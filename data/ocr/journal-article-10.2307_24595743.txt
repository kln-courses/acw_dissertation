<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elizabeth Richards Rivenbark Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body Midcentury artists are known for their reactions to the cerebral nature of Abstract Expressionism, whether through the inclu sion of everyday objects, like the three dimensional materials in Robert Rauschenberg's combines that reject the sanctity of 'fine' art (especially painting), or through popular culture imagery and techniques, such as Andy Warhol's silkscreens, which deny a psychoanalytic interpretation of the artist. As artist and critic of the time Allan Kaprow stated in his oft quoted Artnews article of 1958, after Pollock, artists had to consider the experiences and objects around them.1 By incorporating worldly materials and images, these artists brought representation back to the avant garde. For Alan Solomon, the new figuration found in this rep resentational art suggested the human form without the heroic classical humanism of the past, instead showing contemporary man as a monstrous figure of corruption and hopelessness.2 The repetitive use of chairs and other furniture in sculptural forms in the 1960s in particular, certainly suggested, in a 'real' way, the presence of the human form without the figure, but not merely to suggest man's rise or fall but the contemporary state of humanity. Artists in Europe and America used the iconography of the empty chair as a way to respond to social conditions that reflected the lack of heroic humanism in contemporary society; Europe in the 1960s was still recovering from the destruction of World War II physically and psychologically; alternately America was involved in the Cold War and the Red Scare of communism. The fact that Elizabeth Richards Rivenbark Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body</page><page sequence="2">Elizabeth Richards Rivenbark these sculptural forms occurred across various art movements suggests an accepted iconography for the absent body among artists who wanted to address the human condition in its con temporary state without addressing the heroic classical form. The only way they saw to reject that classical heroism was to avoid the human form altogether. The 1960s, with its inclusion of words, symbols, and systems in Neo-Dada, Pop, and Conceptual Art, reflected a change in ide ology that paralleled a concurrent change in philosophy. Linguist Ferdinand de Saussure's study of sign systems had recently evolved into Structuralism in France in the 1950s. As a type of se miotic study, Structuralism assumes that cultural expressions like art are composed of signs and that signs have meaning beyond their visual form. In traditional iconographic analysis, a sign is identified with a culturally specific meaning, but in Structuralism, the sign is studied across larger social structures and in universal forms to identify parallels in content and iconography. Saussure believed in universal signs: that some signs transcended cultural or chronological relationships, thereby identifying them as innate to humanity. To apply this to the appearance of chairs in the art of the 1960s, a comparison to other examples of empty chairs as signs will show that the form signifies the absent body in a vari ety of cultures and eras (Saussure's horizontal axis or syntagm that deals with the positioning or location of the sign) but that the iconographic reading varies slightly according to the artists' social and cultural concerns, in this case between memorial, au tobiography, and a more abstract reference to the physical body (Saussure's vertical associative axis). In accordance with Saussure's idea of universal forms, fur nishings symbolically used to represent the absent body origi nated much earlier than twentieth century art and in locations independent from Western culture. In fact, several ancient cul tures used furnishings specifically for funereal rituals where the furnishings were thought to contain or symbolically represent the recently deceased. Ancient Mesopotamians, as one example, believed that the body contained two shadows, one that was re ferred to as the zaqiqu, which roughly translates to dream soul, and the other called the etemmu, which translates to ghost. These semi-divine shadows had to be loosened from the physical body through certain rituals and would eventually make their way to the Netherworld once the body was buried. However, the shadows would not leave the earth until burial and so remained on the earth without their body for a period of time. The Mesopotami ans wanted to ensure that these shadows were properly cared for during this interim with funerary offerings and so provided a place for them to rest and wait. Wealthier deceased might have a portrait statue for such purposes, but more commonly a chair was used. The chair would be covered with a cloth to protect the shadow and would be given offerings such as bread, water, and hot broth.3 As an object that is used for the latent living body, the chair symbolically suggested a continuation of the individual and provided a resting place for the shadow. The ancient Meso potamians thus identified the form of the chair as more than just a piece of furniture; it was closely associated with the body and a proper place for the location of soul emplacement after death.4 A more recent and Western use of the empty chair in funer ary rituals can be found in the Victorian era. It has been record ed by Ellen Marie Snyder in her article, 'Innocents in a Worldly World: Victorian Children's Gravemarkers', that empty furnish ings including beds and chairs were used as Victorian children's gravemarkers because children were often associated with the domestic sphere, a world of women and purity.5 In her argument, the empty household furnishing reminded the viewer of the un touched nature of the child by outside and worldly forces and also symbolically referred to the forever-unfilled nature of the child's life. Death would ensure these children's perpetual purity.6 More broadly, the unfilled furnishing represented the absence of the corporeal body, heightened in the case of the Adsit marker found in Brooklyn's Greenwood Cemetery by the addition of a small article of clothing tossed over the side and a pair of children's shoes on the seat of the sculpted form. The empty chair, then, as a symbol for the absent body has a history in American funerary monuments and easily translates forward to more modern uses of the chair to symbolically represent the human figure. Proof of the power of this symbolism can also be found in a whimsical urban legend that supports the anthropomorphism of furniture in the Victorian era; legend has it that the legs of ta bles and pianos were considered sexually suggestive and thus were hidden beneath opulent brocades and table coverings, however, when this myth is analyzed, it breaks apart. Quality Vic torian era furniture was ornately turned and carved, including the legs, which suggests that they would not have been covered or hidden from view. It is possible that middle class homes covered their table legs in an attempt to hide the caliber of their furnish ings, but this had nothing to do with propriety. The myth might have originated with a travelogue written by Captain Frederick Marryat, his Dairy in America (1837). According to his satirical ac counts regarding the extremism of American modesty, while on his tour in America he visited a girls' seminary and found that in order to maintain the purity of the girls in her charge, the mistress had put 'modest little trousers' on the legs of the pianoforte.7 In deed, the terms used to describe the various parts of furnishings often make references to the human form, the legs of a table, the arms a chair, even knees and feet.8 Marryat's voice was one of satire against Americans, whom he saw as modest to the point of ridiculous. While the Victorian Americans might have had some peculiar customs concerning propriety, suggesting that the din ing room furniture might arouse seems a bit much. However, the myth does solidify the idea that furnishings can in fact be abstract replacements for the body. A more modern theoretical approach to the chair by Bernard Rudofsky shows that furnishings have continued to be anthro 276</page><page sequence="3">Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body 1.

In his Behind the Picture Window (1955), Rudof sky referred to the obvious anthropomorphic nature of the chair, which, with its four legs, acts almost as a pet within the home, bestowing a sense of comfort in its recognizable animal form.9 Yet, a chair is made of human proportions and for human nature (with the seat and back suggesting an affinity for the upright) not the four-legged companion. Viewers relate to furnishings on a personal and physical plane, not as a pet but as an abstraction in relationship to the human form. The widespread use of the empty chair to represent the ab sent body shows ideological connections between various and sometimes unrelated cultures and eras that can be associated with Saussure's horizontal axis of semiotics. If we accept the iconographic reading of the empty chair as a universal signifier for a signified absent body we are then left questioning why this sign appears so frequently in the 1960s. Certainly there are examples of the empty chair found earlier in the modern art world, think of Van Gogh's oft analyzed pair of chair portraits, Van Gogh's Chair (1888; Fig. 1) and Gauguin's Armchair (1888), which were meant to show the contrasting personalities of the artists. In these two paintings, Van Gogh used the chair to stand in for the human forms so that the personalities represented would be the focal point, not the human form itself. The empty chair also appears in two-dimensional art in the mid 1960s such as Warhol's series of Electric Chairs, Richard Diebenkorn's Folding Chair (1961), and Philip Guston's Chair and Building (1969). Earlier artistic exam ples of the empty chair in three dimensions were less frequent until sculpture was released from its ideological and physical pedestal. According to Rosalind Krauss in 'Sculpture in the Ex panded Field', sculpture maintained an allegiance to location, acting as a marker, until the end of the nineteenth century.10 The contemporary incorporation of furnishings in sculpture had its precursors in the assemblage art of the 1950s, though the use of found objects and furnishings in particular, can be traced back much farther to Duchamp, Schwitters, and even the col lages of Picasso and Braque. According to Clement Greenberg in his 'The Pasted-Paper Revolution', critics identified collage as an artist's attempt to reconnect to reality in work that might oth erwise be disconnected or abstracted from nature.11 He cited the work of Picasso and Braque in particular as introducing collage by mixing sand and other materials into their paint to emphasize the surface reality, later pasting paper and cloth into their work for added texture, pattern, and trompe I'oeil effects.12 By using three dimensional materials, these artists flattened the plane of illusion and blurred the visual effects of their abstract imagery. In William C. Seitz's (1961) Art of Assemblage, he pointed out several im portant differences between the cubist collage tradition begun by Picasso and the later assemblagists who followed in the wake of Abstract Expressionism, including but not limited to the associa tions with the materials and the overall composition. He claimed that the raw materials assemblagists used often had identifiable associations in their previous lives as objects and that the con figuration of these materials was random or poetic, whereas cub ist collage maintained some form of rationalized composition: in its centralized organization, Picasso's Still Life with Chair Caning maintained an allegiance to a still life on a caned chair.13 Early examples of artists using found objects and creating assem blages such as Duchamp, Schwitters, and other Dada artists had taken objects out of context and used them to express irrational ity. According to Seitz, assemblagists used objects with specific associations; for artists who incorporated fabric and furnishings, those associations referred directly to personal life. While we will see that this was the case with some assemblagists in the 1950s, it is debatable in the context of earlier assemblagists. Kurt Schwitters, for example, clearly eliminated the personal as well as his materials' associations from his assemblages. He believed that when a material was incorporated into his assemblages, the original meaning of that material was lost in the greater whole of the new object.14 In his Merzbau (1932), he started in a personal space (his home) and by adding the detritus of found materials, he removed the personal element from the space and made it a reflection of broader culture. Seitz's argument that found mate rial is always personal breaks down here and is not always the case for midcentury artists. Allan Kaprow identified Abstract Expressionism and Pol lock's work in particular as leading to the period's assem blages. He stated, 'Pollock [...] left us at the point where we must become preoccupied with and even dazzled by the space and objects of our everyday life [...]'.15 Pollock's action paint ing made his process and materials real and immediate to the viewer; in 'The 'Uunk" Aesthetic: Assemblage of the 1950s and Early 1960s', Roni Feinstein supported this idea by stating that the assemblagists wanted to emulate Pollock's immediacy and physicality by manipulating real world objects in real space.16 It was not long after Pollock that midcentury artists began to in corporate the debris of life into their art. Feinstein argued that it was the Abstract Expressionists' individual gestures that made their work personal and that the assemblagists lacked this rela tionship of the individual to the canvas. Incorporating materials that referred to popular culture allowed assemblagists to critique contemporary throwaway culture and also encouraged viewers to react to the objects on a personal level. Similar to Schwitters' idea about an object's meaning being eliminated when com bined into an assemblage, she referred to the material objects as anonymous, insisting that they merely asserted their literal presence.17 Seitz, however, identified the personal in the associ ations that objects carried, claiming that the unique sensibility of each viewer further modified the work.18 In her book Assemblage (1987), Jeanne Marie Wasilik maintained that the assemblagists' materials were charged with associations to their past lives and that the artists used these associations in a poetic manner, creat ing layers of meaning through their juxtaposition.19 It is in their 278</page><page sequence="5">Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body 2.

Midcentury artists then were using found materials to con nect their art to real life in a physical way. It is not surprising that many of these artists want to return to art that dealt with human experience and personal experience in a socially and politically tumultuous time. Yet, many were not ready to confront reality with figurative representations. To create figurative art is either to fol low or to reject the classical heroicizing of the figure found in the Western cannon of art. In the '50s and '60s, still reeling from World War II and immersed in Cold War culture and the begin nings of the Vietnam War, artists were wary of representations of the human form. The chair, as a signifier of the physical human body assumed many iconographic meanings for midcentury art ists from autobiographical references to memorials for the de ceased and more abstract commentaries on the human body in contemporary experience. By using materials that were commonplace, artists ensured viewers' relationship with the work. In an early example of mid century empty chair assemblage, Robert Rauschenberg exploit ed this principle by hanging an ordinary household chair from a painting in his Pilgrim (1960; Fig. 2). In the late 1940s, the Ab stract Expressionists abandoned associations with the tangible world and focused on the artist as an individual. In the wake of this tradition, Rauschenberg was criticized for his use of found objects, which held their own narratives, although he continued the Abstract Expressionist tradition of self-exploration through his media. Rauschenberg incorporated autobiographical aspects in his assemblages, which he referred to as combines, through gestural painting and the fabrics and various found objects he appropriated. In a famous quote, he acknowledged the relation ship between his art and his life, stating: 'Painting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. I try to act in the gap between the two'.20 Rauschenberg integrated found and personal objects into his work to link his personal life to his art: if painting was the medium between art and life then the application of objects with personal meaning to his canvases played an integral part in act ing within the gap. Although Rauschenberg approached his use of materials on a personal level, he acknowledged Kurt Schwit ters' art as an inspiration when, after seeing a Schwitters exhibit at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1959, he stated, 'I felt like he made it all just for me'.21 Rauschenberg also employed industrial refuse and con sumer products to critique social idiosyncrasies of depression era frugality and later throwaway consumer culture. In Pilgrim, the chair becomes a representation of this culture with its striped layers of paint reflecting various aspects of society. The chair began as a wooden varnished chair, which Rauschenberg paint ed with two stripes, one on each side. On the viewer's right, Rauschenberg painted a bright yellow stripe onto the chair. It is separated from the wooden varnished center by a clean line as if taped or machine manufactured. This side represents the new or the most up-to-date, which had become an obsession in modern consumer culture. On the viewer's left, Rauschenberg painted a white stripe, though it leaves a very different impres sion. The white stripe appears aged, as if the artist abraded the paint with sandpaper. Even the two feet of the chair on the left side are worn down, chunks of them missing, as if the chair had been kicked often and over many years. This single chair, new on one side, aged on the other, represents the duality of consumer culture as Rauschenberg lived it, growing up with Depression era frugality and then finding himself in a consumer ist society. By incorporating the empty chair in his assemblage, Rauschenberg referred to the human element in his work and in society. His commentary on the changing face of consumerism is not one about big business but about the human experience in everyday life. In 1961 Claes Oldenburg opened his most ambitious Hap pening, a theatrical piece that incorporated the everyday man and the consumer environment, The Store. An actual business and storefront at 107 East Second Street in New York City, The Store was inspired by the common goods and clothes found in shop windows and sold sculptural replicas of these objects. Oldenburg's goods were made, much like papier-mache, of muslin strips soaked in plaster and laid over a wire armature to dry before being painted. Many of his replicas are of clothing hung on mannequins (as in the Bride) or over chairs (Shirt with Objects on Chair, 1962; Fig. 3, and Blue Pants and Objects on Chair, 1962) thus imitating the human form in their display. While many of the forms in The Store evoke the body by representing clothing, their hard nature denied a sensual aspect and instead evoked a resemblance to sculpted drapery. Germano Celant identified clothing as an objectification of the nude body, but Oldenburg's jagged, hard forms with their harsh solid colors, despite evoking the senses, were rigid fetishized objects.22 It is an impossibility of the body suggested in the hard and gro tesque lumps of the clothing that further humanized Olden burg's found objects, like the chairs, which came from the world of real bodies. Much comparison has been made of Oldenburg's works to the art and the philosophies of French artist Jean Dubuffet; Dubuffet encouraged his audience to search for art in the events of their everyday lives, whereas Oldenburg brought his audience into his art, making The Store a lived artwork and giving life to Dubuffet's philosophies.23 Both artists drew from popular culture in their art and wanted to appeal to the man on the street, but al though Dubuffet critiqued the museum as a cemetery for elitism, he recognized late in his career that his own work would end up a part of it. Oldenburg, however, played on high and low culture in a way that appealed to the masses as both avant-garde and mainstream 24 Oldenburg was using his forms of clothing and 280</page><page sequence="7">Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body 3.

Photo: © 2013 Joseph Kosuth/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York the furnishings they were draped on to suggest the human form to the everyday viewer while commenting on consumer culture in a way that was distanced from the individual. It is not surprising that an early example of conceptual art also took the form of an empty chair. Joseph Kosuth, in his One and Three Chairs (1965; Fig. 4), employed a chair as his point of reference to the multiple forms that a sign can take: in this case, wooden object, photographic documentation, and text. Kosuth's intention with the chair was not to create an aesthetic object, but to force the viewer to think about the many ways of being and inevitably, what makes art, art. Kosuth saw art as continuing from philosophy. In particular, he was interested in the philosophy of language and semiotics, such as in the work of Ludwig Wittgen stein, which he discussed in his artist statement, 'lntention(s)'.25 Wittgenstein outlined the relationship between language and the world it describes, a study which is directly related to One and Three Chairs with its questioning of object, visual representa tion, and verbal (or textual) representation. Which one of these versions of the chair truly represents a chair? The answer lies in how Kosuth instructs the work to be displayed. The curator is instructed to choose a chair, then take a picture of the chair and display it blown up to life size next to the physical chair.

The chair and the photograph are not consistent elements in the display of the artwork; only the text is consistent and can represent any chair or the idea of the chair and thus, the text represents the chair beyond the physical ob ject or the photograph. In his article 'Words and Images: A Per sistent Paradox', Russell Bowman (1985) points out that Kosuth was not the first to use text or to deal with how the viewer re ceives a concept in art. in fact, One and Three Chairs could be seen as a response to Rene Magritte's famous pipe: this is (not) a chair, three ways.26 One and Three Chairs can also be seen as a visual representation of Plato's Theory of Forms. In Book 10 of his Republic, Plato attacks art as mere imitation, twice removed from true forms. According to Plato, objects perceived by man are merely approximations of ideal forms and since art imitates nature, it is even farther from what he considers Truth. A common example used to explain this concept is, interestingly enough, a chair. In Truth, there is the ideal of Chair but every chair made by man is merely an approximation of the ideal Chair, moreover, a painting of a chair (or in this case a photograph) would be an imitation of nature, not of ideal form. More than a questioning of an everyday domestic object, Kosuth's inquiry is one about the nature of art and objects, as is much conceptual art. Conceptual art denounces the need for art to have aesthetic, materialistic, or technical value. Instead, conceptual artists argued that art was worthless if it did not make the viewer think. Conceptual artists continually emphasize the devaluation of the art object, favoring the concept beyond material concerns. In One and Three Chairs, the chair itself is not chosen by the artist, the artist directs a cura tor to choose a chair for the piece. While the empty chair that we see then is not of real importance, the concept of chair-ness is relevant here. Kosuth's parallel works, One and Three Tables and One and Three Hammers enlighten the artist's goal of choosing objects that are directly relational to human interaction. One and Three Chairs goes a step farther; because of the iconography of the empty chair it directly signifies the absent body. Although conceptual art tends to avoid representation in favor of text and geometric form for its visual presence, Kosuth deliberately chose objects that made a connection between art and the human ex perience. Joseph Beuys, too, used a chair as the pedestal on which he was able to comment on his mythical drama of the body, his body. In his Fat Chair (1964; Fig. 5), the fat, which is so frequently displayed in conjunction with the other accoutrements of Beuys' legendary, though questionable, salvation in the Alps by nomadic Tartars, is displayed alone as a wedge, propped up on the seat of a chair. Fat Chair is about the physicality of the human body. Fat appealed to the artist as a composite with no internal structure. Beuys' material interests could be explored through fat since the material itself calls to be considered before form was considered. Max Kozloff pointed out that until the 1960s, all sculptures were made of hard materials; hard sculptures fought the nature of grav ity, making figurative sculpture, in particular, the ideal version of the human form as it defied the effects of age and gravity. He fur ther hypothesized that soft sculpture could suggest the less ideal aspects of the human form: fatigue, deterioration, and inertia. Ac cording to Kozloff all soft sculpture naturally referred to the hu man body because of the sense of entropy physical materials im plied in them.27 The man-made form of a right angle represented the rigidity of the space within the chair as opposed to the organic form of the body. Beuys has reduced the body to a symbolic pres ence within the work. Rudofsky suggested that chairs always act as pedestals, displaying the human body, forcing it to play by social rules. He reasons, this is why children dislike highchairs and often reject proper positioning on chairs as an act of rebel lion against social norms.28 Gary Michael Dault supplements this explanation of the child's rebellion in his article, 'Four Legs Good: The Anthropological Chair as Historical House Pet', stating that chairs are not inherently a comfortable structure for the body; furthermore, the upright positioning is confrontational, in a way, forcing the sitter into the position of dialogue.29 In Fat Chair, this confrontation takes place between the viewer and the object, in which case, as it is covered in and supporting fat, the chair be comes a surrogate for the human body. The location of the fat on the chair and the slope of the fat suggest a form of confrontation and rebellion. Furthermore, if we read the chair as a body, the fat is located at the digestive area of the body giving the sculpture an abject quality. The fat is a reminder of bodily excrement in its location and in its material qualities. Since we identify fat with the intake of food by the human form, this is an easy association. The uncontained fat rebels against the idea of a pristine upright body, repulsing the viewer. Beuys has forced a dialogue with his viewer by taking advantage of the social convention of the chair. The abject quality of the work is also projected in an alterna tive reading of Beuys' work as a subliminal commentary on the Holocaust. As a German who actively participated in the military during World War II, it is not surprising to find references to the human atrocities in Beuys' art. Beuys' materials, especially the felt and fat that repeatedly appear in his work, are materials with unique signifiers during the war. Stories abounded immediately after the war of the Nazi use of human bodies for various army supplies, many of which have since been proven true. Nazis col lected many materials from the bodies of their victims for later use including the clothes and shoes worn by the victims, but also the very materials of the body, the hair for instance was used to make felt for blankets and socks for Nazi soldiers. Fat, too, was collected from the bodies for the production of soap.30 In this reading, Beuys' empty chair is more than a signifier of one ab sent body but six million. The empty chair acts as a sign for the corporeal body while avoiding the classical heroic form. Whether the viewer reads it as an abstract physical one or as a symbolic memorial for the desecrated, this absent body is the abject body. 284</page><page sequence="11">Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body 6.

Robert Rauschenberg's Bed, Judy Chicago's dinner table; modern artists have frequently utilized domestic furnish ings as the site of the abject body, a body whose boundaries are fluid and ill-contained. Julia Kristeva, in her book Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, defined the abject as that which 'beseeches a discharge, a convulsion, a crying out', it is 'not lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection, but what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, posi tions, rules'.31 According to Kristeva's definition, abjection can be applied to any object or idea that crosses boundaries, though she dealt specifically with the boundaries of the body. Furnish ings take on the intimate nature of this boundary crossing as the body's resting place, the site of nourishment, and the location of the primal act. Furnishings not only appropriate the abject aspects of the body (detritus, smell), they also appropriate the scale and proportions of the body. As the abject body is in direct opposition to the classical one, which is idealized in more than mere form, furnishings easily replace the abject human form for signification. By turning common objects into art, Christo related his work to real life, similar to other artists of the 1950s and 1960s who im bued their art with reality through the incorporation of found ma terials. Christo, known for landscape installations and wrapped buildings with his artistic partner (and wife) Jeanne-Claude, be gan his artistic career wrapping small everyday objects, such as bottles and a chair, to defy the value of art. Unlike his contem poraries, who mainly applied real world objects to a canvas or sculpture, he wrapped his found objects in fabric, effectively re moving the object from use. David Bourdon, in his book Christo (1972), indicated that the object's removal from reality made it both dormant and infused with alternative value: wrapping con noted gift-giving, death, or possibly preservation, actions related to worth.32 Carrie Rickey also dealt with the issue of cloth and value in her article, 'Unwrapping Christo'. She emphasized that the object, though of relatively minimal monetary value, gained meaning as it was wrapped or suggestively draped, giving it new contours and dimensions 33 Christo's Wrapped Chair (1961; Fig. 6) reflects the alteration in value and meaning taken on by the object in these situations. With the wrapping of the chair in cloth, the chair suggests the body that typically inhabits the fur niture. Like a disheveled robe or toga, the fabric is wrapped and draped across the chair, concealing many of the joints of the chair while revealing the main structure and in fact, Christo and Jeanne-Claude encouraged a connection between many of their later wrapped pieces and the draping of the body. Artists frequently use cloth to represent the body; referred to as a second skin, cloth repeats many of the roles of skin, which encases and protects the interior body. Wearing clothing is a uni versal tactile experience, making it an easy medium to evoke personal experiences in the viewer as well as expressing issues of culturally and personally constructed identity.34 In the case of Wrapped Chair, the cloth is not the pristine cloth of a toga, most frequently envisioned in its pure white marble form, but instead a filthy rag-like cloth that carries its own signifiers. Just as with blemishes on the body, a viewer of such an object would notice the imperfection foremost as the irregularity in color or pattern or texture attracts the eye. Worn, torn, or stained areas on cloth are inevitably caused by human interaction through close relation ship with the body. In this way, cloth sustains a space between abstraction and depiction of the body's presence. In his corner stone work, Matter and Memory (1911), Henri Bergson referred to this transitory space between abstraction and depiction, be tween mind and body as the space of memory.35 Cloth, however, cannot hide its memory in the deep recesses of a mind. Jenni Sorkin, in her article, 'Stain: On Cloth, Stigma and Shame', stated that, when a piece of cloth receives a stain or tear it maintains a permanent scar and cannot forget the laceration but instead re tains a form of physical memory.36 She identified these physical blemishes on cloth as heightening the connection between cloth and skin. She found that cloth so frequently takes on the role of skin by protecting and approximating the form of the body that it becomes an easily transferred symbol of the body. In this case the worn and stained cloth wrapped around the chair projects the interaction with physical bodies including one very visceral, deep red stain on the seat of the Wrapped Chair. In a more pristine, theoretical venue, Jeanne-Claude likened the artistic team's attraction to fabric to the historic fascination with drapery, which she emphasized has been a concern for art ists for over 5,000 years, an appeal that pertained to the body beneath the pleats and folds.37 Fabric as costume highlights the body's contours as much as it conceals them; it emphasizes fashionable parts of the body depending on current trends to show a whisper of an ankle or the curve of a waistline. Fabric is draped around the body in much the same way Christo and Jeanne-Claude draped their artistic arena. Bourdon compared Christo to a fashion designer who drapes directly on the mod el; a 'couturier' using twine.38 Christo himself even equated his cloaking of objects to Rodin's sculptural effects in Balzac, as sculpting a nude figure and then draping it in a cloak to be cast. The resulting form teased the viewer with the body rendered be neath its shield, just as Christo's own wrapped projects teased with the forms beneath them.39 Jeanne-Claude responded to Christo's comparison by explaining that cloaking the details and emphasizing the forms beneath rendered the 'essence' of the object or landscape for viewers.40 The fabric in their installations acted like a veil as it might on the human body, and just as cloth ing is often referred to as the body's second skin, Christo com pared his fabric to a layer of skin for the object, here the chair.41 Western culture has prized the chair for its rigidity and up right nature, making it a perfect symbol for the containment of the human body by social expectations. Twentieth century artists 286</page><page sequence="13">Corporeal Furnishings in the Sixties: Furniture as Art and Its Intimacy with the Body have frequently utilized interior furnishings as familiar objects that possess diverse meanings and thus can be manipulated in such a way as to recall personal experience while indicating broader cultural significance. The anthropomorphic nature of the chair with its back, seat, arms, legs, and feet, approximates the scale of the body making the chair or the bed an appropriate location for discussions of the corporeal. A chair also retains its own auto biography: like a living being it shows its age through the use and abuse of the form upon it. As a signifier of the domestic sphere, chairs inhabit a very personal space, and speak to a particular socio-economic class depending on style and ornamentation. Early modernists recognized the chair as a social site and an apt representation of the body; contemporary artists continue to utilize its varied signifiers, adapting its form to speak their own artistic concerns regarding the body. The empty chair as a signifier of the absent body has vary ing meanings along Saussure's vertical axis from social impli cations of the lack of humanity in contemporary society to the abject or otherwise unidealized physical body. Artists in Europe arid in America reacted to the lack of humanism present in the midcentury socio-political arena often by avoiding the human form in their art but they still felt the need to broach concerns with contemporary humanity. The empty chair allowed Rauschen berg, Oldenburg, and Beuys to comment on the unspeakable: Rauschenberg and Oldenburg to criticize American consumer ism without gaining the attention of communist investigators; Beuys to make reference to the horrors of the Holocaust with out being politically confrontational. Beuys chair, however, is not quite empty as it contains a wedge of fat referring to the abject body and how it rejects physical and social boundaries. Christo's chair also refers to the abject body as well as, like conceptual art ist Kosuth, a more direct reference to the wide expanse between the classical heroic vision of the human form and the contempo rary human experience. The empty chair, a global signifier of the absent human body has become for the artists of the 1960s an apt sign for the contemporary human condition. 1 A.

In one instance while Marryat was in the company of a young woman, she tripped and he inquired whether she had injured her leg, the young woman was aghast at his foul language and corrected him, saying only under duress would such extremities be referred to and the more proper term in her company would be 'limb' (Marryat, p. 273). 9 B.

My research often brought me into contact with artists who approached fabric through the domestic sphere as the origination or location of au tobiographical associations. I discovered the importance of the tactility of cloth on artists' sensibilities and as a way for artists to bridge a rela tionship with their viewers. 35 H. Bergson, Matter and Memory, trans. N. M.
