Aziz Z. Huq Torture and Democracy Darius Rejali Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008 Torture and the Twilight of Empire: From Algiers to Baghdad Marnia Lazreg Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007 On May 8, 2002, Jose Padilla flew from Pakistan into O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Before he passed U.S. Customs, he was seized and detained by federal agents. After a month of criminal confine- ment, President George W. Bush desig- nated him as an "enemy combatant" liable to indefinite detention in a South Carolina naval brig. It was another two years before Padilla's case arrived at the U.S. Supreme Court. After months of almost constant in- communicado detention, Padilla was told by a bare majority of five Justices that he had filed in the wrong judicial district - and that he would have to endure further months' of detention as he corrected his procedural error.1 Of course, as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent, the case raised larger issues than the venue rules of federal courts, issues that touched on the quality of American democracy for suspect and upright citizens alike. "Even more im- portant than the method of selecting the people's ruler and their successors," Justice Stevens noted, "is the character of the con- straints imposed on the Executive by the rule of law."2 This review essay takes that seemingly fundamental claim to task by examining the relationship between democracy and torture. Democracy, Justice Stevens might be taken as saying, is less important than constraints on government. Or, to read the statement for all it is worth, Stevens' claim might be that a connection must exist between demo- cratic governance and these constraints: That democracy, or at least its American variant, is at base liberal in the sense John Stuart Mill meant, in that it entails a mini- mum level of respect for persons and a basic quantum of liberty as preconditions of dem- ocratic governance.3 Principal among the liberal constraints that underlie democracy is the rule against torture. While the Padilla case on its face concerned the power to detain, in its murkier interstices lurked torture. Padilla, after all, had been in criminal custody for more than a month before he was first shunted into military detention. No exi- gency, no risk of an imminent dirty-bomb explosion, motivated the shift into military custody. Rather, military detention was use- ful because it opened options for interroga- tion that civilian detention did not.4 © 2008 World Policy Institute 99</page><page sequence="2">As his lawyer subsequently detailed in court papers, Padilla was held in "stark iso- lation" for "nearly two years" after his initial arrest in a tiny cell - nine feet by seven feet - with no view to the outside world. During this time, he was subjected to sleep deprivation, extremes of temperature, and stress positions (through shackling and manacling), i.e., the repertoire of measures familiar from accounts of "extraordinary ren- dition" and Central Intelligence Agency (cia) black sites overseas. In common with those renditions, the aim was to break Padilla down, to render him dependent on and compliant with his captors.5 Yet mere miles away, the residents of Charleston went on their way, reading newspapers, dis- cussing candidates, and voting in 2002 congressional elections, 2004 primaries, and 2004 presidential races. Even as news about CIA black sites, water-boarding, and Haditha accreted, democratic life went on. Deconstructing "Torture" That democracy and torture are necessarily incompatible is a powerful and attractive in- tuition, to which Stevens only had to allude to make his opinion bite. The intuition might, though, be described in a number of ways. Consider here three possibilities. First, we might see a structural connection be- tween governance rooted in popular ac- countability and transparency on the one hand, and the infrequency of state brutality. States rely not merely on the monopoliza- tion of force but on broad legitimacy, which is undermined by use of widespread torture. Alternatively, democracy, unlike the rules of authoritarian states, provides the oppor- tunity for popular protest and mobilization against torture.6 The naming and shaming that is possible only in democracies, in other words, can limit the feasibility of torture. Finally, the causal mechanism can flow the other way. It is not so much that democracy limits the use of torture, but that the mere availability of torture as a tool of state con- trol undermines the possibility of democracy itself. Call these the legitimacy thesis, the mobilization thesis, and the condition of democratic possibility thesis. Recent American experience suggests, however, that torture in fact is compatible with democracy at least over the medium term in which democratic intentions mani- fest. That the United States at times en- gages in torture has not been in public doubt since April 28, 2004, when CBS broadcast the first photographs of Iraqi pris- oners being abused and tortured in the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. The administra- tion immediately branded the images as the product of a "few bad apples," an argument implicitly underwritten by the "aberrant, outlandish character of what the photo- graphs showed."7 On May 7, 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told the Senate and House Armed Services Committees that "these terrible acts were perpetrated by a small number of the U.S. military," and that "the President didn't know... and I didn't know."8 But evidence since accumulated - not least in the Padilla case - has demon- strated that torture has been pervasive and remains today permissible U.S. policy.9 More than four years, two congressional election cycles, and one presidential ballot later, democratically elected officials still claim ignorance and uncertainty about the pervasive use of torture. In confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Com- mittee, for example, Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey professed to having no view as to whether water- boarding is a form of torture. "I don't know what's involved in the technique," Mukasey told Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, "//water-boarding is torture, torture is not constitutional."10 Yet water-boarding is commonly known to be a pain-generating technique that has been used since the Spanish Inquisition.11 Indeed, its use as a tool of torture is a staple of popular culture, seen in movies ranging from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Petit Soldat to the recent Jake Gyllenhaal vehicle Rendition.12 1 00 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • WINTER 2007/08</page><page sequence="3">And it has been repeatedly mentioned and debated as one of the "enhanced" interroga- tion techniques permitted to the CIA.13 For a prospective U.S. Attorney General to claim that he does not know enough about a para- digmatic method of torture is either incredi- ble or proof of incompetence. Despite Abu Ghraib, therefore, torture remains a suffi- ciently embedded attribute of the American legal system that it can become the central point of contention in the nomination of the nation s senior law enforcement officer. Tor- ture, in contradiction to the condition of possibility thesis, seemingly can coexist with democratic governance. Two recent books on the etiology and ef- florescence of torture demonstrate that many democracies torture. America is simply not exceptional in this regard. And salient here, the persistence of democratic torture raises grave doubts about both the legitimacy and the mobilization theses. "Clean" or "Stealth" Torture Darius Rejali's Torture and Democracy , a decade in the making, will be the canonical source text for information on, and the his- torical confirmation of, the democratic pedi- gree of tortures that leave no mark. Such methods, which Rejali, a professor at Reed College, calls "stealth tortures,"14 include water tortures, the use of electricity, stress and duress positions, forced standings, noise, and stun guns. Rejali denominates these "stealth" or "clean"15 because they leave little or no physical trace. Further, Rejali notes, they demand no specialized equipment, but rely on devices that are easily available and "dual use" such that their presence in the interrogation room or among interrogators' belongings gives nothing away. In mid-century war zones such as Vietnam, for example, American soldiers turned to the magneto, a common device f or powering field telephones that produces powerful electric shocks, for torture.16 In Argentina, torturers used the picana, an elec- trified cattle goad wielded by ranchers since the 1930s.17 Such torture is both hard to de- tect immediately and also hard to prove af- ter the fact, when it becomes the word of the torturer against that of the victim. Stealth torture, furthermore, is the norm today. Rare indeed is the contemporary regime - Burma and pre-invasion Iraq leap to mind - that will widely practice torture in ways that leave physical marks. In relating the appearance and spread of stealth torture, Rejali is testing, and in my view successfully proving, a simple hypothesis: "There is a long, unbroken, though largely forgotten history of torture in democracies at home and abroad." Specif- ically, this is the history of stealth torture.18 In the book's central arc, he maps the slow development and dissemination of electro- torture this from its first use by the British in the 1910s to 1930s in the Andaman Islands19 - to its domestic refinement by the independent American inventor John Cover, who named his stun weapon the TASER after a children's book, Tom A. Swift and his Elec- tric Rifle.20 In fact, Rejali shows that stealth tor- tures such as electricity have developed specifically within democracies. And in his preamble, Rejali, almost apologetically, can- vasses the use of torture in Nazi Germany, Vichy France, and Soviet Russia to demon- strate that totalitarian states have no need for stealth: Torturers in such nations need not hide their tools nor practice their craft with an eye to the cleanliness of their final palate. (The one exception, Rejali notes, were the show trials organized by Joseph Stalin beginning in 1931, trials that relied on the defendant's manifest and contrite performance of guilt, a charade that would have been exposed by daubed bruises or other evidence of coercion.)21 Stealth torture is the child of democracy, not totalitarian government. Democracies, moreover, do not merely torture. They also develop their own "regi- mens," or styles, of torture that are handed "Democratic Torture" 101</page><page sequence="4">down by folktale and word of mouth, a mat- ter of whispered professional culture rather than CIA manuals or Soviet instructors.22 It is not enough for Rejali to show that the dominant mode of torture today originated in democracies: His history also records each democracy's own inimitable taste for certain kinds of torture. Rejali notes that styles change. In the mid-1990s, the Turkish police suddenly abandoned the decades-old use of the falaka, a beating torture aimed at the soles of the feet. And, by the 1970s, the picana went from being a uniquely Argentine device to one that could be found from Greece to Rhodesia to Madagascar to China.23 In par- ticular, Rejali describes a spread of stealth torture techniques into authoritarian coun- tries in the 1970s, a trend that seemingly disrupts the thread tying democracies with stealth torture. How can this be explained? Rejali makes a powerful case that it was the spread of human rights monitoring in the 1970s that fostered the adoption of "clean" methods in authoritarian countries. Faced with the risk of shaming publicity, rational torturers first in democracies and only later in authoritarian states shifted from high- cost visible measures to clean measures, i.e., from methods that carry high costs in terms of public obloquy to low-visibility methods. As public scrutiny increased, the "simplicity and ordinariness" of tools also became pivotal.24 Hence stealth torture's spread. Increased media and watchdog scrutiny appears strong enough to explain even varia- tions within certain national regimes. In locations such as British Kenya in the 1950s and Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and southern Lebanon, Rejali observes, stealth torture was deployed in lieu of overt methods because monitoring was better and more intensive. Monitoring, however, made more of a difference when a broader public became aware of its findings. Britons, for example, were relatively indifferent to the suffering of Kenyans, until publicity exposed atrocities so horrific as to warrant notice.25 The Kenyan experience suggests that publicizing torture imposes costs on states only if the results of monitoring take on larger public significance. Indifference as much as igno- rance can be deadly. Despite the seemingly perverse effect of human rights monitoring, these case studies suggest that the shift from overt to stealth techniques is one that exacts costs for states: Finding ways to torture and then to hide it use is more costly than torturing in plain sight. The global rise of the human rights movements, in particular organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty In- ternational, focused on the physical abuse of prisoners and provided the spur to the spread of stealth techniques. That shift is the perverse tribune of vice to virtue, evi- dence that social movements grounded on shared ethical principles can and do have an impact on both international norms and practices.26 The Algerian Model Marnia Lazreg's study of Algerian torture, by contrast, is narrower in scope and more capacious in its methodology than Rejali's work. It is solely concerned with the French effort to retain control of Algeria as depart- ments within the Third Republic in the 1950s and 1960s. Lazreg's book evolved from her sociological research among Alger- ian women and the simultaneous publica- tion of Paul Aussaresses' stark, first-hand ac- count of the Battle of Algiers.27 It draws, however, on an eclectic range of disciplines to make its argument, from history and anthropology to psychology and critical theory. But methodological variety undermines her narrative and argumentative force. The book switches from organizational psychol- ogy to feminist theory to traditional histori- ography from chapter to chapter so that no clear thesis emerges. Individually, each of Lazreg's arguments are telling: There is a powerful chapter on the slow militarization 102 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • WINTER 2007/08</page><page sequence="5">of the colonial state, which shows how the attrition of wartime stress corroded the civilian bureaucracy in Algeria into a con- fused meshwork of agencies entangled in confused lines of authority. It suggests the relevance of institutional change, a factor Rejali otherwise downplays.28 Yet Lazreg, a professor at Hunter College, does not suffi- ciently pursue the insight. She does not map fully the consequences of institutional trans- formation. Instead, she digressively explores the background ideologies of the French counter-insurgency, leaving open the ques- tion of how, or why, institutional form mat- ters. The result is a set of sometimes pierc- ing particular insights that do not quite rise to the level of general persuasion. Methodological profligacy also leads to errors a book on torture should not make. Bizarrely, Lazreg draws a distinction be- tween "[snapping a victim" one time, and "a group of soldiers going at it together," and suggests only the latter is torture.29 This is dangerous confusion. Torture, as a matter of long-standing and unequivocal interna- tional law, imposes no durational require- ment insofar as physical harm is concerned. A single slap or submersion in water for even a brief second can constitute torture. Ironically, Lazreg 's restrictive view of torture corresponds to a naive understanding in American popular culture that has been ex- ploited by the Bush administration: namely, that torture only corresponds to grosser, cinematic examples of state violence.30 In a December 2004 legal memorandum that still remains official policy, the U.S. Justice Department took the contrary position by arguing that the Convention against Torture and the federal anti-torture statute includes a durational requirement for physical tor- ture.31 It is not too much to ask the author of scholarly book on torture, no less than a government lawyer authoring a rule for in- terrogators, to be precise about the scope and sense of the term. Nor does Lazreg draw a persuasive con- clusion concerning the connection of democ- racy to torture (which, to be fair, is not her main topic). Torture, she persuasively ar- gues, is not "primarily about information." Rather, "the democratic state in crisis is es- pecially attracted to torture because it is pure power" that provides a means for "re- sourcing" and "rejuvenating itself." Torture, in Lazreg s telling, is an emotional response to a national identity crisis catalyzed by the collapse of empire.32 This account, however, does not explain the variety that Lazreg herself maps. It seems to rest on an awkward psychoanalytic anthropomorphism about the state. Without question, Lazreg is illuminating ideological constructs that allowed some French mili- tary leaders (but not all) to see themselves as recrafting the Algerians as "new men," fit to be part of la patrie. But how do psychologi- cal or psychoanalytic notions of anxiety, as- suagement, or rejuvenation translate to na- tion states?33 To say that the nation is anxiously re- constituting its identity, as the Cornell political theorist Benedict Anderson has shown, raises a series of new questions about the means and terms by which national identity is formulated and reformulated.34 How does such an account explain the strik- ing differences Lazreg illuminates between different individual French military leaders in Algeria? Didn't they share the same ide- ology?35 How does it explain the French claim, echoed today by American military leaders, that they were fighting a "'new' kind of war," that demanded novel (and im- plicitly more brutal) counter-insurgency methods?36 Was it French views about the "quasi-indelible" condition of being Mus- lim, views that have surprising persistent currency today?37 And what connects the highly sexual- ized individual accounts of torture Lazreg provides with the dynamics of governmen- tality she raises in passing?38 To read torture psychoanalytically, and to project that matrix back onto the torturing state, in short, seems at least to risk a conflation of "Democratic Torture" 103</page><page sequence="6">individual narrative with collective dy- namic. It also leads to the commission of serious category error, i.e., the overly reduc- tionism assignment of individual states of mind to dispersed social entities.39 The Basic Conundrum Where do these histories leave the thorny issue of democracies and torture? Without question, they counter powerfully the argu- ment that the rule against torture is, in its application, a precondition of democracy. Torture coexists with democracy, albeit gen- erally cloaked in plausible deniability. In this sense, Judge Mukasey may be faithful to a democratic tradition of repudiating tor- ture in name, while tolerating it in fact. Further, the histories recounted by Rejali and Lazreg force nuance into the le- gitimacy and the mobilization accounts of the relationship of torture and democracy. By exploring the self-consciously ideological accounts of the French colonial experience, Lazreg shows that torture can be logically consistent with the state's effort to legit- imize itself. Further, Rejali's work exhaus- tively demonstrates that monitoring does not extinguish torture - it displaces it, changes its modality, and (perhaps) reduces its frequency. The need for legitimacy in democratic states, and their vulnerability to monitoring, in other words, might change the kind of torture democracies use or its frequency; but they do not seem to change the fact of democratic torture. To push one further step, Justice Stevens is perhaps incorrect to align democracy with liberal constraints on the state. Perhaps tor- ture, in particular, can be made congruent with liberal ideology. As Professor David Luban has artfully explained, this can and has been done by recent advocates of coer- cive interrogation policies. Much recent writing on torture takes a "highly stylized and artificial" view of torture - the lens of the famous "ticking bomb" hypothetical - that furnishes a convenient cost-benefit justification of torture for intelligence- gathering purposes in the face of cata- strophic events. While Luban properly re- sists the simplifying assumptions that feed this hypothetical, his point has considerable logical force: A liberal state engaged in the weighing of costs and benefits can, consis- tent with its own ideology, condone torture by anchoring its cost-benefit analysis in the "ticking bomb" hypothetical. This logic comes at the cost of forgetting the murky cultural and historical traces that Rejali and Lazreg labor to uncover, but it allows some kind of reconciliation - a false and uneasy one, to be sure - between liberal democracy and torture.40 If torture can be democratic, how do democracies change when they torture? As Lazreg notes, the strains of the Algerian war precipitated a failed military putsch against Charles de Gaulle in April 1961, 14 months before the Evian Accords brought about Algerian independence.41 Put glibly, the torturers could not abide the fact of democracy. Recent experience in the United States suggests that torture might not be antithetical to democracy, but might nonetheless corrode its structural bases. Consider in this regard the connec- tion between torture and secrecy. One of the implications of Rejali s emphasis on moni- toring and the costs of disclosure is that states that torture will do their best to avoid either conceding that they torture or reveal- ing evidence that they torture. Indeed, the Bush administration has gone to extraordi- nary lengths to obscure the fact that torture is used as a matter of state policy in coun- terterrorism operations - arranging for in- terrogations to occur in offshore black sites, outsourcing torture to third countries, and contorting domestic and international law so as to create ambiguities that permit forms of torture (such as water-boarding) while maintaining the semblance of humanity. All this saps the principle of accounta- bility that lies at democracy's heart. A re- cent example is the July 20, 2007, presiden- 1 04 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • WINTER 2007/08</page><page sequence="7">tial order defining a CIA regime of interroga- tion. While superficially ruling out torture, the order in fact contains strategic omissions and ambiguities. The order's list of "basic necessities of life," for example, does not include sleep, thus leaving the ancient tor- ture of sleep deprivation available as a pur- portedly legal option.42 Another example is the decision to record coercive interroga- tions of al Qaeda suspects, but then to destroy the resulting tapes. As police across the country know well, taped interviews provide an invaluable and continuing source of information, and allow others not present at the interrogation to observe and comment on its yield. The destruction of the CIA tapes for fear of public revelation ironically reveals how the will to secrecy can end up under- mining good security policy. Recent Amer- ican experience thus suggests that demo- cratic torture warps democracy insofar as it pushes the state into distorting and hiding its own action and also the content of the laws, sapping the value of publicity that is basic to ideals of democratic accountability. Torture, moreover, plays to one of the weaknesses of modern democracies: the dif- ficulty of sophisticated, historically in- formed debate in large, socioeconomically diverse nations. Wrestling with the evasive- ness of modern torture, Rejali contends that "the ability to create a common political space" is crucial to the recovery of factual truth against the tide of clean techniques.43 Tellingly, Lazreg also invokes and criticizes the "personal and political amnesic space oc- cupied by Algeria in the French collective psyche."44 The conclusion - that remember- ing matters, that history matters - is a banality. But it is a banality that modern democracies have an especially hard time honoring. Contemporary democracies are oriented toward the next election. They are sporadi- cally effective at resisting the dead hand of the past. American successes in overcoming (some) racial discrimination and (more) gen- der discrimination exemplifies this positive consequence of democracy. But arguably American democracy is also peculiarly mal- adapted to the task of remembering. In par- ticular, the processes of democratic cam- paigning in a large and variegated republic, in which rapid persuasion and glib retort are at a premium, are antithetical to honest re- membrance, especially when it comes to persons who stand on the periphery of democracy. Perhaps that explains why Jose Padilla s allegations of torture raised almost no con- cern: The federal judge to whom they were presented disregarded them as irrelevant to the question of his criminal guilt. No na- tional political figure has called for investi- gation. Even human rights groups have been relatively quiet, now that Padilla has been released from military detention and is thus no longer a poster child for the dangers of overweening executive power.45 It was, in the eyes of many, a history that was best for- gotten. So long as torture remains on the mar- gins, so long as it remains "clean," so long as it can be quickly consigned to history's dustbin, torture seems to persist - even thrive - in democracies. Neither the need for the legitimacy nor the force of public monitoring suffices to extinguish it. Torture and democracy stand in no sim- ple relation to each other. Their linkage is supple, subtle, and thick with ambiguity. To proclaim that America does not torture, that torture is inconsistent with democratic government is insufficient - and, especially in light of Rejali's work - now simply im- plausible. More certain, though, is the fact that democracies, including the United States, will continue to torture. And it also seems fair to predict that such practices will continue to corrode the fabric that makes democracy a possible, and a worthwhile, political project. • Notes 1. Rumsfeld v.
