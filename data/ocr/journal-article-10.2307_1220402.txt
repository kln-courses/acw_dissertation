<plain_text><page sequence="1">TAXON 25(I): 21-31. FEBRUARY 1976 CARL LINNAEUS AND THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF HORTICULTURE William T. Stearn* The impressive volume, Carl von Linnes Betydelse sasom Naturforskare och Liikare, published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1907 to com- memorate the 2ooth anniversary of the birth of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), amply and adequately sets forth his achievements as a physician, zoologist, botanist, geologist, and mineralogist, yet it says nothing about his horticultural interest. However, from his childhood gardening activities in the Stenbrohult rectory garden grew his later scientific achievements. Throughout his life, this interest was a source of mental refreshment and, together with his sensitivity to the beauty of the living world, underlaid his botanical success, as it did that of John Lindley (1799-I865), who was, in many respects, his x9th-century successor and the author of a much esteemed work on the theory and practice of horticulture. Linnaeus worked diligently and very efficiently with herbarium specimens, but he never lost his delight in living plants and their cultivation. Linnaeus' gardening activities have received comparatively little attention although, like virtually everything that can now be considered regarding Linnaeus, they have not been wholly neglected. Thus, in 1907, as part of the Linnaean bicentenary celebration, Magnus Bernhard Swederus (I840-I1911) edited and partly reprinted 14 papers and dissertations by Linnaeus published between 1739 and 1764 which have some horticultural relevance, under the title Linn6 och Viixt6dlingen [Soulsby 6202].1 On this occasion Swederus also published Linnes Vorlesungen liber die Cultur der Pflantzen, [Soulsby 3551]. The work reproduces a hitherto unpublished manuscript in German by Johann Gottlieb Georgi (1729-I802) based upon lessons on the cultivation of plants given in 1759 by Linnaeus to Clas Alstr6mer (1736-1794) and Frederic Logie (1739-1768). Together with H. O. Juel's Hortus Linnaeanus: an Enumeration of Plants cultivated in the Botanical Garden of Upsala during the Linnean Period (I919), [Soulsby 428], they testify to Linnaeus' knowledge and understanding of the practice and theory of horticulture. There are, however, yet other Linnaean publications likewise relevant, notably his Musa Cliffortiana florens Hartecampi 1736 (1736), [Soulsby 275], Hortus Cliffortianus (1738), [Soulsby 328], and Adonis Stenbrohultensis (a 1732 manu- script not published until i92o), [Soulsby 247, 381o]. Since the late Rachel Mc Masters Miller Hunt was as keenly interested in gardening as in i8th- century horticultural and botanical books, the present Linnaean Symposium, celebrating the acquisition of the extraordinarily comprehensive Birger Strandell collection of Linnaeana by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Pittsburgh, provides an appropriate opportunity to direct attention once more to Linnaeus' interest in horticulture. Linnaeus' Childhood in the Rectory Garden at Stenbrohult At a very early age, Carl Linnaeus acquired his love of gardening from his "" Department of Botany, British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, England. 1 Soulsby references are to the numbered entries in B. H. Soulsby, Catalogue of the Works of Linnaeus (and Publications more immediately relating thereto) preserved in the Libraries of the British Museum, 2nd ed. (London, I933). FEBRUARY 1976 21</page><page sequence="2">father, Pastor Nils Linnaeus (1674-1748), who, the year after becoming rector of Stenbrohult in Smaland, southern Sweden, developed a garden there; he moved from Rashult (where Carl was born in 1707) to Stenbrohult in 1708. Under his care, this rectory garden became one of the most richly stocked in the province of Smaland, indeed in Sweden as a whole. In 1732, at the age of 25, Carl Linnaeus made a list of its plants (Adonis Stenbrohultensis) which remained in manuscript until published in 192o by Felix Bryk in an edition limited to ioo copies. We learn from this that Linnaeus' father then grew at least 224 kinds of plants; unfortunately, part of the manuscript is missing. The names used are, of course, pre-Linnaean names, such as Borrago floribus coeruleis for Borago officinalis, Alkekengi officinarum for Physalis alkekengi, Anethum hortense for Anethum graveolens, but they can easily be equated with the binomials introduced by Linnaeus in 1753 and with current vernacular names. The garden which Nils Linnaeus created has been vividly described by Gotthard Virdestam in Svenska Linn6-Siillsk. Arsskr. 11: 18-I9 (1928), here quoted in Alan Blair's translation: He esteemed [writes Samuel Linnaeus, second son of Nils Linnaeus and Carl's younger brother] the smallest and most insignificant plant as highly as the fairest sweet-smelling flower, though such were not wanting either in the garden during his lifetime; he always wished for more species than he had. The garden therefore contained a rich variety of plants, which were useful or purely ornamental, as well as mere curiosities, which were probably cultivated in hot-beds or greenhouses. Of fruit and berries there were to be found several kinds of apples, pears, plums, cherries, gooseberries, currants, raspberries and strawberries. The kitchen garden doubtless made the vicarage kitchen the one best supplied with vegetables in Smaland; in the catalogue we find, amongst others, carrots, turnips, artichokes, beetroot, radishes, horse-radish, several kinds of cabbage, beans, peas and onions, asparagus, lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, pumpkins, parsley, dill, thyme, sweet marjoram, chervil, celery, mustard, and wormwood. Special rarities were mulberry-trees, small fig-trees, dwarf-almonds, grey hyssop and truffles, i.e. potatoes, also possibly one or two other plants with indications of foreign origin, such as Turkish wheat, Roman nettles and Lombardy nuts. No less numerous were the ornamental plants; they too were Linnaeus's especial favourites. Of these there were tulips and violets, daffodils and white narcissus, fritillaries and peonies, aconites, larkspurs and columbines, several kinds of lilies, carnations, poppies, lupins and roses, nasturtiums, marigolds and daisies, salvia and balm, southernwood and lavender, snowballs and jasmine, to say nothing of many others. It is easy to imagine a mid-summer's day in this garden as being a glorious experience, among the shady trees, the bright, sweet-smelling flowers, the hum of bees, the singing of birds and the cooing of doves... Such was the rectory garden by an inlet of Lake Mdicklen where the future director of the Uppsala botanic garden played among the flowers as a little boy. Many years later, Linnaeus wrote in his 1745 3Oland and Gotland journal: The garden which my father, the rector Nils Linnaeus, laid out here had more kinds of plants than any other garden in Smiland and this garden inflamed my mind from infancy onwards with an unquenchable love of plants. Nils Linnaeus much enjoyed working in his garden and, as soon as little Carl could toddle, he accompanied his father and wanted to help him, a pleasing desire of young children which they generally lose by the time they have grown big enough to be really useful. In February 1778, shortly after Carl's death, his brother Samuel wrote a long letter to Jonas Hallenberg, giving an account of Carl's childhood, which was obviously derived from his parents and thus preserved a family tradition. This is printed in Svenska Linne-Siillsk. Arsskr. 14: 116-120 (1931) and translated in Knut Hagberg, Carl Linnaeus, English trans- lation, 39-42 (1952). It complements Linnaeus' own less detailed autobiography (Vita Caroli Linnaei, 59, 91: I957): As soon as the child [Carl] could take the smallest notice, wrote Samuel, the father, who was inquisitive and dearly loved his little son, began to adorn the cradle with 22 TAXON VOLUME 25</page><page sequence="3">flowers, especially when he came in from the garden. The following year the father took his little son out with him, sometimes into the garden and sometimes into the meadow, often laying the child on the ground in the grass and leaving in its hand a flower to play with... The lad began to walk and this was father's greatest delight along with working in the garden. Carl saw his father's labour as of the greatest importance and soon began to wish to garden too. He was given one or two small beds to sow and weed and thus was born his great love for plants and trees. These beds were later changed for an allotment which was called Carl's garden. Then came the time when Carl must begin his studies. He had wits enough, but his mind was mostly on the garden. His mother would scold him for this, but the patient father always took his only son's part. Young Linnaeus constantly asked his father the names of plants and as fre- quently forgot them, until his father, in exasperation, sternly told him he would never be given any more names if he forgot them again. After that, according to Linnaeus himself, his heart and soul were set on remembering the names, "so that he might never lose his greatest pleasure". Linnaeus was then four or five years old. This remark is of great significance, for it indicates the beginning of that pre- occupation with the names of organisms which dominated Linnaeus' mind and which ultimately led to his reform of generic nomenclature and the introduction of consistent binomial nomenclature for species; together these have proved his most lasting contributions to biological methodology. In later life, as Loren Eiseley has said, "He was the naming genius par excellence; a new Adam in the world's great garden, drunk with the utter wonder of creation". The great pile of Linnaean systematic works, the Critica botanica, the Systema Naturae, the Species Plantarum and all the other works listed in Soulsby's catalogue, the Strandell Collection of Linnaeana at Pittsburg, as well as other collections in Uppsala, London, Leiden, Lawrence (Kansas), and elsewhere, all go back to this time when a little boy in an obscure Swedish rectory garden tried to please his father by memorizing plant names. Thus, young Linnaeus came to acquire a firsthand knowledge of plants and their cultivation and to interest himself in their naming. From this early horticultural grounding, while at school in Vaixjo and there principally through the influence of a local doctor, Johan Stensson Rothman (1684-1763), Linnaeus' interests spread into medicine and botany and turned away from theology, which his parents wished him to study so as to become a clergyman like his father and maternal grandfather. His decision to change from an ecclesiastical to a medical career, though sympathetically supported by his father, came as a grievous disappointment to his mother. According to Samuel Linnaeus, it was as bad as if he had changed his religion; it almost gave her a stroke. "Her only consolation was that she still had a son, Samuel, whom one should protect from the garden". Mrs. Linnaeus had indeed correctly diagnosed the cause of her elder son's apostacy: the garden at Stenbrohult. Samuel, one is happy to say, did not disappoint her. Ordained a clergyman, he followed his father as rector at Stenbrohult and became an authority on bee-keeping. In 1768 he published a little book on bees, Kort men tillf6rtlitig Bi-Skj6tsel, which, according to Hagberg, combines piety, theoretical fervor, and practical utilitarianism, as do indeed some of the works of his more distinguished elder brother. These characteristics can accordingly be regarded as an inheritance from the Stenbrohult manse and garden of Nils Linnaeus. The Sexuality of Plants In 1737, Linnaeus stated that in 1726 an experienced gardener, "Hortulanus gnarus N.L.," first raised Pepo (marrow) from seed in Sweden. As Felix Bryk (Linn6 als Sexualist, I5: I95i) has said the initials N.L. can only refer to his father, Nils Linnaeus. By this time, Rothman had acquainted young Linnaeus with the contents of Vaillant's Sermo de Structura Florum (1718), which deals with "the loves of the plants", emphasizing the sexual functions of the stamens (an- droecium) and pistil (gynoecium). FEBRUARY 1976 23</page><page sequence="4">The sudden revelation that sex comparable to that of human beings existed in plants had a profound and prurient effect upon young Linnaeus's imagination; hitherto bound within the puritanical conventions and traditions of the Swedish manse, he could now indulge in sexual phantasies by innocently studying flowers. Evidently this led him to note the two kinds of flowers produced by the cucurbitaceous plant in the Stenbrohult garden and to test their respective functions by removing daily the staminate flowers, in consequence of which the pistillate flowers produced no fruit. Thereafter, as he said, he examined a diversity of flowers on wild and cultivated plants, for "their singular structure and extraordinary function attracted my mind to enquire what Nature had hidden in them." To quote Alfred Noyes' The Torch-Bearers, So beautiful, bright and early He brushed away the dews He found the wicked wild-flowers All courting there in twos. Linnaeus' adolescent imagination sought human parallels. Comparing the stamens to husbands, the carpels to wives, the disc to a marriage bed, and the ray florets to harlots or concubines, he found in the sexual arrangements of plants an entertaining array of situations such as Polygamia superflua, Polygamia necessaria, etc. Gradually his so-called "sexual system" of classification took shape; basically it was a method of arranging genera into major groups (classes), such as Monandria, Diandria, Triandria, etc., according to the number of their stamens, and then into subgroups (orders), such as Monogynia, Digynia, Trigynia, etc., according to the number of stigmas; although arithmetical, it was made more interesting by Linnaeus' anthropomorphic metaphorical names and explanations (cf. Stearn, 1970). It became the most widely used general classification of plants and persisted well into the 19th century. The Uppsala Botanic Garden in 1729 From school at Vixj6i, Linnaeus, in 1727, entered the University of Lund, then transferred in 1728 to the University of Uppsala where he remained until his departure for Holland in 1735. The Uppsala botanic garden, founded by Olof Rudbeck the Elder about I655, had declined sadly after his death in 1702, following the disastrous Uppsala fire of that same year which destroyed so much of his life's work; Linnaeus found scarcely 200 kinds of plants growing in it. Nevertheless, they provided him with further material for study. In April 1729, an elderly clergyman entered the garden and, undoubtedly surprised to see a student actually studying, questioned Linnaeus about himself and about plants and then invited him home (having obviously noticed Linnaeus' poverty). This friend-in-need was Olof Celsius (i670-i756), a many-sided, very erudite, and much esteemed professor; he gave the probably starved-looking student a room in his house and let him eat at his table. Later that year, the head gardener at the Uppsala botanic garden died and Linnaeus, now 22, applied for the post, emphasizing his experience in horticulture gained at Stenbrohult and his botanical knowledge. His permanent appointment was opposed, seemingly on the reasonable ground that his evident abilities would be wasted as a gardener; instead, a very good practical gardener with 23 years of experience was appointed. Nevertheless, in 1730, Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1664-1742) obtained an appointment for Linnaeus as a demonstrator in the botanic garden; his duties consisted of lecturing to students on the names and virtues of medicinal plants. Clifford's Garden at Hartekamp Linnaeus' major opportunity to use and display his horticultural and botanical 24 TAXON VOLUME 25</page><page sequence="5">knowledge came in 1736 when, in Holland, he became house physician to the wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant-banker, George Clifford (i685-I760), and took charge of his richly stocked garden at Hartekamp near Haarlem. The overseas expansion of the British, Dutch, and French, the introduction of plants into Europe from their colonial possessions, and the sharing and exchange of these plants between botanic gardens such as those of Amsterdam, Chelsea, Leiden, and Paris had made an astonishing array of plants available in Holland. Clifford possessed most of them. His garden, with its beds of flowers, clipped alleys, and four large glasshouses, enraptured Linnaeus. In his Hortus Cliffortianus (1738), typographically the finest of Linnaeus' publications, he provided a permanent and scientifically important record of its plants, for which voucher specimens exist in the Clifford herbarium now at the British Museum (Natural History), London. Thanks to the erudition of Professor John L. Heller, Linnaeus' extensive Latin preface is now available in an English translation, published in Taxon 17: 663- 719 (1968), from which the following is cited: The fame of Your Garden, illustrious Clifford, [wrote Linnaeus] was on the lips of a few men, but less constantly than it deserved to be, and I was persuaded that Your Garden was only a Tantalus or Hesperides, such as cover almost the whole of the intensely cultivated land of Holland; I hardly considered it worth visiting, but the actuality surpassed all expectation. Do You remember the day when You were asking a foreigner, who was walking through the Amsterdam Garden, about a proper warden for a Flora? On the spot You were inviting him to your Garden, to visit your Floras. [When I went,] Dumbstruck I gazed. It pierced my heartstrings through, And still I gazed, and still my wonder grew. I gazed at Your garden in the very centre of Holland bright with flowers, between Haarlem and Leiden, a charming spot between the two thoroughfares, where boats, where carts pass by; my eyes were captivated by so many masterpieces of nature aided by art, shaded walks, topiary, statuary, fishponds, artfully contrived hills and Mazes.... Dumbstruck was I when I entered Your ADONIDES, houses filled with so many and such varied shrubs as to bewitch a son of Boreas, ignorant of the strange world into which you had led him. In the first house You nursed the flocks of southern Europe, and the plants of Spain, southern France, Italy, Sicily and the isles of Greece. In the second the treasures of Asia, such as [species of] Morina, Kaempfera, Camphorifera, Poinciana, Adenanthera, Costus, Garcinia, Phoenix, Coccus, Corypha, Nyctanthes, and so on. In the third, the plants of Africa, peculiar in their structure, not to say monstrous in their nature, like the widespread families of Mesembryanthemum and AloF, Stapelia, Crassula, Euphorbia, Protea, Maurocenia, Halleria, Cliffortia, Grewia, Hermannia, Royena, Clutia, and so forth. And in the fourth, the charming denizens of America and all that the new world produces, like the vast hordes of Cactus, Pereskia, Epidendron, Passiflora, Hernandia, Dioscorea, Magnolia, Liriodendrum, Benzoinifera, Sassafras, Brunsfelsia, Crescentia, Ammannia, Maranta, Martynia, Milleria, Parkinsonia, Pavia, Paullinia, Plumeria, Browallia, Randia, Turnera, Rivina, Tournefortia, Triumfetta, Heliocarpus, Hura, Aeschynomene, Cassia, Acacia, Tamarindus, Piper, Haematoxylum Guanabanus, Anacardium, Annona, Hymenea, Mancanilla, Monbin, Ahouai, Nassa, Papaja, Manihot, and so on. Disporting among these [I saw examples of] Musa, most remarkable in the Whole world, most Beautiful Hermannia, silvery Protea, costly Camphora. In Your own house, truly fit for a king, in Your magnificent Museum, the contents of Your Herbarium were opened to me, and in them a no less ample collection extolled the praise of its Owner and enthralled me, the stranger who had seen no such Garden previously. ... In the text of Hortus Cliffortianus, Linnaeus noted the provenance of each species, taking most of his information from John Ray's Historia Plantarum (1686-1704) but also using the works of J. Bauhin, Clusius, and Morison. Such information, he believed, had practical value. The native place lays the entire foundation for the cultivation of the plant. For if we have a considered record of the climate in each region according to the longitude and FEBRUARY 1976 25</page><page sequence="6">latitude of the place, if we have a record of the soil from the mineral kingdom and of the adjacent mountains and seas, we know more data about cultivation that are true, unambiguous and reliable than if the gardeners left us laws of cultivation for each and every plant. Linnaeus then went on to correlate the geographical distribution of plants and their treatment in gardens: a AFRICAN plants, indeed, though natives of a warm climate, endure the winters here quite easily, and are not easily killed if kept through the winter merely under a roof, without heat. Potted plants flourish with more difficulty, but those in free soil easily; provided only that the winters are not too severe or the land too low and damp, they thrive and flourish. When kept over winter in a heated greenhouse, if they are exposed to 70 degrees of heat, they grow mightily for a few months and luxuriate, but as the spring advances they are sure to die. All succulent plants from this region, like Mesembryan- themum, Euphorbia, Stapelia, Crassula, Kleinia, and also the Cactus of America, are all abstemious, especially through the winter, to such an extent that if one supplies them with too much water they are sure to perish therefrom. The African plants in this group do not like greenhouse heat beyond the 4oth degree, though the American plants do not reject the 7oth degree. /3 AMERICAN plants, those that are imported from southern America, for example from Surinam, Brazil, Peru, Jamaica, Martinica [Martinique], Bonaria [Buenos Aires], Domini- cana [Haiti], all of them when kept in a very warm greenhouse (up to the 7oth degree of heat) do not refuse to complete their annual cycle, and demand soil that has been well loosened and warmed with tan-bark; but those from northern America, for example Virginia, Carolina, Pensylvania, and so forth do not endure a very warm greenhouse and withstand much better both the open air and our winters. 7 ASIATIC plants are peculiar and some closer to European plants, especially those of Northern Asia, but those from Southern Asia or the India which we ought to call western, for example from Malabar or Ceylon, take hardly to our winters and prefer a warm greenhouse, though they thrive better below 5o degrees of heat. 6 SOUTH EUROPEAN plants, for example from Southern France, Italy, Spain, Sicily, Greece, and including Constantinople [Istanbul] too, easily endure the winters here, unless they are too severe, or if protected through the winter merely by a roof they gladly live alongside us. , ALPINE plans, however, require soil that is windswept and dry or elevated; they die during winter in a humid climate, but never from exposure to dry cold. Linnaeus and the Banana Linnaeus' main horticultural triumph while at Hartekamp was to flower and fruit the banana (Musa), which had long been grown there in vain, although earlier it had been flowered at Vienna, Karlsruhe, and Leipzig. He argued that, as it apparently came from tropical countries in which markedly different seasons alternated, it should respond to analogous treatment here. His method was accor- dingly to grow it in rich soil, keep it relatively dry for a period, then give it abundant water. This treatment succeeded. Its trunk reached the height of a human being and held aloft some nine, broad, equally long leaves from among which emerged a peduncle ending in a dense cluster of overlapping purple spathes and later yellowish fruits with yellow pulp. Familiarity with bananas imported in quantity from the Canary Islands, the West Indies, and elsewhere makes it difficult today to appreciate the horticultural sensation that this plant, once reputed to be the forbidden fruit of Paradise, formerly created. In Europe as a whole, they were virtually unknown well into the I9th century. Thus, a London diarist then recorded as especially worthy of comment that he "ate a banana for the first time, a kind of vegetable sausage tasting like marrow flavoured with pineapple". Victor Jacquemont reported from 26 TAXON VOLUME 25</page><page sequence="7">India in 1829 to his friends in France that bananas "resemble jasmine-scented pomade gone rancid and much sweetened". Linnaeus celebrated his success by publishing a small monograph, Musa Cliffortiana florens Hartecampi 1736 prope Harlemum (1736), [Soulsby 247], in which he discussed its names, system- atic position, characters, and uses, and illustrated it with two engraved plates by M. Hoffman. His pride found further expression in the engraved title page to the Hortus Cliffortianus (1738), where a banana plant towers in the background. A detailed article by Arvid Hj. Uggla on "Linn6 och bananen" is to be found in Svenska Linne-Siillsk. Arsskr. 42: 79-88 (I960). Linnaeus' Horticultural Principles In 1738, Linnaeus returned to Sweden from Holland and began to practice medicine in Stockholm, where, being unknown, he had difficulty at first in making a good living, but his patients soon included influential people. Thus, he came to the notice of the politician, Count Carl Gustaf Tessin (1695-1770), leader of the Hats party, and Captain MWrten Triewald (1691-1747), who was interested in forming a Royal Academy of Science to encourage the investigation of mathematics, natural history, economics, trade, useful arts, and manufacturing in Sweden. Linnaeus was one of five who met in 1739 to found the Academy, and he became its first President. The Academy's aims coincided with the mercantile outlook of the Hats party which dominated Swedish policy from 1739 to 1764. Its reports were to be in Swedish, whereas the transactions of the older Royal Scientific Society in Uppsala were in Latin. For his presidential address of 1739, entitled "R6n om wHxters plantering grundat pa Naturen" [Soulsby 343], Linnaeus chose a horticultural subject, "an attempt to base the cultivation of plants on Nature", in other words, to provide the scientific principles of horti- culture. Like his Critica botanica, the printed version of this address, published by the Academy in Volume i of its Handlingar in 1741, consists of numbered paragraphs comprising direct, concise, didactic, and emphatic statements, of which the following seven paragraphs give an abridgement. i. Linnaeus began with the observation that the uses to which one puts all kinds of plants, both native and exotic, in cookery, dyeing, and medicine, indicate how necessary is their cultivation; the plants in botanic gardens are also important for the instruction of students. The interest of gardeners, however, rarely extends beyond the usual kitchen garden plants and the best known flowers. Gardening books, including Miller's Dictionary (1731), are not wholly satisfactory; because most of them were written for countries other than Sweden, where laurels, rosemary, and figs must be protected against frost, because there are many plants they do not mention and because the basis of their information may be uncertain. Experiments and long experience are not to be despised, but can be bought at too high a cost. Hence, Linnaeus proposed to give advice which, if followed by a gardener, would rarely or never lead him astray. He limited himself to the kinds of gardens he called Adonis (i.e., a glasshouse where plants of a warm climate are grown in a colder one by means of artificial heat), and Paradisus (i.e., a botanic garden with all manner of plants), these being two of the types of gardens defined in his Bibliotheca botanica (1736), [Soulsby 250]. Among others were the Tantalus, the formal garden with clipped hedges, alleys, and walks; the Hesperis, the orangery for citrus fruits and other evergreens; and the Semiramis, with plants in pots and on walls. 2. Linnaeus then noted that guidance to the natural habitats of plants could be obtained from floras and from travel books, this having some importance because all our garden plants grow wild in one country or another and thrive and propagate without human aid. These wild-growing plants provide the key to their garden cultivation, because they are suited to the climate and the region where they occur, and they will thrive with us when we can give them similar conditions. By "climate" is to be understood the four "elements" from which all plants are given life: Earth (Soil), Fire (Heat), Air, and Water. The six main types of Earth, whether black, sticky, sandy, marly, decaying, or calcareous, all have their characteristic plants. FEBRUARY 1976 27</page><page sequence="8">3. Linnaeus next dealt with the effect of these four "elements" separately. Thus, the Air greatly controls the growth of plants and varies according to altitude as well as local conditions provided by hills, valleys, woods, bushes, etc. To be noted, however, is the shortness of the growing season where snow persists, as in the Alps and Pyrenees and in Lapland, which have species in common. When Tournefort ascended Mount Ararat, he found at the foot of the mountain the same plants that are widespread in Armenia; as he ascended, he found plants he had not seen since leaving France. Yet higher he found Erigeron acris, Cotoneaster integerrimus, Hieracium umbellatum, Senecio sylvaticus and Euphrasia officinalis, which are common in Sweden; above these were alpine plants such as occur in Switzerland and Lapland. The seaside air favors other plants such as Glaux maritima, sea-lavender (Limonium), Aster tripolium, Plantago maritima, and Triglochin maritimum. Mountains and hills, because of their meager and barren soil, strong winds, and quick drainage, have special plants, as have the roofs of houses. In such open places grow many plants such as Antennaria dioica, Crepis tectorum, Hieracium umbellatum, and Arnica montana. Valleys, on the other hand, nourish quite different plants, such as Maianthemum bifolium, Cornus suecica (Chamaepericlymenum suecicum), and Linum catharticum, while in woods with meager soil grow Linnaea borealis, Calluna vulgaris, and Monotropa hypopithys. Wastes, plains, and scrub likewise have their distinctive plants. 4. Water in its effect on plants is greatly modified by the three other "elements": for example, by Earth with its salt; Fire by conversion into rain or snow; Air by the effect of wind in making waves; hence, the peculiar plants of the seaside, marshes, springs, lakes, and snowy regions. 5. Degrees of heat (the "element" Fire) are very important because of their variation from zone to zone. Thus, plants of the zona calida cannot withstand any cold and must have a temperature of 5o' to 600 F. in winter; here belong plants from Surinam, Brazil, Peru, the West Indies, Amboina, Malabar, Ceylon, Egypt, and Arabia; among them are Hamelia alba, Carica papaya, Hura crepitans, Indigofera tinctoria, Hippomane mancinella, Crateva tapia, Phyllanthus epiphyllanthus, and Elephantopus scaber. The plants of the zona temperata subcalida require slight heat in winter from 30' to 40'; they belong to Spain, Sicily, Italy, Greece, Barbary, the Cape of Good Hope, southern Virginia, Japan, and southern China; they include Ficus carica, Laurus nobilis, and Clutia alaternoides. In the autumn of 1736, various plants from the Cape were housed in the warmest of Clifford's glasshouses where plants of the zona calida thrived, the temperature being 660 to 700. At first they grew unbelievably large, with shoots three times longer and twice as thick as usual, but they would not flower; then, after i1/2 months the leaves fell off one by one and the shoots died. These plants were Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Baccharis tenuifolia, Myrica quercifolia, and M. cordifolia. On the other hand, various Cape plants left in the open in 1737 survived until Spring, then died; these were Diosma hirsuta, Phylica ericoides, Myrsine africana, Celastrus pyracanthus, Anthospermum aethiopicum, and Myrica quercifolia. The plants of the zona subfrigida mostly rest the whole winter; in winter glasshouses they tolerate no heat above 38'; they survive the winter in Sweden without special care and come mostly from France, Germany, Russia, northern China, Japan, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Canada, and Tierra del Fuego. Among them are Betonica officinalis, Tamus communis, Lonicera periclymenum, Sarothamnus scoparius, and Digitalis purpurea. Plants of the zona frigidissima endure the strongest frost but must have no heat whatever in winter; here belong all the plants from the higher mountains. 6. The time of flowering is also determined by climate. At the Cape of Good Hope it is summer when it is winter in Europe. Thus, although by 1739 Haemanthus occineus had been in cultivation for 5o years, it still flowered in Sweden at Christmas, which is summertime in its native land. From this it follows that the cultivation of exotic plants should be based upon the conditions of soil, water, air, and warmth under which they grow in their native lands. 7. A good botanic garden should accordingly possess three glasshouses. The first, or hottest, for plants of the zona calida, must at all times have a temperature of 560 to 700. The second, for plants of the zona temperata subcalida, in winter must then have a 28 TAXON VOLUME 25</page><page sequence="9">temperature of 35' to 400. The third, or cool glasshouse, for plants of the zona subfrigida, needs no heat but is necessary merely to protect them against extreme cold. Thus, in 1739 Linnaeus built his science of horticulture upon phytogeography and ecology, for plant physiology in his day was too little advanced to provide guidance on the processes of growth and the treatment of plants in cultivation. Understanding clearly that the range of tolerance of conditions by wild-growing plants varies, but that each species has limits beyond which it cannot thrive or even survive, he related these physiological limitations to its area of natural distribution and its habitat; he then used such geographical and ecological information to indicate its cultural requirements. Virtually a century later, John Lindley published his The Theory of Horticulture (1840), in which he attempted to explain the principal operations of gardening upon physiological principles. Here Lindley remarked that, In the majority of works upon horticultural subjects, the numerous directions given in any particular ramification into which the art is susceptible of being divided, are held together by no bond of union.., like all empirical things, it is degraded into a code of peremptory precepts. His aim was accordingly "not to elucidate the laws of vegetable life in all their obscure details but to teach, to those acquainted with the art of gardening, what the principles are upon which their practice is founded". Thus, basically, the aims of Linnaeus and Lindley coincided, although Linnaeus' pioneer exposition is very superficial compared to Lindley's, and the latter in turn has long been outdated. Both works reflect their author's personalities as well as their times. Linnaeus' address of 1739 manifests the same approach and method of presentation as his other works; it has the same analytical division of a subject into comparable divisions, methodically arranged for practical purposes because he gave the fundamentals of gardening the same kind of attention as he did botany and zoology. In the background were his happy childhood days in the rectory garden of Nils Linnaeus at Stenbrohult. The Uppsala Botanic Garden, 1742-1778 In such a manner as above, Linnaeus summarized his general views on the theory and practice of horticulture based largely upon his observations of wild plants in Sweden and of cultivated plants in Holland, when staying with Clifford at Hartekamp. The opportunity to use them came in 1742 with his appointment as professor of botany at the University of Uppsala, with superintendence of the botanic garden. In 1739 the University had obtained the services of a very experienced German-born gardener, Dietrich Nietzel (1703-1750), lured through Linnaeus from Clifford's Hartekamp garden. Nietzel had previously worked in Germany, England, and Holland and was considered well worthy of contesting the palm with Philip Miller as being the most skillful gardener of his time (cf. Jackson, 1915). With his practical aid, Linnaeus made the restoration and im- provement of the garden a primary task. Henceforth, its progress is well- documented. In 1745 there appeared the Linnaean dissertation, Hortus Upsalien- sis... subj. S. Naucler, [Soulsby 1424], followed in 1748 by a volume of 300 pages, Hortus Upsaliensis, [Soulsby 424], enumerating all the plants then cul- tivated there. It testifies to the enthusiasm and success with which Linnaeus persuaded his many correspondents and students to provide the garden with plants and seeds. According to Th. M. Fries, seeds of 567 plants were sown in 1742; 500 in 1743; and more than i,ooo in 1744. Nietzel raised them on hot-beds. The resulting plants supplied Linnaeus with specimens not only for teaching but also for investigation and description. For the restored Uppsala garden, the Dutch governor at the Cape of Good Hope, Rijk Tulbagh, sent plants from South Africa; the Empress Catherine of Russia sent him seeds collected by German naturalists while exploring her vast realm; through the Swedish East India FEBRUARY 1976 29</page><page sequence="10">Company, Linnaeus received material from India and China; Pehr Kalm brought plants and seeds from North America; from the botanic gardens at Chelsea, Paris, Leiden, and elsewhere came yet others to enrich their Uppsala counterpart. Juel's Hortus Linnaeanus (i919) records 2,157 species as having been grown at Uppsala during the Linnaean period, and his list is far from complete. The actual number is probably very much greater, as there are no lists, only scattered notices, from 1753 onwards. Certainly many of the names published by Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum (1753), the dissertations collected in the Amoenitates Academicae (1749-1769), the Mantissa (1767, 1771), and the Supplementum Plantarum (1781), and other works, were based on living material grown at Uppsala. It was indeed through such widely used publications, which provided gardeners with con- venient binomial names for the species in cultivation, rather than through his teaching on horticulture, which reached only a few persons, that Linnaeus made his greatest and most lasting contribution to horticulture. Linnaeus and Lindley Botany owes much to those who, like Linnaeus, have come to it through an early training or deep initial interest in gardening. They include Philip Miller, the Wendland family, Louis Claude Richard, A. H. Haworth, John Smith, W. B. Hemsley, R. A. Rolfe, S. A. Skan, E. H. Wilson, Alfred Rehder, and John Hutchinson, but the most important of all were Linnaeus in the i8th century and John Lindley in the i9th. Their careers in some respects followed the same course. Both owed their interest in gardening to the enthusiasm of their fathers, and both in their youth diligently studied a variety of living plants. Later, both had charge of important gardens, Linnaeus at Hartekamp and Uppsala, Lindley at Chiswick and Chelsea. Both, from penurious youth, rose to be university professors. Moreover, their contributions to botany were somewhat alike. They were both prolific, didactic writers, playing an important part in the stabilization of botanical terminology, naming a vast number of new genera and species, instituting reforms of nomenclature, constructing systems of classification for the plant kingdom as a whole, and bequeathing to posterity many works of permanent value. Both toiled unceasingly at vast tasks and died exhausted by them, Linnaeus at 71, although his health broke at 69, and Lindley at 66. Being strong, independ- ent, egoistic individuals, they both rebelled in their youth against received authority, Linnaeus against the classification of Tournefort, and Lindley against the classification of Linnaeus. Much, however, of their busy lives was spent either in a garden or with a garden as the background of their multifarious activities, and when they discoursed on the theory and practice of horticulture, the foundation for both men was practical experience, acute observation, and absorbing interest ema- nating from a childhood among plants: Lindley in his father's nursey in Norfolk; Linnaeus in his father's rectory garden in Smaland. A little of the credit for their great achievements should accordingly go to those two now forgotten paternal gardeners, Nils Linnaeus and George Lindley, who tended the fertile soil from which these to grew.
