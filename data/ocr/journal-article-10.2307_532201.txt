The Editor welcomes contributions on these subjects from scientists and historians. 2 Submission of a paper by an author is taken as acceptance that the Editor's decision on the suitability of the paper for publication is final. 3 Submitted papers must be the author's own and original work, and must not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. 4 Contributions should normally not exceed 5000 words and may be shorter; relevant illustrations are welcome. Line drawings should be in waterproof black ink on fine board or tracing paper, and photographs for half-tone reproduction should be in the form of highly glazed prints. Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce artwork for which they do not hold copyright. 5 A descriptive title should head the paper, followed by the author's name and address. Honours and degrees are not shown, apart from F.R.S., F.B.A., F.R.Eng., etc. 6 A summary (maximum of 100 words) should be included under the title. It should be both concise and informative. Please provide six key index words. 7 Manuscripts should be word-processed in double-spacing on one side only of A4 pages, with a margin of about 3 cm on the left side and at the head of each sheet. They should be sent to: The Editor of Notes and Records, The Royal Society, 6 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y SAG. Where a paper is divided into sections, these should be described by short headings. Short quotations should be enclosed in single quotes; a longer passage should form a separate paragraph indented from the normal margin. Authors are advised to ensure that the text is easy to read for referees, and not to submit a draft-quality dot-matrix printout. After refereeing, The Royal Society would like final papers submitted on disk. We can use most WP formats on standard diskettes. 8 Notes should be typed separately from the main body of the manuscript. The Notes are printed at the end of each paper in numerical order, reference being made in the text by the use of superscript numbers. 9 Reference to books should include the author's name and initials, title (underlined for italics), then in brackets, town of origin and publisher (where appropriate for recent publications) and year of publication. Reference to papers in journals should include the author's name and initials, title of the paper, title of the journal (abbreviated according to common practice and underlined to indicate italics), volume number, the numbers of the first and last pages and the year of publication (in brackets). Examples are: 22 J.P. Muirhead, The origin and progress of the mechanical inventions of James Watt, vol. 2, p. 279 (London: Murray, 1854). 51 E. Darwin, 'An account of an artificial spring of water', Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 75, 1-7 (1785). 10 After a paper has been accepted, authors will receive a set of page proofs with a form quoting prices for extra offprints beyond those they receive gratis. Substantial changes in a paper at proof stage must be avoided.</page><page sequence="3">Notes and Records of The Royal Society of London Volume 54 Number 3 (2000) Contents Page The end of the Millennium by Sir Alan Cook, F.R.S. 273 The publications of John Pell, F.R.S.
