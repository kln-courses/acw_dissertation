<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATIONS THE SOCIAL ORIGINS OF THE GREEK DRAMA A recent important study of Greek drama by Professor George Thomson x represents the first serious attempt to apply a social interpre- tation to one of the major figures of this period and type of literature, Aeschylus. By implication, therefore, the book raises the entire problem of the social interpretation of all Greek literature and thought. It is the most stimulating of all recent studies devoted to the poets of Greece. It is packed with solid achievement. Its formulations are in many cases brilliantly incisive and illuminating. For these very reasons it challenges a careful statement of both agreements and dissents on the part of the reader. The earlier chapters of Thomson's book are, in general, the most satisfactory. They deal with Indo-European and Greek tribal organiza- tion and the survival of this traditional social form in literature. Here the author is basing himself on the anthropology of Morgan and Engels, and he demonstrates clearly the scientific fruitfulness of their approach. Using the results of Kretschmer's Einleitung zur Geschichte der griechis- chen Sprache, Thomson argues that the Indo-European terminology of kinship was originally classificatory, and he gives the evidence for this view in a long and carefully reasoned appendix. In the survey of later Greek society Thomson, following Morgan,2 illuminates such matters as the concept of tribal lottery, which in primitive times was concerned with food, then with booty, later with land, and finally as a survival with man's lot in life. He also shows the relations of this tradition to the Fates and the Furies and the whole later concept of necessity. The insti- tution of tribal initiation is traced through its modifications into literary uses: from magical incantations and ritual to the fertility play, the dithy- ramb, and finally into tragedy. The author is justified in his claim that he has vindicated Aristotle's account of the origin of tragedy and has resolved a contradiction which has baffled his predecessors. It is in dealing with the movements of the sixth and fifth centuries l Aeschylus and Athens: A Study in the Social Origins of the Drama (London: Law- rence and Wishart, 1941). In formulating this analysis I have been indebted to Mr. Tom Silverberg, who was good enough to discuss it with me. 2 In passing one must remark that it is a disservice to Morgan to make for him the false claim that "his argument led him to a remarkable prediction of the socialist revolution/' a claim explicitly denied by the American biographer of Morgan, Bern- hard J. Stern, in Lewis Henry Morgan: Social Evolutionist (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1931). *73</page><page sequence="2">274 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY B.C., however, that Thomson occasionally lapses into formalism, result- ing from an oversimplification of the sociological method. He makes the one-sided statement, for instance, that "ancient democracy was essen- tially the reassertion by the common people of their lost equality" (p. 43). This applies only to the formal aspects of the democratic movement, and neglects the differentiation of democratic ideals. The oligarchs likewise looked with nostalgic eyes on lost tribal patterns as, for example, the Pythagorean notion that justice was to be found in retribution: to anti peponthos, "an eye for an eye. . . ." Actually the democratic movement was much more than a sentimental quest for lost tribal equality. It was active, aggressive, and forward-looking. At its best it was militantly scientific. It waged a constant struggle with entrenched oligarchy on very concrete issues hinging on the distribution of property and the con- trol of political power. Underlying the whole struggle was a revolution in property relations. All this Thomson would, I think, admit. But to the extent that he regards the democratic struggle as a quest for a formal tribal equality then lost, to the extent that he tends also to counterpose abstract equality against abstract inequality and to make these the dynamic of social change, to this extent the picture of actual historical developments re- mains blurred. The evolution of the Achaean tribes into the Greek state, as described by Thomson, will further illustrate my point. In this process equality was gradually lost and the old military democracy of the tribe eventually destroyed. Thomson explains this by the rise of kingship within the tribes. Now it is true that kingship contributed to the destruction of tribal organization, but was not itself a cause of it. After all, the kings of Homeric society were only chieftains of the tribe; and to speak of "kings and vassals" who contract relations of fealty is a serious confusion with medieval feudal patterns. To be sure, the kingship was later asso- ciated with absolute economic superiority (primarily in the distribution of booty) and with extensive ownership of land. But it is only when the right of testamentary bequest became absolute, when property in land was allowed as an absolute right, when landowners banded together for mutual protection in the movement called synoikism, that we have the birth of the new institution, the city-state. In other words, this tendency to look to formal explanations for the origins of inequality leads Thom- son to put too early the historical qualitative leap which finally ter- minated gentile social organization. Formalism is quite clearly apparent in the author's analysis of Greek religion. He makes the anthropomorphic deities Zeus and Apollo into</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNICATIONS 275 state gods whose growing power eclipses the tribal Moirai. "The new gods have conquered," he says. "The tribe has been superseded by the state" (p. 54). In opposition to Thomson's argument we are convinced that even in the late tribal society of the Homeric poems the social dynamic is still the clash of clan against clan and federations of clans lined up one against the other. Likewise the Homeric gods are still tribal deities, although they reflect the rise of kingship and the growing need of federation among the clans. These same gods take on a new function later and preach a new ethic when the state begins to emerge. But the great age of Greek creative achievement was not ushered in until Greek society had been modified once more. The transformation was conditioned by the private possession of land, consolidation of power in the hands of the landowning nobles, the emancipation of commodity production from tribal patterns, and the consequent clash of landowner versus the dispossessed, later of the landowner versus the democratic coalition (merchants, poor peasants, and artisans). This provides the essential dynamic for classical Greek society and ushers in the great age of Greek creative achievement.3 One could cite other instances of unsatisfactory analysis due to lapses into formalism. Thomson claims that Anaximander's concept of dike (justice) as a clue to the cosmic process is expressed in terms of a feud or tribal vendetta between rival clans (p. 82). But the tribal system had already dissolved- as Thomson himself says- in the crucible of Ionian trade. As for adikia, which had by Anaximander's time come to mean injustice, it was not a tribal word at all; its implications were from the beginning dualistic and reflect the clash of social orders within a group, including the protest of the dispossessed. And so the formula of Anaxi- mander reflects not the vanished clash of clan against clan, but the con- temporary struggle of class against class. Another instance is the treatment of Heraclitus. This early dialec- tician, this philosopher of change and of the clash of opposites, is for Thomson a representative of "the aristocratic reaction to the popular movement" (p. 436 n.), stubbornly propounding a tribal ethic in the face of the mercantile revolution which was going on about him. Con- versely the Pythagoreans with their philosophy of harmony and subordi- 3 Thomson's misstatement of this important development is all the more strange since the meaning of the revolution which destroyed gentile society and ushered in the state had already been correctly characterized by Engels. Perhaps Thomson is here as elsewhere unconsciously affected in his thinking by the school of Durkheim, which included in its numbers the eminent scholars Jane Harrison and F. M. Corn- ford. Their sociological approach to English classical studies may be said to have rescued them from entire sterility.</page><page sequence="4">276 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY nation are transformed into democrats. "The tendency of aristocratic thought was to divide, to keep things apart"; conversely "the tendency of popular thought was to unite." 4 What Thomson is doing is trans- ferring the spirit of the modern proletarian movement, with its aspira- tions for a classless society, back to the early beginnings of a democratic movement in a very different set of social relations. Greek democracy, being based on slave labor which it regarded as permanent, could never look forward to a society based on harmony and an ethic of universal brotherhood^ and love. Hence the highest theoretical formulations of ancient democracy as well as those of the Ionians and early Athenian sophists necessarily reflected and included this struggle persisting be- cause of the conflicts within Greek democracy itself. What harmony meant for Greek antiquity is quite apparent in Plato's writings. Here the unified state is based on the submission of the "natur- ally inferior" to the "naturally superior," and is almost palpably an aristocratic ideal. Thomson admits the debt of Plato to the Pythagorean school; but for the sake of his argument he is forced to assume that some time in the fifth century that school underwent a mysterious change and was transformed into its opposite. For this abrupt and facile dialectic change there is no evidence whatsoever, as against abundant evidence that the Pythagoreans deprecated "anarchy," urged "harmony," and laid stress on the natural right of some few to rule. Thomson has in fact reversed the watchwords of the two contending factions. Tins' seems to stem in part from an anxiety to make Aeschylus at all costs a democrat. It can only be done by equating the fifth century democratic movement with the aspiration for the ordered unity of tribal life in which each man finds his tribal moira. It is further assumed that the Pythagorean notion of the moira is the same thing as the old tribal lot. The connection is however purely verbal. The moira of the Pytha- gorean is very different from the moira of tribal society. In a period when tribal equality had vanished irrevocably and when conflict had become the deepest social phenomenon, the Pythagoreans preached to poor and simple people a doctrine of contentment with their lot or their moira, which by now signified their fate rather than their equal share. The doctrine resembles the one embodied in the English catechism: "to do their duty in that state of life [moira] in which it had pleased God to call them." 4P. 156. Concrete evidence in refutation of this view would require more space than is available here. I can only refer the interested reader to Edwin Minar's un- published dissertation on Early Pythagorean Politics in Theory and Practice (Wisconsin, 1939)» for abundant evidence that the Pythagorean school played the rôle of the first of the oligarchical political clubs.</page><page sequence="5">COMMUNICATIONS 277 The same tendency to justify Aeschylus to the demos leads Thomson into some curious judgments of men and politics. Aeschylus was con- sistently anti-Persian. Therefore Thomson is obliged to show that any individuals or factions who worked with Persia were anti-democratic. And yet it is clear that the democratic leaders at the time of Marathon were more afraid of Miltiades, the leader of the aristocrats, and his Spartan orientation, than they were of Persia. Yet for the purposes of his argument Thomson makes opposition to Persia alone equivalent to a progressive position, presents the Alcmaeonidae, Pericles' own family and political predecessors, as reactionaries, and transforms Miltiades and his policy of accommodation with Sparta into a democratic tendency. Incidentally, any arguments which make Aeschylus into a democrat would apply as well to Cimon, the aristocratic leader and contemporary of Aeschylus. Thomson's treatment of Aeschylus' attitude to the reforms of Ephialtes is not altogether convincing. The court of the Areopagus had, of course, been the stronghold of the political power of the old Eupatrids, the land-holding oligarchy. The reforms of Ephialtes aimed at shearing off many of the court's powers, leaving it jurisdiction over homicide alone. In the Oresteaia Aeschylus is quite clearly taking some sort of attitude to the reforms of Ephialtes; but it is not at all clear that he is expressing approval. The production of the trilogy after the reforms does not in itself constitute approval of them. The strong emphasis on the Areopagus as the court for homicide cases might as well suggest that Aeschylus was affirming faith in the court and deprecating any further diminution of its power. There is so much agreement between Thomson and myself on basic questions that I have thought it important to dwell on points of differ- ence here, in the hope that discussion would lead to clarification. Among the topics on which I agree with him entirely is the treatment of the Dionysiac thiasoi (cult societies) and their relation to primitive rituals. Here the author conveys with great skill the sense of folk material evolving into a highly sophisticated form of art. His rehabilitation of Aristotle's account of the genesis of tragedy also seems sensible in the extreme, as does his chapter on "pity and fear." His account of the significance of peripateia, or reversal of fortune, makes good sense, and what he has to say on Euripides and Sophocles, though outside the main current of his theme, is distinctly thought-provoking.
