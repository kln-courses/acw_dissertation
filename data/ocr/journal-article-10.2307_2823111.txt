By Jacques Monod; translated by Austryn Wain- house. Knopf, New York. $6.95. 198 p. 1971.] In 1961, Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod pre- sented jointly two communications at the annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposium, that year en- titled Cellular Regulatory Mechanisms. One of their papers was on "The Regulation of Gene Activity," the other on "Teleonomic Mechanism in Cellular Metabolism, Growth, and Differentiation." The symposium volume appeared in 1962. In 1962, they gave a talk entitled "Genetic Repression, Allosteric Inhibition, and Cellular Differentiation" at the An- nual Symposium of the Society for the Study of Development and Growth; this symposium volume, on Cytodifferentiation and Molecular Synthesis, was published in 1963. In 1960, Andre Lwoff delivered a series of Compton Lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the subject of Biological Order. Lwoff's lectures were published in English, the language in which they were delivered, in 1962. They were addressed in the main to chemists and physicists in order to encourage an interest in bi- ology; they were on the whole expository, but no one with Lwoff's esprit, grace of presentation, and delicious irony can merely expound, and the author could not avoid revealing some of his beliefs. I cannot remember- although if I err, this may re- late to my own framework of thought in the early 1960's-that any of these talks or the books in which they were published received particular ac- claim in the public press. I divide my work each year between two institutions; the library of one of these institutions bought Lwoff's book, that of the other did not. It is true that, without comment, The Quarterly Review of Biology made the very exceptional move of publishing two consecutive re- views of Lwoff's book, one immediately following the other (1963, vol. 38, pp. 188-189). Both were eminently favorable. [The two reviews supplemented each other nicely, one being written from a typically biological point of view, the other from a more philosophical position. Ed.] In 1969 and 1970 Lwoff published in French a revised version of the M.I.T. lectures, and in 1971 Jacob and Monod each published a separate book; these are the books under review here. Le Monde devoted a full page to the books by Jacob and Monod in mid-November 1970, before their official dates of publication. The daily New York Times, in mid-March 1971, devoted a long news feature article to Monod's ideas as expressed in his book, and six weeks later another to Jean Rostand's ob- jections to them. The London Times Literary Sup- plement, which tends not to be wildly in love with science, published at the end of May 1971 a fairly extensive review of the books by Jacob and Monod. (None of these notices in Paris, London, or New York, by the way, mentioned that a related book had been written earlier and recently revised by Lwoff.) Le Monde reported in August 1971, in an article on best sellers in France during the first six months of the year, that over 250,000 copies of Le Hasard et La Necessite had been sold. What had happened within less than a decade so to alter public attitudes? DNA had been accepted, in private attitudes, as the hereditary substance well before the early 1960's, and so had the semiconser- vative manner of its replication. Nirenberg had begun to crack the code by the use of poly-U, and it was a matter only of time, not of principle, for its breaking-down to be completed. Substrate induc- tion, end-product repression, and even allostery antedated 1962. Well, a Nobel Prize had been di- vided between Jacob, Lwoff, and Monod in 1965, and Nobel Prizes bring rewards to publishers as well as to scientific pioneers. But also, meantime, all the laureates had been thinking, and so had a good many others. What had been at the beginning {403}</page><page sequence="2">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY a laboratory feat -and also a victory for the beau- tiful logic that characterizes the best of French thoought- had become a matter of public concern. These three books, as we shall see later, relate in differing measure to public concern. They all con- cern themselves most with molecules and their place in biological systems, and only to varying degrees with man and his place in the cosmic system. But insofar as they do take up, if and when they do, problems of society, they are themselves essentially books of private concern. They will be relevant only to those who believe that human action presupposes thought, and who hold that the thought and action of impatient today are as inseparable from those of yesterday as they will become from those of tomor- row. All these books address themselves in one way or another not to a new question but to one of the oldest of all: what is life? What is man, that thou art mindful of him? asked David in a Psalm. Each author defines life in slightly, but not very, different terms. For Lwoff, it can be considered "as a property, or indeed as a manifestation, or again as a condition of organisms" (pp. 14-15). What is an organism to him? A complex and organized sys- tem that metabolizes, grows, and reproduces in an orderly fashion. Order is the key word in his title, and in his thought. His organism contains macro- molecules, and as a complex of macromolecules has been defined as "an independent unity of integrated structures and functions capable of giving rise to an identical complex" (p. 16). "[It] is a system of active and disciplined molecules. Each works for all, and the organism is but an ensemble of molecules whose activity and synthesis are regulated and coordinated" (p. 111). [These last two sentences, italicized by me, are not found in the original English edition, but have been added to the French one.] According to Jacob's view, an organism today seems to be "the seat of a triple flux of matter, energy, and information" (p. 109). "It represents . . .the execution of a design, but a design which no intelligence has conceived. It tends towards a goal, but a goal that no mind has selected. This goal is to prepare an identical program for the next generation. It is to reproduce itself. An organism is never anything but a transition, a stage between what has been and what will be" (p. 10). His organ- ism has not a single organization but sets of organi- zations enclosed one within another. "It is . . . by a combination of elements more and more elaborate, by an articulation of structures subordinate to one another, that the complexity of living structures comes about. And if in each generation these sys- tems can reproduce themselves from their elements, it is because at each level the intermediary structure is thermodynamically stable. Thus living beings are constructed by a series of encasements. They are arranged according to a hierarchy of discon- tinuous ensembles. At each level units of fairly definite size and of almost identical structure unite to form a unit of the next echelon. Each of these units constituted by the integration of sub-units can be designated by the general term integron. An integron is formed by the assembly of integrons of a lower level; it participates in the construction of an integron of a higher level" (p. 323). Biological integration implies to me something infinitely less static than encasement, with thermodynamic sta- bility forming the boundary between casings. But then, I have not won a Nobel Prize, and Jacob is not the only biologist to be using such analogies at the present time. Jacob's Russian dolls are Grob- stein's Chinese boxes. Monod conceives of organisms as systems com- bining three distinctive properties: teleonomy, au- tonomous morphogenesis, and reproductive invari- ance. Monod's organisms, as do Jacob's, proceed towards an end: the end is invariant reproduction. One of the outstanding features of Monod's argu- ments is his emphasis on proteins as the molecular agents of structural and functional teleonomy. He goes beyond those who view the importance of pro- teins in terms of their enzymatic activity respon- sible for the regulation of metabolism. He attributes the epigenetic development of the organism to what he calls the cognitive properties of proteins, con- ferred upon them by their capacities to form stereo- specific noncovalent bonds, and to undergo such interactions at all levels, from those involved in the formation of oligomeres from protomeres, all the way to those responsible for the production of morphogenetic fields and gradients. To a develop- mental biologist as a specialist thinking in terms of his own discipline, Monod's chapter on molecular ontogenesis is the most exciting in his book. To the developmental or any other biologist as a generalist, perhaps the focal chapter is that in which the chance and the necessity of the title are discussed in terms of evolution: chance in the production of mutation, necessity in the action of natural selection. "Many distinguished minds," writes Monod, "seem even today not to be able to accept, or even to understand, that from a single source of noise - from one only - selection has been able to draw out all the musics of the bio- sphere. Selection operates . . . on the products of chance, and cannot maintain itself otherwise; but it operates within a domain of rigorous exigencies from which chance is banished. It is from these exigencies, and not from chance, that evolution has developed its usually ascending orientations, its successful conquests, the orderly burgeoning that it {404}</page><page sequence="3">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS * 1966-1975 seems to represent" (p. 135). Our authors, as thinkers as well as organisms, are themselves bound by certain historical and scien- tific exigencies. They all necessarily concern them- selves with order and with the second law of thermodynamics; law and order are not opprobrious topics for theoreticians of biology. They all must answer to the laws of statistical mechanics, and they all frame their concepts under the influence of information theory and cybernetics. Nonetheless the three books differ in their treatments of their theme, and by so doing they provide necessary supplements to each other. The Lwoff lectures, now published in French for the second time (the first French edition, issued in Paris by Robert Laffont in the Collection Jeune Science, carried the copyright date 1969), have been brought up to date, and are, as we have already said, mainly expository; they were not designed to be philosophical. They propound the factual basis of molecular biology, and describe lucidly, in a well- illustrated text, the experiments by which it was established. Jacob and Monod are less concerned with presenting the detailed procedures and pro- cesses of molecular biology. They do not take for granted that their readers know them, but they summarize them deliberately only in general terms and in principle, sufficiently for their readers to follow their arguments. General readers, to appre- ciate to the maximum the thought of Jacob and of Monod, might well first remind themselves of some experimental details by reading - or re-reading as the case may be - Lwoff's lectures. The French version contains only a few differences from the earlier English edition, but these are the essential ones to make the book valid for readers of the 1970's. In addition to providing necessary minimal backgrounds for the understanding of molecular biology, Lwoff also takes up in some detail a num- ber of topics that are less important to the other authors: some aspects of virus and phage studies, lysogeny, cancer and so forth. It is to be hoped that the new edition will again be issued in English; such is the pace of history that it can now be warmly recommended to the M.I.T. Press as an appropriate volume for its series of Paperbacks in the History of Science and Technology. Jacob's ploy has been to develop his theory of integrons within integrons by demonstrating how the thinkers of the past and present have analyzed each successive level of organization as it has emerged to become open to study. As his subtitle indicates, the study of heredity is his primary in- terest, but he has chosen to write this special history in relationship to a more general -history of bio- logical thought from the 16th century to the present. As a historian, Jacob is extremely erudite, and as a thinker he is as logical. But in addition, he is highly original, and has taken a very fresh view of the history of biology. Visible structure, organiza- tion (in terms of organs and organ-systems), time, and finally genes, molecules, and integrons are the successive subjects of his disquisition. They are all treated with great imagination; the chapter on the importance to biological thought of the introduc- tion into it of the parameter of time is perhaps the most provocative. It is not quite clear why it should be so surprising that a Nobel Prize winner in medicine should be able to write as fine a history of biology as has ever been written by any one else, historian or biologist. But surprising it is, in part perhaps because La Logique du Vivant contains so much wisdom as well as so mjuch knowledge; it is more than impressive that within what has so far been a short life, a single mind can have stretched so widely and penetrated so deeply. Jacob could be, on the basis of this book, a serious candidate for a Nobel Prize in history were there one to contend for. If we were to award a non-existent Nobel Prize in the history of science to Jacob, we might consider offering its counterpart in logic to Monod. As his subtitle shows, he has composed a philosophy of biology. It is tightly conceived and tersely ex- pressed, and because of the requirements of molecu- lar biology it supersedes earlier philosophies. Monod begins by defining organisms in the terms we have already specified, and then points out fallacies in earlier biological philosophies. He is equally criti- cal of metaphysical vitalists such as Bergson and of their scientific counterparts such as Elsasser and Polanyi. He is even harder (one is relieved to find) on Teilhard de Chardin for his uncertain logic and his lack of rigor; and he is severe in pointing out the epistemological weaknesses of dialectical ma- terialism. Thus his own thought, as he views it, makes a break with the past and proceeds from the new basis provided by molecular biology. The old teleologies, to which we shall return briefly below, are supplanted by a teleonomy whose agents are those proteins we have already discussed. After taking up their roles in regulation and in morpho- genesis, he proceeds to his discussion of evolution in the widest sense, and then he crosses new fron- tiers: teleonomy in behavior, the higher functions of the nervous system, the origin of man and of his knowledge and of his values are all explored. For Monod, ethics follows from the molecules: the possibilities of ethical choice have grown out of a knowledge produced by a brain that has evolved as a result of chancey concourses of molecules. Selec- tion has evolved a knowledge that has open to it the option of selecting its own values. So nigh is {405}</page><page sequence="4">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY grandeur to our dust. Yet Monod himself is a frank Cartesian, and there are puzzles here that are unresolved. Although Monod's book is much shorter than Jacob's, it takes much longer to read, since each sentence requires deep and concentrated thought to appreciate. Monod expresses himself throughout in language that has great power, and no one who reads this book carefully and who follows its thought will ever be able to free himself completely from the influence of its logic and its objectivity. Of the three authors, Monod considers at greatest length in the privacy of his mind the public prob- lems of modern man and modern society. Lwoff, in the passage where he describes the organism as a system of disciplined molecules, after the two sen- tences that we have already quoted, adds another that is also new in the French edition: "All is for the best in the best of worlds . . . the bacterial one" (p. 111), but in a new preface added to the French edition he states: "There is, apparently, nothing in common in a molecular society and a human society. Nonetheless we cannot always escape being struck by a certain analogy between the phylogenetic evolution of organisms and the his- torical evolution of societies" (p. 7). Jacob, in his chapter on the integron, includes the affairs of man in his scheme of over-all organization: "From family organization to the modern State, from ethnics to the coalition of nations, a whole series of integra- tions is based on a variety of cultural, moral, social, political, religious and other codes. The history of man is a bit that of these integrons, of their forma- tions, of their changes. . . . The variation of socie- ties and of cultures rests on an evolution comparable to that of species" (pp. 341-342). The analogy be- tween the organism and society is at least as old as Plato's The Republic; it is one which, I believe, would appeal more to me if I were a member of a hymenopteran, rather than a human, society. And how do the boundaries between these inte- grons relate to thermodynamic stability? Monod has steered clear of explicit analogy between the orga- nism and human society. Lwoff's reference to the analogy between organism and society is, as we have said, not in his main text. Jacob and Monod both express in the main body of their texts their concern for the problems of man. One feels, however, in reading what they have to say, that they speak of these with less authority than when they speak of molecules, and organims, and even populations of organisms. The important thing is that they care. Perhaps this is the basis of the difference that we pointed out between the 1960's and the 1970's. If concern for the relationships of the organism to society reaches back to the days of Plato, pre- occupation with teleonomy extends at least as far back as the time of Aristotle. For him, the Final Cause is "that for the sake of which the thing exists, considered as its End [telos]" (De Genera- tione Animalium 715a4); "that which we call the Final Cause [is] that for the sake of which the thing is formed" (De Partibus Animalium 639bl5). For Aristotle telos was simply the end toward which a process is directed, and a formative process at that. The idea that reproduction of itself is the end for which an organism is destined is not incompatible with the teleology of Aristotle himself, which was far less anthropomorphic than that of his followers. When Jacob tells us that in the past, a biologist found himself in the presence of teleology as beside a woman he could not do without, but in whose company he did not wish to be seen in public (p. 17), he is no doubt thinking of later teleologists than Aristotle. In any event, he concludes that the con- cept of programmed information legalizes the liai- son. This concept is also at the basis of Monod's teleonomy. If the new concepts developed by Lwoff, Jacob, and Monod permit a new liaison with a new tele- onomy, they force, according to Monod, a new rup- ture with the old animism that he sees as having pervaded the earlier philosophies of biology, of history, and of politics of which he is so critical in the second chapter of Le Hasard et la Necessite. Yet one of the curiosities of all these three books is the degree of anthropomorphism which informs their terminology. Lwoff's molecules are disciplined; Monod's proteins as agents of teleonomy have cog- nitive functions; Jacob writes of "series of transfor- mations . . . [by which] the bacterial cell finds the means to use the energy that it extracts from the medium" (p. 290). These words that I have itali- cized are loaded words. Some of them and of their ilk are no doubt chosen with deliberate wit, but others perhaps because there are no better ones that have been framed by a brain that cannot help be anthropomorphic since it is a brain of man. They may suggest that not even the best of us have completely broken the ties to earlier fallacies -if indeed it is a fallacy that man should think anthropomorphically. These three writers are the best of us, in many ways, in their private thought and their public responsibility, and these three books deserve atten- tion. Reading them near the time of their writing provides some compensation to us for some of the miseries and despair of living during the days when they are new. {406}</page></plain_text>
