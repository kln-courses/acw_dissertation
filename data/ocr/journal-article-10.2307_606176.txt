Finally, they also provide the basic data for the development of a clinical reference tool. The shortcoming of incomplete text-critical analysis of the entire text is far outweighed by the huge amount of data in the translations, precise presentation of the data in the Blue Beryl, and introductory essays. The English transla- tions in the text are clear and understandable, and convey the meaning of the Tibetan. This project also lays a solid founda- tion for further research in diagnostic methodologies, prepara- tion of medicines, and comparative analysis of medical theory and ethics.2 The bibliography and annotated scholarly analyses provide ample resources for further investigation. Any short- comings of this effort are insignificant in relation to the benefits of this pioneering work in the field of Tibetan medicine. PAUL NIETUPSKI JOHN CARROLL UNIVERSITY 1 Cf. K.

Meditation Differently: Phenomenological-psychological As- pects of Tibetan Buddhist (Mahamudra and sNying-thig) Practices from Original Tibetan Sources. By HERBERT GUENTHER. Delhi: MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, 1992. Pp. xvi + 210. Rs 135. This book contains seven chapters, and half is devoted to the seventh: the translation of a work with the abbreviated title, "The Sun's Life-Giving Force," composed by rTse-le rGod- tshangs-pa sNa-tshogs-rang-grol (sixteenth century). The Ti- betan title is not provided. The first six chapters are the trans- lator's introduction. The author, rGod-tshangs-pa, attempts to reconcile two systems of praxis, the Mahamudra and the rDzogs-chen, associated primarily with two schools: the bKa'- brgyud and the rNying-ma. He expounds them in the traditional framework of "ground, path, and goal." His emphasis upon the middle term justifies "meditation" in the book title, although the philosophic underpinnings are kept visible throughout. The translator's qualifier "differently" must be intended to denigrate other, unmentioned schools; and the grammar of the "medita- tion differently" demonstrates his inveterate creativity. A derivative purpose of the author, who belongs to the rNying-ma school, is to authenticate the rDzogs-chen system by demonstrating its consistency with Mahamudra, whose Indian provenance is not doubted. rDzogs-chen texts and their "tantra" sources were excluded from most editions of the Tibetan canon of translated scripture, and for good reason: even as rGod- tshangs-pa presents them, for example, they demonstrate a pre- occupation with cosmogonic beginnings that is not typical of Indian Buddhism. The translated text does indeed present the experience of meditation in unusual ways. Important topics include (p. 131) the role of inspection (dran pa, smrti)-whether it entangles the mind or facilitates liberation; the relationship of the two systems to supreme yoga-tantra (pp. 135ff.) and its psycho-physiology (138ff.); and the effects of the "lighting up" experience (p. 150) on behavior in the world-in a word, non-activity. Still farther along the path (pp. 153ff.), the bodhisattva's wisdom and pow- ers are presented from the point of view of the bodhisattva's mind, not-as in most other texts-by observation from out- side. Even the dreams of bodhisattvas are described. Because the rDzogs-chen has been studied less than the sys- tems of other schools, the value of bringing this text to light is all the greater. However, the dearth of alternative renderings makes it difficult to assess the translator's interpretations. The bibliography contains numerous Tibetan sources but no study or translation by any contemporary buddhist or buddhologist, aside from the translator himself. There is no question of Pro- fessor Guenther's high level of linguistic competence; the fol- lowing issues are raised in the spirit of inquiry. The term "Being," drawn from Heidegger, leaps out of the text. The translator has responded in previous works to the suggestion that it wrongly imputes to rDzogs-chen thought a quasi-substantialism. The term translates gzhi, more com- monly translated as "ground." In the text by rGod-tshangs-pa, gzhi is rendered initially as "basis" (p. 96), then as "Being" (pp. 97ff.). This "Being" (in parentheses, p. 97), is imputed with "overall purposing"-a development that seems to stretch past substantialism to anthropomorphism. A substantialist interpretation may be justified by this very work of rGod-tshangs-pa, who relates (and deflects) a Mahamudra criticism of rDzogs-chen as sub- stantialist for its treatment of gzhi (here translated as "ulti- mate stuff," p. 130). However, it seems doubtful that gzhi is as prominent in the rDzogs-chen system as it is in the translator's. In a passage of chapter three (p. 28) translated from the mKha'-yang of kLong-chen Rab-'byams-pa, the term "Being" appears six times (twice it is placed within parentheses) whereas it does not appear at all in the original Tibetan. This instance could be multiplied. In numerous places besides, abstract nouns are created where they do not appear to be warranted by the Tibetan text. Restricting our examination to the translation proper, the phrase ka dag pa (p. 101), generally understood to mean "pure 653</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) from the beginning" and here a modifier to "pri ness," is translated "diaphaneity."

Here also, it should be borne in mind that rDzc thors have themselves come under attack by ot scholars for imprecise reification.

The criticism, though, is getting choanalysts. This book is an attempt to reclain ground by arguing that while "there is no longer th cern with establishing psychoanalysis as a science 1 See, for example, Adolf Grunbaum, Valida Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (Madison: I Universities Press, 1993). stine aware- tivist sense," and "psychoanalytic theory cannot be proven by term gnas- experimental means" (p. 64), it still has a role in the area of the her than the explanation of religious phenomena, for example, the Hindu mystic and the guru. ogs-chen au- Kakar begins by explaining that the kind of psychoanalysis ther Tibetan he advocates is that practiced by "relational" analysts such as re are other Winnicott and Kohut, and American ego psychologists, a form clearly seen which takes a much more sympathetic view of religion than h contempo- does classical Freudian (reductionist) analysis.

He genuinely seeks to explain and understand, Guenther- rather than to reduce and explain away. It is here that he dis- nary ignora- plays his great talent for explaining things Indian clearly and &gt;r corrobora- simply, without misleading oversimplification, a talent Kakar of potential exhibits in all his books. Readers unfamiliar with Hinduism g to the size will warm to Kakar's clear exposition, and those who are )n drawn di- familiar will envy his facility. Ramakrishna, "an outrageous ire accorded figure to unsympathetic and prosaic observers" (p. 18), is ex- lless to say, plained in terms of contemporary Hindu beliefs and practices as much as psychoanalytic ones. And the guru-sisya (master- ) the author, disciple) relationship, a feature of Hindu practice often misun- ication data. derstood in the West, is similarly analyzed so that the positive, iages. healing aspects of the relationship are made clear. Here Kakar is on familiar ground, similar to that covered in his earlier Sha- MARK TATZ mans, Mystics, and Doctors,2 where he also attempts to explain some forms of healing characteristic of the Indian scene but un- familiar in the West. It is a little surprising then to find the third chapter, his ap- ologia for psychoanalysis as a tool for religious explanation, to be so defensive and pleading. And so unconvincing. One would have thought that he would have rested his case on the flections on evidence of the previous two chapters. The trouble with this is licago: UNI- that the explanation in those chapters does not rely for its va- lidity solely on the truth of psychoanalysis, and the reader can find them illuminating and insightful without sharing the au- taing de a l thor's psychoanalytic beliefs. It is almost at times as if the au- fair deal of thor realizes the battle is already lost, and he seems in the end rather to use the mystic and guru/healer to explain the psycho- analyst (p. 63). Analysis is in the end a "soul physics" which e same con- e same con- can "contentedly exist in the boundary space between science in the pOSi- and art and religion without feeling the need to accede to any one of them" (p. 64).
