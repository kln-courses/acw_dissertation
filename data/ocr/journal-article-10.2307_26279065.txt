<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONRAD'S VIEW OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES IN LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS John E. Saveson Between conrad's first two novels and Lord Jim exists not only a difference in literary quality but also a change in Conrad's moral assumptions. The moral perspective of Almayefs Folly and Outcast of the Islands is uncomplicated: in Lord Jim it is ambivalent and, per haps, ambiguous. For this reason, Conrad's remark in a letter of November 21, 1896, has special force: "Gone are, alas! those fine days of Aim: Folly when I wrote with the serene audacity of an unsophisti cated fool. I am getting more sophisticated from day to day."1 At the time of this letter, before Conrad began to collaborate with Ford Madox Ford, Conrad's chief guide to sophistication in an intellectual and moral sense must have been H. G. Wells, whom Conrad had sought out after discovering that Wells was the author of an unfavor able Saturday Review article on Outcast of the Islands.2 Comments by both men leave an impression that subsequently Wells was vir tually a gauleiter.3 Although there is no record of the exchange of 1 G. Jean-Aubry, Joseph Conrad: Life and Letters (Garden City, 1927), I, 196. '1*1, 1, 189-190. 'Conrad's correspondence with Wells between 1896 and 1904 indicates that Conrad read almost everything Wells wrote in that period, both fiction and intellectual texts. That Wells continued his criticism of Conrad's prose after Wells' Saturday Review article is made clear in the following passage from a letter Conrad wrote on September 6, 1898: "I have lived on terms of dose intimacy with you, referring to you many a page of my work, scrutinizing many sentences by the light of your criticism. You are responsible for many sheets torn up and also for those that remained untorn and presently meeting your eye have given me the reward of your generous appreciation" (L &amp; L, I, 248). Ford recounts that his collaboration with Conrad alarmed Wells to the point that Wells paid a special visit in order to plead with him not to spoil that "wonderful Oriental style." "It's as delicate as clockwork and you'll only ruin it by sticking your fingers in it" (Joseph Conrad: A Personal Remembrance [Boston, 1924], p. 48). Wells' sense of pro prietorship is marked. Marlow as a narrator first appears in Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim, works written about 1900 when Conrad and Wells were on the friendliest terms. In a remark quoted by Ford, Henry James likens Marlow to Wells—with all the implications the comparison has for philosophical attitudes in works in which Marlow appears: "The intellectuals took up with Wells for a time. There crept into Wells' work a note of exasperation at the futility of human life. In this connection Henry James said Wells might be 'your friend Conrad's monstrous master marineT, Marlow addressing to the moon his hyperslav complaints at the lugubrious ends attending on human behavior" " (Mightier than the Sword [London, 19S8], p. 151). Finally, it is apparent in Conrad's letters that Wells recommended authors to him. On October SO, 190S, for example, Conrad wrote: "Don't forget to send me Metchnikov's book. I am really curious to see that." The volume referred to, doubtless, was the Études sur la nature humaine, published in Paris earlier that year (See L ir L, I, 321). 163</page><page sequence="2">ideas in that relationship, the fact of the relationship is useful. A test of the probability of large inferences taken from the changing moral assumptions of Conrad's first three novels is, logically, the fact of the Conrad-Wells relationship. If Conrad seems to have been influenced by a certain intellectual text or intellectual movement, is it one Wells knew? This study concerns itself with one altered attitude, namely, what appears to be in Lord, Jim a changed estimate of the psychology and morality of primitive peoples. This changed estimate, when referred to appropriate sources, implies a certain evolution of Conrad as a moralist. Lord Jim has traces of the Spencerian hierarchy found in Almayefs Folly. The Rajah and his minister, avaricious, cunning, resemble Lakamba and Babalatchi; but there are no descriptive passages in which can be read direct reflections of Spencerian analysis. Spencer ian terms are rare, although two characters, Jim's retainer and a half caste are limned rather obviously with help from contemporary Spen cerian-influenced anthropological writings. Tamb Itam has two notable traits: a primitive fidelity and a talismanic awe toward Jim. Of Tamb Itam's reaction to the final events of Jim's life in Patusan, Marlow observes: "Of the faithful servant, uncomprehending as the rest of them, it is the fidelity alone that comes into play; a fidelity and a belief in his lord so strong that even amazement is subdued to a sort of saddened acceptance of a mysterious failure." Tamb Itam's loyalty conveys in this context the anthropological truism that primitive forms of autocracy are natural to barbaric societies.4 Second ly, at the end of the novel, Tamb Itam's "surliness, too, was subdued into puzzled humility, as though he had seen the failure of a potent charm in a supreme moment" (p. 435). The talismanic, also, had learned connotations. William Edward Hartpole Lecky, a cultural historian referred to by almost all late nineteenth-century writers on evolution, lists these stages in the development of the higher forms of religion: (1) primitive belief in Spirits and the continued existence of the dead, (2) fetishism, in which magical properties are assigned to objects, (3) anthropomorphism, (4) abstract spiritual concepts.® Not only Tamb Itam but also Mrs. Almayer and the hero of "Karain" are characterized by reference to this or some similar list. Mrs. Almayer's mind spreads itself exactly over Lecky's first two categories. She be 4 Cf.

She imagines that if she loses it, she will be tormented by Djinns. Similarly Karain has an irra tional fear of the dead, which is dispelled when his European friends give him a talisman, a coin bearing the likeness of Victoria. Conrad's rendering of these aspects of the native mind has a sophistication above that of the casual observer, a fact nowhere more evident than in Lord Jim, where in sketching out a very minor character Conrad relies almost entirely upon the suggestiveness of anthropological terms and concepts. The half-caste mentioned above is a more minor figure even than Tamb Itam—a clerk to whom Marlow refers as he recounts the dressing down given the Captain of the Patna by the Master Attend ant of an Eastern port. Marlow's summation of the skinny-necked, timid, and servile "Portugese" is the usual anthropological generaliza tion concerning the mixture of savage and civilized: "The race—the two races rather—and the climate."6 It may be thought that the absence in Lord Jim of the exact grada tions and the full psychological analysis which establish a Spencerian hierarchy of characters in Almayer's Folly results from the foreshorten ing of the later novel, its extreme focus upon its hero; but the characterization of Dain Waris, Jim's "war comrade," as Stein might have called him—the natives say that he fights like a European— argues otherwise. Marlow says that he has a "European" mind: "You meet them sometimes like that, and are surprised to discover un expectedly a familiar train of thought, an unobscured vision, a tena city of purpose, a touch of altruism" (pp. 322-3). The passage is the obverse of usual anthropological descriptions: intelligence clouded by superstition, instability of thought and action, self-interest affected un certainly by communal interests.7 Assigning European stature to a native cannot happen in Outcast of the Islands and Almayer's Folly. There the Spencerian distinction •Lord Jim, pp. 44-45. In An Outcast of the Islands Conrad describes Willems' in-laws of the Da Souza family as "those degenerate descendants of Portugese conquerors." Cf. Alfred Russel Wallace, The Malay Archipelago: The Land of the Orang-Utan and the Bird of Paradise (London, 1886), p. 27. Wallace describes the Portuguese population of Malacca as a "mixed, degraded, and degenerate race." Cf. also Wallace, Natural Selection and Tropical Nature (London, 1891), pp. 31 -33; John Lubbock, The Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Condition of Man (New York, 1882), p. 515; Edward B. Tylor, Primitive Culture (London, 1871), I, 41. ' Lecky writes (Spirit of Rationalism, I, 207-208); "The civilised man not only knows more than the savage, he possesses an intellectual strength, a power of sustained and patient thought, of concentrating his mind steadily upon the unseen, of disengaging his conceptions from the images of the senses." Alfred Russel Wallace notes that many faculties in savages are little advanced over those in animals and that the moral sense seems to arise from the severe conflict in savages between self-interest and the welfare of the tribe.

LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 165</page><page sequence="4">between savage and civilized is carefully, even exquisitely maintained, e.g., in Dain Marolla's savage reaction to Nina's civilized grief at part ing with her father and in Babalatchi's delicate but inadequate re sponses to the aging of his master Lakamba. But in Lord Jim a native character is allowed to cross the Spencerian divide. As native chiefs Dain Waris and Dain Maroola ought to possess comparable qualities of mind. The hierarchy is vestigial in Lord Jim; further, it is altered and the substance of it almost abandoned. One must conclude that before the writing of Lord Jim some decisive influence eroded Con rad's earliest assumptions concerning primitive peoples. Rehabilitation of savage character in Lord Jim is found also in stunning tributes to the myth-making capability of the native mind. Jim's relationship with Cornelius' stepdaughter inspires a rumor in areas adjacent to Patusan that he possesses a jewel of immense value. Of this myth Marlow observes: "But do you notice how, three hundred miles beyond the end of telegraph cables and mail-boat lines, the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilisation wither and die, to be re placed by pure exercises of imagination, that have the futility, often the charm, and sometimes the deep hidden truthfulness of works of art?" (p. 348). Even though there is ambiguity in Marlow's attitude, such a statement is not conceivable in the context of Almayer's Folly or An Outcast of the Islands. The explanation that occurs most immediately for the differences enumerated is that in writing Lord Jim Conrad leaned upon his chief source, namely, writings by and about Sir James Brooke, the White Sultan of Sarawak. To a point that explanation serves. No one familiar with Brooke's letters and Conrad's novels can doubt that Brooke's native friend Budrudeen is the model for Jim's friend, Dain Waris. The following passages from the letters and journals re semble Marlow's descriptions quoted above: Budrudeen "fights like a European"; he is "a very clever fellow for a native, and far more clever than many better educated and more experienced Europeans"; he "combines decisions and abilities quite astonishing in a native prince, and a directness of purpose seldom found in an Asiatic."8 As close as these passages come to Marlow's descriptions, a mea surable difference exists still between Budrudeen and Dain Waris and between assumptions concerning primitive races held by Sir James Brooke and Marlow. Brooke's assumptions generally are rem iniscent of the eighteenth century. They appear to be survivals. • See Henry Keppel, The Expedition to Borneo of H.M.S. Dido for the Suppression of Piracy (London, 1847), II, 181; John C. Templar, ed., The Private Letters of Sir James Brooke (London, 1853), I, 269, 292. 166 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">In the passages above he assumes forthrightly an inferiority in the native mind from lack of education and refining influences. For Brooke the native who resembles a European has overcome the ad ventitious. His native has not crossed a Spencerian divide. Con sistent with eighteenth-century views of the brutish in human nature is Brooke's estimate of the general run of natives as being "with power, violent, blood-thirsty, treacherous and lying."9 Marlow does not apply these terms to the natives of Patusan even though he characterizes the lives of some of them as wretched and even though he relates native violence. Marlow concedes a larger "European" qual ity to Dain Waris than Brooke does to Budrudeen. Marlow is, in fact, more generous when treating native personality. If Marlow differs from Brooke in this respect, he differs also, ob viously, from Spencer. The dissimilarity of all three is pointed up by Marlow's use of the word altruism. The word does not appear, significantly at least, in Brooke's moral and psychological vocabulary for good reason. It is a Spencerian term and in Marlow's usage in the passage above, it retains its Spencerian meaning, that is, of an evolved attribute. But in the passage above it is applied in a non Spencerian way, namely, to a savage mind albeit that mind is ex ceptional. Premises of constitutional inferiority in the savage mind which (inconsistently but unavoidably) the term as applied conveys have been modified. It must be concluded that whereas Brooke's moral and psychological assumptions are pre-Spencerian, Marlow's in some sense are post-Spencerian. Another difference in attitude between Conrad and Brooke, namely, a different evaluation of mythmaking in the native mind, can be dealt with briefly; for nothing in Brooke matches the laudatory pas sage quoted from Conrad. Hints for the passage exist in Brooke's letters, where on one occasion he comments that Sarawak lies "beyond the limit of regular communication" and, on another, reports that the small island of Labuan off the Borneo coast is now connected by telegraph lines with Singapore and Hong Kong.10 But Brooke has no interest at all in native clairvoyance or its modes of expression. Again, Conrad's treatment seems post-Spencerian, for Marlow's admiration runs directly counter also to aspersions cast by Spencerian anthropol ogists.11 One can explain satisfactorily a persistence of some Spencerian attitudes and abandonment or alteration of others if one assumes • Letters, II, 72. u See Letters, II, 318, and Spenser St. John, Rajah Brooke: The Englishman as Ruler of an Eastern State (New York, 1899), p. 238. u See, e.g., Tylor, I, 24711. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 167</page><page sequence="6">that between Outcast of the Islands and Lord Jim, Conrad's thought was influenced by the nineteenth-century controversy over the moral and intellectual capacities of savages. A favorable estimate like that in Lord Jim was characteristic, naturally, of systems hostile to Spencer ian anthropology and psychology and to the widely disseminated Utilitarianism to which Spencer in his ethical assumptions adhered. Some common views in nineteenth-century intellectual texts are as follows. W.E.H. Lecky in his History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne drew the lines of the larger controversy for Victorian readers in this way: with reference to the origin of the moral sense, the great historical opposition, Lecky asserts, is between "intuition" and "utility," between those who rely upon an innate moral sense and those who urge the ethical principle of "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" through anticipation of pleasure and pain (I, 2-6). Lecky's own attitude is emphatic: Utilitarianism is "subversive of morality and especially, and in the very highest degree, unfavorable to self-denial and heroism" (I, 66-67). Those who believe in an innate moral sense must defend the moral stature of simple people, whether they be Malays or cottagers in the Lake District. Lecky argues that the seemingly monstrous acts of savages are, in reality, often humane (I, 102). Yet in this age few moralists could believe absolutely that society had not advanced; and Lecky, an historian of eighteenth-century rationalism, which he depicted as a discarding of primitive superstition, was no exception. His views, as in the following passage, are not free from that ambivalence which results from agreeing in some areas with an opponent's beliefs. Savage life is at least as satisfying as civilized: "if there is in the first con dition somewhat more of the weariness of monotony, there is in the second much more of the anxiety of discontent. The superiority of a highly civilised man lies chiefly in the fact that he belongs to a higher order of being, for he has approached more nearly to the end of his existence, and has called into action a larger number of his capacities" (I, 87). Elsewhere, Lecky attempts to resolve the problem in this way: he speculates that the "degree" upon which one can act on in tuitions "may become progressively higher" (I, 103). Or, again, he con cludes that morality advances through a "strengthening of the imagina tion by intellectual culture" (1,132). The scientist-theologian St. George Mivart offered the theory of a "special creation" to reconcile the Genesis account with scientific find ings. Mivart described his view as "dualistic," that of the evolutionists as "monistic." A right action for Mivart is not a motivation of the will through pleasure and pain but the result of an "intellectual intui 168 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">tion"12; and man has always been capable of such intuitions. Man thus differs from the brutes not only in degree, as Darwin argued, but in kind.13 The ethical in Mivart is intellectual rather than emo tional; selfless rather than self-interested. Mivart defends the intel ligence and moral worth of even the most primitive,14 drawing his evidence, oddly enough, from the studies of Lubbock and Tylor, even though those anthropologists, as Mivart points out, were committed to Darwinian monism and the principle of utility.15 Like Lecky, Mivart accommodates himself to the idea of progress, as in the following passage: "We may therefore fully accept Herbert Spencer's views as to the means by which materially moral habits and feelings have been evolved, and have thus prepared the way for the existence of formal morality. His error is to mistake the mere instrument of evolution for the cause."16 Mivart's borrowings from philosophy are of interest. His "special creation" is conceived in a Neo-Platonic way. Man's soul is an "immanent principle." Contemporary theories of progress and evolution are "prototypal ideas" ("types shadowed forth to our intellects by material existences, are copies of divine originals"). The old Platonic concepts have not been overthrown, but "divine prototypal ideas are one by one emerging and reappear ing, refreshed and invigorated by the bath of Darwinian Evolution ism through which they have been made to pass." Mivart's "vital powers and principles" in nature or "seminal principles" are sug gestive of a World Soul.17 But if Mivart draws upon an older philo sophy to state evolutionary theory, he draws also upon Hartmann's contemporary philosophy of the Unconscious. Such a brief passage as the following restates according to Hartmann most of the Spencerian and Neo-Platonic principles enumerated above: "All nature teems with such unconscious intelligence."18 The best-known opponent of the evolutionary account of the development of the moral sense was Alfred Russel Wallace, who simultaneously with Darwin had formulated the theory of the survival of the fittest. Wallace denied eventually that Darwinian evolution accounted adequately for man's intellectual, esthetic, and moral at tributes. He believed in a "feeling—a sense of right and wrong—in "See Nature and Thought: An Introduction to a Natural Philosophy (London, 1882), pp. 47, 159. " See Lessons from Nature, As Manifested in Mind and Matter (London, 1876), p. 129. 14 Nature and Thought, p. 166. " Lessons from Nature, pp. 93, 1S9, 164-165. M Nature and Thought, pp. 208-209. 17 Cf. Lessons from Nature, pp. 275-276, 279, S31. u Lessons from Nature, p. 240. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 169</page><page sequence="8">our nature, antecedent to and independent of experiences of utility."19 Wallace's high praise of the perfection of savage societies, inspired mainly by his experience among the Malays, was celebrated, especially as phrased in this passage: Now although we have progressed vastly beyond the savage state in intellectual achievements, we have not advanced equally in morals ... .The mass of our popula tions have not at all advanced beyond the savage code of morals, and have in many cases sunk below it. A deficient morality is the great blot of modern civil ization, and the greatest hindrance to true progress.20 Like the other two writers examined, Wallace made his own compro mise with the Spencerian adaptation of the theory of progress. Wallace distinguishes the moral from the intellectual, as in the passage quoted above, and concedes that the latter has evolved. Further, there is "continuity" in man's development; but "preterhuman intelligences" act upon natural selection.21 Wallace meant such statements literally, for he came under the influence of spiritualism and believed in the "whole arcana of the mediums." The universe moves toward the per fection of the spirit of man, that is, toward the enlargement of man's spiritualistic powers. It has become apparent from this brief review of Intuitionist writers that the "post-Spencerian" quality in Conrad's treatment of the na tives in Lord Jim corresponds in general to the "post-Spencerian" quality in the descriptions of Mivart and Wallace. Surely Conrad himself gives his altered view that kind of reference in this further description of Dain Waris: "He was of a silent disposition; a firm glance, an ironic smile, a courteous deliberation of manner seemed to hint at great reserves of intelligence and power. Such beings open to the Western eye, so often concerned with mere surfaces, the hidden possibilities of races and lands over which hang the mystery of unre corded ages" (p. 323). The passage takes the same position the In tuitionists take on a subject it acknowledges is controversial—and not merely in some general or popular sense, for the vocabulary of the statement is sophisticated and allusive. Power has no meaning in the passage in its usual sense, but it is used here as late nineteenth century psychologists use it to designate moral capability. Intelligence and power name those components which Wallace and, with reserva tion, Lecky and Mivart distinguish in and assign to the primitive mentality. Which of these writers may have had an influence or may have had the most influence are not questions which can be answered very "See Natural Selection, p. 201. *&gt;Malay Archipelago, pp. 595-596. a See the summaries in Darwinism, pp. 473-478, and in Natural Selection, pp. 212-214. 170 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">accurately; but they should be pursued because of differences existing among the three. In Lord Jim Conrad uses a phrase "intelligent volition," which Mivart uses to designate the creative mind at work in evolution or—essentially the same meaning—an immanent principle in man.22 In the courtroom Jim is attracted to Marlow by Marlow's look of "intelligent volition."23 Where Conrad found the phrase must remain uncertain, but in the midst of other traces in Conrad's fiction of a reading of evolutionary literature, it is conceivable that a phrase absorbed from Mivart here rises to the surface of Conrad's mind in an oblique and partially ironic application. Wallace's spiritualistic bias surely did not commend itself to Conrad, who gives a naturalistic analysis to most occult phenomena in his fiction; but otherwise, in spite of what seems a linguistic trace from Mivart, Wallace probably was the most influential of the three sources, if Conrad knew all three. Conrad's tribute to the symbol-making penchant of the Malays is reminiscent of Wallace's defense of savage superstition even as it is of certain passages in Mivart which celebrate the primitive imagination; but it is unlike Lecky's admiration for the Enlightenment. The even balance of the intellectual and the instinc tive in Dain Waris is somewhat more characteristic of Wallace than of Lecky or Mivart inasmuch as Wallace makes a smaller concession to the idea of progress. The Malayan subject matter strongly suggests Wallace. The partial retention of Spencerian phrases and concepts in Lord Jim might be traced to either Mivart or Wallace but more logically to Wallace, who does not fall back, as Mivart does, upon Christian and Neo-Platonic terms and concepts to express his dis agreement with evolutionary theory. The inference of indebtedness that has been taken from a first large contrast of attitudes in Conrad's early fiction is credible in view of the reference Conrad makes to Alfred Wallace in The Secret Agent; and it is credible also in view of the Conrad-Wells relationship, Wells having been conversant with contemporary writers on science and evolution. To cite one example among many, Wells knew the writ ings of the evolutionist C. Lloyd Morgan.24 Morgan's Animal Life and Intelligence has copious reference to Mivart.25 Mivart, as has been seen, refers to Wallace. Wallace refers to Lubbock, Tylor, Lecky, " Nature and Thought, p. 203. »Lord Jim, p. 38. To that aspect Jim responds later in his outcry, "I wish to be understood." "See Wells' article "The Mind in Animals," Saturday Review, December 22, 1894, p. 683. "• See Animal Life and Intelligence (Boston, 1891), pp. 316, 362, 375. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 171</page><page sequence="10">and Mivart.28 An intricate network of cross references exists in evolu tionary literature. Conrad, entering the network at any point, assisted by Wells, would have been led naturally to traverse a large part of it. II If the views of Intuitionists and Wallace's observations of the Malays may be thought to account sufficiently for Marlow's estimate in Lord Jim of the worth of primitive peoples, some further source must be drawn upon to explain Marlow's misgivings, his pessimistic uncer tainty over the future of the people of Patusan. Marlow's misgivings are phrased in such a way that an assumption of the inimical fate of races which have lost their capacity for progress is conveyed strongly to the reader—and inimical in a more profound sense than might be conveyed by some Spencerian or Utilitarian judgment concerning the low level of social life attained to by savage peoples. That Spen cerian kind of judgment is made in Almayefs Folly and Outcast of the Islands; the opinion Marlow expresses in Lord Jim is some thing else. On the day Marlow leaves Patusan, he feels himself quickened and elated, restored to "freedom" and his right milieu: "I breathed deeply, I revelled in the vastness of the opened horizon, in the different atmosphere that seemed to vibrate with a toil of life, with the energy of an impeccable world. The girl was right—there was a sign, a call in them—something to which I responded with every fibre of my being" (p. 410). "Toil of life," "impeccable world" are a contrast to the primeval atmosphere and instinctive mode of native life. Marlow identifies with ardor the sense of change imparted by the world out side; he cannot imagine any further alteration in Patusan. An appetite for the progressive conquest of nature here reacts against the sluggish ness of a primitive people and the fixity of a benignly autocratic Utopia. On this subject Marlow does express a Utilitarian point of view; but his reflections deepen into a pessimism in excess of any Utilitarian commiseration and distaste for the mode of life of back ward peoples. At the mouth of the river, some fishermen present a complaint to Jim, whom they have taken as their protector. Marlow calls their lives "trifling, miserable, and oppressed." They were once slaves of the Rajah. Jim has "changed all that"; but Marlow reflects that if he went away—"Hell loose" (pp. 411-416). The suggestion of a "See the index to On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism: Three Essays (London, 1881) for references to Lecky and Tylor; the index to Darwinism for references to Lubbock, Mivart, and Tylor. 172 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">temporary success masking a fundamental ineffectually exists earlier in Marlow's reflections on Jim's victory over Sherif Ali. Jim seems to Marlow symbolic—"a figure set upon a pedestal, to represent in his persistent youth the power, and perhaps the virtues, of races that never grow old, that have emerged from the gloom" (p. 326). But the people of Patusan in Marlow's descriptions at this point are not "races that never grow old." Jim is unique: "He dominated the forest, the secular gloom, the old mankind" (p. 326). And a few pages later Marlow summarizes Jim's victory in this way: "It had led him from strife to peace, and through death into the innermost life of the people; but the gloom of the land spread out under the sunshine preserved its appearance of inscrutable, of secular repose" (p. 322). A set of intellectual assumptions concerning primitive races can be dis cerned in these descriptions. They are not merely premonitional. Further, the description "old races living in a secular gloom" with its metaphysical overtones would be out of place among the dominant Spencerian and Utilitarian assumptions in Conrad's earlier novels of native life. Moreover, such a description does not accord well with Marlow's favorable estimate of Dain Waris and other natives or with the novel's celebration of the myth-making faculty in the native mind. A solution to this puzzle does not exist in the chief source of Con rad's novel, for Sir James Brooke is everywhere confident that the Malays "might be raised in the scale of civilization."27 An appropriate source, I believe, is Eduard von Hartmann's philosophy of the Un conscious, appropriate for this reason. As has been noted, the last and most strongly contemporary statement of an "idealistic" view of evolu tion the reader takes from Mivart is a Hartmann-like statement. A firm connection exists, also, between Wallace and Hartmann; for the latter was struck by Wallace's descriptions of the Malays, and he accepted and repeated Wallace's favorable judgment of their recti tude. Because of the references in late nineteenth-century anthropol ogy, it is most unlikely that anyone who had read Mivart or Wallace would not have gone on to consider Hartmann's radical law of evolu tion. Lord, Jim and Heart of Darkness, I believe, offer enough evidence that Conrad's reading followed that pattern. Hartmann in the Philosophy of the Unconscious agrees specifically with Wallace that "a superior intelligence has guided the develop ment of man in a definite direction, and for a special purpose."28 In determining that end Hartmann takes suggestions rather obviously from Wallace's statements that the purpose of life is to "give rise to * Letters, II, 150. * Cf. Natural Selection, p. 204; Eduard von Hartmann, Philosophy of the Unconscious (London, 1884), II, SIS. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 1/3</page><page sequence="12">higher, more active forms of life," that in this process lower, degraded races are discarded and that the final stage is a "condition of per manent stability."29 Hartmann, unlike Wallace, was a pessimist. His philosophy begins with the assumption of a "transcendent extramun dane consciousness, which feels its own content as a state to be negated, i.e., as unblessedness or torment" (II, 257). Man experiences it as an Unconscious which works through his instincts and through mystical and clairvoyant phenomena. Man deludes himself in thinking that he acts in any significant measure according to conscious motives. The irresistible will which is the Unconscious makes use of evolution to perfect and ennoble the race and to destroy inferior types with rare callousness: No power on earth is able to arrest the eradication of the inferior races of man kind, which, as relics of earlier stages of development once also passed through by ourselves, have gone on vegetating down to the present day. As little as a favour is done the dog whose tail is to be cut off, when one cuts it off gradually, inch by inch, so little is there humanity in artifically prolonging the death-struggle of savages who are on the verge of extinction. (II, 12) Hartmann means by ennoblement primarily an extension of con sciousness; and the end of the process is an equilibrium between the conscious and the unconscious. That point having been reached, the conscious can will not to be; from that moment there is no more volition, activity, or time; there is a cosmic negation of will. Hart mann's principle, as he points out, is Schopenhauer's negation of will extended from the individual to the universal (III, 127-132). Hartmann's view of evolution results in a mixed attitude toward primitive people. They are doomed; and for that reason their state is unenviable; and yet the condition of civilized man is more un desirable. The enlargement of consciousness is accompanied by in creasing pain in the psychological sense of a growing opposition be tween the intelligence and the will. For this reason people in a state of nature are happier than those in a civilized state: "a being is the happier the obtuser is its nervous system" (III, 115). Wallace's high estimate of savage life does not proceed from the same pessi mistic bias. He is closer to Mivart who, in spite of his affinity for some of Hartmann's principles, differs sharply with Hartmann's opin ion that "savages and the lower classes are happier than the educated and well-to-do . . . they recognize and exercise their animal natures." Both Wallace and Mivart hold steadily to an optimistic belief in the unfolding of human capacities.30 "See Wallace, The World of Life: A Manifestation of Creative Power, Directive Mind and Ultimate Purpose (London, 1910), pp. 185, 216; Natural Selection, pp. 184-185. 80 Cf., e.g., Mivart, Lessons from Nature, p. 402, and Wallace, Darwinism, p. 476. 174 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">Hartmann's admiration for the Malays leads his reader into an uncertainty. Hartmann appears to exempt the Malays from the fate of inferior races, and yet the attributes he assigns to them—a sound morality, the exercise of animal instincts—are not achieved by a breaking through the illusions of civilized life by the highly ad vanced, which is Hartmann's broadest ethical recommendation. Actual ly admiration for the Malays is a fortuitous accompaniment of Hart mann's negative estimate of the condition of highly civilized man. Yet the Malays as an embodiment of a moral ideal are an anomaly among Hartmann's examples; and inasmuch as Hartmnn does not acknowledge them to be an anomaly, their example tends to under mine his theory of evolution. Wallace's celebration of Malayan life is also somewhat anomalous or difficult to reconcile with his belief in the intellectual advancement of the race. The sinister suggestions in Marlow's pessimistic intuitions concern ing Jim's future in Patusan—and sinister is the only expressive word— as well as Marlow's sharp division of the races of mankind into the young and the old, those who live in the light and those who live in a "secular gloom," are more meaningful in terms of Hartmann's metaphysical addenda to the theory of evolution than in terms of Spencerian anthropology. In the immedate light of such descriptions, Jim resembles the humanitarian Hartmann describes, who is misled into a futile attempt to stay the inevitable extinction of inferior peoples. Conrad seems to symbolize the immobility of such races and their capacity for self-destruction in Doramin's massive bulk and inertia and in his killing of Jim—"all his ponderous movements were like manifestations of a mighty, deliberate force" (p. 320). In Marlow's uncertainty, further, the balance of opinion against opinion is not equally weighted; it inclines toward the pessimistic It is as though in Conrad's consciousness the stronger and more general view of Hartmann concerning the end of savage races submerges finally the uncertainty created by Hartmann's adulation of the Malays. And Hartmann's "anthropology" has that same effect on the reader. m Heart of Darkness conveys a suggestion of Hartmann's influence more strongly even than Lord Jim. The subject matter is drawn from Conrad's own experience in the Congo. Marlow's disillusionment is Conrad's disillusionment But the tale is invested with philosophical insights so suggestive of Hartmann as to make it unlikely that they were formulated with help only from immedate observation. One striking coincidence is the fact that the same two backward races that stand out in the Philosophy of the Unconscious stand out also in LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 175</page><page sequence="14">Conrad s writings. The Malays excite Hartmann's admiration, but Africans are a degraded people whom no effort can save from ex tinction (II, 12ff.). Heart of Darkness relates the failure of an ethic regarding colon ial enterprises subscribed to by company officials known to Marlow's aunt. The "brickmaker of the Central Station" calls them and their appointees such as Kurtz the "new gang—the gang of virtue." The "cause" requires "higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose." The unhappy natives are the "reclaimed, the product of the new forces at work." Kurtz is associated with a Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs; to the brickmaker he is an "emissary of pity, and science, and progress"; and his writings give Marlow the impression of an "exotic Immensity ruled by an august Bene volence"—they appeal to "every altruistic sentiment."31 Conrad here engages a kind of nineteenth-century humanitarianism which he continues to treat antagonistically in Nostromo, The Secret Agent, and Under Western Eyes. For this reason Heart of Darkness has a claim to being called the first of his social and political novels. This ethic differs in no important respect from the ethic of those bemused humanitarians in Hartmann who devote themselves to the improve ment of backward races. The similarity between Conrad and Hartmann thus far is general, but it becomes particular when one realizes that the failure of this ethic in Heart of Darkness agrees exactly with an argument in Hart mann. In the statement of Hartmann's theory of the world process, an especially devastating observation is that commercial exploitation is one of the best ways to hasten the extinction of inferior races (II, 13). Hartmann offers no better illustration of this point than Conrad offers in Marlow's description of the natives in the Grove of Death: . . they were nothing earthly now—nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air—and nearly as thin" (p. 80). On his way to the grove, Marlow encounters a group of chained criminals carrying baskets of earth from the dynamiting of a cliff. "All their meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me within six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy savages. Behind this raw matter one of the a See The Works of Joseph Conrad, V, 96, 144-145. 176 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">reclaimed, the product of the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its middle" (p. 77). The labor of these victims of the European system of law is not useful. "The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on" (p. 77). Marlow almost stumbles into an excavation. "It wasn't a quarry or sandpit, anyhow, It was just a hole. It might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals some thing to do" (p. 79). The genocidal result—Hartmann's result—of ventures undertaken in the name of universal benevolence is apparent in all these examples. And the kind of irony encountered here, al though its sharpness must be due to first-hand observation, in the whole context of the novel has a wryness and philosophical weight very suggestive of Hartmann. How close the correspondence between Conrad and Hartmann is can be estimated further in certain associational patterns in that part of the text quoted above. The noise of the blasting makes Marlow think of the shelling of the coast by a French man-of-war, which he witnessed earlier. "It was the same kind of ominous voice; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea" (p. 77). The shelling at the time strikes Marlow as a piece of "insanity" without visible result or effectiveness. The principle of association in the images and ideas of Marlows later reminiscence, first of all, is the common end of extermination these forms of "warfare" have and, secondly, is the principle of contrast between the effective and the ineffective. These are peculiar and complex associations and are diffi cult to explain as anything other than effects of Hartmann's racial theories, especially of his ironic assertion that with respect to the extinction of inferior races, "humane" methods are superior to out right warfare. One thinks of Hartmann also in connection with Kurtz's abandon ment of his humanitarian ideals. At some time during his bizarre activities among the natives, Kurtz writes this postscript to an earlier, visionary report to the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs: "Exterminate all the brutes!" (p. 145). This pro nouncement must strike the reader as a conversion to a Hartmann-like ethic. Hartmann writes, "The true philanthropist, if he has compre hended the natural law of anthropological evolution, cannot avoid de siring an acceleration of the last convulsions, and laboring for that end" (p. 212). The novel makes much of one other pronouncement by Kurtz, his last words, "The horror. The horror," which are a LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 177</page><page sequence="16">"judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth" (pp. 183 186). Hartmann makes a similar judgment. Thus far it has been possible to discuss Heart of Darkness in terms of Hartmann's racial theories, as they are related to Hartmann's ethic. It is possible, also, to discuss Heart of Darkness in terms of Hartmann's racial theories as they are related to Hartmann's chief metaphysical principle, the fact of the Unconscious. Marlow's voyage from the coastal port to the Inner Station induces in Marlow most of those same insights which turn Kurtz into a pessimist or, in the light of the discussion above, those insights by means of which Hart mann's philanthropist comprehends the "natural law of anthropologi cal evolution." Those insights in Hartmann and in Heart of Darkness have to do with the Unconscious as a metaphysical principle and with man in his most primitive and most highly advanced states. Critics have taken Marlow's journey to be symbolic of an introspec tion in a Jungian sense; but in Marlow's case, as opposed to Kurtz's, too much has been made of its symbolic character. Marlow's insights are immediate inferences from observed facts; and his journey has often the appearance of a sociological venture. Marlow observes, in the first place, the aspect of prehistoric man; the steamer's progress up the river inspires a "wild and passionate uproar" in the natives on the banks—"They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces" (p. 117). The Africans on board the steamer in the incongruity of their functions reveal themselves even more strikingly as creatures of irrational impulse. The fireman comprehends his task as a placating of an evil spirit in the boiler—"to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and feather hat, walking on his hind legs." In the helmsman the sense of duty rests so lightly on ferocious instincts that, during the attack on the steamer, he was "lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse" (p. 134; cf. pp. 118-119). Introspectively Marlow recognizes in himself the same savage character. He responds to the "howl" and the "dance." By inference and intuition combined Marlow formulates this statement of the atavistic Unconscious: "The mind of man is capable of anything—because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future" (p. 117). The existence of this di mension of mind is a conclusion Conrad might have reached from reading late Spencerian anthropologists and psychologists; but in most instances they are led to recognize and emphasize the atavistic Unconscious because they are familiar with Hartmann's philosophy. A reversion to savagery, however, is not the ultimate danger which besets Marlow and other Europeans. The atavistic is merely an aspect of a more profound psychological change; the wilderness awakens in 178 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">the unwary not only "brutal instincts" but also "monstrous pas sions" (p. 176). The chain gang by the Grove of Death is not the invention of savages but of "strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men—men, I tell you" (p. 78). Kurtz is not a savage but a "flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly," and he is also a "remarkable" man (pp. 78, 184-185). In comparison with his abominations, "uncomplicated savagery," to Marlow, is a "positive relief" (p. 161). Marlow's insight, it can be argued, goes beyond apprehension of the atavistic Unconscious to apprehension of something like Hartmann's primal Unconscious. Phrases above seem an elaboration of the evil aspect the primal Unconscious has in Hartmann—"the Unconscious has always something uncomfortably demonic about it" (II, 40). They seem an elaboration also of the capacity for evil Hartmann finds in Geniuses and in the supremely civilized. Marlow's insight with reference to the primal Unconscious is an inference—with some admixture of introspection—from the progressive alteration of character in Europeans he meets along his route. But, more importantly, it is an inference from his observation of nature. The function of Marlow's voyage in this respect is, again, not sym bolic; and even though his observations are sometimes couched in metaphor, they are not a metaphorical enhancement of a naturalistic philosophy. Even as the aspect of man at the beginning of time is "inhuman," so the aspect of the earth is unearthly. "We are accus tomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there—there you could look at a thing monstrous and free" (pp. 116 117). Centuries of man's toil have transformed the earth into as "sunny an arrangement of small conveniences as the mind of man can conceive," to use a phrase from Lord Jim (p. 387). But its primeval aspect is one not of light but of darkness, not of benevolence but of malevolence. "Monster" concentrates impressions of sun and shadow and rioting vegetation and treacherous reaches into a personification which even in the quoted passage goes beyond literary personification and in the course of the novel is apprehended as a metaphysical entity. One way in which the novel raises nature to that level is by as signing it attributes. "There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine." The stillness "did not in the least resemble a peace." It "looked at you with a vengeful aspect." The "high stillness" confronts Europeans "with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fan tastic invasion" (pp. 111-113). Is not the lack of joy and peace in the heart of darkness an intuition like Hartmann's intuition that the existence of the world is an act of blind will "illuminated by no ray LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 179</page><page sequence="18">of rational intelligence," that the Unconscious feels its existence as a "torment" and a "state to be negated" (II, 257, 273)? The wilderness has volition. It raises its formidable coast as an obstacle; it waylays the steamer with the hazards of the river. Even though there is a certain amount of metaphor in these descriptions, they are not merely a way of speaking, an effect of Marlow's idiom. Eventually they form part of the novel's statement of Kurtz's rela tionship with the wilderness; and the most important passages of that statement are not figurative: "it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite" (pp. 141-142). The "veng eance" the wilderness takes on Kurtz and other Europeans, presumably for their interference, must be that it makes them instruments of its own dark purpose. Such implications in the novel seem a translit eration of Hartmann's theory of the world process. The presence Marlow senses and observes, further, is not the dark ness of Africa only; it is a universal darkness. England has been one of the "dark places of the earth"—Marlow expands on that theme in the prelude to his tale (pp. 57-60). The presence is not simply the primal aspect of the earth—that naturalistic explanation will not do, for the presence remains after the earth is transformed into a domin ion of light and order. Marlow says that the "stillness" which watched him at his navigational labors, his "monkey tricks," also watches his listeners "performing on your respective tight-ropes" in England (pp. 113-114). This is extraordinary logic. One must conclude that in Heart of Darkness Nature is as strong a metaphysical principle as can exist in a work of fiction; there is no other conclusion. Perhaps the most extraordinary part of the logic of nature is that the metaphysical is the physical. That fact might not be surprising in the early nineteenth century, but it is in the late, unless one is aware that Hartmann's contemporary metaphysics is pantheistic. Thus the treatment of nature in Heart of Darkness is a further reason for thinking Conrad was affected by Hartmann's theories. One way of gauging their similarity is by considering the traditional question of immanence and transcendence. The relationship in Heart of Dark ness between the earth's primal aspect and the shackled "monster" is relevant to that question. That relationship, cryptically expressed in Marlow's bantering of his listeners, is a deduction by analogy from the relationship of man's intellectual superstructure to an unconscious and instinctive base. Inasmuch as in this analogy the Unconscious has a predominantly atavistic character, the aspect of original darkness tends to be primeval and to suggest immanence rather than trans 180 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">cendence. Darkness endures beneath the artificialities and illusions man creates in himself and in nature. Immanence is emphasized also by the fact that Marlow observes the primal Unconscious empirically in space and time. The accessi bility of the metaphysical to this way of knowing is unique and might be thought to result from imaginative license, i.e., from the intrusion of an inferior sort of symbolism, were a likely origin not apparent in Hartmann's peculiar pantheism. Hartmann formulates his pantheism or monism in opposition to this philosophical principle, namely, that individuation and plurality are merely subjective appearance. By means of this principle, Hartmann observes, Kant, Fichte, and Schopenhauer answer the question, "if the Essential Being that mani fests itself in the world is sole and indivisible, whence comes the plural ity of appearing individuals?" In Hartmann individuation "has not merely an apparent reality for consciousness but a reality apart from all consciousness"; space and time are "not merely forms of intuition, but also forms of existence of the of itself."32 This emphasis on the immanence of the absolute and the Tightness of human perceptions allows, as no other idealistic philosophy does allow, the kind of ob servation and inference Marlow employs. But if Hartmann rehabili tates ordinary perception, Hartmann's insights, nonetheless, result from corrected observation, i.e., from attention and selection affected by the theory of evolution. Marlow's journey has for his insights that same epistemological significance. It strips truth of the "cloak of time." If the immanence of the Unconscious is brought out by Marlow's education, its transcendence is an effect of the involution of Kurtz's ego. That is to say, the aspect the Unconscious wears is determined largely by the way of knowing, the empirical or the experiential. Because Marlow's way of knowing is preeminent in the novel, the strongest impression is one of immanence; and that stress agrees with Hartmann's. The transcendental suggestiveness of Kurtz's regression can be measured by the epistemological significance Marlow's voyage, which is also Kurtz's voyage, has in the novel. That significance is conveyed symbolically; and, indeed, I believe, to convey it is the ultimate importance and function of symbolism in the novel. Eight miles from the Inner Station nature at dusk assumes a new aspect, a "dumb immobility"—it was "unnatural, like a state of trance." And the next morning the fog had settled, obliterating everything except the steamer. "The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere" (pp. 123-125). This new "See the Chapter "Individuation," Philosophy of the Unconscious, II, SS2-S55, especially $40. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 181</page><page sequence="20">phase of the journey is symbolic of the crossing of a line which can be described in these two ways: in the suggestion that the earth is nowhere, the time regression represented by the journey passes beyond the beginning of time and space. And, secondly, because of the proximity to Kurtz, the symbolism suggests that barrier has been crossed beyond which Kurtz's clairvoyance of the primal Unconscious exceeds the reach of Marlow's empirical observation. Marlow looks at "truth stripped of its cloak of time"; Kurtz apprehends the Un conscious in its anteriority to time. If any one adjective in Hartmann suggests the relationship between the immanence and transcendence of the primal Unconscious, it is the word extra-mundane, an equiv alent of which, "extra-terrestrial," Conrad uses in describing the un conscious aspect of love in Lord Jim (p. 342). The primacy of mundane, the additiveness of extra intimate the secondary importance of the transcendence of the primal Unconscious in Hartmann's panthe ism. By literary means, the symbolism of the journey and the pre eminence of Marlow's point of view, Heart of Darkness conveys that relationship exactly. This study has argued that Conrad's view of primitive races changes between his first two novels and Lord Jim. In the latter Conrad con veys an un-Spencerian view of primitive mentality, one that bears comparison with the views of Intuitionists in the period and with the view of Hartmann. Sinister suggestions in Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness with respect to the fate of backward peoples have been referred especially to Hartmann as the most appropriate source, and the result has been a considerable elucidation of Marlow's atti tudes. The Unconscious is a fact in both Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim (in the latter novel Marlow examines at length Jim's unconscious motives for leaving the Patna). Modern criticism has not ignored this feature of the work but has referred it to the psy chology of Jung, thereby making Conrad's treatment purely and spontaneously imaginative. It is not credible that Conrad was in this respect unsophisticated. Faced with the fact of the Unconscious in Conrad's fiction and given the Conrad-Wells relationship (Wells was familiar with the German Pessimists), one must have recourse to Hartmann, who articulated for late Victorian thought the theory of the Unconscious. Conrad's assumptions in A Imayefs Folly and Outcast of the Islands are Spencerian and Utilitarian. Significant alteration or questioning of such attitudes must suggest an influence from Schopenhauer and Hartmann, who, at the end of the century offered the most important challenge to English philosophy. Wells' thought, essentially Darwinian and Utilitarian, although not altered was af 182 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="21">fected in that way. This study suggests that Conrad's thought in the period of their close association came under similar influences. This study does not suggest that the dominant thematic veins of Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim necessarily agree with Hartmann's philosophy. Nor does this study aim to establish a point-by-point in debtedness or influence. It seeks to establish, rather, a relevance. In Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness Marlow is educated to the fact of the Unconscious. And he views events often from the vantage point of someone familiar with Pessimistic views, even though his charac teristic bias is Utilitarian. His mind stretches itself in one direction or another. He is not entirely consistent. But he appears to reflect in ways detailed above the condition of Conrad's mind at a certain point in his development as a moralist. LORD JIM AND HEART OF DARKNESS 183</page></plain_text>
