IN the following reflections I shall start from what I consider an undeniable fact, namely, that the modern temper is uncongenial to the idea of immortality. It is that over and above the objec- tions which the modern intellect entertains against it on theoreti- cal grounds. These-which for brevity I will simply grant en bloc - are by themselves indecisive. As transcendental, the ob- ject of the idea - immortality itself - is beyond proof or dis- proof: it is not an object of knowledge. But the idea of it is. Therefore, the intrinsic merits of its meaning become the sole measure of its credibility, and the appeal of such meaning remains as the sole ground of possible belief - as certainly the lack of such appeal is sufficient ground for actual disbelief. But since what is meaningful depends, beyond the mere condition of logi- cal consistency, largely on the dispositions and insights of the mind that judges it, we must interrogate these for their prevalent unresponsiveness as well as for any possible hold which the idea, even in its present eclipse, may still have, or reclaim, on our secu- larized estate. Thus an examination of the problem at this hour will be as much an examination of ourselves as an examination of the issue of immortality; and even if it should throw no new light on the latter, on which in more than two thousand years probably everything has been said there is to say, it may yet throw some light on the present state of our mortal condition. I On the inhospitableness of the contemporary mind to the idea of immortality I can, indeed must, be very brief, since much has been said about it in our century, and the area of agreement is</page><page sequence="2">2 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW broad, and little disputed; whereas on the less noticed, and less obvious, opening which the modern mind does offer to the idea in one of its possible meanings, and does so precisely by its 'mod- ern' turn, I shall have to dwell at some length. This 'opening,' however, stands forth essentially from the negative background without which the modern temper would not be what it is. First, then, a look at the negative side. Let me start with the oldest and most empirical concept of immortality: survival by immortal fame. This was most prized in antiquity and consid- ered not only the just reward of noble deeds but a prime incen- tive to them.' The deeds must be visible, that is, public, to be noted and remembered as great. The dimension of this living-on is the dimension itself in which it is earned: the body politic. Immortal fame is thus public honor in perpetuity, as the body politic is human life in perpetuity. Now, already Aristotle pointed out that honor is worth just as much as the judgment of those who bestow it.2 But then, the desire for it, and a fortiori the de- 'Throughout Greek letters, from Homer to Plato, who marks the philosophic overcoming of the ideal but gives it eloquent expression in the words of Diotima: "Think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have run for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal. Do you im- agine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patro- clus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? Nay, I am persuaded that all men do all things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal" (Symposium 20o8 c-d; tr. B. Jowett). Per- haps the loftiest statement of the ideal occurs in Pericles' Funeral Oration on the Athenian dead in the first year of the Peloponnesian war: "They received, each for his own memory, praise that will never die, and with it the grandest of all sepulchres, not that in which their mortal bones are laid, but a home in the minds of men, where their glory remains fresh to stir to speech or action as the occasion comes by. For the whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men, and their story is not graven only in stone over their native earth, but lives far away, without visible symbol, woven into the stuff of other men's lives" (Thucydides, II 43; tr. A. Zimmern, The Greek Commonwealth, p. 207).--Not long ago, I encountered the ancient sentiment unalloyed in (of all places) television when one of our astro- nauts-in-training, asked what had made him volunteer for the task, answered "Frankly, the chance of immortality; for this, I would willingly give my life." Given with engaging simplicity, there was no doubting the candor of the reply. Events in the meantime may have caused some reflections on how much, besides the merits of dedication and ability, also opportunity and luck--and not only our own, but that of unknown others - rule over this kind of immortality. "In discussing why honor cannot be "the good": it rests in those who bestow</page><page sequence="3">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 3 sire for its extension into posthumous fame, and ultimately the estimation of this form of immortality in principle, are justified only by the trust we can reasonably place in the integrity of its trustee and master, namely, public opinion: in its enlightenment now, its faithfulness in the future - and, of course, in its own unceasing continuity, that is, the indefinite survival of the com- monwealth. Now on all these counts the modern temper cannot permit itself the innocent confidence of the Greeks. The selec- tiveness as such of this 'immortality': that it admits few and excludes most, we might accept if only we could believe in the justice of the selection. But for that we know too much of how reputations are made, how fame is fabricated, public opinion en- gineered, the record of history re-made, and even pre-made, to the order of interest and power. In the age of the party lines, and, for that matter, of Madison Avenue, in the age of the uni- versal corruption of the word, we are sadly aware that speech, the vehicle of this immortality, is the medium of lies as well as of truth, and more often the former than the latter in the public sphere - with a busily fostered growth between them of unmean- ingness, not even fit for either, eating away into both; and the older suspicion whether we are not dealing with a tale told by an idiot is overshadowed by the worse that it might be a tale concocted by knaves. Further, if generally the premium put on the spectacular at the expense of the hidden provokes our disdain, the great evil- doers we moderns have had the fortune to know face us with the wholly repugnant perspective that the famous and the in- famous come to stand on a par: for let no one deceive himself on the fact that to the perversity of those agents, and to that of a posterity responding to theirs, their evil fame is an achievement and not a penalty: and so the Hitlers and Stalins would have suc- ceeded to extract immortality from the extinction of their name- less victims. Shall we add that only the vain craves immortality of name, it rather than in him who receives it, whereas the good must be one's inalienable own; further, we seek it, i.e., the reputation of being good, as a confirmation of our being good, therefore from people who have good judgment, and adequate knowledge of us, and who accord honor to virtue--which on this admission stands as the primary good: Eth. Nic. 1o95 b 22-30.</page><page sequence="4">4 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW while the truly proud and good can do with anonymous survival of his work? This leads to another version of the empirical con- cept: immortality of influence - to some extent the hope of every earnest effort in the service of higher purpose. But, alas, there again we are too worldly wise to trust in the worldly causality of things as a faithful repository of acts, since we can credit it neither with adequate discrimination of worth nor with its con- servation in the shifts of time. This much, sober judgment could always have known. But we know something more and never known before: that the repository itself, namely human civiliza- tion, is perishable. This new knowledge invalidates both con- cepts, immortality of name and of influence - even that of great works of art and thought, which most of all resist obliteration by time: for what is itself mortal cannot well be the vehicle of immortality. With the dramatic sharpening which the generally modern awareness of the passing nature of cultures and societies has undergone more recently - to the point where the survival of the human race itself seems in jeopardy - our presumptive immortality, as that of all the immortals before us, appears sud- denly at the mercy of a moment's miscalculation, failure, or folly by a handful of fallible men. II Let us, then, turn to the non-empirical and really substantive concept of immortality: survival of the person in an hereafter. This finds itself at even greater odds with the modern temper. I do not concern myself with the persuasive inference from the indubitable organic basis of 'person' to its essential non-separable- ness therefrom. But, do at least the non-empirical reasonings be- hind the postulate still have our ear? The serious ones, if we dismiss the mere creaturely recoil from death, fall roughly under two heads: justice, and the distinction between appearance and reality, of which the idea of the mere phenomenality of time is a case. Both have this in common that they accord to man the metaphysical status of moral subject and, as such, of belonging to a moral or 'intelligible' order besides the sensible one. This should not be lightly dismissed. But the principle of justice, be</page><page sequence="5">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 5 it retributive or compensatory justice, does by its own criterion not support the claim to immortality. For temporal merit or guilt calls for temporal, not eternal retribution, and justice thus re- quires at most a finite afterlife for settling accounts, not an in- finity of existence. And as to compensation for undeserved suf- fering, or denied chances, or missed happiness here, there applies the additional consideration that a claim to happiness as such (how much of it?) is questionable to begin with; and that missed fulfillment could only be made up for in its original terms, that is, in the terms of effort and obstacles and uncertainty and fallibility and unique occasion and limited time - in short: in terms of non-guaranteed attainment and possible miss. These are the very terms of self-fulfillment, and they are precisely the terms of the world. To try in them our being, and to experience the vicis- situdes of our try, not knowing the outcome in advance - this is our genuine claim. Without those terms, without the anxious- ness of chance and the zest of challenge and the sweetness of achievement under them, no bliss gratuitously granted can be any- thing but a counterfeit coin for what has been missed. It also would lack all moral worth. Indeed the here cannot be traded for a there - such is our present stance. This also contains the modern temper's response to the dis- tinction of appearance and reality. I have always felt that the idealistic philosophers who profess it may have been too sheltered from the shock of the external, so that they could regard it as a spectacle, a representation on a stage. They certainly do less than honor to what they demote to mere appearance. We hard- pressed children of the now insist on taking it seriously. Where we find it deceptive we take a harder look at it to make its truth more truly appear. The starkness of a barren mountainside, the beauty of an animated face, are the direct language of reality. And when in horror we look at the pictures from Buchenwald, at the wasted bodies and distorted faces, at the utter defilement of humanity in the flesh --we reject the consolation that this is appearance and the truth is something else: we face the terrible truth that the appearance is the reality, and that there is nothing more real than what here appears. Most unsympathetic, perhaps, is modern philosophy to the</page><page sequence="6">6 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW view that time is not ultimately real but only the phenomenal form under which a timeless, noumenal reality appears to a subject which 'in itself' is of that noumenal world. This was the tenuous theoretical link to possible personal immortality left by Kant's critical idealism, and it has withered away in the climate of the modern mind. From the discovery of Man's basic historicity to the ontological elaboration of the innermost temporality of his being, it has been borne in upon us that time, far from being a mere form of phenomena, is of the essence of such things as selves, and that its finitude for each is integral to the very authenticity of his existing. Rather than dissemble, we claim our perishability: we do not wish to forego the pang and poignancy of finitude: we in- sist on facing nothingness and on having the strength to live with it. Thus, without a secret life-line for re-assurance, existential- ism, this extreme offspring of the modern temper or distemper, throws itself into the waters of mortality. And we, whether of its doctrine or not, share enough of its spirit to have taken our lonely stand in time between the twofold nothing of before and after. III And yet - we feel, temporality cannot be the whole story, because in man it has an inherently self-surpassing quality, of which the very fact and fumbling of our idea of eternity is a cryptic signal. If everlastingness is a wrong concept, eternity may have other meanings - and a reference to the temporal of which our mortal experience, transcending its mere transience in the stream of events, may sometimes bear witness. The opaque- ness of the here and now clears at times as if by sudden precipita- tion at the critical point: if there is any such transparency of the temporal for the eternal, however rare and brief, then the moments and modes in which it comes to pass can give us a clue as to what of our being, if not the substance of our selves, may be said to reach into the deathless and, therefore, to be our stake in immortality. In what situations and in what forms do we encounter the eternal? When do we feel the wings of time- lessness touch our heart and immortalize the now? In what</page><page sequence="7">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 7 manner does the absolute enter the relativities of our everyday existence? I shall not invoke the testimony of mystical experiences that are not mine and, if they were, would find their claim come under the invincible suspicion of the modern mind. Nor should the unsolicitable encounters of love or of beauty, which we might grant to be flashes of eternity, be summoned as evidence in dis- course as if they were at our call, to the complacence of him who can claim them, and the discomfiture of him who cannot. Rather, in keeping with the modern temper, I turn to the one kind of evi- dence that depends on ourselves because we are active there, not receptive, wholly subject and in no way object. In moments of decision, when our whole being is involved, we feel as if acting under the eyes of eternity. What can we mean by it - nay, by our willing that it be so? We may express our feeling in different symbols according to articulate beliefs which we hold, or to the images we cherish. We may say, for instance, that what we do now will make an indelible entry in the 'Book of Life,' or leave an indelible mark in a transcendent order; that it will affect that order, if not our own destiny, for good or for evil; that we shall be accountable for it before a timeless seat of justice, or - if we are not there for the accounting, because we have flowed down the river of time - that our eternal image is determined by our present deed, and that through what we do to that image of ours here and now, we are responsible for the spiritual totality of images that evergrowingly sums up the record of being and will be different for our deed. Or, less metaphysi- cally, we may say that we wish to act so that, whatever the out- come here in the incalculable course of mundane causality - whether success or miscarriage - we can live with the spirit of our act through an eternity to come, or die with it the instant after this. Or, that we are ready to see ourselves, in an eternal re- currence of all things, when our turn comes round and again we stand poised as now, blind as now, unaided as now - to see ourselves making the same decision again, and ever again, always passing the same imaginary test, endlessly re-affirming what is yet each time only once. Or, failing that certainty of affirmation, that at least the agony of infinite risk may be rightfully ours.</page><page sequence="8">8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW And in this, eternity and nothingness meet in one: that the 'now' justifies its absolute status by exposing itself to the criterion of being the last moment granted of time. To act as if in the face of the end is to act as if in the face of eternity, if either is taken as a summons to unhedging truth of selfhood. But to understand the end in this way is really to understand it in a light from be- yond time. IV What shall we make of these feelings and metaphors, and what, if anything, do they contribute, what hints do they furnish towards the issue of immortality? It will be noted that the symbols re- ferred to speak, not of immortality, but of eternity - which, to be sure, is deathlessness, but not necessarily mine, yet must have such a relation to my mortality that with something in or of my being I can, even must, share in it. What can that be? Let us further note that in all those symbols it was not the realm of feeling but that of acting, not the matter of bliss and pain but the spirit of decision and deed, in short, not our passive but our active nature, which came to stand in a relation to eternity. Let us take that hint. It seems a paradox at first. For is it not feel- ing which has duration, which spreads over time and, as a time- filling content, can at least be thought spread out indefinitely? whereas decision is of all the most transient occupant of time, an infinitesimal magnitude in extension, entirely lodged in the mo- ment and irretrievably carried off with its fleeting now? And is it not feeling which craves immortality, which wishes to last, which tells to the moment 'O stop and stay!' while the act presses on, self-liquidating, looking beyond itself, not even wishing to stay, nay, wishing to end? The paradox is that in what is self- negating, not in what is self-affirming with respect to lastingness, we should look for the relation - as yet undefined - to eternity. But perhaps the paradox contains its own hint. For that which has extension may have more or less of it, but must have an end: duration feeds on the boon of magnitude, but is also enclosed in its limits: its benefit from the largess of a sensible continuum is at the same time its confinement --the confinement to its own</page><page sequence="9">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 9 immanence. Lasting as long as it does, it cannot outlast itself. On the other hand, the critical divide of the existential now, in which free action is born, has dimension only by accident and is not measured by it. The evanescence as much as the protrac- tion of its sensible span is defied by a transcendence of mean- ing which is indifferent to the long or the short of duration. Thus it may well be that the point of the moment, not the expanse of the flux, is our link to eternity: and the 'moment' not as the nunc stans, the 'standing now,' in which the mystic tastes release from the movement of time, but moment as the momentum-giving motor of that very movement. On the threshold of deed holding time in suspense, but not a respite from time, it exposes our being to the timeless and with the turn of decision speeds us into action and time. Swiftly reclaimed by the movement it actuates, it marks man's openness to transcendence in the very act of com- mitting him to the transience of situation, and in this double ex- posure, which compounds the nature of total concern, places the responsible agent between time and eternity. From this place- between springs ever new the chance of new beginning, which ever means the plunge into the here and now. Thus, to say it again, not what lasts longest in our experience, but what lasts shortest and is intrinsically most adverse to last- ingness, may turn out to be that which binds the mortal to the immortal. From its testimony, then, we can perhaps extract a better meaning of what, inadequately, is called the 'immortality of man,' than the literal ones we have found wanting. Let us at least proceed on that expectation and by that hint. To look in this direction for a tenable concept of immortality is in keeping with the modern temper which we found so keenly conscious of the essential temporality of our being, of its in- trinsic reference to finite situation, and so suspicious of the pos- sibility and the very sense of endless self-persistence. And it is also in keeping with the most meaningful, if misapplied, aspects in traditional ideas of immortality. It was the meteoric flash of deed and daring which was to be immortalized by worldly fame; the life-sum of purpose, acts, and failure to act, on which retri- bution in an afterlife was to be visited; our moral being, from which alone Kant held immortality of the person to be arguable</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW - as a postulate of 'practical' (not an inference of theoretical) reason. Dubious as the vehicle of fame has been found, faulty as the correlation of temporal merit with eternal reward or pun- ishment, invalid as the argument of infinite perfectibility and the supposed right thereto - the aspect of justice as such in these ideas of immortality, as against the wholly untenable argument from indestructible substance, still commands in us a stirring of acknowledgment by the transcendent dignity it confers on the realm of decision and deed. Let us then follow the intimations of our acting experience, of our freedom and responsibility, and take the tentative term of an 'immortality of deeds' for our lead in interrogating some of the quoted metaphors which must them- selves have sprung from intimations of just that kind. I wish to choose two of those we encountered: the 'Book of Life,' and the transcendent 'Image.' V What can the symbol of the Book of Life tell us? In Jewish tradition it means a kind of heavenly ledger wherein our 'names' shall be inscribed according to our deserts: we shall qualify by our deeds to be inscribed 'for life,' namely ours. But instead of seeing deeds in the light of deserts, to be accounted to the agent, we can choose to see them as counting in themselves - and then adopt a different concept of the Book whereby it fills with deeds rather than names. We are, in other words, speaking of the possibility that deeds inscribe themselves in an eternal memoir of time; that whatever is here enacted somehow registers - beyond its registering and eventual dissipating in the causal patterns of time - in a transcendent realm by rules of effect quite different from those of the world, ever swelling the unfinished record of being and forever shifting the anxious balance of its reckoning. Might it not even be, to venture yet a step further, that what we thus add to the record is of surpassing import - not indeed for a future destiny of ours, but for the concern of that spiritual account itself kept by the unified memory of things? and that, although we mortal agents have no further stake in the immor- tality which our acts go to join, these acts of ours, and what</page><page sequence="11">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 11 through them we make of our lives, may just be the stake which an undetermined and vulnerable eternity has in us? And with our freedom, what a precarious stake! - Are we, then, perhaps an experiment of eternity? our very mortality - a venture of the immortal ground with itself? our freedom - the summit of the venture's chance and risk? We turn for further advice to another simile, that of the tran- scendent 'Image' filled in, feature by feature, by our temporal deeds. We encounter it in gnostic literature, especially of the Iranian branch, in several versions. One is the conception of a celestial double of the terrestrial self, which the departing soul will meet after death: "I go to meet my image and my image comes to meet me: it caresses and embraces me as if I were returning from captivity" --thus a Mandaean source.3 And in the beautiful Hymn of the Pearl, this 'double' (first described as a 'raiment'), when meeting the returning 'prince,' is recognized by him as the image of his own self, and in turn acknowledges him as the one "for whom I was reared in my Father's house, and I perceived in myself how my stature grew in accordance with his labors." I According to this version, then, everyone seems to have his alter ego, 'kept safe' in the upper world while he labors down below, yet as to its state ultimately entrusted to his responsibility: symbolizing the eternal self of the person, it grows with his trials and deeds, and its form is perfected by his toils- perfected or else, we must say, re- membering The Picture of Dorian Gray, spoiled and defiled by them. In the salvational turn of our texts this sinister but logi- cally necessary alternative is regularly omitted. There, the en- counter as such marks the successful conclusion of the soul's earthly journey and results in a consummating fusion of the two, a mutual absorption, a re-uniting of what was temporarily parted. 8Ginza, left, 31 (end): M. Lidzbarski (tr.), Ginzi. Der Schatz oder Das Grosse Buch der Mandier. G5ttingen 1925, p. 559, 29-32. In an Avestic source, this image addresses the soul thus: "I am, O youth of good thoughts, good words, good deeds, good conscience, none other than thine own personal conscience. ... Thou hast loved me . . . in this sublimity, goodness, beauty . . . in which I now appear unto thee" (Hid6kht Nask 2.9 ff.). *The Hymn of the Pearl (or Hymn of the Soul) is a gnostic poem included in the apocryphal Acts of the Apostle Thomas: on text and interpretation cf.

Boston 1958, ch. 5, pp. 112-129; for bibliography cf. ibid., p. 296.</page><page sequence="12">12 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW However, beside this individualized there is a collective version of the image symbolism, which connects our deeds not with a perpetuity of our separate selves but with the consummation of the divine self. I quote from one of Mani's writings, discovered thirty years ago in a Coptic translation in Egypt. "At the end, when the cosmos is being dissolved, the Thought of Life shall gather himself in and shall form his Self in the shape of the Last Image.5 . . . With his Living Spirit he shall catch the Light and the Life that is in all things, and build it onto his body." . . . "He gathers in his own Soul unto himself and forms himself in the shape of this Last Image. And thou shalt find him as he sweeps out of himself and casts out the impurity which is alien to him, but gathers in to himself the Life and the Light that is in all things and builds it onto his body. Then, when this Last Image is perfected in all its members, then it shall . . . be lifted out of the great struggle through the Living Spirit . . . who comes and . . . fetches the members out of . . . the dissolu- tion and the end of all things." 6 It would take us far beyond the time limits of this address to expound the precise dogmatic meaning of this symbolism. It must suffice to say that what is here called 'the last image,' emerg- ing at the end of time, is according to Manichaean doctrine built up progressively over and through the world process as a whole: all history, of life in general and of man in particular, incessantly works at it and, in the 'final image,' restores to its pristine full- ness that immortal but passable deity, called 'Primal Man,' whose initial self-surrender to the darkness and danger of becoming made the material universe possible - and necessary at the same time. - Now, neither the reasons Mani gives for this initial sur- render, nor their more sophisticated alternatives in other gnostic speculations, nor, in general, the denigration of corporeal nature as such common to all these versions, will be acceptable to the modern mind in its resolutely anti-dualistic temper - this a sub- ject related to ours but too vast to go into now.

Yet the motif of the total 'image' can speak to us across these barriers of doctrine and mood. Let us note what in it is potentially significant for us. I for one would note these features. In the temporal trans- actions of the world, whose fleeting now is ever swallowed by the past, an eternal presence grows, its countenance slowly defining itself as it is traced with the joys and sufferings, the triumphs and defeats of divinity in the experiences of time, which thus immor- tally survive. Not the agents, which must ever pass, but their acts enter into the becoming godhead and indelibly form his never decided image. God's own destiny, his doing or undoing, is at stake in this universe to whose unknowing dealings he com- mitted his substance, and man has become the eminent repository of this supreme and ever betrayable trust. In a sense, he holds the fate of deity in his hands. This, I contend, makes sense and as a hypothetical background of metaphysical fact can validate those subjective feelings about an eternal issue which we experience in the call of conscience, in the moments of supreme decision, in the total commitment of deed, and even in the agony of remorse - and these may well be the only empirical signs of an immortal side to our being which our present critical consciousness will still be ready to consider in evidence. VI But into what complete metaphysics would such a hypothetical fragment fit? If, as one sometimes cannot resist doing, I permit myself the license of ignorance, which in these matters is our lot, and the vehicle of myth or credible imagination, which Plato allowed for it, I am tempted to thoughts like these. In the beginning, for unknowable reasons, the ground of being, or the Divine, chose to give itself over to the chance and risk and endless variety of becoming. And wholly so: entering into the</page><page sequence="14">14 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW adventure of space and time, the deity held back nothing of itself: no uncommitted or unimpaired part remained to direct, correct, and ultimately guarantee the devious working-out of its destiny in creation. On this unconditional immanence the modern temper insists. It is its courage or despair, in any case its bitter honesty, to take our being-in-the-world seriously: to view the world as left to itself, its laws as brooking no interference, and the rigor of our belonging to it as not softened by extramundane provi- dence. The same our myth postulates for God's being in the world. Not, however, in the sense of pantheistic immanence: if world and God are simply the same, the world at each moment and in each state represents His fullness, and God can neither lose nor gain. Rather, in order that the world might be, and be for itself, God renounced his own being, divesting himself of his deity - to receive it back from the Odyssey of time weighted with the chance harvest of unforeseeable temporal experience: transfigured or possibly even disfigured by it. In such self-for- feiture of divine integrity for the sake of unprejudiced becoming, no other foreknowledge can be admitted than that of possibilities which cosmic being offers in its own terms: to these, God com- mitted his cause in effacing himself for the world. And for aeons God's cause is safe in the slow hands of cosmic chance and probability - while all the time we may surmise a patient memory of the gyrations of matter to accumulate into an ever more expectant accompaniment of eternity to the labors of time - a hesitant emergence of transcendence from the opaque- ness of immanence. And then the first stirring of life --a new language of the world: and with it a tremendous quickening of concern in the eternal realm and a sudden leap in its growth toward recovery of its plenitude. It is the world-accident for which becoming deity had waited and with which its prodigal stake begins to show signs of being redeemed. From the infinite swell of feeling, sens- ing, striving and acting, which ever more varied and intense rises above the mute eddyings of matter, eternity gains strength, fill- ing with content after content of self-affirmation, and the awaken- ing God can first pronounce creation to be good. But note that with life together came death, and that mortality</page><page sequence="15">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 15 is the price which the new possibility of being had to pay for itself. If permanence were the point, life should not have started out in the first place, for in no possible form can it match the durability of inorganic bodies. It is essentially precarious and corruptible being, an adventure in mortality, obtaining from long-lasting matter on its terms - the short terms of metaboliz- ing organism - the borrowed, finite careers of individual selves. Yet it is precisely through the briefly snatched self-feeling, doing and suffering of finite individuals, with the pitch of awareness heightened by the very press of finitude, that the divine land- scape bursts into color and the deity comes to experience itself. If, then, mortality is the very condition of the separate selfhood which in the instinct of self-preservation shows itself so highly prized throughout the organic world, and if the yield of this mor- tality is the food of eternity, it is unreasonable to demand for its appointed executants, the self-affirming selves - immortality. The instinct of self-preservation indeed acknowledges this, for it implies the premise of extinction in its straining each time to ward it off for the nonce. Note also this that with life's innocence before the advent of knowledge God's cause cannot go wrong. Whatever variety evolution brings forth adds to the possibilities of feeling and acting, and thus enriches the self-experiencing of the ground of being. Every new dimension of world-response opened up in its course means another modality for God's trying out his hidden essence and discovering himself through the surprises of the world-adventure. And all its harvest of anxious toil, whether bright or dark, swells the transcendent treasure of temporally lived eternity. If this is true for the broadening spectrum of diversity as such, it is even truer for the heightening pitch and passion of life that go with the twin rise of perception and motil- ity in animals. The ever more sharpened keenness of appetite and fear, pleasure and pain, triumph and anguish, love and even cruelty - their very edge is the deity's gain. Their countless, yet never blunted incidence - hence the necessity of death and new birth - supplies the tempered essence from which the God- head reconstitutes itself. All this, evolution provides in the mere lavishness of its play and the sternness of its spur. Its creatures,</page><page sequence="16">16 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW by merely fulfilling themselves in pursuit of their lives, vindicate the divine venture. Even their suffering deepens the fullness of the symphony. Thus, this side of good and evil, God cannot lose in the great evolutionary game. Nor yet can he fully win in the shelter of its innocence, and a new expectancy grows in him in answer to the direction which the unconscious drift of immanence gradually takes. And then he trembles as the thrust of evolution, carried by its own momentum, passes the threshold where innocence ceases and an entirely new criterion of success and failure takes hold of the divine stake. The advent of man means the advent of knowl- edge and freedom, and with this supremely double-edged gift the innocence of the mere subject of self-fulfilling life has given way to the charge of responsibility under the disjunction of good and evil. To the promise and risk of this agency the divine cause, revealed at last, henceforth finds itself committed; and its issue trembles in the balance. The image of God, haltingly begun by the universe, for so long worked upon - and left undecided - in the wide and then narrowing spirals of pre-human life, passes with this last twist, and with a dramatic quickening of the move- ment, into man's precarious trust, to be completed, saved, or spoiled by what he will do to himself and the world. And in this awesome impact of his deeds on God's destiny, on the very com- plexion of eternal being, lies the immortality of man. With the appearance of man, transcendence awakened to itself and henceforth accompanies his doings with the bated breath of suspense, hoping and beckoning, rejoicing and grieving, approving and frowning - and, I daresay, making itself felt to him even while not intervening in the dynamics of his worldly scene: for can it not be that by the reflection of its own state as it wavers with the record of man, the transcendent casts light and shadow over the human landscape? VII Such is the tentative myth which I would like to believe 'true' - in the sense in which myth may happen to adumbrate a truth which of necessity is unknowable and even, in direct concepts,</page><page sequence="17">IMMORTALITY AND THE MODERN TEMPER 17 ineffable, yet which, by intimations to our deepest experience, lays claim upon our powers of giving indirect account of it in rev- ocable, anthropomorphic images. Metaphysics must make bold to use this, admittedly treacherous, medium at its risk; all the more in its present exile from the grounds of knowledge by criti- cal and positivist decree. I at least felt driven to this medium for once under the constraint of the unsought task; and let the insistence of its claim, which philosophy even in its helplessness must not deny, be my excuse - the excuse of my boldness and my stammering alike. To continue, then, in the same speculative vein, there follow certain ethical conclusions from the metaphysics which my myth has adumbrated. The first is the transcendent importance of our deeds, of how we live our lives. If man, as our tale has it, was created 'for' the image of God, rather than 'in' his image - if our lives become lines in the divine countenance: then our re- sponsibility is not defined in mundane terms alone, by which often it is inconsequential enough, but registers in a dimension where efficacy follows transcausal norms of inner essence. Fur- ther, as transcendence grows with the terribly ambiguous harvest of deeds, our impact on eternity is for good and for evil: we can build and we can destroy, we can heal and we can hurt, we can nourish and we can starve divinity, we can perfect and we can disfigure its image: and the scars of one are as enduring as the lustre of the other. Thus the immortality of our deeds is no cause for vain rejoicing - what most often ought to be wished for is rather their leaving no trace. But this is not granted: they have traced their line. Not, however, as the individual's destiny. The individual is by nature temporal, not eternal; and the person in particular, mortal trustee of an immortal cause, has the enjoy- ment of selfhood for the moment of time as the means by which eternity lays itself open to the decisions of time. As enacted in the medium of becoming, that is, as transient, are personal selves eternity's stake. Thus it is that in the irrepeatable occasions of finite lives the issue must be decided time and again: infinite duration would blunt the point of the issue and rob occasion of its urgent call. Nor, apart from this ontological consideration, does man have</page><page sequence="18">18 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a moral claim to the gift of immortality. Availing himself of the enjoyment of selfhood, he has endorsed the terms on which it is offered, and rather than having it as a title for more he owes thanks for the grant of existence as such - and for that which made it possible. For there is no necessity of there being a world at all. Why there is something rather than nothing - this un- answerable question of metaphysics should protect us from taking existence for an axiom, and its finiteness for a blemish on it or a curtailment of its right. Rather is the fact of existence the mystery of mysteries - which our myth has tried to reflect in a symbol. By foregoing its own inviolateness the eternal ground allowed the world to be. To this self-denial all creature owes its existence, and with it has received all there is to receive from beyond. Having given himself whole to the becoming world, God has no more to give: it is man's now to give to him. And he may give by seeing to it in the ways of his life that it does not happen, or not happen too often, and not on his account, that "it repented the Lord" 7 to have made the world. This may well be the secret of the 'thirty six righteous ones' whom, according to Jewish tra- dition, the world shall never lack s: that with the superior valency of good over evil, which, we hope, obtains in the non-causal logic of things there, their hidden holiness can outweigh countless guilt, redress the balance of a generation and secure the serenity of the invisible realm. But does that serenity, or its contrary, matter to our life on earth? Does it touch it? Let me join this question with another one, in conclusion of my groping journey. What about those who never could inscribe themselves in the Book of Life with deeds either good or evil, great or small, because their lives were cut off before they had their chance, or their humanity was destroyed in degradations most cruel and most thorough such as no human- ity can survive? I am thinking of the gassed and burnt children of Auschwitz, of the defaced, de-humanized phantoms of the camps, and of all the other, numberless victims of the other man- made holocausts of our time. Among men, their sufferings will soon be forgotten, and their names even sooner.

Are they, then, debarred from an im- mortality which even their tormentors and murderers obtain be- cause they could act - abominably, yet accountably, thus leav- ing their sinister mark on eternity's face? This I refuse to be- lieve. And this I like to believe: that there was weeping in the heights at the waste and despoilment of humanity; that a groan answered the rising shout of ignoble suffering, and wrath - the terrible wrong done to the reality and possibility of each life thus wantonly victimized, each one a thwarted attempt of God. "The voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground": should we not believe that the immense chorus of such cries that has risen up in our lifetime now hangs over our world as a dark, mournful, and accusing cloud? that eternity looks down upon us with a frown, wounded itself and perturbed in its depths? - And might we not even feel it? If the secret sympathy that con- nects our being with the transcendent condition works both ways (as in some manner it must, or else there would not even be that inward testimony for us to invoke on which our whole case for the eternal was grounded), then there will always be some reso- nance to that condition in ours - sometimes felt, though mostly not, and presently felt, perhaps, in a general malaise, in the pro- found distemper of the contemporary mind. Things human do not prosper under our hands. Happiness eludes our pursuit, and meaning mocks our desperate need. Could it not be that, super- induced upon the many-levelled, but never completely explaining causes from within our historical existence, also the disturbance of the transcendent order which we have caused thus reverberates in the spiritual mood of men - and thus the modern temper para- doxically might itself reflect the immortality which it disowns? It would be fitting - more I dare not say - if the slaughtered had that share in immortality, and on their account a great effort were asked of those alive to lift the shadow from our brow and gain for those after us a new chance of serenity by restoring it to the invisible world. But even if not their shadow, certainly the shadow of the Bomb is there to remind us that the image of God is in danger as never before, and on most unequivocal, terrestrial terms. That in these</page><page sequence="20">20 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW terms an eternal issue is at stake together with the temporal one - this aspect of our responsibility can be our guard against the temptation of fatalistic acquiescence or the worse treason of aprds nous le deluge. We literally hold in our faltering hands the future of the divine adventure and must not fail Him, even if we would fail ourselves. Thus in the dim light at the end of our wandering we may dis- cern a twofold responsibility of man: one in terms of worldly causality, by which the effect of his deed extends for some greater or shorter length into a future where it eventually dissipates; and a simultaneous one in terms of its impact on the eternal realm, where it never dissipates. The one, with our limited foresight and the complexity of worldly things, is much at the mercy of luck and chance; the other goes by knowable norms which, in the Bible's words,9 are not far from our hearts. There might even be, as I indicated, a third dimension to our responsibility in terms of the impalpably reciprocal way in which Eternity, without in- tervening in the physical course of things, will communicate its spiritual state as a pervading mood to a generation which will have to live with it. But the first two are more than enough to summon us to our task. Although the hereafter is not ours, nor eternal recurrence of the here, we can have immortality at heart when in our brief span we serve our threatened mortal affairs and help the suffer- ing immortal God. 9 Deut. 30:14.</page></plain_text>
