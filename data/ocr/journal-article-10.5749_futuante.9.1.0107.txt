When the Venetians sacked Constantinople during the  crusade of 1204, many of the relics from the Church of the Holy  Apostles were dispersed in the West. Since its establishment  as a colony of the Byzantine Empire in the fifth century, Venice  had a tenuous relationship with Constantinople as subject,  enemy, and trading partner. As Venice prepared to mount a  Crusade to Constantinople in 1464, this time against the Ot- tomans, the Republic mourned the destruction of the church.  Following the destruction of the Church of the Holy Apostles,  the image of the church became increasingly politicized.  This article explores the shaping of the biography of the  Church of Holy Apostles as the Ottomans supplanted Byzantine  hegemony in Constantinople and as Venice positioned itself  as Byzantium’s worthy heir rather than its rival. In his compen- dious Realms of Memory, Pierre Nora traced the ontology of  places that became topoi for French identity through political  and historical change. He defined a “place of memory” as any  significant entity, whether material or nonmaterial in nature,  that by dint of human will or the work of time has become a  symbolic element of the memorial heritage of any community.3  Drawing on Nora’s work, I argue that the Church of the Holy  Apostles was reproduced in Venice through traces of its relics  and architectural forms as the Republic again redefined their  relationship with the Byzantine Empire, claiming inheritance  over its patrimony.  Byzantine descriptions of the Holy Apostles have enabled  scholars to reconstruct the plan and elevation of the church.  Writing around 1200, Nicholas Mesarites described how the  builders “constructed circular wheels, extending to them  Future Anterior Volume IX, Number 1 four well-fi tting curves called slings [pendentives]; and they  Summer 2012 [the wheels] likewise received five domes; but the architect  107 </page> <page sequence="3"> 2.

From accounts of  its cruciform plan, five domes, and mosaic decoration many  scholars have argued that the Holy Apostles served as the prin- cipal prototype for the basilica of San Marco in Venice.6 Built  during the ninth century and rebuilt twice before the twelfth  century, San Marco was founded to accommodate the relics of  St. Mark the Evangelist after they were taken by the  Venetians  108 </page> <page sequence="4"> from Alexandria in the ninth century. As a newly formed   Republic at the time of the ninth- century theft of St. Mark from  Alexandria, the relics of one of the gospel’s authors offered  Venice credibility as a divinely ordained Republic, worthy of its  prosperity. As the emperors guarded the relics of the apostles  at the Church of the Holy Apostles, the elected figurehead  leader of Venice, the doge, would oversee the relics of Mark the  Evangelist, a saint considered to be an apostle, at his titular  basilica.  Richard Krautheimer proposed that Greek architects,  who appropriated the general plan and elevation of the Holy   Apostles, designed the basilica of San Marco while later schol- ars emphasized the political affiliation embodied by the two  structures.7 According to Juergen Schultz, San Marco not only  copied the footprint and the profile of the Church of the Holy  Apostles, but after the Crusade of 1204, when objects spoliated  from Constantinople, including columns, porphyry, and the four  bronze horses were incorporated into the façade of the  basilica  in Venice, the Piazza San Marco reproduced the appearance of  the Hippodrome of Constantinople.8 The entire ducal complex  in Venice would have pointed to Roman imperial and Chris- tian authority at a time when Venice forcefully claimed inde- pendence from the rule of Byzantium. More recently, Marina  Falla Castelfranchi specified that the third construction of the  basilica of San Marco in the eleventh century drew on the Holy  Apostles to express an allegiance to the Byzantine emperors at  a time when Venice’s neighbor to the north, Aquileia, tried to  assert its power over the Italian peninsula.9  Centuries later, as the Eastern Empire receded, Sultan  Mehmet’s mosque also drew on forms associated with the  Byzantine Empire. The mosque has undergone extensive reno- vations due to earthquake damage, but based on early views of  Istanbul, a large central dome supported by subsidiary domes  around the circumference stood as its most salient feature in  the cityscape. In its massing of domes to support the central  core, Mehmet’s mosque shared a general plan and elevation  with descriptions of the two principal churches of the earlier  emperors in Constantinople, the seat of the Bishop, the Hagia  Sophia and the Holy Apostles.10 Mehmet’s building campaign  at the site of the Holy Apostles related to other interventions  undertaken by the Sultan in the stratigraphy of imperial Greek  sites. Soon after he assumed power, Mehmet II converted both  the Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, into mosques.11 Though  its accuracy cannot be confirmed, an inscription on the portal  of the mosque reads that it was begun on February 21, 1463,  around the time that Venice and its allies prepared a declara- tion of war against the Ottomans.12 Given its significance as  a locus of imperial identity, the Sultan’s choice of the Holy  109 </page> <page sequence="5"> 3.

An Ottoman declaration on the construction of churches  in Constantinople demonstrates the nuanced attitudes toward   assertions of Christian identity in the city. The policy states,  “We shall not try to turn their churches into mosques, but they  are not to build any new churches.”13 By silencing the bells of  the churches—civic signs of autonomy—the Ottomans struck  the sounds of Christianity from the aural landscape of the city.  The prevention of further building was meant to decrease the  number of monumental signs of Christianity in the city. Records  of the conversion of Constantinople into an Ottoman city sug- gest that the Ottomans engaged in what Jas Elsner refers to  as “the public gesture of forgetting” in his study of the pres- ervation of monuments in ancient Rome subject to vandalism  through damnatio memoriae.14  In her recent book on the transformation of Constantinople  into an Ottoman city, Çig ̆dem Kafescioglu contends that the  appropriation of the site of the Holy Apostles for Sultan Mehmet  II’s külliye was likely calculated as an act of aggression against  Byzantine imperial identity. However, Kafescioglu emphasizes  that several other factors also contributed to the destruction of  the Church and the location of the Mosque.15 The Church of the  Holy Apostles may not have been demolished as an act of politi- cal hostility towards the Byzantine Empire, but it signaled trans- formation and reconstruction. In 1420 Cristoforo  Buondelmonti  110 </page> <page sequence="6"> 4.

Thus, when the  builders of the Fatih Mosque incorporated columns of verde  antica and granite from the Holy Apostles into the hospice of  the mosque complex, they may have been taking advantage of  the quarry made available by the compromised church.17  Despite the condition of the church by the end of the fif- teenth century, Mehmet’s courtiers colored the construction of  his mosque in the hues of rivalry in descriptions of Mehmet’s  capture of Constantinople. Kritovoulos, a Greek working in the  service of the Ottomans soon after 1453, wrote that “The Sultan  himself selected the best site in the middle of the city and  commanded them to build a Mosque which in height, beauty,  and size should compete with the largest and finest temples  already existing there.”18 An Ottoman ambassador, Tursun Beg,  similarly noted that the Mosque was designed to surpass the  monuments erected by the Byzantine emperors in Constanti- nople: “And he built a Great Mosque based on the design of  Ayasofya, which not only encompassed all the arts of Ayasofya,  but in addition, incorporated modern features constituting a  fresh new idiom unequalled in beauty.”19 The spared Hagia  Sophia remained as a technical paradigm for the Fatih Mosque  complex with its larger dome, built on a prodigious scale in a  more elevated area of the Constantinople to indicate Mehmet’s  111 </page> <page sequence="7"> 5.

Tursun Beg described the Hagia Sophia in soaring tones,  but his exposition also advances a broader theory of the struc- ture as a meditation on the transience of the physical fabric  of Constantinople. He declares that the mosque’s builders  surpassed Byzantine architecture by employing superior tech- nical skills. What a dome, that vies in rank with the nine spheres of  heaven! In this work a perfect master displayed the whole  of the architectural science. Mehmet II, having looked  upon the strange and wondrous images and adornments  that were on the concave inner surface, deigned to climb  up to the dome. When he saw the dependent buildings  of this mighty structure fallen in ruin, he thought of the  impermanence and instability of this world, and of its  ultimate destruction.20 As tangible proof of his growing clout, Mehmet was able to  transform the great and intricate monuments of the Byzan- tine Empire by reducing them to rubble. In extolling Mehmet  through his buildings, Beg drew on Byzantine accounts that  promoted the grandiosity of the churches built by the Eastern  emperors. Both Constantine of Rhodes in the tenth century  and Mesarites in about 1200 portray the Holy Apostles as hav- ing surpassed human building capabilities. In one passage,  Mesarites described the domes of the church, “As if towering  giants had come forth and extended their hands into the air,  112 </page> <page sequence="8"> weaving together fingers.”21 These descriptions of an awe-  inspiring building with an intricate, anthropomorphic, vaulting  system may have served to restore dignity to the Holy Apostles  after years of neglect since its patronage by the early emperors.  That later Ottoman writers similarly promoted the technological  feats of Byzantine building demonstrates the role of monu- ments in shaping the rhetoric of appropriation.  While many Ottoman court historians described Mehmet’s  takeover and destruction of significant Byzantine monuments  to demonstrate his authority through conquest, Western mer- chants and envoys stationed in Constantinople recorded their  impressions of the physical fabric of the city as a rally cry to  war. Accounts of the conquest of Constantinople by Westerners  often mourned the loss of Byzantine buildings as a synecdoche  for the dismantling of Byzantine rule by the Ottoman Turks.  One elegy, written by a Venetian, lamented the conversion of  the Hagia Sophia into a mosque before he beseeched Justinian  and his wife Theodora to witness what had become of the Holy  Apostles. “A great church, the great cry, The Apostles. With a  high voice, it says, O Empress Theodora, Come and See your  sacred edifice. I do not believe I have ever thought it would  come to this.”22 Passages like this, linking the city’s ecclesiasti- cal monuments to the beginning of the Eastern Empire and an  embrace of Christianity, confirms an incipient belief in Susan  Stewart’s contention that “writing promises . . . the immortality  of the material world.”23 Accounts of the destruction of Byzan- tine architecture by Mehmet’s courtiers and Westerners alike,  reify the infrastructure of the city as a representation rather  than as a functional monument.  Many Western writers demonstrated familiarity with the  Holy Apostles as a reliquary and the general significance of  relics in Constantinople. In his autobiographical Commen- taries, written before his death in 1464, Pope Pius II alluded  to spoliation of the Holy Apostles in his imagined reaction to  the conquest by Emperor Constantine, the founder of the city.  He wrote, “I have been troubled to learn that the city you bade  me to found, the most holy city of Christendom, second only  to Rome, has been occupied by the satellites of Mehmet. The  famous temples where your name was praised have been pol- luted . . . the sepulchers of my successors destroyed, the most  holy relics have been thrown to the dogs.”24 Mehmet’s admirer,  Kritovoulos, similarly described “things they threw in dishonor  on the ground—ikons and reliquaries and other objects from  the churches.”25  Testimonies about the desecration of Byzantine archi- tecture as casualties of war coincided with Pope Pius II’s  papal proclamation in 1462 that prohibited the despoliation  of ancient monuments for construction material in order that  113 </page> <page sequence="9"> “our venerable city be preserved in its dignity and splendor.”26  The ruins of ancient Rome stood as a sign of decay, but the  pope promoted the archaeological expeditions that were  becoming popular in humanist circles as a form of ancient  learning.27 According to the pope, cohabitating with ancient  “buildings permitted us to better perceive the fragility of  human affairs,” a sentiment that must have resonated with   Europeans absorbing accounts of the fall of Constantinople  and debating whether to rescue the physical remains of the  East from the Ottomans.  As the Ottomans gained territory around the Mediterra- nean during the mid-fi fteenth century, theologians, politicians,  and exiles in the West debated an appropriate response to  the conquest and the threat it posed to the preservation of  symbolic monuments of Constantinople. Venetian merchants  with trading interests in the East were not as eager to break  diplomatic ties with the Ottoman Turks as others, like the Greek  émigrés, who were anxious about the fate of their cultural patri- mony. The Venetian Senate temporized when it came to dealing  with the Sultan. In 1459, when Pius II announced his plans for  a Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land and Constantinople, Venice  prohibited the papal congress from meeting in its territory for  fear that pro- Crusade sentiment would jeopardize Venetian  business interests across the Adriatic.28 Venice’s entry into war  and its eventual consent to the Crusade a year later in 1464  represented a notable change in policy after territory in the  Aegean and along the Dalmatian coast had been conquered by  the Ottomans.  The descriptions of ruins in Constantinople were comple- mented by the removal of sacred property to the West, includ- ing relics and manuscripts, with Venice serving as the principal  beneficiary. As the Venetian senate debated a declaration of  war on Mehmet, it ordered its soldiers to procure the head of  St. George from Istanbul.29 The acquisition of St. George’s relics  provided a conspicuous analogy to the current crisis in Venice,  where in the fifteenth century, the West saw itself allegori- cally as a modern-d ay St. George, vanquishing the dangerous  dragon as an emblem of the Ottoman Empire.30 With the relics  of George safely housed in Venice, the Republic could explicitly  align the saint’s struggle with its own against the Turks.  When the Fatih Mosque was under construction in the  early 1460s, some of the relics of the principal saints associ- ated with the Church of the Holy Apostles reemerged in the  West. There are conflicting reports about the trajectory of many  of the relics held at the Holy Apostles, particularly after the  Venetians sacked the city during the Fourth Crusade of 1204.  The Venetians returned to Europe with many precious items  spoliated from Constantinople, then under Byzantine rule.  114 </page> <page sequence="10"> After 1204, the Amalfi Cathedral in southern Italy laid claim  to the head of St. Andrew—considered the first patriarch of  the Eastern Church and one of the principal saints displayed  at the Church of the Holy Apostles—while pilgrims described  seeing a part of the saint’s head in the church of St. George  of Mangana in Constantinople. However, the dominant story  surrounding Andrew’s remains is found in the autobiographical  Commentaries by Pope Pius II, where he recounts the negotia- tions to translate the head of Andrew to Rome from the saint’s  birthplace of Peloponnesus soon after it fell to the Ottomans in  1460. Andrew’s head was processed to the Pope on its arrival  in Rome in a highly choreographed ceremony that emulated  the Adventus ceremonies in Constantinople. The procession  culminated in an anti- Turkish speech by the Greek Cardinal  Bessarion, who proffered the relic to point out the vulnerabil- ity of other holy objects scattered throughout Ottoman- held  territory.31 The Cardinal told his listeners that St. Andrew’s  head  itself had spoken and asked the Pope to “destroy the  barbarians and defend the church,” as his brother, St. Peter,  would have wanted.32 Because Andrew was considered the first  emperor in the East, the translation of Andrew’s relics symboli- cally unified the Latin and the Eastern Church as Bessarion  made an appeal to the spiritual head of the Latin Church, the  pope, by invoking his predecessor, Peter.  The account of Andrew’s entrance into Rome coincided  with an attempt to translate to Venice the relics believed to  have belonged to St. Luke the Evangelist, another saint promi- nently displayed at the Holy Apostles.33 In 1463, the leader  of Venice, Doge Cristoforo Moro, arranged for the removal of  an arm believed to be St. Luke the Evangelist to Venice from  an area under the threat of Turkish control. While Mehmet  appropriated the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles as an  emblem of his authority over Byzantium, the Venetian doge  began to embrace the receding Empire as a part of Venetian  history. He installed what he advertised as the relics of St. Luke  the Evangelist in the church of San Giobbe, a small church that  he had been supporting at least since the 1450s, before he  was Doge.  The Paduans mounted a challenge to the authenticity of  the Venetians’ claim to the torso of St. Luke the Evangelist for  they laid claim to the same body part. In his decision, the emis- sary of the pope, Cardinal Bessarion, adjudicated in favor of  Venice over the identification of the relic. Bessarion may have  authenticated the relic of St. Luke in favor of Venice as a strate- gic move to secure the doge’s commitment to participate in the  Crusade against the Turks as they took over Bessarion’s native  Greece. However, the papacy quickly realized that the ruling in  favor of Venice negated the identity of the attribution of a head  115 </page> <page sequence="11"> in the Vatican to Luke the Evangelist, which was believed to  have formed a perfect fit with the body in Padua. Despite his  Venetian pedigree, Pope Paul II reversed Bessarion’s decision,  and the relic at San Giobbe was identified as belonging to  St. Luke of Stiris.34 The friars at San Giobbe, however, remained  intransigent about the original attribution: in 1525, a pilgrim en  route to the Holy Land had gone to San Giobbe, where he was  shown “the entire body of St. Luke the Evangelist.”35  As the Venetian Republic prepared to declare war on the  Ottomans in 1463, the presence of yet another evangelist in  Venice, this time Luke, would promote the idea that the city  was a safe haven for the authors of the gospels and property  sacred to Christians. Neither the relics of Andrew nor Luke that  were imported onto the Italian peninsula could be securely  linked to those relics that were once at the Holy Apostles, but  the two forces allied against the Ottomans, the Venetian doge  and the pope, both claimed to possess relics of saints who had  been associated with the Church of the Holy Apostles as they  prepared to crusade. As Patrick Geary and Thomas Dale have  argued, relics were often promoted during the middle ages and  the Renaissance as sacred objects that offered uncontested   political legitimacy.36 The relics served as indices of a Byzan- tine imperial power that was now contested by Ottomans.  The Venetians had political motive to preserve the iden- tification of the relics as Luke the Evangelist, for the acquisi- tion of an evangelist’s relics recalled one of the foundational  events of Venetian sovereignty: the narrative of the journey  of St. Mark’s relics from Alexandria to the lagoon in the ninth  century.37 When Mark’s relics arrived from Alexandria, Venice  was under the control of the Byzantine Empire, but it was in the  process of instituting an elected leader, the doge, to establish  itself as an independent power. The bishop led the relics of  Mark in a procession to San Teodoro, the private chapel of  the doge, who vowed to build a reliquary church for St. Mark  nearby. When he installed St. Luke’s relics at San Giobbe in  the fifteenth century, it seems that Doge Moro tried to create a  similar alliance between the small church that he patronized on  the outskirts of Venice and San Marco. The half- length reliefs  of the apostles that line the intrados of the high altar chapel of  San Giobbe point to the importance placed on the followers of  Christ at the church.  Stylistically, there are fundamental similarities between  the San Marco and San Giobbe. San Giobbe is covered by a  low dome on pendentives, pierced by eight deep windows, like  the dome of San Marco. Given that the patron of San Giobbe,  Moro, was a doge, who had just choreographed the transla- tion of St. Luke the Evangelist’s relics to the church, the dome  was likely conceived to create an alliance with San Marco as an  116 </page> <page sequence="12"> 6.

By drawing on the design motifs  Photograph by author. of San Marco, the dome profile of San Giobbe also coopted  an  architectural and iconographical vocabulary associated  with the Byzantine Empire. Though small, the roundel of God  the  Father that marks the summit of the dome of San Giobbe  evokes descriptions of the mosaic of the  Pantocrator in the Holy  Apostles. It suggests that the designers of San Giobbe drew not  only on Byzantine decorative convention but ekphrases that  posited domes as metaphors of the heavenly realm.  The motif of the low dome on pendentives appeared in a  spate of small centrally planned churches built in Venice during  the late fifteenth century. A few of these churches, includ- ing San Giovanni Crisostomo and Santa Maria Formosa, were  heavily reconstructed in the late fifteenth century after they  had been destroyed by fires in the mid- 1470s.38 The architect of  both churches, Mauro Codussi, may have based his designs on  117 </page> <page sequence="13"> 6a.

In December 1499, a “madonna Grecha” was  commissioned for San Giovanni Crisostomo.40 None of the sup- porters or patrons of the church were known to have personally  traveled to the East, but it seems that in their designs they  were promoting the notion of a “Greek” style as Byzantine  culture in the East was perceived to be under threat.  Though these smaller Venetian churches shared design  motifs with the basilica of San Marco, their appearance soon  after reports of the desecration of the Constantinople circu- lated in Venice can also be attributed to the rhetoric that was  redefining the Republic’s understanding of its relationship  to Byzantium. When the Venetians sacked Constantinople  in 1204, they famously returned to Venice with spoils from  118 </page> <page sequence="14"> 7.

Photograph by author. Because many of the objects spoliated were used to deco- rate San Marco, the materials became signifiers of Venetian  cultural heritage, linking Venice’s victory to the claim of St.  Mark’s relics. Sacred objects that once shaped the authority  of the Byzantine Empire were stolen by the Venetians as a sign  of  hegemony and affixed onto the surfaces of San Marco. In  contrast to the Venetian spoliation of Constantinople in 1204,  relics and architectural forms appropriated as salvage from the  Turks were propped up as expressions of a Byzantine Golden  Age. Sacred objects and architectural forms associated with  the East promoted anti- Turkish sentiment, eclipsing the more  nuanced political and economic tensions that had defined the  relationship between the former Constantinople and the Vene- tian Republic.  In 1468, Cardinal Bessarion donated several hundred  of his Greek and Latin manuscripts to the Republic from his  endangered homeland and a reliquary containing a relic of the  True Cross, to Venice.41 The relic had been given to Bessarion as  a gift by Gregory, the patriarch of Constantinople, when he died  in Italy in 1459. In a letter to the doge explaining his regifting  of the items to Venice, Bessarion referred to the Republic as  “another Byzantium,” suggesting that Venice was a worthy in- heritor of his cultural patrimony.42 An inscription on Bessarion’s  relic of the True Cross mentions Irene, niece of the Byzantine  emperor, initiating an imperial chain back to Constantine and  119 </page> <page sequence="15"> 8.

Venice became the site  where the rich cultural heritage of Byzantium could be memori- alized, resurrected, and celebrated. The translation of objects  and architectural forms to the West aided in the construction  of a more harmonious and seamless history between Venice  and Byzantium, glossing over the divisions that had actually  defined the relationship between the two powers for almost a  thousand years.
