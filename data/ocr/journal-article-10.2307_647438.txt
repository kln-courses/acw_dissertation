<plain_text><page sequence="1">social body and icon of the person: a symbolic analysis of shell money among the Wodani, western highlands of Irian Jaya STEPHANE BRETON-Ecole des hautes 6tudes en sciences sociales, Paris A shell belonging to the species Cyprea moneta, commonly referred to as a cowry, is used by the Wodani of Irian Jaya for all sorts of ritual and economic transactions.' In their universe, where the existence of the sea is unknown, the kipe (cowry) is the only object not of human creation that can be found no place other than in human hands. They say that shel s and humans, from the very beginning, have always been together: "Men arrived, kipe arrived." Among all the objects they know, there is no other whose existence is strictly social. The kipe is used as a means of payment in all kinds of exchanges, from bridewealth and blood price to compensation for ritual services, as well as more mundane transactions such as the purchase of pigs, salt, manufactured objects, and sometimes even labor.2 Being a general medium of exchange-to a point rarely attained by traditional currencies-it is money in the strictest sense. In this article, however, my aim is to show that the economic function of the kipe is symbolically determined by its agency in the reproduction of human life and society. Thus, as a ritual and symbolic instrument, the shell money fulfills its role as a standard of value (see Godelier 1996). The Wodani live on the northern watershed of the western highlands of the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, the western half of the island of New Guinea. They inhabit a sparsely populated area of the Paniai regency and are a typical highland people; they live as localized exogamous totemic patricians, raising pigs and cultivating taro and sweet potato. Their immediate neighbors to the south-the Kapauku/Ekagi (Pospisil 1958, 1963a, 1963b) and Moni (van Nunen 1973), who speak languages of the same family (Larson and Larson 1972; Wurm 1982:151-153) and share with the Wodani many cultural traits-have been known to the The Wodani of Irian Jaya describe shell money as an immortal person, endowed with a human anatomy. In the context of matrimonial and homicide compensa- tions, shell money pays for the different parts and organs of the person, thus symbolically transforming the bride or the victim into a composite body. Each part is ascribed to one or the other parent's procreative agency. The patrilineal organs are compensated for with the most valued shells. By fragmenting the person into hierarchized elements, the payment does not produce individual pieces but social components, distributed among patrilineal clan members in monetary form. In payments, shells are said to be eaten by their recipients, so that the clan depleted by the loss of a daughter or a son is symbolically reconstituted. The clan is represented by payments as a totality made out of persons' parts, as a pool of patrilineal organs. Deconstructing persons to form a social whole and recycling elements of this whole to produce the person, shell money is an instrument of social reproduction at the same time as it is the symbol of the perpetuity of the clan body.

This is not the case of the Wodani, whose integration within Irian Jaya began in the 1980s and whose population of approximately 4,000 has been only partially converted to Christianity by Irianese pastors. Indonesian paper money and modern commodities have made few inroads among the non-Christian clans. The ritual life and the elaborate shell money complex are still intact in some of the traditional clans, among whom I conducted the research reported here. monetary symbolism In the eyes of the Wodani, each shell is an individual, a unique piece in its own right.3 The kipe is a "person" and is said to possess a human anatomy. Although it bears no resemblance whatsoever to the human body, it is endowed with a "nose" (the top of the shell), "anus" (its bottom), "thighs" (its inferior lateral protuberances), and "skin" (the enamel on whose surface the blackened chips form "eyes"), as well as a "mouth" (the "tooth"-edged opening made by cutting off the bulge of the shell, allowing the circumvoluted spine, known as the "backbone," to be seen inside).4 One of the three numeral classifiers reserved for shell money means "skin." The open face is the exclusive focus of interest: the kipe is never turned over for the other side to be inspected. This figurative anatomy leaves no place for genital organs: the shell's mouth is immediately bordered by its nose and anus. Shell money is generic masculine wealth, whose gender by default need not be specified. Still, shell money classes are said to be either male or female, depending on their shape: masculinity symbolically encompasses both genders. The kipe is thus a very particular person, at once incomplete and described on the basis of a peculiar convention, as nothing in the actual shape of the shell justifies a comparison with the human body.5 For the Wodani, the anthropomorphism of the cowry is knowingly fictitious, as if the kipe were a concrete symbol pretending to be an icon. Kipe is also said to be a "living person," which is why it is forbidden to recut the mouth of a shell to make it look better; to do so is unthinkable, just as it would be, say the Wodani, to gash someone's lips with a bamboo knife. This symbolic human body is the object of attentive cosmetic care.6 Before one displays the shell, its mouth is beautified by dusting it with yellow mushroom spores, and the line of black gum that borders the mouth is carefully polished. The extraction and display of the shell involves a great deal of interest and respect. The kipe is slid on its large side-its "ass"-into the tubular cocoon of a butterfly of the Psychidae family. The cocoon is the natural shelter of a white larva, which belongs to a generic class comprising all reptiles and worms and also mockingly designating the penis of a young boy. The cocoon bristles with splinters of wood protecting the larva, which are torn off when the cocoon is used for holding a shell; women wear it "raw," intact, on their necklaces.7 The kipe is extracted by letting it slip out on its nose, in other words, head first and downward-like a newborn baby, it seems. I would argue that this sheath has a uterine symbolic quality. The shell is lodged within it like a penis or a child. Men decorate the cocoon by attaching hunting trophies to it, such as the tail of a marsupial known as the Long-fingered Triok.8 Women are prohibited to eat the flesh of this marsupial, which is believed to cause cutaneous ulcers, or the Triok's liver and heart, which would harm the taro. The marsupial's tutelary spirit is Agimba, an avatar of Yamba, a male spirit who is often mentioned in connection with monetary matters. The scrotum of the Weyland Ringtail may also be attached to the cocoon.9 The cocoon is placed inside a small bag made out of bark string, which is itself tightly fitted with other shells in a larger purse and is often carried in the net bag of the owner's wife, although she is not allowed to use the shells it contains. The woman's net bag, which she also uses to carry a child or food, is compared to the womb. Thus women are the carriers of men's wealth, in the same way as the uterine cocoon is the container of the shell. The large money bag also holds the umbilical cord or the excised finger of the owner's shell money 559</page><page sequence="3">child-tokens of the child's existence,10 which the father hides in the bark of a hoop-pine after his child has grown up.1' The tutelary spirit of this majestic tree is Yamba, or one of his numerous avatars, protectors of shell money as well as children. It also happens that pieces of marsupial fur or the tip of a particular snake's tail are put into the money pouch; women are strictly forbidden to eat this snake, lest it cause fetal deformities or discoloration of the child's skin. A "white skin" is a sign of sickness, alluding to the lunar symbolism of the coiled snake.'2 The moon is a male celestial body which is said to be women's lover and is held responsible for menstrual bleeding. The decorations attached to the kipe involve a symbolism both male and dangerous to women. In this context, color denotes specific bodily qualities for humans and shells, suggesting that shell money represents a particular inversion of the human person. Humans are naturally black; fair skin is considered ill-fated and is a cause of worry. During a wake, for example, when the corpse's skin begins to peel, revealing the white dermis beneath, the laceration is quickly covered over with ground charcoal. In a certain sense, beneath the skin of the living lies its dead self-promised to the eternal existence of a ghost. And nothing resembles the dead more than white people. White is the color normally associated with the body's interior, beneath the black surface. When a person has been wounded, bleedings are a means of both warding off infection and determining whether it has been caused by a spirit's attack. When the lesion caused by the bamboo knife used for the bleeding is "black" (when blood vessels have been cut), the wound is said to be caused by a spirit-Tege for instance; when the lesion is "white," it is said to be healthy, in which case no spirit is to be blamed. Some wounds are caused by spirits, others not. Bleedings are a practice both therapeutic and divinatory, allowing people to determine the cause of the wound by interpreting the color of the flesh inside. A healthy body is white inside and dark outside. But in shell money, these colors are inverted: its skin is white and the mouth-covered with resin and notched with dark-colored chips-reveals a blackish cavity. In the exorcism of the spirit Bayato, an avatar of Yamba well versed in things monetary and the rival of Tege (the destroyer and the killer, often blamed for accidents, death, and wounds), the shaman strips the bark from a branch of a Cryptocarya tree, laying bare the white of the wood, and asks the spirit to restore order into the lives of humans, to whiten them and the place where they live, and to allow them to "see" shells and game. Along similar lines, one must not show or look at a kipe except in full daylight. The exorcism of Tege, on the other hand, is often conducted at night in order to keep the domestic pigs from his voracious appetite.'3 His responsibility in a wound is determined by the dark color of the bleedings. The contrast between black and white, at play between the surface and the inside of the body, denotes an opposition between darkness and light, sickness and health, destruction and production, malevolence and propitious enterprises, mortality and immortality. The "body" of the kipe-white on the outside and dark on the inside-testifies in some sense to the fact that it is destined for immortality. In the same way, Europeans, whose white skin seems to the Wodani to protect them from ulcers and disease and who express horror at dirt and soot, are evidently not subject to death and are considered human only to a very limited extent. The highly esteemed yellow spots on the shell's enamel are referred to by comparison with the parade feathers of the Macgregor Bowerbird which are sometimes used to decorate the shell sheath and which women customarily suspend from their necklaces.'4 The shells, which are held and traded by men in order to obtain wives, thus have qualities that establish a relation of proximity between the masculine and feminine realms. In order to attract a female, the male Macgregor Bowerbird-like all the species of the same family-builds a construction out of twigs, lining it with colored fruits, beetle shells, seeds, and shiny pebbles-"like so many pieces of shell money," remark the Wodani. The bower where this nuptial parade takes place is described as a replica of the dance house devoted to the spirit Yamba, where young men try to win the heart of a bride. When he puts an end to the long season of dance that he sponsored, 560 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="4">the "big-man" sacrifices pigs and sells them for shells. The purpose of the dance house may be said to be the conversion of pork into money and of bachelors into genitors.15 The Macgregor Bowerbird evokes both sexual and financial ventures-two different universes brought together through monetary play. The animal symbolism Wodani associate with kipe denotes a male dimension. It is sometimes the object of food prohibitions Wodani explain in terms of risks to female fecundity, both agricultural and sexual. The ornaments mentioned above are added not only to the cowry sheath but also to women's necklaces. In other words, women and shells display the same decora- tions.'6 This shows that they stand in a relation of equivalence. These ornaments represent a danger for women and a promise of multiplication for the shells. For instance, a woman would decorate her neck with the last phalanx of a finger cut off her hand if her child dies very young; but it is the finger of a living child that is used to decorate the money bag, as I have said. With respect to their corresponding fineries, women and shells stand in a symmetrical position. The fineries are to women what the shells are to men. Kipe are a detached aspect of masculine identity (see Strathern 1984, 1988). Wodani categorize cowries in some 20 hierarchized classes defined by subtle morphological criteria.17 Each class corresponds to an approximate value,18 but the price of a shell ultimately rests on its anatomical traits, the quality of the polish or hue of the enamel, and the shell's age and renown. Aesthetic judgments sustain the space for interpretation and debate as to the shell's value, as it complicates an otherwise uncontroversial cosmological vocabulary (Clark 1991:328) with personal idiosyncratic preferences or expertise. Personal predilection for specific traits, given forms, or characteristics is possible only because of the great individuali- zation of the shells.'9 There is also a certain degree of morphological differentiation on a regional basis, the cowries having currency with one tribe not necessarily being accepted among another. For instance, the Moni of the Dugindoga and the Dani of llaga prefer smaller and narrower shells, whose origin is immediately recognizable by the Wodani. Value is attributed to the shell's wear, testimony to all the transactions in which it has been involved. A beautiful kipe is said to be "ripe"; its bulbous, almost split-open body is appreci- ated.20 Preference is given to a long nose, ample thighs, and a large mouth with rough, unsymmetrical contours, whose chipped edges have been well worn by use. It is an aesthetic unrelated to notions of symmetry and balance, borrowing its features from the degradation of bodies and fruits, from an excessive and exhausted fecundity-as Frederick Damon (1990:1 72) has noted with regard to the aesthetics of the garden in Woodlark, where order is defeated by abundance. The most precious shells, forming a large fraction of the currencies in circulation-which amount to several thousand pieces-share with humans the right to bear their own name.21 But the onomastic of shell money is governed by a specific poetic style.22 Here, the speculation on origin replaces the uncertainty of the source with the banality of a place. Far from the extraordinary scatology that predominates in people's names-destined to discourage the spirits' aggression-shell names often refer to the mystical origin of an indeterminate object, sometimes a fruit or a stone, lodged in the hollow of some foliage, on the branch of a tree, or in a water hole. Shell money is by definition a found object. As Roy Wagner (1978:9) points out, how could it possibly have an origin or a source, since its very principle is to have always been passed on by someone else? Thanks to their peripheral location, the Wodani found themselves completely exempt from the collapse of the traditional monetary system that affected the people of the western highlands of Irian Jaya, particularly the Kapauku/Ekagi (Dubbeldam 1964; Giay 1995:38-40; Pospisil 1963a:311), due to the inflation brought about by the great number of low-value shells introduced by missionaries and the colonial administration. In the last decades, they even benefited from this decline by becoming the recipients of high-quality cowries recycled into shell money 561</page><page sequence="5">their economy by their neighbors. In the same way as for the Wola of Papua New Guinea (Sillitoe 1979:150-160), where shell money was protected from depreciation by its symbolic and aesthetic qualities, the increase in beautiful kipe did not lead so much to their devaluation as to the multiplication of exchanges, with the result that shell money is stronger now than it ever was (Breton 1999a). The fact that there is now an abundance, even an excess, of good quality shells, according to an old informant, has put a great strain on the supply of pigs. The cowries want to "eat" the pigs' souls, he says. These are not just the lamentations of an old man regretting a time of plenty that never was but, rather, a way of saying that the multiplication of the means of exchange has led to an acceleration of the transactions and consequently to the pigs being nowadays bought and killed too quickly. This should be understood as an indigenous theory of inflation; nothing confirms that there are fewer pigs now than in the past, as this informant argues. The fate of the traditional currency might change rapidly with the intrusion of paper money (Breton 1999a); however, as noted above, paper money is not a major factor in the present context. Among both Christianized and traditional clans the state currency has not yet been endowed with the symbolic qualities of kipe, although I have witnessed an eagerness to beautify banknotes by perfuming them with trade soap, when it is available. Money is sometimes given in compensations as an alternative to low-value kipe. But the fact that it is not symbolically individualized has prevented it so far from establishing an equivalence with the person. A most interesting point is that, when it is obtained, paper money is often used to buy back shells. the whole for the part Shell money is a "person," a true social being. Shells are individualized objects-particularly the valuable, name-bearing ones. For this reason, it appears that Wodani currency has not been entirely subjected to the process of abstraction that, according to Georg Simmel (1978), led to the power of modern money, which can serve indifferently any number of purposes. But it is precisely to the extent that kipe is personalized that it can provide an adequate equivalence in the compensations associated with matrimony, sorcery, and homicide-that it can serve as an equivalent of life and as a sign of personal values, a function that modern currencies have lost. The Wodani sometimes practice sister exchange, which obviates monetary compensation. Marriage by payment is much more common, but its basic conceptual order is the same.23 In a marriage by payment, a wife is exchanged for a symbolic person formed of shells. When a clan is depleted by the loss of a married-away daughter or a son killed in warfare or by sorcery, shell money must be offered by the group who took the life.24 Just as corporate groups are composed of bodies, a person's body is made of parts. Compensations detotalize persons by enumerating their members and organs. These are specified by symbolically dividing the bride or the victim like a pig that is carved up according to the ritual rule: payment is reckoned on a part-by-part basis, starting with the head and continuing in an order of decreasing importance from the mandible, the heart, the eyes, the kidneys, the backbone, and then on to the rest of the body-the arms, the legs, and even the hair, although the Wodani consider all these too minor for enumeration. Wodani say that shells "sever" the head, "disjoint" the jaw, or "chop up" the body of the bride-the same terms as those used in the carving of a pig. A very valuable shell that pays for the head is said to "kill" the bride.25 Paying for the wife, in men's language, involves symbolically putting her to death and cutting her into pieces. If, in a general sense, kipe is a metaphor for the human body, it is used in a metonymic fashion when it comes to compensate for this very body-thus functioning as a "fractal representation" (Wagner 1991), as the monetary homunculus describes each of the constitutive elements of the person by way of a simple reduction in scale. Shells as symbolic 562 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="6">wholes are added up to pay for a real whole-the compensated person: "fractality deals with wholes no matter how fine the cutting" (Wagner 1991:1 72). The most significant corporeal elements of the bride or victim, paid for with valued kipe, are those attributed to the agency of the father: the head, jaw, heart, eyes, kidneys, and backbone.26 As is true elsewhere in New Guinea, the Wodani have a substantialist theory of procreation according to which the parents provide the fetus with their respective substance: paternal sperm and maternal blood. The mother makes the flesh and the viscera, the father the head, the bones and some organs such as the heart and eyes-which are both the seat of the person's soul, of its active spiritual component endowed with an autonomous psychological faculty. As the source of dream life, it is an eschatological unconscious, which frees itself after death and turns into a ghost and which-so long as the person is alive-can be seen only as a reflection of the self in the pupil of someone else. The eyes are at once the mirror of the other's identity and the seat of the subject's soul. This aspect of the self is an image that presupposes the existence of the other: its visibility expresses its intrinsic social dimension. The eyes are also the first organ of the fetus to take form. In the course of the funeral celebration of a young bachelor who did not have the time to enjoy the advantages that go with the possession of money, shells of little value are sometimes crushed and placed upon his heart when he is laid in his sepulcher, reinforcing the connection between shell money and the soul.27 According to the Wodani, kipe as well as pigs and some male crops such as taro share with humans the privilege of possessing souls of their own. A bride is paid for entirely with shell money (pigs are forbidden), but the price of a victim must be made "heavy" with live pigs, which sometimes make up the totality of the payment. In this case also, the murdered man is said to be paid by parts, head first and then on to the rest of the body. Thus the compensation of a woman is paid with male valuables only, while the blood price for a man must include at least some female ones: as is common in Melanesia, genders cross in the exchange. This also means that live persons are compensated with immortal wealth, while dead persons are paid for with live wealth; what is at stake in both cases is the regeneration of life and the conversion of bodily and monetary substances. Such a system of compensation expresses the value and meaning of persons by "cutting" them up into to their generic and corporeal-that is, their social-components while introduc- ing a hierarchy between these, putting patrilineal aspects on top. In the same way as a shell as a totality represents a part of the person, the person as a totality composed of social parts is conceived as an element of the clan body. Thanks to these fractal encompassments, the upward and downward conversion of social and monetary substances is made symbolically possible. of pigs and noses At this point, I would like to address the gendered aspect of the means of exchange. This implies delineating more precisely what lies outside of the compensating power of shell money. This is best illustrated by looking at the final installment of the matrimonial payment, called the "pig of the nose." It is paid a long time after marriage, usually after the wife's death. A small live pig is given to her brother by her son or by her husband in the name of their son. The pig has to be paid back in cowries by the recipient some time later. It is the only matrimonial compensation not made in cowries and entailing a counter donation. Whether the marriage has been arranged through sister exchange or by a regular payment does not make any difference as to the wife's, husband's, or son's obligation to offer the pig of the nose; however, certain conditions apply: ? If the woman did not bear any children, no pig must be given. ? If she bore only one or two sons but no daughter, the pig of the nose is not customary, unless the payer chooses to offer a male pig. shell money 563</page><page sequence="7">? If the wife has had at least one daughter (and any number of sons), on the sole condition that the daughter has been married, it is mandatory that a sow be given by the wife's husband or by one of her classificatory sons. This is the pig of the nose proper. ? If she has had no daughter but at least three sons, the pig of the nose applies too, and a sow must be offered by her husband or her eldest son. A sow is given when the pig of the nose is mandatory, whereas it is a boar when the gift is optional. For the Wodani, the sow is of greater value relative to the boar due to the fact that the sow gives birth. What has value in their eyes, then, is either bridewealth brought to the clan by the marriage of a daughter or strength added to the corporate group by the birth of three sons. Once again, the equivalence between the monetary and corporeal aspects of the clan body is made clear. However, the fact that a married daughter is worth three sons shows that the shell wealth she brings to her clan is of value above and beyond its mere demographic increase. This wealth will contribute to her clan brother's matrimonial payment and thus to the reproduction of the clan.28 A daughter represents embodied social wealth (see Strathern 1984). The symbol- ism of the means of payment is clear: a boar represents the infecundity of sons, while a sow represents the fecundity of a daughter. It cannot be, however, her reproductive ability proper, since her children belong to her husband's clan; however, through shell wealth given to them, her clan brothers elicit her fecundity. The pig of the nose compensates the last unpaid patrilineal element of the wife (all others having been paid for at the time of marriage). Her nose is a masculine organ associated with her father's agency, as are her head, eyes, and heart; it is the second organ to take shape in the embryo, right after the eyes. While payments at the time of marriage would offset mere corporeal aspects of the bride, the pig of the nose is destined to compensate a function-not so much her reproductive ability but, rather, her capacity to produce monetary wealth indirectly through engendering a daughter.29 This feminine ability is metaphorically designated as a masculine, patrilineal organ because it involves a masculine outcome: shell wealth. In other words, the procreative ability of a woman is understood as the masculine agency of her clan. Her nose represents the phallic potency of her patrilineage. It is implied that if women can bear children, it is because they are engendered by men and belong to patrilineal clans. This masculine aspect of a woman's fertility is valued insofar as it benefits her son in the form of a reproductive capacity embodied in shell wealth. The pig of the nose is given to a woman's brother by her son or by her husband in the name of their son. Although, according to the Wodani, it pertains to the matrimonial compensation complex, there is a shift of perspective. It is not the husband who pays for a woman with male valuables; rather, it is the son who explicitly acknowledges the matrilateral masculine agency from which he benefited and which he now returns in the form of female wealth. Following Nancy Munn's (1986:200, 270) seminal formulation of the counter gift as the iconic representation of what has been accomplished by the gift upon the recipient's self, I suggest that by giving the pig of the nose, the son manifests the contribution to his own self by his mother's clan. It is his mother's clan that enables him to establish his own patrilineal identity through the begetting of children. In effect, the reproductive capacity of a clan in the form of shell money for its sons is indirectly provided by their mothers' clan in the form of daughters. The fecundity of a woman is not only masculine but also phallic.30 In the kinship terminology, the mother's brother, who receives payment for the nose of his sister, is indifferently called "mother" or "father." The pig of the nose accounts for a mother's mediated agency in a son's patrilineal identity,31 but it describes it as a masculine power that has to be compensated for with female wealth.32 That the mother's brother should give back shell money against the pig of the nose expresses a crucial point: the gift by a married sister to her son by the mother, the gift of bridewealth for this sister to her brother by her husband, the gift of male wealth to his nephew by the maternal uncle-all are symbolically equivalent acts, at the very root of clan reproduction. 564 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="8">This development about the masculine symbolization of female abilities brings me back to the fact that there is no formal enumeration for the maternal parts of the bride or victim; nor is there any mention of their sexual organs, although Wodani say they pay for the whole body. In other words, the monetary description of the person, whether a bride or a male victim, is incomplete. Their symbolic bodies are lacunary: in the context of compensation they are bodies without sex, in which only the patrilineal organs are explicitly enumerated. And this is exactly what we observe in the symbolic anatomy of the shell, which is described as a human body reduced to its head, centered around an enlarged mouth at the bottom of which one can distinguish the backbone. Monetary compensations define the person as a generic being, a member of his or her clan, not as a sexually differentiated individual. In a sense, there is only one symbolic gender, and it is male. In "cutting up" the body of the bride or the victim, shell money payments do not reduce the individual totality to fragments but, rather, produce social components that can be recycled in monetary form into the clan body. There is a double movement: first a detotalization that "splits up" the person into its patrilineal elements, then a totalization that constitutes the clan as a whole made out of corporeal elements, as a pool of patrilineal organs.33 from the person to the commonwealth The whole body of the bride (or the victim), including matrilineal elements, is said to be paid for, although only the most important patrilineal organs are enumerated. The payment is shared among the woman's (or the victim's) patrilineal clan brothers and also, as I will show, among the men who helped her father pay for her mother. Entitlement to the payment is determined through cooperation with or affiliation to the clan of the father of the bride. However, beneficiaries also implicitly receive payment for the bride's maternal organs, for, in agreeing to receive payment for her mother- both at the time of marriage and subsequently-in the form of the pig of the nose, her maternal clan waives any further claim to its own clan substance embodied in the mother's child. By virtue of marriage, a woman has been in some sense incorporated into her husband's clan.34 Patrilineal clans are entitled to receive compensation both for their own alienated substance and for their wives' as embodied in their children. (For additional information about murder compensations, see Breton 1999a.) No one is obliged to contribute to a marriage payment. Such payments are carried out within a clan-based or residence-based community, but a clan brother is easily able to free himself from this formal obligation if he wishes. All matrimonial payments take the form of an interest-free loan to be reimbursed identically in kind and amount upon the marriage of a daughter issuing from the union. Any man who fails to contribute is subsequently unable to transmit the corresponding matrimonial credit to his son. A man whose mother was paid for by his father with help from a third party is not obliged to reimburse this debt with his own shells; rather, part of his sister's bridewealth should be paid by the groom's contributors directly to the bride's (and his) father's creditor. The matrimonial debt is thus not owed on men but on women. A man who is reimbursed for a matrimonial credit previously established by his father is said to take his "father's finger." It is also common that a man may finally collect at the time of a woman's marriage a payment that he was entitled to on the marriage of her mother but could not receive then for any reason (his early age, lack offunds on the part ofthe groom). Matrimonial credits are thus owed to those who lent money to or were owed money by a groom. Men readily take on other men's matrimonial payment obligations in order to establish credit to be repaid a generation later. Creditors are at the heart of the process of social reproduction. Nothing can be done without them. Credit is a form of long-term savings organized by the principle of clan solidarity. Such solidarity is actually nothing but an accumulation of debts. It is for this reason that, as a normal beneficiary of his sister's bridewealth, the brother yields part shell money 565</page><page sequence="9">of his rights in favor of their father's marriage creditors. In this way, the eldest brother may be the "owner of the bride" without necessarily being the "owner of the head," that is, the recipient of major payments. Claims on the bride's symbolic body are divided between so many candidates as are able to assert their rights. All matrimonial credits are tallied up, even among clan brothers of the husband. In no case must the father receive any part of the payment of his daughter's marriage. Wodani say he must not "eat" her bridewealth; a man will refuse even to comment on the transaction (in contrast, fathers are among the main contributors to their sons' matrimonial payments and may also discuss these payments freely). This prohibition goes to the extent of preventing a man from enjoying even the indirect fruits of his daughter's marriage payment. If, for instance, a pig has been purchased with a shell received by one of her marriage payment recipients, her father will be barred from eating its meat, even if the pig has been subsequently bought by someone else with another shell and then offered to him. The pig is irremediably marked by the original payment, which has a contagious effect. Thus, as I will make clear, shell transfers induce changes of substance and identity. At any one time, the value of a bride is determined not so much by contemporary circumstances as by liabilities established by the previous generation. Shell money economy condenses temporality itself into the circulation of shells, in the context of which the distinction between owing and being owed shells is more important than the distinction between living and dead persons-protecting the clan's substance and continuity from disruption by birth and death alike. Such a system of credit has important consequences concerning a person's identity. It enables any man to take part in matrimonial payments, even if he is from a different clan. If a (male) foreigner settles on another clan's territory and repeatedly contributes to his hosts' payments, he will eventually gain membership in their clan. For the Wodani, this is the only (and very common) means of changing clan affiliation. Men would do so in order to reside with their affines or friends. The contrast between the symbolic finiteness of the clan body and the fluidity of clan membership is thus only apparent: shell money contributions can in some sense increase the clan substance by allowing reaffiliation. The clan is essentially a community of shareholders bound up together in matrimonial investment projects. Sharing money is equivalent to sharing social (i.e., bodily) identity. Contributing to the purchase of shares of his new brothers' wives enables an immigrant to receive a portion in return for the payment of their sisters-a payment he "eats" and which transforms his identity. His social reaffiliation-described as a body transformation-is the consequence both of his monetary contributions and of his subsequent right to "eat" his new sisters' marriage payments. Eating shell money obtained from a clan transaction or eating food grown on the clan territory has the same result, defined in terms of bodily identity. The rule of presumption of paternity confirms the equivalence between bodily substance and shell money. It is said by the Wodani that the child's genitor is the legitimate husband of the mother, that is, he who entirely "bought" her. If a young woman becomes pregnant by a man who fails to make good on the payment of the union, and she leaves him to marry another man who fulfills his matrimonial payment obligations, the new husband acquires the status of father of the child, for the child does not grow of itself in its mother's womb but is, in effect, grown by repeated impregnations, so that two men can contribute their male substance to the fetus. What ultimately differentiates their agency is whether they have paid for the mother or not. A child is said to have obtained only the eyes-the first organ to develop in the fetus, the symbol of patrilineal identity-from the mother's original and failed husband, while the rest of its body has been produced by the legitimate husband. Such a child is said to be the "child of the owner." Having paid for the mother has the same meaning as having engendered the child. The transfer of shell money for the mother results in an equivalent transfer of substance to the child. The right to affiliation defined by the original impregnation, which normally produces the primordial 566 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="10">patrilineal organs, is canceled by the subsequent payment. This mechanism is even more striking in the case of a newborn whose mother has died in childbirth and who is taken in and nursed by a foster mother. The husband of the foster mother is said to be the child's legitimate father, and the child is left only with the eyes from its genitor; this in no way gives the genitor the right to affiliate the child to his clan, for the Wodani consider that a man whose wife nurses the child has contributed substance to the child. To have paid for the mother expresses agency with respect to the bodily identity and produces a right for the clan membership of her child. The claim of the genitor is subordinated to the right of the father. In a similar vein, accepting food from someone to whose matrimonial payment one has contributed is unthinkable-at least until such time as that person has himself become a father. Otherwise, accepting food would invert the order of filiation; profiting from a payment makes one a son, and it is not a son's role to feed his father. An individual whose reaffiliation to a host clan is uncontested can nevertheless be said to have eyes that still belong to his clan of origin-but this is an insult. The expression "to still have one's eyes" is a euphemism for "to be dying." The eyes are the part of the body that is redeemed and dies last. Among the Wodani, it is very rare to find individuals with no reaffiliation in their genealogies; however, the accumu- lation of payments gradually expunges the memory. A man is in some sense the mixture of the substance he has either inherited, bought for others, or for which he has received payment.35 Individual identity is thus a subtractive function of the person's symbolic elements and an additive function of shell payments. Although they are not formally given at once but, rather, one by one, by and to dispersed partners, the shells collected for a compensation constitute an iconic representation of the bride or the victim, in the same way that payments symbolically represent the deceased in the funerary rites of insular Melanesia.36 The compensation forms a symbolic homunculus composed of discrete organs and whose monetary elements were previously used up to pay and represent other persons, so that the body compensated for is symbolically reconfigured from elements of numerous individuals' bodies, most of them dead. In symbolic terms, then, both men and women are the financial products of the moneys raised by their clan. Made up of the sum of payments given and received in the name of all those in their group who procreated before them and of whom they are the product-like a portrait in the manner of Arcimboldo, made up of an accumulation of objects-persons very exactly embody the balance of these transfers. The metonymic function of shell money can be seen from the limited perspective of a transaction assigning a value to each symbolic part of the wife or the victim, as well as from the more global point of view of social groups involved.37 Viewed as a corporate body outliving its members, the clan is the precipitate of monetary transactions. Children bear the trace of all the marriages that preceded that of their parents. This trace materializes in the form of money. Wodani express this enduring materiality in their axiomatic reference to shell money as "the only person who never dies."38 Human generation results from the intersection of two alternate flows, one made up of sexual unions, the other of monetary concentrations. The first flow is destined to entropy, the pulsation of the second is without end (Wagner 1978:65, 1986:58-59). Shell money is indeed the substance of the body politic, just as it is the icon of the person. The fact that it is offered as compensation for both married sisters and murdered brothers points to its importance as symbolic expression of the principle of the clan's corporeal integrity.39 In this respect, it may be considered a res publica, a commonwealth, so long as the notion of wealth is understood in terms of its function as an instrument of social reproduction. The clan's social existence is based on institutional monetary payments; it is the locus of shell money as, in the capitalist economy, the market is the locus of commodities. Thus, for the Wodani, society is composed of two kinds of beings: humans on the one hand, who live, procreate, and die; kipe on the other, symbolic and perpetual persons who are the instruments of human reproduction. Humans are unique, irreplaceable beings; the living cannot bear names shell money 567</page><page sequence="11">that have already been used up by the dead. But by receiving compensation for its murdered sons or married daughters, the clan body claims to recycle their substance into the action and procreation of the living. Thus it can renew and represent itself as an encompassing totality. Payment by parts of the body is common in New Guinea.40 It is practiced by the Melpa of the Papua New Guinea highlands, who pay for the bride's "head" with a pearl shell and her "vagina" with a pig (Strathern 1972:100-11 3; Strathern 1980:57).41 This metonymic construc- tion has a particular significance in the Wodani worldview. The myth of Buba, the primordial ancestor, recounts that Buba asked his younger brother to kill him and cut his body into pieces to be planted in the ground. After a few days, the buried pieces had grown into crops. Thus humankind was able to feed itself from its own flesh, as it were. Each body part yielded a different plant whose gender is defined accordingly. Taro, for instance, grew out of the heart and is thus a male crop, as is sugar cane, which came from the bones; sweet potato on the other hand is the skin of Buba and a female plant.42 From this perspective, monetary detotalization of the body-although it brings about a metaphorical death (that of the bride) or follows a real one (that of the victim)-should be understood as a way of ensuring the clan body reproduction through the collective redistribution and assimilation among clan members of a person's substance, embodied in shell money. the life and works of shell money In addition to its role in matrimonial and homicide compensations, shell money is used to pay for any number of goods and services. It is also the object of a system of exchange that bears some resemblance to the stamp market, in which individuals seek after particular kipe through barter and trade or, to use the operative verb, "pull" them out with incredible voraciousness. Kipe is not only a form of social wealth transfered in the context of institutional compensations; it is also secular wealth, exchanged for its own sake by individuals who act alone. The Wodani share the astounding acquisitive bent of the Kapauku/Ekagi, whom Pospisil (1963a, 1963b) so vividly describes. Kipe is so precious to the Wodani and is invested with so many aesthetic and symbolic qualities that it becomes an object of art collection in its own right. Not only is it the universal standard, it is also the most coveted and most frequently exchanged commodity. It "travels" with disconcerting speed. It is not rare that, having received a shell in payment for a bride, its new owner will turn around and exchange it, such that the shell, after a complicated circuit passing through several intermediaries, ends up in the hands of a wife taker who gives it, the very same day, in the same matrimonial transaction to yet another wife giver. An atmosphere of contraband, lending itself to the sort of expert deceit that is found on the art or antiques market, encourages shell collectors to lie about the name, class, and real value of their cowries to take advantage of the gullible. The exchange of shells is a game, just like the kula-also made up of duplicity and seduction (Damon 1980a:278; Fortune 1932:215-218)- the one difference being that the exchange of shells among the Wodani is not speculative; the payment one receives in exchange for one's kipe is agreed upon in advance, the only difficulty being to judge correctly the value of the shell. It is not unusual that some particularly coveted kipe might be provisionally retained when its holder experiences a sort of connoisseur's fondness for it, thereby attracting the attentions of numerous claimants anxious to obtain it for themselves. The person who refused to part with his possession in good time would be treated with the same disdain and reproach as someone who ate alone in front of others-an unpardonable impropriety. A great emphasis is put on the necessity of circulating shells, thus multiplying the social debt and the common wealth. The kipe is not an object that can be innocently hoarded. It is said that the shell's soul, if the cowry is kept too long in one's money bag, will eventually devour 568 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="12">the soul of its owner or call the anger of Tege upon him. There is also something fundamentally disappointing about the kipe which always leads its holder-like the stamp collector-to exchange it for another one. There exists moreover an implicit rule obliging its owner to relinquish it in exchange for any reasonable offer. As soon as a man shows or lets it be known that he is in possession of a certain piece of money, he opens himself up to having to negotiate it. This is because the person who catches sight of an object obtains a sort of right to it. To walk through a garden is to demand some of its fruit. A man who sees another man eating a sweet potato takes it from his hands without further justification.43 It often happens that the witnesses to a matrimonial payment receive a share, albeit a tiny one, just for good form. The verb to see means "to find again" but also expresses the idea of placing something in one's dependency or action; when it is said that a fruit is "seen" by the sun, it is meant that it is spoiled by it. Compounds of the verb to see refer to an incipient action. Literally speaking, to touch means "to see with the hand." The habitual aspect of this verb is used after an adjective with the meaning of to be. The man who is unable to obtain shells will say he does not see them. He will exorcise Bayato, an avatar of the spirit Yamba responsible for his blindness. Conversely, to exhibit oneself in a ridiculous attire, for instance, with a child's bow and a woman's skirt over a grotesque uncut penis sheath, is a way of justifying a claim for compensation. The claimant will take pains to repeatedly ask, "Is this pretty?" An important shell, which travels in plain sight of everyone and whose history is known to all, is said to be "visible"-just like the name of the shell owner in the kula (Damon 1980a:280). If its destiny has recently been determined-for instance, by agreement that it is to be used as "head payment"-the person who holds it will refuse to show it just to satisfy people's idle curiosity; he will go to the extent of saying he has already given it away to avoid having to show it at such an untimely moment. To see is a bit more than just to see: it is already to appropriate for oneself. The whole art is thus to exhibit or to conceal a kipe at the right moment, because the act of showing or making public constitutes a first degree of alienation. It is said of a shell that is the object of a transaction-whether given or received-that it is eaten and that it dies on this occasion. If it has been purchased on credit (literally, "eaten for nothing") and its last installment-payable in pigs and cowries-is still owing, it remains alive and must in no case be disposed of, exchanged with a third party, or otherwise alienated.44 Conversely, it is said to be dead the moment the final payment has been received,45 in the same way as the bride is said to be killed by the payment. But this death is only relative to the transaction in question and for the former owner of the kipe, because it never ceases being exchanged and, one might say, dying again for the next one who loses it. Eating a cowry also refers to the notion that an end is put to its possession in sacrificial fashion by killing the pig whose purchase it has made possible and whose soul will be eaten by the spirits. To eat a very valuable shell-with the disdain required by the occasion-is to be greater than those who envy one or the circumstances in which one acquired it. The same vocabulary is used to describe murder compensations (literally, "to cook a man"). Those who pay for the homicide are said to cook the victim in the earth oven, like a pig, and those who receive payment are said metaphorically to eat him (Breton 1999a). The recipients of a marriage compensation also eat the bride. Whether it be in the context of marriage or murder, obtaining a kipe always amounts to eating it. Money's destiny is in the belly--and above all, in the belly of a pregnant wife for whom it constituted payment. But this could be taken still further. To the extent that shell money provides a corporeal representation of the clan, I would argue that future marriages are made up of the fragments of past marriages, previous wives being eaten through the exchange that now symbolically dismembers the current bride. Monetary payments engender one another through successive ingestions. Human reproduction is built upon the consumption of wives' and victims' monetary representations (see de Coppet 1970:33). shell money 569</page><page sequence="13">The clan is a social body whose depletion (in the form of married-away daughters and murdered sons) must be compensated by the allied or adverse clan who took the life. Such payment leads to a symbolic regurgitation; to eat is to replenish oneself. It is a way of recycling the social components of lost members into the life of those who stay within the clan. In the same way as the metaphorical eating of the dead among the Merina of Madagascar is, as Maurice Bloch puts it, "the very epitome of the representation of descent"(1 985:637), the fact that compensation recipients are said by the Wodani to eat wealth leads-insofar as shell money is the equivalent of patrilineal substance-to the symbolic recycling and reconstitution of clan identity: Descent is the merging of the living, the dead, and the ancestral in order to produce an enduring, ideally eternal, entity. However, given the nasty habit people have of being born and dying, this still eternity requires continual movement in order to ensure the transmission of substance .... Eating is the destruction of the specific individual form of the object eaten, but the retention of its substance. Eating therefore implies the reduction of individuals to a mere descent substance endlessly reused and taking specific forms which then again need to be destroyed in their specificity in order to be reused. [Bloch 1985:640, 634] It is now possible to specify, in the Wodani context, the meaning of to see and to eat and the corresponding symbolic importance of the shell's eyes and mouth. These are organs that open the self to the world and by which the person becomes a social, relational, consuming, and replenishable being. The eyes are the first organ to take form in the embryo, they are the locus of the self and of its social, patrilineal identity. As organs of vision, they induce the self to enter into a relation with the exterior world. As for the mouth, it is an organ of incorporation. It allows for the transformation of things into persons, of dead flesh into living body. From this perspective, I would argue that shell money is an instrument of social reproduction that allows for the conversion of the nonself into the self, the social substance of brides and victims into active members of the clan.46 Whereas for the Merina of Madagascar the problem is to reuse their dead, for the Wodani clan it is to recycle its lost members. For the former, social reproduction takes a diachronic dimension, for the latter it is synchronic; kipe represents social substance but only transitorily, at the moment of payment-it is not hoarded as a treasure of clan identity that should be left unsquandered. Kipe is both social wealth, alienable and circulating, and individual property, acquired through personal initiative. It conjoins in an original fashion individual agency and clan reproduction. the law of division In the above-mentioned context of shell collecting, the more valued kipe, those used for "head payment," are exchanged on a five-item basis (the total unit being one hand), that is, one valuable shell against four cowries of a lower denomination plus a whole pig or a side of pork to pay for the shell's head.47 Purchased shells are cut up by the exchange, as was the bride. But as I will show, the only organ that brides and shells have in common in this process of division is the head. The valuable kipe that is divided into several pieces is the mother; the cowries used to pay for it are her children.48 Shell money classes are said to be either male or female. Specific denominations form couples with shells belonging to other classes. The mother, however, can be male or female; the gender metaphor is not rigorously upheld when the exchange takes place. Contrary to the kula (Malinowski 1922:356), cowries are not considered to couple up as they are traded. As already noted, the body of the kipe does not show any genital organ; its gender is determined by its form-long ones being male and wider ones female. Like the bride, the cowry is divided in the exchange, but the model for the cutting up of the bride is the pig, while the division of a shell takes the metaphor of the carving up of a marsupial. 570 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="14">The marsupial is divided into four quarters after being cooked. A pig, on the other hand, can be carved into any number of pieces before being cooked.49 It is specifically the dismemberment of the pig that requires the disjoining of the head and the jaw that is so important to the metaphors of matrimonial payment. A carved marsupial is distributed among four people; it is said to have had children, as if the carving gave something extra-four pieces from one. It is division itself that produces the symbolic increase. The numeral classifier (itibu) that designates the four quarters of the marsupial is also used for kipe. Thus shells symbolically appear to be the result of a division, as if they were given birth by the act of exchange. In the same way, exchange multiplies shells by killing them; the four lower-value shells given against one valuable kipe are quarters, in other words, children. It is in this way that the fiction of shell money's reproductive capacity and the constant increase of wealth through exchange is sustained.50 Importantly, monetary transactions share the same semantic field as killing, the cutting up of bodies, eating, and the symbolic multiplication of elements through exchange and division. The Wodani often use the idiom of sexual reproduction in reference to monetary transactions-the kipe may have children-but by this they are not referring to feminine activities linked to real increase, such as giving birth or giving food. For the Wodani, if the kipe has children, this is in keeping with the masculine law of division. As I have shown, it is not a shell but, rather, a sow-the pig of the nose-that is given when the indirect production of money through feminine fecundity is to be compensated. In contrast, the carving and distribution of marsupial meat yields the metaphor used to describe the masculine production of money through exchange. The specific character of this masculine multiplication finds expression in the opposition between two modes of symbolic production: between a pig that women have fattened up and which will also give birth and a marsupial killed by men and then shared. It is here that the power to kill rejoins the fantasy of masculine parthenogenesis, of endogenous and asexuated production. There are further relevant differences between pigs and marsupials. One can feed pigs, but one must catch marsupials. One who does not see game cannot see shell money either. The cure is the same for both predicaments. Pigs multiply thanks to women's domestic labor in supplying them with food. Kipe multiply thanks to men's social labor of traveling in quest for shells. A shell's head is a pig, but its four parts are counted up as if they were a marsupial's quarters. Shell money, then, in a way that is pecular for a masculine wealth item, stands in between men and women. It is a crossover. While women deal with children and pigs, and pigs deal with men who have been killed, living men deal with shell money, and shell money deals with brides. The convention on which sociality is based is the duality of the sexes and the separation of their respective agency; but social life requires their constant conversion. Pigs and shells are the instruments of such conversion. To pursue the analysis of the indigenous notion of division, I want to add that the third and last numeral classifier applicable to cowries (kade) designates the wooden boards used for building garden fences or house walls-objects creating a separation, fundamental to Wodani thought, between inside and outside, domestic space and forest, the intimate and the unknown. It also refers to the masculine tools used for purposes of destruction or breaking things into pieces: bows,51 axes, and bush knives. To recapitulate, the Wodani use three context-inde- pendent numeral classifiers for kipe. These particles are regular nouns and have lexical meanings that perfectly describe their symbolic dimension when they are used as classifiers: * The first (eba) also means skin: shell money is a body, a person. * The second (itibu) also designates a quarter of marsupial: shell money is the result of a division. * The third (kade) also designates a board, bow, or sharp tool:52 shell money is an instrument for separating, demarcating, and putting to death. The last two aspects are most striking. In one, shell money is conceived as the result of what it brings about in the other; it is at once what separates and what is separated, what kills and what is being killed. But the terms eba and kade yield another expression of the same contrast. shell money 571</page><page sequence="15">In fact, eba designates not only the skin but also the bark of a tree and, by extension, the roof of a house. As soon as a shelter is covered, it becomes a corporeal, uterine totality. Some parts of the house bear names referring to the human body. Significantly, a newly built house and a new birth are consecrated with an identically named ritual meal-consisting of marsupial meat, not pork. For a new house, meat is eaten by the family and, rather than being burned as they would be normally, the bones are saved to decorate the house. In the case of a birth, only the mother and the women who assisted her (but not the men) consume the ritual food. The ritual meals establish an equivalence: house is to family as mother is to child. In contrast to these integrating and encompassing associations denoted by the term eba, the word kade implies a differentiation with the outside. This implication is evident in the semantic articulation of eato, "near the house, inside the fences," meaning "garden," and tapaato, "outside the fences," meaning "foreign." The contrast between what divides and what is divided-expressed by the pair kade/itibu-is thus echoed in the distinction between envelope and content on the one hand and between separation and threshold on the other-expressed by the couple eba/kade. This is another expression of the totalizing and detotalizing function of shell money, which breaks persons into pieces, selects specific elements, and reconstructs a social whole out of these. Kipe is an instrument of both division and encompassment. Melanesian perspectives I would like atthis point to introduce a comparison with another Melanesian monetary system that deals in a different way with the very elements that we have just considered, that of the 'Are'are of the island of Malaita, in the Solomon archipelago, described by Daniel de Coppet. Their currency, made up of strings of pearls, appears to be an abstract instrument of measure rather than the metaphor of a concrete body. Its role is nonetheless to form a symbolic equivalence with the person-but by emphasizing cosmic rather than corporeal aspects. According to the 'Are'are, humans are made up of three components: body, breath, and image (de Coppet 1981:178; these glosses are not indigenous, they are the ethnographer's; for an alternative description of the three components-more adequate but less useful in the context of the present article-see de Coppet 1998:165). Breath is the life principle that animates the body, to which the image-made up of social relations-is added (de Coppet 1995:252). These aspects make up the totality of the cosmos and repeatedly crystallize in human existence, which alone is able to bring them all together; but they preexist and survive this contingent event. The person is thus a provisional combination of individuated sociocosmic aspects. Human existence is neither destroyed nor produced by death and generation, which merely link or dissociate the elements. As with Empedocles, there is neither end nor beginning. Mixing is all: birth is a word that has currency only among humans. It is important that the aspects be correctly recycled through ritual in order for society to ensure its own permanence (de Coppet 1981:1 76). The mortals' destiny is controlled through the exhibition, consumption, and distribution of products symbolically embodying each of the three aspects in such a way as to ensure that they are passed along. Taro is used to represent the body, pork to represent the breath, and money to represent the image. One slight difference with regard to the Wodani can be pointed out. In both instances, money is used to produce a representation of the person based upon a principle of decomposition. But while it is corporeal in the case of the Wodani, it is sociocosmic in the case of the 'Are'are. One instance combines parts of a singular body; the other is a combination of elements whose nature is fundamentally collective, only accidentally individual, and not strictly corporeal. For both, however, monetary payments amount to recycling aspects of the person, that is, social substances. 572 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="16">This is what matrimonial transactions in Malaita show (de Coppet 1995:249-251). A first celebration takes place at the house of the bride's parents, to whom the groom's kin offer two sums of money: one will be returned to them during the second matrimonial celebration in the form of shell money as well as taros to be planted and pigs to be raised by the couple; the other is the price of the body, breath, and image of the bride. The second celebration takes place at the groom's parents' house. There, having received the counter payment mentioned above, the groom's parents offer two new monetary gifts to the bride givers to offset the taros and pigs that the latter contributed to the meal and whose consumption brought about a further transfer of body and breath in favor of the married couple and their future children. 'Are'are wife givers donate a bride, as well as products to be consumed, planted, or raised by the wife takers; the wife takers invariably respond with money. The wife takers' first payment triggers the conversion of shell money into body, breath, and image-aspects that will be passed on to the couple's children. Money is offered to the wife's side, and the three aspects are then transferred to the husband's side, ready to be embodied in a new generation. Matrimonial payments allow components of the person to be transmitted in such a way as to flow from one generation into the next: they have a procreative capacity. If 'Are'are marriage establishes a relationship between the living and their descendants, funerals are destined to give new and omnipotent ancestors to the living. While matrimonial payments coagulate the three sociocosmic aspects in children, mortuary payments dissolve and convert them into money. Marriages and funerals form a single institution, at the two extremities of the transformation chain (de Coppet 1995:242, 248, 255). In marriage, the point is to bring descendants into being; in funerals, it is to give birth to ancestors. Like marriages, funerals can be broken down into two celebrations (de Coppet 1981:182-189, 1995:251-255). Two parties share the responsibilities: on the one hand, the deceased's kin, and on the other, the deceased's friends and affines, who serve as grave diggers. The initial celebration is the occasion for several payments. The first is the distribution of two piles of taros, coconuts, and pork that the two groups have exchanged, the deceased's kin having crowned theirs with shell money, thus displaying a generic image of the dead, a homunculus complete with the three aspects. This representation has to be eaten by men. Next, the participants from both parties give small sums of money that are gathered together and exhibited by the family of the deceased. The sum is then proclaimed, this time establishing the image-that is, the social value of the deceased. At the end of the ceremony, it is transferred to the grave diggers who then give it to their clients on the condition that it be returned to them in its entirety during the second celebration several years later. The second celebration is given by the grave diggers to whom the moneys that constituted the image of the deceased are returned. Mean- while, they have been exchanged any number of times in various transactions. The image of the deceased has thus spread out over a range of exchanges, permeating the social fabric. The grave diggers give back the sum total to the parents of the deceased, who once again proclaim the amount before returning exactly their contribution to the initial donors. The representation of the departed-transformed into an ancestor through the proclama- tion-is made up of image fragments of the long since dead, since all the components of the monetary system were at one time or another the object of comparable funeral transactions. The ritual production of ancestors follows a dynamics similar to that of the generation of descendants. In the same way that the children of the living are the result of the conversion of money into the three aspects, the transformation of the dead into ancestors is made possible by the distribution and circulation of these same aspects precipitated as money. Shell money is what remains of the dead after mourning is over; it is the substance of the ancestors (de Coppet 1970b:36-37).53 Death breaks up the aspects, the funeral brings them back together; marriage disperses them, procreation gathers them together again. Men's action turns death into money, shell money 573</page><page sequence="17">while women's action turns money into children. There is no conceptual opposition between social operations and the physiological process. Money functions on both registers. For the Wodani, as for the 'Are'are, money allows a representation-literally, a re-presenta- tion-of the person to be formed on the basis of his or her symbolic components. This representation is far from the canonical Western conception of the atomistic individual, that indivisible being held to be at the root of social relations rather than being produced by them (see Strathern 1988). There is a common point between the two systems: money detotalizes the person and breaks it up into its social components in order to recycle them in new beings. But what distinguishes them is that the Wodani do not stress a transfer of aspects between generations to the same extent as the 'Are'are do-this emphasis being precisely what allows the latter to give birth to their own ancestors. For the 'Are'are, the monetary flow has distinctly diachronic effects. Let us take a closer look at this contrast, but first of all let us examine what may bring the two systems together. It is true that among the Wodani, one does encounter some clues as to the cyclical character of death and generation; two examples in particular come to mind. First, the succession of generations is represented as a piling up, in which the ancestors occupy the lower strata. The word pago refers to both the ancestors and the humus that has accumulated on the forest floor. The first feces of newborn infants as well as the feces of people in their death throes are said to look alike and are called pago nota baa (excrement of eaten humus). Although the distinction between the two meanings of pago is clear, I would argue that the newborn and the dying are shown in this way to share something with their ancestors, by origin or destination, thanks to a metaphorical act of eating. Second, it is in the leaves of the same tree that the newborn infant is enveloped, the placenta is buried, and the corpse of an adult is inhumed without ornaments, as naked as at the moment of birth. This tree is the first growth in abandoned gardens, and is thus well suited to marking a renewal following a death. It is also used to make the flexible floor of the dance house. The dance house is placed under the protection of Yamba spirits favorable to money and sexual endeavors. The cycle between life and death is thus complete. In my view, Wodani shell money functions synchronically rather than on the diachronic dimension stressed by the 'Are'are. I see three forms of evidence for this. First, the Wodani do not share the 'Are'are notion-specific to them-that money dies. When a genealogical line breaks off in Malaita from a lack of descendants, the old man who is its last representative buries all the shell wealth he owns in the grave of one of his ancestors (de Coppet 1970b:37). With the extinction of his line, the cult of the dead comes to an end, as does, consequently, the value and procreative power of shell money. On the other hand, among the Wodani, it is said that "money never dies." No guarantee as to its value is provided by the action of the ancestors. As long as life goes on, shell money cannot escape exchange. Further, nothing connects it to a particular lineage or clan. Shells of little value sometimes accompany the dead, but never named kipe-that is forbidden, unthinkable. When a man dies, the young men of his clan have the right to demand a part of his shell wealth as an inheritance, even if they belong to a very distant lineage. This sometimes leads to recriminations or disputes during funerals. There is thus an obligation, although it encounters resistance, to recycle part of a man's wealth outside the circle of his legitimate heirs. If an old man sees death approaching and has no descendants, he will spend his money on pork to avoid the displeasure of having to think of those who would have liked to profit from his death. Money belongs only to the living. Second, the Wodani do not share the 'Are'are view as to the relative superiority of the partners in a monetary transaction. For the 'Are'are, wife givers are inferior to wife takers (de Coppet 1970b:23, 1995:245, 251, 271). How indeed could it be otherwise, considering that it is the latter whose task it is-through the giving of shell money-to revive the cosmic cycle whose significance surpasses the actors involved? Moreover, the superiority at issue is extended to all 574 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="18">donors of money and for the same reason (de Coppet 1998:207). For the Wodani, on the other hand, it is the takers of money who enjoy a superior status. I purposefully say the takers of money and not the wife givers because of the net gain in terms of shells upon which this superiority is based, as expressed by the dominant and aggressive position of the person who is paid. This is to say that the transaction's meaning appears to be exhausted in the act itself. Contrary to the 'Are'are, the Wodani do not say that a gift of shells triggers a reciprocal transfer of fecundity from the recipient. For them, shell money is fecundity in itself. Third, Wodani and 'Are'are do not hold the same opinion regarding sister exchange. Sister exchange is common among the Wodani, for whom it provides the model for marriage by payment. Conversely, for the 'Are'are, sister exchange is a prohibited if not unthinkable form of marriage (de Coppet 1970b:27). Since sister exchange obviates payment, it would prevent the conversion of shell money against the three aspects, leading to the sterility of the matrimonial union. In other words, for the 'Are'are shell money transactions are indispensable for conception to occur. For the Wodani, on the other hand, conception requires no monetary transfer-even if the payments may have direct effects on clan affiliation, as is shown by the theory of paternity. I do not want to exaggerate the contrast between the 'Are'are and the Wodani; however, I regard their differences as significant. For the 'Are'are, the pulsating regularity of the cycles of payments provide a sociocosmic framework for time, enabling the society to produce its own germinal ancestors. There is nothing comparable for the Wodani. For them, the deceased is spontaneously transformed into a ghost without any ritual operation; the deceased maintains its individual and autonomous character right into oblivion. To the Wodani, humans are born and pass away, but money never dies. In other words, for the 'Are'are, monetary exchanges produce time, while for the Wodani, time is flattened out by the exchanges, subsumed within the circulation of kipe. The former do not seem to use shell money in utilitarian, individual transactions (de Coppet 1968:47) to the extent and with the same voracity as the Wodani. The 'Are'are maintain their exchanges within a diachronic ritual framework, whereas the Wodani establish a constant, synchronic link between secular short-term transactions and social reproduction. money and time I conclude by drawing inspiration from Roy Wagner's (1991) reflections on the fractal character of the person in Melanesia. There, he finds that the distinction of the part from the whole is inapplicable. Society's constitutive elements-persons and groups-do not conform to a relation between units and aggregates but, rather, represent changeable perspectives preserving the same order of symbolic relations at each level. Wagner points out that there are two ways of looking at the identity of a person: either as the fruit of a succession of engenderings or as an element in this chain, as a genitor. If, in the first case, the person is the product of the group, in the second, it is the group that is the product of the person. These are not heterogeneous dimensions, but partial and homothetic points of view; one might think of them as the same reality observed on two different scales. The Wodani monetary system involves repeated conversions in which the parts of a person's body receive money's symbolic body as an equivalence. Shell money is an instrument enabling the endless composition and decomposition of the clan and the person which, as Marilyn Strathern (1 988:1 2-1 5) has emphasized, appear in the course of this movement as at once plural and singular entities. Just as Wodani shell money provides a representation of the person, it provides a representation of society. It translates the diachronic dimension of the social body-the product of a series of successive engenderings-on a synchronic level, like a continuity of persons who distribute shares in wives in the same way they would distribute shares in capital. It is in this way that the detotalizing and totalizing functions of shell money shell money 575</page><page sequence="19">should be understood, decomposing persons to form a social whole or recycling elements of this whole to produce a person, a singular totality. The only person who never dies, shell money represents the principle of continuity for the social body, which can follow upon itself despite the death of its members, just like Lichtenberg's knife, which remains the same in spite of the fact that first its blade and then its handle have been changed-a recurrent metaphor in New Guinea, for instance in the perpetuity of cult objects or ritual houses. The Manambu (Harrison 1990:62) or the Telefolmin (Jorgensen 1990:151-152) describe the continuity of cult houses in this fashion-as symbols of the transcendant nature of male communities which are not altered despite their being repaired.54 Shell money is a symbol of incorporation and social continuity. The 'Are'are express this idea laconically by saying that money is the substance of their ancestors (de Coppet 1970b:31, 37, 39). The Wodani would be unlikely given their circumstances to apply this elegant formulation to their own conception. In their view, shell money expresses the principle of social continuity not so much as diachronic succession than as synchronic extension. They treat the question as a problem linked to space and quantity, rather than to time. For them the metonymic function prevails. Wodani money symbolically fragments the person to be negotiated between contem- poraries, while the 'Are'are recompose the person on a dimension encompassing the dead and the unborn (de Coppet 1981:202 n. 17). In other words, for the 'Are'are, shell money metamorphoses the extension of exchanges into time, whereas for the Wodani, it condenses time into the extension of credits. For both, it allows society to build a bridge between life and death. There are three spheres of monetary exchange among the Wodani, by increasing order of social integration. The first deals with consumption-goods against shells; the second has to do with speculation-shells against shells; the last is concerned with reproduction-life against shells. These spheres are entirely convertible, upwardly as well as downwardly. One can start out with a pig, exchange it for shells, and end up with a wife; conversely, the bride is said to be "eaten" after the downward conversion of her shells into pork. The function of shell money in this integrated system is to transform things into people, the dead into the living, and social depletion into renewal. This personification of things and reification of human agency, in a Marxian perspective, would be tantamount to fetishizing value, which then appears as having the mysterious capacity to create value and beget children (cf. Godelier 1996:32). But as Martha Macintyre clearly saw (see Strathern 1988:171-172), whereas the fetishism of commodity separates the product from its producer by giving it an occult life of its own, the notion of the reproductive power of shell valuables reaffirms, however mystically, "the centrality of human agency in production" (1984:113). Short-term cycles of exchange articulate with long-term reproductive cycles, thus establishing, as Jonathan Parry and Maurice Bloch have observed (1990:28), a relationship between the individual human life and the enduring sociocosmic order within which that life is lived. notes Acknowledgments.

All facts relating to the Wodani are contemporary. Fieldwork was conducted in the vernacular language (which previously had never been described) without the help of interpreters. The Wodani clans among whom research was done do not speak Indonesian. All informants regarding shell money were men; women know little about this matter, and, more importantly, both my difficulties in learning the vernacular 576 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="20">and their own reluctance to engage in conversations with me made it impractical to elicit information directly from them. (For another perspective on Wodani shell money, see Breton 1999b.) 2. Land and vegetable food on one hand and incestuous sexual unions (Breton 1999a), as well as the exorcism of certain spirits on the other, cannot be bought or compensated for with shell money. 3. Contrary to what has been observed in numerous New Guinea societies, cowries are counted not by aggregate groups, sewn onto bands or tied by a string, but, rather, one by one. See Siilitoe 1979:148 for the Wola and Heider 1970:289-292 for the Dani mention the use of fathoms of cowries. About another currency, comparable to the Wodani's, see Schoorl 1993:42 for the Muyu. As for the Wodani's neighbors, see Pospisil 1963a:301-305 for the Kapauku/Ekagi and van Nunen 1973:18-20, 74-77 for the Moni allude very briefly to basically identical systems. 4. This modification of the shell, exposing the backbone, was done by Kapauku/Ekagi intermediaries who obtained cowries from the south coast (Pospisil 1963a:303-304) and then traded them with their neighbors. Old Wodani informants recall that the Dani of Ilaga came a long way to the Kemandoga Valley, in Moni territory, next to the Wodani's, to exchange stone axe blades against salt and shells with the former and against palm bows with the latter. 5. In Melanesia, it is common for shell money to be described as a human body; examples of this are to be found in New Caledonia (Leenhardt 1930:47-55) and in the Papua New Guinea highlands, among the Wiru (Clark 1991:317, 321). At Woodlark, in the Massim, money possesses a face and is connected to such an extent to the man who introduces it into the kula game that it is said to be his hand (Damon 1980a:284, 280). 6. Here again, the notion that shell money has a skin, that it has to be decorated-in the same way a human body is adorned-is a widespread feature, particularly in the New Guinea societies that use ochre-colored pearl shells (Clark 1991:315-31 7; Sillitoe 1979:142; Strathern 1971:238). 7. An example of this cocoon attached to a Manum pearl shell is shown by Lewis (1 929:fig. 21). 8. Dactylopsila palpator is a possum of the Petauridae family, characterized by a very long fourth finger enabling it to dig out the larva on which it lives (Flannery 1990:152-153, 1994:94-95). 9. Pseudochirulus caroli is a possum of the Pseudocheiridae family (Flannery 1990:164-165, 1994: 132-133). Bubada, a spirit of the Yamba class, slides a finger of this marsupial into the throat of his victim. Here, too, Yamba is associated with money through subtle suggestions. 10. The last phalanx of the fifth finger of a child is often cut at the time of birth as an act of divination: if the finger bleeds, the child will likely die. The finger is kept if the child survives. 11. Araucaria cunninghamii grows on mountain ridges and can reach 60 meters. Its rot-resistant bark is used for roofing. 12. Such a relation between the moon and the skin's condition is not uncommon in New Guinea, for instance, in Marind mythology, in which boys affected by ringworm impersonate the moon (van Baal 1966:226-227). 13. Some Tege spirits feel an aversion to money; in this way they differ from the Yamba spirits. The price for their exorcism requires necklaces of black seeds, stone taro knives, net bags, and plugs of tobacco, which protect the officiants of the rite by making them invisible to the spirit's anger. The exorcism of Tege is always paid with an even number of kipe or goods. This malevolent spirit is horrified by odd numbers. 14. This bird is also known as Amblyornis macgregoriae (Beehler et al. 1986:221, fig. 50; Coates 1990:392-397). 1 5. Having been ceremoniously exhibited in front of the ritual house for several weeks, taros are handed out by the sponsor with their stalk, for planting, at the time when the pigs are slaughtered. The regrouping of young men and women, the sacrifice of pigs, and the monetary transactions thus accompany the transfer of another type of fecundity, in this case agricultural. 1 6. The people of Gawa, in the Massim, describe kula valuables as having a metaphorical anatomy; they decorate shells with ornaments that add to their power of sexual seduction (Munn 1986:114). 17. Their classification is basically shared by the Moni (van Nunen 1973:74-75) and the Kapauku/Ekagi, judging from Steltenpool's dictionary (1969). Contrary to what can be observed in the Massim-in the kula, for example, where necklaces cannot be exchanged except for arm shells (Malinowski 1922), or on Rossel Island (Liep 1995) and among the Mono-Alu of the Solomon Islands (Monnerie 1996:63), where shells of different ranks can not be exchanged-among the Wodani kipe can be converted both within a single class and between different classes. 18. However, contrary to the 'Are'are of Malaita, in the Solomon Islands (de Coppet 1998:1 64, n. 10), there is no fixed rate of exchange between different denominations. 19. There is in this regard a contrast with many other Melanesian currencies that are distinguished by no other criteria than the class and the number of the fathoms or the pieces-for instance, those of the 'Are'are (de Coppet 1970b) or of the Tolai of New Britain (Epstein 1979). 20. The Daribi also qualify high-value pearl shells us kipe (Wagner 1978:64). 21. This is a widespread feature in Melanesia, found in the Trobriand Islands (Malinowski 1922:89), among the Melpa (Strathern 1971:236), the Wola (Sillitoe 1979:143), and the Wiru (Clark 1991:315, 318), to mention a few. The people of Gawa, in the Massim, say that the name of kula players circulates only because valued shells are named; shells without names disappear (Munn 1986:108). As among the Wodani, different shells can bear the same name, but only one of these valuables is the true one. 22. In Woodlark, in the Massim, humans have the right to bear the names of shell valuables previously acquired by their elders in the kula (Damon 1980b:193). Conversely, it is the names of the players, shell money 577</page><page sequence="21">represented by shells, that circulate in the ring. The person is the sign of money and money is the sign of the person. 23. Elsewhere in Melanesia, in New Caledonia, for instance, among the Houa'lou, who make matrimo- nial payments even in the case of sister exchange, the equivalence between bride and wealth is pushed so far that it is actually the word for money that is often given to girls as their name (Leenhardt 1930:48-49, 54). 24. Only men are compensated as victims of sorcery or murder; in theory at least, women are never killed in warfare. Women are severed from their clan body by marriage, men by murder or sorcery. The symbolic equivalence between marriage and murder refers to the fact that the unit of reference is not the individual but the patrilineal clan; its integrity as a totality is what is at stake in compensations. 25. Such an equivalence between shell money and the head is often found in Melanesia; this is the case among the Wiru, where it is the "head of all things" (Clark 1991:317). It should be remembered that capital also refers to the head, in Latin caput, although in this case it refers to livestock, not persons. 26. The backbone is paid by shells tied on a string. This is the only case of metaphorical correspondence between a body part and shell money. 27. These destroyed shells are sometimes placed beneath the buttocks of the dead. The Tolai of New Ireland seal up the anus of the deceased with shell money (Epstein 1979:160). 28. This is why it is customary that a third son, if he has no elder sisters, is made to wear a fiber skirt rather than a penis sheath while he is young, as an expression of his parents' desire for him to be given a sister-that is, shell wealth for the payment of his wife. 29. Women are almost completely excluded from shell transactions. They sometimes receive token payments in matrimonial exchanges but never the especially valuable named shells. Some of them receive shell money for ritual services; they own their own money bags and men say they are "like men." As a rule, women are wealth in the hands of men, not producers of shell wealth. 30. The penis, being a fleshy appendix, is said to be the result of the mother's agency. Although Wodani would not explicitly formulate this interpretation, I suggest that the nose as a male organ is a substitute for the penis, which is judged not worthy of monetary representation in homicide compensations. A woman's nose is thus in some sense the phallus of her father, brother, or all the males of her patrician. The nose is a sexual but not a genital organ. 31. Contrary to numerous New Guinea societies, Wodani do not compensate the matriclan for its agency in sisters' sons' ontogeny-as is the case among the Wiru (Clark 1991)-nor do they practice recruitement payments destined to put an end to the matriclan's claim on its affiliating them-as is the case among the Daribi (Wagner 1967). 32. Since they are fed by women, sows and boars alike are considered female wealth. 33. The first occurence in Melanesian ethnography of the notion of the social group as based on "common substance" is to be found in Richard Salisbury's description (1964:170) of the Siane of the Papua New Guinea eastern highlands. According to this author, substance is acquired not only through descent but also through eating food and ritual contagion, the latter modalities also being relevant to the Wodani case. Roy Wagner follows the same interpretation in his description (1967) of the Daribi. Later, while showing that the transmission of sperm was conducive to forming the social identity of the person, Gilbert Herdt (1 981:239) stresses that this substance was thought by the Sambia to be in limited quantity. The substantialist description of social groups in New Guinea allows them to be represented by body fluids as well as symbolic substances such a shells. For the Wodani, the point is not only that clan membership is gained through association with shell payments but also, and more importantly, that kipe themselves symbolically embody social substance thanks to their iconic association with matrimonial and homicide compensations. 34. Some Wodani men even say that marriage payments effectuate a transformation of the body (maternal identity) of the bride, which now belongs to her husband's clan, whereas only her eyes (paternal identity) still belong to her patrician. 35. This is of course less true for women, as they are not agents of their clan reaffiliation and are not active, or only in a minor way, in institutional payments. 36. For instance, see similar rites in Rossel, in the Massim (Liep 1989:247), or in Malaita, in the Solomon archipelago (de Coppet 1970a, 1970b, 1981, 1995, 1998). 37. Neither the bride's owner nor her husband has a comprehensive knowledge of the payments being made; some of the less important ones are dealt with in the background by parties who can reach an agreement without having to refer to them. Payments are not centralized by the parties concerned, nor is the total sum ever publicly proclaimed. A marriage is considered to be concluded when all recriminations have more or less been settled. It is, in other words, the clan that acts as a whole, without any delegation of power to particular individuals. 38. The Daribi of the highlands (Wagner 1 986:58-60) use the same expression with regard to pearl shells. In Gawa, in the Massim, kula valuables are said neither to die nor to rot (Munn 1986:60). Nancy Munn explains the symbolic immortality of the shells in terms of their capacity to create unending chains of subjective conversions in the minds of recurring partners. I attribute this immortality, in the Wodani context, to the kipe being the icon of the perpetuity of the body politic. 39. This is so despite the fact that, contrary to other New Guinea societies, no equation has been established here between shells and sperm-the substance of the paternal clan (Clark 1991:334; Godelier 1996:192; Wagner 1967:151). 578 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="22">40. The metonymic principle of division is general in Wodani compensations. For instance, the official of the exorcism of Tege is compensated for the head, the jaw, and so forth; it is the various parts of the spirit which are thus purchased. 41. The vagina at issue refers to sexual favors but also to the capital the wife represents in terms of labor and progeny (Strathern 1980:58). It is interesting to note that the Melpa and the Wodani, as we have seen with the pig of the nose, do not offset this capacity for production and reproduction with shell money but, rather, with female wealth. 42. Myths of the origin of cultivated plants grown from body parts or exuviae are common in New Guinea, for instance, among the Kiwai of the Gulf of Papua (Landtman 1917:40-41) or the Ankave (Bonnemere 1996:335-336). The Dani of Ilaga, distant neighbors of the Wodani (Larson 1987:49-50), and the Kapauku/Ekagi, close neighbors of the Wodani (Giay 1995:200-201), tell the same story of the sacrifice of the primeval ancestor whose body parts became crops. Some Kapauku/Ekagi clan names even refer to the act of dragging, splitting, and slicing his body. The symbolic equation between the cutting up of a primeval ancestor, transmission of identity, eating of vegetable food, and monetary payments seems to be a strong regional feature. 43. It is only between men that asking for food is done in such an aggressive, almost insulting manner. Van Beek (1987:154-155) reports the same type of behavior among the Bedamuni of the Great Papuan Plateau, where it is acceptable not to share something on the sole condition that it not be visible. 44. This rule contributes to the strictly dyadic character of shell money exchanges, which tolerate but two partners. It is tantamount to saying that the debt is inalienable-which renders competitive exchanges like the kula impossible for the Wodani. 45. This is also what Gawans say (Munn 1986:61, 63). 46. It is in such a way that the Ok people of Telefolmin describe their own shell valuables. The story of Afek, the great primordial ancestress, tells us how she killed her brother who had spied on her giving birth to taro. But his body would not rot, so she introduced decay into the world. The maggots that put an end to his flesh later turned into shell money. The cycle was thus complete between death, the dissolution of the body, and fertility (Brumbaugh 1990:65-66). 47. Nowadays, when available, a sum of money paid in banknotes can be used as a substitute for pork in shells-for-shell transactions. However, it never replaces one of the four required kipe. As a nonindividu- alized means of payment, modern currency can only be equated with generic meat. 48. The exchange of a kipe of lower value rarely conforms to the five-piece formalism, but traders will nevertheless insist that the children include both a male and a female shell. It also happens that a kipe of little value and of small size is left permanently as "forbidden money" or "spirit money," dedicated to Yamba, in the bottom of the sheath of a valuable shell, which is then said to "sit in its mother's lap." The small cowry is supposed to beautify its child and attract other valuables. 49. The marsupial does not have to be shared socially. If someone brought one to the village-which is rare-it would be cooked off to the side, near the edge of the fallow land, never in the earth oven where pigs are customarily steamed. 50. This is what the Mendi of Papua New Guinea think (Lederman 1986:85). 51. The tail that decorates the cowry sheath and which belongs to the Long-fingered Triok-whose flesh as I have said is forbidden to women-also adorns the head of the bow and is attached to it by the very same cocoon used as a shell money sheath. 52. According to one informant, the use of kade as a common classifier for these objects can be explained by the fact that they are all planed like planks. This is a possibility. I do not think, however, that it nullifies my interpretation; I very much doubt that the Wodani traditionally knew that kipe were cut up by Kapauku/Ekagi intermediaries and that they were dealing with manufactured objects. 53. The Houa?lou of New Caledonia go so far as to attach an ancestor's figure at one end of a shell money fathom (Leenhardt 1930:49). 54. Similarly, it was the image of a constantly rebuilt ship that, during the Middle Ages, jurists evoked to describe the immutable character of corporate bodies; when the form does not change-it was said in Aristotelian fashion-the thing itself does not change. In the same way, medieval political theology saw in subrogation and the King's Two Bodies the principle of continuity of corporations and of the State. The sovereign was symbolically endowed with two identities, two bodies, one of which-representing the immaterial and divine character of his office-never died. As Ernst Kantorowicz (1957) admirably points out, a shift was brought about in the Western theory of the State when the organic totality of individuals necessary to the formation of a communitas came to be conceived no longer in the mode of synchronic extension-like a plurality of individuals living in the same period-but in the abstract mode of diachronic succession-like a plurality of individuals engendering themselves and encompassing the dead, the living, and the unborn. Kingship and the universitates were transformed into a fictional, immaterial person, not made up of parts, and whose essence was time. This conceptual revolution opened the way to the notion of the organic continuity of the State. I suggest this comparison between Melanesia and the Middle Ages only to stress that an organicist theory of society, upheld in both cases, leads interestingly to the notion of the perpetuity of the body politic (the State or the clan) as expressed by the immortality of its symbol (the shell or the king). shell money 579</page><page sequence="23">references cited Beehler, Bruce, Thane Pratt, and Dale Zimmerman 1986 Birds of New Guinea.
