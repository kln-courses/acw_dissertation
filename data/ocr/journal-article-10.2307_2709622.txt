I can't tell; I wish she had: his book's the eleventh commandment, Which says, "thou shalt not marry," unless well: This he (as far as I can understand) meant: 'Tis not my purpose on his views to dwell, Nor canvas what "so eminent a hand" meant; But certes it conducts to lives ascetic, Or turning marriage into arithmetic. Byron, Don Juan 15: 297-304 Wollstonecraft and Malthus are virtual opposites: archetypal rebel, archetypal conservative. Malthus discharged his task of defending the status quo far more effectively than the more prestigious Burke. Burke gave conservatism its rhetoric, Malthus gave it its artillery. For Malthus produced scientific proof that altering social relations was not merely immoral, it assaulted the constitution of nature itself, thus retiring dubious arguments based on tradition to cosmetic operations. Malthus consciously assimilated his defense of the status quo to physics; and doing so, he pre- empted the language of freethinking intellectuals. "The eighteenth century took the model of Newtonian mechanism as its scientific paradigm; the Malthusian theory... was an attempt to apply this model to economics."1 He saw the nucleus of his theory as an axiom, the equivalent in moral philosophy to Newton's in natural philosophy-and equally unanswer- able. His argument was practical: based in statistics, it had an application * This paper is dedicated to the memory of F. E. L. Priestley.

By contrast Wollstonecraft was a thoroughgoing rebel-a rebel not just intellectually, like her husband Godwin, but in her life too. She was in some ways a female Byron-passionate, charismatic, and bold in both life and writing; a lover of independence and travel; a supporter of revolu- tion, democratic principles, and self-determination. She was publicly ma- ligned-as Byron was-and for similar reasons. She died at 38, he at 36. Byron died a martyr-as did Wollstonecraft, a witness to the rights of women who died from childbirth, the death no man ever faces. Her son- in-law Shelley grasped this, for the martyrdom finales of The Revolt of Islam and The Cenci, with their sense of sexual as well as social martyr- dom, imply a reference to her attempted suicide-and her actual death.3 Given such differences, it is striking that Wollstonecraft and Malthus should agree on two crucial points: sex and spirit. For both sex is danger- ous morally-and socio-politically. Both, furthermore, view the aim of the Creator as the conversion of body to spirit: "The Holy purpose to which Malthus saw the principle of population directed ... was nothing less than the transmutation of matter into mind/spirit."4 Malthus re- sponds to the idea of equality by focusing on sex and reconstituting spirit. Likewise Wollstonecraft's response to equality focuses on sex and reconstitutes spirit. In the history of ideas both display with unusual clarity the way thinkers deduce social principles from beliefs regarded as axioms embedded in the very constitution of nature itself. Hence their concerns are functions of a cosmology: a cosmology in crisis in the 1790s. Keynes's sketch of Malthus is quite wrong in seeing him as a scientific enquirer in a logical positivist mode. Despite being a bureaucrat with very practical concerns-as "professor" he taught East India Company employees how to do their job (a fact Indians should ponder)-yet Mal- thus in no way abjured metaphysics.

The specific concerns of each, preserving oligarchy in one and female emancipation in the other, involve each in an immense revision of religious, historical, and social models. The way society understands the divine is, inevitably, as a function of society itself-especially the image that society visualizes for God. This image is of more practical import than theological concepts, for religion is a social reality shared by educated and uneducated alike. The image of God as patriarch has had incalculable influence on Christianity; for many, this image is what Christianity is. Eighteenth-century attempts to reinvent God not only reconceptualized but revisualized Him. Before, in the ancien regime of the Authority-Subordinate hierarchy rooted in feudal relations, God is visualized as a bearded king on a throne in Heaven, a wise master in the mold of invincible aristocratic lord. "Subordination was indeed the very soul of order, and the Almighty as a god of order formed his earthly kingdom in a pattern of subordination."7 But in mercantile and later manufacturing culture-in "the great transformation," as Polanyi put it-new ways to visualize God emerged in accord with the growing force of commercial market principles in society. Capitalist social relations implied a god more like an engineer-a god, in Newton's words, "very well skilled in mechanics"8-a practical artisan or merchant who must plan ahead for all contingencies ("Providence"): not like a "lord" of special privilege, an absolutist god who interferes in the mechanism of nature at whim. In short, according to Margaret Jacob, "The radical mind of the eighteenth century extracted from the Scientific Revolution a reverence for and understanding of nature that rendered the God of traditional Christianity superfluous."9 5 Edmund Santurri, "Theodicy and Social Policy in Malthus' Thought," JHI, 43 (1982), 315-30. 6 See Carol Kay, "Canon, Ideology, and Gender: Wollstonecraft's Critique of Adam Smith," New Political Science, 15 (Summer 1986), 63-76; cf. Elissa Guralnick: "the Rights of Woman is a radical political tract even before it is a radical feminist tract ... the feminism [of] the Rights of Woman is merely a special instance of the political radicalism that animates the Rights of Men" ("Radical Politics in Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman," Studies in Burke and His Time, 18 [1977], 155-66); it is also a metaphysical manifesto, unlike their writings on Scandinavia. 7 Edmund S.

"The commercial system has long been undermining the distinction of ranks in society," laments Robert Southey in 1807: "Mushrooms are every day starting up from the dunghill of trade."'0 Thus the ancient belief in two levels of reality (upper/perfect world vs. lower/sinful world) collapses. Newton showed that both the aristocratic stars in the upper world above and the humble apple below act by the same equalizing laws. In this he was showing what Galileo had done when he revealed the sun to be made of the same mutable stuff as changing, fallen earth: no special dispensation for the aristocrats of nature. Commerce does not want a class of hereditary privilege: "idle people, who produce nothing in return for their consumption," as Adam Smith puts it in a passage Ricardo cites.1' For the advanced thinker an absolute monarch in heaven is no more desirable than an absolute monarch on earth-not an arbitrary god exempted by special privilege from lawful or predictable ways. A god who does miracles as violations of nature's law can hardly be God. We need a working god, one who builds and maintains the system of nature. Cleanthes crystallizes the updated god in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion-a god of the type expounded by the deist Elihu in Blake's illustrations to Job. The necessity for a "reason- able" god in what Paine called the "age of reason" arises not merely for intellectual reasons but for solid practical ones. Out of this revisualization emerges a new model of the divine-first a severe Roman-Republican deity with pure clean ethical lines and values based on reason, on respect for the individual and property. A god of freedom and equality must necessarily be impersonal-not preferring one group above another: a detached god that embodies what Godwin calls the "principle in the nature of human society by means of which every- thing seems to tend to its level, and to proceed in the most auspicious way, when least interfered with by the mode of regulation."12 In the words of the Anglican divine, Edmund Law (1745): "as we continually advance in the study of God's works, we shall come to a proportionally better understanding of his word." Burke articulates the assumption here in his Thoughts on Scarcity: the "laws of commerce" are the "laws of nature" and the "laws of nature" are the "laws of God."13 The divine is mirrored ment [New York, 1972], 44). 10 Quoted in P.

This god is an impersonal stabilizer like the Invisible Hand that harmo- nizes the chaos of the market place; indeed he personifies the market and its automatic equilibrating action. The deity (embodying Necessity, space, or natural law) is a god that people of advanced ideas can accept-mostly merchants, artisans, and a dissenting middle class. Paine shows that Re- publican values and belief in nature as a mechanism conduce to an image of God as a sort of Cosmic Energy-a divinity utterly unlike the spiteful old man he lampoons in The Age of Reason, a god suited to "Gothic" feudalism or absolutist monarchy (the god Blake called the effluvium of priest and king). J. C. D. Clark shows how Paine rooted his arguments (from Common Sense to The Age of Reason) in religion, but a religion increasingly heterodox, establishment Christianity being identified with the existing social structure, especially aristocratic privilege.'4 Similarly, "Godwin's ideas on politics represent a secularized version of the English dissenting tradition in religion."15 The point of this re-vision of God for our authors is that the ancient split between fallen and unfallen nature, between a lower world of sin, mutability, and mortality on one hand, and an upper world of permanence and authority on the other, disappears. This split has dominated Christian- ity. Two levels of nature correspond to two kinds of people-nobles and commons. Social principles are woven into the fabric of the cosmos itself: in order to function, feudalism had to have a belief such as the split between upper (unfallen) nature and lower (fallen) nature, an order of grace and an order of sin.16 The idea that all men are created equal, with liberty a natural right, expresses a need to equalize aristocrats and property-owners which in turn exerts an equalizing pressure on the two levels of reality. This impulse is not aimed at equality for all but at weakening the privilege of aristocracy over property in general: a "society which demanded formal equality but required substantive inequality of rights."17 All men are created equal-but some are more equal than others. "The phrase 'the people'... was a synonym for the middle classes and those few among the laboring masses who could demonstrate loyalty 14 English Society 1688-1832: Ideology, Social Structure and Political Practice during the Ancien Regime (Cambridge, 1985), 324-29. 15 Richard Fenn, The Spirit of Revolt (Totowa, 1986), 165. 16 This split always had political significance, even that of Being vs. Becoming in Plato; see Alban Winspear, The Genesis of Plato's Thought, 2nd ed. (New York, 1957). A subsidiary correspondence holds between males (= permanence/authority) and females (= mutability/subordination). 17 C. B.

With the two levels of reality now discarded, this must necessarily be the best possible world, not one blighted by human sin and God's wrath. The doctrine of original sin also must be jettisoned, practically if not in theory. Hume observes this shift in Dialogues Concerning Natural Reli- gion: Philo notes that divines have lately changed their tune. The old vale of tears has become the best of all possible worlds. They know how to change their style with the times. Formerly it was a most popular theological topic to maintain, that human life was vanity and misery, and to exaggerate all the ills and pains which are incident to men. But of late years, divines, we find, begin to retract this position, and maintain, though still with some hesitation, that there are more goods than evils, more pleasures than pains, even in this life. When religion stood entirely upon temper and education, it was thought proper to encourage melancholy; as indeed, mankind never have recourse to superior powers so readily as in that disposition. But as men have now learned to form principles, and to draw consequences, it is necessary to change the batteries, and to make use of such arguments as will endure, at least some scrutiny and examination.18 "Superior powers" implies aristocrats: those who extort obedience. The change-proud optimism supplants humble submissiveness-marks a shift in worldview. In creating one fitting its needs, society reconstitutes parts of the earlier worldview. What is striking about Malthus, writing in 1798, is just how far down the road of revisualizing God-and thus of reinventing the relations be- tween society and nature-he is. His language is that of the sophisticated intellectuals who realize God is not, and so cannot be visualized as, a feudal potentate in an upper-world kingdom. Population takes for granted that God is a personification of natural law. Scripture, Malthus indicates, is fine for academics. But to be serious about what God is like, we must cast "our eyes to the book of nature, where alone we can read God as he is" (my emphasis).19 Whatever is, therefore, is right. An ingenuous biographer says: "Malthus was drawn to this unorthodox conclusion by the need to reconcile the cruel general law of population with his belief 18 Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (New York, 1949), 213, my emphasis; cf. Marx on the French Revolution: its heroes "performed the task of their time in Roman costume and with Roman phrases, the task of unchaining and setting up modem bourgeois society. The first ones knocked the feudal basis to pieces and mowed off the feudal heads which had grown on it ... a century earlier, Cromwell and the English people had borrowed speech, passions and illusions from the Old Testament for their bourgeois revolution. When the real aim had been achieved, when the bourgeois transformation of English society had been accomplished, Locke supplanted Habakkuk" (The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon [Moscow, 1935], 11.) 19 Thomas Robert Malthus, An Essay on Population, ed. Philip Appleman (New York, 1977), 201 (this is from the 1803 edition).</page><page sequence="7">Sex and Spirit in Wollstonecraft and Malthus 407 in an omnipotent and loving God."20 His fascination with the new god had, like everything in Malthus, a practical base: he "was obsessed with the heuristic power and efficacy of natural theology."21 That is, natural theology is a validation device-a way of endowing authority. By identify- ing God's nature with nature, Malthus literally deifies his theorem: the population law not only has the unanswerable authority of number, it incarnates the deity. Blake satirizes this "deism" in his geometrizing deity Urizen: one begins to understand why Blake treats deism-historically a clear instance of "the liberating effect of rationalism"22-as essentially devil worship. Within the orderly structure of nature, humans are driven by self- interest. Malthus euphemistically calls it self-love. He assimilates self- interest to Newtonian physics: "self-love," he declares, is "the moving principle of society" (Marx uses the same metaphor when he speaks of finding the "laws of motion" of capitalism). It "is to the established administration of property and to the apparently narrow principle of self- love that we are indebted for all the noblest exertions of human genius, all the finer and more delicate emotions of the soul, for everything, indeed, that distinguishes the civilized from the savage state" (Malthus, 98). Self- interest is not corrupt, as in Christianity-a manifestation of the original sin that infects the will. It is the very engine of civilization: everything good, says Malthus with bold hyperbole, stems from the operation of self- interest. To doubt the privilege of self-interest is literally to blaspheme. Malthus conceived Population as an assault weapon against Godwinian benevolence-a very thin shadow indeed compared to this all-creating self-interest. Inevitably this view collides with the doctrine of original sin, which Malthus logically proceeds to redefine in a form he can use. "The original sin of man is the torpor and corruption of the chaotic matter in which he may be said to be born" (Malthus, 118). This is hardly intelligible: man is not born in chaotic matter but from the womb of woman. It is an absurd definition, for original sin is the corrupted will disseminated by birth from Adam. "Malthus constructed a theodicy without ever mentioning Jesus, perhaps because Christ saved men from sin, not laziness."23 His views, R. 20 Patricia James, Population Malthus: His Life and Times (London, 1979), 67; James portrays Malthus as a veritable saint of conscientious benevolence-genuflecting to Mal- thus being a scholarly subgenre, e.g., Santurri (n. 4 above); Ezra Talmor, History of European Ideas, 4 (1983), 121-22. 21 A.

But his "ruminations" are not casual: Malthus is attaching his theory to the updated model of God that hitherto-in Paine or the Declaration of Independence-validated equality. He appropriates the language of God- win and his type and turns it against them; he also neatly makes reason endorse attitudes otherwise indefensible. The theology provides theory, the law of population a necessary application. Deleting the split between upper and lower worlds and viewing God as a deity who gave nature its present form marked a shift from the earlier cosmology in another way as well. In the earlier model this world is only partly a creation: it was originally made by God, but His perfect creation is damaged by sin. The result of human folly, its horrors are intelligible. Malthus's project is to reconstitute the ancient split between upper and lower, fallen and unfallen, worlds-but in new terms. Instead of an eternal upper world he installs "spirit"; instead of a lower world he gives us Newtonian inert "matter" that is by nature shapeless and lazy. Like other "conservative theorists," Malthus "repudiated the notion that all men were naturally equal."25 The revised split articulated social relations bet- ter: property-owners-both commercial and aristocratic-vs. a new labor- ing class detached from traditional small-holding culture: laborers who need "checks," to borrow his power term. Malthus "work[s] with a simple view of society as divided into two classes: a small group controlling enough wealth to escape the general misery and the great mass of the laboring poor."26 Thus his spirit/matter split corresponds to those with property and those without it. Original sin becomes propertylessness. His "theology of scarcity" (LeMahieu, 467) could hardly have less to do with Christianity. Malthus was asked to delete it and obligingly did so (not all, as often assumed; see Santurri). Having done its job of validating inequal- ity, it became unnecessary. The Godwinian dragon turned out to be a harmless chameleon anyway. "The first national censuses, of 1801 and 1811 provided unassailable proof of a sharp upswing in population"-the "Essay was no longer seen as economic astrology but rather as a conven- 24 R.

Rausky, "Malthusianism and the Secularization of Jewish Thought," Malthus Past and Present, 183-93. While Malthus's theology interests scholars, few note its obvious tactical-not theological-nature. A theology that proclaims scarcity as primum mobile is simply canonized political ideology. 25 H. T.

Sex traditionally is part of fallen life and must be understood in that context. A consequence of sin, it displays the irrational impulse that human reason, damaged by the fall, is prey to. Sex is for reproduction not pleasure: "Augustine indicates that sex is a necessary evil, necessary, that is, for having children."31 Reproduction, in turn, is part of the burden woman must bear because of Eve. Sex-as-reproduction is constituted as a subordination of women; indirectly of males as sinful beings. "Christianity portrayed women as the daughters of Eve and accordingly as lacking in rational control and sexually voracious. A woman's innate interest in sex was considered not so much a matter of her sensibly seeking pleasure as giving in to self-destructive urges."32 Eve's disobedience is a revolt of appetite against reason, inferior against superior, a kind of insane attempt to reconstruct the cosmos. To visualize sin per se is to see it as sexuality; thus Milton personifies sin as a sexual female. Sexual desire is hard to control and an obvious link to the animals that Christianity declared inferior. Sex pushes the life cycle of bodily existence and is inseparable from the nauseating facts of body decay and death. The horror of sex in a worldview based on artificial creation, especially of the mechanical type crystallizing in the enlightenment, is epitomized by Yahoo sex and Gulliver's reaction to it. Foucault attributed the shift to a new scientific approach to sex. The new science did not automatically encourage equality between the sexes. Thus the microscope, a major scientific invention, was used to prove the theory that women had no role in conception.33 The idea that "the female 27 Michael Bentley, Politics without Democracy: Great Britain, 1815-1914: Perception and Preoccupation (Oxford, 1984), 20; my emphasis. 28 Alan MacFarlane, Marriage and Love in England: Modes of Reproduction 1300- 1840 (Oxford, 1986), 322. 29 Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, tr.

Medical scientists were, of course, not the only ones seeking in the eighteenth century to redefine sex roles. [It was not] that doctors alone created the new ideal of female sexual passivity (McLaren, 146). In Ruth Perry's words, "By the eighteenth century, decent women were no longer expected to enjoy their sexuality."37 The new science encouraged what Ellen Pollak calls "the myth of passive womanhood,"38 in which woman is not only a passive object of male appetite but a supply of male appetite generally: a paradigm Wollstonecraft's Vindication attacks continuously. Historians observe "a bourgeois sexual mythos whose values differed from those implicit within earlier sexual codes" (Pollak, 2), including what John Gillis calls "the triumph of new conceptions of family and sexual life among the upper classes."39 "From the mid-eighteenth century 34 Lynda Lange, "Woman is not a rational animal: On Aristotle's Biology of Reproduc- tion," Sandra Harding and Merrill Histikka (eds.), Discovering Reality: Feminist Perspec- tives on Epistemology, Metaphysics, Methodology and Philosophy of Science (Boston, 1983) 1-15. 35 Elizabeth Spelman, "Aristotle and Politicization of the Soul," in Sandra Harding and Merrill Histikka, eds., 16-26. 36 Jordanova, "Natural Facts," 42-69. 37 Ruth Perry, Women, Letters, and the Novel (New York, 1980), 151; see 137-68. 38 Ellen Pollak, The Poetics of Sexual Myth: Gender and Ideology in the Verse of Swift and Pope (Chicago, 1985), 22.

"Thou shalt not marry-except well," in Byron's words. Hence Wollstonecraft's rejection of marriage had a political (not merely sexual- personal) meaning. The new "sexual mythos" is not a "scientific" rationalizing, then, as Foucault argues. Rather, commercial relations based on individual choice come to supply the paradigm. In Stone's model ("affective individual- ism")41 the individual is freed to love and marry his personal choice, whomever he likes. Free choice is the essence of what MacFarlane terms the "Malthusian marriage system": "Marriage was not automatic, it was a choice, the outcome of cost-benefit calculations for both men and women" (MacFarlane, 321; note the commerce metaphor). Randolph Trumbach contrasts "patriarchy" in the nobility with an innovative "domesticity": "a partial egalitarianism in familial relations."42 But "domesticity" (paral- leling Stone's "affective individualism") "increased patriarchal control over women and children since men believed they could not love what they did not own. But domesticity was based on the friendship of husband and wife, and friendship, as the feminist writers said, could exist only between equals" (Trumbach, 123). Regarding sexuality in terms of ownership relations is the point: "A form of social relations which treated persons as objects."43 Loving be- comes a kind of owning, a commercial transaction based on "free" ex- change. This sounds liberating: an open exchange chosen consciously by independent individuals. People are not bound by feudal ties of fealty/ bondage but by free desire, just as one buys/sells according to free desire. But paradoxically female emancipation appears on the agenda of history just as most women are increasingly subordinated-subordinated for the same reason that weak competitors in commercial society lose even the 40 John Gillis, "Married, but not Churched: Plebeian Sexual Relations and Marital Nonconformity in Eighteenth-Century Britain," Eighteenth-Century Life, 9:3 (1985), 31- 42. 41 See The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800 (New York, 1977), 221- 69. 42 Trumbach, The Rise of the Egalitarian Family: Aristocratic Kinship and Domestic Relations in Eighteenth-Century England (New York, 1978), 122.

In a "reasonable" cosmology-one in which reality consists of material objects in space- conviction necessarily grows that the aim of existence, as Hume's Philo implies, is happiness. Happiness is in essence personal self-gratification. Such gratification is inseparable from, indeed is a synonym for, the enjoy- ing of property. "The pursuit of happiness" in practice is the pursuit of property. The dominance of commercial relations in society came to provide the paradigm of human relations generally, and specifically be- tween the sexes, with women inevitably understood as object-commodi- ties. "Women became commodities more than helpmates or independent economic actors."44 In this context sex pleasure is a mode of male gratification divorced from reproduction: "In the eighteenth century sexual continence became a predominantly female virtue" (Todd, 18). Such sexuality is fundamen- tally a purchase: one with property pays for what he buys. Sex is an exchange act, not a fertility act. It may include pleasure for both parties- as in a successful business deal-but not necessarily. Paralleling marriage with prostitution, Wollstonecraft attacked this paradigm: her "most strik- ing innovation was to introduce Maria's sexuality into the discussion.... Wollstonecraft insisted that sexual relations should never be forced by duty"-duty meaning obligation contracted by marriage. "She empha- sized motherhood over wifehood" (Smith, 192, 246): marriage is the means of reproduction and child-rearing, not the arena of contractual sex. "Population" in Malthus's text is also a codeword for sex: the result (population) stands metonymically for its cause (sex). Thus his theory of population is also a rudimentary theory of sexuality. Jacques Sole opens his historical study of sex with Malthus: the exemplar of a "christianisme oiu la chastete devient la vertu sociale essentielle" and whose defense of the status quo was identical with the repression of sex-"la joie," as Sole says sarcastically, of "un celibat prolonge."45 Malthus visualizes sex in revolutionary terms. "Population" is a force that by its very nature would shatter the world: a Blakean Ore whose yearning for self-gratification is so intense that nothing can stand against it, whatever barricades reason, religion, or authority can throw up in its path. "Marriage discipline was" not only "of great concern to the elite throughout the eighteenth century," but "From the 1790s, propertied classes listened with growing anxiety to the voices of those such as Tom Paine, who, himself illegally divorced before leaving England, praised the Native Americans for having 'no other ceremony than natural affection"' (Gillis, "Married," 33, 38). "The nexus of fears generated by the French Revolution ... significantly shaped the 44 Janet Todd, Sensibility (London, 1986), 17. 45 Sole, L'Amour en occident a l'epoque moderne (Brussels 1984), 23, 24.</page><page sequence="13">Sex and Spirit in Wollstonecraft and Malthus 413 contours of'Victorian' sexuality."46 Just as Blake's Ore unites sex appetite with revolutionary impulse and popular yearning for better life, so "popu- lation" consists of propertyless masses who own nothing but dangerous sexual-and illusory political-wishes. Only the severest counter forces, famine and epidemic, can check population's world-shattering power. Civilization thus depends on sexual repression (that is, the repression of the desire of those without property for better conditions). In this Malthus anticipates the oddly similar thinking of Freud, for whom the conflict between sex appetite and the repressive superego is the mechanism of civilization: in both, reason/control is to replace desire/appetite.47 Law- property-must hold sway over those who own nothing but their repro- ductive apparatus. "Given the natural tendency of population to increase faster than capital" in Malthus, "the only hope for real relief of poverty was a drastic reduction in the numbers of the poor" (Kanth, 52): not, as in Godwin, to alter property relations. The poor must curtail their proclivity for "reck- less breeding," as J. Banks delicately puts it.48 The laboring class can survive only by neutralizing itself as a sexual agent-metaphorically as an impulse to change reality. Their sex = insubordination: our sex privilege of property. "Critical factors in promoting rapid demographic growth were the proletarianization of the mass of producers, peasants, and artisans and their integration into an extralocal commercial system." "Proletarianization was accompanied by a reduction in age of marriage" and "rising fertility."49 Population increase resulted from social changes not caused by population at all: a byproduct of the same property relations Malthus was so anxious to deify as the inviolable construction of the cosmos. The Old Poor Law so detested by Malthus did not cause popula- tion increase-it did give modest support to the laboring class. Population was ascertained to be increasing only in Malthus's own time.50 By the revolutionary 1790s famine and epidemic had weakened, hence the "de- 46 Jeffrey Weeks, Sex, Politics and Society: Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 (London, 1981), 14. 47 Freud assumes the same kind of cosmology as Malthus, one in which capitalist property relations and Newtonian physics are identified; see Richard Lichtman, The Production of Desire (New York, 1982), 211. 48 J.

Wollstonecraft loved love: "Love is a want of my heart,"54 but she saw that sexual love as currently practiced meant subjection for women. "A heavy emphasis in the Vindication lies in devaluing passionate love."55 This devaluation informs the "Rights of Woman"-not because sex makes babies, the reason it worries Malthus-but because for men sex was co-extensive with the enjoyment of dominating. Since for women sex meant the role of masochistic arouser of male aggressiveness, sex gratification was identical with female enslavement. Woman's weakness was a precondition of men's sexual pleasure. Love became the exercise of male power, the cradle, so to speak, of tyranny: the training-medium, incitement, and occasion for male force, male greed. Female powerlessness was the inevitable concomi- tant of political tyranny-as Wollstonecraft never tires of pointing out. Sexual love was inherently physically dangerous to women. Maria, or The Wrongs of Woman "declares a woman's erotic rights": "the most important is her right not to submit to be disgusted by a brutal husband"; hence "much more of Maria is devoted to the indignities of the relations with men than to its ecstasies" (Blake, 104). Thus for Wollstonecraft sex is dangerous not as anarchic desire, a willingness to rip up the fabric of society for momentary pleasure, as in Malthus. Existing sexual practice reproduces established power relations. The task of middle class women is self-neutralization in order to maximize gratification for their husbands, very much as in Veblen, where women are a mode of conspicuous consumption: a display of male ranking as power over objects. (Neutralizing sexuality, especially female sexuality, is central to Wollstonecraft's daughter's novel Frankenstein.)

For one, sex is bad because it enforces the existing social structure-for the other, it is bad because it threatens that structure. The object of intense social anxiety, sex has become for both the enjoyment of power-but to Wollstonecraft such enjoyment is evil; to Malthus it is, for propertied men, the will of God. Whereas in Malthus sex as reproduction becomes, in effect, theft-stealing what one cannot buy-in Wollstonecraft it is a complex spiritual duty. Specific concerns for each-female emancipation in one, population in the other-require far-reaching changes in society. Malthus won, and subsequent social legislation, especially the 1834 Poor Law, reflect his program. The overt argument of the Vindication is that women's relation to men is the same sort of relation as that between commons and aristocracy. Wollstonecraft argues exactly along the lines of Tom Paine, for whom the nobility were, in his phrase, the "no-ability"-a "fungus" on the parent branch of the society of workers.56 Since all men are created equal, the hierarchic relation of king and commoner is obsolete, evil, socially corrup- tive in every way: the essence of tyranny for it infects all aspects of human life, including sexual and domestic life, as Wollstonecraft shows. She then takes this argument the next logical step: if commons and aristocrats are equal and a power-over relation based on coercion can no longer be legitimated-then neither can male tyranny and female peonization: a republic of equals with half the population essentially serfs, "like a crea- ture of another species," as Jemima says in Maria.57 As Astell complained a century before, "If all men are born free, how is it that all women are born slaves?"58 The Rights of Woman remains vital and contemporary. But in one area it is very un-modern: its obsession with God. The appeal to a Supreme Being defines Wollstonecraft's discourse. The preoccupation with God's attributes is no idiosyncrasy: as in Malthus, God makes the argument. Her God is not the male autocrat tradition venerates, an index of female enslavement.59 "God himself cannot be a tyrant ... he must be rational and virtuous, so that his character may serve as a foundation for human morality" (Guralnick, 163). "The Deity," her term for God, created in order to increase happiness. What makes one happy is virtue: virtue = happiness; and happiness = fulfilling God's will. But virtue in turn re- quires reason, for reason shows what virtue is and how to pursue it- hence the obsession of the Vindication with education. Wollstonecraft 56 Thomas Paine, Essential Works, ed. S. Hook (New York, 1969), 183, 181. 57 Maria, or The Wrongs of Woman (New York, 1975), 83. Even the rational Ben- tham-an early advocate of homosexual rights-resisted this reasoned view (Douglas Long, Bentham on Liberty [Toronto, 1977], 167; J. S. Mill was of course more receptive). 58 See Ruth Perry, Women, 22. 59 Feminists grasped this point early; see Naomi Goldberg, Changing of the Gods: Feminism and the End of Patriarchal Religion (Boston, 1979).</page><page sequence="16">416 Mervyn Nicholson insists "that education rather than nature was responsible for perceived differences of intellect between the sexes."60 Education is not merely acquiring facts, it is an expansion of consciousness that enables one to act authentically; it includes sublime emotion. This world is constituted as the locale of virtue-stimulating struggle, not of individual self-gratifica- tion. The aim is to achieve growth, not property. Wollstonecraft goes further. Reason, virtue, and education prepare us for immortality, for changing body to spirit where there is no marrying or giving in marriage. The design of creation is not happiness qua enjoying property but happiness as self-transformation. But distinction of spirit by sex is nonsensical, Rousseau and others notwithstanding. Like reason, the soul is without sex. To say "men and women are ontologically similar"61 is not quite accurate: they are ontologically identical. Hence sex is subordi- nate to life's real function, education-expanding consciousness to prepare for immortality, freedom from the body and its sexual itches and urges. Thus sex as vehicle for arbitrary power violates not only the personal integrity of women, like rape, but in fact denies God, immortality, and so the meaningfulness of existence and the very rationality now seen to constitute reality. Sex as currently practiced = personal gratification = power over others = a violation of equality before God: a metaphysical crime. The purpose of sex is not personal gratification (= male owning power) but to bond husband and wife as matrix for child-rearing, for literally the creation of immortal spirits.62 As spirits we are unsexed; in the afterlife we are not sexual beings generating more sexual beings. Since we are here to train for the next life our spirit-identity requires equalizing men and women in this life. Wollstonecraft's argument thus (1) requires God's existence, (2) makes spirit supreme over body, (3) subordinates this life to the next, hence (4) establishing the necessity of female emancipation, which begins with (5) education for women and (6) devaluing sexuality as a mode of self-gratification and marriage qua property-ownership. We need equality and emancipation in order to conform with the Deity's will.63 Thus while pietistic "religion was the basis of women's education" in her time,64 a heterodox religion was the basis of her emancipatory 60 Sara Mendelson, The Mental Web of Stuart Women (Brighton, 1987), 191. 61 Josephine Donovon, Feminist Theory: Intellectual Traditions of American Feminism (New York, 1987), 8. 62 For actual child-rearing in the age (not Wollstonecraft's proposals), see Alice Miller, For Your Own Good: Social Roots of Violence in Cruelty to Children, tr.

A Vindication's God is very anthropomorphic: He loves justice, free- dom to develop as an individual, equality; He wants us to transform ourselves to better beings, to multiply happiness. In Wollstonecraft's book on Sweden, God is a mind-expanding spiritual energy manifest in sublime nature (she "experienced ecstatic religious feelings").65 Her anthropomor- phic God modulates into a God of personal spiritual transformation. Wollstonecraft understands the new up-to-date model of God that ad- vanced, educated people of the same class as Malthus is appealing to could believe in. But she skips the phase of God conceived as Malthus does, personification of implacable physical laws. Wollstonecraft needs God because God needs the emancipation of women, just as God, in Malthus- the inexorable law of nature-needs poor people to be abandoned to poverty. If you believe in God, Wollstonecraft argues, then you must also believe in educating women and transformating society: she enlists spirit in her sexual argument. They both assume Paley's view: "a future state alone rectifies all disorders."66 Wollstonecraft's God is not as highly evolved (or devolved) on the road to personifying natural law as God emphatically is in Malthus. Her God is moving in a very different direction. God in Malthus is really a numeric formula, inscrutable exactly as natural data are inscrutable-one cannot imagine praying to it. "Man suffered; some starved, but overall there was an economy of evil as just and compensatory as the Law of supply and demand" (LeMahieu, 468). But Wollstonecraft's God de- mands struggle against tyranny and irrationality to reform society. Her son-in-law Shelley crystallizes her religious thinking in believing that the soul is immortal, that the deity is a personal power that enters one's life as moments of ecstatic or expanded consciousness, and that the aim of this power is the renovation of society. The spirit is not just an impersonal force but the will to know more and live better, an energy in one's personal 65 Emily Sunstein, A Different Face: The Life of Mary Wollstonecraft (New York, 1975), 251. 66 The Works of William Paley (London, 1825) I, 282. Significantly, Paley was a major popularizer of Malthus. His sermon "Reasons for Contentment addressed to the Laboring Part of the British Public" was published in 1792: the year of Vindication and Paine's Rights of Man, part 2. Paley's natural theology, instead of implying reform, coheres with the defense of the status quo (as the textbook use of Natural Theology [1802] at university in the nineteenth-century indicates) and even with Malthus's repressive theology. J. C. D. Clark analyzes Paley's political use of natural theology (80); see also Thomas Schofield, "Conservative Political Thought in Britain in Response to the French Revolution" (Histor- ical Journal, 29 [1986], 601-22), 605-7. The nexus of religion, natural philosophy, and defending established social relations pivots on worldview, for it is worldview that connects and integrates disparate beliefs, disciplines, and practices.</page><page sequence="18">418 Mervyn Nicholson life.67 The next step logically from Malthus's deism is atheism; in Woll- stonecraft it is a Romantic god like the "presence" of Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey or "Eternity" in Shelley's Adonais. By rigorous deduction from her image of God, Wollstonecraft reaches a concept of female emancipation hardly realized in nearly 200 years. But her sexual argument hinges on a spiritual one: immortality demands a certain kind of sexual life now. General approval met the Vindication in 1792;68 but by the time of Population (1798), things had changed: "The shift in the treatment of feminist works between 1792 and 1798 indicates the continuing approbation of improved education for women and the solidifying opposition to works that seemed to threaten the established relations between the sexes": most disturbing of all "was the attack on the sexual character of women.... Men who were glad to agree that mind is of no sex were not pleased to acknowledge that manners [i.e., power] should be of no sex." (Janes, 302). Equalizing thought became anathema. The years 1792-98 mark the end of the optimistic phase of the mechanist equilibrating cosmology and the advent of a reactionary phase of the same worldview. Natural theology now justifies the existing social structure; Malthus's economics rationalized-so as to irritate Ricardo-the unpro- ductive consumption built into that structure ("his unrelenting defence of the landlord class ... still causes one to wince today").69 Unlike Ricardo, Malthus defends hereditary landowners while showing their essential iden- tity of interest with commercial capital against a common, propertyless, potentially revolutionary enemy. An unbroken chain of deductions leads Wollstonecraft from her image of God to the emancipation of women. Similar deductive reasoning consti- tutes Malthus's thesis, again arguing from a certain kind of God. In Malthus population increase naturally exceeds increases in the food sup- ply. Food is limited not by labor but by the soil fertility: nature (deified as the will of God) forbids emancipation/equality. The incompatibility of the power to reproduce, on one hand, and the power to produce, on the other, is conveyed as a difference between geometric and arithmetic rates of increase. Harelike, population will always outstrip the tortoise-like increase of food. The argument reduces to laws of arithmetic. "There is 67 Wollstonecraft's religion-very differed from her husband's-arose from a history of female spirituality. Astell's feminism was religious. "Instead of being Eves, as in former times, symbols of sexuality and opacity through their crucial part in the myth of the fall, [women] grew into Protestant virgins, the consciences of society" (Todd 18). In the resulting "sexualization of religion," "Men become the evil sexual force in culture and women become suffering servants, guardians and emblems" (Rita Goldberg, Sex and Enlightenment: Women in Richardson and Diderot [New York, 1984], 205). 68 R.

They assimilate Malthus to his model Newton, whose numbers brooked no argument, who found a determining simplicity beneath all apparent complications. This Newtonian imperative explains why Mal- thus insists his "law" of population is not just demographic description- it determines all human phenomena: a fixed point in moral philosophy like Descartes's cogito. As the Newton of moral philosophy Malthus deduces everything from his Law, even civilization itself. The chief reason why the Law of population is so sweeping in scope is that, while conclusively limiting human reproduction, it evacuates human desire for better conditions. The most the majority can ever hope for, Malthus explains, is the state of laborers in pre-revolution America. It is no accident that Malthus dates a maximum condition to a period before revolution. Revolutionary desire is precisely what Malthus's Population is designed to abort. In a very real sense the Essay is not about demography at all: its raison d'etre is to rule out social changes of the type Godwin promoted, proving them a violation of the physical construction of nature and the will of the Deity incarnate in that construction: metaphysical crime. The role of desire is self-neutralization; in Wollstonecraft it is to transform society. For her, converting matter to spirit subverts established power relations; for Malthus, it deifies those relations. But Malthus's attack is too effective: it generates serious religious, ethical, even metaphysical problems. What sort of God commands hu- mans to be fruitful and multiply-yet arranges nature as a doublebind, implanting urges for sex while penalizing (with death, poverty, and degra- dation) those who involuntarily come into being because of this built-in "passion between the sexes"? Why did God not decrease sex appetite or provide a more enharmonic relation between production and reproduc- tion? Malthus answers: this system converts matter to spirit. The harder things are, the better the system works: by this reasoning, the worse things are, the better-and the more God likes it. The God that emerges is hardly distinguishable from a monster that enjoys his creatures' suffering: the God Blake, Shelley, and Byron satirize. It is also the kind of God who presides in the horrifying religious structures of the Gothic fiction contem- 70 Louis Dumont, From Mandeville to Marx: Genesis and Triumph of Economic Ideol- ogy (Chicago, 1977), 172-73. 71 Frederick Rosen, "The Principle of Population as Political Theory: Godwin's 'Of Population' and the Malthusian Controversy," JHI, 31 (1970), 33-48.</page><page sequence="20">420 Mervyn Nicholson porary with Malthus: imaginative illustration of the religious crisis Mal- thus himself implies. To solve the problem he creates for himself, Malthus argues the pur- pose of creation to be the conversion of matter to spirit. This trendy notion that God wants humans to cease being material and become mind, is an ideological rabbit pulled out of a metaphysical hat. Its absurdity is plain when translated from theory to actual practice. Thus: restraining sex is the grand design of creation. Conversely, the having of children by rich people advances the conversion of matter to mind that God designs. The rich are more spiritually evolved than the poor. Property is index of spirit: the propertied may indulge ad libitem. "The profane and secular have become, in a word, sacred."72 The reward for property-for spirit-is personal gratification, especially sex. Again, ideology is inscribed in the metaphysics of creation. Unlike modem Malthusians, Malthus hated con- traception,73 as the fifth edition makes clear (Banks, 19-20). Birth control is worse than the famine, plague, and war that population causes and that he imagines with intense rhetorical relish (see the apocalyptic fantasia on Famine [Malthus, 57]). Contraception would short-circuit the power relations in society (no doubt one reason why it was resisted so intensely), allowing people to have sex and democratized property relations. Interestingly Byron made Malthus a significant target in Don Juan; he appears as one more figure in its huge cast. For Byron Malthus is, like all pious, self-righteous people in his work, a hypocrite: indeed, a byword for hypocrisy. "Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes" (12:160). Preaching frustration to check population, he practices sexual intercourse so avidly as to produce numerous offspring. This attack seems lame. After all, Malthus did not say Do Not Have Children, but Do Not Have Chil- dren You Can't Afford: " 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well"--as Byron put it, "the eleventh commandment," recognizing Malthus's ideological importance. This harmless-sounding advice is in fact the heart of his satire. For Malthus imposes frustration on the majority, and extends license to the rich. His commonsense advice not to have children you can't afford is really a shocking, mercenary vulgarity-essentially prostitution, where sex, if you can pay, is always available. "Malthus preferred vice to babies" (James, 124). Property-ownership licenses sex gratification, and spirit identity. The apparatus about God in Malthus is an elaborate blind, a red herring to distract attention from the injustice of existing conditions. Belief is still vital-but as what I called a validation device, a way to valorize an argument or social practice. Malthus needs God to rationalize 72 Rita Goldberg, Sex and Enlightenment: Women in Richardson and Diderot (New York, 1984), 205. 73 James, 388-98; see Charles Kegel, "William Cobbett and Malthusianism," JHI, 19 (1958), 348-62.</page><page sequence="21">Sex and Spirit in Wollstonecraft and Malthus 421 a ghastly system. In Wollstonecraft God is also a validation device, a means to sustain the argument: He is needed to make necessary the educating and freeing of women. Malthus's God is deconstructible-a God whose purpose is to paper over the suffering that so obviously fasci- nated Malthus. Two Gods emerge: his justifies existing power relations, hers struggles against such relations. Today his God is extinct. But hers anticipates liberation theology, a God whose "preferential option" is for the oppressed. The only God visible in The Wrongs of Woman is the power to endure, "the will to struggle" that typified Wollstonecraft,74 to struggle on even in apparently hopeless conditions: a conviction that, one day, things will be better.

Maria or The Wrongs of Woman shows Wollstonecraft's growing awareness that "the oppression of women is related in theory as well as in practice to the oppression of other groups" (Spelman, 18): the underside of Malthus's equations: spirit = property-ownership = divine authority (= males); whereas women = objects = inert matter = the torpor of original sin = sexual reproduction (owned by males) = object of repression = laboring class.</page></plain_text>
