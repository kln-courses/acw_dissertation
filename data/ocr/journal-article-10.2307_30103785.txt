<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EARLY CYCLADIC SETTLEMENT' (PLATES 5-31) INTRODUCTION THE important prehistoric site of Akrotiri on Thera is mainly known from its last phase of occupation, dated to the early part of the LC period (LC I). However, the systematic research of its copious amounts of pottery sherds from 1985 onwards has brought to light a SAll the figurines discussed here are stored at the site of Akrotiri on Thera, except 534 and o1041, which are exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. Many warm thanks are due in the first place to the director of the excavations at Akrotiri, Professor C. Doumas, for generously assigning me the study and publication of this important material as well as for permission to use drawings and photographs from the archives of the excavation. Special thanks should also go to the director of the National Archaeological Museum, Dr K. Demakopoulou, for permission to study the two figurines exhibited there and for photographs of these from the photographic archives of the museum. My warmest thanks go to the UK Editor, Dr Christopher Mee, for his willingness to consider this article for publication in the Annual as well as to the anonymous referee for his invaluable comments and most useful suggestions. The cleaning of the naturalistic figurines unearthed from the structure in Cenotaph Square in 1992 was meticulously done by the conservator Mrs Ritsa Papadima. The drawings of the figurines I265, 1658, I859, I86o, 1885, I886, x954, 1979, 1981, 1982, 6792, 6797, 6798, 68o6, 6816, and 6817 were made by Ms Olga Apergi, while those of the figurines 1962, 6815, 6818, 6820+6859, 6821, 6828, 6829+6830, and 6858 were made by Mr Andreas Kontonis. The photographs of the figurines 547, I309, 1762, x1928, 1962, 2684, 3072, 624o, 6792, 6797, 6798, 68o6, 6815-21, 6828-3o, 6858 and 6859 were taken by Mr Yiannis Sarakinnis.

The excavation in recent years in Cenotaph Square, in particular in the structure SE of pillar pit 17 in 1992, as well as at Xeste 3 and Xeste 4, brought to light twenty-one new EC figurines,9 which, taken together with the other already known or completely unknown Akrotiri material, raise the number of the EC idols from the site to thirty-seven. These constitute an important body of evidence from various points of view: first, because they strengthen our impression from the very beginning that Akrotiri was not only quite a sizeable but also a flourishing settlement already in the 3rd millennium BC; second, because they come from a systematic excavation, by contrast with a large mumber of EC figurines which, being products of illicit excavations, are for ever deprived of the invaluable information which they offer when unearthed by the archaeologist's pick and, therefore, can be seen simply as works of art; and third, because, including types and showing features up till now rarely seen or even completely unknown in the Cyclades and the Aegean, they enrich our knowledge of the EC figurative sculpture and offer us the possibility of drawing a number of inferences. The Akrotiri figurines comprise a wide range of types, both schematic and naturalistic, covering almost the whole of the known EC sculptural repertoire and also introduce types which are entirely new (TABLE I). The terminology used in this article is a combination of the terms used by Renfrew and Thimme in their fundamental works on the classification of the Cycladic figures according to types assigned to separate phases of the EBA. In Renfrew's classification'0 the EC idols are divided into five basic forms: the schematic, the Plastiras type, the Louros type, the folded- arm, and the 'hybrid' figurines. He further distinguishes eleven varieties of the schematic and 2 P. Sotirakopoulou, 'The earliest history of Akrotiri: the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age phases', in D. A. Hardy and A. C.

Thimme" adopts a rather different basic division into schematic, Plastiras, Louros, precanonical, canonical, and postcanonical types, and hybrid and transitional forms. The canonical is the standard type of the standing female figure, with arms folded right below left; the precanonical does not yet exhibit all the features of the canonical idol but may be recognized as its forerunner; the postcanonical idols are the supposedly late examples, which have abandoned the strict canonical arm-position. Thimme further divides the schematic figures into a schematic and an abstract-schematic group; the former group includes the figurines " Thimme, ibid. 415-99.</page><page sequence="4">IIO PANAYIOTA SOTIRAKOPOULOU which have one or two important features of the canonical idol, such as head, arms, or legs; the latter group includes the figurines which exhibit none of these features. The EC figurines from Akrotiri are considered in the six sections which follow. First, the catalogue is presented, on both typological and chronological criteria, as defined by Renfrew and Thimme; this comprises the description of the material, first the schematic and then the naturalistic figurines, the citing of the known parallels for each type as well as comments on certain typological features and peculiarities and on chronology. There follows a discussion of certain matters of technique and manufacture ensuing from the study of the Akrotiri figurines; such matters are the occurrence of figurines made of materials other than marble, the traces of ancient mending preserved on four of them, the possible use of paint noticed on two, the system of proportions employed in the naturalistic idols, and the validity of the various schemes proposed, as well as the possibility of identifying the hands of individual sculptors and their origin. The next section is devoted to the excavation data: the conditions of finding of the figurines are followed by observations regarding their distribution in the LC settlement and the concentrations they form as well as by reference to their fragmentary state of preservation and to the various explanations offered in similar cases. In the following section, interpretation of the finds is attempted on the basis of both tlhe excavation data and the various views proposed. The structure of Cenotaph Square and its contents are discussed in a separate section, on the ground of the importance of the find; first, the excavation data are presented in every possible detail and then interpretation is attempted on the basis of present evidence. In the final section, the conclusions drawn from the treatment of the various aspects of the material are set out in brief. CATALOGUE SCHEMATIC FIGURINES Pebble type In the pebble type have been classed the very simple flat pieces of marble with an oval or irregular oblong shape.

Two of the figurines described above bear clear traces of artificial working (1762, 6240), whereas the two others seem to be completely natural. The former two are true examples of the pebble type, whereas the two others can be considered as variants of the standard form. None of them is of marble; two are of white tuff (1762, 624o), one is of white limestone (1928) and the other is a natural sea- pebble (3072). Schematic figurines of the pebble form, either natural or artificially worked, are seen in the Cyclades since the LN period, but are more common in the EBA. Marble examples of the type are reported from Saliagos near Antiparos,'2 from a grave on Antiparos'3 and from T 35 at Kampos Makris on Naxos.'4 In addition to these, Tsountas reports three flat pebbles, probably representing figurines, from T i37 at Zoumbaria on Despotikon,'s whereas Caskey finds no reason to regard as 'idols' eight smooth or flat pebbles from Ayia Irini on Kea and confines himself to calling them 'implements'.'6 Schematic figurines 1 J.

Though it does not find exact parallels in the Aegean, one can point out certain resemblances to other schematic idols from the Cyclades and Crete. In terms of body shape it can be compared with the Cretan figurines of the Agios Onouphrios type, with their broad and short bodies, the sloping shoulders projecting sideways to indicate the arms and the rudimentary rendering of the legs by means of short stumps; these, however, have a clear indication of the head and neck and seem to date to the EM II period." Figurines somewhat similar to the Agios Onouphrios type are also known from Troy III and VIIa.23 Furthermore, a similar schematized rendering of the upper and lower limbs by means of rudimentary protrusions is seen on four figurines dated to the EC I period, three of them of unknown provenance, the fourth allegedly from the Trapeza cave in Crete.24 An also similar schematized rendering of the legs is seen on a figurine from the LN settlement at Saliagos near Antiparos.25 Finally, schematic idols with barely defined heads, which rest directly on the shoulders without an intervening neck, just as in the case of the Akrotiri figurine 3072, are seen in Crete in the EM I period.26 Outside the Aegean, a stone figurine which is very similar to the Akrotiri idol is known from the Neolithic IA settlement at Khirokitia in Cyprus.27 As to the figurine I928, this has been classed in the pebble form on the ground of its outline, though it presents features, such as the slightly backward-tilting upper part and the prismatic formation of the front, which are not seen in this type (the pebble figurines are, as a rule, thin and flat). These features, however, do not constitute a reason for dating 1928 later than the late EC I or the transitional EC I-II phase, for both of them are seen on the figurines of the Louros type;28 these in certain cases have a '7 S.

The figurines classed in this type are flat pieces of marble shaped to give a vaguely anthropomorphic outline.

This feature is rare but not quite unknown in the EC I idols; it is seen on a marble figurine of the shouldered form which is of unknown provenance44 as well as in a marble figurine of the notch-waisted type from Phylakopi on Melos.45 Even earlier than this, the feature is seen on the marble violin-shaped figurine from the Neolithic settlement of Saliagos near Antiparos46 and on the fiddle-shaped idols of clay from Neolithic Knossos.47 Spade type In this type have been classed a few flat marble figurines, which consist of a more or less rectangular or trapezoidal body surmounted by a long prong. 14. 1885 (FIG. 4, PLATE 9 a).

The only case in which a spade-type figurine has come from a known context is T 103 at Pyrgos on Paros,48 where, on the basis of its correlations with thirteen other schematic idols and a clay jar with a truncated conical neck and incised decoration, it is dated to EC I. Another spade-shaped figurine is reported from T 3 at Markopoulon in Attica,49 two have allegedly been found in a grave near Marathon, together with two marble spherical pyxides 'of Keros-Syros date',50 and two others are of unknown provenance.5' A schematic idol of a somewhat similar shape reported from the Agios Onouphrios deposit is also classed by Branigan in the spade type and considered by him to be a Cycladic import.51 The spade-like figurines are generally dated to EC 1.53 Thimme, however, dates the two examples of the type said to have been found in the grave at Marathon to EC II, on the ground of their correlation with the two marble spherical pyxides, while another figurine of unknown provenance he dates to EC II-III, on the ground of its somewhat slack outline.54 Getz-Preziosi disputes Thimme's late dating of the two figurines from Marathon, as she considers it by no means clear that these were found with the marble pyxides.55 On the other hand, however, she reports two tiny spade-shaped figurines of lead (?) from Aplomata on Naxos, apparently from an EC II context.56 43 Phylakopi, 194, pl. 39. 3; Figurines, 25, 'Phylakopi 3'; Emergence, 578, pl. 8. 5. 44 Thimme, in Art and Culture, 433, no. 51. 45 Phylakopi, 194, pl. 39. 7; Figurines, 25, 'Phylakopi 7'; Emergence, 578, pl. 8. 3. 46 Evans and Renfrew (n. 12), 63; fig. 76.

The type is fairly well distributed in the Cyclades and is found in marble and in shell; it is mainly known from the cemetery at Chalandriani on Syros,79 but it has also been found in Paros,so in Naxos,8' in Keros82 and at the settlement of Skarkos on Ios.8A3 The figurines of the Apeiranthos type are almost unanimously dated to the EC II period,84 except that Thimme suggests dating them individually to EC I-II, EC II, or EC II-III, as the case may be.5 The schematic figurine of shell from Kapros Grave D on Amorgos Renfrew classed in the Apeiranthos type of the 'Keros-Syros culture' (EC II),86 whereas Thimme described it as an abstract- schematic figurine with a violin-shaped but not clearly delineated body and, on the ground of its associated finds, he dated it to the 'Grotta-Pelos phase' (EC I).87 Renfrew, who originally proposed the dating of the Kapros Grave D to the very end of the EBA or the Amorgos group' of the 'Keros-Syros culture',88 later accepted Thimme's view and dated the finds from this grave towards the end of EC I, and hence within the range of the 'Kampos group'.89 The placing of the schematic figurine in question among the examples of the Apeiranthos type seems to be valid on typological criteria (some indication of the head, both when viewed from the front and in profile, backward-tilting head and neck, shape of the body). As to the dating of the grave, the presence of two precanonical figures in it,9o the second of which is placed by Thimme himself in EC I-II, suggests a date slightly later than EC I, that is to the transitional EC I-II phase. Three schematic figurines of the Apeiranthos type are known to have come from the mainland: two from the Agios Kosmas cemetery (T 3 and T 22),9' and one from the cemetery at Manika in Euboia 78 Ergon 1992, 78.

Getz-Preziosi agrees with Renfrew that only in the EC II period do the schematic statuettes exhibit a simple head.94 Thimme, on the other hand, does not accept that the suggestion of the head is a convincing reason to consider such schematic figurines as belonging to the Apeiranthos type of the 'Keros-Syros culture'; on the contrary, he regards them as hybrid and transitional forms typical of the 'Grotta-Pelos phase' and dates them to the EC I period.95 The figurine from T 3 at Agios Kosmas, however, is dated on the basis of its correlations to the EH II period.96 As regards the Akrotiri figurine 6817, this is the only--to my knowledge--currently known case in which a rim fragment of a marble bowl has been transformed into a schematic figurine. We know of isolated cases of ingenious salvaging of broken sculpture by means of reworking and not through repair,97 but we are not aware of another case like that of the Akrotiri figurine. This then is one more proof in corroboration of Getz-Preziosi's statement that 'marble objects were neither discarded necessarily nor always left in their broken state when damaged beyond repair'.98 If this was the prevalent tendency, it goes without saying that it would hold good for Akrotiri in particular, as Thera is one of the few Cyclades which lack good white marble.99 Phylakopi I or Ayia Irini type To this type belong a small group of schematic figurines with a body almost triangular in shape, short triangular or longer trapezoidal arm-stumps at the shoulders and a trapezoidal prong in place of the head and neck, which have come from the homonymous sites of Phylakopi on Melos'Ia and Ayia Irini on Kea.'a' Though virtually identical, the figurines from these two sites differ in that the latter are flatter, thinner and of a rather cruciform appearance compared with the former. 19. 1859 (FIG. 6, PLATE 0IO d).

The four figurines from Akrotiri on Thera described above combine features of both the Phylakopi and Ayia Irini idols; even so, the first two (x859, 6798) stand typologically closer to the Phylakopi examples, while the other two are closer to those from Ayia Irini. In the Phylakopi I type have also been classed two figurines of unknown provenance in the Goulandris collection, the one of them with schematized legs.'04 Related more to the Ayia Irini idols than the Phylakopi ones is a flat cross-like figurine of white limestone coming from Tholos A at o03 Ergon I992, 78; Doumas 1992 (n. 9), 181, pl. 77 y. 1o4 D-G 1978, I45 6, nos. 167-8; D-G 1983, 162, nos. 204-5.</page><page sequence="17">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA 123 Platanos in Crete.'o5 Branigan thinks it likely that this is an actual import from the Cyclades, probably Melos itself,Io6 whereas according to Sapouna-Sakellarakis it finds parallels in the western Mediterranean and is connected with most naturalistic figurines of Cyprus, in particular Erimi, during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods.'07 As regards the dating of these figurines, Renfrew notes that at Phylakopi they were not found in contexts earlier than the 'Phylakopi I culture' (EC III), thus he thinks it probable that the form belongs to this period and in this he is followed by the other scholars.108 J. L. Davis, following Rutter's dating of Phylakopi I to the MC I period,'09 also places the production of figurines of the Phylakopi I type after the EC period."0 Barber and MacGillivray, finally, at first even doubted whether the figurine illustrated as type VII by Renfrew is in fact so early as EC IIIB (Phylakopi I)."' Later, however, Barber accepted Renfrew's dating of the Phylakopi I figurines to EC IIIB."2 At Ayia Irini the situation is perhaps different. Caskey is explicit in stating that not one of the figurines of this type was found in a deposit older than LM IB/LH II; thus he considers them as a special class of figures made probably at Ayia Irini in the LBA, in accordance with a local preference."3 In view of Caskey's assertion, Renfrew, though at first writing that the late contexts of the Ayia Irini pieces do not necessarily imply that they are of LBA manufacture,"~4 later accepts the possibility that they are of a later date than the Phylakopi ones."5 The Akrotiri examples cannot offer a solution to the problem of the chronology of these figurines, since all of them have come from later contexts, that is from the destruction layers of the last phases of the city; but this is the usual case for the majority of the EC finds presently known from this site."6 The cross-like figurine from Tholos A at Platanos in Crete Branigan dates to EM III or MM I,"7 whereas Sapouna-Sakellarakis dates the Tholos A to EM II-MM II."a Schematic figurines ofpeculiar forms 23. x86o (FIG. 7, PLATE 12 a-b).

The latter feature is characteristic of the canonical figures of the EC II period. In terms of outline, the figurine in question may be compared with an unfinished schematic figurine of unknown provenance in the Goulandris collection, which is dated to the 'Syros group' (EC II).I2o The Goulandris figurine also has a head set on the shoulders without a neck, just as x86o. The difference between the two lies in the fact that the latter has a more or less flattened head and a rudimentary rendering of the facial features by means of incisions, whereas the former has an almost spherical head devoid of facial features. The placing of the head on the shoulders without the intervention of a neck, and the separation of the head from the body by means of a double horizontal line or groove, are seen on two schematic '120 D-G 1968, i5, col. no. 209; D-G 1978, 68, no. 62; D-G 1983, 94, no. 87.</page><page sequence="19">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA 125 figurines from Euboia, the one from a grave at Manika'2I and the other from Magoula;'12 the former was found with associations dating to EC I-II or EC II,"23 the latter came from a not very clear context but containing EC II pottery too. The same features are also seen on three schematic figurines from Crete, dated the former to EM III-MM I, the two others to EM II."24 Finally, the bulging of the lower part on the front view of the Akrotiri figurine, evidently to indicate the bulk of the thighs or legs, is also seen on some figurines of the Louros type.'25 These, as already said, are dated to the later part of EC I or the transitional EC I-II phase.126 For all the reasons set out above the Akrotiri figurine I86o must be dated to EC II, or the transitional EC I-II phase at the earliest. 24.

Tripartite figurine. Trapezoidal head, flat on top.

The right arm-stump is a bit narrower and placed somewhat higher than the left. The lower part of the body elongated ellipsoid. EC I-II. x886 can be classed as a hybrid Louros/schematic figurine, with a head and upper body resembling the figurines of the Louros type and a schematic lower body. The trapezoidal head reminds one of certain Louros-type figurines"27 except for its markedly angular outline. The particularly short upper body, which virtually consists of two opposite triangular protrusions indicating the arms, is also seen on some figurines of the Louros type.'28 Besides these, the elongated schematic lower body can be compared in terms of its ellipsoid outline to the lower body of a Louros type figurine,'29 apart from the vertical groove on the latter which indicates the schematized legs. There are other hybrid figurines too combining a Louros-type head and upper body with a schematic lower part, but these also have a tall neck;'30 among these, x886 stands closer, from every point of view, to a figurine of unknown provenance dated to EC I-II, but this, except the long neck, also has a straight lower edge.'a' x886 also has a strong resemblance to the Neolithic figurines of white stone from Dhimini in Thessaly,'32 which are believed to have served to a certain degree as prototypes for the figurines of the Louros type;'33 their only difference from the Akrotiri figurine is that the Dhimini ones have a tall neck. The Akrotiri figurine, finally, has similarities to a marble schematic figurine from the cave of Trapeza in Crete,'34 such as the short upper body, virtually consisting of two triangular arm-stumps, the elongated ellipsoid lower body and the placing of the head directly on the shoulders without the intervention of a neck. The main difference between the two figurines lies in the outline of the head, which in the Trapeza figurine is horseshoe-shaped. The hybrid figurines are variously dated to EC I or the transitional EC I-II phase.'35 On the basis of what was said above and the resemblances of i886 to the Louros-type figurines a dating to EC I-II for it seems to be reasonable.'36 121 G.

These five figurines from Akrotiri are not only unusual but also unique in the Cyclades. This, taken together with the fact that three of them (i762, i86o, x886) have been made of a local material, namely white tuff, speaks in support of the view that they constitute purely Theran types. NATURALISTIC FIGURINES Plastiras type Named after the site of a cemetery on Paros, the Plastiras type of the EC figurines constitutes a distinct class and the earliest attempt at the naturalistic representation of the human figure during the 3rd millennium BC. The distinguishing characteristics of this type are the standing posture, the placement of the arms above the waist with fingertips meeting, the separately worked legs and the keen attention to anatomical detail, both on the face and on the body. 25. 6818'138 (FIG. 8, PLATE 13 a-d).

The neck long, cylindrical, slightly tilting forwards; its upper end, where a small bit from the base of the missing head is discernible, is so flat and smooth that seems to have been caused by the deliberate use of some tool for cutting off the head. The torso rectangular up to the hips, with rounded sloping shoulders. The prominent pointed breasts are placed at a normal position on the chest. The upper arms as well as the forearms are markedly separated from the torso by means of round cut-outs. Only the hands have been hastily incised on it, with unnaturally long fingers, five on the right and four on the left hand, meeting right below the breasts. The belly imperceptibly swollen. The inguinal lines are shown by the raising and carving of the thighs at their juncture with the torso. The sex is not clearly indicated. The shallow groove indicating the spine continues downwards as a dividing line between the buttocks and the upper part of the thighs. The legs are worked separately below the pubis. The kneecaps are slightly prominent. Hips, buttocks, and calves are markedly curvaceous both when viewed from the front or rear and in profile. EC I. 29. 6829142 (FIG. II, PLATE 18 a-d).

Although, when putting 68g29 on to the neck of 6830, the latter appears to be by 0.5 mm wider than the former (the diameters being 12.5 mm and 13 mm respectively); this is perhaps due to the loss of some tiny bit of marble during the cutting off of the head and to the consequent smoothing of the surface.

Three of them are male figures (68i8, 682o, 6858), one is female (6830), two are heads (6828, 6829), the latter of which probably belongs together with the female figure 683o, and two are lower legs, one left and one right (6819, 6859), the latter of which seems to belong together with the male figure 6820. Thus, the number of the Akrotiri Plastiras-type figurines amounts to six. These constitute important new material, as they show a number of unusual or quite new features which add to our knowledge of this distinct class of figurines and of the EC sculpture in general. To begin with, the fact that three of them are males raises not only the percentage of the male Plastiras figures, which is in any case relatively high in comparison with the other types of the EC figurines,'55ss to about 25% of the total (ten or eleven out of forty-two), but also the number of male EC figures in general, which, compared to that of the females, is strikingly small. Moreover, the Akrotiri male figurines of the Plastiras type show Getz-Preziosi's remarks about their difference from the females in body structure'56 not to be valid in all cases, for the three Akrotiri examples are equally broad through the hips and equally narrow through the waist as the female figurine 6830; in addition to this, the male figure 6858 has breasts equally prominent as a female and a belly which is more swollen than that of the female 683o and equally swollen as that of the Akrotiri female figure of the Spedos variety 2684 (PLATE 25 a-d) to be discussed below. The prominent breasts and the relatively swollen belly are rare but not completely unknown features in the other male figures of the Plastiras type; they are both seen on a male figurine reputedly from Amorgos,x57 while the swollen belly alone is seen on another male figure of unknown provenance.'58 In the case of the Akrotiri female figure of the Spedos variety 2684, the comparatively swollen belly, in combination with the slightly arched forearms, seems, according to the prevailing view,'59 to indicate pregnancy. The fact, however, that an almost equally swollen belly is also seen on the three male Plastiras figures previously mentioned raises the question whether this feature must in all cases be interpreted as an indication of the pregnant state. The indication of pregnancy seems to be undoubted in the cases that the belly is markedly swollen'6a and may hold good for certain others, even if the swelling is not that marked. In some cases, however, the relatively swollen belly may simply indicate the corpulence of the depicted figure, whether male or female.

This is an unusual feature not only in the male figurines of the Plastiras type but in the EC male figures in general.'6a' On the other hand, the representation of males in ithyphallic state is quite usual in the Neolithic clay figurines of Thessaly.I62 The similar representation of the Akrotiri male figurines of the Plastiras type can, thus, be considered as a survival of such Neolithic models.'63 This is in accordance with the unanimously accepted view that the standing posture and the arm-position of the Plastiras-type idols originated in Aegean Neolithic prototypes.'64 Another point, finally, which we consider worthy of particular mention is the marked separation of the upper arms from the torso seen on the Akrotiri figurines 6818, 682o, and 683o. The separation of the upper arms from the torso is a feature also seen on three other figures of the Plastiras type, two of them reputedly from Amorgos, the third of unknown provenance;'65 in these cases, however, it is merely indicated by means of two small round holes or narrow slots, whereas on the Akrotiri figurines it is marked and shown by means of round or ellipsoid cut-outs. Precanonical figurines The precanonical figurines constitute a small group, numbering until quite recently twenty-three examples, which Thimme and Getz-Preziosi recognized as typologically preceding the true folded-arm figures of the EC II period and representing a transitional form from the Plastiras to the canonical type with folded arms;'"66 thus, while retaining features reminiscent of the Plastiras type, at the same time they exhibit characteristics, in particular the hesitant beginnings of the folded-arm position, which foreshadow the classical folded-arm type.'67 On the basis, then, of typological criteria the precanonical figures have been dated towards the end of the EC I period or to the transitional EC I-II phase.'"68 33. 6815169 (FIG. 12, PLATES 21 a-d, 22 a-d).

Only three precanonical figures have come from systematic excavations, one from the cemetery at Manika in Euboia'7' and two from the cemetery at Aplomata on Naxos.'72 Of the rest, one is reported from Paros, two from Melos, and four allegedly from Amorgos; the others are of unknown provenance.

These, discovered in 1992 together with the six whole and fragmentary Plastiras-type idols previously discussed, are equally important finds as they present unique features, especially as regards the arm-position, which constitute important new evidence in support of the long ancestry of the EC figurative sculpture and its indigenous character. The figurine 6815 is a good example of the mixing of features and the transitional nature of the precanonical figures. The backward-tilting head,'74 which turns slightly to the left and is devoid of the details seen on the Plastiras idols, is, as a whole, reminiscent of the canonical folded-arm figures.

The slightly recessed pubic triangle and the raising and carving of the thighs at their juncture with the torso are features which are sometimes seen already on the Plastiras type'75 as well as on the precanonical figures'76 and considered to foreshadow the canonical figures of the Kapsala variety.'77 The rendering of the legs so as to be held together at the thighs and worked separately below the knees constitutes a feature characteristic of the precanonical figures.'78 The forearms, finally, can be somewhat parallelled in four other precanonical figures as regards their almost triangular shape;I79 the arm-position, however, cannot. Strikingly enough, a similar position of the forearms is seen on a Neolithic figurine allegedly from Schinoussa,18o a fact corroborating Thimme's view that the folded-arm arrangement of the EC canonical figures ultimately stemmed from Cycladic Neolithic models.'8' The figurine 6821 is in every respect similar to the Plastiras-type idols, in particular to those from Akrotiri discussed above (head modelled in the round, hollowed ears,'g8 marked separation of the upper arms and the upper part of the forearms from the torso by means of ellipsoid cut-outs, broad hips, complete separation of the legs from the crotch, markedly curvaceous forms both when viewed from the front or rear and in profile, standing posture), except for the position of the forearms. A somewhat similar arm-position is seen on two other precanonical figures;'83 it is striking, however, how great the similarity is between the Akrotiri figurine and the silver figurine from Hasanoglan'84 not only as to the position of the forearms but also as to the rendering of the arms and hands and the marked separation of the arms from the torso. This observation, taken together with the similarity of 6815 to the Neolithic figurine from 'Schinoussa' as regards the arm-position, confirms Thimme's and Hockmann's view that the Hasanoglan figurine, considered by Renfrew to have served as a prototype for the folded-arm arrangement of the EC canonical figures,'85 appears in fact to reflect Aegean influences which penetrated as far as Central Anatolia and that the canonical idol-type evolved within the Cyclades.'86 Canonical figurines ofthe folded-arm type Kapsala variety The Kapsala variety has been named after the site of a cemetery on Amorgos. Being the most rounded and comparing most closely in its style with the Plastiras type of the EC I period, it seems to be the earliest of the different varieties of the folded-arm figurines.'87 35. 68i6'~88 (FIG. 14, PLATE 24 a-d).

Trapezoidal upper torso, slightly forward-tilting. Slightly sloping angular shoulders, the right broader than the left. The breasts prominent, placed rather high on the chest. The upper arms are held close to the sides of the torso and made the left wider than the right on front. On the rear, they are both made wider than in front and separated from the torso by wedge-shaped grooves. The forearms, folded against the stomach right below left, are slighty arching and modelled in relief; the left forearm does not meet the right upper arm. The belly is swollen. A slightly curving incision at hip-level and the incised inguinal lines form a broad pubic triangle, which is bisected at its apex by the continuation of the leg-cleft. The shallow groove indicating the spine continues downwards between the buttocks, which are indicated by an angular projection and set off by an horizontal incision. The legs, held together and slightly bent at the knees, are separated by a deep cleft perforated between the calves. Hips and legs have a gently curving outline. Knees and ankles are marked by incisions. The feet point downward and outward at an angle. EC II. The numerous figurines belonging to this variety are particularly frequent in Naxos, but have also been found in most of the other Cycladic islands (Kea, Syros, Paros, Despotikon, Ano Kouphonissi, Herakleia, Keros, Amorgos, Ios, Melos, Thera) as well as in Crete (Koumasa, Archanes?'99) and the Greek mainland (Agios Kosmas, Vrauron, Euboia, Elis). The Spedos variety figures are dated to the EC II period, from close to the beginning to the end of this period.20oo On the basis of its particular morphological characteristics, the figurine 2684 from Akrotiri on Thera can be classed either in the 'middle' or 'middle-to-late' Spedos variety as defined by Thimme20' or in the 'late group' of the variety as defined by Getz-Preziosi.2o2 Such a classification is supported by the following typological observations: the triangular-to-lyre-shaped head of the Akrotiri figurine can be compared to that of a figure of Thimme's 'middle Spedos variety'203 as well as to the heads of two figurines in the Goulandris collection.204 The trapezoidal upper torso with projecting upper arms is sometimes seen on Thimme's 'middle Spedos variety',2o5 but the projecting upper arms which are thin and schematically rendered are particularly characteristic of the 'late Spedos variety'.206 The gently curving outline of the hips and legs is seen on a figurine of the 'middle Spedos variety' from Amorgos207 and on another in the Goulandris collection.2o8 The slightly broken profile axis and the slight bend of the legs at the knees is characteristic of the 'late Spedos variety'.209 The arching forearms can sometimes be seen on the figurines of the 'late Spedos variety',20o but constitute a usual feature of the '99 An ivory folded-arm figurine and three marble heads from Tholos C at Archanes [I.

These affinities form a long list: the representation of a female figure in an apparently pregnant state, the head with the broad curving top, the long aquiline nose, the neckline which is curving in front and V-shaped on the rear, the narrow arms, the rendering of the left forearm shorter than usual because of the great width of the upper torso, the subtly arching forearms to accent the swelling of the belly, the rather large pubic triangle, which is bisected at its apex by the continuation of the leg-cleft, the making of the upper arms much wider on the back than in front and their separation from the torso by means of wedge-shaped grooves. Chalandriani variety Named after the site of an extensive cemetery on Syros, the Chalandriani variety constitutes typologically the latest of the five varieties of the Cycladic canonical idols with folded arms and is, thus, dated towards the end of the EC II period and to the transitional EC II-III phase.215 37. 679216 (FIG. 14, PLATE 26 a-d).

Female figure. A horizontal incision at hip-level and the incised inguinal lines form a broad pubic triangle. It is not clear whether the small part preserved above the pubic area belongs to the belly or to the lower folded forearm. A slight projection at the back indicates the buttocks. The legs are markedly short, held together, tapering toward the feet and separated by a superficial incision. The right leg appears wider than the left. Their curving outline in profile indicates that they are slightly bent at the knees. The feet are markedly inclined. Towards the end of EC II. Renfrew and Getz-Preziosi included in this variety the typologically related figurines with an anomalous arm arrangement (e.g. with left arm below right, with left arm raised and sometimes running diagonally along the thorax, with both arms upraised and set diagonally on the thorax), considering them as the final sculptural products of the EC period, which thus present a dissolution of the canon and a relaxation of the rules."27 Thimme, on the contrary, considered the anomalous arm-position as a deviation from the canonical form and as a basic feature of a special 'postcanonical group' which he dated to the EC III period, although he accepted that certain of these figurines may overlap in date with the canonical late Chalandriani variety idols.28 The examples of the variety here referred to belong to the form with the canonical right-below-left arm- position. 211 Ibid. 480-3, nos. 216, 221-2; see also D-G 1978, 131, no. 147; D-G 1983, 146, no. 178. 21 Sculptors, 49. 213 See the male Plastiras figurine 6858 above. 214 Sculptors, II5-7, pls 40-I. 2'5 On the Chalandriani variety see: Figurines, 17-18, IV.

Others are reported or reputed to have come from Naxos,221 Paros,22 Keros,'3 Ios,224 and Thera,25 and others are of unknown provenance.226 The Chalandriani variety figurines with the canonical arm-position currently number thirty-eight examples (the Akrotiri figurine 6792 included). According to Thimme's classification of the idols of this variety,227 the Akrotiri figurine seems to belong to about the middle of the Chalandriani series, as it still has an outline tapering toward the feet, whereas in the latest examples of the variety the legs give a square effect, just as the upper body. TECHNIQUE AND MANUFACTURE On the basis of the observations made on the EC figurines from Akrotiri on Thera, certain specific questions related to the EC idols need to be considered: the occurrence of figurines which have been made of materials other than marble, the traces of ancient mending and the possible paint ghosts preserved on some of them, the system of proportions employed for their manufacture, the possibility of identifying the hands of individual sculptors and their origin. FIGURINES OF MATERIALS OTHER THAN MARBLE Seven out of the total of thirty-seven EBA figurines from Akrotiri are of a material other than marble (TABLE 2): five are of white or whitish tuff(I762, 624o, x885, I860, I886), one is of white limestone (i928), and one is a natural sea-pebble (3o072). All of them are schematic: four have been classed in the pebble form (1762, 624o, 1928, 3o72), one is of the spade type (1885), and two are of forms which cannot be classed in any of the known types of schematic figurines (I86o, 1886). Thera, along with Melos and Keros, is one of the few Cyclades that lack good white marble. For this reason, the marble figures and vases said to have been found on Thera, in particular 2'9 (I) Kykladika II, Is4; Zervos, fig. 245; Figurines, 17, IV.

These are the two male figures of the Plastiras type 6820 (FIG. 9, PLATE 14 a-d) and 6858 (FIG. IO, PLATE I6 a-d) and the two precanonical idols 68x5 (FIG. 12, PLATE 21 a-d) and 682x (FIG. 13, PLATE 23 a-d). In one case a repair hole is found just below the base of the neck (6858), in another at the lower part of the left calf (682I), in two other cases a pair of holes is found one at each thigh (6858) or one at each knee (6815) and in another case there is an unfinished hole at the right thigh (6820).

Thus, a high proportion of the Plastiras figures broke already in antiquity, either in the course of making or transporting or during later use.243 This fact led Thimme and Getz-Preziosi to suggest that it was probably the fragility of the EC I idol-types that led around the end of this period to the modification of the form, particularly in the vulnerable areas of the head/neck juncture, the legs, and the feet, which resulted in the formation of the canonical idol-type.244 It is not surprising, then, that the two Plastiras figurines and the two more or less Plastiras- like precanonical idols from Akrotiri on Thera suffered serious damage in antiquity exactly at the points recognized as most vulnerable.

In two cases (6820, 6858--below base of neck) the holes have been pierced through the main surface of the figures (front or back view) and in three (6858--thighs, 6815, 6821x) sideways, that is from the sides of the legs. On the left knee of 68I5 the perforation is conical and has been made from the outer side of the leg;246 in the other cases the holes have been bored from both directions, thus giving their passages a distinctly hourglass shape.247 The unfinished perforation at the lower edge of the right thigh of 682o has been bored from back to front. Similar 'false starts' are mentioned in three other cases: (I) slightly above the repair hole at the back of the right calf of a Louros-type figurine found in the name-grave 26,248 (2) on the left buttock of a male Plastiras figure of unknown provenance,249 above the break at the left thigh, and (3) just above the break at the base of the neck of an unpublished Spedos- variety figurine from Keros.250 According to Getz-Preziosi,25' the conical or hourglass-shaped repair hole, made with a tapered, roughly pointed, hand-rotated borer is seen only rarely after the transitional EC I-II phase. In the EC II period this hand-rotated awl seems to have been largely replaced by a tubular drill that could produce smaller, more cylindrical holes. PAINT GHOSTS Possible paint ghosts were noticed in two cases on the Akrotiri figurines: on 6818, of the Plastiras type, and on the precanonical 682I, which is in every respect a Plastiras-type figurine, except for the position of the forearms. On the former, the paint has been used to indicate either the hair or some kind of hairdress, on the latter, to indicate the hair. In the case of 6818, the possible paint ghost has the form of two small knob-like protuberances at the back top of the head (FIG. 8, PLATE 13 b, d); in the case of 682I, the ghost of the once-painted hair has the form of a truncated triangular part at the back of the head, which is bordered by two slightly raised slanting lines converging on the nape (FIG. 13, PLATE 23 b). This is evidently the most commonly used method to treat the hair.25' According to Getz-Preziosi's remarks, the consistent or frequent use of paint to indicate specific details is not evidenced before the emergence of the first true folded-arm figures at the beginning of EC II, though the occasional use of paint is not unknown earlier: a dab of red paint on the face or torso and red stripes on the cheeks and neck have been noticed on two or three Plastiras-type figures, while on a harpist of the precanonical type there is the ghost of a painted cap.253 Colour has also been found in the interior of EC I vessels.254 However, the use of paint for such details as hair or hairdress had not been recognized until now on EC I figures.255 245 Getz-Preziosi (n. 97), 8. 246 Cf. ibid. 8 and figs. 4-6. 247 Cf. ibid. 8-1o; figs. 7-II, 21-2. 248 Papathanasopoulos 1961/62 (n. 14), I35, pl. 70 f; Getz- Preziosi (n. 97), 15 n. 17. 249 Thimme, in Art and Culture, 441, no. 77; Getz-Preziosi (n. 97), 15 n. 17; 29, no. 8; fig. 18. 250 Ibid. 30, n. 25' Sculptors, 25. 252 Getz-Preziosi and Weinberg (n.

According to her observations, the system of proportions employed in the Plastiras idols involved the division of the figure into three parts, the dividing lines occurring at the shoulders and at the hips; the mid-point is at about the bottom of the forearms, while at a point near the waist the figure usually has a width equal to one sixth of its height.256 These observations, accepted by other scholars too,257 seem to be valid in the cases of the nearly complete Plastiras-type figurines 68i8 (FIG. 8, PLATE 13 a-d) and 683o (FIG. II, PLATE 17 a-d) from Akrotiri on Thera, as well as in the more fragmentary ones 6858 (FIG. Io, PLATE 16 a-d) and 682o+6859 (FIG. 9, PLATES 14 a-d, 15 a-d). On the basis of this tripartite design, the total height of 683o must have been about 18 cm (which is verified if the head 6829, presumably belonging together with 683o, is counted in), while the total heights of 6858 and 682o+6859 must have been about 30 cm and 24 cm respectively. Getz-Preziosi has further suggested the use of a four-part scheme in the canonical folded- arm figures, in particular those of the Kapsala and Spedos varieties, the dividing lines occurring at the base of the neck, at a mid-point in the abdomen and at the knees. The maximum width (occurring at the shoulders or upper arms) or the head-neck unit are often equivalent to one-quarter of the total length/height.258 Renfrew feels hesitant to accept the validity of this quadripartite plan for the majority of the canonical folded-arm figurines. In his view, many pieces may have been designed, without any specific canon of proportions, while, on the other hand, a significant number of them may have been carved on the basis of several different systems.259 Examining a number of Spedos variety figures in the Goulandris collection, he observed the employment sometimes of a four- and sometimes of a five-part scheme; according to these the head is equivalent to one-fourth or one-fifth of the total height of the figure as well as to the maximum width, occurring at the shoulders. He has further noticed that in the late phase of the 'Keros-Syros culture' (EC II), that is in the figurines of the Dokathismata and Chalandriani varieties, the system of six parts is employed, in which the head equals one sixth of the total height. In the case of the Kapsala variety figurine 68i6 (FIG. 14, PLATE 24 a-d) from Akrotiri, neither Getz-Preziosi's nor Renfrew's quadripartite or quinquepartite plan seems to have been employed. In this figurine the head-neck unit is equivalent to the part from the shoulders to the bottom of the right forearm and the two of them to the part from the latter point to the knees. The mid-point seems to be at the pubic area and the total height to have been about 20 cm. On the other hand, in the case of the Spedos variety figurine 2684 (PLATE 25 a-d) both Getz-Preziosi's quadripartite plan and Renfrew's system of six parts seem to be partially valid, since the head-neck unit is about one-fourth of the total height of the figure, while the head alone is about one sixth of this. The tripartite design used for the carving of the Plastiras figures also seems to have been employed in the precanonical figurine 68i5 (FIG. 12, PLATES 21 a-d, 22 a-d) from Akrotiri, which keeps only some of the features of the Plastiras type, whereas in the completely 256 Getz-Preziosi (n. 148), 48; ead., in Art and Culture, 72; Sculptors, 37. 257 Thimme, in Art and Culture, 436; R.

The latter case is in accordance with Thimme's and Getz- Preziosi's observations that in the late stage of development of the Plastiras figures the four- part scheme was adopted.26o The total heights of the two Akrotiri figurines must thus have been about 28-9 cm for the former and 26 cm for the latter. IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL SCULPTORS AND THEIR ORIGIN Tsountas was the first Cycladic scholar to recognize the hands of individual sculptors in the two figures of the Dokathismata variety found in the name-grave 14 on Amorgos, in the two large series of schematic figurines found in T 103 at Pyrgos on Paros and T 117 at Krassades on Antiparos as well as in the two schematic idols found in T 127 at Livadi on Despotikon.26' Getz-Preziosi, going further than this, has isolated the hands of individual sculptors not only in the various types of schematic and naturalistic figurines found together in graves but also in the many others which have not been found together, whether these have come from systematic excavations or are scattered in the various museums and private collections all around the world.262 Her criteria for doing this are the recurring complex of characteristics that define a sculptor's style, such as the outline contours, the treatment of specific forms and the manner in which certain details are executed. With the exception of the Spedos variety figurine 2684 (PLATE 25 a-d), which exhibits many similarities to the idols that Getz-Preziosi has attributed to the 'Schuster master',263 the Akrotiri figurines seem to stand quite apart from the other known examples of Cycladic idols: they show no particular similarities to other figurines which belong to the same types nor can they be attributed to any of the individual sculptors which Getz-Preziosi has identified. They seem, then, to be the products of the work of sculptors not yet identified elsewhere. Taking into consideration Getz-Preziosi's observations together with the careful examination of the Akrotiri figurines, one thing seems to be certain: that the two males and the one female Plastiras-type idols 68x8 (FIG. 8, PLATE 13 a-d), 682o+6859 (FIG. 9, PLATES 14 a-d, 15 a-d) and 6829+6830 (FIG. II, PLATES 17 a-d, 18 a-d) as well as the Plastiras-like precanonical 6821 (FIG. 13, PLATE 23 a-d) were carved by the same sculptor, whereas the male Plastiras figure 6858 (FIG. IO, PLATE 16 a-d) is the work of another. The former four figurines, irrespective of the fact that they belong to both sexes, are similar in every respect. Their similarities are the rectangular upper torso, the sloping shoulders, the placing of the breasts rather high on the chest, the marked separation of the arms from the torso by means of cut- outs, the indication of the inguinal lines both sculpturally and by means of slanting incisions or grooves, the outline contours of the hips, buttocks, and calves both when viewed from the front or rear and in profile, the continuation of the groove indicating the spine downwards to divide the buttocks and the upper part of the thighs, and the rendering of the penis on the males. The figurine 6858, on the other hand, has a number of conspicuous differences from them, such as the horizontal shoulders, the holding of the upper arms close to the sides of the torso, the elongated and slightly swollen belly, the horizontal incision at hip-level, the 260 Thimme, in Art and Culture, 436, 439, no. 72; Sculptors, 38 and fig. 15 b. 26' Kykladika I, 194, 195. 262 Sculptors, 57-I41. 263 See figurine 2684 above.</page><page sequence="43">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA 49 indication of the navel, the less emphasized penis, the shoulder blades, the buttock fold, the outline contour of the buttocks in profile view, the slightly bent thighs. Whether the sculptors were Therans or not we cannot say. As already said above, since Thera lacks good white marble, it is usually considered probable that it also lacked marble workshops and that the marble objects said to have been found on the island were imported from other islands to the north or at least were made of marble brought in from elsewhere.264 However, a number of peculiarities shown by the Akrotiri figurines indicate that these have a distinctly local character, which means either that there were Theran sculptors working with imported raw marble or that we have to do with some inventive and innovative non-Theran artists who have not yet been identified elsewhere, or even that we have a combination of these two possibilities. These peculiarities are: the use of a locally available material, namely of whitish tuff, for the carving of schematic figurines (TABLE 2), the existence of types of schematic figurines which are presently unique in the Cyclades or the Aegean (1928, 3072, 6806, I860, x886), the unique case of the transformation of a rim fragment of a bowl into a schematic figurine of the Apeiranthos type (6817), the occurrence on both the schematic and naturalistic figurines of features which are rarely seen or are quite unknown in the Cyclades (the triangular prong of the shouldered form, the thickness of the Troy type, the arm-position of the precanonical figures), the singularity of the Plastiras figures compared with the other known examples of the type. In any case, those who carved the small schematic figurines out of whitish tuff must have been certainly Therans. EXCAVATION DATA CONDITIONS OF FINDING (see FIG. 15 and TABLE 4) Studying the conditions of finding of the EC figurines from Akrotiri on Thera, one can make the following remarks: Nineteen out of the total of thirty-seven figurines, all of them small, schematic depictions of the human figure, with the exception of the canonical folded-arm idol of the Spedos variety 2684, came from the layer of the volcanic destruction of the city; these were found either in rooms of the houses (both in the upper and ground floors) or in the roads and squares around the buildings, where their upper floors fell in ruins due to the repeated earthquakes of the final catastrophe. Seventeen others--seven schematic and ten fragmentary naturalistic ones--came from the layer of the seismic destruction of the city, which seems to have occurred at a very early stage of the LC I period. This layer was found in the form of debris containing collapsed building material, fragments of stone vessels and plaster, fragmentary bones, shells and obsidian blades, and a large number of highly fragmented sherds, which in the course of the rebuilding operation ensuing the earthquake was spread and tightly packed together over the open areas of the settlement (roads and squares) or the ground floors of the houses, thus forming a new raised level. The area around pillar pit 17 in Cenotaph Square, the area E of room D9.I and the pillar pit 12 on Telchines Road, where the seventeen EC figurines were found, are points 264 See n. 229.</page><page sequence="44">50 PANAYI OTA SOTIRAKOPOULOU ANA~KA~H AKPRTHPIOY BHPA~ TOMEAt A 13 rEVLXQ Torcoyparplxo Al ~Up~v~ 8 x, 20m h B 24 ~ V b OIKIA 8 TYNAIKPN 30 f ~I I IA~L~ :i ,z "~a~ a- ji n~orclcr Krvo+~lou hYTIKH a OIKIA -o "' " :,;"-Q: " *Nb;l~~ us B ? 4 u3( 55 -;r t~t 144 d~ dj F IE~TH 5 Lo bn4~ nXarEla dr ~I r bg I r~lrur~u )aoi 81 a dro -i n~ bra ITOMEA~ d c AN6HPO 2 Oli&lt;lA c 644 bR ATKYPA~ PIN6HPO I I 0a ,I -iP ,^~-=-~ ITS ~ 36 144 ~ ~20 // i I__~ dla II dll dd J 42~L'L' da E~TH 2 au ; ~ p_ a's :1 . ~,h '" zrr~lZ~bT: ~r" Tg i 88 TK) alis ,, os r7 TOMEAT 87 u c- r~a r Y 81 o TOMEAT B tr a8 39a 40 L KTIPIO rl KAhQN ATTEIQN f E~TH 3' 1 re I na s a;~ii, ) ; ?' : 12 J 1, ~f: : : 1,~ I 14 11 1, rr It _~ _E~TH 4 Icr I 41 44 1 ~:~ It OIKIA NOT IO BPANlaF(( nlarLI~ BP~Y'WY KTI~MA Elr000~ FIG. 15 Distribution of the EC figurines in the LC settlement of Akrotiri on Thera.</page><page sequence="45">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA i5 TABLE 4.

The seven schematic figurines were found scattered in the seismic destruction layer at all three points mentioned above. The ten fragmentary naturalistic ones, comprising the six Plastiras-type figures, the two precanonical idols, and the two figurines of the Kapsala and Chalandriani varieties, were all found in a roughly made quadrilateral structure which was revealed within this layer just SE of pillar pit 17 (FIG. 16). This structure was found to contain a hoard of EC objects and will be discussed in a separate section below. Only one figurine was found in a purely EC context; this is the schematic figurine of the Troy type 547, which came from the rock-cut vaulted structure of pillar pit 6.268 The finding of EC material in the destruction levels of the last phases of occupation is not surprising in the case of Akrotiri. It has been shown in recent years that the majority of the LN and EC pottery from the site comes from the layer of the final catastrophe of the city, a considerable amount was contained in the layer of the seismic destruction of the early LC I period, and only a small amount was found in the two sealed EC contexts of the 'sacrificial fire' and the rock-cut vaulted structure of pillar pit 6.269 The explanation proposed for this is the long span of life of the settlement, from the LN till the end of the LC I period, and the intense building activity observed during its last two, at least, phases of occupation; this had as a result the dislodging of objects of older times from deeper layers, the levelling of the remains of earlier structures with the purpose of erecting new buildings on them and the reuse of the earlier building material for the construction of new houses. This building material contained in fragmentary condition all kind of evidence of the earlier history of the settlement, such as pottery, stone tools and vessels, bones, shells, obsidian blades, and cores, as well as the twenty- five schematic EC idols mentioned above. Perhaps it is not accidental that all the figurines found scattered in the debris layers of the volcanic or the earlier seismic destruction of Akrotiri were schematic and only those contained in the structure of the Cenotaph Square and the one found just under the supposed roof of compartments B5-B5a (2684) were of naturalistic types; this means that the former had most probably been used as building material, whereas the latter must have had some special meaning. Just as in the case of Akrotiri, where all the EC figurines, with the exception of that from the rock-cut vaulted structure of pillar pit 6, were found in levels either of a very early or of the mature phase of the LC I period, the EC idols from Ayia Irini on Kea270 and Phylakopi on Melos27' were, with few exceptions, found in layers ranging in date from the MBA to LH III C. 265 Thera, iv. 9; Thera, v. 44-5; S.

These seventeen figurines from Cenotaph Square, taken together with the three coming from the area of room D3, the two others found in the Triangle Square and the one from pillar pit 33, raise the number of the figurines found in the area between the West House and Xeste 5 to twenty-three, that is over three-fifths of the total, amounting to 62.16%. Four others came from the area of Xeste 3 and three from Monkeys' Square; the rest are isolated finds scattered at several other points of the settlement (D9.I and E of it, outside the south wall of DI5, BI, pillar pits 6 and I2, Xeste 4-room 3). Unlike the earliest Akrotiri pottery, which tends to concentrate south- and southwestward and shows the densest concentration at Xeste 3 and the areas just to the north and south of it,276 the EC figurines tend to concentrate toward a more northerly direction, namely in the area defined by the West House to the west and Xeste 5 to the east and, in particular, in Cenotaph Square, where the presence of the earliest pottery, though quite well evidenced, is strikingly smaller in amount than that seen in the south and south-western part of the site. Their presence at the area of Xeste 3, where the early pottery is at its densest, is comparatively meagre (four figurines, amounting to io.81%) and remains mediocre even when we extend as far as the south end of Sector D to the north and pillar pit 6 to the east (eleven figurines, amounting to 29.72%), where the earliest pottery is still very dense. STATE OF PRESERVATION The ten naturalistic figurines found in the quadrilateral structure south-east of pillar pit 17 are all, with the exception of one (6818), fragmentary (TABLE 5.A).

The remaining twenty-seven figurines which came from other parts of the site are all schematic, with the exception of a complete and almost intact folded-arm idol of the Spedos variety (2684). Twelve of these schematic ones are missing the whole or the upper part of the prong, the whole or the edge of one arm-stump, the upper or lower part of the body, or small parts at the edges of the body (TABLE 5.B). The rest are either intact or chipped at the edges or along the outline. The finding of idol-fragments or figurines broken in pieces, as a rule of naturalistic but in certain cases of schematic types too, is not unusual in the EBA Aegean and is seen in the Cyclades, in Crete, and on the Greek mainland. The idol-fragments may be either schematic figurines missing the prong indicating the head and neck or naturalistic figures missing the head, neck, legs, or feet or consisting of isolated heads and legs only. In most cases they have</page><page sequence="49">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA 55 been used as grave-offerings, in other cases they have been found scattered near graves, but there are also cases in which they have been found in possible sanctuary areas or in settlements. All these are considered to constitute peculiarities of usage of the EC figurines. A hybrid schematic figurine which had been deposited headless in the grave is reported to have come from T Iog at Pyrgos on Paros.277 Naturalistic figurines of the Plastiras, precanonical and folded-arm types missing the head, the neck, the legs, or the feet are known to have come from several graves in Naxos,278 from T 14 at Dokathismata on Amorgos279 and T 2 at Manika in Euboia,28o as well as from graves at Koumasa'8' and Platanos,l8a from the Agios Onouphrios deposit,283 from the Platyvola cave,284 and from Tekes285 in Crete. Such fragmentary idols are sometimes found in the graves together with isolated heads or legs of other figures. Grave IV at Aplomata on Naxos included an example of the Kapsala variety missing the legs below the knees as well as three broken pieces (head, calves, feet) of what was apparently a single figure.?86 The seven figurines found in the Agios Kosmas cemetery are, with the exception of the two schematic ones, fragments missing the head, neck, and feet or isolated heads with necks;287 even the one of the two schematic figurines, which are complete, was found broken in two pieces placed side by side. I. Sakellarakis reports torsos of folded-arm idols missing the head and legs as well as isolated heads and legs from Tholos C and the area of the rocks to the WSW of it at Archanes.288 Idol-legs alone are reported to have been found in many graves on Antiparos,'89 while isolated heads are known to have come from T 112 at Krassades, also on Antiparos,290 from Aplomata on Naxos29' and from the Agios Onouphrios deposit in Crete.292 Naturalistic figurines of the Plastiras and folded-arm types are also reported to have sometimes been found in graves broken in pieces (at the neck, the legs, the knees, or the ankles). An example of this is the very large folded-arm figure from Amorgos, now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens (NM 3978).293 Tsountas reports a Kapsala-variety idol from T 5 at Kapsala on Amorgos, which was broken in three when deposited in the grave,294 as well as another Kapsala-variety figure from T 13 at Dokathismata on Amorgos295 and a schematic idol of the spade-type from T 115 at Krassades on Antiparos296 whose heads were found detached from their bodies.

The deposition of broken or incomplete marble objects (figurine fragments, stone vases without their lids, or even lids alone) in the Cycladic tombs or their scattering near graves is considered by some scholars as some sort of funerary ritual involving the intentional breaking of objects and even the deliberate discarding of parts of them.308 Thimme, in addition to this, being convinced that the canonical Cycladic figurines represent a female divinity, explains the frequent presence of fragments in the graves by the assumption that a religious significance was attached even to the figurines which were in a broken state.309 Renfrew, though at first unwilling to accept the existence of a general and deliberate policy of breakage at the time of burial and stating that the breakages documented may be suggestive of damage during use in daily life,3I0 finally accepts the deliberate breakage of objects with symbolic significance in the course of certain rituals and the explanation that this hypothesis offers not only for the fragments found in the cemeteries, inside and outside the graves, but also for those found in the settlements.3" Similar rituals involving the intentional breaking of figurines at the time of burial appear to have been practised during the EBA in Asia Minor too. Mellink reports that the few marble figurines of the Kusura and Troy types found in the graves near the EBA settlement at Karataa-Semayiik either headless or with heads which had been knocked off had apparently been deliberately broken before they were buried.3I2 Hockmann suggests that the intentional breaking of a figure's feet, as well as weighing it 297 Papathanasopoulos 1961/62 (n. 14), 115, 123-4, pls 46 3, 54 /. 298 Kykladika I, 155, pl.

L. Davis, finally, suggests the testing of alternative hypotheses:3'5 in the case of the presence of fragmentary figures in graves that it might be due to their recycling from earlier burials or to their sharing among graves, perhaps as an economy measure; but, even so, he still finds it difficult to think of an alternative non-funereal explanation for them; in the case of the presence of fragmentary figurines in settlements, he suggests that either they were brought back to the settlement and kept intentionally there after the deliberate breaking and discarding of parts of them during burial or that they were parts of a manufacturer's or distributor's store and were caught in catastrophic destructions. He further notes that if the figurine fragments formed part of a manufacturer's store 'we might expect to find evidence of debitage from the manufacture of figures'; but none of this is known as yet from Ayia Irini and Phylakopi nor-I add--from Akrotiri on Thera. Moreover, in both this and the case that they were part of a distributor's store 'we might expect not only to find evidence that it was complete figures which met with destruction, but also the distribution of figures should be clumped with the epicentre of the distribution in a single or otherwise in a restricted part of the site'. At Akrotiri, as a matter of fact, such a clumped distribution of naturalistic figurines is seen in the structure revealed south-east of pillar pit 17, but the evidence in this specific case seems to be in favour of a quite different interpretation. INTERPRETATION Some scholars claim that the finds ofEC figurines made in settlements, notably Phylakopi on Melos and Ayia Irini on Kea,3'6 and the evidence of breakage and subsequent repair in antiquity shown by some of them indicate that they were not made uniquely for the graves but were also used by the living for some ritual or religious purpose prior to their interment with the dead.317 In this respect, the figurine fragments found in settlements may be the debris of 'shrines', which may have been large or small, public or private, and accompanied their owners in the graves.3'8 Renfrew believes that, besides the marble figurines, the marble kandiles too were used in the course of daily life, either as ritual objects with symbolic significance or as high quality vessels intended for trade and storage, on the ground that many kandiles in the graves have breakages of the pierced lugs.3'9 Other scholars, however, are definite in stating that the primary function of the marble idols, either those of the folded-arm type alone32O or all types of them as well as of the marble 313 Id. ibid. 46-8, 51 n. 18. 314 Mylonas (n. 91), 141-2. 35 Davis, in Cycladica, 19. 316 See n. 270o-1. 37 Xanthoudides (n. 105), 24; D-G 1968, 92, n. 109; D-G 1978, 20; Burial Habits, 62-3; Caskey 1971 (n. 16), 125; Emergence, 424; Renfrew, in Art and Culture, 70; id. in Cycladica, 26-9; Cycladic Spirit, 98-9, 101, 102; Barber, in Cycladica, i1, 13-14; id.

According to both H6ckmann and Thimme, the abstract schematic idols, such as the pebble and simple violin figurines, probably originally served as amulets (Art and Culture, 44, 427). Hockmann also thinks that the Plastiras and Louros figures, which are represented in an erect posture and can stand on their own, and in particular the large forward- facing Plastiras figures, seem especially well suited for display, as in domestic shrines (Art and Culture, 44-5).</page><page sequence="52">158 PANAYIOTA SOTIRAKOPOULOU vessels,32' was to serve as grave goods. Among them Getz-Preziosi explains the damage to the marble figures and vessels as having been caused either in the sculptor's workshop or in their owner's house, a theory which, in her opinion, helps to account for the instances in which Cycladic figurines have been recovered in habitation contexts of the EC II period or earlier.32" She even wonders whether the quite numerous fragments found in LBA contexts at Ayia Irini are in fact kick-ups from earlier levels323 or whether they could have been found in a disturbed cemetery and brought into the settlement perhaps because they were considered as magically charged.324 As regards the hypothesis that the damage to the marble figurines might have been caused in the sculptor's workshop, we may refer to Davis' point, cited above,325 that in this case we need to find evidence of debitage from the manufacture of figures, none of which is as yet known from the Cycladic settlements which yielded EC marble idols. As to Getz-Preziosi's hypothesis regarding the idol-fragments from Ayia Irini, one might refer to three figurine fragments from that site, one of the folded-arm type and two schematic ones,326 and to a torso of a canonical folded-arm figurine found in the fill of the Roman cistern at Minoa on Amorgos,327 which bear traces of use as tools after they were broken. These cases constitute evidence that, in certain cases at least, the figurine fragments picked up in later times were used for practical purposes of everyday life and not at all treated as ritual objects with some religious significance. In the case of Akrotiri, in particular, the find of the complete folded-arm figurine 2684 in the volcanic destruction layer, just under the supposed roof of compartments B5-B5a,328 intrigues us to wonder whether the EC figures were used for cult purposes or for some other purpose within the settlement during the LC I period. Hockmann considers this possibility unlikely and thinks that it would be the approximately flask-shaped figurines of unbaked clay, like the one found at the bottom of the jar of the lilies in Sector A,329 that were so used.330 Davis, however, reports at least one case in which EC figurines may have continued to serve in a ritual context in later periods, namely the case of House A at Ayia Irini, where a marble EC idol was found together with other cult objects of Period V.33~' Likewise, Warren wonders whether the folded-arm figurines of the Koumasa variety presumably found built in the walls of a later house at Vassiliki332 and of Tholos C at Archanes333 in Crete had been deliberately deposited there as symbolic figures intending to ensure the success and prosperity of the building of which they formed part of the construction.334 On the other hand, the tendency of the Akrotiri figurines to concentrate in the area of Cenotaph Square, and, in particular, the fact that ten more or less fragmentary idols, all of naturalistic types, were found deposited in the quadrilateral structure revealed south-east of pillar pit 17 together with other objects of EC date, lend support to the hypothesis that these objects had been collected from some place in the vicinity. But the structure in Cenotaph Square, its contents, and its possible meaning will be discussed in detail below. 321 Mylonas (n. 91), 142; Getz-Preziosi (n. 148), 50 n. 17; ead.

The first chamber was found to contain a filling of fine clay earth suitable for the making of pottery; the second chamber has not yet been investigated. Over the first rock-cut chamber and immediately to the south-east of it was revealed the roughly made quadrilateral structure in question (FIG. 16). This lay within the seismic destruction layer of the early LC I period which covered this area and at the uppermost part of it, and its top was slightly projecting over the surface of this debris layer (PLATE 27 a). The north and east sides of the structure consist mainly of three large slabs placed in a more or less vertical position, whereas the two others have been made of slab-like and big or smaller unworked stones. Its internal dimensions are 1.30 x I m and its long axis from north to south. The structure contained a hard, tightly packed filling consisting of earth mixed with big and smaller unworked stones, small pieces of schist slabs and whitish tuff, sea pebbles of various sizes, whole or fragmentary stone tools, among them three hammers, fragments of obsidian blades and flakes, many fragmentary bones, a small clay loom-weight, a few fragments of plaster, and a great number of pottery sherds, most of them LC, less MC and even less EC in date. Right at the surface of the debris filling the structure and about the middle of it there were a complete marble kandila (PLATE 27 a) and below this some fragments of another, while the body of a third was found upside-down at the south-east corner of the structure, tightly wedged among black and red volcanic stones (FIG. 16, PLATES 28 a-b, 29 a-b). Another fragment of marble kandila was lying on top of the retaining wall south-east of the structure, while five other pieces of the fragmentary kandila revealed below the first, complete one were found within the debris layer covering the area to the east of the structure, scattered at various depths (at a distance of 2.17-2.30 m from the east side of the structure and at the depths of 0.20--I.10 m from the surface of the debris layer). At the north-east part of the structure, almost touching its northern side and at a depth of about 25 cm from the surface of its filling, were found gathered together the fragments of nine EC marble idols of naturalistic types (the six figurines of the Plastiras type, the two precanonical idols, and the canonical folded-arm figure of the Kapsala variety), all of them heavily weathered because of the modern torrent flowing until quite recently in the immediate vicinity (PLATES 28 b, 29 a-b). The figurines had been deposited in three successive layers of overall thickness of about 15 cm and took up a space measuring 29 cm NW-SE by 23 cm NE-SW. All of them were found in a horizontal position in the SE-NW axis and had the heads facing south-east. The male Plastiras figurine 68x8 was the first to be discovered lying prone on top of the cluster (PLATE 30 a), at a depth of about 25 cm from the surface of the debris filling the structure and at about the same level as the marble kandila found at its south-east corner; vertically to its intact left leg lay the lower right leg of the Plastiras type 68x9. At a slightly lower level than these and on either side of 68x8 lay the male Plastiras figurine 682o and the 335 Ergon 1984, 82; Ergon 1985, 64-5; Ergon 1992, 78-80; Doumas 1984 (n. 265), 346-7; id. 1985 (n. 265), 173; id. 1992 (n. 9), I81-4.</page><page sequence="54">IP.SOTIRAKOPO LOU SFIGURE LG fEPIOXH fELLOT 7 unoatloXw a DEXION 17 A B .:AAAMOElHEN KATAEKEYH  KATO H o 1 2tl Aa P i6o PANAYIOTA SOTIRAKOPOULOU 11q KATO ~ H 0 1 2M 0 a o c.

The figurines 6820 and 6821 were found in a supine position, whereas 6815 lay on its right side and faced north-east. The upper body of 6820, up to the area of the waist, lay on a rhomboid piece of schist slab. Immediately below them were found the Plastiras figurines 6858 and 6830 and the Kapsala variety figure 6816, as well as the head 6828 and the lower left leg 6859 of the Plastiras type again, all lying on an oblong piece of schist slab (PLATE 30 b). These took up a space measuring 24 cm NW-SE by 13 cm NE-SW. The figurine 6858 was found right under 6820, 6830 below and between 6818 and 6821, and 6816 below 682x. The figures 6858 and 6830 lay on their backs, whereas 68x6 lay on its left side and faced south-west. The head 6828 was found touching the edges of the broken legs of 6816 and facing northwards, while the leg 6859 lay immediately to the north of 6828. The fragmentary figurine 6792 of the Chalandriani variety was the only one to be found separately from the cluster of the north-eastern part; this was unearthed 20 cm deeper than the lowest series of those, in the course of cleaning the central part of the structure from a filling of loose earth mixed with stones. At the same depth as the topmost of the figurines (6818) but at the south-west part of the structure was revealed a limestone slab with shallow cavities in a spiraliform arrangement on one side, lying in a horizontal position.336 Below the cluster of the figurines and occupying the central part of the northern half of the structure there were two successive schist slabs lying in a more or less horizontal position and broken in many pieces. A similar schist slab was lying just under the slab with the cavities (PLATE 29 b). At about the middle of the eastern half of the structure, starting from the same level as the lowest series of the figurines and continuing c. 35 cm deeper, was found a cluster of obsidian objects (PLATE 31 a), consisting of two cores, two whole and several fragmentary blades, and a number of flakes. At the same area, finally, and at about the same depth as the lowest of the obsidian objects was discovered an intact triangular bronze dagger, I6.5 cm long, lying in a horizontal position in the NE-SW axis, with the blade pointing northeastwards. INTERPRETATION Doumas has suggested that the rock-cut chamber of pillar pit 17 was a tomb evidently belonging to a cemetery which extended in this area during the EC period. On the basis of this assumption, he has further proposed that with the extension of the settlement in the MC period the rock-cut tomb was transformed into a repository of potter's clay, and thus its contents, perhaps together with the contents of other tombs in this area, were placed in the quadrilateral tomb-like structure made immediately to the south-east of it exactly for this reason. The structure is thus explained as a kind of cenotaph and the whole area around pillar pit 17 as a holy place devoted to revered ancestors.337 As further evidence in support of the holiness of this area even in the EC period Doumas refers to the presence of the sacrificial fire and the large stone pithos in the immediate vicinity, which had been attributed a religious significance already by Marinatos.338 336 Similar slabs are known from Naxos; see C.

It is, thus, shown to be posterior to the supposed transformation of the supposed rock-cut tomb into a repository of potter's clay and to the consequent clearing-out of its contents in the MC period. The placing of the EC objects in the structure seems, then, to have taken place later than the use of the rock-cut chamber as a repository of potter's clay and after the seismic destruction of the early LC I period; (iii) the similar rock-cut chamber of pillar pit 6, where the schematic figurine of the Troy type 547 came from, was found to contain household pottery of early EC III date, together with bones, broken obsidian blades and stone implements.340 On the basis, then, of the various views cited above, the hoard of EC finds made in the structure south-east of pillar pit 17 may imply the existence in EC times of either a workshop or a shrine or a cemetery in the vicinity. The hypothesis that the marble objects come from a workshop must be excluded for the following two reasons: first, because, despite the impression of a distinctly local character given by the Akrotiri figurines, it is not at all certain that marble workshops did exist in the island; second, because no evidence of debitage from the manufacture of marble figures and vessels is so far known from the site. On the other hand, the placing of the EC objects in a quadrilateral structure imitating an EC cist grave, as well as the slight projection of the top of it over the surface of the seismic destruction layer of the early LC I period which covered this area, seems rather to be in favour of Doumas' view that this structure was a kind of cenotaph made by the later inhabitants of Akrotiri in order to hold the contents of EC tombs belonging to a nearby cemetery than of the hypothesis that these objects are the debris of a nearby shrine. In support of this view one could also refer to the fact that the examples of all the marble objects found in the structure (kandiles, figurines of the Plastiras and precanonical types, folded-arm figurines of the Kapsala and Chalandrani varieties) which are currently known to have come from systematic excavations have in almost all cases been found in graves.34' The slabs bearing the representation of a single spiral are also considered to denote the location of a cemetery.342 339 Information given to me by the zooarchaeologist Dr K.

Another point, finally, is that not too much care seems to have been taken by the later inhabitants of Akrotiri in making the structure and placing the EC objects in it; in corroboration of this we may recall its rough construction within the debris layer of the seismic destruction as well as the fact that the fragments of one of the kandiles lying on top of it were found scattered in the debris layer at a distance of more than 2 m to the east of it and at various depths. We cannot but hope, then, that further investigation in the next excavation periods will shed more light on this intriguing and still problematic area (PLATE 31 b). CONCLUSIONS The excavation in recent years at Akrotiri on Thera, in particular in the area around pillar pit 17 in Cenotaph Square, as well as at Xeste 3 and Xeste 4, brought to light twenty-one new EC figurines, which, taken together with the other already known or completely unknown Akrotiri material, raise the number of the EC idols from the site to thirty-seven. These constitute a significant body of evidence, not only because they show unmistakably the importance of the settlement at Akrotiri from the very beginning of the third millennium BC - more than half of them (20 out of 37) date to the EC I period - but also because, including types and showing features up till now rarely seen or even completely unknown, they enrich our knowledge of the EC figurative sculpture. The Akrotiri figurines comprise a wide range of types, both schematic and naturalistic, covering almost the whole of the known EC sculptural repertoire and also introduce types which are entirely new. From the point of view of the schematic figurines, the pebble, shouldered, spade, Troy, Apeiranthos, and Phylakopi I or Ayia Irini types are represented, and new types, such as the bipartite, the hybrid Louros/schematic, and a peculiar form are introduced. The naturalistic figurines are represented by six idols of the Plastiras type, three of them males, two precanonical ones, and three canonical figures of the folded-arm type, belonging to the Kapsala, Spedos, and Chalandriani varieties respectively. Of particular interest among them are the figurines of the Plastiras type, especially the males; these show the stereotyped views regarding the difference between males and females in body structure and the relatively swollen belly as an indication of pregnancy not to be valid in all cases. Moreover, both males and females present quite unusual features: all of them are characterized by a marked separation of the upper arms from the torso, while two of the males are depicted ithyphallic. The two precanonical idols are also of particular interest, on the ground of their unusual arm-positions; these furnish important new evidence in support of the long ancestry of the EC figurative sculpture and its indigenous character. Another important aspect of the Akrotiri figurines is the fact that seven out of the total of thirty-seven idols, all of them schematic, are of local materials, such as the whitish tuff and the white limestone. This furnishes evidence in support of the view that the unusual materials used for the manufacture of figures which have not come from systematic excavations can no longer throw doubt upon their authenticity. Two of the male Plastiras figures and the two precanonical ones preserve traces of ancient mending in the form of conical or hourglass-shaped holes exactly at the points recognized as most vulnerable, while the third male figure of the Plastiras type and one precanonical</page><page sequence="58">I64 PANAYIOTA SOTIRAKOPOULOU preserve possible paint ghosts. In both cases the paint has been used to indicate either the hair or some kind of hairdress. This is an important piece of evidence, in view of the fact that the use of paint for such details had not until now been recognized on EC I figures. Regarding the system of proportions employed in the naturalistic figurines, Getz-Preziosi's tripartite design seems to be valid in all the Plastiras-type idols from Akrotiri as well as in one of the precanonical figures, whereas in the other precanonical it is her quadripartite system which seems to have been used. In the case of the Kapsala variety figurine neither her quadripartite nor Renfrew's quinquepartite plan seems to have been employed, whereas in the case of the Spedos variety figure both Getz-Preziosi's four-part and Renfrew's six-part system seem to be partially valid. With the exception of the Spedos variety figure, which shows many similarities to the idols that Getz-Preziosi has attributed to the 'Schuster master', the Akrotiri figurines show no particular similarities to the other Cycladic idols which belong to the same types, nor can they be attributed to any of the individual sculptors which Getz-Preziosi has identified. The careful examination of the material shows that the Plastiras-type figurines, with the exception of the male 6858, as well as the Plastiras-like precanonical 682x, even though they belong to both sexes, are similar in every respect and, consequently, must have been carved by the same sculptor; the male Plastiras idol 6858 seems to be the work of another. The number of peculiarities shown by the Akrotiri figurines indicate that these have a distinctly local character, which means either that there were Theran sculptors working with imported raw marble or that we have to do with some inventive and innovative non-Theran artists who have not yet been identified elsewhere or that we have a combination of these two possibilities. Regarding the conditions of finding of the Akrotiri figurines, nineteen out of the total of thirty-seven idols, all of them schematic depictions of the human figure, with the exception of the canonical folded-arm idol of the Spedos variety, came from the layer of the volcanic destruction of the city. Seventeen others--seven schematic and ten fragmentary naturalistic ones--came from the layer of the seismic destruction, which seems to have occurred at a very early stage of the LC I period. Only one schematic figurine was found in a purely EC context, in the rock-cut vaulted structure of pillar pit 6. Of particular interest is the hoard of naturalistic figurines discovered in Cenotaph Square; these were found in a roughly made quadrilateral structure revealed immediately to the south-east of pillar pit 17, together with one complete and two fragmentary marble kandiles, a limestone slab with shallow cavities in a spiraliform arrangement on one side, a cluster of obsidian objects and a triangular bronze dagger. The structure appears to have been made within and at the uppermost part of the seismic destruction layer of the early LC I period and its top was slightly projecting over the surface of the debris layer. The densest concentration of the Akrotiri figurines is seen in Cenotaph Square, from which came seventeen out of the total of thirty-seven idols (45.94%), while the figurines found in the wider area between the West House and Xeste 5 amount to twenty-three (62.16%). This is in marked contrast with the tendency of the earliest pottery of Akrotiri to concentrate south- and south-westward and be at its densest at Xeste 3 and the areas just to the north and south of it. Nine out of the eleven naturalistic figurines found at Akrotiri are fragmentary; three of them, besides being fragmentary, are also broken. Similarly, twelve out of the twenty-six schematic figurines which came from the site are also fragmentary. The idol-fragments or broken figures found in settlements are explained as coming either from a shrine or from a workshop or as having been brought back from a cemetery. In the case of Akrotiri, the conditions of finding of the complete folded-arm figurine of the Spedos variety imply the</page><page sequence="59">THE EBA STONE FIGURINES FROM AKROTIRI ON THERA 165 possible use of EC figures in the settlement during the LC I period for cult purposes or for some other purpose. As to the hoard of figurines found in the Cenotaph Square, the placing of EC objects in a quadrilateral structure imitating an EC cist grave, the slight projection of its top over the surface of the seismic destruction layer of the early LC I period which covered this area, and the fact that the examples of all the EC objects found in the structure are currently known almost exclusively from cemeteries, seem to be in favour of the view that this structure was a kind of cenotaph made by the later inhabitants of Akrotiri in order to hold the contents of EC tombs belonging to a nearby cemetery.
