LEIGHTONt "It was a great day for the human race . . . when the idea dawned that every man is a human being, an end in himself, with a claim for the development of his own personality, and that human beings had a dignity and a worth, respect for which is the firm basis of human association." MERRIAM, SYSTEMATIC POLITICS 59 (1945). "The Independence of America, considered merely as a separa- tion from England, would have been a matter of but little impor- tance, had it not been accompanied by a Revolution in the prin- ciples and practices of Governments. She made a stand, not for herself only, but for the world, and looked beyond the advantages herself could receive." PAINE, THE RIGHTS OF MAN 151 (1792) (Everyman's ed.) It is only from a perspective of centuries that the United Nations program for "human rights" can be accurately observed or rationally appraised. This program, too often thought to be at the periphery of the purposes of the United Nations, represents in fact the main core of rational objectives not only of the United Nations but of all dem- ocratic government.1 It represents the converging and integration on a global scale of many movements, movements hitherto restricted in areal diffusion but centuries-old and rooted deep in universal human nature and civilized culture.2 It is heir to all the great historic dem- ocratic movements-for constitutionalism, freedom, equality, frater- nity, humanitarianism, liberalism, enlightenment, peace, opportunity, and so on.3 It is the contemporary culmination of man's long struggle for all his basic human values: * This article has also appeared in the symposium on International Human Rights in the Summer, 1949, issue of LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS. t William K.

Throughout the Charter, however, runs the wise recognition, which pervaded all the great declarations of war aims and general consciousness of mankind, that peace and security, even in the limited sense of freedom from physical violence, cannot be obtained by arbitrary fiat and sheer balancing of power.7 A peace to endure must include the conditions of peace and a reduction of the severe frustrations that drive men to violence.8 Some deprivations and threats of external dictation men find more intolerable than war. Peace as the common man conceives it includes more than freedom from war and threats of war: it includes the freedom, without external dictation from any arbitrary power, to maintain and enhance by peace- ful, non-coercive procedures the value positions both of himself and of all others with whom he identifies.9 Hence the United Nations Charter insists upon a peace "in conformity with the principles of justice and international law," states among its major purposes the achievement of "international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental free- doms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion," 10 and both imposes a definite legal obligation upon its member states to promote this objective and establishes a machinery of its own to take further measures. The intensification within recent centuries, most notably since the industrial revolution, of the demands of the individual human being for security in the full sense indicated above, for the greater production and sharing of all values, and especially for respect, in the sense both of equality of access to all values and of symbolic recognition of this equality, is a matter of common observation.ll The basic trend in 6.

The latest authoritative reaffirmation of this conception appears in the preamble of the North Atlantic Security Pact, which reads that the "parties to this treaty" are "deter- mined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law."

All of the great post-feudal philosophies, from liberal capitalist through socialist and excluding only the total- itarian, have stressed the fundamental dignity of the individual human being and demanded its realization in practice. Stimulated by modern science and technology and by a growing uniformity in world attention and attitudes, practice has responded in recent generations with whole- sale liquidation of discriminations based on caste exclusions and in a great rise in community activities designed to provide individuals with any necessary compensating assistance required to raise them to minimum levels and to afford positive opportunities for maturing latent talents into socially valued expression. One could point to such items as the extension of suffrage and improvement in representation techniques; the creation of a free school system and the expansion of facilities for communication; protections against arbitrary restraint and the amelioration of punishment; provision of respected jobs at minimum wages and shorter hours of work; conscious community planning of resource use and development; provision of better housing and proper medical care; unemployment programs and employment and health insurance; social security; improvement of facilities for recreation; and many more. With the new stimulus of promise and threat in the development of atomic energy, it is not to be expected that common men the world around will reduce their demands. Short of world tyranny and intimidation, it can, on the contrary, be safely predicted that they will both increase and still further intensify their demands. It is a commonplace in a world threatened by new war and atomic destruction that all peoples everywhere are today interdependent for securing all their basic demands, that mankind today lives in what is in fact a world community. It is a familiar history, often recounted, how many changes-changes in population; changes in the attitudes, identifications, and expectations of people; changes in techniques of organization and institutional practices; and most important of all, changes in technology-the railroad, steamship, and airplane, the press and tele-communications, and now atomic energy-have trans- formed the world from relatively independent, discrete localities into a congeries of interacting regional communities and a single world community.13 It may, however, be conducive to clarity to mark out DOM (1948); LE FEVRE, LIBERTY AND RESTRAINT (1931); SCHUMAN, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS 540 (4th ed. 1948) ; 1 WRIGHT, A STUDY OF WAR 170 (1942). 12.

The most decisive value process in the world community is the world power process in which the nation-state is still the predominant participant. How power is structured internally in a nation-state, how the individ- ual human being is related to centrally organized coercion, affects very directly how that nation-state seeks to exercise power in the world arena, whether by violence or peaceful procedures. It has been observed that the Nazi leaders rose to power by the systematic sup- pression of civil liberties at home; 14 the violence they brought to the world arena still seers mankind. History too recent makes it clear that elites who come to power and maintain internal rule by violence are prone to regard violence as the principal instrument of international change; in complement, their intimidated masses are all too ready to turn their forcibly repressed and accumulated hatreds against their fellow men, across some arbitrary boundary line.l5 Conversely, the pectations of World Organization, 55 YALE L.

In Effects of International Tension on Liberty Under Law, 48 COL. L. REV. 555, 558 (1948), Fritz Morstein Marx generalizes: "As a political system dedicated to the cate- gorical imperatives of a secular religion, totalitarianism is essentially expansionist. It is missionary in spirit and messianic in aspirations." He develops the theme in Totalitarian Politics, 82(1) PROC. AM. PHIL. Soc. 1 (1940). 15. In a chapter on The Emotional Structure of Totalitarianism in his OUR AGE OF UNREASON (1942), Franz Alexander offers profound analysis of the relevant psycho- logical factors. He summarizes: "A peculiarly vicious circle in socio dynamics can be observed here. An authoritarian state is created which deprives its citizens of self-expression in the interests of economic competition with other nations. This injury to self-esteem requires aggressive action and war becomes an inevitable compensation. Diplomatic victories achieved by com- promise no longer suffice, for the heroic life of conquest and domination for their own sake and the myth of the superior race are incompatible with anything but martial victory. In order to make some compensation to those who have lost their normal means of self- expression, the ideology of the victorious super race was invented. This was an appeal to the destructive emotional forces in human nature, especially hate, which had been simmer- ing for years in an impoverished and over-disciplined people who had been forced to sacrifice butter for guns, individual expression for cringing subordination, self-esteem for awe, and conscience for blind obedience. This hate was generated in the barracks under</page><page sequence="6">RIGHTS OF MAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY respect for individual human dignity which even a democratic nation- state can maintain is in large measure a function of that state's position in a total world context. When expectations of violence and war are high, the requirements of self-preservation may move even the best- intentioned toward a "garrison-prison" state.16 In the age of the shattered atom and rumored bacteriological horrors, when all nation- states are so obsessed by expectations of impending violence that they must calculate every proposed measure of cooperation about wealth, enlightenment, or human rights generally in terms of possible effects on fighting power, it takes no great insight to know that no people can be secure unless all people are secure and possess all the conditions of security. Interdependences comparable to the kind outlined for the world power process could be indicated for every other world value process. Documentation could be offered both territorially, with respect to each value around the globe, and functionally, as between all values.17 A few suggestions must suffice. Thus, with respect to wealth, just as measures for economic improvement must be assayed in terms of their effects on power, so also because of the demands of people a rising standard of living everywhere is indispensable to security; and, further, because the economic cycle is now world-wide in its impact, depression in any significant area of the world makes it correspondingly difficult in all other areas to maintain high levels in the production and sharing of goods and, hence, the conditions under which liberty and human personality can flourish. Similarly, with respect to enlightenment, accurate knowledge of other peoples' attitudes, identifications, and expectations and a clear understanding of world-wide interdependences are indispensable to rational decisions about security and other values. Yet in a world increasingly divided and marked off by iron curtains, it is increasingly difficult for the free peoples of the world to acquire and spread the enlightenment necessary for rational decision. Finally, the sadistic drill of the sergeants, in the factories by the abolition of recently acquired political rights, in a demoralized middle-class which had sunk to the level of the proletariat and needed someone to look down upon as inferior. The awakened Frankenstein's mon- ster of hate must move against the rest of humanity to save the Fuhrer and his small camarilla from destruction. Hate once mobilized knows no barriers and cares little who are its victims. If an object is lacking, it may even react against the hater himself and oc- casion suicide." 16. Lasswell, supra note 11.

It is not too much, therefore, to summarize that because of man's deep, rising de- mands for consideration and because of all these interdependences, a world half-slave and half-free cannot endure.20 II It is in the context of these demands and interdependences that the United Nations program for human rights was conceived and is being implemented.

As in no like in- ternational treaty the "people," not the signatory states, of the United Nations reaffirm their "faith . . . in the dignity and worth of the human person, in equal rights of men and women. ..." 21 The Pur- poses and Principles, already referred to,22 which have general applica- tion to the organization are particularized in the obligation of the General Assembly to initiate studies and make recommendations for the purpose of "promoting international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural, educational, and health fields, and assisting in the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." 23 This undertaking is reiterated in Article 55 of Chapter IX, which concerns international economic and social cooperation. The obligation which looks to "the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations" binds both the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council 24 in clearly mandatory language 25 to promoting "universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." 26 Like the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council is also empowered to make recommendations to promote respect and "observance of" human rights,27 and to establish commissions for their promotion.28 The "basic objectives" of the trusteeship system are to "encourage respect for human rights" (and also to encourage, it should be noted, "recogni- tion of the interdependence of the peoples of the world.") 29 Not only are the various organs of the United Nations thus heavily obligated to satisfy demands for human rights, but the member states signatory 21.

The execution of this program finds partial expression in the Geno- cide Convention,30 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,31 the currently proposed International Covenant of Human Rights,32 and in various suggested measures for implementation and enforcement.33 The Genocide Convention and the Declaration of Human Rights, the one a treaty to be ratified, the other a declaration of policy and public affirmation addressed to member states, were approved by the General Assembly in December, 1948.34 The Convention seeks to eradicate the ultimate deprivation of human rights: the destruction of national, ethnical, racial, or religious groups "as such." 35 Inspired by frightful Nazi precedents, it prohibits not only the killing of members of a group on racial or other grounds but also the imposition of destruc- tive conditions of life, the prevention of births, and other measures directed toward group extermination.36 The scope of the Convention extends to public officials and rulers, as well as to private individ- uals,37 all of whom may in addition to the crime of genocide be indicted for conspiracy, attempt, and complicity in respect to genocide, and for "incitement" of the crime.38 Enforcement involves the undertaking by signatories to incorporate this newly devised international crime into domestic law,39 and to submit disputes as to interpretation, appli- 30.

It is a declaration of past achievement and future aspiration 44 and comprises the first step in the creation of an International Bill of Human Rights, a tripartite program to include ultimately conventions imposing in- ternational obligation for enforcement on both the domestic and international level. The product of compromise necessitated by wide divergence in economic resources available to fulfill its moral commit- ments 45 and in emphasis with respect to relation between citizen and state,46 the Declaration provides for three basic types of rights: civil liberties and political rights; economic and social rights; and inter- national rights. The first of these extends to personal liberties, in- cluding among others freedom and security of the person, freedom of thought, religion, assembly, etc.,47 as well as the political right to par- ticipate in government on an equal basis; 48 while the second category includes the right to social security, work, and choice of employment, and to education, leisure, and an adequate standard of living.49 The rights to nationality, freedom of transit, and political asylum comprise the third category.50 Limited as it is to moral suasion, the Declaration nevertheless occupies a powerful political position; it commands the attention of world public opinion. 40.

Such persons are accorded the right to a proceeding in the nature of a habeas corpus, notice of the charge, and a speedy termination of detention.63 There is explicit provision in the case of both civil and criminal offenses for a "fair and public trial," the right to counsel, confrontation by witnesses, compulsory attendance of witnesses, and, finally, for the right of presumed innocence.64 Signatories of this treaty-which has application to public officials and private individuals as well as to states 65-would be obligated to make these provisions part of domestic law.66 Beyond this the means of enforcement as an international meas- ure is still a subject of debate within the Commission on Human Rights.67 Whether the Covenant is intended to be self-executing 51.

On the details of implementation the Commission has reached agreement on only one-an obvious-point, namely, that states shall be permitted to initiate complaints for enforcement, whatever the form of implementation finally adopted.71 In the fifth session in May- June, 1949, the right of petition by individuals, groups, or organiza- tions was discussed but not agreed upon, the consensus being that further study of the problem of handling such petitions was needed.72 As to the requisite type of enforcement machinery, extensive sug- gestions have been made, running between the extremes of conserva- tive American-British and radical Australian proposals. The former, excluding individual petition by providing for reference to the Inter- national Court of Justice,73 envisages public protest and direct nego- 68. See Arts. 2 and 24. No definitive text for either article has been decided upon by the Commission, though Art. 2 has been provisionally adopted pending completion of Part II of the Covenant. The American proposal that Article 2 should contain language to the effect that "The provisions of this Covenant shall not themselves become effective as do- mestic law," was rejected by the Commission (see E/CN4/SR 125, 22 June 1949). As it now stands paragraph 1 of the Article 2 reads: "Each state party hereto undertakes to ensure to all individuals within its jurisdiction the rights defined in this Covenant. Where not already provided by legislative or other measures, each State undertakes, in accordance with its constitutional processes and in accordance with the provisions of this Covenant, to adopt within a reasonable time such legislative or other measures to give effect to the rights defined in this Covenant." E/1371, p. 28. 69. Art. 4. 70. Concerning Part I the Commission has decided to postpone consideration of the Preamble and Article 1 until the completion of Part II, or until, as in the case of Article 3, implementation measures are considered. Articles 2 and 4 have been provisionally adopted pending completion of Part II. Discussion of Article 17 in Part II has been post- poned until the Sixth Session of the Commission, and Article 21 until Article 17 is con- sidered. Of Part III, only Article 23 dealing with ratification and accession has been completed. Numerous texts for the remaining three Articles are included in the Report of the Commission to the Economic and Social Council. See U. N. Document E/1371, Annex I. Even the substantive terms of Part II still seem in question. See Draft Resolution, under the heading "Draft International Covenant on Human Rights," submitted by the Commission to the Council, requesting information on U.

It neither guarantees participation in government, the sine qua non of freedom, nor stipulates any aspirations about that economic well-being upon which today depends the fulfillment in fact of any human rights. III The principal attack from within the United States upon this pro- gram of the United Nations has come from certain leaders of the Amer- ican Bar Association, notably President Holman and ex-President Rix.79 Though characterized more by rambling fulmination and quib- 74.

See E/CN4/AG1/27 (May 10, 1948); also E/1371, p. 61. Other suggestions have been put forward by France: E/CN4/147, 1948; E/CN4/82/Add. 10, 1948; E/CN4/82/Add. 10/R. 1, 1949; E/1371, p. 70; by India: E/CN4/151 (amendment to Chinese-U. S.

The conclusion drawn by Russia relative to the various pro- posals is that they seek to engender systems of international pressure; to interfere with the internal affairs of States in conflict with the "whole system of international public law"; and to transform disputes between individuals into disputes between States. For these reasons all the proposals are considered unsatisfactory. See USSR Statement, E/CN4/154 (June 24, 1948) ; also in E/1371, p. 78. 76. The current U. S. view. See E/CN4/SR 111. 77. Ibid. 78.

The decision of 72 [Vol. 59: 60</page><page sequence="14">RIGHTS OF MAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY bling questioning than by direct assertion which could be controverted, this attack may be said in reasonable summary to emphasize three main points.80 The first charge is that the United Nations program for human rights is an invasion of the domestic jurisdiction of the United States and other nations that has nothing to do with the maintenance of peace or any other matter of legitimate international concern. The second is that United States' participation in this program is uncon- stitutional and beyond the scope of the treaty or other federal power, since the program deals with matters more of state and local than of international or even national concern. The final charge is that United States' participation in the program is dangerously impolitic for a variety of reasons, the most important of which is that the program embodies an awesome threat to our free-enterprise system and form of government, stemming from economic reformers, professors, and Mrs. Roosevelt.81 The "domestic jurisdiction" charge is developed in various ways. Both Mr. Holman 82 and Mr. Rix 83 invoke Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter, which reads in part: "Nothing con- tained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic juris- diction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present charter. ..." 84 To bring human rights within this reservation and exclude them from inter- national concern, Mr. Holman insists that "the whole purpose of the United Nations is to achieve peace" and that the maintenance of peace and preservation of human rights are separate problems, sug- gesting that neither of "the world wars were caused by the absence of an International Bill of Rights or primarily by subnormal or abnormal conditions in any country" and that at the time of launching these wars Germany "had the most advanced social and economic program the President and Board of Governors of the Association to promote a campaign of study of the proposals through regional meetings, study groups, and conferences-see 35 A.B.A.J. 40 (1949)-seems hardly to have evoked the enlightened discussion expected. For answer to the bar leaders see Moskowitz, Is the U. N.'s Bill of Human Rights Dangerous? A Reply to President Holman, 35 A.B.A.J. 283 (1949). 80. If it be objected that our summary makes the bar leaders' attack too forthright, our query is then: what do they mean? 81.

The omitted words are: "but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII." 1949] 73</page><page sequence="15">THE YALE LAW JOURNAL of any nation in the world." 85 He insists further that the United Nations is primarily "an organization of states," operating "on an international level with government meeting government," while a "bill of rights, on the other hand, has nothing to do directly with the relations between governments; it exists primarily to define the rela- tions between a government or state and the individual citizens thereof; basically it relates to internal affairs and not to international mat- ters." 86 In a declaration before the House of Delegates of the Bar Association Mr. Holman summarizes: "For the first time we have the proposals to take away from our people, their state and local govern- ment, and their national government as well, their control over the matters which have always been 'of domestic jurisdiction.' "7 Mr. Rix's contribution to this point is to ride hard the nineteenth century canards that "international law is the law of states and their relations to each other, with all enforcement and negotiations in the states alone" and that it is inappropriate for international law to purport to concern itself with the relations between a nation-state and its cit- izens.88 He asserts that the "reservation of domestic questions, known as Article 2 (7), is perfectly plain and concise" and that despite all the provisions in the United Nations Charter which call for "promoting, assisting, encouraging, recommending the cause of human rights," there has been no "creation of any contractual liability for recognition of human rights by any state." 89 The constitutional argument is more evasive, taking the form largely of vague questions. Thus, Mr. Rix inquires, quite irrelevantly to any question of constitutional power to secure human rights, "Is there no limit to the power of Congress acting under a treaty except that of prohibition in the Constitution," and, as if he were asking something new and unanswered, "Shall the treaty-making power be used as the basis for enactment of domestic legislation in the United States," and "What is the effect of treaty law as domestic law of the land, as supreme law under the Constitution." 90 Though he is nowhere explicit about limitations on the treaty power or other federal power over foreign affairs, Mr. Rix quotes with approval the well-known address of Chief Justice Hughes which distinguishes agreements relating to "the conduct of our international relations" from those which do not "per- tain to our external relations" but rather to matters "normally and appropriately" within "the local jurisdictions of the states," and as- sumes, without halting for reflection on the question of fact, that "the 85.

Hol- land,93 in which Justice Holmes delivered his famous and statesman- like opinion on the scope of the treaty power, is described as the case "in which Leviathan, with deep concern for the food supply of wild duck for a suffering people, blithely asserted that there is no limit in the United States to the treaty-making power and legislation enacted thereon unless it is prohibited by the Constitution." 94 Fearing the "destruction of a cherished system of our division of powers of govern- ment," 95 Mr. Rix has this to say of the potentialities of the Genocide Convention and of the proposed Covenant on Human Rights: "... there may be created, as law, a third body of treaty law in this country with no constitutional basis whatsoever, of equal dignity with the Constitution, as supreme law of the land, superseding all state con- stitutions, decisions and laws of the states covering the same subjects, and probably superior to all prior enacted laws of Congress on the subject." 96 The consequences of this "in a field which has been almost exclusive [sic] in the states, is so far-reaching . . . that the word revolutionary is not fully descriptive." 97 Mr. Holman also thinks this "dangerous." 98 The problem is considered aggravated by Supreme Court decisions dealing with centralization of federal power, by the recent restrictive covenant cases, and by the lack of uniformity in state anti-discriminatory employment legislation. With respect to restrictive covenants Mr. Holman urges, despite the Supreme Court ruling that they are not enforceable, that "the United States should not subscribe to setting aside what has been long established and recognized as a proper restriction with respect at least to limited areas of property." 99 In any event Mr. Holman, apparently hopeful, sug- gests these cases may be overruled.100 A minor constitutional theme, much emphasized, is that in international undertakings of this kind this country is peculiarly vulnerable since, in contrast with the further action required in most countries, under Article VI (2) of our Constitu- 91.

Its general tenor, repeated over and over, is that the provisions of the Declaration and proposed Covenant in so far as they are traditional are vague and unnecessary and likely to expose us to a "Pandora's box of complaints" from within and without, and in so far as they are not traditional are long steps toward "world-wide socialism," if not communism. 102 Thus, in strong isolationist vein Mr. Holman asserts that we risk "many international irritations and provocations" from "United Nations intervention in the domestic affairs of Nations." 103 If, he develops his theme, "the United Nations, through its own interpretation, is the final arbiter of what constitutes a matter of international concern then by its ipse dixit, the acts of our citizens, our courts and our public officials will be amenable to examination and condemnation and eventual control by the United Nations." 104 Worse still, "both in- dividuals and pressure groups in other countries, even in Russia, could have a Roman holiday in asking American cities and states, and even our federal Government, for extended explanations regarding the observance and protection by them of so-called human rights with respect to our own citizens." 105 "I leave to your imagination," states Mr. Rix, "as to what would happen. in the field of administration of municipal law if subversive elements should teach minorities that the field of civil rights and laws had been removed to the field of inter- national law. .. ." 106 The introduction of the principle of individual as against state responsibility into international law will inevitably create "correlative rights and privileges . . . to an utterly unknown degree." '1 The charge that the program will promote "state socialism, if not communism, throughout the world" 108 is supported by allega- tions that it will foster "economic and social boons, bounties and benefits" which encourage a "planned economy or welfare state," 109 that it is "paternalistic" and "minimizes the incentive for initiative and progress," 110 and that it emphasizes "rights" but not "respon- sibility." 11 From a view, as parochial as unrealistic, it is urged that 101.

This limitation in the Charter, whatever meaning may eventually be ascribed to it or whoever may eventually be decided to have power to interpret it,115 is a limitation only on the organization set up by the Charter and upon activities which depend upon the Charter for their constitutional base.116 The proposed Covenant on Human Rights and 112.

The assurances, therefore, of Mr. Stettinius that domestic questions were reserved at San Francisco-assurances upon which Mr. Rix heavily relies (see Rix, 618)-are irrelevant in so far as the substance of the Covenant and the Genocide Convention is con- cerned. Referring to the enlargement of the scope of Art. 2, paragraph 7, to cover "activi- ties of the organization as a whole, instead of limiting it to the pacific settlement of disputes as had been proposed at Dumbarton Oaks," Mr. Stettinius stated that "the possi- 1949] 77</page><page sequence="19">THE YALE LAW JOURNAL the Genocide Convention are to be new agreements, stemming from the same nation-state power, "the competence attached to sovereignty," 117 that established the United Nations Charter and which remains competent to clarify or supplement the obligations assumed in that Charter to promote respect for and observance of human rights. There is nothing in the United Nations Charter or in any other inter- national agreement or in customary international law which derogates in the slightest degree from the power and competence of the members of the United Nations to make further agreements about human rights and to establish common standards, to whatever extent desired, about practices within their respective jurisdictions, "domestic" or otherwise.l18 The obvious and fundamental principle of customary law is well stated by Sir Arnold McNair: ". .. international law regards a State as being invested for international purposes with complete power-vis-a-vis another contracting party-to alienate or otherwise affect the rights of its nationals, both property and per- sonal, and to impose liabilities upon them." 19 More affirmatively, it bility is now definitely excluded" that "the Economic and Social Council could interfere directly in the domestic economy, social structure, or cultural or educational arrangements of the member States."

Compare the official remarks of Committee 11/3 at San Francisco relating to the ob- jectives of the Economic and Social Council: "There were some misgivings that the statement of purposes now recommended im- plied that the Organization might interfere in the domestic affairs of member countries. To remove all possible doubt, the Committee agreed to include in its records the following statement: "'The members of Committee 3 of Commission II are in full agreement that nothing contained in Chapter IX [International Economic and Social Cooperation] can be construed as giving authority to the Organization to intervene in the domestic affairs of member States.' (Italics supplied.) "The Committee agreed that it was desirable to reinforce the statement of purposes by a pledge on the part of individual members. The precise wording of the pledge was extensively debated and the form finally agreed upon reads as follows: "'All members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the Organization for the achievement of these purposes.'

See also the decision that it is for the Organization to "promote" human rights, but for the States to "protect" them, except where "rights and freedoms are grievously out- raged so as to create conditions which threaten peace or obstruct the applications of pro- visions of the Charter," when they cease to be the sole concern of each State. 6 id. at 705. 117.

It cannot in fact be disguised, by any amount of reverent invocation of irrelevant technicalities, that the real issue posed for the United States, as for every other nation-state, is the policy issue: whether it should enter into new agreements of the type proposed.121 The critical 117, at 804. Potter, Inhibitions Upon the Treaty-Making Power of the United States, 28 AM. J. INT'L L. 456, 463 (1934) writes: "[I]nternational law bestows a plenary power of concluding treaties upon every State. A priori, and in the absence of any valid restrictions of a special nature arising from either national or international sources, the power of the United States and of its treaty- making agency to conclude agreements with other states which are mutually acceptable to both is unlimited, in terms of either subject matter or of type of treatment for that subject matter to be provided in the agreement, assuming freedom from the exercise of force or fraud upon the negotiators at the time of concluding the treaty. Such plenary power continues to accompany, or stand back of, and possibly exceed, the degree of treaty- making power purporting to be granted by the national constitution. The making of treaties by the states antedated the formation of modern international law, and the latter emerged as a result of that process, but today it is international law which sustains treaty- making, and that in plenary degree." 120.

This is the issue even if one assumes, as the bar leaders insist, that Article 2(7) of the United Nations Charter is relevant and that for the purposes of that Article the United States is the exclusive judge of what is within its domestic jurisdiction. The United States must still determine what it will consider within its domestic jurisdiction. With the bar leaders' horror of the suggestion that the interpretation of Article 2(7) may be a matter of international concern, may be contrasted Judge Hudson's strictures on this same article in The World Court: America's Declaration Accepting Jurisdiction, 32 A.B.A.J. 832, 835 (1946): "This text marks a distinct retrogression. Unlike that in the Covenant, and unlike the previous Declarations accepting the Permanent Court's jurisdic- tion, it provides no competent forum for the determination of the question whether a mat- ter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The insight and vision of earlier bar leaders with respect to the comparable problem of the jurisdiction of the International Court are indicated in Hudson, supra; Preuss, Questions Resulting from the Connally Amendment, 32 A.B.A.J. 660 (1946), and Juris- diction of World Court: Reasons for Urging a New American Declaration, 33 A.B.A.J. 79 1949]</page><page sequence="21">80 THE YALE LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 59: 60 question in simplest terms is whether or not the human rights and security, in the sense of freedom to pursue all values by democratic procedures, of the people of the United States, and of any other peoples with whom they identify, are sufficiently at stake to justify the United States in assuming obligations of the kind proposed in return for other nation-states assuming reciprocal obligations. Rational answer to this question depends, not upon exercises in authoritative doctrine, but upon correct orientation in realm of fact-in the realm of present degrees of, and probable future trends in, interdependence among the peoples of the world with respect to human rights and security. Mr. Holman's insistence upon the separateness of the problems of human rights and peace, with documentation by reference to the course of Nazi Germany, suggests a very considerable disorientation. Because of the demands, conditions, and trends indicated in the introductory paragraphs of this article, we prefer to take our stand with the great bulk of mankind-witness the general consciousness pervading not only the declarations of war aims and the framing of the United Nations organization and its subsidiaries, but also the subsequent pronounce- ments and practices of the United Nations agencies and the late frantic scrambling for regional pacts and associations-who see both a general, irrevocable interdependence of all peoples everywhere as to all values and a specific connection between the internal tyranny of nation-states and their external aggression.122 For resolution of the issue of policy thus posed for the United States and other nation-states, one fact at least is certain: there is nothing in the technical concept "domestic jurisdiction," whether considered generally or as put forward in the United Nations Charter, that offers any guidance. The words "domestic jurisdiction" are neither possessed of any intrinsic or absolute meaning nor are they self-defining.123 Neither official pronouncement nor practice of states has ever given them a very precise meaning for any purpose, much less of relevance to rational action about human rights in the contemporary world.124 Introduced into the Covenant of the League of Nations on the sugges- tion of American statesmen in the vain hope of appeasing isolationist sentiment, this "mischievous phrase" has, in the apt description of a distinguished critic,125 become a "new catchword" or verbal "idol" 430 (1947); Withdrawal of Connally Amendment as to the World Court is Urged, 34 A.B.A.J. 186, 256 (1948). 122. It surely cannot be seriously suggested that Russia's systematic exclusions from access to political power, repression of all opposition, and iron-curtain policy with respect to enlightenment have no bearing on her foreign policy or her peoples' willingness to ac- cept that policy. 123.

That function is much too often to put a stop to thought, to summarize conclusions reached on unexpressed or perhaps even unexamined or unconscious grounds, and to assert arbitrary refusal to negotiate or cooperate on problems regarded by other states as of common concern. When definition is proferred by disinterested authority, it is invariably cast in terms of relativity.'26 Thus, the Permanent Court in a much quoted passage asserted: "The question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a state is essentially a relative question; it depends upon the development of international relations." 127 Such definition obviously merely restates the question of the facts about world-wide interdependence. It may be instructive to note that in all the discussion that attended the framing of Article 2(7) of the United Nations Charter very little effort was devoted to clarifying the mean- ing of the limitation proposed for the organization. The record of San Francisco reveals (1) a design to extend the scope of paragraph 7 (limited in Dumbarton Oaks to the pacific settlement of disputes) to all the organs and activities of the United Nations, (2) a considerable diversity of opinion as to who should interpret the paragraph, (3) a belief that "essentially" is broader than the League word "solely," and (4) some notion that traditional international law is too vague and antiquated to assist in definition; but there is practically no dis- cussion of what in substance constitutes "matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." 128 There is evidence indeed of deliberate intent to postpone clarification for the future development of practice. Thus, Mr. Dulles for the United States, in rejecting the standard of international law, "pointed out that international law was subject to constant change and therefore escaped definition," and insisted that "it would, in any case, be difficult to define whether or not a given situation came within the domestic jurisdiction of a state." 129 "In this era," the official paraphrase continues, "the whole internal life of a country was affected by foreign conditions." The record reads: 130 "In summary, Mr. Dulles stressed the virtues of the principle- its breadth and its simplicity. The Organization in none of its incisive analysis.

Moreover, this principle was subject to evolution. The United States had had long experience in dealing with a parallel problem, i.e., the relationship between the forty-eight states and the Federal Government. Today, the Federal Government of the United States exercised an authority undreamed of when the Constitution was formed, and the people of the United States were grateful for the simple conceptions con- tained in their Constitution. In like manner, Mr. Dulles foresaw that if the Charter contained simple and broad principles future generations would be thankful to the men at San Francisco who had drafted it." When Mr. Dulles had concluded, "the Chairman moved a vote of thanks" for "his masterly exposition" and "Mr. Evatt rose to second this motion." Clearly "domestic jurisdiction" still awaits content from the realities of the contemporary world power process. Equally unenlightening for rational policy decision by the United States or others is the doctrinal half-truth, paraded by the bar leaders, that traditional international law concerns itself only with states and not with individuals. Even if it were a fact that traditional doctrines designed to regulate relations between nation-states in "an unscientific age of subsidized piracy, matchlocks, wood fires and candlelight, wide-open spaces, and glorification of cruel aggressive force for selfish profit" 131 were not designed and did little to protect the individual human being, that fact would be of little relevance to the task of defining doctrine and creating institutions appropriate for protecting the individual human being in this atomic era. It is not questioned of course that in recent centuries nation-states have been the principal participants in the world power process and that by reason of habitual anthropomorphic reification such states have been made the principal addressees of the doctrines of international law. The fact is, however, despite all the hair-splitting about the "subjects" and "objects" of international law, the ultimate beneficiary of its doctrines has always been the individual. In eloquent castigation of the reiterated view that international law "is a law between states" under which "in- dividuals have no rights and no personality," Professor Frederick Dunn states: 132 "In my view, this particular legal fossil is highly mis- leading and in large degree false, and its continued hold on the minds of many people explains in part why international law is held in such ill repute by laymen today." Referring to the common rule that inter- national law is part of the law of the land, Lauterpacht praises the 131. Borrowed from Bingham, The Continental Shelf and the Marginal Belt, 40 AM. J.

Clearly it was a principal considera- tion in the efforts of Grotius, the accepted father of international law, to restore order to the troubled world of the seventeenth century. It is indeed only from the narrowest perspectives of international law as conceived in the period since Bentham that an observer can claim that even theoretically only states, exclusive of individuals, are the subjects of international law. Apart from theoretical considerations, nineteenth century international law, oriented as it was to utilitarian- ism and laissez-faire, has in fact promoted the interests of individuals rather than bare relations between sovereign states. This is the import of rules regarding the diplomatic protection of citizens abroad, of the laws of war and of neutrality, and of many of the doctrines about juris- diction.138 One has, furthermore, only to look at the content of treaty- law to gain true perspective as to the preponderance of concern for the activities of men over the inter-relations of states.139 Treaty-law re- veals also the beginning of a trend toward an increased role for the individual in the procedural aspects of international law. Witness the granting of the right of individual access to international tribunals, such as the Central American Court of Justice, or the Arbitral Tri- bunals set up after the first World War.140 In more recent years the 133.

Even if it be assumed that by customary international doctrine nation-states have been left largely free to treat their own citizens as they will, the conclusion that such states cannot agree, or that it is unwise for them to agree, to do other- wise is a transparent and arrogant non-sequitur. As the American Bar Association's thoroughly considered monograph, The International Law of the Future, recites with documentation: "Instances are numerous in which states have assumed international obligations with respect to the treatment of their own nationals." 143 Wholly apart from agree- ment, states have long assumed a prerogative of humanitarian in- tervention "when a State renders itself guilty of cruelties against and persecution of its Nationals, in such a way as to deny their fundamental human rights and to shock the conscience of mankind." 144 Drawing (1941); JESSUP, A MODERN LAW OF NATIONS 18-19 (1948); Idelson, supra note 135, at 60; Aufricht, Personality in International Law, 37 AM.

Along with crimes against peace and war crimes, Article 6 of the Charter lists crimes against humanity: "Namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecution on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated." Though limited by the judgment of the Tribunal to "inhumane acts, in connection with the planning or waging of aggressive war," 148 this concept of crimes against humanity is capable of future generalization. The significance of the predecent is best stated by Professor Lauterpacht: "Crimes against humanity are crimes regardless of whether they were committed in accordance with and in obedience to the na- tional law of the accused. Such acts were deemed to violate the sanctity of human personality to such a degree as to make irrel- evant reliance upon the law of the State which ordered them. To lay down that crimes against humanity are punishable is, there- fore, to assert the existence of rights of man grounded in a law 145. Supra note 143, at 35-37. 146. Id. at 36. 147. An excellent brief summary appears in INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION, UNITED NATIONS, THE CHARTER AND JUDGMENT OF THE NtRNBERG TRIBUNAL (1949). Other contemporary rejections of the "act of state" doctrine also demonstrate that the relation between a state and its own citizens is not the sacrosanct citadel that some my- thology suggests, Comment, 57 YALE L. J. 108 (1947). Note especially the acts of allied military government in setting aside Nazi expropriations. If it is possible to act after the fact to make amends, how much more rational to act before the event to prevent inhumani- ties from occurring. 148.

Thus, upon analysis, the enact- ment of crimes against humanity in an international instrument signifies the acknowledgment of fundamental rights of the in- dividual recognised by international law." 149 The power of agreement to vary customary doctrine and impose special obligations upon states in the treatment of their own citizens has, as the Bar Association monograph suggests, been many times demonstrated. Among the better known examples are the "minorities treaties" after World War I for the protection of racial, linguisitic, and religious groups, and the more general provisions in the peace treaties concluded since World War II.150 Mention might also be made of "an imposing array" 1"1 of agreements for repressing slavery and the slave trade, for promoting humane conditions of labor, for preventing white- slavery, for policing opium trade, for protecting aborigines, for safe- guarding health, and so on.152 The agreement we should like most to emphasize is, however, the United Nations Charter itself. It is simple anachronism to suggest that the proposed Human Rights Covenant and the Genocide Convention embody revolutionary innovation. Whatever innovation there is, the decisive break with all past unconcern of cus- tomary international law for human rights, the generalization of all the many precedents indicated above into a principle of positive concern, came with adoption of the Charter four years ago. "It is already law," writes Ambassador Jessup in contrast to Mr. Rix, "at least for Members of the United Nations, that respect for human dignity and fundamental human right is obligatory. The duty is imposed by the Charter, a 149. Lauterpacht, The Subjects of the Law of Nations, 64 L. Q. REV. 97, 104 (1948).

WRIGHT, HUMAN RIGHTS AND WORLD ORDER 15 (Commission to Study the Or- ganization of Peace, 1942). For international control of atomic energy the United States has proposed a system of inspection which would invade the relations between a state and its citizens, and few ob- servers outside the Soviet Union doubt that such a measure is necessary to adequate en- forcement of security. See SHILS, THE ATOMIC BOMB IN WORLD POLITICS (1948); INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF ATOMIC ENERGY, GROWTH OF A POLICY (U. S. Dep't State, 1946); and POLICY AT THE CROSSROADS (1948). The important point is not whether a proposed agreement interferes in the relations between a state and its citizens, but whether the objectives of the parties, considering the whole context in which they find themselves, require such interference. If it is necessary to the adequate protection of human rights and to security to require states to assume obli- gations with respect to their own citizens, such action is no less rational and no more con- trary to international law than the proposed inspection system for atomic energy. 86 [Vol. 59: 60</page><page sequence="28">RIGHTS OF MAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY treaty to which they are parties." 153 Similarly, Professor Lauterpacht insists that the human rights provisions of the Charter are not "mere embellishment of an historic document" 154 but rather constitute binding legal obligation, recognizing "fundamental rights of the in- dividual independent of the law of his state." "The Charter of the United Nations is," he writes, "a legal document; its language is the 153. JESSUP, op. cit. supra note 142, at 26, 91. For clarity of thinking it is necessary to observe a distinction between binding obligation as between nations under international law and the internal or domestic effects of an agree- ment as a "part of the law of the land." To establish binding international obligation it is not necessary to establish that the terms of the United Nations Charter are sufficiently precise and "self-executing" to become the law of the land, without further legislative implementation. What agreements, in the absence of a clear expression of intent, are or are not "self-executing" under our law is still a matter of speculation and controversy.

It may be observed, however, that a promise to promote respect for and observance of human rights and free- dom is not, under common sense interpretation, compatible with insistence upon the main- tenance of internal doctrines and practices destructive of human rights and freedom and violent opposition to all change. The declarations of the framers of the Charter at San Francisco are, moreover, instructive. On the necessity for including the maintenance of human rights under the Charter, the official record states: "There was considerable discussion . . . of this point, with emphasis on the idea that respect for human rights should also be mentioned in Chapter II ["Principles," now Chapter I] as a principle to be observed by all members. It was felt that if this statement were included only in Chapter I ["Purposes," now Chapter I], it would bind only the Organization and would relieve member governments from the obligation to respect the fundamental freedoms of individuals within their own countries."

Four Justices of the Supreme Court have, further, indicated a sense of obligation to take into account the policy embodied in the United Nations Charter in decisions about human rights. Justice Black, with whom Justice Douglas agreed, concurred in the California Alien Land Law case, Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633 (1948), declaring that one of the reasons why the law is bad is that "we have recently pledged ourselves to cooperate with the United Nations to 'promote . . . universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion' [citing the Charter, Articles 55c and 56]. How can this nation be faithful to this international pledge if state laws which bar land ownership and occupancy by aliens on account of race are permitted to be enforced?" Id. at 649-650. And in the concurring opinion of Justice Murphy, who was joined by Justice Rutledge: "The Alien Land Law stands as a barrier to the fulfillment of that national pledge. Its inconsistency with the Charter, which has been duly ratified and adopted by the United States, is but one more reason why the statute must be condemned." Id. at 673.. For further confirmation of this interpretation, see Namba v. McCourt, 204 P.2d 569, 579 (Ore. 1949). Compare the companion Canadian case, In re Drummond Wren, 4 D.L.R. 674 (1945).

In affirming repeatedly the 'fundamental human rights' of the individual, it must of necessity be deemed to refer to legal rights-to legal rights recognized by in- ternational law and independent of the law of the State." 155 It is, therefore, the task and opportunity of the proposed new agreements, not to innovate in principle, but to translate obligation already as- sumed into concrete detail in the practice of states. Though irrelevant to establishing the unimpaired power of nation- states to make new agreements about human rights, the practice of the various organs of the United Nations under the Charter during the past four years is relevant as evidence of the common consensus of mankind that all peoples everywhere are interdependent as to human rights and security.'56 Contrary to the broad interpretation favored by the bar leaders, Article 2(7) has proved little impediment to the competence of United Nations organs to take action in a number of situations which might from isolationist perspectives be regarded as involving "essentially" domestic questions.157 Thus, in the Spanish case in 1946 both the Security Council and the General Assembly took jurisdiction of questions about the nature of the Spanish government. In the view of the majority of the Council the Franco regime was re- garded as likely to endanger international peace and security within the meaning of Article 34, a fact that called for action by the Council under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement of Disputes).158 In reply to the objection that Article 2, paragraph 7, prohibited such action Dr. Evatt (an enthusiastic supporter of a broad scope for Article 2(7) at San Francisco) 159 explained: "Then, I return to the object of the action in order to demon- strate that this matter is not essentially one of domestic concern. 155. Lauterpacht, supra note 149, at 101, 102. 156. Further evidence of the concern of the peoples of the world for human rights may be found in the Draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States, just completed by the International Law Commission of the United Nations for submission to the General As- sembly. Article 6 of this draft reads, "Every state has the duty to treat all persons under its jurisdiction with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, without dis- tinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." Mr. Koretsky (Soviet Union) and Judge Hudson (United States) voted against the draft declaration. According to Sohn, The Development of International Law, 35 A.B.A.J. 688, 689 (1949): "Judge Hudson stated that he voted against the Draft Declara- tion because the provisions of its Article 6 went beyond the Charter of the United Nations and beyond international law at its present stage of development." It may be noted that Judge Hudson stood alone on this point and be re-emphasized that, whatever existing doctrine, there is no doctrine to preclude states from making new agreements. 157.

The argument, therefore, that the United Nations and the Security Council or any other Members of the United Nations, cannot touch this matter, because it merely affects internal affairs in Spain is unsubstantial and should be rejected." 160 And again: "If the facts indicate that that regime, by its nature, by its con- duct, by its operation is likely to interfere with international peace and likely to be a menace to its neighbors, then the existence of that regime is no longer a matter of essentially domestic jurisdic- tion." 161 The General Assembly on its part was even more emphatic. In support of a resolution adopted barring Spain from membership in the United Nations and recommending withdrawal of ambassadors, M. Alfaro of Panama stated: "But the dogma of non-intervention has nothing to do with the great system of collective action that we set up by the Charter at San Francisco. Arbitrary intervention infringes upon the princi- ples of independence. Collective action is based on the doctrine of interdependence. Collective action is foreseen, authorized, and agreed upon in specific provisions of the Charter, and it is indis- pensable for the United Nations to exert, because without collec- tive action we cannot have peace and security, we cannot promote human rights, we cannot have disarmament, we cannot make the trusteeship regime work, we cannot have international co-opera- tion, we cannot accomplish any of the great, vital, basic principles, for which we have organized the world community of States .... "To invoke Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter against this resolution is to miss the point entirely. We are not dealing here with any matter essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Spain. We are making recommendations that concern only the individual sovereignty of the Members of the United Nations, be- cause each nation is absolutely free to maintain or not to maintain ambassadors or ministers in any given country. I will conclude by stating that situations that are an actual or potential danger to the peace of the world, and constitute a continuous, notorious, grave and shocking violation of the most elementary human rights, are ization of intervention by the organization in cases arising under Chapter VII (Action with Respect to threats to the Peace, breaches of the Peace, and acts of Aggression)-see the final phrase of Art. 2(7)-is limited to cases where enforcement measures under that Chapter are required. 160.

Further illustration could be offered by reference to the Greek and Indonesian cases.'64 Whatever the actual facts of world-wide interdependence, is it clear that the representatives of the peoples assembled in the United Nations regard the human rights and security of all peoples as indivisible. It is difficult to believe that so many observers, from such different vantage points around the world and representing such diverse cultures, can all be wrong. V The second major charge of the bar leaders that United States' participation in the United Nations program is unconstitutional as beyond the scope of the treaty or other federal power is equally with- out merit. Both Supreme Court opinion and the opinion of leading publicists make it clear, on the contrary, that our participation is well within the scope of the treaty and other federal power. Undefined in the Constitution itself, the treaty power has always been regarded as sufficiently broad and expansible to cover all matters of genuine international concern, under whatever conditions a chang- ing world context may impose. No treaty has ever been held uncon- stitutional,165 and it is the general consensus that outside of certain wide limitations there is no subject about which a treaty may not be made.166 The prevailing interpretation of the several relevant clauses 162.

Riggs in 1890: 168 "The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that in- strument against the action of the government or of its depart- ments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter without its consent. . . . But with these exceptions, it is not perceived that there is any limit to the questions which can be adjusted touching any matter which is properly the subject of negotiations with a foreign country." 169 It is immediately apparent that the limitations as to agreements which seek basically to change the Constitution or "authorize what the Con- stitution forbids" are not relevant to the present question.

The only relevant limitation (beyond the safeguards of the Fifth Amendment, to be discussed below) is that which limits the subject matter of a treaty to questions "that properly pertain to our foreign relations." 171 Chief Justice Hughes expressed this point succinctly: "It seems to me that, whatever doubt there may originally have been or may yet linger in some minds in regard to the scope of the treaty-making power, so far as it relates to the external concerns of the nation there is no question for discussion. I think it perfectly idle to consider that the Supreme Court would ever hold that any treaty made in a constitutional manner in relation to external con- cerns of the nation is beyond the power of the sovereignty of the United States or invalid under the Constitution of the United States where no express prohibition of the Constitution has been violated." 172 The still leading case on the scope of the treaty power is Missouri v. Holland,'73 holding that the treaty power may be extended even be- yond the limits of the powers expressly delegated to the Congress, when those powers are too narrowly construed to permit effective action on matters of national interest and international concern. The decision in this case sustained an act of Congress, adopted under the "necessary and proper" clause, to implement a treaty made with Great Britain for the protection of migratory birds traveling between the United States and Canada. Two lower courts had held uncon- stitutional an earlier act of Congress, not in aid of a treaty but designed to secure the same end.174 Speaking for the Court, Justice Holmes said: "Whether the two cases cited were decided rightly or not they cannot be accepted as a test of the treaty power. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under 170.

It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized gov- ernment' is not to be found. . . . [W]hen we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen com- pletely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be con- sidered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that Amendment has reserved .... No doubt the great body of private relations usually fall within the control of the State, but a treaty may override its power. . . . Here a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude is involved. It can be protected only by national action in concert with that of another power." 175 What is of "external" or "international" concern, it may be added, need not be exclusively so. In many instances, if not in most, there is a concurrence of interest which has both domestic and foreign ap- plication. Local matters can, as in the Holland case they did, become as Hughes suggests "so related to international matters that an in- ternational regulation could not appropriately succeed without em- bracing local affairs as well." 176 It may reasonably be assumed that what are matters of international concern for determining the scope of the treaty power is in the last analysis a question, not of derivation from authoritative doctrine, but of fact and of contemporary fact. The concern of the peoples of the world for human rights and the international character of such rights for the purposes of international law have already been sufficiently demonstrated. Nothing in the context of the creation of our Consti- tution or in the subsequent history of our constitutional development 175. 252 U. S. 416, 433-434, 435 (1920). 176. Hughes, supra note 166, at 195; see also Feidler and Dwan, supra note 166, at 195. 1949] 93</page><page sequence="35">THE YALE LAW JOURNAL offers any barrier to the conclusion that human rights are equally of international concern for exercise of the treaty power. The constitu- tional framers plainly foresaw the possibilities of unanticipated de- velopment in the scope of the treaty power, as Madison's reluctance to specify its content shows: "The object of treaties is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external. I do not think it possible to enumerate all the cases in which such external regulations would be necessary. Would it be right to define all the cases in which Congress could exercise this authority? The definition might and probably would be defective. They might be restrained by such a definition from exercising the authority where it could be essential to the interest and safety of the community. It is most safe, therefore, to leave it to be exercised as contingencies may arise." 177 It is both certain that the framers could not have foreseen as the sub- ject of treaties such items as patents, copyrights, health, drugs, labor relations, commercial aviation, armaments, and a host of matters which have become questions of international concern since 1787,178 and equally clear from Madison's remarks that they did not see "external" matters as a fixed and unalterable category. And if this category was not intended to be fixed, and has not proved to be so in practice, "then it is obvious" as one authority points out "that the limits of the [treaty] power are coeval and coterminous with the increasing and expanding nature of the relations between nations." 179 In the face of world problems and interdependences involving every aspect of human activity to a degree unimagined even a few years ago, it seems unreal and foolish-even dangerous-to rest any question of fact or policy on a view which holds that the migration of birds can be a matter of international concern, but that the liberty and welfare of human beings cannot. It is now generally agreed, as indicated by Justice Holmes in Missouri v. Holland,l80 that the scope of the treaty power is in no way limited by the powers otherwise reserved by the Constitution to the states or by any "invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amend- ment." 181 On no point have the Supreme Court and leading author- ities been more emphatic.

State courts also have presented and re- jected the states-rights argument.'94 The contention that most of these subjects have involved aliens and thus form a particular category of state-supervised activity has little merit in the face of Missouri v. Holland,l95 which made applicable to American citizens regulations respecting the preservation of birds. And there is no need to suppose the end of this development has been reached. Many years ago Pro- fessor Borchard observed: "It is within the power of the federal government by treaty to remove from state control any matter which may become the sub- ject of negotiation with a foreign government. With the continued drawing together of the world by increased facilities for travel and communication, the subjects of common interest which require international regulation will continue to grow in extent and variety. Uniformity of legislation by withdrawal from state legislative con- trol of such subjects as marriage and divorce, labor legislation, the ownership and inheritance of property, and all matters affecting aliens would be possible by the exertion of the necessary federal treaty power." 196 Only the narrowest perspective could except the human rights pro- gram from the scope of power otherwise so broadly conceived. Coming explicitly to the Tenth Amendment, it is clear that this famous constitutional truism imposes no limit on the treaty power. Nowhere in the constitutional debates, either federal or state, is there any indication that such limitation was contemplated. As Burr points out: "The very language of the amendment would seem to establish this fact. What are the powers reserved to the States thereby? 'The powers' first, says the amendment, 'not delegated to the Supp. 1119 (Surr. Ct. 1900); Matter of Lobrasciano, 38 Misc. 415, 77 N. Y. Supp. 1040 (Surr. Ct. 1902); McEvoy v.

Now, by the Constitution the power to make treaties is specifically granted to the Federal government in the Second Section of the Second Article, and specifically prohibited to the States by the Tenth Section of the First Article. . . . The reserved rights of the States are necessarily and by virtue of the very words of the Tenth Amendment, those rights which remain after the grant, first, of the treaty-making power, and second, of the power of Congress to legislate upon certain subjects. The Tenth Amendment, therefore, leaves the treaty-making power of the United States unaltered and precisely as granted by the Constitution." 197 The cases, already referred to, holding treaties superior to state law confirm this position. If, as has been held, the Tenth Amendment is merely "declaratory" and of no effect as a bar to broad congressional powers under the commerce clause,198 it has even less cause to be revived in order to cut down the treaty power. The conclusion is thus inevitable: the Amendment is wholly immaterial, both as to the pro- visions of treaties themselves and to the legislation supplementing them. 99 The wisdom of the conclusion that state power does not restrict treaty power is demonstrated by a glance at the alternative. "Were it true," it is suggested, "that the United States could not enter into treaties affecting matters understood to be generally reserved to the States . . . the result would be an intolerable restriction upon the power of a sovereign nation." 200 The United States would not in fact be sovereign in the sense of having real power to protect itself in world affairs, a point which Justice Holmes emphasized in Missouri v. Holland in urging that "it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters re- quiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found." 201 197.

There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declara- tory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it has been es- tablished by the constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers. ... From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end."

Though the treaty-power and the delegated and inherent powers of Congress frequently refer to the same events in our international affairs they are concurrent, not con- flicting.202 It is suggested by Professor Corwin that the power to appropriate money and possibly to incorporate territory are excep- tions.203 But with that question we need not concern ourselves here, neither problem having relevance to the human rights program. It is sufficient to note that treaties have dealt again and again with sub- jects otherwise delegated to Congress. Witness, for example, the array of agreements, which might otherwise be regulated under the commerce power, affecting customs duties and regulating commerce.204 Treaties have also extended to copyrights, naval armament, and taxation, each of which equally comports with a specifically granted Congressional power.205 That there is no conflict is evidenced in the unquestioned rule of law that treaties may supersede prior Congressional acts. On this point it was stated in Foster v. Neilson,206 a case involving the validity of the Spanish grants in West Florida and the effect to be given to the Treaty of 1819 with Spain: "Our Constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in Courts of Justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision." 207 This is not to say that the converse is not also true, that an act of Congress of later date may not override, from the point of view of domestic law, the provisions of a treaty.208 But this fact is irrelevant to the question of limitation of the treaty power; it is only concerned with the termination of individual rights created by treaty and, more- CONSTITUTION AND WORLD ORGANIZATION 14-15 (1944) ; Hughes, supra note 166, at 194; Butler, supra note 170, at 178. 202.

Speaking of the Chinese Exclusion case,210 which concerned just such an abrogation by act of Congress of the Treaty of 1881 with China, Burr remarks: "Yet nowhere creeps in a suggestion that the provisions of the treaties with China dealing with and regulating commerce and immigration, are ineffective as laws; indeed, the cases are suffused with the light of the contrary assumption and constitute direct and positive decisions recognizing and establishing the efficacy of treaty provisions propriore vigore." 211 From the preponderance of cases in this vein and of like authoritative opinions it is clear that congressional powers impose no constitutional bar to the protection of human rights through the treaty power. A very good case can indeed be made for the converse proposition that the treaty power imposes no limits on the powers of the whole Congress and that there exists through a combination of the powers of the Congress and the President a plenary federal power over foreign affairs which offers a procedure, completely interchangeable with and alternative to the treaty, for the making and implementation of inter- national agreements.212 It is not disputed today that the President has exclusive control over the actual conduct of all negotiations with other nations and that he is the appropriate authority to make final utterance of an agreement as the international obligation of the United States.213 It is likewise clear that the whole Congress has wide powers, granted by the express terms of the Constitution and exercised in hundreds of instances since the beginning of our history, to frame policies to guide 209.

Thus, the war power is held not restricted to "the winning of victories in the field and the repulse of enemy forces," but to extend to "every matter so related to war as substantially to affect its conduct and progress." 221 Embracing the daily intricacies of the national economy, this power has been invoked to sustain as late as in 1948 the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 on the ground that war does not end with the cessation of hostilities.222 Simi- larly, the Supreme Court, in Justice Murphy's words, now insists "that the federal commerce power is as broad as the needs of the nation" and that it cannot "deny that Congress can effectively deal with problems concerning the welfare of the national economy." 223 The foreign commerce clause shares this broad construction and has 214.

Speaking for a unanimous court in this case, University of Illinois v. United States,24 Justice Hughes commented: "In inter- national relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade, the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power." The power of Congress to control aliens, though not a specifically delegated power, charts the same course. In Fong Yue Ting v. United States,225 Justice Gray upheld deportation of aliens at the option of Congress saying: "The United States are a sovereign and independent nation, and are vested by the Constitution with the entire control of inter- national relations, and with all the powers of government neces- sary to maintain that control and make it effective. The only government of this country, which other nations recognize or treat with, is the Government of the Union .. " And more recently a Pennsylvania statute which sought to regulate aliens was held unconstitutional, as a violation of the principle of supremacy.226 "The supremacy of the national power," said Justice Black for the Court, "in the general field of foreign affairs, including power over immigration, naturalization and deportation, is made clear by the Constitution, was pointed out by the authors of The Federalist in 1787, and has since been given continuous recognition by this Court." 227 Supplementing these powers of the Congress, the powers of the President as "the Executive," 228 as "the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy," 229 etc., and as agent for Congress, make up a full complement of powers adequate to deal with all phases of international life. Independent of Congress, the President may negotiate agreements with foreign nations within the scope of his own delegated powers,230 while as agent for Congress, under its powers as recited above, it has been customary for the President since 1792 to negotiate international agreements on a great range of important topics of ever increasing variety.231 How far the powers of the President alone extend, it is not 224. 289 U.S. 48, 59 (1933). 225. 149 U.

To augment the express powers of the Congress and the President, to close any conceivable gaps, and hence to insure the plenary character of these powers in any eventuality, there is available a well-established doctrine, the doctrine of "inherent powers" in international affairs, which "has had a long and honorable history of effective work in the national interest," 232 and which in one form or another is subscribed to by most commentators on the Constitution.233 The most famous re- cent exposition of this doctrine is that of Justice Sutherland, speaking for the Court, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corporation.234 Up- holding the power of the President to impose by proclamation, pur- suant to a Joint Resolution of Congress, an embargo on the shipment of arms, Justice Sutherland clarified the difference between federal powers in the domestic and in the international field, saying: 235 "The two classes of powers are different, both in respect of their origin and their nature. The broad statement that the Federal government can exercise no powers except those specifically enum- erated in the Constitution, and such implied powers as are neces- sary and proper to carry into effect the enumerated powers, is cate- gorically true only in respect of our internal affairs . . "It results that the investment of the Federal government with the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirma- tive grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties, if they had never been men- tioned in the Constitution, would have vested in the Federal gov- ernment as necessary concomitants of nationality.

If it be suggested that this completely comprehensive power of the Federal Government over foreign affairs can exhaust itself through the treaty power, Professor Corwin in THE CONSTITUTION AND WORLD ORGANIZATION 19 (1944) answers: "As a matter of history the notion of the indefinite scope of the treaty-making power is itself reflective of the concept of the National Government's plenary powers in the field of foreign relation and was not always conceded in earlier days." 233.

Otherwise, the United States is not completely sovereign. The power to acquire territory by discovery and occu- pation (Jones v. United States, 137 U.

From this decision and others it is clear that neither the doctrine of enumerated powers nor the separation of powers 236 doctrine has the slightest force in impeding the comprehensive and effective cooperation of the President and Congress in the field of international relations.237 In the light of these facts, it may be concluded that the United States has a choice of procedural alternatives-treaty or Congressional- executive agreement, and each fully competent-for implementing its participation in the human rights program. As emphasized by Professor Garner, Reporter for the Harvard Research Draft of the Law of Treaties, any particular choice between these alternatives is "a matter of prac- tical convenience or political expediency rather than of constitutional law."

It should be noted that Congressional-executive agreements are effective as the "law of the land" and have the same overriding effects as treaties in respect to state law. This is true even of Presidential agreements. For distinguished authority see United States v. Belmont, 301 U. S. 324 (1937); United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203 (1942). Justice Sutherland for the Court declared in the earlier case: "Plainly, the external powers of the United States are to be exercised without regard to State laws or policies. The supremacy of a treaty in this respect has been recognized from the beginning.... In respect of all negotiations and compacts, and in respect of our foreign relations generally, state lines disappear. As to such purposes the State of New York does not exist. Within the field of its powers, whatever the United States rightfully undertakes, it necessarily has warrant to consummate. And when judicial authority is invoked in aid of such consummation, state constitutions, state laws, and state policies are irrelevant to the inquiry and decision. It is inconceivable that any of them can be interposed as an obstacle to the effective operation of a federal constitutional power." Id. at 331-332.

So long as the Supreme Court sits, honors the Fifth Amendment, and is able to make its decrees effective, the tyranny they fear is illusory. The safeguards of the Fifth Amendment and the other Bill-of-Rights provisions stand unquestionably in the way of abuse of power over foreign affairs. While it is true that there has never been a square holding that the Fifth Amendment, or other prohibitions of the Con- stitution, are applicable to the substantive provisions of a treaty,239 the dicta are relentlessly consistent,240 and the consensus of opinion 241 unflagging, in affirming this proposition.

United States 245 to support a contrary conclusion. The ground for the decision in that case, which concerned the effect of an executive agreement between President Roosevelt and Litvinov, assigning the New York assets of a Russian insurance company to the United States, was that under the facts-all American creditors of the insurance company having been satisfied prior to suit by the United States-the Federal Government could in the interest of protecting general creditors of Russia in the United States be permitted to give itself priority over foreign creditors without doing violence to the Fifth Amendment. The opinion of the Court, by Justice Douglas, clearly assumed that the Fifth Amendment was applicable ("To be sure, aliens as well as citizens are entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment"), but urged that the Federal Government was no more barred by the terms of that Amendment from securing priority for itself and its nationals over foreign creditors than states were precluded from similar preference under the Four- teenth Amendment.246 Despite the sad plight of foreign creditors of expropriated Russian corporations, there is no doubt that the great protections of the Constitution remain for residents of the United States, citizen and alien. Legislation implementing treaties has, moreover, been categorically declared subject to the Fifth Amendment. It is ironic that a decision upholding slavery need be invoked to support a program for human rights. Nonetheless, in the Dred Scott 247 case the issue was the con- stitutionality of the "Missouri Compromise," an act which pursuant to Article III of the Treaty of Cession of Louisiana 248 abolished slavery (Missouri excepted) in the Louisiana Purchase area. In striking down this act Chief Justice Taney held that the taking of property in slaves without just compensation was a violation of the Fifth Amend- ment.

Even assuming that there is any danger in reaffirmation through international agreement of our respect for fundamental human rights, several remedies are ready to hand. The agreement can by its terms be made effective internally in this country only when other states similarly implement it; or reservation in such terms can be attached to our ratification; or assuming we accept immediate obligation and bad faith develops in other countries, the Congress can promptly abrogate any internal obligation. In case of bad faith by other countries, well-hallowed doctrines of international law, such as rebus sic stantibus 250 and abrogation for failure of performance, are available to discharge even any international obligation we may have assumed. VI From the perspective of centuries necessary to realistic appraisal of the United Nations human rights program, it is obvious not only that it is not impolitic for the United States to participate in that program but that it would be most impolitic for the United States to fail to assume the leadership that world events have thrust upon it. The hu- man rights program is but an integral and indispensable part of a total program designed to preserve peace and to maintain a free society for as many as possible of the peoples of the world-a program sup- ported by the whole free world and today the principal concern of our national policy and national effort.251 So far from being a product or 249. Briggs, in THE LAW OF NATIONS: CASES, DOCUMENTS, AND NOTES 432, 433 (1938), cites a surprising number of countries as in accord with the United States. He writes: "In many states the constitution or constitutional practice stipulates that international law-or at least treaties-are the law of the land. This is the practice of the United States, Switzerland, France and Belgium (with qualifications), Holland, Spain, Germany (Art. 4 of the Constitution of 1919), Austria, Estonia, Egypt, Argentina, many South American states, and possibly others." The British practice which requires an act of the executive plus approval of Parlia- ment to make an agreement the law of the land, if it brings any changes, is in fact not too different from United States practice which requires an act of the executive plus, for agreements beyond the scope of the President's own power, the approval of the Senate or of the whole Congress.

It is significant that the Russian response to the human rights program has been marked by caution only comparable to that of the American bar leaders. The Declaration [Vol. 59: 60 106</page><page sequence="48">RIGHTS OF MAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY hallmark of totalitarianism or statism of any kind, human rights guarantees, even when supplemented by concern for that economic opportunity without which no rights can be secure,252 are a product of our own liberal revolution and are indispensable to a free society. The basic element in any human rights guarantee is the presumption of private choice and the insistence that, in so far as is compatible with the best interests of the community as a whole, private choice be protected against coercion of any kind, from any possible source, governmental or otherwise. It is this emphasis upon private choice in all aspects of life which distinguishes a free society from total- itarianisms which rely and depend upon dictation, coercion, and vio- lence. The greatest single issue before the world today is whether a was found "acceptable" on the whole, but also "unsatisfactory" because among other reasons it contained no machinery for enforcement. See U. N. Document E/800, 1948, pp. 29, 30. Yet the consistent Russian position during the 1949 Session of the Human Rights Commission was that no enforcement of human rights on the international level could be tolerated. In supporting this rigid and legalistic conception of "sovereignty," Mr. Pavlov has insisted before the Commission that Article 2 paragraph 7 of the Charter would be violated if any other course were taken. See U. N. Documents E/CN4/111 (June 10, 1949); id./114 (June 16, 1949). See also Soviet Statement on Implementation Members, E/CN4/154 (June 24, 1948), in which all the draft proposals submitted for implementa- tion of human rights were rejected. In a vein all too familiar, the Soviet objection reads: "It [the Soviet Delegation] notes that all these drafts and proposals interpret im- plementation to mean not a system of measures for ensuring that human rights are im- plemented and guaranteed in every country by the State and society, but rather, a system of international methods of pressure to be exercised through special organs established for this purpose (e.g., an international court, international committee or a United Nations public prosecutor, etc.), and intended to force individual States to take particular steps connected with execution of the Convention on Human Rights. "It is clear, therefore, that such 'implementation' may become a means of interfering in the internal affairs of a State party to the Convention, and of undermining the sover- eignty and independence of particular States...." For earlier Soviet views and analysis of Soviet law see Hazard, The Soviet Union and a World Bill of Rights, 47 COL. L. REV. 1095 (1947). It is not to be expected that the Soviets will subscribe to many of the political rights regarded by the West as indispensable to freedom. To the extent, however, that they will agree to an authoritative formulation of rights that free peoples cherish, there is so much gain. To the extent that they refuse to agree, the lines between the objectives of the Soviets and other peoples are only more clearly drawn. 252. That human rights are incomplete without opportunity for economic freedom is now axiomatic. Thus Becker, in developing the principal theme of a brilliant book, MODERN DEMOCRACY (1941) writes (at p. 62): "What the average man now needs is the opportunity to acquire by his own effort, in an occupation for which he is fitted, the economic security which is essential to decent and independent living." More famous is Anatole France's reference to "the majestic equality of the laws, which forbid rich and poor alike to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread."

In an unorganized world faced with possible an- nihilation, it is a grave question whether the centuries-long trend from a coercive, caste, and immobile society toward a more and more per- fectly realized democracy can be continued, or must give way to pre- cipitous descent into the closed society of garrison-prison states, dom- inated by a new caste specializing in violence. It should need no emphasis that one condition of the survival of a free society is a vision, fortified with reasonable hopes of fulfillment, by the peoples of the world of what a free society can offer. Loyalties that are not indissolubly tied to democracy can be captured by total- itarianism. It is not suggested that a human rights program alone can embody all the conditions necessary to preserve peace and a free society in the contemporary world. The total conditions of peace and a free society must include the creation of institutions and a production and distribution of values adequate to take account of all the world- wide interdependences described above.253 In terms of institutions, this means a sufficient organization of world-wide community coercion to maintain freedom from violence and aggression and to "provide a framework of policy and regulation which will permit the peoples of the world to pursue all their values by peaceful procedures." 254 In terms of values, it means both a certain concentration and certain dispersal of power and "a certain balance of income and wealth, a lack of discrimination for reasons irrelevant to capacity under respect, a flow of realistic information under enlightenment, less destructive personality formation under character, a growing common standard of right under rectitude," and so on.255 The indispensable function among these conditions of a human rights program, with its enshrinement of the "deep historic experience" and "moral sense of mankind" 256 into world constitutional doctrine, should be clear. Its function is to clarify the values of the people of the world in terms of the values of a free society, to reinforce their expectations that they can best maximize their own personal values in such society, to cement their loyalties to such society, to promote that consensus with respect to democratic values which will reduce to the minimum the need to use coercion to compel lawless dissenters, to further the increasing identifications of free peoples with all other free peoples, and in general to predispose the peoples of the world to the creation of the institutions necessary 253.

[Vol. 59: 60 108</page><page sequence="50">RIGHTS OF MAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY to survival in this atomic era.257 To recapitulate in detail the promise of such a program in terms of all of man's basic values-in providing the access to political power upon which freedom and peace depend, in promoting the flow of enlightenment necessary to sustain democratic processes, in establishing the equality necessary for recognition of common merit as a human being and special merit as an individual, and so on-is certainly here superfluous.258 To most men of good will it is obvious that the United States has peculiar responsibilities of leadership in the human rights program, not only in aid of its own survival but, because of its paramount power position among free peoples, also in aid of the survival of all such peoples. It is common knowledge that since World War II the United States has been singularly inept in formulating a comprehensive and positive moral doctrine behind which the free people of the world can unite. In Persuade or Perish, a book too little read, a distinguished writer convincingly urges that "it is hardly an exaggeration that we must persuade or perish," 259 that we must produce a positive, world- 257. For itemization of some of the beneficent effects of earlier human rights declara- tions, see TAWNEY, EQUALITY 134 et seq. (1931). A leap from the premise that since some treaties have been regarded as mere "scraps of paper" to the conclusion that any principle, enshrined in great state papers or constitu- tional documents, must be futile and without effects on the world power process, involves a very considerable underestimation of the role that authoritatively formulated principle can be made to play in the affairs of men. A similar fallacy underlies the repeated suggestion that human rights stem from some source higher than government and that not only can government do little to secure them but also any effort by government to secure them is likely to endanger them. To recog- nize that devotion to human rights has many justifications-religious, natural law, and other-rooted deep in man's nature, it is not necessary to ignore that such rights often get scant protection in fact if they do not have government or centralized community coercion behind them. One wonders whether the opponents of the United Nations program regard the Bill-of-Rights provisions in our own Constitution as superfluous and why, in contra- diction of their premises, they shudder for the fate of any rights that may be omitted from the United Nations program. Men have always sought to secure their rights by that formulation of principle and balancing of power which we call government; the alternative to government is anarchy and rule by private violence. To fail to distinguish the moral justifications for rights from the realities of the power necessary to protect them is simple, and perhaps suicidal, intellectual confusion. 258. It will be observed that the case we make is not so much for the latest draft of the proposed Covenant on Human Rights, though we think it good so far as it goes, as for the kind of Covenant that the United States should establish as its goal. It is our judgment after detailed analysis, recital of which is not necessary to our present purposes, of both the Genocide Convention and the draft Covenant on Human Rights, that they in no way change, but rather re-enunciate, standards which we have professed in this country since the Civil War. Hence any criticism we might make of the content of the proposed agree- ments would be, not for their inclusions, but for their omissions-for their failure to in- corporate, and perhaps even to raise, more of the standards which we and other free peoples profess to honor and to regard as necessary for survival. 259.

The human rights program offers us an opportunity, un- paralleled in its potentialities, to assume and give concreteness to the moral leadership incumbent upon us. 26 So much misconception is abroad, it may bear emphasis that par- ticipation by the United States in this United Nations program for securing human rights imports no revolutionary changes in our form of government, increases no dangers of federal absolutism, and shifts no real power from the states to the federal government that the course of events has not already shifted.261 The truth is that the social and economic, and hence constitutional, structure of the United States has had no immunity from the forces that have made for interdependence in the world at large. The same forces that operate to make the world one, operate even more intensely to make this nation one, not only as to foreign affairs and domestic economy, but as to all values: the degree of democracy in participation in power processes; the sanctity, freedom from arbitrary restraint, and well-being of the individual human being; the free flow of enlightenment; and so on. For several decades this national unity and interdependence in fact have found expression at an accelerating tempo in our formal constitutional doc- trine. Concomitant with the expansion of federal power through in- terpretation of the commerce and other clauses,262 has come a striking increase of federal supervision over civil rights and liberties.263 More 260. The fear, so dramatically emphasized by the bar leaders, that the United States might by entering into new agreements expose itself to a losing battle of mutual recrimina- tions with the Russians is idle. Our practices are not so vulnerable as such fear implies; such a battle is possible under the present United Nations Charter and is going on; and there is no reason to assume that our own diplomats would be disadvantaged by having a new set of premises, assuming that the Russians subscribe, for inquiring into some of the obscurities of Russian practice. The newspapers have indeed been filled recently with stories about some questions of slave labor and of violations of human rights in Russian satellite countries. More positively we have, as indicated above, in the symbols of free- dom, democracy, and equality instruments of potentially tremendous power for capturing and holding the loyalties of peoples; to leave these symbols to the exploitation of others, who in fact make a mockery of them by denying access to the very values that make them meaningful, can only be folly. Our national concern must be, not so much for Russian criticism, as for what the rest of the world really, and should deservedly, think of us. In the words of THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON CIVIL RIGHTS, To SECURE THESE RIGHTS 148 (1947): "The United States is not so strong, the final triumph of the democratic ideal is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of us or our record." 261.

To dispel fears of novelty in the human rights program, the trend in decision by the Supreme Court to establish national standards may be indicated in detail. The chief vehicle for development has been the Fourteenth Amendment, expanded both in its application to parties and in the scope of rights protected. The criterion of what constitutes "state" action in the application of this Amendment has been pro- gressively broadened, culminating in decisions finding "state" action in unauthorized acts of state officials,266 in determinations of political crimination Since 1937, 49 COL.

Lusky, supra note 263 at 18-19, after detailed consideration of many aspects of national interest, summarizes: "The justification for Federal intervention in the field is therefore clear. There is a national interest not only in preserving a form of government in which men can control their own destinies, but in enabling the common man to see its advantages and know its feasibility. It is an interest in quelling doubts as to the practical efficacy of our system to accomplish essential justice. It is an interest in preventing deviations from our national ideal, even in local government, because deviations create such doubts. In short, it is an interest in making a belief in our system a part of the American creed." 266. Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91 (1945).

Constitutional provisions, adopted in the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, if need be, rights in- hering in a state of freedom, and belonging to American citizenship, have been so con- strued as to defeat the ends the people desired to accomplish . . . which they supposed they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental law."

Notice of accusation and an impartial tribunal are conceded an essential part of due process,279 and federal prohibition against coerced confessions in state courts has been recog- nized since Brown v. Mississippi in 1936.280 Other decisions on the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, not involving the incorporation of the Bill of Rights, show similar trends. In recent terms, equal 274. Betts v.

The conflict in the Court between the incorporation rule and the fair trial rule continues unabated. See the dissents similar to those in the Adamson case in Foster v. Illinois, 332 U.

Ct. 1247 (1949), in which Justices Black and Douglas concur in the finding that a fair trial had been denied in an issue involving the right to counsel, but explicitly state that they "think Betts v. Brady should be overruled." Id. at 1251. 277. See e.g., Uveges v. Pennsylvania, 335 U. S. 437 (1948) (failure to provide counsel for 17 year old boy held denial of due process). 278.

Freedom of speech and press includes freedom from postal censorship,284 peaceful picketing,285 and, more recently, freedom to use loud-speakers in public streets,286 and to publish despite an indefinite prohibitory statute "stories of bloodshed, lust or crime." 287 To these growing national standards, may be added the fact that in determining the constitu- tionality of a statute, the Supreme Court no longer abides by the traditional presumption in favor of the statute where civil rights are concerned,288 thus perceptibly increasing federal supervision. The commerce clause too has been a means to national standards. Two notable cases are Edwards v. California 289 and Morgan v. Virginia,290 where it was held that interstate commerce was burdened by state laws forbidding transportation of indigent persons into the state of California, in the first case, and segregating Negroes in busses traveling in interstate commerce, in the second. From this review, it is apparent that any shift in formal authority from the states to the Federal Government that might occur by our joining in an international covenant to secure human rights could only anticipate a development already rapidly going forward under other powers, a development which promises a comprehensive structure of constitutional doctrine, national in its application and adequate to secure the national interest. It may, in conclusion, be emphasized that the bar leaders' recom- mendation of the slow approach to human rights, that it is better to await the evolutionary processes of customary law and not to use agreement, that international law cannot be made in the "twinkling of an eye," misconceives every factor upon which such recommendation 281.

To go slow upon any measure which promises to enhance security, whether conceived as freedom from simple physical violence or as a broader freedom to pursue all values by democratic procedures, may in the contemporary world context be to invite destruction. A human rights program alone cannot preclude atomic or bacteriological catastrophe, but such a program can bring compellingly to the focus of world attention the needs and aspirations of mankind in terms of human dignity and may, by cement- ing loyalties to free society, be able to mobilize such aspirations in aid of security rather than destruction. The people of the United States, with their existing high standards for the protection of human rights, can have nothing whatsoever to lose by a program designed to raise standards everywhere. "The argument that the time is not ripe for extending the rule of law in relation to this or that proposal," an English writer urges apropos human rights, "appears to me unsound. Time is a forelock and, after great wars and great upheavals, that fore- lock hangs out like a bell-rope and needs to be pulled." 291 It can be rational only for the United States acting promptly and effectively after its great traditions to assert leadership in giving time's forelock a world-resounding ring. 291.
