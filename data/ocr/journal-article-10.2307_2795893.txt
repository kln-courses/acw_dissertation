<plain_text><page sequence="1">40 Ritual Purification of a Balinese Temple. By J. H. Hooykaas- van Leeuwen Boomkamp. Verhand. der Konink. Ned. Aka&amp; van Wetenschappen, Afd. Letterkunde Nieuwe Reeks, Part LXVIII, No. 4. Amsterdam (Noord HoI- Iandsche Uitgevers), 1961. Pp. 81 44 drawings, 31 photographs, index The analytical description of certain Balinese ritual objects given in this study is like putting a part of an organism under a micro- scope. Something that heretofore has been seen only on the surface, if at all, suddenly reveals itself in all its tantalizing complexity. Thus Jane Belo, who in 1953 published her monograph Bali: Temple Festival (New York), while describing the 'symbolic sweeping' or purification (melis) of a temple, speaks of the dedication of the lis, which in her words is an 'intricately composed brush-like creation of young palm leaf.' The lis is the principal instrument for cere- monial purification with holy water. Here we learn more about the lis. The first part of Mrs. Hooy- kaas's study concerns this Balinese holy-water sprinkler. The author states that, judging by the texts of relevant prayers (mantra), many of which are quoted and translated, the lis is regarded as a combina- tion of a 'living being' and 'a magical tree enchanted by Batara Siwa.' In its totality, the lis itself is a sort of deity, referred to as ' Lord Yellow Green,' an allusion to the colour of young palm leaf. A detailed anatomy of the lis discloses that it is composed of no less than 32 parts, of which 20 make up the anthropomorphic ele- ments and the rest, together with the waringin tree, represent different leaves, stalks and other plants, a dove, and other symbols potent for warding off evil. Drawings by a Balinese artist, Ida Bagus Anom of Ubud, vividly show how each component is a little masterpiece of palm-leaf-cutting and folding-an art widespread in Bali, but in this case usually executed by a daughter of a Brahnam priest, padanda. The second part of the study describes a variety of purificatory objects made of wood, bamboo and clay, called ~t~h-~t~h padudusan, the important ritual accessories for an officiating padanda. These include some 40 miniature replicas of agricultural implements and domestic utensils, including pottery, spinning wheels, looms, rice troughs with pestles, etc., and another 40 replicas of offerings and cult objects. Mrs. Hooykaas's array of minutiae in both word and picture yields to the interested student a number of insights into the nature of Balinese cults, in which the Hindu pantheon of deities and associ- ated ideas of colours, certain numbers and symbols (often no longer understood even by the priests themselves) merge with pre-Hindu indigenous beliefs and cults. Traces of these, the author suggests, can be found in the ritual objects used in the purification ceremony. This is a most welcome contribution, complementing the Belo monograph in which a temple ceremony is treated in wider context. CLAIRE HOLT</page></plain_text>
