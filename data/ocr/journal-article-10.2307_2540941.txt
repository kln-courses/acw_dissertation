Despite the fact that Machiavelli intended much of his writing for a particular audi- ence and a limited historical and political context, his work continues to generate a uni- versal appeal which has resulted in hundreds of critical studies especially in the twen- tieth century. His new Prince, for example, has provoked interpretations ranging from that by the early twentieth century political thinker, Francesco Ercole, who trans- formed Machiavelli's vision to justify the political and historical necessity of the Fas- cist "Duce," to that by the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, who saw the Prince as an "anthropomorphic symbol" of the "collective will" personifying the communist party, to the most recent study by Mark Hulliung, Citizen Machiavelli, which in rejecting the revisionist interpretations, attempts to reinstate the authenticity of Machiavelli's shocking, scandalous, and subversive quality. With Hulliung's study twentieth century humanistic scholarship on Machiavelli has come full circle. Hulliung's intense focus on the neoclassical and republican elements in Machiavelli's canon, on how he "inverted the symbols of Latin literature" and on how he "subverted the humanist creed," substi- tutes the rehabilitated vision of the Florentine with one which dresses him as a new Ro- man, a proponent of the grandeur, glory, heroism, and imperialism of the classical Republican tradition. In so doing Hulliung echoes some of the conclusions of earlier twentieth century Fascist assessments. In Chapter I, "Civic Humanism and Power Politics," Hulliung critiques contem- porary scholarship on Machiavelli's republican thought, showing how scholars have at- tempted to rationalize and justify the Florentine's shocking quality, and in so doing have tried to eradicate his sinister popular image which, Hulliung believes, is closer to the 'real Machiavelli.' Chapter II, "The Republic That Was," shows how true Machia- vellism can be equated with the best, most successful methods of governing and fight- ing devised and used by the Romans. In contrast to the ideal model offered by Rome, Florence, in Chapter III ("The Republic That Is"), offered a negative, inverted example which dramatically and instructively demonstrated the results of weak leadership, no able ruling class, and a lack of imperialistic goals. Chapter IV, "A Day and a Night in the Life of a Citizen," again quarrels with standard interpretations of Machiavelli, here refuting the idea that Mandragola is an allegory of conspiracy in politics, and positing instead the notion that the political rules of private life parallel those of public life, that indeed there is a Machiavellism of domestic, personal life. Chapters V and VI carefully detail the nature and extent of Machiavelli's dynamic dialogue with classical writers and thinkers, mostly Roman, and with his humanist compatriots. Hulliung concludes his analysis in Chapter VII, "Interpreting Machiavelli," by reiterating the objections voiced in Chapter I that Machiavelli must not be reabsorbed into the " 'great tradition' of humanitarian ideologies, be they Stoical, Christian, enlightened, liberal, or Marxist." Instead, Machiavelli is a subversive humanist conversing with the ancients and his con- temporaries, but also with us by challenging our conceptions of humanism. Hulliung's radical effort is to "save Machiavelli from his saviors ... to demytholo- gize" him, and thus to restore and authenticate his real meaning. In destroying the five versions of the standard Machiavelli he specifies in Chapter VII, Hulliung establishes his own critical approach and school of thought, one which may attract as many follow- ers as those he has so convincingly demolished.
