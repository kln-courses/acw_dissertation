<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnic Minorities, Anthropology, and Russian National Identity on Trial: The Multan Case, 1892-96 ROBERT GERACI T he accusation of human sacrifice, or ritual murder, is one of the most powerful weapons in the rhetorical arsenal of modern interethnic conflict. To claim that a people places the deliberate destruction of human life at the center of its spiritual system is to brand that people as fundamentally barbaric, incapable of meaningful or constructive interaction with the civilized world. It is well known that this charge has often been levelled by Christians against Jews.' Among the most famous incidents is the Beilis Case of 1911-13, in which a Kiev Jew was tried for the alleged ritual murder of a Russian boy. The charge, though supported by the government, was shown clearly to have been fabricated, and thanks to the outrage expressed in public and even international opinion Beilis was acquitted.2 It is not widely known, however, that less than two decades earlier there had been a close precedent in Russia involving not Jews, but one of the small Finno-Ugric tribes of the Volga region.

They were a small group of about four hundred thousand people concentrated prima- rily in Viatka, Perm, and Kazan provinces who had been indigenous to the region well before Russians settled there in the sixteenth century. They were an almost entirely rural people of agriculturalists, hunters, fishermen, beekeepers, and small craftsmen. Their tradi- tional belief system was localized, polytheistic, shamanistic, and nonscriptural, and their contact with Russian Orthodoxy may have begun as late as the eighteenth century. Only in the last third of the nineteenth century, through the efforts of missionaries (headed by N. I. Il'minskii), had their language acquired a written form. The Votiaks had no affiliation with any diaspora community or "homeland" outside the Russian Empire, and only a tiny liter- ate elite (nurtured by the Il'minskii schools) had any political consciousness to speak of. The extent of the Votiaks' Christianization was a matter of debate, since native and Christian elements had often mixed together into an idiosyncratic melange. Many Rus- sians in the Volga region generally regarded them as the least Christianized and least "civi- lized" of the Finnic peoples. Yet after tsarist policy had come to focus on Islam as the chief cultural threat to the region in the nineteenth century, official discourse usually portrayed all the Finnic peoples as naive innocents who must be rescued by the Orthodox church before they fell to Islam and the Tatars, and who would eventually yield to Christianization and complete Russification if given sufficient time and guidance.3 If the Votiaks were rarely perceived as menacing by tsarist officialdom, however, some Russian peasants in their midst reacted to their peculiarities with fear and hostility. Rumors of human sacrifices by the Votiaks circulated in the provinces of the middle Volga in the nineteenth century.4 Alleged incidents were usually not well enough substantiated to lead to criminal accusations and proceedings, but they did make their way into travellers' and ethnographers' descriptions of the Votiaks.5 In 1892 the power of such rumors coincided with the appearance of a mangled body and the eagerness of local authorities to press charges against a group of Votiaks on the basis of scant and even contrary evidence. The resulting case lasted four years and was heard three times. Two different juries convicted seven Votiak men of sacrificing a Russian to their "pagan gods." In light of procedural violations and abuses of power by local authorities in the case, both convictions were annulled by the Governing Senate, Imperial Russia's supreme court. Only the third time around were the Votiaks acquitted, largely because of the publicity brought to the case by the well-known 3For more on the I1'minskii project and its idealization of the Finnic minorities of the region see Geraci, Wizdow, esp. chap. 2. In the book, however, I also argue that around the end of the nineteenth century controversies over Il'minskii's legacy reflected the waning of many Russians' sympathy toward these peoples. Though there is little direct evidence for it, the Multan Case may represent in part the fallout from these controversies (ibid., chap. 7). 4After a spate of ritual murder accusations against Jews at rnidcentury in the Southern Volga area, Russian fears of this crime traveled north, and soon ritual sacrifice was said to be practiced not only by Jews but also by other inorodtsy.

Korolenko.6 The "Multan Case," named after the defendants' village of residence, generated extensive and heated debate in the Russian press and society. For historians, the case sheds light on a number of matters: the development of Russian judicial institutions and procedures, the role of the police in rural communities, the behavior and influence of the press, and even the history of forensic medicine. In this essay, I will use it to illuminate the history of both learned and popular conceptions of the Russian Empire as a multiethnic entity. I argue that although ostensibly the case was about the innocence or guilt of specific persons in a specific crime, in the public mind much larger matters were at stake. To present a credible motive for murder, the prosecution had to maintain that human sacrifice was in fact a part of the Votiaks' way of life. First, therefore, the entire Votiak people and their culture were being judged, and perhaps implicitly other minority peoples in Russia. Generalizations not only about Votiak culture but also about human cultures in general-particularly those made by scholar-researchers-played a pivotal role in the case and in public discussion of it. The fledgling science of anthropology (ethnography) offered some bases and methods for making such generalizations, though its practitioners did not share the same approach to or even definition of the field. Indeed, the case became a competition between different visions of anthropology, its scientific basis, and its social utility. In a way, then, anthropology itself also stood trial. Thirdly, since the Votiaks had been subject to Russian domination and cultural influence for several centuries, and were widely thought of as considerably Russified and Christianized, to many the notion of contemporary human sacrifice made the Russians and their cultural mission as vulner- able to judgment as the Votiaks. In a larger sense too, the conduct of the case itself became a commentary on the way in which Russians as a "ruling nation" governed their empire. In spite of the marginality of the Votiaks themselves, the Multan Case struck directly at the core paradox of diversity and identity in a multiethnic empire during the age of nationalism. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT On 6 May 1892, on a footpath between the Russian villages Anyk and Chul'ia and close to the mixed Russian-Votiak village Staryi Multan in Malmyzh district, Viatka province, a young girl came across a human corpse. The body was identified as that of Konon Matiunin, a Russian peasant from Kazan province who suffered from epilepsy and had come to collect alms. According to the girl's testimony, the corpse's head and neck had been cleanly chopped off, but remarkably little blood was on or around the body. An autopsy showed that Matiunin's back had been cut open, several vertebrae and ribs broken, and his 6The most detailed accounts of the case are P. N.

There were dark lacerations in his abdomen.7 In sum, the condi- tion of the body suggested a murder with some sort of occult or superstitious purpose. As soon as police arrived to investigate, they were met by Russians who told them, "The Votiaks did it." Several said they knew or had heard of the Votiaks' practice of sacrificing human beings to their gods in times of great need (as is well known, 1892 was a famine year in many villages in Russia). And in fact a beggar was said to have spent the night of 5 May in Staryi Multan. On the basis of these rumors, the police began to search the homes of Votiaks known to practice pagan worship.8 Soon Staryi Multan was overrun by a corps of investigators. The murder investigation, which stretched over two years be- cause of various gaps and changes of personnel, focused almost exclusively on this village. Eventually twelve Votiak men of the village were charged with the crime and put in prison (one died before the end of the investigation and another died awaiting trial). According to the indictment presented to the Sarapul Circuit Court in 1894 by its ambitious assistant prosecutor, Nikolai I. Raevskii, Matiunin's murder could only be ex- plained as a sacrifice to the Votiaks' pagan gods. Raevskii described Votiak sacrifices of live animals on special occasions-the role of the pagan priests in cutting the victims, the collection and drinking of blood, the removal of the head and internal organs, the reciting of prayers. Besides certain regular sacrifices of birds and sheep, he wrote, "every four or five years, special rites are performed, primarily in years of misfortune ... to the chief god, the evil spirit Kurbon. At such times some kind of large animal is sacrificed, such as a bull. ... Finally, according to witnesses, who have heard about it from Votiaks themselves, about every forty years or more, in extreme instances, in years of complete crop failure or pesti- lence ... a human sacrifice is also made to Kurbon to secure his mercy."9 The said witnesses included the local land captain, a ninety-five-year-old Russian peasant who claimed that Votiaks had nearly sacrificed his nephew about forty years previously, and a priest who had taken part in the investigation of similar incidents, none of which ever resulted in criminal proceedings. ' The indictment claimed that on 4 May 1892 the whole Votiak community in Staryi Multan had met and decided, on the basis of a vision one man had seen in a dream, to perform a human sacrifice. Only circumstantial evidence was cited against the accused. Moisei Dmitriev was suspected because he owned the shelter his clan used as a place for sacrifices, AndrianAleksandrov because of his status as a shaman in Dmitriev's clan. Kuz'ma Samsonov was known as the best butcher in the village, and the condition of the corpse was such that supposedly only he could have done the cutting. Others had been named by two Votiaks claiming to have been privy to the crime without participating in it. The prosecutor also used bits of conversation overheard by Russians, over a period of years and in many 7A. N. Baranov, V. G. Korolenko, and V. P.

It turned out that the Votiaks worshipped no god named "Kurbon." The word "kurban" is Tatar for sacrifice, and a spring holiday of local Muslims was known as "Kurban-bairam." The detail indicates either a certain degree of Tatar linguistic and religious influence on the Votiaks or the tendency of Russian peasants to lump together indiscriminately other local groups' faiths and practices. 10Ibid., 10-11.</page><page sequence="5">534 Robert Geraci cases lacking any context, to prove that the defendants had incriminated themselves. Vari- ous pieces of material evidence were also cited: hairs in a washtub, traces of blood on clothing, the damp dirt floor of Dmitriev's shelter (supposedly washed to remove blood)." The flimsiness of the prosecutor's reasoning went unnoticed by most observers, and an overwhelming consensus was reached about the Votiaks' guilt. On 10 and 11 December 1894, in the Sarapul Circuit Court, witnesses called to trial recited the same rumors used in the indictment. Raevskii referred to the supposed Jewish ritual sacrifice of children as support for the plausibility of the motive. He also applied his own logic to the Votiaks' religious practices. "About four years before the murder of Matiunin," Raevskii said, "a bull was sacrificed in Moisei Dmitriev's shelter. And it's not far from a bull to a human victim, especially after such difficult years, as in all fairness 1891 and 1892 are considered in Malmyzh district." The Votiaks had little with which to counter the prosecutor's scenario besides claims of their own innocence. Ignorant of legal procedures, they had found a lawyer, M. I. Driagin, only at the last minute. Thus the defense had missed its deadline for calling witnesses, and the court would not waive this technicality. Driagin argued that human sacrifice did not exist among the Votiaks or the Jews, but cited no particular authority on the question. His speech, according to the press, "made an excellent impression on the audience." Nonethe- less the jury, composed mostly of peasants, after two hours of deliberation ruled that seven of the ten defendants were "guilty of taking the life of ... Matiunin with premeditated inten- tion and with the purpose of making a sacrifice to their pagan gods." At the same time, the jury declared the seven "deserving of leniency," presumably because of their ignorance. Six were sentenced to ten years of hard labor, and one (ninety years old) to exile in Siberia. 12 News of the case caused an uproar in the regional press, and opinion was divided on the guilt or innocence of the Votiak defendants. It was immediately evident, however, that the public saw much larger issues at stake. The Kazan newspaper Volzhskii vestnik pub- lished a diatribe pleading for better efforts at Russification of the inorodtsy (a term usually referring to non-Russian peoples of the Asian part of the empire). "Who would deny," wrote the author, anguished by the barbarity of the supposed crime, that these pathetic, hapless Votiaks with Orthodox names-these Ivans, Semens, Vasiliis, and so on, with whom even you, my reader, have perhaps stood in a crowd-belong in heart and mind with those Pacific savages (dikarz) about whose ways you have read? It's hard to [accept the fact] that this incident occurred not somewhere in central Africa, India, or Polynesia, but just [two hundred miles] from a university city which is the center of missionary work directed toward the education of the inorodtsy. ... And yet this is a fact whose reality is not open to doubt. After this, wouldn't any European passing through say that we're barbar- ians, or at least that such are among us? And he would be right.'

In his appeal of the case to the Governing Senate in St. Petersburg, Driagin claimed that numerous laws and judicial standards had been violated in the investigation and trial. The judge had shown a clear bias in favor of the prosecution by repeatedly interrupting and intimidating the defense while it addressed the jury, and by refusing to let the defense call witnesses. The court, moreover, had not demanded that the Votiak practice of human sacri- fice be proved, and had broken the law by accepting testimony based only on unsubstanti- ated rumors. Such misconduct, Driagin implied, was meant to conceal the local authorities' bungling of the investigation and the prosecutor's misrepresentation of facts. Police had thrown away evidence that the trail of blood from the corpse had led not to Multan but to the Russian village Anyk. A discrepancy remained over which village Matiunin had slept in on the eve of his murder. The girl's testimony on two sightings of the corpse on different days suggested that it had been moved and reclothed in the interim. The body had then been kept for an entire month before an autopsy was performed. Only then did anyone notice that the lungs and heart were missing, contrary to Raevskii's claim that they were missing when the body was found. Other material evidence was not collected until several months after the murder, and the site where the body was found was not formally investigated until the next winter, when it was covered with snow.'4 In May 1895 the Senate annulled the conviction and demanded a retrial of the case in a different city with different judges and jurors. In its list of numerous violations of the judicial code by the court investigator, prosecutor, assistant prosecutor, and the Sarapul Circuit Court itself, it specifically required that the retrial bar the use of unsubstantiated rumors about the crime and about Votiak religious beliefs and instead involve the consul- tation and testimony of both ethnographic and medical experts.'5 Several periodicals applauded the Senate's action. The Populist thick journal Russkoe bogatstvo editorialized, "We will be hoping that science itself will lend its voice. ... Sci- ence has some facts and probably could give a more reliable picture of the sacrifice, as well as other superstitious ideas and rituals."' Science did soon lend its voice, or rather was drafted into the fray. Volzhskii vestnik, expressing certainty that the verdict had been correct, cited ethnographic works on the Votiaks written by the Kazan University professor Ivan N. Smirnov. 7 Smirnov's opinions became crucial to the case, and therefore should be laid out in detail. 14V. G.

SMIRNOV AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVOLUTIONISM Ivan Nikolaevich Smirnov was a priest's son born in Kazan province in 1856. After gradu- ating from Kazan's Orthodox seminary, he opted against the priesthood and enrolled in Kazan University to study history. There, eventually, he earned a doctorate for a study of Venetian-Dalmatian relations during the Renaissance. In 1886 he became a full professor of general history at the university.'8 In 1878 local enthusiasts founded the Society for Archaeology, Ethnography, and His- tory at Kazan University, one of the first organizations of its kind outside of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Serving as the society's president and editor of its journal Izvestiia for a number of years, Smirnov came to regard the study of the minority populations of the region as a civic duty. He saw no contradiction between furthering the professionalization of ethnography by enhancing its precision, on the one hand, and extending its popularity and its practice among well-educated amateurs on the other. In an 1891 public lecture, "The Tasks and Meaning of Local Ethnography," Smirnov urged middle-class professionals to engage in ethnographic research and to do so with scientific rigor: to describe all sights fully, make drawings when possible, note the location of all findings, and copy oral tradi- tion directly and without literary embellishment.'9 After reading intensively in English anthropology and social theory, Smirnov him- self began to make field trips to study the Finno-Ugric peoples of the Volga-Urals region. His research was funded by grants from the Kazan Education Circuit, and its principal fruits were separate studies of the four largest of the Finnic groups: The Cheremis (1889), The Votiaks (1890), The Permiaks (1891), and The Mordvins (1895). Each was published serially in Izvestiia and issued as a book. Smirnov's studies were largely "armchair anthropology," that is, more synthetic than based on original research. Smirnov had neither the time nor the necessary linguistic skills to do more thorough fieldwork.20 His books, nonetheless, were frequently appreci- ated by scholars for their systematicity, organization, and overviews of previous literature. Reviewing The Votiaks, one researcher called the book "the first scholarly treatment of Votiak ethnography," and predicted that it "will facilitate significantly the study of this people."21 The monographs reflected Smirnov's enthusiasm for the evolutionist model associ- ated with a number of English and American anthropologists of the 1860s to the 1880s. The recognized leader of the evolutionist school was Edward B. Tylor, the first holder of a university chair in anthropology (at Oxford). Summarizing the evolutionist point of view, Tylor wrote in 1889: "The institutions of man are as distinctly stratified as the earth on which he lives. They succeed each other in series substantially uniform over the globe, 8Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi istoricheskii arkhiv (RGIA), f. 733, op. 151, d. 583,11. 48ob.-49ob.; S. K.

He was also attracted to Marx and Spencer, and referred to evolutionism as "the English heresy" because the historical continuity it saw between primitive and civilized cultures could be interpreted as support for a secular, demo- cratic worldview.24 Yet perhaps even more than Tylor and other evolutionists, Smirnov balanced an Enlightenment-inspired belief in the "psychic unity of mankind" and the principle of "independent invention" with attention to human differences and the impor- tance of cultural diffusion.25 Although he believed in a single evolutionary sequence by which peoples develop, he thought that different peoples may have different potential for reaching successive stages on their own. Only a few peoples, he thought, are capable of innovation to the degree that their evolutionary destiny can be considered innate. Less gifted peoples reach stages of higher analytical and technological capabilities only by bor- rowing from more advanced neighboring peoples.26 Thus, according to Smirnov, the uni- formity of evolutionary stages around the globe is explained more by the superiority and influence of a few cultures over all others than by the uniformity of the human race. Into this rubric Smirnov placed the history of the peoples of the Volga region. As innately less capable, in his account, the Finno-Ugric peoples depended on the influence of the Slavs (Russians) to undergo cultural evolution. The civilizing process was for the Finns, then, tantamount to Russification. That Smirnov interpreted evolutionism in this way is not surprising. Nineteenth-century Russian historians had often described their country as one in which cultural expansion proceeded alongside geographic expansion: the Russian people grew organically as it civilized and absorbed smaller, less developed ethnic groups.27 This dynamic, including even the eventual intermarriage and mixing of minority peoples with the Russians, was commonly taken for granted by ethnographic writers in late nine- teenth-century Russia. Smirnov's novelty, rather, was in using ethnographic theory and methodology to elaborate the details of this cultural history. 22E. B.

See Margaret Hodgen, The Doctrine of Survivals (London, 1936), 67. 24George Stocking has shown that evolutionism actually could cut both ways in nineteenth-century European culture, providing tools either for subverting or reaffirming values such as patriarchy, Christianity, and class hier- archy.

A chapter on environmental conditions and material inventions followed. Then came separate chapters on family structure, religion, and folk literature, in which the pro- cess of Russification-civilization was elaborated in greater detail. Smirnov was faithful to the theories of the Western evolutionists. The chapters on family history, for instance, always followed Lewis Henry Morgan's developmental sequence, beginning with primitive communal marriage, matriarchy, and kinship terms based on age, passing through stages of levirate and polygamy, and ending with monogamy, patriarchy, and recognition only of blood relations, achieved under the influence of Christianity. In the chapters on religion, Smirnov followed Tylor's ideas on the genesis of human belief in the soul, and the sequence of fetishism (nature worship), animism (anthropomorphic polytheism), and spiritualism (monotheism)-again reflecting the Christianizing influence of the Russians.28 Smirnov thought that the Volga Finnic peoples had achieved varying degrees of evolutionary im- provement, and he attributed this to different patterns of interaction with the Russian people, determined by unique historical and geographical circumstances. In most cases, Smirnov saw this process as yet incomplete, with remnants of various primitive customs-such as pagan rituals or nonmonogamous sexual relations-still existing in one tribe or another, coexisting with Christian norms in what Smirnov often called a "compromise" position.29 In his views on cultural transmission, Smirnov was a thoroughgoing populist. He believed that Russification proceeded because of the spontaneous, unmediated influence of the Russian "peasant mass" among the inorodtsy, not because of state or church policies. "Assimilation is achieved by life itself, regardless of any instructions. It is not the state official, but the colonist, who Russifies" the Finnic tribes.30 Smirnov conceded that the state should play some role in the Russification process only because it "does not wish to remain a passive observer of what occurs in life."3" The best setting for Russification, he thought, had always been the ethnically mixed village. The formation of such villages, and therefore Russification itself, was the result of gradual economic processes.32 Through cohabitation, the Finnic tribes could see the advan- tages enjoyed by Russians in everyday material life-clothing, tools, housing-and would be lured into closer contact and greater borrowing. Inevitably, the process would culminate in the mixing of inorodtsy with Russians by means of intermarriage. New generations would be racially hybrid, but their culture would be thoroughly Russian. This ethnic ab- sorption, where it had already occurred, was so thorough that it was often mistaken for the flight or biological extinction of the minority people.33 Of immediate concern here is the prognosis Smirnov offered in The Votiaks. "The Votiaks are on the path of fusion (slilanie) 28This sequence is spelled out most clearly in Votiaki, chap. 4.

In some cases Smirnov saw even more rapid progress, as in one area where he predicted that "after two or three more decades there will remain only the vague memory of the existence of Votiaks in the parish."34 HUMAN SACRIFICE AND "SURVIVALS" Smirnov's preoccupation with human sacrifice predated the Multan Case and perhaps even played a role in bringing it about. In public lectures and in writings, he took advantage of the topic's sensational nature to generate a middle-class audience for ethnography. More- over, Tylor himself had discussed human sacrifice at length in Primitive Culture in his explication of his concept of "survivals" and in his account of the evolution of religion. Tylor defined survivals as "processes, customs, opinions, and so forth, which have been carried on by force of habit into a new state of society different from that in which they had their original home, and [which] thus remain as proofs and examples of an older condition of culture out of which a newer has been evolved."35 The apparent senselessness of survivals, their lack of current function, according to Tylor, identifies them to the an- thropologist as points of access to past stages of culture. Another means Tylor used for tapping into earlier stages in a culture's history was known in the nineteenth century as the "comparative method." This idea was simply that the synchronic comparison of cul- tures at different stages of evolution was a means of identifying the more or less universal stages of this process. The more civilized peoples, Tylor believed, could see what their forbears had experienced by looking at modern "savages" or "primitives."36 To illustrate these concepts, Tylor analyzed "the rite of laying the foundations of a building on a human victim." Citing various European legends, he maintained that this had been practiced in the distant past as a way of ensuring the protection of structures by the gods. Certain nineteenth-century habits and superstitions expressed the memory of the sacrifice: pilgrimages to sites of ancient sacrifices, the substitution of empty coffins or of animal victims in building foundations, or superstitions that the laying of a foundation will result in the death of a passerby.37 These were the end products of a progression Tylor called "sacrificial substitution," in which human sacrifice is replaced over time by less costly, less violent sacrifices. The required killing of a worshipper's family member may be substi- tuted by that of a criminal, captive enemy, or even an effigy. Other replacements could be "ceremonial mutilations"-the offering of human hair, a finger, or drops of blood-or ani- mal sacrifices. Animal sacrifices might be replaced by animal effigies or bits of food and drink. The meaning of the sacrifices, according to Tylor, also evolves from "substantial value" (satisfying a god's need of human flesh for subsistence) to "homage" (a symbolic gesture demanded by the god) or even "abnegation" (as in a sacrifice necessary for the peace of mind of the giver, but not for the satisfaction of the god). As in the case of the foundation 3"Smirnov, Votiaki, 260, 70. 3"E. B.

Human sacrifice-the most substantive form-Tylor asserted, had been reduced entirely to survivals in Europe, though it was probably still actually prac- ticed in parts of Africa and Asia.38 Beginning in 1889, Smirnov gave public lectures focusing on these issues (such as "Traces of Human Sacrifices in the Popular Poetry and Religious Rituals of the Volga Finns" and "Memories of the Epoch of Cannibalism in Votiak Folk Poetry"), referring to Tylor's ideas to explicate ethnographic data from his own research. He also mentioned human sacrifice and its survivals in his monographs on the Volga Finns. However lurid his depic- tion of the local past, Smirnov did not say that these peoples still practiced human sacrifice. He seemed certain that the custom was extinct and traceable only by means of techniques such as survivals and the comparative method.39 In The Votiaks, however, Smirnov's message became somewhat ambiguous. As we have seen, the book confidently celebrated the Votiaks' progress toward becoming Russian; it seemed unlikely, then, that Smirnov could think the Votiaks were still sacrificing humans. Yet this book carelessly muddled the distinction between the past and the present. In his zeal to prove that the Votiaks had indeed practiced ritual murder, Smirnov used some ethno- graphic sources from as recent as the 1840s to the 1880s that claimed sacrifices had been performed in the nineteenth century, even though such sources were vague, unreliable, or anonymous. Smirnov also repeated rumors he had heard on his field trip to the Votiak country about recent sacrifices or attempted sacrifices from which victims had narrowly escaped.40 In spite of statements to the contrary, Smirnov was indeed insinuating that the extinction of the practice in Votiak religion might not yet be complete. Smirnov's confusion was over more than just one aspect of Votiak culture; rather, it pervaded his entire understanding of anthropology, its methods, and its judgments. In his following book, The Permiaks, he discussed the contemporary coexistence of Christian marriage customs among this people with a permissive extramarital sexual life that in- cluded incest, orgies, and births out of wedlock. This permissiveness he identified as what the evolutionists called "primitive" sexual relations, and spoke of it as a survival of a pre- Christian epoch.4' According to Tylor, though, the notion of survivals was supposed to apply to elements of culture that no longer had any meaning or function in the present day, whereas what Smirnov referred to was evidently alive and well. By mixing the anthropo- logical definition of survival with the word's colloquial meaning, Smirnov created the im- pression that Permiak promiscuity was a survival not because it had lost its meaning or 38Ibid. 2:393-408, and 1: 106-8. Because of the widespread view that gods in primitive religions are fashioned anthropomorphically, Tylor and others (including Smirnov) thought that human sacrifice itself was evidence that primitive peoples practice cannibalism at some stage of development. Because of this association, the concepts of cannibalism and human sacrifice were often conflated in the public discourse on the Multan Case. See Smirnov, Sledy chelovecheskikhprinoshenii vpoezii i religioznykh obriadakhprivolzhskikhfinnov (Kazan, 1889), 19-21. 39Smirnov, Cheremisy, 182-86; E. F.

(The translation of Tylor's ideas from English into Russian not only did not eliminate this confusion but may even have compounded it.42) If culture traits that still exist and those that retain only some slight aspect of their original form could both be called survivals, then it is not hard to see how Smirnov conflated "survivals" of human sacrifice with the notion that the practice was still taking place. Tylor himself deserves a share of the blame, however, for mixing his metaphors. Choos- ing archaeology as a model for charting human evolution, he sought an analogue to the pieces of ancient pottery or fossilized organisms that help archaeologists reconstruct his- tory. He came up with the notion that broken-off, dead, and hardened aspects of nonmate- rial culture found in modem society could play a similar role. But at the same time Tylor was drawn to biological metaphors for cultural change, since the artifacts that interested him are not buried in the ground but somehow still present in human life-hence his choice of the term "survival." Neither analogy is entirely appropriate, and they contradict each other-the term itself suggests continuing vitality, while the supposed criterion for identi- fying survivals is defunctness.43 Even Tylor's own discussion of survivals in Primitive Culture suffered to some degree from this ambiguity.44 If Smirnov was unsure of his position on the persistence or extinction of human sacrifices in the Votiaks' religious practices, the Multan accusations tipped the balance. After examining the further stages of the case, we will see that it was not only scientific imprecision that swayed Smirnov (and many others) but also the ambiguity of predomi- nant Russian attitudes toward their empire and its peoples. ETHNOGRAPHERS ON TIE WITNESS STAND The retrial of the case took place from 29 September to 1 October 1895 in the small city of Elabuga in Viatka province. Procedurally, it was hardly fairer than the first trial. The same indictment was used, with its vague rumors of the existence of human sacrifice un- changed. The same judge presided illegally over the hearing. While permitting the prose- cution to call two new witnesses, he again turned down all of the defense's requests for 42"Survival" can be translated in two ways. Perezhitok refers to the thing that survives (with a diminutive connotation); perezhivanie could also refer to that which survives, but principally meant the act of surviving (with no necessary diminution). Smirnov used the two interchangeably in discussing Tylor's concept. The 1872 Russian translation of Primitive Culture had also used perezhivanie prominently (and in the singular) in referring to surviv- als. Only in the 1939 translation did perezhitkireplaceperezhivanie in translating "survivals" (Geraci, "Window," 301-4). 43Hodgen, Doctirine, 141, 145-48. According to Hodgen, some critics of the concept denied that any culture trait, however out of place it seems to be, can be thoroughly useless or meaningless (pp. 154-73). Marvin Harris has defended the concept against such critics by asserting that the evolutionists were well aware that "in both biological and sociocultural survivals, there is a spectrum of utility rather than a dichotomy of useful and useless" (Rise, 166). 44See Tylor's description of a woman using an old-fashioned loom rather than a new-fangled one: "this old woman is not a century behind her times, but she is a case of survival" (Priwitive Culture 1:16). Though the woman adheres to tradition, she keeps the old-style loom not purely as a curiosity. Her loom still functions, and she still uses it for weaving. A similar case is Tylor's discussion of "survivals" of symbolic magic, which, though long outdated and having lost much of its credibility, still had many credulous practitioners in the nineteenth century (ibid., chap. 4).</page><page sequence="13">542 Robert Geraci witnesses-including the three men acquitted in the first trial, who by law had to be al- lowed to testify.45 In accordance with the Senate's instructions, the court did allow testi- mony by ethnographic "experts." The prosecution invited Smirnov, and the defense sum- moned Grigorii G. Vereshchagin, a Russified Votiak teacher and ethnographer.46 Most of the prosecution's witnesses were the same village personalities who had testi- fied in Sarapul, while comparable witnesses who might present contradictory views were denied to the defense.47 But the trial held some embarrassing revelations for the prosecu- tion. While on the witness stand, two Votiak witnesses who in 1893 had told the police in detail about Matiunin's sacrifice suddenly recanted this testimony, revealing that they had given it while being tortured by the police official Raevskii had sent to Multan from another district after previous investigators had failed to find compelling evidence against the sus- pects.48 The doctor who had performed the autopsy on Matiunin, having claimed there was evidence that Matiunin had been hung upside down while still alive to drain his blood out, also recanted. Now he admitted he had made that claim under the influence of the investigator's prior judgment; in reality the blood could have been drained after death, and the abdominal blotches were perhaps not from lacerations but a rash. The ethnographers' testimony came last. Smirnov insisted that the indictment's de- scription of Matiunin's corpse "shows the full picture of a sacrifice." The professor was puzzled by a few circumstances in the prosecution's scenario that deviated from what he knew about Votiak sacrifices. Under cross-examination, however, he hinted that these con- tradictions could be explained by a "compromise permitted under the pressure of circum- stances." Raevskii recognized this as a necessary loophole for his case.49 Smirnov also used theoretical arguments in support of the practice of human sacrifice by Votiaks. "In the literature, beginning in the 1850s, there are indications that such sacri- fices were performed by Votiaks," he offered. "What the literature says can, of course, raise doubt, since the information in it is extremely imprecise, and I am obliged therefore to 45Luppov, "Iz istorii multanskogo dela," ARAN, f. 811, op. 1, d. 68,11. 19-22. 46The defense's first choice, Petr Bogaevskii, was turned down by the court probably because he had already gone public with his criticism of the case and of Smirnov. After the first conviction, he had presented his views to the ethnographic division of Moscow University's Society for the Lovers of Natural History, Anthropology, and Ethnography, and had urged that in future cases of this type ethnographers be invited to provide expertise. See P. M. Bogaevskii, "K Multanskomu delu: Sushchestvuiut li chelovecheskie zhertvoprinosheniia u votiakov?" Russkie vedomosti (7 November 1895). Even before the case, ironically, Bogaevskii had also criticized Smirnov for expecting the full Russification of the Votiaks to be completed unrealistically soon (Bogaevskii, review of Votiak/, 220). 47A priest who had served in Multan only since two years before Matiunin's murder testified for the prosecution to corroborate rumors of ritual murder. Multan's other priest, who had served there for forty years, had submitted testimony to debunk such rumors, but the court disregarded it and refused to let the defense call the priest as a witness. See Baranov et al, Delo, 79-82; S. K. Kuznetsov, "Iz vospominanii etnografa," Etnograflcheskoe obozrenie (July-September 1907): 2; and Shatenshtein, Multanskoe delo, 43. 48Baranov et al, Delo, 97-105. The judge tried to suppress the defense's probing into these allegations. 49Ibid., 161-64, 167-68, 184. First, Smirnov thought, large sacrifices must take place in public. They are performed by and for the benefit of not one clan but the entire community, and no clan ever permits members of another to enter its place of sacrifice. But the prosecution and witnesses had named as the scene of the crime a shelter belonging to only one clan, that of Moisei Dmitriev. Also, the person accused of cutting Matiunin did not belong to Dmitriev's clan, but had allegedly been hired. According to Smirnov, ethnographers know that a person must be elected to play this role, and cannot be paid for it.</page><page sequence="14">The Mutltan Case, 1892-96 543 corroborate what has been said. In science we have a device by which, if there is vagueness as to some aspect of the culture being studied, we turn to the culture of related peoples and, using the features of this culture, we add what is missing. In this consists the so-called comparative method of study. By this device we find what we lack in the literature on the Votiaks-namely, that the gods demand human sacrifices."50 Applying this logic-which was not in fact the comparative method-Smirnov sum- marized a Cheremis folktale in which a man is duped by his ailing wife into sacrificing his son (the wife's stepson), believing it is necessary for curing her illness. Also, to show that Votiak gods are cannibalistic, Smirnov mentioned various Votiak beliefs about gods chas- ing humans in order to eat them. Another type of legend, about heroes eating the heart or other parts of a conquered enemy in order to obtain certain character traits, he testified, exists "among all primitive peoples, and is not unknown even to Europeans, for example Germans, and is also seen in the Estonians and even among medieval Christians." With this Smirnov concluded, "I could go on much longer with examples, but that might be superflu- ous, and even without that my position is sufficiently proved."51 The defense's ethnographic witness, Grigorii Vereshchagin, was more modest than Smirnov both in his scholarship and in his manner. Like Smirnov, he thought there had been a period of cannibalism among the Votiaks, and noted traditions in one region which could be considered survivals of past human sacrifices.52 Yet because he disliked generali- zations and based his views only on his own observations in particular regions, he failed to refute Smirnov forcefully. He stated modestly, "I don't know about the Votiaks of Malmyzh, but in general Votiak gods do not demand human victims." Vereshchagin's tes- timony lasted only a few minutes and went virtually unnoticed.53 After the prosecutor, in a final statement, disingenuously attempted to downplay the dependence of his case on Smirnov's testimony, and the judge delivered confusing instructions to the jury about the basis of their decision, the jury produced an equally confusing verdict: the seven defendants were guilty of Matiunin's murder, but "without premeditated intention."54 The court 50Ibid., 160-61. 5'Ibid., 162. 52Vereshchagin, Voliakisosnovskogo kraia, 80-81; Kuznetsov, "Uspekhi," 97. 53Baranov et al, Delo, 169-70; RGIA, f. 1405, op. 96, d. 5606,1. 78. This archival file of the Ministry of Justice, and two from the appeals department of the Governing Senate (RGIA, f. 1363, op. 2, d. 452, and op. 8, d. 311), are the only official ones from the case that I have found, and they have added little to my understanding of it. There appears to be nothing from the case in the Kazan archives. 54"After the evidence of these living witnesses," Raevskii said, "the experts have nothing to offer us; rather, this case gives much to science. The only thing of value in Smirnov's testimony is that among the tribes related to the Votiaks some gods aren't averse to eating human flesh." He also told'the jurors that the "motive has no signifi- cance for the determination of your verdict," which concerned only whether the accused had taken Matiunin's life. The question posed to the jury did not include the words "human sacrifice" or any reference to a religious motive. But just minutes later Raevskii urged them: "Awaiting your verdict are not only these individuals, but thousands of Votiaks, their fellow tribespeople, in order to know whether they should continue this rite. You don't want them to, and with your verdict you will not tell them that the same God who saved them from hunger and disease will [also] save them from a guilty verdict!" (Baranov et al, Delo, 174, 177-78, 193-94). The judge, for his part, advised the jurors not to worry about whether every defendant was shown to have taken part in the actual killing; since the crime was a human sacrifice (of a ritual nature and highly premeditated), any individual present could be consid- ered an active participant in it (ibid., 225-27).</page><page sequence="15">544 Robert Geraci sentenced four of them to ten years of hard labor, two to eight years of hard labor, and one to Siberian exile.55 Before the retrial, the Viatka journalists A. N. Baranov and 0. M. Zhirnov, sure of the Votiaks' innocence, had been collecting information on the case and searching for a well- known figure to bring greater public attention to it. In August 1895 they contacted Vladimir G. Korolenko, a Populist writer known for short stories written during his Siberian exile. Korolenko immediately agreed to lend his support; he petitioned the court to let him speak for the defense at Elabuga but was turned down. As an alternative strategy, Korolenko, Baranov, and the lawyer V. I. Sukhodoev decided to keep a meticulous account of the pro- ceedings so as to facilitate later discussion of the case in the event of a second conviction. The "nearly stenographic transcript" they produced was published first in the Moscow news- paper Russkie vedomosti, and later in provincial newspapers and as a book.56 Korolenko also began to publish his own commentaries on the case. These articles, Baranov recalled in his memoirs, "like a rock thrown into a stagnant swamp, made the entire press shudder."57 In the first, printed alongside the transcript, Korolenko urged that the abuses found by the Senate be corrected because "the sentence in this case will be a sentence not only on the accused Votiaks but also on the school in Multan, and on the priest who has served forty years in the church ... and on our whole cultural mission among the inorodtsy." He proclaimed, "We ... appeal for help to all the Russian press. Let the jurists evaluate the reliability of the evidence, let doctors and ethnographers analyze the surprising testimony used to accuse the Votiaks of cannibalism. ... Light, [bring] as much light as possible to this dark affair, or else horrible doubt will be forever hanging over it as to the true victims of the human sacrifice!"58 Korolenko went to Multan to speak to the Votiaks about their customs and religious beliefs. In Russkoe bogatstpo, of which he had recently become editor, he published a long attack on Smirnov denying the sufficiency of the professor's testimony to prove that a human sacrifice had been committed. The case, he pleaded, was about "not just a survival (perezhivanie) but an actual cult, still alive, and [practiced by] the entire Votiak people!"59 Smirnov's facile conflation of the two in a sense had diminished the seriousness of the supposed crime. "No, we must not close our eyes to the full horror [of cannibalistic sacri- fice], if it exists; we must not compare it with any sort of superstition! Superstitions you will find on every rung of society; cannibalism left us thousands of years ago."60 Korolenko argued that Smirnov had misinterpreted the Cheremis folktale at the center of his testimony. The story poked fun at the man who sacrificed his son. The man did not observe the normal religious rituals of his people, but was convinced by his deceitful wife that such a sacrifice was required for her to recover. Therefore, Korolenko argued, the tale is actually evidence of the obsolescence of human sacrifice among the Cheremis. The Votiaks, 55Seemingly stunned by the jury's decision, Smirnov was heard to mutter despondently, "Could my judgment really have had such an influence?" (Baranov, "Iz vospominanii," 160). 56Ibid., 154-55. 57Ibid., 161. 58Korolenko, "K otchetu o multanskom zhertvoprinoshenii," PSS4:365, 367. 59Korolenko, "Multanskoe zhertvoprinoshenie," ibid., 401. 60Ibid., 383.</page><page sequence="16">Tche Mu/tan Case, 1892-96 545 he insisted, were devout Christians, even if somewhat ignorant. If they still worshipped their native gods, they had ceased to recognize the most powerful of these, with the excep- tion of the supreme god Inmar, who accepted no blood sacrifices and was considered by ethnographers to represent the Christian view of God.61 If Matiunin's murder had in any way suggested a ritual purpose, he concluded, it was because someone had mutilated the corpse in an attempt to simulate a human sacrifice and frame the Votiaks. As a Populist, Korolenko felt that the credulousness of both officialdom and educated public opinion with regard to the supposed human sacrifice represented contempt not only toward a marginal ethnic group but also toward the entire mass of Russian peasants.62 In interviews and writings on the case, Korolenko repeatedly stressed that human sacrifice, while it might believably still exist among Siberian peoples such as the Chukchi who were far and aloof from Russians, was inconceivable among a people who had been living for centuries close to "purely Russian communities" and had themselves reached the agricul- tural stage of subsistence. Staryi Multan, Korolenko always pointed out, had had an Ortho- dox church for fifty years and a Russian school for thirty years. But even if Russian schools and missionaries had been ineffectual, the simple presence of the Russians would have to have had a significant civilizing influence on the Votiaks.63 In effect, Korolenko embraced the evolutionist faith in inevitable progress along universal lines. Strangely, he found Smirnov's own writings on the Russification of the Finnic inorodtsy to be perfectly suited to the task of supporting this optimistic worldview against Smirnov's cynical position in the Multan Case. Several self-described ethnographic experts on the Votiaks also published attacks on Smirnov's positions, his logic, and his methodology. The Irkutsk political exile and eth- nographer Dmitrii A. Klements asked why the Kazan professor had assumed that the themes of the folktales he cited were specifically Cheremis (let alone Votiak): scholars know that different peoples borrow folklore themes extensively from one another. Since many of the plots of Russian tales, for example, had been found to be of Asian origin, "there is no way of confirming for any one theme whether it is local, whether it is original or borrowed" without extensive research. Klements therefore doubted that folktales, whatever their ori- gin, can tell much about the past or the present. "To adopt a theme does not necessarily mean to absorb all the beliefs and rituals mentioned in the given story and to make a cult of them," he wrote. In any event, Klements distanced himself from Smirnov's exaggerated view of ethnography's applicability to the case: "The issue was not the formulation of a scholarly hypothesis, requiring examination, but the decision of the fate of living people!"6 6'Ibid., 396, 400. 62G.

As early as 1890, Bogaevskii had made the same point about the borrowing of folklore in a critique of Smirnov's work ("Ocherki religioznykh verovanii votiakov," 60). Another ethnographer, Nikolai Kharuzin, noticed this mistake only in 1897, after the Multan Case had been settled.

He sympathized with the "under- standable fear that any sensitive person feels for Russian culture, the fear before the pros- pect of acknowledging cannibalism in a people already living amidst Russians for hundreds of years." But even without cannibalism or human sacrifice, Klements insisted, the cultural level of the inorodtsy was nothing to boast about; the Votiaks' "pagan worldview" was still very powerful because Russians' cultural influence on them had been so weak. "We still know our inorodtsy poorly, and relate poorly to them. That is why culture is taking to them so slowly. Our ignorance and incompetence show even when we have approached them with good intentions."65 Klements at least concurred with Korolenko that the case should be a source of shame to Russians, if for a slightly different reason. Pavel N. Luppov, a school official in the Holy Synod, spoke at the Russian Geographi- cal Society and published several newspaper articles in defense of the Votiaks using logic similar to Korolenko's. Luppov's archival research showed a considerable degree of resi- dential and marital mixing between Russians and Votiaks since the 1830s (a point also made in Smirnov's monograph, he noted), which he took as proof that the Votiaks were beyond the stage at which human sacrifice might be practiced. Luppov's research also revealed no official mention of Votiak human sacrifice rituals.66 The Moscow ethnographer Petr Bogaevskii published a book-length critique of Smirnov's testimony in the case, find- ing fault with the professor's use of folklore and his assertions that the Votiaks might have tolerated deviations from their usual protocol for sacrifice rituals to sacrifice Matiunin.67 V. M. Mikhailovskii, a lecturer at Moscow University, officer in the Moscow Society for the Lovers of Natural History, and author of a book on shamanism, suggested that Smirnov had been led astray by his devotion to European theories and his pursuit of "literary polish" over empirical data in his writings. Indeed, he wrote, Smirnov could achieve only a shallow first-hand knowledge of his ethnographic subjects because his knowledge of the Finno- Ugric langauges was mediocre at best.68 Another ethnographer, Stefan K. Kuznetsov, ar- gued that Smirnov's familiarity with Votiak sacrifice rituals was only superficial. Kuznetsov, formerly secretary of Kazan University's Society for Archaeology, Ethnography, and His- tory and now librarian of Tomsk University, had been born and raised near Multan and had researched Votiak sacrifices extensively, even managing to see some of the most secretive ones.69 In a speech to the Tomsk Society of Naturalists and Physicians, Kuznetsov decried 65Klements, "Novaia stadiia." 66P.

Even in far-off Tomsk, Kuznetsov reminisced later, emotions ran so high with regard to the case that his position put him at odds with the chief of the Tomsk Education Circuit, who was such an ardent believer in the Votiaks' guilt that he "foamed at the mouth" whenever he spoke of the case.70 By the spring of 1896 printed opinion weighed heavily in defense of the Multan Votiaks. Korolenko's hypothesis of the disfiguration of Matiunin's body in poor simulation of a sacrifice gathered strong support, including that of medical experts.71 Among ethnogra- phers in Russia, Smirnov was virtually isolated in his public support of the prosecution and his assertions of the currency of Votiak human sacrifice. His responses to the various at- tacks and accusations against him only further exposed the contradictions in his own views. He seemed no longer to consider the Votiaks capable of any significant cultural evolution at all. He implied that speculation as to the current belief system of the Votiaks was irrelevant; the general "nature" or "essence" of their gods was not something historically changeable, but timeless, and discoverable by the gathering of information from various times. On the simulation hypothesis, Smirnov asserted, "For the seven men from Multan, that version of the affair is undoubtedly favorable, and their individual case, if Korolenko can prove his position, will surely be won. But the Votiaks in general, the Votiak cultural type, and the Russian cultural type-which he is defending simultaneously, will not appear at all the better: only that is simulated which takes place in reality."72 If Smirnov had ever really embraced the principal tenets of evolutionism, by now he had renounced them. Tylor's egalitarian doctrine of universal evolutionary paths notwith- standing, he evidently thought of societies on different rungs of the evolutionary ladder as different not just in circumstance but in essence. He created the impression that the past of the Votiaks had been more primitive than that of others such as the Russians, and it did not occur to him to hold the Russians responsible for their folklore as he did the Volga Finns. In effect, he had twisted evolutionism's methods so that any people he identified by survivals as relatively closer to its primitive origins than another would be judged as primitive in absolute terms. Driagin appealed the case again, not only detailing the various procedural impropri- eties that had remained from the first trial or emerged in the second but also challenging the reliability of the ethnographic references Smirnov had cited on Votiak human sacrifice. On 22 December 1895, before a large crowd, the Senate quashed the second conviction and moved the case to the Kazan Circuit Court for another retrial. This was a highly unusual event in Russian jurisprudence. Senator Anatolii F. Koni, the renowned jurist and chief 70Kuznetsov, open letter to I. N.

Through this judicial investigation not only the guilt of the individual defendants is being established; a claim is being made about an everyday phenomenon, a judgment is being pronounced on a whole nationality or a whole social stratum and a precedent is being set, which may for future time have the meaning of a judicial affirmation of the guilt of one group of the population or another. The result of the court's action in such instances is not only the resjudicata, but his- torical license for or against a particular moral evaluation of a given level of cul- ture-in a whole nationality or in certain of its classes. The grounds for [such] a verdict ... must be subjected to a much more rigorous test than the motives and facts by which a conviction is given for an ordinary murder.74 Koni implied that ethnographic generalizations had taken on a significant role in the case precisely as a substitute for particular evidence of the Votiaks' guilt, which in spite of extensive fabrication had not been produced convincingly. Koni also addressed the larger meaning he felt the case had taken on with regard to the relative prestige of different ethnic groups in Russia. Perceiving that Russian chauvin- ists saw the conviction of the Votiaks as a victory, Koni warned that from another perspec- tive the conviction raised the question "whether sufficient and appropriate measures have been taken for Russia's fulfillment, in the course of its several centuries of governing the Votiak homeland, of its Christian cultural and educational mission."75 Reportedly, Konstantin P. Pobedonostsev was especially displeased by this last com- ment (as oberprokuror of the Holy Synod, Pobedonostsev had pushed the church in a more aggressive direction in its missions to people of non-Christian religions).76 The minister of justice, M. V. Murav'ev, felt Koni had judged the misdeeds of the Sarapul court too harshly. According to one account, Pobedonostsev, Murav'ev, and perhaps other St. Petersburg au- thorities meddled in the case to prevent the verdicts from being overturned. They not only sought to protect the judicial system from losing credibility: they also found propaganda against ethnic minorities politically useful, and Murav'ev feared that the publicity resulting from an acquittal could harm his own relationship with the tsar.77 As a result, notwithstand- ing the overwhelming turn in public opinion, in the local courts the cards were again heavily stacked in favor of the prosecution. The defense asked the Kazan Circuit Court to try the case in Kazan itself, where the jurors were likely to be better educated than in the previous locations and would be farther removed from provincial rumors about the Votiaks. The trial, however, was held in the city of Mamadysh, in the far eastern edge of the province.78 The court also asked permission to have Raevskii prosecute the case once more, in light of (as it claimed) Raevskii's previous 74Quoted in Korolenko, "Reshenie Senata po multanskomu delu," PSS4:413-14. 75Quoted in S.

In light of the Senate's findings on Raevskii, even the compromise granted by the minister of justice, allowing Raevskii to assist a pros- ecutor from the circuit court, was remarkable.79 The court also hurried to dismiss the charges of police misconduct in the investigation so that the defense in the next trial could not link them with the issue of the Votiaks' guilt or innocence.80 The defense was allowed the assistance of the famous Petersburg lawyer N. P. Karabchevskii and of Korolenko. But its requests to summon a new ethnographic witness (Kuznetsov in place of Vereshchagin), new medical witnesses, and several others who could refute important details of the indictment were all turned down, even after Driagin offered to pay their expenses himself. The prosecution was permitted ten new witnesses.81 At the request of the court, Kazan newspapers were forbidden to print or reprint articles on the case prior to the trial. In the courtroom, Driagin was permitted to cite only sources not directly related to the case; anything written in favor of the defendants was banned.82 In spite of these procedural advantages, the evidence against the prosecution was over- whelming by the time of the trial, which took place from 28 May to 4 June 1896. Even without proper witnesses, the defense took full advantage of all damage done to the prosecutor's case at the previous trial and since. The prosecution desperately attempted to introduce new ethnographic evidence, which the defense easily dismissed as irrelevant.83 "The factual part of the prosecution's case," Baranov later recalled, "collapsed like a house of cards."84 In the ethnographic section of the trial, it was evident that Smirnov's opinion had only been hardened by his battles in the press. If previously he had had any reservations about the correspondence between the facts in the case and a typical Votiak human sacrifice, in the third trial, according to Baranov, Smirnov "no longer had any doubts about any- thing." He offered justifications for every possibly discrepancy. "Drawing together all the evidence from the indictment, [Smirnov] started trying to prove that all the facts of the prosecution established without a doubt that the Multan Votiaks really did offer [Matiunin] as a sacrifice." So determined was he that the judge had to remind him, "You have been summoned not as a prosecutor, but as an expert who is supposed to say what he knows about human sacrifices."85 Again, Vereshchagin's ethnographic statements for the defense were vague and unpersuasive.86 But Korolenko too had prepared an ethnographic defense. Speaking on the evolution of religious consciousness and citing Smirnov's own publications, Korolenko argued that the Votiaks had progressed considerably from crude paganism toward Christian 79Ibid., 11. 34-35. 80Ibid., 11. 28-30. 8'Ibid., 11. 38-45. 82Baranov, "Iz vospominanii," 165; Luppov, "Iz istorii," 11. 48-49; idem, "Kazanskie sudebnye uchrezhdeniia'" 11. 15-18. 83N.

"Earlier that was what I thought," Smirnov replied, "but from this case I have been convinced that human sacrifices still take place in the present day."88 Karabchevskii, in his speech to the jury, noted that the case had even altered the way Smirnov defined survivals. "From [Smirnov's] own works, I had gathered that a 'survival' (perezhivanie) is the form that remains when the spirit [of a custom] has already departed. It is like a petrified artifact, or the skeleton of an antediluvian mammoth, by which we can judge what used to be but no longer is. Now in his eyes a 'survival' is a sort of prehistoric re-eruption (otiyzhka) that emerges actually, anew, in all its flesh and blood."89 On 4 June, Korolenko made the closing speech for the defense. Admitting the evi- dence that the Votiaks had once practiced human sacrifices, he charged that by belaboring this point the prosecution was "banging on an open door": nearly every human society had practiced them, including the Russians with their tale of the cannibal Baba-laga.90 In con- clusion, to impress the jurors with the profound Christianity and childlike innocence of the Votiaks, Korolenko recited a Votiak prayer in Russian. His depiction of the naivete in the syncretic animist-Christian religion of the inorodtsy, and the overall pathos of his perfor- mance, must have strongly evoked Korolenko's own short story about a native Siberian, "Makar's Dream' published thirteen years earlier.91 "Korolenko's emotion kept on grow- ing," recalled Baranov. "Finally he couldn't contain it, began to cry, and left the room. Everybody was captivated, shaken." After deliberating for only fifteen minutes, the jury pronounced all seven defendants acquitted, and jubliation swept much of the courtroom.92 TWO CONSTRUCTS OF RUSSIAN ]IDENTITY Strains of the Multan Case reverberated for years in Russian public opinion. In the long run, the defendants' two convictions may well have made a stronger impression than their final acquittal. Later in 1896, Matiunin's head reportedly turned up and a Russian man confessed to the murder. He and another had framed the Votiaks because the village of Staryi Multan had refused to accept them after they had been expelled from their own vil- lage, Anyk; the murderers had hoped to get the land the Votiaks would vacate when they went to prison for the crime. This development remained largely unknown, however, and the case was not reopened.93 Though much of the educated public was convinced that the 87S. V.

"No matter where the legend about Votiak cannibalism came from," asserted the illustrated weekly Aiva, "one thing is certain: that the darkness hold- ing the Votiaks in its power creates favorable and, perhaps, understandable grounds for the development of such legends."97 In the church, fear of Votiak human sacrifice surfaced in a report to a missionary convention in Kazan in 1897, and archival records show that near the turn of the century some parishes undertook aggressively to stamp out the "pagan" tradi- tions of their non-Russian members.98 A Soviet ethnographer, writing in the 1930s, said that continuing rumors of Votiak human sacrifices in the Volga countryside even influenced the collectivization campaign there.99 For his part, Smirnov lost credibility among his fellow ethnographers, and soon aban- doned the study of the Finnic peoples and of ethnography altogether, returning to his previ- ous interests.'00 Within government institutions, however, his prestige had grown by leaps and bounds, and he was showered with honors and appointments.'0' By mobilizing to expose Smirnov's mistakes and to discredit his use of theory, Rus- sian ethnographers had managed to salvage their honor and prestige in the eyes of liberal society. They did so not as a professional group, for their field was not yet defined in such terms. Some, using particular knowledge of Votiak beliefs and rituals, directly damaged the credibility of the witnesses and therefore of the prosecution's murder scenario.

At times, they acknowledged that ethnography's place in the courtroom, if indeed it had any at all, was very limited. Since we do not know exactly which evidence or arguments in the case were the piv- otal ones determining its course, and since furthermore we are interested not only in the case's legal outcome but also in its various contemporary interpretations, no one account of the "essence" of the case is sufficient. From one perspective, it was a power struggle be- tween subjective prejudices and objective evidence, and between corruption and fairness in judicial procedures. But it was also a contest between different subjective beliefs and preju- dices. Because the available sources from the case show rather convincingly that the men from Staryi Multan had not murdered Matiunin, and that their two convictions were miscar- riages of justice, it is easy to overlook the ways in which the Votiaks' defenders relied no less than their accusers on tendentious beliefs and leaps of faith. Both sides of the case, albeit to an unequal extent, misused the authority of anthropo- logical science by exaggerating its ability to corroborate or refute the accusations against the Votiaks. Smirnov claimed that a survival of a practice in folklore was incontrovertible proof of its objective and continued existence, neglecting that even this would not suffice logically to settle the particular case at hand. Perhaps because of Smirnov's impressive credentials and authoritative performance in court, the defense had no choice but to wield the power of science in its own way, insinuating that a proper interpretation of evolutionism proved that the Votiaks could not have committed a human sacrifice. 102 The possibility that this logic was a tactical choice of the defense rather than a sincere belief, of course, does not diminish its importance to the case. Similarly, both sides relied on subjective notions about Russians as a collectivity. To much of the ethnic Russian public and officialdom (and perhaps other nationalities too), the appeal of a ritual murder trial, in addition to deflecting attention from political dissent and social unrest, was to buttress national pride by underscoring the supposed barbarity of a neighboring people. In more general terms, having an empire meant having other peoples at one's disposal to identify as consistently inferior to the Russians. The prestige of Rus- sians and others was a zero-sum economy; to reproach and punish the other was to exalt the self. For this purpose the Multan accusations were timely, following a famine that ravaged much of the heartland's peasantry and raised the question whether the vulnerability of the Russian people themselves was an indicator of backwardness or primitivity. An alternative construct of the empire was one in which the prestige of the Russians was in symbiosis rather than competition with images of minorities such as the Votiaks, stressing the Russians' role as benefactors in the improvement of colonized peoples. This 102Though Korolenko mostly insinuated that this was true, one of the key ethnographers commenting on the case, Petr M. Bogaevskii, stated it explicitly. Challenging Smirnov's use of the concept of survivals, he used equally problematic reasoning: "The presence of 'survivals' (perezhivaniia) of a known ritual ... serves as the best indicator that the ritual itself has disappeared from life and that its continued existence must be considered an impossible anachronism." In effect, Bogaevskii reasoned that everything appearing in folklore is by definition a survival and is therefore outdated (Multanskoe "molenie," 1-2, 101).</page><page sequence="24">The Multan Case, 1892-96 553 civilizing mission was an overarching theme of much of Russian historiography and eth- nography in the late nineteenth century (including Smirnov's). To many Russians, presumably, this historical role and the pride associated with it were defining elements of national identity. Just as apples would not fall far from a tree, it was thought, the fate of inorodtsy exposed for decades and centuries to Russian influence would reflect the merits or shortcomings of the Russians themselves. In part, this was how defenders of the Votiaks such as Korolenko and Koni sought to turn the tide of public opinion in the Multan Case. We will never know, of course, how pivotal this argument was, but we can plausibly speculate that it was more strategic than heartfelt. The defense wanted to make the Votiaks' conviction appear contrary to Russians' self-interest in order to undercut the way in which Russian chauvinists were letting their pride get in the way of a fair appraisal of the case. Again, this disingenuousness simply underscores the de- fense's plausible belief that public opinion and jurors' votes could be swayed by such rhetoric. One of the most ironic aspects of the case was that, in refuting the prosecution's assumptions about both the relevance of ethnography and the way in which the case reflected on Russians as a people, the defense relied heavily on the previously stated ideas of a key witness for the prosecution, Smirnov. No doubt Smirnov's ethno- graphic thinking between 1890 and 1896 and his behavior in the case reflect an unusual personality. He seems to have contained the entirety of the Multan Case in his own head-not only was he responsible for key lines of argument for both the prosecution and defense, but even the receptivity to such a case in local officialdom and public opinion might be attributable to his own influence. It is fascinating to speculate whether the case would have arisen at all had Smirnov never taken up ethnography. In any event, the unfolding of the case suggests that his confusion encapsulated a conflict of values that had already been present in Russian society. And there was a certain logic to this confusion. After all, the different notions of Russian identity underlying the prosecution and defense shared the sense that the inorodtsy could not simply be; in one way or another they had to serve the prestige of the empire's dominant nationality. For Smirnov, the choice between the two manifested itself as wavering between different interpretations of evolutionist terminology and contrasting descriptions of the Votiaks. Smirnov had thought that the process of civilizing and Russifying the Finnic minorities of the Volga would be completed in a matter of several decades, and in effect those inferior peoples would cease to exist. But his intuition may have told him that retrospective pride in the cultural transfiguration of the primitive would never equal the gratification of having the primitives still at hand for easy compari- son. In Western Europe, evolutionism's threat to traditional values and beliefs lay principally in its claims about the past. Even if essential cultural difference was in a sense an illusion (as the evolutionists implied), at least the British and French could choose to maintain that illusion by disregarding their own primitive past and remaining in relative isolation from the peoples they deemed still to be primitive. In the Russian empire, however, with different ethnic groups cohabitating and mixing to a much greater extent than in other European countries and their colonies, evolutionist anthropology posed the</page><page sequence="25">554 Robert Geraci additional threat of predicting an unfamiliarfuture order.103 Smirnov's misinterpretation and misuse of evolutionism's ideas and methods, and his consignment of the Votiaks to perpetual savagery, then, were his ways of reassuring Russians that they would always be special. 1031t is this difference in imperial circumstances that I see as most important in causing the particular distortions of evolutionism in the case. I am not suggesting that Smirnov's misuse of evolutionism was a result of Russia's reputed scientific "backwardness." As mentioned earlier, some key concepts in evolutionism were flawed or ambiguous from the outset, and English anthropologists were as guilty as Smirnov of twisting the theory so as to drain it of its universalist intentions and to victimize "uncivilized" peoples. See, for instance, Stocking's discus- sion of evolutionism's conceptual role in the extinction-of the Tasmanians in Victorian, 274-83.</page></plain_text>
