<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prague and Olomouc Bohumil Kubi'ta 1884-1918 Deriving from plans first made in the late 1970s and largely adhering to the interpret- ation found in Mahulena Ne'lehovi's re- cently re-issued monograph of 1984, the Bohumil Kubista retrospective (with 90 oils and 80 works on paper, dating from 1904 to 1918) at the Narodni Galerie, Prague' offered an account of its subject that, for the artist's many Czech admirers, may well have seemed reassuringly familiar. Less than a decade ago the matter would have ended there; but the delay imposed upon the project, and the cultural and political transformations occurring in the interim, ensured that this particular exhi- bition was to be among the first of its type to prove intellectually accessible to a wider, international audience, and in particular to the growing number of European and American scholars with a serious interest in early Modernism in central Europe. From discussion generated by the recent travel- ling exhibitions on the subject of Czech Modernism, and in particular Czech Cubism,2 a more contradictory image of Kubista is beginning to emerge. The 1993 retrospective, in its inclusiveness, its alter- nating arrangement of works in looser and tighter groupings, and the insights it offered through both juxtaposition and overview, will have deepened, if also challenged, the new international interest. This, in turn, may prompt revisions among those sharing in a long-established local affection. 590</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 77. Self portrait in an Inverness cloak, by Bohumil Kubi'ta. 1908. 91 by 65 cm. (Galerie Vytarneho Umeni, Zlin; exh. NArodni Galerie, Prague). 78. Quarry at Branik, by Bohumil Kubi'ta. 1910-11. 86.5 by 101 cm. (Narodni Galerie, Prague). Like many of his contemporaries gradu- ating from the art academies of Austria- Hungary around the year 1905, Kubista derived some of the momentum of his early development from a desire to shake off all traces of association with the local artistic establishment. In his view, this older gen- eration had become complacently faithful to the once revolutionary, but long tamed, impressionistic or decorative imperatives of the 1880s and 1890s. As is revealed by the uncompromising green 'mask' of the Self-portrait in an Inverness cloak of 1908 (Fig.77), Kubista's early work is not only striking in its boldness but also exceptional in its maturity. This and other self-portraits of the period 1905-08 are testimony to the recent and contemporary foreign models to whom many young artists in central Europe were now turning - Van Gogh and Gauguin, the French Fauves and the Nor- wegian Munch (who exhibited in Prague in 1905). They also reflect the obsessive self-scrutiny and self-dramatisation that were to prove distinguishing features of Kubista's weuvre, culminating in the 'mar- tyred artist' of his St Sebastian of 1912. After the disheartening critical failure in 1907 and 1908 of the Prague exhibitions of the group Osma (The Eight), in which Kubista had joined with progressive con- temporaries such as Emil Filla and Antonin Prochaizka, his career entered a calmer, more reflective phase, signalled by increas- ing absorption in studies of 'scientific' as- pects of art, most notably colour theory, and his first publications as a critic. Both activities were to be pursued during the two visits to Paris that Kubi'ta was able to make at this period (April to June 1909 and December 1909 to June 1910). A com- pelling demonstration of his mastery of colour is to be found in The cafi (1910), a gently ironic commentary on modern ur- ban society, where sequential chromatic contrast achieves an effect that is almost 'musical'. (It was, indeed in terms of Kubista's colour - famously resistant to adequate reproduction - that the exhibition proved most revelatory). In 1910 Kubista published one of his most eloquent critical essays, a response to the Cezanne exhibition at Bernheim-Jeune in January of that year, which was also a celebration of those aspects of Cezanne's work that Kubista sought to emulate. In many of the strongest paintings executed after his return to Prague, a num- ber of Parisian influences are combined. Cezanne's figural compositions, along with classical sculpture and works by Poussin studied by Kubista in the Louvre, inform the large Bathers of 1911, shown at the Cologne Sonderbund the following year. In his treatment of a local landscape sub- ject, Quarry at Branik of 1910-11 (Fig.78), Kubista draws on lessons in the work of both Cezanne and Picasso to evolve a com- position at once 'heroic' and analytical. From late 1911 the positive foreign criti- cal reception of Kubista's work, especially of his landscapes, rendered more frustrat- ing the persistent indifference or hostility he encountered at home. A distressing un- certainty, therefore, nagged him during the third (and, in effect, final) phase of his career, lasting until early 1913, after which he served in the Austrian army, in Istria, and painted only sporadically. Apart from the adoption of devices from Italian Futur- ism, found in paintings such as Train in the mountains (1912), the work of this period is less striking stylistically than thematically. An unshakeable preoccupation with death was acknowledged in paintings as diverse as the sombre, 'anthropomorphic' Still life with vases, one of Kubi'ta's most assured works, and the chilling, Dostoevskian Double (both 1911). Absorption in the metaphys- ical drew Kubi'ta to address more earnestly the subject of the artist's vocation, both in a number of smaller, austerely toned and partially 'fractured' still lifes and interiors, such as The studio of 1912, and in an essay of the same year (reprinted in the cata- logue) defining the modern artist's task as that of penetrating material reality to reveal its spiritual core. Kubista made very few significant sales - a notable exception being the Pierrot of 1911, bought by the Czech collector and scholar, Vincenc Kramai - and most of his work remained unsold for decades after his death. The 1993 exhibition was able to draw extensively on Czech public col- lections largely amassed after 1945; but the current central European vogue for 'restitution' suggests that future attempts to mount a comparably complete Kubista retrospective may be in vain. The likely difficulties are already presaged in the only major omission from this exhibition, that of the much-loved Motif from Old Prague (1911), until recently in the collection of the Ndrodni Galerie.
