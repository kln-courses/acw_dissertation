NELSON Branch of Pacific Marine Geology United States Geological Survey Menlo Park, California 94025 P. J. LAMOTHE Branch of Geochemistry United States Geological Survey Menlo Park, California 94025 ABSTRACT: The Tinto and Odiel rivers drain 100 km from the Rio Tinto sulphide mining district, and join at a 20-km long estuary entering the Atlantic Ocean. A reconnaissance study of heavy metal anomalies in channel sand and overbank mud of the river and estuary by semi-quantitative emission dc-arc spectrographic analysis shows the following upstream to downstream ranges in ppm (gg g-1): As 3,000 to &lt;200, Cd 30 to &lt;0.1, Cu 1,500 to 10, Pb 2,000 to &lt; 10, Sb 300 to &lt; 150, and Zn 3,000 to &lt;200. Organic-rich (1.3-2.6% total organic carbon, TOC), sandy- silty overbank clay has been analyzed to represent suspended load materials. The high content of heavy metals in the overbank clay throughout the river and estuary systems indicates the importance of suspended sediment transport for dispersing heavy metals from natural erosion and anthropogenic mining activities of the sulfide deposit. The organic-poor (0.21-0.37% TOC) river bed sand has been analyzed to represent bedload transport of naturally- occurring sulfide minerals. The sand has high concentrations of metals upstream but these decrease an order of magnitude in the lower estuary. Although heavy metal contamination of estuary mouth beach sand has been diluted to background levels, estuary mud exhibits increased contamination apparently related to finer grain size, higher organic carbon content, precipitation of river-borne dissolved solids, and input of anthropogenic heavy metals from industrial sources. The contaminated estuary mud disperses to the inner shelf mud belt and offshore suspended sediment, which exhibit metal anomalies from natural erosion and mining of upstream Rio Tinto sulphide lode sources (Pb, Cu, Zn) and industrial activities within the estuary (Fe, Cr, Ti). Because heavy metal contamination of Tinto-Odiel river sediment reaches or exceeds the highest levels encountered in other river sediments of Spain and Europe, a detailed analysis of metals in water and suspended sediment throughout the system, and epidemiological analysis of heavy metal effects in humans is appropriate. Introduction The Rio Tinto and Rio Odiel in southwestern Spain drain the region of the world's oldest con- tinuously operating mine (Fig. 1) (Wilson 1981). The world's largest sulphide deposit is in this area and results in natural river waters that are the color of red wine, and hence the Phoenicians, named one river the tinto, the Spanish word for red wine (Poss 1978; Schermerhorn 1982). These deposits were extensively mined by the Romans, part of the time underJulius Caesar (Wilson 1981). The Tinto mine reportedly funded Caesar's army for his later conquests in Gaul and Britain, supported his as- cendance into power in Rome and backed the cur- rency system for the Roman Empire (Poss 1978). The Tinto and Odiel rivers, about 100 km in length, enter the Atlantic Ocean through the Tin- to Estuary, where the world's largest processing plant for Australian magnitite black sand is located (Fig. 2). This plant introduces a number of an- ? 1993 Estuarine Research Federation 496 thropogenic heavy metals into the estuary to join the other anthropogenic contaminants and natural metal enrichment of the Tinto mine drainage. Be- cause of the contaminant sources and simple drain- age system, this is an ideal location to study the dispersal of heavy metals. Our purpose is to determine the types of heavy metal contaminants, trace their dispersal from the sulfide deposit origin, and note the influence of other heavy metal sources from the black sand pro- cessing plant in the Tinto estuary. The metal dis- persal in river bed sand and overbank suspension mud into estuary and offshore marine mud is traced. Also investigated are the effect of organic carbon content and grain size on the downstream dispersal patterns to define partitioning of the sediment transport. With these methods, the downstream dilution of contaminants and some anthropogenic effects can be outlined. From these metal dispersal patterns, we can define the important locations and 0160-8347/93/03A0496-16$01.50/0</page><page sequence="2">Heavy Metal Anomalies, Tinto River, Spain 497 Fig. 1.

Impact of Geologic Setting, Mining, and - Estuary Industry on River Chemistry The Rio Tinto mining district lies in the eastern end of the Iberian Pyrite Belt that extends for about 230 km northwest of Sevilla into Portugal (Fig. 1) (Williams etal. 1975; Schermerhorn 1982). This mineral belt occurs at the southern margin of the Spanish Meseta geomorphic province, which changes southward to Tertiary coastal plain de- posits (Williams 1942). The mineralized region oc- curs in Carboniferous-age marine basin deposits with felsic pyroclastic sulfide beds that were de- posited in an intraplate setting, perhaps a rift zone (Burke and Sawkins 1977; Schermerhorn 1982). The Rio Tinto is the largest of many separate local sulfide bodies in the Pyrite Belt. It was orig- inally a pyrite sheet measuring 4.5 km by 1.5 km and up to 80 m thick. Because of folding and ero- sion, much of the sulfide deposits' initial 500-750 million tons of ore was removed (Williams et al. 1975; Schermerhorn 1982). Prior to mining activ- ities it contained at least 170 million tons of ore, and it still contains 55 million tons of reserves (Bad- ham 1982; Schermerhorn 1982). The average heavy metal composition of the ore body is 0.7% copper, 2.9% zinc, 1.1% lead, and 0.6% arsenic (Schermerhorn 1982). In the region of the Rio Tinto ore body and the upper half of the Tinto and Odiel river drainages, the Spanish Meseta southern margin is highly dis- sected by small, mature, and entrenched river drainage systems (Fig. 1). The lower half of the rivers cross the flat coastal plain. The Rio Tinto drainage area is 1,676 km2 and, with precipitation averaging 69 cm yr-1, the annual discharge aver- ages 1,153,100 m3 (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980). The Odiel drainage area has a similar size, and dis-</page><page sequence="3">498 C. H. Nelson and P. J. Lamothe Fig. 2.

Both rivers nearly cease flowing in the dry summer season. The two rivers join midway in the long (20 km), narrow (3 km) Tinto Estuary (Figs. 1 and 2). This macrotidal estuary contains large mudflat regions that extend about 10 km upriver from the junction of the two rivers and includes sampling stations as far upstream as 86-RT-1 (i.e., 86-RT 1-3 and 88-RO 14-16 are all within the estuary) (Fig. 2). The sulfide mineralization of the river drain- ages, the discharge of industrial acid processing wastes at the Tinto mine, and the influx of marine waters in the estuary result in extreme variation in the river water chemistry (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1979, 1980). In a short segment of the Rio Tinto upstream from the Tinto mine sites, the river pH is neutral (7.2); from the mine to the estuary, the pH is 2.5-2.8; the pH returns to 6.2 in the estuary (Table 1) (Garcia Vargas et al., 1980). The con- ductivity in the river upstream of the mine is 0.5 mS cm-'; it increases to 7.8-10 mS cm-~ down- stream from the mining region, becomes 22 mS cm-1 in the upper estuary region of samples 86- RT-la and b, and reaches 49 mS cm-~ in the lower estuary (Fig. 2) (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980). Sus- pended sediment quantities in the river range from 0.5-0.6 g 1-~ upstream to 1.3 g 1-~ downstream, and in the estuary drop to 0.2 g 1-1 (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980). Garcia-Vargas et al. (1980) determined total dissolved solids (TDS) by obtaining the weight (following fluid evaporation) of the filtered sample as described in Rodier (1976), and found that TDS reach a maximum of 30 g 1-1 in the upper river below the mines, drop to 16-18 g 1- 'downstream in the lower river, and increase to 39 g 1-1 in the estuary. A second source for heavy metal contamination in the Tinto estuary is from a large processing plant that is located at the junction point of the two rivers (Fig. 2). This plant extracts metals such as Ti, Co, and Cr from imported black beach sand. The sed- iment waste from this processing plant is loaded on ships, transported to the middle of the Gulf of Cadiz, and dumped over the continental slope where the Mediterranean Undercurrent advects the contaminants southwestward into the deep At- lantic away from the continental margin (Pa- lanques et al. 1989). Consequently, the metal anomalies of the black sand suite that are detected in the inner shelf suspended and bottom sediments (Table 1) (Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana 1974; Palanques et al. 1989) appear to result from exchange of these metals from industrially-con- taminated estuary sediment with inner shelf sedi- ment. The inner shelf bottom sediment distribu- tion is patchy with a mixture of shoreface sand bodies, carbonate-rich muds in bathymetric lows, and bedrock exposed in some bathymetric high zones (Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana 1974). Methods Field sampling was restricted to a simple recon- naissance study of the Tinto and Odiel bottom sed- iments without suspended sediment and water analysis. In July 1986 and August 1988, 28 bottom sediment channel samples (30 x 3 cm) were taken from the headwaters of the Tinto and Odiel rivers to the ocean beaches. At each accessible site, river channel sand was sampled to represent bedload transport, and river overbank mud was sampled to</page><page sequence="4">Heavy Metal Anomalies, Tinto River, Spain 499 TABLE 1.

Splits of these samples were made for grain size, organic carbon, and heavy metal analyses. Grain size anal- yses were conducted with the SEDIGRAPH 500D (&lt;50 Aum) and by sieving (&gt;50 ,m) (Giro and Mal- donado 1985). Each air-dried bulk sample was ground to -100 mesh and homogenized prior to splitting for chem- ical analysis of heavy metals and organic carbon. Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined using a Carlo Erba model 1 106 CHN analyzer on aliquots previously treated with 0.2 N HC1 for carbonate elimination. The major and trace element data shown in Tables 2, parts A and B were obtained using direct-current (dc) arc emission spectrogra- phy (Golightly et al. 1987). The concentrations of all elements are reported in ppm (,ug g-') unless otherwise noted. The United States Geological Survey standard reference material GXR-6 was used as a quality control check sample because it contains element abundances similar to samples contained in this study. The consensus values for GXR-6 (Govindaraju 1989) (see present in Table 2) and our blind determined values (see found in Ta- ble 2) for this standard are listed in Table 2. Because of the semi-quantitative nature of dc arc spectrographic procedures, relative difference in element concentrations of ?50% are not statisti- cally significant. The data in Table 2 for the stan- dard GXR-6 demonstrate that the analytical biases of this technique for our samples are considerably lower than this stated uncertainty, except for Zn, whose concentration in the GXR-6 standard is near the detection limit. For additional verification of the accuracy of our methods, various analyses for different channel sand and estuary mud samples of the same grain size at the same general sampling site were compared (Table 3). Despite the low pre- cision of dc arc spectrography, different sampling methods, and local variation in sampling sites, there is fairly good agreement between the acid-extract- able heavy element concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectrometry for the samples of Stenner and Nickless (1975) and Garcia-Vargas et al. (1979, 1980) and the total heavy element con- centrations determined by dc arc emission spec- trography for our new samples (Table 3). The most important aspect of these previous and present sample comparisons is that the patterns of anom- alies are the same; estuary muds exhibit the highest metal values and river bank mud metal contents are greater than channel sand contents. Results SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS The textural characteristics of river bed sedi- ment from the channel change gradually down- stream, from gravelly medium sand to medium sand; upon reaching the estuary, they rapidly de- crease to fine sand (Fig. 3 right).

Only mud was an- alyzed for heavy metal content in previous inner shelf bottom sediment samples (Instituto Geolo- gico y Minero de Espana 1974) used for compar- ison with our river and estuary samples (Figs. 4- 6). All river channel sand beds contain 0.6% or less total organic carbon (TOC) (Figs. 7A, B). The TOC content of river bank mud is much greater than that of river bed sand (1.3-2.3%), and reaches 2.6% in the estuary mud (Fig. 7B) (Table 2 part B). DISTRIBUTION OF HEAVY METALS Significant anomalies of sulfide-derived heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Sb, and Cd) that exceed typical background concentrations by as much as an order-of-magnitude or more are found in the Tinto and Odiel rivers and estuarine system (Table 2). To evaluate the significance of these anomalies, comparative background concentrations for these metals in river and estuarine sand and mud are provided by the nearby Guadiana River system (Fig. 2) (Table 2). Copper, lead, and zinc concentrations in Guadiana estuarine mud (see 86RG-3 in Table 2) are in the maximum range of typical background values for these elements (Cu = 100, Pb = 200, and Zn = 300 ppm) (Levinson 1974; Forstner 1983). Guadiana sand values (86RG 1 and 2) and the Tinto lower estuary beach values (86RT-3) for copper, lead, and zinc are in the minimum range of typical background values for these same elements (Cu = 20-50, Pb = 10-20, and Zn = 50-100 ppm) (Table 2) (Levinson 1974; Forstner 1983). The typical background values quoted for reference from Lev- inson (1974) are based on worldwide shale and soil samples and those from Forstner (1983) are based on averages of shale, fossil freshwater sediment, and uncontaminated, recent freshwater sediment samples. Because the typical background metal concentrations in Levinson (1974) have a broader maximum range and include all the elements of our study, these background values have been add- ed as a reference to the legend of each map in Figs. 4-6. Anomalies of the main heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and As) associated with the Rio Tinto sulfide de- posits can be traced throughout the Tinto and Odiel river drainages, into the estuary, and offshore with- in the inner shelf mud (Figs. 4-6). The upstream to downstream trends in these anomalies, however, vary with sediment type, river system, and different elements. With the exception of a few samples in the middle section of the Tinto River, at any lo- cation, for any heavy metal, the overbank mud consistently contains an equal or greater content of heavy metals than the channel sand. Also, the anomalous heavy metal contents in muds continue further downstream and into offshore fine-grained bottom and suspended sediment of the continental shelf (Figs. 4-6). In contrast, no metal anomalies are found in sand deposits by the time lower es- tuary beach sand is reached (see RT-3 in Fig. 2) (Fig. 8) (Table 2). In channel sand, the most consistent downstream trend to lower sulfide metal anomalies occurs in the Tinto River (Fig. 8). Downstream trends are more erratic in the Odiel River sand and, except for copper, the highest metal contents are found in mid-river and even upper estuary locations. In overbank mud, heavy metal contents remain anomalously high throughout the system of both rivers (Fig. 9). In the Tinto River, however, con- centrations of some metals in mid-river locations are lower than they are at upstream or downstream</page><page sequence="7">502 C. H. Nelson and P. J.

All metals exhibit background values in ov- erbank mud at one salt marsh location in the mid- dle of the Odiel River estuary (see 88RO-16 in Table 2) (Fig. 2). In overbank mud, copper content exhibits the most consistent downstream trends and has its maximum anomalous values of 800-1,500 ppm in the headwaters area near the sulfide deposits (Figs. 8 and 9). Copper decreases downstream to mini- mum anomalies of 200-700 ppm in mid-river mud and increases downstream again to 1,000-1,500 ppm in estuary and offshore mud as compared to typical background values of 50-100 ppm (Fig. 4) (Levinson 1974; Forstner 1983). In contrast, lead and arsenic maximum values of 2,000-3,000 ppm occur in mid-drainage areas, drop downstream, and then reach equally high anomalies in the lower estuary mud compared to typical background val- ues of 20-200 ppm for lead and 50-100 for arsenic (Fig. 9). Previous studies show that in the near- shore marine deposits, lead has only a local anom- aly near the estuary mouth and no values were obtained for arsenic offshore (Fig. 5) (Instituto Geologico y Minero y Espana 1974). Low anomalies of 3 ppm for cadmium, only slightly above background values of 0.2-1 ppm, were detected in river bed sand near the sulfide deposits, whereas mud anomalies were ten times higher near the headwaters and continued into the estuary at concentrations up to 7 ppm (Fig. 6). Anomalous values of 150-300 ppm antimony, compared to typical background values of 1-5 ppm, were found in both river bed sand and overbank mud throughout the river drainages, but anomalies were not detected in estuary sediment (Fig. 6). With all the sulphide associated elements ex- amined in this study, there is a correlation of fine- grained overbank deposits, high organic carbon content, and high content of heavy metals (Figs. 7 and 9). As a consequence, river bank mud at each site generally has a significantly greater content of any metal than its companion river bed sand sam- ple, anomalous heavy metal contents of mud con- tinue into estuarine and nearshore marine envi- ronments, and the finer grain size plus higher organic carbon content of estuary mud compared to nearby river overbank mud results in an increase in heavy metal content. In the Odiel estuary north bank mud that is clos- est to the black sand processing plant, values for apparent black sand derivative elements of Cr, Zr, and Ni are two to three times higher than those</page><page sequence="8">Heavy Metal Anomalies, Tinto River, Spain 503 Fig. 4.

The elements Ga, La, Sc, and V, exhibit similar low anomalies for each of these apparent black-sand-related elements (Table 2). Anomalies for two of these elements, La and Sc, are also de- tected at nearby station 88 RO 14, and La is de- tected at only these two stations and no other Tinto or Odiel river sites. Previous studies (Instituto Geo- logico y Minero de Espana 1974) show that tita- nium, another element associated with black sand, has a local anomaly near the estuary mouth that is ten times greater than typical background values (Fig. 6). Discussion HEAVY METAL DISPERSAL PROCESSES Three primary sources (i.e., prior to secondary chemical interactions) are apparent for the heavy metal anomalies that have been detected in the Tinto and Odiel rivers and estuary. Erosion of the naturally-occurring sulfide lode deposits of the Ibe- rian Pyrite Belt has provided a significant source of heavy metals for millions of years. Extensive mining activities in the sulfide deposits have intro- duced additional erosional products and acid mine wastes from anthropogenic sources for thousands of years (Poss 1978; Wilson 1981). Processing of imported black sand at industrial sites in the Tinto estuary have input another suite of anthropogenic heavy metal contaminates for the past few tens of years (Palanques et al. 1989). With the present data set, it is difficult to distin- guish natural enrichment and anthropogenic in- puts from these sources and to trace their parti- tioning into water and sediment transport. For example in estuarine mud, what portion of the overbank mud anomalies can be attributed to en- richment from natural erosion and what portion is introduced by contamination from anthropo- genic sources of mining-induced erosion, acid mine wastes, and black sand processing wastes? With the exception of the definite anthropomorphic metal source of the black sand, this report can outline mainly the total contamination effects of all natural and anthropogenic sulfide mineral sources, its dis- tribution, and dispersal processes. The distribution of heavy metal anomalies in the Tinto River channel sand may give an estimate of the natural erosion enrichment and bedload sand</page><page sequence="9">504 C. H. Nelson and P. J.

The Tinto drainage with the world's largest sulfide lode deposit at its headwaters, has no other significant sulfide deposit sources along its middle and lower drainage (Fig. 2) (Williams et al. 1975; Schermer- horn 1982). As a result there is a consistent down- stream decrease in the content of the main sulfide heavy metals in the river channel sand and a rapid drop in values in the estuary (Fig. 8). The decrease with downstream transport appears to take place mainly because of the increasing sediment dilution of the particulate mineral sulfide grains at greater distance from the lode source in the river head- waters, similar to that of other natural lode sources (e.g., gold, cassitterite and cinnabar) (Nelson 1970, 1971; Nelson and Hopkins 1972; Nelson et al. 1975, 1977). Mixing of Tinto-based metals from river channel sand with marine sand causes significant dilution within a short distance in the upper estuary so that background levels of heavy metals are reg- istered by the time estuary beach sand deposits are reached near the coastline (Fig. 8). The heavy metal dispersal pattern in channel sand of the Odiel River is more complex than that in the Tinto River. At the Odiel headwater site a dam traps sediment plus acid mine wastes from ore processing plants, and downstream in the mid-river area there are numerous significant sulfide mine sites (Fig. 2). Apparently as a result of sand-sized sulfide mineral grains trapping upstream, the con- centration of most sulfide heavy metals in the Odiel channel sand is low in the headwater area (Fig. 8). Metal anomalies are generally less throughout the Odiel drainage compared to those in the Tinto River because total lode mineral sources and min- ing activities probably are less in the Odiel drainage (Schermerhorn 1982). Metal values are high in the Odiel mid-river area because numerous mine sources have access to the river drainage. Although high anomalies occur in the upper Odiel estuary, mixing of river sand with marine sand results in background levels of sulfide metal in beaches at the lower estuary mouth after the Odiel and Tinto rivers have joined (Fig. 8). The high content of heavy metals found in muds throughout the Odiel and Tinto rivers and estuary suggests that the suspended sediment load contains high concentrations of heavy metals. These metals deposit in overbank and estuary mud in addition to dispersing into offshore suspended sediment and 0 20 40 km</page><page sequence="10">Heavy Metal Anomalies Tinto River, Spain 505 0 20 40km Fig. 6.

Copper and zinc in the Tinto River mud and copper in the Odiel mud, similar to heavy metal concentrations in sand, have a pattern of downstream decrease in metal content that may be related to sediment di- lution (Figs. 8 and 9). The mid-river decreases in these heavy metal concentrations are significantly less in the Odiel mud, again probably because of mid-river sulfide mine sources (Fig. 2). For the same apparent reason, other elements in river bank mud, such as As and Pb, have their maximum con- centrations midway in the drainage (Fig. 8).

The presence of the finest mud and highest organic carbon contents in the lower estuary and typical association of higher metal content with these parameters, in part, may explain the higher heavy metal values there compared to lower river values (Figs. 3 and 7).

The behavior of dissolved Fe with changes in the pH of the water in the river and estuary suggests another process that may contribute significant sul- fide heavy metal content into estuarine mud. The concentration of dissolved iron in the Tinto River water drops from several thousand parts per mil- lion in river water to undetectable amounts in mid- estuary water (Table 1) (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1979). This loss of dissolved Fe correlates with the dra- matic change in pH from 2.5 in the lower river to 6.2 in the upper estuary (Table 1) (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980). As iron-rich solids precipitate as a result of this rapid pH increase and a high quantity of particulate matter is introduced by estuarine circulation in the upper estuary (Garcia-Vargus et al. 1980), the dissolved Cu, Zn, and perhaps some As plus Pb from the acid river water may adsorb onto precipitates and particles that deposit in the estuary. The process of Cu and Zn adsorption onto amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides has been observed in other rivers with acid mine drainage (Johnson 1986) and may help cause the increase of Cu and Zn in the Tinto estuary mud. The elevated dissolved content of copper and zinc in river water compared to near background concentrations for lead and arsenic (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980), and their resultant downstream dis- tribution trends in mud help to substantiate the aforementioned interpretation. Elevated dissolved copper and zinc concentrations are shown by a precipitated crust of a river bank evaporation pond at sample site 88RO 7. The crust contained max- imum concentrations of sediment-associated cop- per and zinc but background amounts of lead and arsenic (Table 2B). Adsorption of copper and zinc, elevated in the water column, could contribute to the high copper and zinc concentrations associated with the estuarine mud. This also may explain why the amount of copper and zinc in estuarine mud is similar to that in mud of headwater source areas (Fig. 9). In contrast, less soluble lead and arsenic exhibit concentrations in estuarine mud that are significantly lower than their content in muds of the Tinto headwater and Odiel mid-river source areas. Previous studies by Garcia-Vargas et al. (1980) of the general distribution of dissolved trace metals in the Tinto River water show the same dispersal and dilution trends of heavy metals in water as in the river bottom sediment. The amounts of cop- per, lead, and zinc decrease consistently down- stream in the river water both in winter conditions of high water flow and summer conditions of low water flow (Table 1). All upstream to downstream concentrations are significantly greater during low water discharge in the summer compared to the winter high runoff season, which results in greater dilution of heavy metal contaminants. These seasonal changes in runoff also effect the heavy metal concentration of the river sediment load, and result in a significant subsurface variation in heavy metal values of the river bank mud (Table 3) (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1979). Higher heavy metal concentrations observed in surface sediment may result because of the sediment samples were col- lected during the time of low water flow in the summer when there is a greater concentration of heavy metals in water and mud (Tables 1 and 3). Generally, lower heavy metal content encountered in deeper and coarser-grained sediment (Garcia- Vargas et al. 1979) may occur because the coarser sediment was deposited during high water flow conditions while metal-rich fines advected to de- position sites downstream and offshore. The de- position of less fine-grained sediment in overbank mud during higher discharge thus lowers the sur- face volume ratios and organic carbon contents to cause lower heavy metal content per unit sediment mass. Additionally, decreased dissolved heavy met- al concentrations during high flow conditions re- sulting from dilution would shift surface equilibria toward lower metal adsorption. The anomalous dissolved heavy metal concen- trations of Atlantic marine water (van Geen et al. 1991) and the high metal content of suspended sediment (Palanques et al. 1989) and inner shelf mud (Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana 1974) show that some of the metals from the Tinto and Odiel source disperse to the mid-shelf marine en- vironment through transport of dissolved solids and suspended sediment from the estuary (Figs. 4- 6). Anomalous contents of copper and lead that are two to three times the typical contents in sus- pended sediment of mid-shelf surface and near- bottom water (Table 1) (Palanques et al. 1989) con- firm this sediment dispersal pathway. Enrichment of copper, cadmium, and zinc reaching more than two orders of magnitude in Gulf of Cadiz shelf water east of the Tinto estuary (van Geen et al. 1991) relative to offshore waters also suggests that the Tinto-Odiel sulfide source ultimately feeds this metal plume in the eastward flowing Atlantic shelf water. It is unclear at this time whether water anomalies result from estuarine circulation or from diagenesis and reworking of metal-enriched shelf mud (van Geen et al. 1991). Our analyses and previous studies show that a second nonsulfide source of heavy metal contam- ination can be traced from the black sand pro- cessing plant in the Tinto estuary to the mid-shelf marine environment. Anomalies of Cr, Ga, La, Ni,</page><page sequence="13">508 C. H. Nelson and P. J. Lamothe Sc, V, and Zr in estuarine mud (Samples 88RO 14 and 16, Table 2B), two to three times above back- ground concentrations, apparently are derived from a plant with documented discharges of Cr, Fe, Ti (Palanques et al. 1989). The titanium anom- alies are an order of magnitude above typical back- ground values in the inner shelf mud (Instituto Geologico y Minereo de Espana 1974). The anom- alies of Co, Cr, Mn, and Fe in suspended sediment of the continental shelf also are two to three times above background concentrations (Table 1) (Pa- lanques et al. 1989). These elevated metal contents indicate that the processing plant inputs of heavy metals into the Tinto estuary are transported and dispersed to the shelf in the same manner as Tinto sulfide heavy metals (Figs. 4-6). COMPARISON WITH OTHER CONTAMINATED RIVER SYSTEMS Sediment from the Odiel and Tinto river systems is highly contaminated compared to sediment from other river and estuarine systems discharging into the Gulf of Cadiz. The estuary mud, estuary beach sand, Atlantic coast beach sand, and shelf sus- pended sediment associated with the Guadiana River are uncontaminated with heavy metals even though the upstream Guadiana contains extremely high levels of mercury in sediment of its tributaries that drain the Almaden cinnabar mining district (Figs. 4-9) (Tables 1, 3, and 4) (Hildebrand et al. 1980). Apparently the extensive distance from these mercury sources to the coast, and the numerous dams that trap sediment along the river, prevent the contamination from reaching the sediments of the lower Guadiana River. Sediments from the Cadiz Estuary to the east of the Tinto Estuary ex- hibit low-level contamination of lead, zinc, and cad- mium that reach more than three times back- ground values (Table 4) (Gomez Parra et al. 1984). Lead anomalies in estuarine mud near highways appear to result from automobile pollution, and anomalies of lead, cadmium, and zinc seem to be associated with shipyards (Gomez Parra et al. 1984). The extensive suite and high concentration of both naturally-enriched and industrial heavy metal contaminants of the Tinto-Odiel river system is ummatched by Spanish Mediterranean river sources. Contamination levels of some heavy met- als in the estuary and shelf sediment near the in- dustrialized areas of Barcelona and Tarragona, however, approach those in sediment of the Tinto- Odiel system. Lead and cadmium content in the sediment for about 10 km along the coast near the Besos River sewage outfall of Barcelona reach lev- els similar to the Tinto estuary and shelf sediment (Table 4) (Palanques and Diaz 1990). Again these metal contents may be related to heavy automobile pollution and surface water drainage from the streets of Barcelona. The automobile source, ex- tensive heavy industry, and petroleum refining near Tarragona result in suspended sediment anomalies of 20-50 times background for most of the toxic heavy metals (Table 4) (Palanques et al. 1990). Most of these Tarragona contamination levels, however, remain below those of the Tinto system that reach 50 to 100 times background for the sulfide source contaminants of copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic (Tables 2 and 4). The natural and industrial heavy metal contam- ination in sediments of the Tinto-Odiel systems is greater than that in most parts of northern Eu- ropean rivers that drain mineralized areas and regions of heavy industry. The average content of heavy metals in sediment of the main German riv- ers (Rhine, Danube, and Elbe) is less than a quarter of that found in the Tinto system (Table 4) (For- stner and Wittman 1981). In sediments from local (several km) mine waste and industrial sites in small tributaries of some northern European rivers, how- ever, extremely high heavy metal anomalies are encountered that are several times those of the Tinto system (Table 4) (Forstner and Wittman 1981; Forstner 1983). ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS Heavy metal contamination of sulfide-source el- ements (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Cd) throughout the entire length of the Tinto and Odiel river and estuarine system exceeds contamination found in any other presently sampled system in Spain, and reaches lev- els that may be dangerous to human health. Aston and Thornton (1977) have shown a relationship in which heavy metal concentrations above certain thresholds in sediment predict when heavy metal content in water will exceed the highest desirable level (HDL of the World Health Organization) for drinking water quality. These sediment concentra- tions are 1,000 ppm, 500 ppm, 2,000 ppm, and 5- 10 ppm for Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd respectively, all of which are exceeded by several times in the Tinto- Odiel sediment (Figs. 8 and 9). Comparison of the water content of copper, lead, and zinc in the Tinto River (Garcia-Vargas et al. 1980) with the HDL values shows that the HDL are exceeded one half to several orders of magnitude for Cu, Pb, and Zn (Table 1). We are not aware whether these rivers are utilized as a drinking water source for humans, but they definitely serve as a water source for live- stock that provide dairy products and meat for human consumption. Arsenic occurs at extremely high levels in the Tinto-Odiel system and may be especially toxic, but there are few comparable data to assess the health hazard (Figs. 8 and 9).

The high concentrations of arsenic throughout the Tinto system, compared even to sewage sludge, suggest that there may be a severe contamination problem (Table 4). The natural enrichment and anthropogenic con- tamination of heavy metals derived from the Tin- to-Odiel source should be present within the entire depositional sequences of fluvial, estuarine, and continental shelf mud throughout historic (thousands of years) and geologic (millions of years) time. This should be expected in this region be- cause three-fourths of the world's largest known sulfide deposit has been removed by natural ero- sion prior to human exploitation, and the mine has the longest continual mining history known. Con- sequently, associated biological food chains in any of these environments may be contaminated. For this reason, epidemiological studies are recom- mended in the human population, especially in the coastal plain setting of the lower rivers where wide floodplains exist and sheep and goats have grazed for centuries. Heavy metals may have entered hu- man food sources in dangerous amounts for many generations and may have resulted in increased incidences of heavy metal-related diseases, devel- opmental abnormalities, and infant mortality. Because of the potential incorporation of heavy metals into the downstream and offshore fishery resources, the dispersal of the entire sulfide and industrial-source heavy metal suite also should be completely traced in water, suspended sediment, inner shelf mud deposits, and associated fisheries. For example, arsenic content has not been mea- sured in any of these environments and the heavy metal content of suspended sediment has only been analyzed in one associated offshore station. Conclusions Sulfide lode deposits and mines result in signif- icant contamination by sulfide-associated heavy metals (As, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Sb) in the Tinto-Odiel rivers and estuary. Bedload sand contaminants are diluted downstream and reach background levels in the beaches of the lower estuary. Consistent downstream decreases are found in heavy metal content of the Tinto River sand but not the Odiel River sand because numerous mid-river mines pro- vide additional sources in the Odiel drainage. Com- pared to river channel sand, heavy metal content in suspended load and overbank mud is higher, dilutes less downstream, increases to high concen- trations in the estuary (apparently because of high TOC, fine grain size, disolved metal adsorption), and disperses more distally to suspended sediment and bottom mud of the continental shelf. A suite of metals (Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, La, Mn, Ni, Sc, V, Ti, and Zr) associated with industrial contamination of a black sand processing plant in the Tinto estuary also can be detected in estuary mud and traced to mid-shelf suspended sediment and bottom mud. Heavy metal contamination from the Tinto-Odiel sulfide source reaches the highest levels in fluvial, estuarine, and associated offshore sediment that have been encountered to date in Spain, and they exceed the worst contamination of these heavy metals found in the other main European river systems draining mineralized and industrial areas. Our data and other previous data suggest that there has been extensive contamination throughout Tin- to and Odiel fluvial, estuarine, and associated off- shore mud deposits over historic and geologic time. Consequently, a thorough analysis of all heavy met- al elements in water, suspended sediment, bottom sediment, and biological assemblages of the on- shore and offshore Tinto-Odiel system are rec- ommended. Epidemiological studies also are sug- gested for heavy metal effects in the human population inhabiting the lower drainage basin and those who use basin produce or the inner shelf fisheries as a food resource.
