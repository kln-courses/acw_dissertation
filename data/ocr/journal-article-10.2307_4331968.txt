Springer 2005 DOI 10. 1007/s10739-005-0552-1 The Bee Battles: Karl von Frisch, Adrian Wenner and the Honey Bee Dance Language Controversy* TANIA MUNZ History of Science Princeton University 129 Dickinson Hall Princeton, NJ 08544 USA E-mail: tmunz@princeton.edu Abstract. In 1967, American biologist Adrian Wenner (1928-) launched an extensive challenge to Karl von Frisch's (1886-1982) theory that bees communicate to each other the direction and distance of food sources by a symbolic dance language. Wenner and various collaborators argued that bees locate foods solely by odors. Although the dis- pute had largely run its course by 1973 - von Frisch was awarded a Nobel Prize, while Wenner withdrew from active bee research - it offers us a rare window into mid- twentieth century discussions about animals, language, and cognition. Historians, sociologists, and scientists have commented on the debate and its outcome, but none has seriously questioned why von Frisch and Wenner pursued such different explanations of the bees' dances. In this paper, I explore von Frisch and Wenner's differing visions of animals and their behaviors and show how these contributed to their respective posi- tions. Von Frisch's early-twentieth-century training in experimental physiology dis- posed him to focus on individual animals, their abilities, and their behaviors' evolutionary significance. Wenner, by contrast, was trained in mathematics and statis- tics and the Schneirla school of behavior. He viewed the bees' behaviors probabilisti- cally with an eye toward the entire hive and its surroundings and ultimately explained them in terms of simple stimulus-response conditioning. Finally, while the debate was resolved in von Frisch's favor, he neither waged nor won the battle by himself. Instead, I show that practitioners, whose agendas ranged from the nascent fields of sociobiology to cognitive ethology, took up the cause of the communicating bees.

Through a series of experiments that spanned several decades, he showed that bees indi- cate the distance and direction of food sources by two kinds of dances: a round and a tail-waggle dance. Those bees that foraged at nearby sites round danced for hive mates, while bees returning from more distant sources ran waggle dances in the shape of figure-eights. Von Frisch determined that the frequency of turns in the waggle dances varied inversely with the distance of foods and that the straight portions of the dances indicated their direction. He also discovered that bees detect polarized light and oriented their dances and foraging flights with respect to the sun. These discoveries earned him wide attention and acclaim.2 But now, two American scientists - Adrian Wenner and his graduate student, Dennis Johnson - published side-by-side pieces in Science that challenged some of von Frisch's most fundamental claims.3 While they granted that the bee dances may contain information about the distance and direction of food sources, they rejected von Frisch's assertion that outgoing bees actually used this information to locate such supplies. Instead, they argued that more rigorously controlled experiments showed odor alone to be responsible for bee recruitment. Thus, the opening shot was fired in the battle over the bee dances. A series of exchanges followed, largely in the pages of Science, between Karl von Frisch and Adrian Wenner and his collaborators.4 But by 1973, Wenner had all but withdrawn from bee studies, citing a climate that had turned hostile to his contributions.5 The same year, von Frisch was selected by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm to share the Nobel Prize in 1I am grateful to Anthony Grafton, for pointing this out in his oral commentary on a presentation of this work.

It seemed, this time the aged Goliath had slain his pesky David.7 Much was at stake in the debate over the bee dances. Before von Frisch retired in acclaim and Wenner faded from the scene of active bee research, the dispute stirred up some of the most contentious issues facing animal behavior studies. Language had long been con- sidered a window into human minds and souls, and many continued to view it as one of the most significant distinctions between humans and animals.8 The stakes were particularly high in the post-war period, as psychology, linguistics, and animal behavior studies took their cognitive turns.9 The period saw a flurry of activity: interdisciplinary study groups, edited volumes, and conferences all aimed to tackle the problem of animal communication.10 Honeybees held a prominent place in this research. During the 1960s their language was the most widely studied form of animal communication and some deemed it the most complex, second only to human speech." Not surprising, onlookers watched the debate over the bee language with considerable interest. Primatologist Stuart Altman declared it "one of the few 6 Lindsten, 1992, pp. 71-73. 7 In 1967, when Wenner's first Science article appeared, von Frisch was already 81 years old.

Wilson, and the cognitive ethologist Donald Griffin - embraced the dance language hypothesis and helped the bee to take its place alongside primates, dolphins, and birds in the mid- century pantheon of communicating beasts.13 The contours of this debate are known well enough. Historians and sociologists of science have offered various explanations for its course and outcome. The most tireless supporter of Wenner's position has been Wenner himself. In a book-length exposition, Anatomy of a Contro- versy, he argues with his former scientific collaborator, Patrick Wells, that opponents were too enamored with the dance language paradigm to give him a fair hearing.'4 Others, including sociologist of science Connie Veldink, have followed this lead.'5 While they have done much to identify the social forces surrounding the debate, they assume that Wenner was correct and have focused their efforts on explaining how he was wronged. "Nature," Veldink writes, "was with Wenner, but he remained isolated, never accumulating the necessary credibility to gain allies powerful enough to advance his case."'16 None of these accounts has seriously questioned why von Frisch and Wenner pursued such different explanations of the bee dances.'7 Although von Frisch and Wenner seemed to meet in the pages of Science, where their aims and methods appeared roughly comparable, their visions of animals and their behaviors differed radically. When von Frisch looked into the hive, he saw an animal capable of the most marvelous feat - symbolic com- munication. In contrast, Adrian Wenner saw bees as simple, stimulus- response organisms. Eileen Crist, in her recent piece on the bee language, comes perhaps closest to showing that views about animals and their abilities significantly informed scientists' attitudes toward the 12 The quote continues: "It turns on the design of experiments and the nature of evidence and deserves close attention by all students of animal behavior because, however it is resolved, the standards of acceptable evidence for any putative social signal will be improved."

Moreover, her account elides the historical developments that underlay scientists' attitudes toward the bee dances. Here I hope to show that von Frisch and Wenner's positions developed gradually over decades of research. While von Frisch had already begun using the concept of bee communication in the 1920s, he had a very different explanation of the bee dances then than he would later adopt. What is more, well before Wenner became the dance language's arch critic, he too was a supporter of von Frisch's theory. Indeed, his early works, including his disserta- tion project, were designed to explore aspects of the dance language. I begin this paper with an in-depth discussion of Karl von Frisch's background in physiology and his intellectual development as a bee and fish researcher. Sensory physiology and evolutionary concerns contin- ued to undergird his work, and his approach consistently focused on the behavior of individual animals rather than the group. In the second part, I examine Adrian Wenner's attitude toward animals and their behaviors. Here I show how his training in mathematics and electronics and his focus on populations and their surroundings, rather than on individual animals, contributed to his ultimate rejection of the language interpretation. By probing their respective backgrounds and ap- proaches, I show why the bees talked to von Frisch but only danced for Wenner. In a final part, I examine the compromise that eventually settled the debate and how von Frisch neither waged nor won the battle by himself. Indeed, the controversy is important precisely because it provided a focal point for a broad range of methods and agendas, ranging from E.O. Wilson's sociobiology to Donald Griffin's cognitive ethology. Why the Bees Talked to Von Frisch ... In 1905, Karl von Frisch entered the University of Vienna medical school. Although his heart was in zoology, his physician father had convinced him that medicine could ensure a more certain future. Despite his misgivings, he acquired a firm grounding in anatomy, zoology, and histology and worked closely with his uncle, the renowned 18 She writes, "the controversy was not about the adequacy of empirical evidence for the dance - which turned out to be 'beyond reasonable doubt' for the majority of scientists involved. It was a battle about received assumptions regarding insect capac- ities, and a willingness or unwillingness to abandon those assumptions in the face of a phenomenon that profoundly undermined them."

Hertwig had studied at Jena, during the joint and heady reign of Ernst Haeckel and Carl Gegenbaur. The two provided students with a rich mix of anatomy, zoology, and evolution and Richard and his brother Oscar were two of their most promising disciples.2' Von Frisch was deeply marked by the approaches of Exner and Hertwig; sensory physiology, evolutionary biology, and a close study of individual ani- mals remained central to his approach. Though von Frisch is best known for his work on honeybees, his activities with the insects were largely confined to summer months, when bees actively forage for food. During the winters he worked on fish. Although this work never captured the public's imagination the way his "talking bees" did, an examination of it offers candid insight into his style and attitude towards animals. In a 1923 paper, "A Catfish that Comes When Summoned by Whistling (Ein Zwergwels der kommt wenn man ihm pfeift)," von Frisch examined whether catfish could hear sound, even though they lack a cochlea - the snail-like structure that propagates sound in the mam- malian inner ear. By the time von Frisch weighed in on the question, a dispute was in full swing, with the catfish swimming center stage. At least six scientists claimed that catfish reacted to sound. Just as many found them impervious to their "whistling and screaming ... singing and clapping" and even to the "the scales and trills of a celebrated singer."22 Von Frisch argued that previous researchers had not managed to settle the question definitively, because they had failed to expose the laboratory fish to the types of sounds, which were likely to have played a role in the animals' evolutionary history. Just because a fish remained unmoved by a diva's arias, did not mean it could not hear them and von Frisch suspected that its apparent philistinism might be overcome with food. In his autobiography, he remembered thinking: "If I were a cat- fish, I would be interested in earth worms and other such tasty bites, but hardly in the trills of a celebrated singer. One cannot expect a fish to 19 Von Frisch, 1973 [1957], chapter 1; Burkhardt, 1990, pp. 312-320.

But maybe one could arouse its musical interests by applying the training method that has already proven highly effective in answering other questions."23 For his experiment with the catfish, von Frisch first surgically removed its eyes so that it could not be cued visually. A few days later he began to train the animal; each day he whistled and then proffered a morsel of meat on the end of a stick. On the sixth day of the experiment, the animal reacted. As soon as von Frisch whistled, it jerked from its shelter and swam about, apparently in search of food. Von Frisch wasted no time and repeated the performance for Otto K6rner, a doubter of catfish hearing, who apparently sank into his chair and conceded: "[There is] no doubt. The fish comes when summoned by whistling."24 The piece offers latter-day readers an instructive glimpse into von Frisch's attitude toward his experimental animals. Its tone is informal and decidedly low-tech. Although von Frisch made use of technological tools throughout his career, he often stressed the need to keep experi- ments simple. He warned that too great a reliance on instruments could come between the experimenter and his subject and obscure nature's simple beauty. In his popular The Life of the Honeybee (Aus dem Leben der Bienen), he cautioned: "When natural science employs too sharp a lens to investigate simple things, it can happen that for all her appa- ratuses, she no longer sees nature."25 But what of the fish's missing eyes? Although von Frisch may have forgone sharp lenses to investigate nature, the same cannot be said of knives. In the otherwise playful piece, a single line lets on to the fact that von Frisch's investigation of the fish's one sense was preceded by his willful extinction of another: "To remove any objection from the outset that optical stimuli could have played a part, I had extirpated both of the animal's eyes a few days earlier."26 The event is remarkable insofar as it is treated as being utterly unremarkable. To be sure, readers of the Central Biological Newspaper (Biologisches Zentralblatt) were not likely to show queasiness in the face of such procedures, as surgical manip- ulations were common in experimental physiology. But in von Frisch's autobiography we glimpse a somewhat less disaffected scientist. In this telling, von Frisch sought to blunt the event by minimizing the eyes' importance to the animal: "A catfish has minute eyes which mean very little to him. They can easily be removed without affecting his normal 23 Von Frisch, 1973 [1957], pp. 71-72. 24 Von Frisch, 1973 [1957], pp. 71-72. 25 Von Frisch, 1927, p. v. 26 Von Frisch, 1923a, p. 443.</page><page sequence="8">542 TAN1A MUNZ way of life and this was done." By simply declaring that "this was done," von Frisch stripped the deed of its agent. As if to make amends, he hastened to assure readers that the fish was in good hands: "In order to make the aquarium comfortable for the little blind fellow, I got hold of an old hollow earthenware candlestick and knocked off its base so that it formed an open-ended tube. The fish - we called him Xaverl - at once chose it as his quarters."27 From the text, then, the scientist emerges as a caregiver who ensures the fish's quality of life in the wake of its brief but necessary trauma. Moreover, we glean von Frisch's strong connection to the animal. He cared for, studied, named, and remembered it for its personality as well as its behavior.28 Although the paper was intended as a statement about the auditory abilities of all catfish, it was based on the behavior of this one, calm "little blind fellow," Xaverl.29 The paper was an early installment of von Frisch's enduring project - to reveal the marvels of nature by focusing on individual animals and their capabilites.30 But bees are unlike most other animals, including fish. The hive was long considered a microcosm of how a well-run social polity might function, its members strictly divided into castes, selflessly working toward the common good.3' In The Life of the Honeybee, von Frisch 27 Von Frisch, 1973 [1957], p. 72. 28 Von Frisch's was not alone in studying closely and naming individual animals.

Von Frisch publicly (and with the support of Richard Hertwig) disproved von Hess's claim that fish are colorblind.

Although there surely never was a bee named Xaverl, von Frisch overcame this obstacle by developing a special bee marking system.33 By means of a brush, paint, and an extraordinarily steady hand, he painted little dots of various colors on the bees' thoracic and abdominal sections in accor- dance with a specially devised numbering system allowing him to dis- tinguish and track hundreds of bees (Figure 1). In 1917, while studying the bees' sense of color, he noticed that they continued to visit a recently emptied food dish, as if to monitor its contents. When he replenished the dish's supply, a great many bees appeared at the dish very quickly. Von Frisch conjectured that bees must somehow alert hive mates to nearby foods. In 1919, he decided to pursue the question further and made what he later called the "most fateful observation of [his] life" - he witnessed the bees' mysterious dances.34 After feeding at a nearby food dish, a forager bee made a curious round dance that seemed to incite its fellows to follow it excitedly and then fly out to the same place to feed. Al- though von Frisch felt the meaning of the dance to be close at hand, almost five decades of intermittent work on the dance language followed. In the early 1920s, von Frisch noticed that there were two kinds of dances. Those that had fed at food dishes circle danced, while those returning from natural food sources waggle danced for hive mates. In a 1923 paper, he described these findings and reasoned that the shapes of the dances indicated the types of foods the bees had visited.35 At the time, it seemed that the round dance stood for nectar (or the nectar-like sugar water he'd been feeding them), while the waggle dance meant pollen. Later he would regret this hasty conclusion and ascribe it to his 32 Von Frisch, 1966 [1927], p. 2. 33 Methods for marking bees had been devised by other scientists. See, for example, John Lubbock's 1872-1879 diary in Clark, 1998, p. 263, fn. 52. But von Frisch's system allowed him to keep track of much larger numbers of bees. Moreover, his markings made of powder paint dissolved in shellac-alcohol solution lasted longer than the tra- ditional, oil paint markings.

Von Frisch's numbering system.

Despite his faulty conclusions, some lasting features emerged in this early work. Although von Frisch would come to be remembered for his break- through discoveries of the 1940s, the notion of a bee language was also already present in this 1923 piece. Indeed, since he first observed that bees alert hive mates to profitable food sources, he seems never to have asked whether but always how the bees communicate.37 The paper was also the first venue for the later-famous bee dance diagrams. Although von Frisch stressed the mad tangle (Gewuhle) of the hive, where thou- sands of tightly packed bees move about, he distilled the dancer's movements from its chaotic surroundings. The circle dance was not yet as stylized, as it would become in later representations. But drawings of the waggle dance remained virtually unchanged. The drawing - a bee 36 Although this is the reason given by von Frisch in his Erinnerungen, he had in fact placed feeding dishes several hundred meters from the hive in his earliest experiments. Von Frisch, 1973 [1957], p. 125; for his early long-distance experiments, see von Frisch, 1923b. 37 Von Frisch was not the first to investigate insect communication. In his 1923 paper, he already cited nine other well-known authors who'd investigated bee and ant communication.

In 1944 von Frisch made a dis- covery that changed his interpretation of the bee language dramatically. Despite the National Socialist government's threats to remove him from his position at the University of Munich because of his Jewish maternal grandmother, a rare exception was made in his case. His work was deemed critical to the Reich's food supply, as a disease known as the Nosema plague threatened to devastate German bee populations. Von Frisch remained in Munich until his Institute and home were badly damaged by allied bombing raids in the summer of 1944 and then fled to his family residence in lower Austria.39 During this time, von Frisch noticed that bees that foraged nearby performed circle dances, while those that fed at more distant food sources waggle danced in the hive. By gradually moving food dishes from the hive, he could cause the bees to shift their dances from a circle to a waggle pattern. In his later recollection, he again expressed the discovery in terms of solving the language riddle. He recalls having wondered: "might the language perhaps have a word for distance after all?"40 This version of the bee language was more complex than prior versions had been. The language was now symbolic and consisted of two different words - near and far - and the speed of the waggle dance's turns indicated the distance to foods; the farther away, the more slug- gish the dances. But what does von Frisch's use of the language concept tell us of his attitude about animals and their cognitive abilities? In his published writings, he was reserved about such issues. In The Life of the Honeybee, he began the section on the "Mental Abilities of Bees" with a disclaimer: "This section will be short. For on subjects of which one knows little, one should not say much.",41 By the seventh edition, he omitted the section altogether.42 But in his private writings he was occasionally more forthcoming.

(From Karl von Frisch, Uber die Sprache der Bienen [Jena, 1923], p. 73.) Griffin, he reacted to his colleague's most recent book, The Question of Animal Awareness. Griffin had raised the possibility that scientists might soon determine experimentally that animals have consciousness. Next to Washoe the chimpanzee, who'd been taught American Sign Language, the dancing bees were his most prominent example of why such a cognitive ethology should be possible.43 Von Frisch responded, "Per- sonally I have never doubted that animals such as apes, dogs, or my bird, with whom I have been close friends for fifteen years, have con- sciousness and can to a certain extent think." But, he continued: "The difficulty here is that one cannot place oneself in the inner life of another being. And we have no idea what the physiological difference between a conscious and an unconscious action [is]."44 Thus, von Frisch did not deny that some animals might have consciousness. But he believed there were significant epistemological barriers to proving its presence scien- tifically and that the inaccessibility of its inner and outer manifestations dictated a scientific agnosticism. In the case of bees, his skepticism went further still: "I completely agree with you that the bee dances are var- iable and can be adapted to changing circumstances. But I do not believe that they are voluntary, considered behaviors. One gets the impression that they are an overwhelmingly instinctive performance." 45 Thus, for von Frisch, intelligence and consciousness were tightly linked. But the bees' dances - though "variable" and "adaptive" - were 43 For his discussion of Washoe, see Griffin, 1976, pp. 16-17.

Still, he consistently referred to bee communica- tion as a language, even in the face of criticisms. Starting in the 1 930s psychologists, linguists, sociologists, and anthropologists commented on von Frisch's work and its relevance to human language.46 Though most acknowledged that animal and human language differed significantly, none were as chafed by the juxtaposition as the Hungarian psychologist Geza Revesz. In 1953 Revesz published a pointed piece for the Psychological Review (Psychologische Rundschau), in which he attacked zoologists' inappropriate ascription of the term "language" to animal communication. He warned of the "dangerous anthropomorphism" the misnomer invited.47 Animal sounds were affective and bore no relation to their meanings.48 Moreover, their 46 For examples, see Hockett, 1958, chapter 64; Lotz, 1950, pp. 712-717; Lotz, 1951. 4 Revesz, 1953, p. 31. 48 For a discussion of affective versus social interpretations of animal vocalizations, see Hoptroff, Journal of the History of Biology 38(3): 495-533 (this issue), and Thomas, Journal of the History of Biology 38(3): 425-460 (this issue).</page><page sequence="14">548 TANIA MUNZ sudden appearance in the animal's development was fundamentally dissimilar to the gradual process of human language acquisition. For Revesz, these differences pointed to a "great danger" - to deny the uniqueness of human language was to deny human uniqueness alto- gether: "... language, as such, appears only where living beings are no longer ruled by instincts, affects and habits, but rather by intentions and goals and by the insight into the suited means [whereby language] can be realized. It is precisely this way of being, which counts as the necessary precondition of humanity and separates human life from animal existence."49 Von Frisch responded to Revesz's piece in the Psychological Review in 1953, and again in the "Preface" to his Magnum Opus Dance Lan- guage and Orientation (Tanzsprache und Orientierung).50 As in the later letter to Griffin, he emphasized that the bee dances were both mean- ingful (sinnvoll) and flexible, because they varied depending on cir- cumstances. A bee might dance to indicate foods when supplies were scarce but might not for a comparable source in times of plenty. Von Frisch also cited the work of his student, Martin Lindauer, which suggested that bees did not restrict their dances to food matters. Lin- dauer had shown that during the swarming period, when a portion of the hive split off to form a new hive, a sort of negotiation took place in the hive. Returning bees waggle danced to indicate the location and quality of potential nesting sites. Based on the dances' information, hive mates would choose and populate the site best suited to their needs. In addition, the waggle dance was used to indicate water sources and other materials necessary to the hive.51 Von Frisch argued that because the waggle dance indicated distance and direction in the same way when referring to something other than food (such as nesting sites and water), precisely the sort of relation existed between movements and their meanings, which Revesz had denied. Von Frisch also rejected the anthropomorphic label Revesz had flung his way by pointing to the discreet caveat he had placed on the term language for some 30 years - the quotation marks: "I seek to counter the misconception of [having] an anthropomorphic understanding by generally placing 'language' in quotation marks."52 These were intended to alert readers that animal and human language were not identical and to signal his own awareness of these differences.

Thus, for von Frisch, the difference between language and "language" was one of degree rather than kind. Von Frisch's early training in physiology made him an intent student of animals' sensory abilities and from fish to bees, his efforts focused on individual animals. Despite his shifting interpretations of the dances' meanings, he remained committed to the concept of a bee language from the late 1910s on. Quotation marks around the term signified the phenomenon's in-between status - though not at the level of human speech, he believed it to be uniquely sophisticated among non-human animals. The bees' alleged abilities to communicate symbolically and their elevated status among animals would prove unacceptable to Wenner. But by the time he attacked the theory, von Frisch already had a near-five-decade investment in the concept and term and a career-long commitment to revealing the marvelous adaptations of nature through animals. ... But Only Danced for Wenner Adrian Wenner began his career believing in the bee dance language. In the 1940s, while stationed with the U.S. Navy in California as an electronics technician, he spent time with his beekeeper uncles, Clarence and Leo. Under their guidance, Wenner learned the ins and outs of commercial bee keeping.54 He recalled also having been "indoctrinated" into the dance language theory during this time. Beekeepers, he argued, accepted von Frisch's theory uncritically because of their fondness for the animals: "Anything that would raise the status of their charges would have a warm reception among [them].",55 53 Von Frisch, 1953, p. 236. 54 Wenner's "grandfather and four uncles, as well as several brothers and cousins, kept bees during the past several decades." According to his 1993 retirement announcement, this "intensive work with uncles Clarence and Leo [Wenner] provided valuable practical background for his later research on bees." Anonymous, 1993, p. 237. 55 Wenner, personal email correspondence, July 10, 2003.</page><page sequence="16">550 TANIA MUNZ After his stint in the Navy, Wenner returned to his native Minnesota, where he enrolled at Gustavus Adolphus College to study mathematics, physics, and education. He went on to earn a master's degree in biology at Chico State University in California and then briefly pursued grad- uate work in mathematics at Oregon State.56 Although he left mathe- matics to enroll in the University of Michigan's graduate zoology program, his mathematical inclinations would remain central to his biological work. This was in marked contrast to von Frisch, who never felt comfortable with mathematics and statistics and on several occasion appealed to trusted colleagues for mathematical support.57 According to Wenner, the University of Michigan's graduate pro- gram oriented itself along mechanistic and Skinnerian lines, with stu- dents reading G.S. Fraenkel and D.L. Gunn's Orientation of Animals: Kineses, Taxes and Compass Reactions. Fraenkel and Gunn's book of- fered a reformed Loebism that sought to explain "primitive behavior reactions" of lower organisms. Its aim was to explain "the way in which the various external factors - light, smells, currents, heat, and so on - operate the living mechanisms and lead to orientation."58 Michigan's program was also aligned with the Schneirla School. Theodore Schneirla was an eloquent critic of instinct theory.59 He rejected concepts such as inborn, instinctive, and innate, because he believed they lumped together disparate behaviors and short-circuited more meaningful explanations that took the organism's entire devel- opment into account.60 Although his favored organisms, the army ants, had been declared the "ultimate instinct machines," Schneirla explained their behaviors in terms of genetics, development, and social interac- tions.61 He ascribed the queen's periodic egg laying behavior, not to an 56 Anonymous, 1993, p. 237. 57 For an interesting disagreement about the importance of statistics in biological work, see ANA 540 BI, Otto Koehler, February 11, 1948; ANA 540 BIT, Otto Koehler, February 3, 1948; February 20, 1948.

For a discussion of Jacques Loeb and his influence, see Pauly, 1987. 59 Schneirla and his student, Daniel Lehrman, were also trenchant critics of Konrad Lorenz's ethology (and politics). In 1953, Lehrman accused Lorenz of anthropomor- phism, grossly generalizing across species, and ascribing inappropriately complex behaviors to lower animals. Although there were significant differences between von Frisch's approach and Lorenzian ethology, Schneirla and Lehrman's critiques resonated with von Frisch's critics. Lehrman, 1953, pp. 337-363.

According to the theory, different animals' seemingly similar behaviors are often due to very different underlying factors. For example, he cautioned that while feeding in cats and jel- lyfish seems comparable (in that they serve food uptake, are instinctive, and species-typical), they ought not to be seen as being on par with each other; their developmental histories and underlying psychological bases are qualitatively distinct and ought to be recognized as such. In a 1957 piece, Schneirla argued similarly against comparing bee communication with that of humans and other higher mammals: The "waggle dance" as described for the honeybee by von Frisch is an efficient communicative device and an impressive event, but when considered in the light of its stereotyped ontogenetic basis, it must be viewed - contrary to a frequent conclusion from general similarity - as fundamentally inferior in its qualitative organization to symbolic processes in higher mammals and language in man. The appearance of behavioral stereotypy through ontogeny, if found characteristic of a species, indicates a lower psychological level, whereas a systematic plasticity in the organization of behavioral cues made broadly representative through experience indicates a high level.64 During his graduate studies at Michigan, Wenner resumed his interest in bees. His Navy electronics training proved useful, as he applied newly available sound technologies to analyze the bees' various buzzing sounds.65 For his dissertation work, he set up dishes with sugar syrup at different locations and recorded the bees' sounds with a spectrograph that plotted frequency against time.66 The technique was used widely to analyze a range of animal sounds, including those of dolphins, bats, and birds. The graphs allowed Wenner to quantify sound with respect to the bees' activities. Unlike von Frisch's classic bee dance illustrations, where 62 Schneirla, 1964 [1961], p. 564; 1971, chapter 8. 63 Schneirla, 1972 [1953], pp. 238-253. 64 Schneirla, 1957, pp. 82-83. 65 While in the Navy, Wenner learned to "operate and repair radar, radio, and sonar equipment ....

Indeed, even an intent examination of it does not yield readily the creature responsible for its creation (Figure 4). Wenner concluded that bee sounds correlate more closely to the distance of foods than do the times required for bees to complete their circle runs, as von Frisch had suggested. The mechanism by which bee dances might be conveyed to other bees in the darkened hive continues to puzzle bee researchers. But Wenner at the time decided on sound rather than sight.67 Although the dissertation offered an emendation to von Frisch's work, it did not constitute an essential break with the dance language theory. Wenner also began thinking about hive organization. Like others, he'd observed that bees seem to behave erratically at times. But unlike von Frisch, who ascribed this to the inflexibility of individual animals' instincts, Wenner focused on the overall order of the hive. In a 1961 Journal of Theoretical Biology piece, he suggested that "the system [the hive] is ... controlled by a Markov process."68 A Markov process is a statistical expression for a series of randomly occurring variables with respect to time, whereby a given future value (or behavior in this case) depends only on the most recent values (or behaviors).69 He wrote of the hive's suitability for such an analysis: "A honey bee colony is appro- priate for the investigation of the existence of such a process. The colony size can be regulated, environmental conditions can be fairly uniformly controlled, and individual bees can be marked and watched. A Markov matrix of probabilities can be constructed on the basis of observation; and environmental factors can then be altered one at a time and the effect on the matrix can be studied."70 The approach assumed that all behaviors were similar in kind and that transitions between them were random. But the quote's most striking aspect is Wenner's faith in the experimenter's ability to control the hive fully and unproblematically. In 1964, Wenner left Michigan for an assistant professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There he continued to work on bee communication and teamed up with Robert C. King, a researcher at Servomechanisms Inc.7 While von Frisch had argued that the dancing bee's abdomen traced a figure eight during its waggle movements, Wenner suspected that a bee was more likely to transmit information 67 Wenner, 1961b, p. 37. 68 Wenner, 1961a, p. 326. 69 Feller, 1968 [1950], p. 372. 70 Wenner, 1961a, p. 327. 71 Wenner, 1964, p. 117.</page><page sequence="19">THE BEE BATTLES 553 61 METERS 200 - 0 _ 152 METERS ,600 -3 0200 4LL0200 a. w 0 40 1M2T3E4S 19604-, p. 1 z 400- Figur 4.s Shound, spectrgrp showning aee plostiofnted waggle daneelesound' frequeincy the dances. To test the theory, Wenner and King marked the animal's thoracic segment with a white dot and used rapid-flash photography to capture its movements.72 The resulting pictures bore little resemblance to von Frisch's images; gone were the crisp and elegantly symmetrical 72 Wenner, 1964, p. 117.</page><page sequence="20">554 TANMA MUNZ figure-eights. Instead, the bee's path appeared crooked and irregular. Wenner concluded that the dances were insufficient to communicate the location of foods and again proposed that sound must provide addi- tional information. He published these findings and the waggle dance photographs in a 1964 article for Scientific American (Figure 5). In the same article, Wenner recounted experiments for which he'd recorded and played back worker bees' piping calls. He determined that the sounds helped calm the hive aftera disturbance.73 By using this method and deeming it epistemologically sound in assessing the social functions of animal calls, Wenner aligned his work with contemporary animal communication studies, as playback experiments were commonly used during the period, especially in studies of birds, primates, and dolphins.74 In the piece, Wenner treated bee communication broadly and drew connections to different species and even beings from other planets.75 He wrote that in addition to the long, invariable tooting sounds, bees produced "overtones that are varied considerably in emphasis just as they are in human speech....,76 In closing, he enthused that in "listening to the sounds of bees, recording them, analyzing them and designing experiments to explore their meaning, one cannot help feeling that much of this is akin to the problem of communicating with beings of another planet. With bees we have the advantage of being able to study them here and now."77 In his sweeping inclusion of bee, human, and alien, Wenner construed communication as a largely disembodied phenome- non not bound to any one, particular organism. During his early time at the University of California, Wenner also tried to build an artificial bee with King.78 He hoped that if an arti- ficial bee could be made to recruit real bees, they might isolate which aspects of the bees' maneuvers transmitted the critical location 7 Wenner, 1964, p. 119. 74 For a discussion of the historical development and significance of playback exper- iments in animal behavior studies, see Falls, 1992, especially pp. 17-19; Radick, 2000, pp. 3-23; 2003, pp. 175-206; Radick, Journal of the History of Biology 38(3): 461-493 (this issue); Hoptroff, Journal of the History of Biology 38(3): 495-533 (this issue).

The attempt further highlights how Wenner's approach was more removed from the physiological animals than that of von Frisch.79 But Wenner soon abandoned this work. The project was mired in technical difficulties, and in 1964 Wenner and his graduate student, Dennis Johnson, discovered that bees could be trained to visit food sites without attending dances. All that was necessary was for the bees to associate a food with a conditioned stimulus, such as odor, smoke, or the opening of their enclosure lid.80 To further test condi- tioning, they duplicated some of von Frisch's classic experiments. In 1967, Wenner and Johnson published their challenges of von Frisch's step and fan experiments (Stufen- and Facherversuche) in Science.81 Von Frisch had originally performed these experiments in 79 Although von Frisch also included an image and discussion of an artificial bee in his Dance Language and Orientation, it was a rather crude, wooden model that had been used by fellow German bee researcher, Harald Esch. Von Frisch, 1965, p. 103. For other discussions of work with artificial bees, see Haldane and Spurway, 1954, p. 260; Milne and Milne, 1962, pp. 35-36; Steche, 1957, p. 598; [Steche], 1959, p. 34; Esch, 1964, pp. 534-546; Gould, 1975b, p. 686; Griffin, 1976, pp. 92-93. 80 This findings is published in Wenner and Johnson, 1966, pp. 149-155; Johnson and Wenner, 1966, pp. 261-265. Von Frisch had already described this behavior in the early 1920s. His more recent works, however, tended to focus on the waggle dance, in which he rejected the role of odor. 81 Wenner, 1967, pp. 847-849; Johnson, 1967, pp. 844-847.</page><page sequence="22">556 TANIA MUNZ 1947 to determine the accuracy with which bees use dance informa- tion.82 For the experiments, he'd trained bees to feed at a particular feeding station. He then set up additional food dishes, either in straight lines or semi-circles for the step and fan experiments, respectively. Foragers trained to feed at the original sites returned to their hive mates and danced to indicate just one location. Von Frisch then filled all the dishes with food and counted attending bees to determine if recruits preferred the sites indicated by their fellows' dances. Wenner and Johnson modified the experiments for their Science pieces. In addition to bees trained to feed at only one site, they also trained a lighter strain of bees - distinguishable only by color, not behavior - to feed at all the other dishes of the step and circle arrange- ments. Their question was whether recruits would follow their hive mates' dances and visit only the original feeding station or whether they would be (mis)led to feed indiscriminately, or even preferentially, by bees at other sites. Counter to von Frisch's theory, they found that bees visited all stations in great numbers, despite their having had the benefit of dances about just one site. They concluded that the mere presence of feeding bees was sufficient to attract other bees to foods. Although they still granted that the bees' dances contained information about food site locations, they argued that something other than the dances had at- tracted the bees to foods and deemed odor the most likely candidate.83 In his rebuttal to the piece, von Frisch drew on a reservoir of bee work that spanned several decades.84 To prove that bees in fact used dance information rather than scents, he recounted obstacle experi- ments for which he'd trained bees to fly around a tall building or mountainside to foods.85 Upon their return, dancers indicated the true direction of the food source, not the roundabout path they themselves had flown. Bees that attended these dances flew in a "beeline," rather than the dancers' diverted paths, indicating to von Frisch that dance information, rather than scent trails, guided their searches. Von Frisch also faulted his detractors for having placed their dishes too close to the hive. Where Johnson, in his fan experiments, had set dishes no further than 270 meters from the hive, von Frisch had tested distances of up to 82 Von Frisch continued to perform variations of these experiment into the early 1 960s.

He also criticized Wenner's claim that bees' own scents guided recruits. Already in 1946 he'd rejected that their abdominal (Nasanov) glands played a role in directing bees to foods. He'd covered their glands with shellac to prevent them from releasing hive odors while feeding and found the bees' abilities to locate foods undiminished. He concluded that they must have relied on the dance language rather than scents.87 Wenner and Johnson's reply is revealing. They claimed that "[their] results do not disprove of [sic] the dance-language hypothesis." Rather, in the spirit of parsimony, they wished to "indicate that a more simple interpretation exists for previous experimental results."88 Odor could just as well account for how bees found to foods and was a simpler and, therefore, preferable explanation. They rejected von Frisch's shellac experiment and argued that the substance itself could have contributed strongly to locale odors and guided bees to foods. They also pointed to the difference in foraging success for experienced and inexperienced bees in a pitch for stimulus-response conditioning. Those bees that had al- ready visited food sites prior to leaving the hive could rapidly locate foods after hive mates carried their scents into the hive. In contrast, those bees that had never visited a food site fared more poorly. To Wenner and Johnson "the data [were] more suggestive of a probabilistic search pattern than of a goal-directed flight."89 They urged a more holistic approach that did not focus on individual animals' behaviors but instead viewed the hive as an integral part of a larger odor land- scape: "We find that the hive, its surrounding environment, and its past history are part of a dynamic system and must be studied as such."90 In 1967, Wenner struck once again at von Frisch's theory in a piece for Physiological Zodlogy.91 This time, he teamed up with his later Anatomy of a Controversy co-author Patrick Wells and James Rohlf, a statistical biologist at the University of Kansas. In the article, the au- thors performed sophisticated factor analyses on the bees' dances. They examined parameters such as sugar concentration and viscosity, time of day, and light intensity, to determine if aspects of the dance corre- sponded to the richness of food sources, as von Frisch had claimed. 86 Von Frisch et al., 1967, p. 1075. 87 Von Frisch et al., 1967, p. 1073. Wenner himself later abandoned the idea that pheromones from the Nasanov glands serve to attract other bees to food sources. 88 Von Frisch et al., 1967, p. 1077. 89 Von Frisch et al., 1967, p. 1077. 90 Von Frisch et al., 1967, p. 1077. 91 Wenner et al., 1967, pp. 317-344.</page><page sequence="24">558 TANIA MUNZ They found no significant correlation and argued that even if they had, there was no proof that other bees actually used this information, as too little was known about "the capabilities or state of the receiver."92 The paper offered no new experimental data but was laden with mathematics. The by then eighty-one-year-old von Frisch found little into which he could sink his teeth. He once again turned to his trusted mathematical advisor, the myrmecologist Rudolf Jander. For his Dance Language and Orientation, von Frisch had already relied on Jander's mathematical talents. In a letter, he lamented that one of the corrections he'd adopted from Jander made him "feel a bit like flying blind and without instruments" but he also confided that "unfortunately I can't understand [Wenner's] calculations at all."93 This time von Frisch's appeal was similarly pathetic, although his reference to "a devastating critique of the 'dance language hypothesis"' should be appreciated as a rare instance of Frischian sarcasm: "The result is a devastating critique of the 'dance language hypothesis' the justifications of which unfortu- nately remain mysterious to me because of my lack of statistical talent. Could you perhaps have a look at the work and make it understandable to me insofar as this is possible? In the non-statistical part he repeats the same rubbish he already brought in Science."94 Despite von Frisch's efforts, the bee language's purported commu- nicative function gradually crumbled before Wenner's eyes. He believed that bees could find food sources by odor alone and that von Frisch's claims did not withstand mathematical scrutiny. He began to write polemical pieces that accused von Frisch and his supporters of romanticism and a blind embrace of the exotic. To Wenner, a deep association with an organism often lead to anthropomorphic interpre- tations: "Many animals have remarkable structures and/or behavioral patterns. The discovery of yet another remarkable event among animals will find a ready acceptance in a basically optimistic audience. ... One need observe bees for only a very short period of time before becoming impressed with the many human-like actions they have. An anthropo- morphic interpretation may soon follow, even if subconsciously."95 To Wenner, the assumption that the dance's information content necessarily implied information use by other bees was hopelessly tele- ological.96 Time and again he railed against what he called an Aristo- telian or Darwinian teleology in biology. To his mind, explanations that 92 Wenner et al., 1967, p. 326. 93 ANA 540 BI, Rudolf Jander, September 11, 1963. 94 ANA 540 BI, Rudolf Jander, January 19, 1968. 95 Wenner, 1974, pp. 134-135. 96 Wenner and Wells, 1990, pp. 362-366.</page><page sequence="25">THE BEE BATTLES 559 sought to answer "why?" or "what for?" questions, hampered scientific progress and led to misleading conclusions. The approach failed to take into account that not all behaviors are adaptive nor may their purpose be inferred readily. As an example, he offered male fruit flies drawn to methyl eugenol, a laboratory-synthesized chemical. Given free access to the substance, flies will drink themselves to death. Surely such behavior was not adaptive. Similarly, he felt it illegitimate to conclude that fire- flies communicate information about ambient conditions, simply be- cause their flash rates vary with temperature.97 In the case of bees, he argued that the dance information "may well be only a symptom of what a foraging bee has experienced as it flies between hive and food place, not a signal for other bees.98 But for von Frisch, complex instincts demanded functional expla- nations. This deep-rooted commitment to evolutionary explanations marked what was perhaps the most unbridgeable difference between him and his young adversary. Wenner's admission of the bees' complex dances followed by his steadfast denial of their communicative function amounted to an incomprehensible, biological non sequitur for von Frisch. In a 1975 letter to bee researcher James Gould, he expressed his exasperation with Wenner: "What always amazes me is that he finds so many supporters in the US, even though he maintains that the direction and distance information goes unheeded by the alarmed hive mates. Especially since there are no elaborate behaviors without specific functions. How could such a differentiated dance have evolved if it had no biological significance? Apparently Wenner and his followers don't trouble themselves with this."99 Thus, what amounted to illegitimate teleology to Wenner, was binding necessity for von Frisch. Surely the bees did not dance simply for the sake of dancing. The Debate "Resolved" or How the Bees Could Talk and Dance In 1970, Science ran another piece on the bee dances by three Caltech undergraduates: James L. Gould, Michael Henerey, and Michael MacLeod.'00 The authors had modified the fan experiment to address Wenner and Johnson's challenges to von Frisch's work. In addition, they'd attempted to control for any odors that might have helped guide bees to their foods. While they granted that "under certain 97 Wenner and Wells, 1990, p. 363. 98 Emphasis in original. Wenner, http://www.beesource.com/pov/wenner/readme.htm. "IA.

Other members of his committee were Peter Marler, one of the period's foremost students of animal communication, and the myrmecologist and E. 0. Wilson-collaborator, Bert Holldobler. In 1975, Gould published "Honey Bee Recruitment: The Dance-Language Controversy" in Science.'02 He'd arranged feeding dishes in a fan and trained bees to feed at a station some distance from the array of target stations. He then painted forager bees' simple eyes (ocelli), with opaque black paint. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction in light sensitivity but did not interfere with the bees' abilities to forage and dance.'03 Once these bees returned from feeding and danced for hive mates, he shone a bright light into the hive that was visible only to dance attendees but not the ocelli-impaired dancers. Gould asked whether dance attendees would now be misled to interpret the dances with respect to the artificial "sun" or whether they would ignore the dance information altogether and forage according to the scents the ocelli- treated dancers had carried into the hive. He found that recruits were less likely to find feeding stations and overwhelmingly used dance over odor cues. He also argued that Wenner's use of highly concentrated, scented sugar solutions during the training phase, might have caused bees to dance less for their hive mates which, in turn, prompted recruits to rely more heavily on odors.104 Gould conceded that under normal circumstances, bees were more likely to use olfaction over dance information to locate foods. Still, he maintained "the dance language is a real and very significant phenomenon" and concluded that "depending upon conditions, honeybee recruits use either the dance language and odor information, or odors alone."' 05 Many in the animal behavior community welcomed Gould's work as the final word in the controversy and hailed it as the vindication of von Frisch's theory. In his 1979 history of ethology, William Thorpe summed up the debate as follows: 101 Gould et al., 1970, p. 553. 102 Gould, 1975a, b. 103 Gould, 1975b, p. 686. 104 Gould, 1975b, pp. 689-690, 692. 105 Emphasis in original. Gould, 1975b, p. 691.</page><page sequence="27">THE BEE BATTLES 561 In recent years ... there have been disbelievers who thought they had shown that the dance of the bees were not really communi- cative and that it could all be explained by conditioning to par- ticular odors in a particular environment. ... suffice it to say that recent criticism by some workers in America, particularly that of Dr. A. M. Wenner and his associates, have led to a very careful re- assessment and repetition of the key experiments ... . It is very pleasant to be able now to assert without fear of contradiction that while von Frisch may. have at times underestimated the importance of the search for odors when finding a food source, his main results have been overwhelmingly confirmed, particularly by the work of J. L. Gould who, by most ingenious experiments, has confirmed Karl's conclusions up to the hilt.106 Thorpe's assessment of the debate was not uncommon.107 When Wenner and two colleagues wrote an indignant letter to Scientific American, protesting that E.O.Wilson had made no mention of their challenge in his lengthy discussion of animal communication, Wilson replied, "I didn't mention the 'controversy' over the honey bee waggle dance because I no longer feel that the discussion of the subject even merits the word."'08 But within the same month of Wilson declaring the debate dead, biologist Demorest Davenport, in a letter to Science, agreed with Stuart Altman that the debate was "one of the few non-sterile contro- versies in the study of animal behavior."'09 The following year, Wenner was once again supported publicly in Science by Guy Ankerl and Derk Pereboom of Switzerland. They objected that there had been no mention of Wenner's challenge in 106 Thorpe, 1979, p. 65. 107 For a more in-depth discussion of Wenner's challenge and Gould's work with a similar upshot, see Manning, 1979 [1967], p. 107. Similarly, Griffin in his 1976 plea for a cognitive ethology, wrote: "their [Wenner and Well's] unwarranted skepticism has had the constructive effect of stimulating several new and improved experiments." A couple of pages later, Griffin concluded "One should not underestimate the ingenuity with which sufficiently determined skeptics can find some tortuous loophole providing for an indirect effect of odors, but the weight of evidence is now overwhelmingly in favor of von Frisch's original interpretation." Griffin, 1976, pp. 27 and 29. Ute Deichmann relegated Wenner's challenge (quite literally) to a footnote in the story about von Frisch. She writes, "an alternative hypothesis ... was a source of controversy for many years.... J.L. Gould (1976), however, gave unequivocal experimental evidence of the communi- cative meaning of the dance." Deichmann, 1996, p. 385 n. 46. 108 Wilson, 1972b, p. 6. 109 Davenport, 1974, p. 975. Although he avowed himself "studiously ... neutral in the debate," it is perhaps worth noting that he held an appointment in Wenner's depart- ment at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</page><page sequence="28">562 TANIA MUNZ Donald Griffin and Peter Marler's write-up of the 1973 Nobel Prize. Although Griffin and Marler had noted that "questions have been raised" about von Frisch's work, they dismissed these as semantic quibbles over the term "language" and bracketed them as falling out- side the biological domain: "Questions have been raised about the accuracy with which information is actually transmitted, and about the relative importance of the dances, odors, and sounds or vibrations. Philosophers and linguists may debate whether the term language is appropriate. But, for behavioral scientists, the revolutionary discovery was that an insect sometimes communicates with fellow members of a closely integrated society by flexible, iconic, graded gestures about distant objects that are urgently needed by the social group as a whole."' 1"0 Ankerl and Pereboom were especially irked by this relegation of dance language criticisms to the realm of philosophy and linguistics and stressed that von Frisch's theory had "incurred criticism from entomologists" and that "Wenner et al. [in their statistical piece] raise serious questions about the methodology and conclusions of von Frisch's school."'"" Griffin and Marler responded: "We are far from wishing to dismiss the ... contributions [of Wenner, Wells, and Rohlf], which have stimulated new and improved experiments. But on balance we agree with [E.O.] Wilson that 'the communicative function is decisively supported by experimental evidence ... st112 Griffin had been a long-time supporter of von Frisch.' 3 Nearly 30 years after their first letters, he wrote of his "deep admiration for all [his] work over many years not only on the language of the bees but the hearing of fish and so many other topics. ... My admiration (I am almost tempted to call it 'hero worship') has, as you know, been of very long standing. ""14 He also commented on the debate with Wenner and Wells: "I continue to be amazed, even outraged, at the stubborn refusal of Wenner and his colleagues to face the 'fact of life' concerning your brilliant discoveries. I hope, but with no great confidence, that [James] Gould's recent experiments will convince even them. But there seems to be an almost ideological reluctance, bound up I suspect with the strong current of behavioristic reductionism that has been so prominent among 10 Marler and Griffin, 1973, p. 464.

Griffin linked Wenner's obstinacy to his behaviorist tendencies but felt the situation was not hopeless. He sensed that behaviorism had run its course and was giving way to other approaches: "I am convinced that this [behaviorist] tide has turned, and I can assure you that despite the many foolish publications from Wenner and his colleagues, almost no one takes them very seriously... ." .15 Griffin was not alone in viewing the debate in terms of behaviorism. In a letter to his friend and colleague, Ernst Mayr, von Frisch had inquired whether Science might be ill-disposed toward him because of post-war anti-Germanism. Mayr, himself a German, reassured von Frisch that this was unlikely. At the same time, he pointed to what he considered a more probable cause for von Frisch's troubles with the journal: "1 do not think that Science can be designated as hostile to German scientists. On the other hand there are indications that several of the members of the editorial staff are extreme behaviorists and reluctant to believe in genetic programming of behavior."' 16 Von Frisch himself never emphasized the genetics underlying the bee dances and in private correspondence voiced his disapproval of what he felt to be geneticists' over-confident reach." 7 Still, the letter makes clear that von Frisch's work was seen as evidence against behaviorism and in favor of genetically determined, instinctive behaviors. Thus, the lid on the debate between von Frisch and Wenner was more or less forcibly closed, despite Wenner's efforts to the contrary. What could have been taken as a compromise between the two sides was seen by most as von Frisch's victory. To be sure, a still-warm Nobel Prize must have contributed to this perception. The casual reference to "Karl" in Thorpe's account of the debate also hints at the close personal ties and support von Frisch enjoyed on both sides of the Atlantic and Channel. Moreover, Wenner's insistence on odor and only odor hardly helped his cause. But the focus on vindication over compromise also suggests that a great deal more was at stake than simply whether bees use odor or dance information. Indeed, the debate touched on fundamental questions about the nature and capabilities of animals and how science ought to study them. Gould in his Science piece recognized as much: "Some of the resistance to the idea that honey bees possess a symbolic language seems to have arisen from a conviction that 'lower' animals, and insects in particular, are too small and phylogenetically remote to be capable of "5 ANA 540 BII, Donald Griffin, November 25, 1974. 116 ANA 540 BII, Ernst Mayr, May 25, 1967. 117 For examples, see ANA 540 BI, Heini Hediger, July 19, 1973; BI, Martin Lindauer, February. 18. 1964; May 3, 1974.</page><page sequence="30">564 TANIA MUNZ 'complex behavior."'"18 But complex behaviors were coming back into vogue during the 1960s and '70s, and many saw von Frisch's work as an important arrow in the anti-behaviorist's quiver. Conclusion Trained nearly half a century apart, on different continents, and in different specialties, Karl von Frisch and Adrian Wenner waged their battle across a considerable gulf. Von Frisch was first and foremost a physiologist who'd trained with some of the field's premier practitio- ners. Even when studying the eminently social honeybee, his gaze remained fixed on individual animals and their behaviors. From his earliest work on fishes and bees, he sought to reveal the marvels of nature by proving animals capable of more than had been previously assumed. The bees' language fit well within this project. Indeed, despite criticisms and his changing interpretations of its meaning, von Frisch remained committed to the bee language for some five decades. Although he did not consider it equal to human language, as he signaled by the quotes that consistently framed the word, he believed it superior in complexity and flexibility to other forms of animal communication. Implicit in this unwavering belief in the bees' uniqueness was perhaps an understanding that his own status as a scientist was tightly linked to that of his remarkable subjects. Although Wenner began his career as a believer in von Frisch's inter- pretation of the bee dances, his approach to animals was rather different. Where von Frisch's examinations were informed by a deeply physiolog- ical understanding of bees, Wenner's view of communication was largely disembodied. In his early work, he applied his technical and mathematical talents to quantify sounds and abstract the movements from the animals that produced them by means of sound spectroscopy and rapid-flash photography. By the mid-1960s, he began to question whether bees actually used the information contained in their fellows' dances to locate foods. As he and various colleagues became increasingly skeptical of the bee dance's communicative function, their focus shifted from individual bees to the distribution of recruits at feeding dishes. Following Theodore Schneirla's approach to army ants, Wenner saw bees as part of a larger, dynamic system, which included the hive as well as its surroundings. In keeping with Wenner's early exposure and self-professed affinity to a mechanistic approach, he ultimately ascribed the bee's ability to locate 118 Gould, 1975b, p. 692. This point is also made in Crist, 2004.</page><page sequence="31">THE BEE BATTLES 565 foods to simple odor conditioning. Much to von Frisch's dismay, Wenner granted that the bee dances contained data about food locations but rejected the communicatory conclusion as teleological. But the dispute over the bee dances was never just about whether the bees locate foods by means of a dance language or simply by reacting to odor cues. At stake were competing visions of animals and their behaviors and how science could best come to know them. Von Frisch neither fought nor won the battle by himself, as James Gould's decisive role in the debate suggests. His theory offered an interpretive flexibility that allowed it to be incorporated into a range of programs, like the sociobiological perspective of E.O. Wilson or the more cognitive turn embraced by Donald Griffin. Although Wenner himself was no simple behaviorist, Griffin and Mayr's reactions to the debate reveal that his resistance to von Frisch's theory was ascribed to precisely such ten- dencies. Indeed, von Frisch's case was picked up by a range of scientists reacting to the overly restrictive behaviorism that had dominated much of the century's American studies of behavior; as it turns out, the bees could dance to a variety of tunes.
