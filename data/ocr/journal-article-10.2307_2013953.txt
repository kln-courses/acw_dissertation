These two books represent Boutroux in the earliest and latest phases of his thought. The first is the translation of a Latin thesis submitted in 1874, along with the better known French thesis, De la Contingence des Lois de la Nature, shortly after the young student's return from Heidelberg. The second is a collection of articles on recent thinkeis in France, published during the present century, when Boutroux became a member of the Academy and a recognized authority on the history of philosophy. From first to last he was concerned with the "eternal verities" as the basis of science and religion. He conceived them, not as static, a priori truths, but as dynamic constructions in a historical development and contingent upon the free action of the will. He would have us regard history as a resurrection, not an interment of ideas. According to M. Brunschvieg, Boutroux was responsible for the revival of studies in the history of philosophy in France. A pupil of Zeller's and translator of his monumental work on Greek philos- ophy, he had encountered the reaction against Hegelian dialectic in Germany and was committed to a less abstract and formal inter- pretation of history. He wished to emphasize individual diversities, considering them, not with Zeller as accidental variations which offset one another under the dominant motives of history, but as manifestations of "a power whose action is capable of breaking, more or less definitely, the thread of historical continuity. " He felt that his teacher had rejected the form rather than the foundation of the Hegelian system. In Zeller he found "the distinctive trait of the German mind . . . which sees in the individual as such only a nega- tion and provisional form of being," while for the French spirit "individual free will is an end in itself." It was, then, in the history of ideas, as the action of creative individuals, that Boutroux sought to establish the grounds of religious and moral certainty as well as the uniform laws of science. The same voluntarism, which appears in the essay on Philosophy in France since 1867 (read before the International Congress at Heidelberg in 1908), had been formulated by Boutroux in his inter- pretation of Descartes in 1874. In his Latin thesis, he maintains that the philosophy of Descartes is centered, not in the principle of self-certainty, but in the idea of a Perfect Being, whose nature unites the abstract essences or eternal verities with the infinite possibilities of existence. The principle of this divine nature is free activity and the essences, no less than existences, are freely created; by God. Thus, the essences do not explain his activity, but his activity in- volves the essences. The same truth applies with limitations to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 687 finite wills. "It is only in the degree to which it participates in essence or understanding that power deserves the name of will; and on the other hand in the degree to which essence admits of power, that is to say, is moved by will and action, it becomes, rightly, understanding, which grasps things as not only possible but real" (p. 62). "From the consideration of God as the being in whom essence and existence are necessarily united, it clearly results for me that this existence which is affirmed in the words: 'I think, there- fore I am,' is not only objective, but effective" (p. 110). Is the divine power not only free, but arbitrary? In other words, could the Perfect Being have created a universe contrary to the meta- physical and mathematical essences? The answer is that "while he could only realize them according to his own perfection, he was not, however, at all obliged to subject them to the relative law of contra- diction" (p. 75). How "the Cartesian principles constitute some- times a duality, sometimes a unity" and how a causal reciprocity obtains between the unalterable essences of the understanding and the free activity of the will (pp. 137 ff.), is a question that remains somewhat obscure in the thesis, unless one is inclined to accept the view that there are "two kinds of contradiction: one between im- perfect things considered in themselves alone, the other between perfection and its contrary" (p. 68). In his survey of French philosophy since 1867, Boutroux is characteristically opposed to the tendencies of positivism and what he regards as the possible replacement of philosophy "by a collec- tion of philosophical sciences, that is to say, by some unities added to the list of the positive sciences. " This would amount to the com- plete abolition of philosophy. Yet beneath the growing preoccupa- tion of philosophers with special problems arising out of the physical and social sciences, he still discerns the independence of the philo- sophic impulse. i" To the sense for the general, which is the mark of the scientist, our philosophers, add or oppose the sense for the real, for the living, for fully concrete and determinate being. And, com- paring that which is with that which science explains, they never tire of indicating a hiatus between these two terms. They maintain the rights of a living and complete experience in the face of the artificial and systematized experience instituted by science. " The true function of philosophy is to conceive things from the standpoint of unity, and the principle of this unity is borrowed from human nature. "To understand is to relate to oneself. A certain anthropomorphism is thus implied in the very idea of a philosophy. Man understands things in the degree to which he rediscovers himself in them." The remainder of the Nouvelles .tudes are about various thinkers who influenced or were influenced by Boutroux during his long and</page><page sequence="4">688 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY active career: his first teacher of philosophy, Jules Lachelier; Henri Poincare, whose genius he was able to appreciate in a peculiarly intimate way; Olle-Laprune, who strove to re-establish philosophy upon the foundations of Catholic Christianity; Evellin, Fe'lix Ravaisson, and Charles Secretan. Without personal bias, each of these diversified studies displays a single vision and a persistent con- viction. Of their author it might be said (to paraphrase his own words) : Devoue a la science, il resta t'apotre de l'ideal. D. S. MACKAY. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.</page></plain_text>
