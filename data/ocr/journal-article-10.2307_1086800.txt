<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS EURIPIDE. Vandoeuvres-Geneva: Fondation Hardt (Entretiens sur l'an- tiquit6 classique 6). 1960. Pp. 290. ($6.50) THIS VOLUME is the published version of the last of the Hardt Founda- tion's annual "entretiens" to be held during the life-time of their founder, the late Baron Hardt; it forms a fitting memorial to Baron Hardt, for the seven papers and the lively discussions which follow each typify, between them, that blend of scholarship and cordial debate for which la Fondation Hardt is justly renowned. The collection contains several studies of the divine and the human or psychological motivations of Euripidean Tragedy (J. C. Kamerbeek, Andre Rivier, Albin Lesky), two studies of specific aspects of particular plays (R. P. Winnington-Ingram and Gunther Zuntz on Hippolytus and Helena, respectively) and two studies more concerned with the "environmental" aspects, physical, socio-political, and intellectual, of Euripidean tragedy (Hans Diller, V. Martin). Within the limits of a brief review, the wide range of interest of this collection must be judged by reference to but a few of its many contentious arguments. J. C. Kamerbeek, in "Mythe et Realit6 dans l'Oeuvre d'Euripide," develops the (by this time) hardly original view that Euripides was not the "myth-smasher" that Verrall and his followers thought him to be; rather, since Euripides transposed the experiences of his own life and times into the traditional frame-work of myth, his plays owe much of their spiritual vitality to the tension between those two powers, myth and reality, which reigned over his soul. Although there is much that is true in his generalizations about Euri- pides and myth, Kamerbeek seems to be at fault in failing to distinguish between the various attitudes which Euripides takes toward his mytho- logical material in different plays, and in failing to recognize that Myth and Reality are not always antithetical concepts in Euripidean drama. As a result, he is led into the fallacy (which is not new in Euripidean criticism), that Euripides, in some charming, absent-minded way which only makes him a more sensitive poet, was the victim of his conflicting attachments, so that the pursuit of one of his goddesses was constantly leading him into conflict with the other, and vice versa. If there is one thing about which the student of Euripides needs to be clear, it is that Euripides always knew exactly what he was doing in his various treat- ments of myth: if at any point his sense of reality seems mastered by the fascination which myth exerts over him, we may be sure that at that 238 PHOENIX, Vol. 18 (1964) 3.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 239 point myth, as Euripides is treating it, is expressing something ultimate about reality. Very different from Kamerbeek's discussion of myth and reality in Euripides, is Andr6 Rivier's subtle and conscientious reconsideration of what he describes as the communis opinio concerning our poet, namely, that he was the first to describe the autonomous human consciousness, untroubled by forces outside itself, and that, in so doing, he contested, directly or ironically, the idea of man's dependence on the gods. While agreeing that, throughout his work, Euripides' novel presentations "du monde de la conscience" result in a considerable shaking-up of the traditional mythological structures, Rivier argues that in the plays before 428 B.C. there was none of the ironic or of the specifically critical treat- ment of the gods to be found in the later plays. Rather, this critic believes, there are signs in the earlier plays, particularly in those commonly called "tragedies of 6p-yi or Ovy6," of at least that kind of religious feeling which Nilsson has described as a belief in an undifferentiated stream of super- natural power (an originally primitive phenomenon which, according to Nilsson, survives somewhat paradoxically even within an officially polytheistic mythology). Rivier suggests that in the plays of both Euri- pides and Sophocles in this period (before 428), the force which rules the psyche is depicted as having a subjective and an objective aspect, a human and a divine, or demonic, essence. Several excellent illustrations of this idea are given from the plays and fragments of both dramatists, though the example which Rivier regards as the most convincing (Euri- pides' Medea; see especially Rivier's novel interpretation of vv. 1056- 1080) happens to be the one which this reviewer finds to be the least helpful to his thesis. Rivier cites with approval B. Schweitzer's view that there is no contra- diction between myth and rationalism, and, indeed, that rational elements dominated the ultimate and significant form of myth in the fifth century. This may well be true, but myth at this level (whether it represents the gods "symbolically," or whether, as Rivier believes, the sense of the supernatural hiding behind the mythological figures is really the imper- sonal "stream of power" to which Nilsson refers) has become something quite different from the literal anthropomorphism of Homer. Therefore his own thesis would seem to require this critic to admit that in such passages as the "mythological frame" of the Hippolytus (where the poet exaggerates, if anything, the spiteful personalities of the goddesses con- cerned), there is implicit criticism of traditional belief. At any rate, such criticism need not be separated off as a later cleavage of the reason and of the (so-called) religious sentiment of Euripides, for it in no way contra- dicts the sort of sophisticated "mythologizing" in which Euripides</page><page sequence="3">240 PHOENIX himself indulged, not only in earlier plays such as the Hippolytus but, pace Rivier, in plays as late as the Bacchae. Professor Zuntz's major contribution to the appreciation of Euripides' Helena is his insistence, in contrast to the well-known view of Professor Kitto, that tragi-comedies can develop serious themes, and this not in an incidental manner, or as a happy accident, but as one of the effects of that ironic play between appearance and reality on which the whole tragi-comic (or "serio-comic," crrovbatoyXotos, as I would prefer to call it) genre depends. If anything, however, Professor Zuntz errs on the side of "the serious," and is occasionally seduced by his own logic into mis- interpreting an intentionally paradoxical passage. Both the strength and the weakness of his argument may, perhaps, be illustrated in parvo by reference to his treatment of "the Theonoe episode" in which Helen and Menelaus secure the all-important complicity of the Egyptian seer in their escape. Here, surely, Zuntz is right in rejecting Kitto's view that the episode is due simply to the combined motives of "good theatre" and of dramatic convenience; indeed, Zuntz is particularly convincing in his account of the noble motives and crucial nature of Theonoe's decision. However, in view of vv. 887-890, I believe that Zuntz is wrong in deriding Kitto's view that Theonoe regards herself (and, I would add, is so regarded by the poet) as in some sense an arbiter between Hera and Aphrodite. A major point in the episode seems to me to be the ironic contrast expressed between the personal and vindictive motives of the two goddesses and the altruistic basis on which the human priestess decides between her brother's and the fugitives' causes-and this decision, Theonoe has told us earlier in the scene (887-890), will be tantamount to deciding in favour of Hera or of Aphrodite. But "how" (in this case), asks Zuntz with inexorable logic, "could Theonoe thereafter so earnestly have advised her prot6g6s (1024 ff.) to pray for the good-will of these very deities" (p. 206)? Very easily, for this is part of Euripides' irony; indeed, Theonoe herself, in her piety, has already asked Aphrodite's pardon (1006-1007) for deciding the issue against her. Why was it that both Euripides and Menander seem to have had little difficulty in securing a chorus, i.e., of "getting produced," whenever they wished, and yet won first prize on relatively few occasions? M. Victor Martin, in the last of the papers collected in this volume, suggests that, in each case, the poet had the approval of a small, influential minority capable of appreciating his subtleties, but not that of the great majority of whose view the judges took heed before awarding the laurel wreath. Since this somewhat meagre comparison (at least as presented in this paper) is introduced only in the concluding pages of a lengthy paper, one wonders a little about the title "Euripide et Menandre" which M.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 241 Martin has given his piece. For the rest, this paper describes some general characteristics of Euripidean Tragedy, hazards some speculations, based mainly on the Clouds and Frogs of Aristophanes, as to the sort of culti- vated minority who liked Euripides ("Strepsiades" and "Dikaiopolis," on the other hand, are taken as typical of the predominantly country-bred majority who disliked him but approved of Sophocles), and makes some rather obvious comparisons between the Aristophanic pictures of Euri- pides and of Socrates, and of their effects on contrasting social types.
