<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Place of Architectural Speculation GEORGE DODDS, The University of the Arts This paper considers the nature of the speculative architectural project, its distinction from building, and its relationship to a particular aspect of mimetic inquiry. Moreover, this paper considers the impact that the rise of technique has had on the mimetic and suggests a conceptual model that may contribute to ameliorating this impact while enhancing the mimetic capacity of a speculative architectural project. Architectural speculation is considered through the relationship of "making" and "place," evidenced in the somewhat unlikely conjunction of Gothic Scholasticism, surrealist theater, and the cinquecento conceptual model of disegno. This paper intends to explicate their interrelationship through reconstructing a program that invites participation in the collective mimesis of the speculative architectural project. Architecture and Building Before I go any further, however, I should explain exactly whom I mean by an architect; for it is no carpenter that I would have you compare to the greatest exponents of other dis- ciplines: the carpenter is but an instrument in the hands of the architect. Him I consider the architect, who by sure and won- derful reason and method, knows both how to devise through his own mind and energy, and to realize by construction, what- ever can be most beautifully fitted out for the noble needs of man.... To do this he must have an understanding and knowledge of all the highest and most noble disciplines. This then is the architect. -Leon Battista Alberti, De Re Aedificatoria The aim and intention of all human activities and occupations governed by wisdom must be directed either to restoring the integrity of our nature or to tempering the inevitable deficien- cies to which temporal life is subject. -Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalicon LEON BATTISTA ALBERTI BEGAN HIS TREATISE, DE RE AEDIFICATORIA, BY distinguishing the activity of the architect from the activity of the arti- san, grounding architecture not in the mechanical art of construction, but in the liberal art of speculation.' Alberti identified architecture through its association with "other disciplines." Throughout the course of his treatise, Alberti took every opportunity to develop ex- plicitly that which in the Prologue he tacitly asserts-that architecture is foremost a discipline grounded on speculation. Similar to Hugh of St. Victor, Alberti seems to suggest that the intention of this specula- tion is to perfect man's transformation of one's self and of nature. In an effort to establish the grounding of architecture outside the exigencies of the mechanical arts and within the strictures of the seven liberal arts, architectural theorists and treatises, recent and distant, have shared in making the distinction between architecture and building. Consequently, it is a schema that has been variously associated with twentieth-century post-modernism and modernism, nineteenth-century romanticism, a particular aspect of the eighteenth- century French Enlightenment, and Renaissance humanism. Al- though the argument is old, its currency remains intact as theorists and practitioners search for the grounding of the discipline of archi- tecture independent of the techniques of the profession.2 Alberti supported his distinction between the utility of building and architectural speculation through the dualism of lineaments (lineamenta) and structure (materia). "All the intent and purpose of lineaments lies in finding the correct, infallible way of joining and fitting together those lines and angles which define and enclose the surfaces of the building. It is the function and duty of lineaments, then, to prescribe an appropriate place, exact number, and proper scale, and a graceful order for whole buildings and for each of their constituent parts, so that the whole form and appearance of the build- ing may depend on the lineaments alone."3 For Alberti, lineaments were not only independent of the material building, but more impor- tantly, by definition they preceded and ordered the material. Let lin- eaments be the precise and correct outline, conceived in the mind ... and perfected in the learned intellect of imagination."4 Through his philosophy, Alberti partitioned and specified the activity of architecture, describing what the architect does and how it is accomplished. Alberti's model of the discipline of architecture in- cluded an understanding of architectural intentions both in terms of the planned physical results and in terms of the intellectual value of the pursuit independent of the physical end state of building. Simi- larly, John Ruskin and Le Corbusier attempted, for their own times, to do much the same as did Alberti half a millennium earlier. In Vers un Architecture, Le Corbusier reformulated Alberti's dualistic schema of lineamenta and materia through a series of textual and photo- graphic aphorisms. Le Corbusier explained that following the compo- sition "comes the moment when [the architect] must carve the lineaments of the outward aspects. It is in his contours that we can trace the plastic artist; the engineer is effaced and the sculptor comes to life. Contours are the touchstone of the architect." He concluded, some- what disparagingly, that contours "go beyond the scope of the practi- cal man."5 Earlier in the same chapter, Le Corbusier further extended Alberti's dualism in the context of comparing architecture and con- struction. "Almost every period of architecture has been linked on to research into construction. The conclusion has often been drawn that architecture is construction. It may be that the effort put forth by ar- chitects has been mainly concentrated on the constructional problems of the time; that is not a reason for mixing different things. It is quite true that the architect should have construction ... at his finger's ends . . but he should not vegetate there."6 Le Corbusier lamented that November 1992 JAE 46/2 76</page><page sequence="2">through confusing architecture and building, "architecture is lowered to the level of its utilitarian purposes: boudoirs, W.C.'s, radiators, ferro-concrete, vaults or pointed arches, etc., etc. This is construction, this is not architecture."7 The distinction between the physical end state of building and the value of architecture as an intellectual pursuit, first discussed by Alberti, was further advanced by Ruskin, who began The Seven Lamps ofArchitecturewith the proviso, "It is very necessary, in the outset of all inquiry, to distinguish carefully between Architecture and Building. [A] building does not become architecture merely by the stability of what it erects; and it is no more architecture which raises a church, or which fits it to receive and contain with comfort a required number of persons occupied in certain religious offices, than it is architecture which makes a carriage commodious or a ship swift ... Let us, there- fore, at once confine the name [architecture] to that art which, taking up and admitting, as conditions of its working, the necessities and common uses of the building, impresses on its form certain characters venerable or beautiful, but otherwise unnecessary."8 In the exposition, "The Lamp of Sacrifice," Ruskin observed, not only is it necessary for architecture to be unnecessary, but that the very nature of the discipline of architecture runs contrary to the rise of efficiency and technique. "[Architecture] is therefore most unreasoning and enthusiastic, and perhaps best negatively defined, as the opposite of the prevalent feel- ings of modern times, which desires to produce the largest results at the least cost."9 Ruskin, writing in the midst of the rise of French and English romanticism, the movement that would become associated with the Victor Cousin epithet, "... I'artpour l'art.... " presented a definition of architecture through the negation of technique. Conse- quently, if the grounding of architecture, as Alberti, Ruskin, and Le Corbusier suggested, precedes the material, lies beyond the manipula- tion of the material, and is independent of the efficient use of the ma- terial, then it may in fact reside, as Alberti explains, "in the learned intellect of imagination," i.e., in speculation and mimesis. Mimesis and the Threshold of Architectural Speculation It clearly follows that the poet or "maker" should be the maker of plots rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he imi- tates, and what he imitates are actions. -Aristotle, Poetica Because of the discovery of fire, there arose at the beginning, concourse among men, deliberation and life in common.... Many came together into one place, having from nature this boon beyond other animals.... Hence after thus meeting to- gether, they began, some to make shelters of leaves, some to dig caves under hills, some to make of mud and wattles places for shelter, imitating the nests of swallows and their methods of building.... Since men were of an imitative and teachable na- ture, they boasted of their inventions as they daily showed their various achievements in building, and thus, exercising their tal- ents in rivalry, were rendered of better judgment daily. -Vitruvius, DeArchitectura The activity of making any thing, including the speculative, is on one level an assemblage or (re)construction of preexisting fragments into a new whole. This activity of (re)construction constitutes a kind of threshold condition. For some, this threshold leads to the realm of the mimetic-the activity of transforming nature, through imitation.'? During a discussion of drama in the Poetics, Aristotle described the different modes of mimesis, distinguishing between imitations that are heroic and those that are comic in nature." Aristotle explained that imitations of actions (mimesis of praxis) that are above the level of man's station are heroic, while those that are below are comic.'2 Northrop Frye referred to these distinctions as (heroic) high and (ironic) low mimesis.'3 Plato, however, through the course of his dia- logues, made distinctions, not of high or low, but rather of good and bad. Although Aristotle seems to have made distinctions of degree, Plato's distinction was one of kind. In the Republic, the artist, the poet, and the architect were banned from Plato's ideal city-state, but the artisan was not.14 Plato's concern, of course, was with the truthfulness of their activities and the nature of the artifacts they produced. The artisan made things that were what they were, but the artist, and by extension, the architect made things that, in addition to being what they were, were also what they were not. That is, the artist was engaged in the making of imita- tions of things-illusions of things, rather than the things themselves. Although every artifact, including works of art, has a certain inherent facticity and incumbent claim to truth, Plato argued that the primary concern of "the imitator" is one of imitation and appearance, i.e., bad mimesis. However, through the course of his dialogues, Plato also pre- sents a view of a very different kind of mimesis-not the mimesis of imitation, but of speculation. For Plato, mimesis (good mimesis) is not the mediation of nature that the Sophists would have, but rather the transformation of nature, through which man reenacts the first cre- ation, ultimately revealing Truth and Beauty.'5 This Platonic distinc- tion of good mimesis is essential to the present investigation. The virtual and the physical were equally illusory for Plato, valuable only through their transformation (mimesis), which allows us to reveal the Ideal. This "remaking" is a restoration of knowledge that 77 Dodds</page><page sequence="3">does not resemble the original so much as it leads to the essential con- dition of the referent. The understanding that is achieved comes from the consideration of not only the new state, but also the relationship of the transformed state to the referent. For in mimesis, meaning is es- tablished, not only through simulacrum, but through a lack of resem- blance as well. "It was this vision that enabled the philosopher to examine the arts of language and mathematics, painting, music, and politics, and to grasp that they imitated a common, eternal truth or beauty, and, moreover, that through the arts, man imitated the divine creative act through which soul called things into existence. Still, in all their discoveries, their growth and decay, the arts did not frame a new order. Instead, like the philosopher's mind, they pointed backward to a lost knowledge that, by mimesis, they served to restore."16 This as- pect of mimesis and its relationship to the discipline of architecture is central to this inquiry. Architectural speculation is considered here as an heuristic act, specifically as a restoration or remaking of a condition that is no longer present.'7 In their individual treatises, Alberti, Ruskin, and Le Corbusier connoted a sense of architectural speculation as a bounded activity or place, in essence, constituting a site. It is within this site or bounded place that the mimetic capacity of architecture emerges. Knowledge, a particular kind of knowledge, is achieved through this making and re- making.'8 However, to suggest that this pre-Renaissance schema re- mains intact and unaltered is to ignore the long shadow cast by the Enlightenment's rise of technique. The intent of this paper is to sug- gest, or more accurately to reintroduce, a conceptual model that may contribute to ameliorating the impact of technique while enhancing the mimetic capacity of a speculative architectural project, specifically through the relationship of "making" and "place." Technique and the Crisis of Place Our predecessors, on the other hand, considered questions of quality in their treatises; and Boullee's architecture of shadows and Palladio's search for place or locus are not merely autobiog- raphies. For it is always the idea of place, and hence light and time and imagination, that recurs in the treatise-writers as that which can modify and finally be adapted in architecture. -Aldo Rossi, A Scientific Autobiography Techne... reveals whatever does not bring itself forth.... Thus what is decisive in techne does not lie at all in making and ma- nipulating nor in the using of means, but rather in the revealing mentioned before. It is a revealing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a bringing forth.... Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. -Heidegger, "The Question Concerning Technology" The impact that the rise of technique has had on art and architecture has been and continues to be a complex and substantial issue. Al- though much of this debate lies well beyond the scope of this study, a particular aspect of technique and its relationship to architectural pro- duction is critical to this discussion of the mimetic and its place in the making of a speculative architectural project. Philosopher and social critic Jacques Ellul speculated in The Technological Society on the per- vasive effect of technique, particularly on the relationship of "making" and "knowing" and how the nature of this relationship has been sig- nificantly altered since the time of the ancients. In contradistinc- tion to contemporary understanding, the techniques of ancient or sacred people were as extensions of the body rather than distinct third elements.19 "In his conflict with matter, in his struggle to survive, man interposes an intermediary agency between himself and his environ- ment .... However, in the world of the sacred, man is related to the world directly. There is a lack of distinction of subject and object, and immediacy of relation, an experience of totality."20 Echoing Ruskin's definition of architecture through the nega- tion of technique, Ellul argued that technology, once a minor subset of science, has grown to engulf science and, by extension, all of society through such instrumentalism as efficiency and bureaucracy. This is in part what Ellul referred to as "the technological phenomenon." In sharp contrast to the Heideggarian model of technology as a way of unveiling or revealing, Ellul contended that technology, and particu- larly technique, must be measured in terms of its relative degrees of opacity. Within the technological society, the entirety of human en- deavor no longer simply employs techniques, but rather, is employed by technique.21 This distinction of the opacity of technique is of criti- cal importance when considered within the context of architectural production. For example, creating an iconic representation of a build- ing using a keyboard and software package is a significantly more opaque technique than making a drawing with a pencil in hand. In contrast to the opacity of the former, the activity of drawing would be considered a relatively transparent technique. The more opaque a technique, the less revelatory it becomes, distancing the maker from that "which is concealed from mankind" and further hindering mi- metic inquiry.22 From Ellul's perspective, the continually increasing opacity of technique has contributed to the fracturing and dissolution of our understanding of the world we make, evolving from the polar- ity of poetical (poesis) and instrumental (techne) making.23 November 1992 JAE 46/2 78</page><page sequence="4">This polarity of modernity, and by extension the dichotomy of architectural speculation, was central to Walter Benjamin's seminal essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."24 More often than not, interest in this essay, particularly within the realm of architectural theory, tends to center around the issue of au- thenticity and the aura of the original that mechanical reproduction has ostensibly served to diminish if not eradicate. However, Benjamin's influential essay is of value here primarily for its implica- tion on the issue of the crisis of place, of which the loss of aura is merely symptomatic. Benjamin explained that since its inception in the form of cut-block printing, the technique of mechanical repro- duction has not only transformed our conception of a work of art, but for the first time, has brought into question the relationship of the work of art to the place it is made "in" and "for." Benjamin's insight into the primacy of place is of special inter- est within this context. Prior to the woodcut, a work of art was con- ceived and made for a specific location within an existing architectural setting, often in situ. However, with the possibility of mechanically producing and reproducing works of art without considering the loca- tion for which they were being made or where they would be viewed, it became possible for the first time to consider a work of art as being autonomous, independent of body or building. Benjamin understood that authenticity and place are inexorably linked and have been sub- stantially altered through the introduction of mechanical reproduc- tion. "In principle a work of art has always been reproducible... Mechanical reproduction of a work of art, however, represents some- thing new.... With the woodcut, graphic art became mechanically reproducible for the first time, long before script became reproducible by print .... [Yet,] even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element; its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be."25 Clearly, authenticity is not all that is at stake in the age of the technological society. If one accepts the principle of anthropomor- phism-that we understand the world through our bodies (either as a fragment or as a whole) while we simultaneously project our bodies onto the world we inhabit-then the increasing opacity of technique would appear to be fundamentally in conflict with the tradition of mimetic inquiry. What was once a process of revealing prior to tech- nique has been devalued to the level of the vicarious. A century earlier, Ruskin commented on a similar phenom- enon in the context of considering the value of decorative art within the manufacturing culture of the Victorian Era. Like Cicero and Simonides before him, walking through fantastic halls of phantom buildings to locate the fragments of their texts vis-a-vis the rhetorical art of memory, Ruskin places great value on the work of art whose specific meaning is established through its location in a specific place within the language of architecture.26 In his lecture of 1859, "Modern Manufacture and Design," Ruskin proposed that "portable art-in- dependent of all place-is for the most part ignoble art. ... It is, in- deed, possible that the portable picture or image may be first-rate of its kind, but it is not first-rate because it is portable; nor are Titian's frescoes less than first-rate because they are fixed; nay, very frequently the highest compliment you can pay to a cabinet picture is to say-'it is as grand as a fresco'."27 Not only is the syntactic relationship of the work of art to its setting critical (such as the relationship of the heroic decorative cycle to the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Ducal Palace in Venice), but also at stake is the viewer's participation in a specific place at a specific time. That there is only one room in Venice con- taining that series of paintings is just as important in the philosophy of Ruskin and Benjamin as is the relationship of the "mythic" content of the cycle (depicting Venice's emergence as the third great European power) to the city within which it is located. The AntiText and the Mise en Scene Every real effigy has a shadow which is its double: and art must falter and fail from the moment the sculptor believes he has lib- erated the kind of shadow whose very existence will destroy his repose. -Antonin Artaud, The Theater and Its Double The contemporary problem is not to destroy the narrative but to subvert it; today's task is to dissociate subversion from destruction. -Roland Barthes, The ThirdMeaning Perhaps one of the most egregious examples of an apparently trans- parent relationship between architectural production and building construction is offered by the medieval model of architect as master builder. The few drawings that survive from that period demonstrate the clear and diaphanous relationship between "place" and the mak- ing of a work of art variously considered in the writings of Benjamin and Ruskin. They are brief, economical, and by definition incom- plete. Never considered ends in themselves, these drawings both documented and demonstrated the making of the edifice, displaying obscure procedures and divine truths, the sources of which were clouded in intentional mystery.28 The drawing and design of the ar- chitecture occurred at the site of construction. Such in situ "making" was also true of sculpture, painting, and mosaic work of the time, 79 Dodds</page><page sequence="5">which was conceived and "constructed" within a specific architectural location as well as a specific "narrative" location. In contradistinction to the majority of present-day artistic and architectural production, the geographic site of the Gothic work of art was related to the conceptual site of the work.29 Although influential modern architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Carlo Scarpa both referred to the work they produced and the means by which they produced it in specifically medieval terms, the Gothic in- fluence on modern architectural production has been relegated to the margins of recent history. Ostensibly, Mies was fascinated with the Gothic and characterized the glass walls of the Barcelona Pavilion as particularly Gothic in spirit. Carlo Scarpa, in a well-known self-refer- ence, described himself as a modern architect who came from Venice by way of Byzantium. Indeed, the relationship between Scarpa's method of working and Gothic methodology is well documented. Using extensive site visits and site drawings, often drawing directly on the surface of the building at the specific site of reconstruction, Scarpa made a point of extending the activity of design into the period of construction-developing, redesigning, and exploiting the construc- tion techniques indigenous to the site's locale. However, Mies and Scarpa clearly operated well outside the norm of practice of their times. Long before the twentieth century, perhaps as early as the fifteenth century, the construction of architec- ture and the conception of architecture, a relationship so important to the work of both of these architects, began to disassociate. The dis- continuity between "making" and "construction" that seems particu- lar to contemporary practice may have been first codified by Alberti in De Re Aedificatoria. Although in the Prologue Alberti distanced his model of architect from the Gothic paradigm, at the close of Book Nine, he went so far as to warn the architect against becoming too in- volved in the supervision of the construction. "Should you propose to supervise and execute the work, you will hardly be able to avoid hav- ing sole responsibility for all the errors and mistakes committed by others."30 Consequently, as the art of building became established as a discipline, it became more distant from the artifice of construction, making more opaque the relationship of the maker and the made. In sharp contrast to the problems raised by Benjamin and Ruskin, the work of the French surrealist poet and theater activist Antonin Artaud offers an explicit architectural analogue that seems substantially less resistant to mimetic inquiry.31 Quite outside the Albertian schema, Artaud presented a proposal for restoring the rela- tionship of "place" and a work of art while diminishing the distance and opacity between the participant and the realm of the work pro- duced. Paralleling to some extent the work of his contemporary Sergei Eisenstein, and seen today as an extension of work began by Meyerhold in prerevolutionary Russia and Fuch's "theatrical theater" of late-nineteenth-century Germany, Artaud proposed a theater that moved between ecstasy and madness. Like Giambattista Piranesi be- fore him, Artaud's projection of the mise en scene was as much an in- dictment of the "prisons of invention" as it was an invitation to broaden and enrich the space-making capacity of the theater of archi- tecture. For Artaud, the mise en scene of theater was equivalent to a "poetry in space." "This very difficult and complex poetry assumes many aspects: especially the aspects of all the means of expression uti- lizable on the stage, such as music, dance, plastic art, pantomime, mimicry, gesticulation, intonation, architecture, lighting, and scen- ery."32As in Piranesi's Prisons, all multiply and simultaneously per- ceived, these various aspects of the mise en scene constituted, for Artaud, the virtual space of the performance, activating the physical space of the theater. Artaud considered post-Elizabethan "psychological theater" in- capable of either embodying or fully expressing shared human mean- ing. Operating predominantly within the strictures of the spoken (literal) text, occidental theater, for Artaud, suffered from a dearth of human experience and a relatively narrow view of the potentials of human expression. Just as Ruskin had proposed defining the inten- tions of architecture through the negation of technique, so too Artaud proposed redefining theater through the negation of the determinism of the text. For Artaud, authentic theater was, in essence, every poten- tially expressive and meaningful aspect of a production other than the written text, i.e., its antitext. In the radical language of a revolution- ary, Artaud argued, "A theater which subordinates the mise en scene and production, i.e., everything in itself that is specifically theatrical, to the text, is a theater of idiots, madmen, inverts, grammarians, gro- cers, antipoets and positivists."3 In LArt decoratifdaujour'dui, Le Corbusier proposed that art and architecture are "the living double of being."34 The mise en scene of theater is, for Artaud, a kind of double as well, the shadow of the physical, transformed into a more pervasive and complete under- standing. However, expression alone was not Artaud's concern. Nor was he simply interested in a fuller, broader ranging experience. Like his contemporary Marcel Duchamp, Artaud was uninterested in the merely pictorial.35 In fact, throughout Artaud's writings are found co- pious references to the "mimesis," "alchemy," and " The Metaphysics of the Mise en Scene," thereby reconfirming the central theme of his work-that the making of theater, and by extension the activity of making any work of art, has the potential of being akin to "The Great Work" of the alchemist. "There is a mysterious identity of essence be- tween the principle of the theater and that of alchemy. For like al- chemy, the theater, considered from the point of view of its deepest principles, is developed from a certain number of fundamentals which are the same for all the arts and which aim on the spiritual and imagi- November 1992 JAE 46/2 80</page><page sequence="6">nary level at an efficacity analogous to the process which in the physi- cal world actually turns all matter into gold. But there is a still deeper resemblance between the theater and alchemy, one which leads much further metaphysically. It is that alchemy and the theater are so to speak virtual arts, and do not carry their end-or their reality- within themselves."36 Artaud's conception of the mise en scene seems to stand in sharp contrast to the problematic "technological phenom- enon" described by Ellul, which establishes "method" as both means and end. The alchemical/mimetic schema is critical for Artaud's concep- tion of the antitext of theater. Within the site of Artaud's mise en scene, it is virtually impossible to see the work of art as merely a repre- sentation of appearance only. Rather, the alchemical/mimetic act is inherently incomplete, pointing backward, as Plato described. The goal of this mimetic activity is not so much the making of a complete form nor, for that matter, the structuring of a complete event, but rather a movement toward the completion of knowledge.37 The par- ticipant is both witness of and player in this act of completion. Through this mimetic animation, which is at once spatial and con- ceptual, the actual is transformed into the virtual, pointing toward the ideal, thereby creating the nexus of authenticity and place of which Ruskin and Benjamin spoke and ameliorating the resistance and opacity of technique. Disegno, Design, and the Drawing-Out of Architecture Seeing that disegno, the parent of our three arts, Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, having its origin in the intellect, draws out from many single things a general judgment, it is like a form or idea of all the objects in nature, most marvellous in what it compasses, for not only in the bodies of men and of animals but also in plants, in buildings, in sculpture and in painting, disegno is cognizant of the proportion of the whole to the parts and of the parts to each other and to the whole. See- ing too that from this knowledge there arises a certain concep- tion and judgment, so that there is formed in the mind that something which afterwards, when expressed by the hands, is called disegno, we may conclude that disegno is not other than a visible expression and declaration of our inner conception and of that which others have imagined and given form to in their idea. -Giorgio Vasari, Lives ofthe Artists. Art is an ability which points the way. -Attributed to Zeno Although chronologically quite distant from the theater of Artaud, the relationship of Gothic architecture to Scholasticism shares many critical aspects of the structure of Artaud's mise en scene. Moreover, al- though considering the relationship of the Gothic Scholastic to the text of the cathedral alongside the theater ofAntonin Artaud seems an anachronistic juxtaposition, it nonetheless serves to reintroduce a con- ceptual model that may point the way to an enriched state of architec- tural production. In his essay, "Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism," Erwin Panofsky discussed the "place" of participation (physically and conceptually) in the Scholastic's understanding of a high Gothic cathedral. Just as the palimpsest of Reims and the sketches of Villard de Honnecourt (perhaps the two most egregious extant drawings from the period) were considered essentially incom- plete, so too was the edifice of Gothic architecture. Similar to Artaud's schema of the inherent incompleteness of theater, the high Gothic ca- thedral awaited the Scholastic to complete it through the "reconstruc- tion" of participation (membrification). Panofsky explains that the intention of such an architecture is neither purely rational nor wholly illusionistic. "We are faced neither with 'rationalism' in a purely func- tionalistic sense nor with 'illusion' in the sense of modern Iartpour Iart aesthetics. We are faced with what may be termed a 'visual logic' illustrative of Thomas Aquinas's nam et sensus ratio quaedam est."38 The "truth" of Gothic Scholasticism and architecture was, for Panofsky, a conjunction of the image and rational speculation.39 Such a poetic reasoning would not necessarily make a distinction between the experience of a written summa (i.e., an exhaustive and systematic presentation on a subject) and that of an architectural summa. "A man imbued with the Scholastic habit would look upon the mode of archi- tectural presentation, just as he looked upon the mode of literary pre- sentation, from the point of view of manifestatio."40 Thus in Scholasticism, the reading of a summa and the bodily experience of a thirteenth century French Gothic cathedral (which was itself an archi- tectural analogue for the summa) were one in the same. The "func- tion" of the experience of both was that of manifestare, i.e., to make clear one's understanding. "[The Scholastic] would have taken it for granted that the pri- mary purpose of the many elements that compose a cathedral was to ensure stability, just as he took it for granted that the primary purpose of the many elements that constitute a Summa was to ensure validity. But he would not have been satisfied had not the membrification of the edifice permitted him to re-experience the very processes of archi- tectural composition just as the membrification of the Summa permit- ted him to re-experience the very process of cogitation."41 Consequently, the Scholastic initiates truly participated with the ar- chitecture in that through their participation, they reconstructed the making of the cathedral (conceptually and mechanically), entering 81 Dodds</page><page sequence="7">into a speculation or silent disputare on the relationship of the cathedral's many elements in terms of their place and character. The function of the Scholastic's reading of the text of the cathedral became a vehicle for inquiring as to the pre-conditions of the architectural text. To the Scholastic participant, "the panoply of shafts, ribs, but- tresses, tracery, pinnacles, and crockets was a self-analysis and self-ex- plication of architecture much as the customary apparatus of parts, distinctions, questions, and articles was, to him, a self-explication of reason."42 As the Gothic Scholastics constructed and reconstructed the ca- thedral, they entered into the mimetic activity of architecture, passing through, as it were, a threshold into the realm of architectural specula- tion. This bounded place shares many aspects of the mediating phase of rites of transition known as the liminal. Limen in Latin signifies "threshold." All rites of transition, of which the Scholastic initiate's participation in the summa of the high Gothic cathedral is analogous, are composed of three distinct phases: separation, limen, and aggrega- tion.43 "Liminality may involve a complex sequence of episodes in sa- cred space-time, and may also include subversive and ludic (or playful) events.... In other words, in liminality people 'play' with the elements of the familiar and defamiliarize them .... Then the factors or elements of culture may be recombined in numerous, often gro- tesque ways, grotesque because they are arrayed in terms of possible or fantasied rather than experienced combinations."44 Anthropologist Victor Turner suggests that the product of the mimetic activity of ar- chitectural speculation is a "monster," i.e., a recombination of other- wise conventional elements into a new and "unnatural" condition.45 Through this activity of constructing "monsters," meaning is estab- lished and expressed within a discrete social condition, i.e., cultural space. Aristotle's provocation of the mimesis of praxis suggests that art, and by extension architecture, is at its source the imitation of action. Yet through the construct of liminality and the (re)construction of monsters, another possibility is presented-that architectural specula- tion, grounded within cultural space, is more than an imitation of action as Aristotle suggested; it is an invitation to action as well. "Liminality, marginality, and structural inferiority are conditions in which are frequently generated myths, symbols, rituals, philosophical systems, and works of art. These cultural forms provide men with a set of templates or models which are, at one level, periodical reclassifi- cations of reality and man's relationship to society, nature, and cul- ture. But they are more than classifications, since they invite men to action, as well as thought."46 The drawings and buildings of Michelangelo and Borromini and, more recently, Mies van der Rohe and Scarpa stand as paradig- matic models of the capacity of architectural constructions to act as both "imitations of action" and "invitations to action."47 Their works stand as summae, waiting for the initiate to ground their speculation within the "place" of their initial making-to (re)construct and "re- experience the very process of cogitation." The relationship between the drawings and buildings of these particular architects is further dis- tinguished by the way in which these drawings were made and how the experience of the built architecture gives access to the preceding activity of making-i.e., the lineamenta. Vasari and his contemporar- ies called this activity of making a work of art the disegno.48 Through the disegno (interno and esterno) the project emerges and becomes sen- sible to the maker. The activity and idea of disegno was, for Vasari, more than simply the drawing of lines. It was a drawing-out as well- an epiphany that was an explication as much as it was a revelation. The disegno of Michelangelo's sculpture of St. Matthew was essen- tially the same as, for example, the disegno of the Porta Pia or the Laurentian Library. Although the means of the disegno were obviously different (one removing layers of marble, the other assembling lines and tonal values on a sheet of paper), the essential nature was the same. It is fitting that Panofsky ended his lecture, "Scholasticism and Gothic Architecture," with a commentary on a drawing by Villard De Honnecourt. Panofsky described and explained the drawing as a per- fect emblem of the Scholastic's explication of "the true." The page from Villard's sketchbook consists of two plan sketches of an "ideal" chevet and an inscription, added later by a follower of Villard, that acts as an indirect commentary on the image of the plan. Like the impresa of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italy that consisted of an "image" and a "motto," both of which pointed independently to the concetto, so too this drawing by Villard stands as a recorded history of the Scholastic activity of disputare as described by Aquinas, which was intended to explicate the concetto and was itself a reconstruction of knowledge.49 "Every Topic (e.g., the context of every articulus in the Summa Theologiae) had to be formulated as a quaestio the discus- sion of which begins with the alignment of one set of authorities (videtur quod.. .) against the other (sed contra.. .), proceeds to the so- lution (respondeo dicendum .. .) and is followed by an individual cri- tique of the arguments rejected (adprimum, ad secundum, etc.)."50 The drawing of the "ideal" chevet was made in the course of such an exchange between Villard and another Master Builder, Pierre de Cor- bie. The inscription was clearly intended, in part, to "place" the draw- ing within the disputatio of a Scholastic inquiry. "Here, then, we have two High Gothic architects discussing a quaestio, and a third one [the disciple] referring to this discussion by the specifically Scholastic term disputare."51 Panofsky concluded his description and analysis of the November 1992 JAE 46/2 82</page><page sequence="8">drawing with the provocation, "Here Scholastic dialectics has driven architectural thinking to a point where it almost ceased to be architec- tural."52 This study has attempted to locate the place of architectural speculation, to explicate the relationship between the speculative act of architecture and mimetic inquiry. Moreover, it has suggested that the separation of building and architecture, perhaps first codified by Alberti, may in fact contribute to the opacity of technique endemic of contemporary architectural production. Indeed, the amelioration of the schism of "making" and "place" may begin when dependence on the false dichotomies of theory and practice, theoria and praxis, end. However, reconstructing the relationship of making and site in archi- tectural speculation does not require the Gothic coincidence of the building site and design. Rather, it requires a reevaluation of what constitutes a site, the very definition of site in architectural produc- tion. Although Villard de Honnecourt and the anonymous Master Builder of the Reims Palimpsest (and indeed the modernist of Byzantium, Carlo Scarpa) located their speculation at the physical site of building, today in the architectural studio, we can begin to recog- nize the site of architecture within the drawings and studies we con- struct. These constructions invite the maker and those who participate with them to enter into an anamnesis, a remaking through memory, the intent of which is to reveal a more perfect condition, placed within the cultural space we construct through praxis.53 As with Villard and Pierre de Corbie, the place (locus) of this anamnesis is the activity of constructing, i.e., primarily building and drawing. Through these monstrous constructions, the speculative architectural project emerges as the recorded history of the coincidence of imita- tions (of actions) and invitations (to action). However, although one can distinguish between representations that depict intended images and those that hope to reveal hidden intentions, one need not con- sider either to be, by necessity, exclusive in nature. In other words, within the discipline of architecture, all activities of making present the opportunity of leaving a trace of the conceptual making (disegno interno) within the representations we construct (disegno esterno),5 cre- ating a mimesis of the architectural project at hand. The theater of Artaud and the Scholasticism of the Gothic share the goal of deobjectification through haptic and intellectual par- ticipation. Yet, the textual analogue of Scholasticism seems to define and delimit architecture as a kind of imitation of writing. In contrast, Antonin Artaud, through the vehicle of the theatrical mise en scene, proposed a negation of the determinism of the text in the making of a work of art. While the Gothic Scholastic viewed the architecture of the cathedral through the analogue of the text, the mise en scene of Artaud points in a direction away from a dependency on the written word, in the direction of intonation, gesture, and architecture. The provocation for the discipline of architecture seems that of construct- ing speculative projects that are less like writing and more like draw- ing, the drawing of disegno. Drawing as image and as activity-a drawing-out of architecture. Drawing as double. This study has attempted to locate architectural speculation within the activity of making. As we have seen, this architectural mo- ment is not limited to drawing and building alone. Included within the activity of constructing is, as the writings of Artaud and Panofsky illustrate, the in situ participation and reconstruction of the whole through the considered relationship of the parts.55 When we consider the possibility of building architecture that presents a memory of the making (internal and external) within the aspect of its form and the structure of its space, then the mimetic capacity of an architectural project, independent of utility yet placed within human actions, is further extended and enhanced. Deep within the activity of architec- ture is the locus of its double. Although it may appear that in the end all we achieve is crafted form, it is its double that persists.56 Acknowledgments Certain aspects of this paper were developed during a series of lectures presented at the Catholic University of America Summer Architecture Institute of 1987.

The distinction between architecture and building is intended to distin- guish the discipline from the profession. It should not be equated with the erroneous distinction between theory and practice, which is a corrupt permutation of the Aris- totelian distinction of theoria and praxis. Aristotle uses these terms to distinguish be- tween two distinct yet interrelated parts of a full and valuable human life. "The former expression signifies the disciplines and activities that are concerned with knowing for its own sake.... 'Praxis ... signifies the disciplines and activities pre- dominant in man's ethical and political life. These disciplines, which require knowl- edge and practical wisdom, can be contrasted with 'theoria' because their end is not knowing or wisdom for its own sake, but doing-living well. When we add that for 83 Dodds</page><page sequence="9">Aristotle, individual ethical activity is properly a part of the study of political activ- ity-activity in the 'polis', we can say that 'praxis' signifies the free activity (and the disciplines concerned with this activity) in the 'polis'. We must be careful not to dis- tort the spirit of Aristotle's distinctions. Although 'theoria,' the etymological source of our word 'theory,' is sometimes translated as 'contemplation,' 'contemplation' tends to suggest a receptive and passive state of mind. But for Aristotle, 'theoria' is a form of life that involves strenuous disciplined activity. It is not entirely accurate to call 'theoria' and 'praxis ways or forms of life, for according to Aristotle they emerge as two dimensions of the truly human and free life." See Richard J.

"The imitator ... is a long way off the truth, and can do all things be- cause he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part an image .... And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else . . . with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man-whoever tells us this ... is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance of imitation." See Plato, Republic, X, 601. 15. The historian Karl Morrison explains that "the concepts of the two para- digms [Art and Nature] contained Plato's celebrated program for the purification of the soul by movement of egress and return. Before they descended from heaven to live in the body, all souls saw the eternal Forms, and images of the Forms were left in their minds. Once the soul came into the world, both the images and knowledge of the divine paradigm faded. Knowledge was virtue; and, in this highest sense, virtue, as the recollection of the divine paradigm, could neither be taught nor constructed by exercising the reason. It was an instinct given by God and not necessarily accom- panied by reason-a 'conversion' that transformed the soul from darkness into light. By this gift of 'divine' or 'philosophical madness,' the virtuous soul could cast off its estrangement from its heavenly origins and pass up the hierarchy of arts, through hu- man institutions and laws, to perceive 'the single science, the science of beauty every- where."'

Giambattista Vico's epistemological speculation of the ancient etymo- logical relationship of "the true" and "what is made" is useful in constructing an un- derstanding of the apparent conflict between the "place" of mimesis and the rise of technique. This eighteenth-century philosopher of imagination proposed not only that the artifice of mimesis needs to be grounded within the community of man, but more importantly, that man's access to first principles is possible solely through his contemplation on the products of man-beginning with the most essential of the civil institutions. In De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia, Vico begins by establishing the critical epistemic thesis of the essay: "Latin 'true' and 'made' are the same ... Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the ancient sages of Italy entertained the fol- lowing beliefs about the true. "The true is precisely what is made ( Verum esse ipsum factum)." In his New Science, Vico further develops this verum/factum principle by comparing two distinctly different kinds of human knowledge. Vico contends that, while we can "know of' nature, we can never "know" it in the intimate and complete way we can know the products of artifice. For Vico, natural philosophy can never lead to first principles because nature is closed to man-first principles are accessible only through that which man has made. Upon considering the verum/factum postu- late that Vico has distilled from his etymology of the language of the ancient Italians, a critical relationship seems to exist between the factum and the "maker." For "the true" to be known, a relatively transparent condition must exist between the "made" and the "known" for the maker to recognize the "true." Vico states, "In the night of thick darkness enveloping the earliest antiquity, so remote from ourselves, there shines the eternal and never failing light of truth beyond all question; that the world of civil society has certainly been made by men, and its principles are therefore to be found within the modifications of our human mind. Whoever reflects on this cannot but marvel that the philosophers should have bent all their energies to the study of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He alone knows; and that they should have neglected the study of the world of nations, or civil world, which since men made it, men could come to know." See Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold Fisch, eds., The New Science of Giambattista Vico (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984), Book I, Section III, #330-31. Although nature can be studied and mimicked, it can never lead to the hidden structure that precedes appearance. Ironi- cally, Vico contends that to "understand what is hidden from men," we need to study that which man has made. For Vico, this study is an act of divination, through which man discovers, not only what is hidden from mankind, but also "the future- or what is hidden in [mankind]-their consciousness. It is this divinatory providence that makes up the first and principal part of jurisprudence, namely the divine institu- tions [e.g., augery] on which depend the human institutions." In his concept of divi- nation, Vico appears to transform Plato's principle of mimesis. Contained within these condensed First Principles of Vico's "method" of inquiry, we find the funda- mental schema that constitutes the virtual places of the sensus communis through which we sense and make sense out of our artifice and artifacts.

See "Some Characteristics of a New Concept of Technology," JAE42/1 (1988): 4-9. 23. In L Art decoratifd'aujourd'hui, Le Corbusier comments on this polarity through a comparison of "tools" and "art." "If decorative art has no reason to exist, tools on the other hand do exist, and there exist also architecture and the work of art. A tool, something that gives service: a servant, a menial; a piece of domestic equip- ment. One single requirement: that it serves well. Architecture is a construct of the mind which gives material form to the sum consciousness of its age. Architecture only exists when there is a poetic ... seen and measured by the eyes." Thus, Le Corbusier establishes the inherent dichotomy of architectural speculation, that it is at once a live, bodily condition and also a conceptual construct with explicit sign value.

The art historian Erwin Panofsky anecdotally describes the relationship of the architect to the design and construction of the high Gothic cathedral: "[The architect] would appear at the site, 'carrying gloves and a rod' (virga), to give those curt orders that became a byword in French literature whenever a writer wished to describe a man who does things well and with superior assurance, 'Par cy me le taille' (Here's where you cut it for me)."

The crisis and extreme shift that Artaud and Duchamp represent are rooted in the nineteenth-century dissolution of the Renaissance aesthetic dualism of Beauty and Idea, which formed the core of an emerging theory of art. In the late Quattrocento and Cinquecento, the complex rendering of the conceptual text of a work of art and architecture was referred to as the difficulta of the work. Contained within the idea of difficulta was not only the difficulty of the making of the work, i.e., technically and physically, but more importantly, referred to the difficulty of dis- cerning the concetto of the work. With the partial intention of "elevating" painting and architecture to the level of the liberal arts, Vasari and others contributed to con- structing a theoretical structure for the making and criticism of art. Difficulta occu- pied a critical position within the rich matrix of conceptual paradigms that consti- tuted one-half of the late Renaissance aesthetic dualism of Idea and Beauty. Prior to the late nineteenth- /early twentieth-century dissolution of this parallel structured Renaissance schema, the value of a work of art was measured against both the beauty of its appearance and its ability to excite certain cogent ideas in the viewer's mind. However, as the conventional basis of Beauty became increasingly unclear, so too did the role of beauty within the making, theory, and criticism of a work of art. Con- versely, as the role of Beauty diminished, the importance of Idea substantially in- creased to the degree that, if Beauty is considered at all within contemporary discussions of art and architecture, it is usually as a subset of Idea. The development of early twentieth-century art and art theory witnessed a growing schism between the visual and conceptual, brought into focus by the cubists and culminating, for a time, in the work of the surrealists. Traces of "The Great Work" are found today in the ac- tivities of the "performance artist," the memory of Tinguely's exploding sculptures, and the current explosion of neosuprematist architectural projections.

Within the liminality of mimesis, conventional attributes are, by necessity, ambiguous, "since this condition ... elude(s) ... the network of classifica- tions that normally locates status and positions in 'cultural space'." Just as the basic condition of the liminal activity of architectural speculation is transformational, so too are the activities of this process concerned with transformations of both things and ideas.
