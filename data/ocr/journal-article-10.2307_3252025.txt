<plain_text><page sequence="1">"0 vendetta di Dio": The Motif of Rape and Retaliation in Dante's Inferno Tobias Foster Gittes Having considered the full implications of the somber advice "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate"' (Inf. III, 9) inscribed on hell's portal, the sixteenth-century critic Castelvetro, a staunch literalist, wryly observes that this assertion is proven false by Dante himself, "poiche' vuole che i santi padri v'entrassono e n'uscissono, e Cristo similmente ed Enea, e Teseo, ed Ercole e Traiano e Beatrice e l'angelo, che fa aprir la porta a Dite, e Virgilio esce e rientra, ed esso Dante non e ritenuto e Catone."' In short, the door lies! Indeed, there exists a small army of worthies for whom the yawning portal, despite its ominous inscription, marks the road not to perdition, but salvation; for whom the squalid reaches of hell are not a terminus, but a way station on a journey undertaken to free themselves, or others, from infernal bondage. In the Commedia, it is Christ's descent into hell that establishes the ideal point of reference for all other descents; classical descents like that of Hercules or Aeneas may be viewed as "shadowy prefaces" to the central narrative of Christ's harrowing: Christian descents like that of Beatrice and Dante as a variety of postscript. The notion that Christ descended to hell during the period between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, liberated the First Parents, patriarchs, and other virtuous Hebrews from limbo, trampled 'Dartmouth Dante Project, Castelvetro [1570] 3-Inf.

Prominent among these narratives was the concluding section of the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, the Descensus Christi ad inferos. The anonymous author of this rousing account of Christ's conquest of hell skillfully contrasts the joyful expectation of the enslaved souls awaiting liberation with the frenzied anguish of Satan and his minions as they desperately scramble to throw up defensive metal barricades. Satan's frantic efforts are, of course, unavailing and Christ, "coming in the bright- ness of celestial light from on high, compassionate, great, and lowly, carrying a chain in his hand" (Latin B, 8 [24].I.), easily binds him and casts him into the dark pit of Tartarus.3 This jarring juxtaposition of charity and chains is a forceful reminder that the same Christ who stretches forth one hand to draw Adam and his company to freedom (8[24]. I.) wields a chain with the other. Christ's mission in hell is not simply to reward the virtuous, but to punish the wicked; his act of salvation is simultaneously an act of depredation, his gain, a devastating loss to a ravished, and humiliated hell. While Dante's commentators have tended to overlook this violent, punitive component of Christ's harrowing, Dante, I would argue, does not. The pages that follow represent an attempt to recover and restore this long-neglected facet of Dante's Christ: an avenging Christ who, in words that Jacobus de Voragine attributes to 2 Paul interprets Psalms 67.19 where "captivity" is made a "captive" as a prefiguration of Christ's descent into hell and bondage of Satan (see also Eph. 4.8-10; Mt. 12.40; Rom. 10.6-8.); the sundering of the "gates of Hades" is alluded to in Matthew 16.18 (see also Mt. 16.18; Rev. 1.18.); Christ cast as "Lord of both the dead and the living" is a motif recurrent in the Pauline epistles (see, for example, Romans 14.9;1 Cor. 15. 55- 57); in 1 Peter we read that Christ "went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison" (3. 19-20); and, finally, the notion of a partial resurrection at the moment of the crucifixion is supplied by Matthew's vivid description of opened tombs and resurrected saints (27. 51-53). For Christ, victor over Death/God of dead and living see also: Phil. 2.10-11; Col. 1.18; 2 Tim. 4.1; Acts. 10.42, 2.24-31; 1 Peter. 4.5-6; Rev. 5.13. 3 From J.K. Elliott's translation in The Apocryphal New Testament (New York: Oxford UP, 1993). The Gospel of Nicodemus in turn inspired the production of a large number of partial and full retellings of the story. Among the most readily available of these were Jacobus de Voragines's version of the story in his widely-circulated Legenda aurea (chap. 54) and the popular Pseudo-Augustine Sermo 160, De Pascha (Patrologia Latina vol. 39).

In sharp contrast to the exuberant drama of the Gospel of Nicodemus, Virgil's testimony consists of a perfunctory listing of liberated souls that ranges from the First Parents to the Hebrew patriarchs before ending rather abruptly with the vague notice that "molti altri" had likewise been saved. Indeed, Virgil's journalistic account of the harrowing is consistent with a pattern in the Commedia whereby Christ's transient presence in hell is, paradoxically, signaled by an enduring absence; the absence of a lock-"serrame" (Inf. VIII, 126)-on the great doors of hell, the despoliation of the righteous souls in limbo, the ruinous cavity left by the collapsed ponticelli of Malabolge (Inf. XXI, 1lOff) and, most poignantly, the absence of hope among those, like Virgil, who are constrained to witness a redemption from which they themselves are forever excluded. Amilcare Iannucci, the critic who has done most to remind us of the vast influence that the Descensus Christi ad inferos exercised on Dante's own Christian epic, has argued that the cumulative effect of Dante's bold innovations to the orthodox conception of limbo-in particular the inclusion of virtuous pagans in this precinct tradition- ally reserved for patriarchs and unbaptized infants-has been to shift the emphasis from the physical "comedy" of Christ's liberation of the righteous Hebrews stranded in limbo to the intellectual "tragedy" of the poets, philosophers, and other magnanimous pagans cut off from the ultimate, Christian, truth for all eternity.5 Iannucci goes on to 4Jacobus de Voragine, The Golden Legend, trans. William Granger Ryan (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1993). Jacobus's source seems to be the Pseudo-Augustinian Sermo 160, De Pascha, II which, however, is substantially different: "Invasor est, non debitor; exactor est, non precator: judicem videmus, non supplicem" (PL vol. 39). 5 See Amilcare Iannucci, "The Harrowing of Dante from Upper Hell," in Lectura Dantis: Inferno, ed. Allen Mandelbaum et al. (Berkeley: California UP, 1998) and "The Gospel of Nicodemus in Medieval Italian Literature: a Preliminary Assessment," in The Medieval Gospel of Nicodemus 165-205. For a more detailed discussion of this shift in emphasis from presence to absence, see Iannucci's "Limbo: The Emptiness of Time," in Studi danteschi 52 (1979-80): 69-128. With regard to the idiosyncrasies of Dante's conception of limbo, see in particular Giorgio Padoan's "I1 Limbo Dantesco" (Lettere Italiane 21.4 [Ottobre-Dicembre 1969]) and chapters 10-12 of Kenelm Foster's illuminating study, The Two Dantes (Berkeley: California UP, 1977). 3</page><page sequence="4">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES point out that Dante, "too alert to the dramatic possibilities of the imagery traditionally associated with the harrowing to abandon it altogether" (127), simply removed it to a different context: the confrontation with the recalcitrant devils at the gates of Dite in cantos eight and nine of Inferno. Beneath the famously obscure events surrounding Dante's and Virgil's entrance into lower hell-the antagonistic reception by the custodian devils, failed negotiations, and timely intervention of a celestial emissary-lannucci discerns not only a christianized reconfiguration of images and motifs drawn from the epic descent of Aeneas in Aeneid VI, but a "postfiguration" (131) of a Christian epic whose considerable influence in the Commedia has been largely neglected: the Descensus Christi ad inferos.6 Iannucci's thesis that Dante deliberately downplays the dramatic component of the harrowing narrative in canto IV as a way of thematizing the spiritual, psychological, and intellectual emptiness of limbo, and displaces the traditional harrowing drama to the sacra rappresentazione of canto IX, does much to illuminate these obscure cantos; however, it is important to note that Dante's parsing of the harrowing drama into these two temporally and spatially discrete "acts" is not simply a matter of poetic choice, but is dictated by a number of purely practical considerations and sanctioned, moreover, by an authoritative theological precedent. In the Gospel of Nicodemus, as we have seen, Christ is personally instrumental not only in the liberation of the First Parents, patriarchs, and other limbo-dwellers but in the subsequent "binding" of Satan (who is consigned to "Inferus," a personified Hell, in compensation for the freed souls): an account of Christ's underworld activities that has all the extravagance of a miracle play but does not actually contradict Christian doctrine. In the Commedia, by contrast, Dante, a self-styled "scribe of God" (Par. X, 27), implicitly challenges the authority of the Church Fathers by taking up his pen to record a new proem to sacred history never dreamt of in their theology. According to this bold rescripting of Scripture, the bondage of Lucifer was not a consequence of Christ's military conquest of hell, but actually pre- ceded the creation of the First Parents. Indeed, both the inhabited 6 One of the earliest, and most discerning of Dante's commentators, Benvenuto da Imola, in attempting to account for the Devil's determination to keep Dante and Virgil from entering Dite notes: "Et sic vide et dictis cessat obiectio quam solent quidam facere, quare daemones non recipiebant Dantem libenter ut lucrarentur illam animam?

XXXIV, 126). While this liberal revision of sacred history has the valuable effect of preempting any possible shadow of dualism (for this Lucifer is quite literally integrated into the spiritual, moral, and physical architecture of providence) it simultaneously dispenses with the need to-or even possibility of- "capturing captivity" (to paraphrase the Psalmist) that is so pressing in the traditional accounts of the descensus. Fettered by the ice of Coccitus and gagged by the writhing bodies of the archtraitors Cassius, Judas, and Brutus, this domesticated Satan, a dutiful func- tionary, is hardly equipped to engage Christ in a physical or verbal showdown! Though Dante, poet, gives no clear indication of the actual route followed by Christ during the course of his harrowing, it is logical to infer that the liberator Christ, having himself been liberated by Dante from the traditional duty of binding Satan, did not bother penetrat- ing the lower reaches of hell, but having gathered together the souls of limbo simply retraced his steps to the surface.7 The external fringe of the cavernous gorge of Hell, a vestibular area that encompasses both the great portal of hell and the circle of limbo, is alone associated with Christ's physical descent: an event described by an eye-witness, Virgil (Inf. IV, 52-63), and corroborated by the physical evidence of the unhinged doors of hell (Inf. VIII, 126). Other evidence of Christ's influence in hell (the occasional "ruine" that attest to scattered local collapses of hell's masonry infrastructure) is not predicated on Christ's presence-his physical passage through a given area-but can be traced back to the seismic upheaval simulta- neous with the Crucifixion. This, at least, is the theory advanced by Virgil, who proposes that the massive retaining walls that once separated the sixth and seventh circles were demolished by the 7 The author of the Ottimo commentary observes that Christ shattered the external doors of hell in descending to limbo but did not break those of Dite, "che non v'avea dentro gente da lui" DDP L'Ottimo [1333], 10-Inf. Before Dante posited a terrestrial sphere perforated by Lucifer's fall, thereby ingeniously providing a means of telescop- ing the traditionally opposed movements of descent and ascent into a single, continuous, vector-like motion along a single axis, it was safe to assume that even the most resourceful harrower would have had no alternative but to retrace his steps to the upper world. However, this new model of a pierced planet introduces the possibility that Christ might, at least theoretically, have anticipated Dante's trajectory by taking the "direct" route through the center of the earth. 5</page><page sequence="6">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES powerful tremors that rocked hell in the moments before Christ's descent (Inf. XII, 34-45)-a thesis corroborated by the admittedly less-reliable testimony of the Malebranche's leader, Malacoda, who attributes the collapse of Malebolgia's sixth ponticello to the infernal quaking that coincided with the Crucifixion (Inf. XXI, 106ff).8 In sum, Dante appears to distinguish two separate moments in Christ's underworld engagement: the first, a complete "seismic" penetration of hell associated with the Crucifixion; the second, Christ's partial descent in "person" to recover the patriarchs and others marked for salvation from limbo. This parsing of Christ's descent into two successive and comple- mentary stages consisting of a universal penetration in "spirit" fol- lowed by a local descent in the flesh was not one of Dante's innovations, but was already a prominent feature of scholastic ac- counts of the descensus. In his treatment of the descensus episode, Albert the Great separates the harrowing Christ into two discrete components, presence, "praesentia" and power, "potestas." In his "presence," writes Albert, Christ did not descend beyond limbo whereas (it is implied) in his power, he went all the way: Ad secundum dicimus, quod descensus fuit potestatis et praesentiae. Sed infernus non secundum omnem partem sui locus est impiorum, sed tantum secundum infimam. In purgatorio enim et in limbo pii habitabant. Et Christus non descendit praesentia nisi ad limbum. (De incarnatione, Tract VI, De consequentibus unionem ex partefinis. Q. 4-de descensu Christi ad inferos, vol. 26, p. 235)9 Albert's student St. Thomas proposes a similar distinction in his treatment of the descensus in the Summa. In lieu of "praesentiae," St. Thomas uses the term "substantialem praesentiam," and in place of "potestatis," "effectum": "Conclusio-Christus, secundum effectum, in omnem inferni locum descendit; secundum vero substantialem praesentiam, non nisi ad locum descendit justorum" (Summa III, Qu. 52, Art. 2). St. Thomas argues that though Christ's penetration of the lower parts of the earth was universal ("penetravit omnes inferiores partes terrae") and its effects were therefore felt throughout hell, the just alone enjoyed Christ's presence. According to this scholastic model, there is an intimate correspon- 8 Similar allusions to the harrowing may be found in Inferno V, 34; XI, Iff; XXIII, 132, and in Paradiso XXVI, 118; and XXXII, 32ff. 9 From Opera omnia, ed.

One important consequence of the interlinking of moral and geo- logical categories in these scholastic models is that the virtuous souls waiting to be released from bondage are conveniently located in purgatory and limbo, hell's most superficial realms. What this means of course is that Christ's recovery of the patriarchs and other hell- bound worthies requires no deep descent into hell's gloomy pit, the "corde terrae" of Matthew 12.40, but a relatively shallow incursion through the upper reaches of hell. It is, moreover, a model that allows Dante to anticipate, in microcosm, an overarching concern of the Commedia byjuxtaposing the glorious redemption of the virtuous with the radical alienation of the wicked, who are denied even a passing glimpse of the divine good that they so roundly rejected in their lifetime. That Dante uses his account of Christ's descent into limbo (in "presence") to document the reward of the righteous-and the intellectual torment of the virtuous pagans who are left behind-is clear enough. However, the expressly punitive component of the descensus, the making of "captivity a captive" attested by Scripture, enshrined by the popular imagination (and complicated, as we have seen, by Dante's preemptive binding of Lucifer) is not eliminated, but removed to a different context: the encounter with the devils of Dite in cantos eight and nine of Inferno which culminates in Virgil's aborted effort to negotiate an entrance into lower hell.'o Whereas 10 Critics have discerned in the peculiar events surrounding this entrance into Dite not only a reenactment of Christ's harrowing, but allusions to Christ's first advent, the Incarnation. According to this interpretation, Virgil's commendation of Dante's seem- ingly cruel treatment of Argenti, "Alma sdegnosa, / benedetta colei che'n te s'incinse" (VIII, 43-45), invokes the figure of the blessed Virgin, pregnant with Christ, thereby casting Dante as a sort of Christ figure. While proponents of this view interpret this episode as a symbolic dramatization of the First Advent, one in which the gates of Dite assume a salvific, marian function, it is far easier to read this episode as an extended travesty of the advent. Here, the gateway marks the entrance not of paradise, where the virgin Mary is queen of the blessed ("Regina coeli" [Par. XXIII, 128]), but to that realm in which the raped Proserpina is queen of the damned: "regina de l'etterno pianto" (Inf: IX, 44). Here, the familiar figure of the marian hortus conclusus is replaced by a hortus that is distinctly apertus-that is, until the demons slam the gate in Virgil's face! Nor, as we have seen, does the closing of Dite's gate ensure the inviolability of lower hell. In lieu of marian humility and chastity this gateway becomes the site of medusan humiliation and exposure. If Mary represents the possibility of intercession through 7</page><page sequence="8">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES Virgil's testimony in canto IV provides us with a narrative reminis- cence of Christ's harrowing in "presence," the confrontation at the doorway of Dite provides, I propose, the complementary dramatic reenactment of Christ's harrowing in "power." Mortified by his failure to make any headway with the stubborn devils of Dite, Virgil attempts to comfort Dante by alluding-in vague, messianic terms reminiscent of his fourth Eclogue-to the advent of one descending unescorted from above who will pass through the circles of hell ("per li cerchi" [Inf. VIII, 129]) and "open the city" ("per lui ne fia la terra aperta" [130]). Though it is true that a metonymic use of the word "terra" to signify "city" occurs with some frequency in the Commedia, this particular occurrence is invested with unusual force and resonance, for in descending to open the doors of the city Dite, this anonymous emissary is also, in a sense, literally opening the "terra"-the earth itself. Indeed, the architecture of Dante's "baratro infernale" is such that all centripetal movement is simultaneously a penetration of the earth; to move towards the center is to move ever deeper into the earth itself. This notion of a passage through, "per"-rather than a cycling within-the infernal circles with the objective of forcing open the doors of lower hell reveals the more sinister face of the traditional harrowing narrative deliberately masked in Inferno IV: the dynamic penetration and disclosure of the nether realms that precedes the repossession of the elect. If Christ in his presence conducts acts of charity towards the virtuous, in his power-represented by the celestial emissary-he "opens the earth" to chastise and punish the wicked. In the Commedia, the episodic arrangement of the salvific and punitive components of the harrowing may obscure, but by no means eliminates, their essential unity. Indeed, I would argue that though Dante systematically counterpoises the salvific "raptus" of the limbo dwellers against the punitive "rape" of hell, he would have us view both of these infernal "rapes" in relation to Lucifer's primal mutiny against his creator: the pattern and model of all subsequent rapes. This thesis is validated by the striking periphrasis for heaven used by Virgil in canto seven: "la dove Michele / f6 la vendetta del superbo strupo" (Inf VII, 11-12). prayer-often expressed through the verb "impetrare"-Medusa stands for the impos- sibility of redemption, the fixing of one's moral condition-the denominative "impetrare" with the sense of petrification. See in particular Denise Heilbronn's, "Dante's Gate of Dis and the HeavenlyJerusalem," Studies in Philology 72 (1975): 167-92. 8</page><page sequence="9">M L N The hapax legomenon "strupo" (a metathesis of "stupro") used to describe Lucifer's primal act of insolence not only evokes the general idea of violence, but clearly points to a sexual transgression. It is fitting indeed that the word "strupo" is used here alone in all of Dante's works; just as Lucifer's act was historically unique and could never be repeated, the word chosen by Dante to describe that supreme act of arrogance occurs once and is never to be repeated. Virgil's use of the sexually suggestive phrase "puossi far forza ne la deitade" (Inf. XI, 46) to introduce his classification of acts of violence against God may well be designed to remind the reader that the apparent disparities among such sinful acts as blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are belied by their common ancestry in Lucifer's primal "rape" of God." Modern commentators, driven by piety or simply prudery, have generally balked at the notion of a sexualized rape of heaven and maintain, therefore, that by "stupro," Dante intends simply to convey a sense of violent rebellion, not sexual violation. Although the excep- tional use of such a sexually charged word is itself sufficient to invalidate this squeamish perspective, even a brief perusal of the early commentaries confirms the unequivocally sexual connotation of "strupo."12 In the early fourteenth-century Ottimo commentary we read: " The use of the phrase "far forza" as a euphemism for rape is not unusual in Dante's time. In the Decameron, Boccaccio uses the phrase in a "Potiphar's wife" scenario in which a spurned woman falsely accuses the count of Anguersa of having attempted to rape her: "E cosi detto, a una ora messesi le mani ne' capelli e rabuffatigli e stracciatigli tutti e appresso nel petto squarciandosi i vestimenti, cominci6 a gridar forte: 'Aiuto, aiuto! che'l conte d'Anguersa mi vuol far forza"' (II 8, 22). 12 Dante's use of the semantically charged "strupo" assumes the role of a critical touchstone for it reveals as much about the ethos of each commentator (for whom it inevitably presents a stumbling block) as it does about Dante. A cursory perusal of the commentaries indicates that until the sixteenth-century the vast majority of critics (Boccaccio among them) found little impiety in this powerful image of a rape-a deflowering really-of heaven. Anonimo Selmiano [1337], a radical exception to this trend, writes that "Strupo" was the name of one of Lucifer's minions who, in the form of a serpent, slithered about terrorizing the Puglians until Saint Michael slew him (!). In the sixteenth century, the commentator Daniello displays a clear concern regarding the propriety of Dante's use of "strupo": "stuprare e violare, e dicesi delle vergini, e perche qui &amp; posto improprio dal Poeta, egli con questo aggiunto SUPERBO lo medica: perci6 che havevano quegli Angeli cattivi con la superbia loro quasi stuprato il cielo" (DDPDaniello [1568], Inf. 7.10-12). In the eighteenth century, Lombardi argues that in using such powerful sexual imagery to paint a moral lesson, Dante is following the methodology of the authors of Scripture, "le quali per catacresi appropriano molte fiate ai peccati d'infedelta contro Dio i nomi di carnali peccati di adulterio e fornicazione [...] appropria egli il nome di strupo alla infedelta praticata dagli Angeli contro Dio medesimo . . ."

Heaven is like a virgin, immaculate, before being subjected to the violent rebellion of the arch-traitor who, and the anonymous author does not mince words here, attempts to rape, and thereby deflower God's virginal kingdom. Michael's vendetta consists in the military victory over, and expulsion of, Lucifer and his co-conspirators (see Rev. 12.7). However, glorious as this triumph may seem, it is neverthe- less something of a Pyrrhic victory, for it results in the loss of so many angels; by Dante's reckoning in the Convivio, the heavenly population was literally decimated by Lucifer's mutiny ("si perderono alquanti tosto che furono creati, forse in numero de la decima parte" [II v, 12]). Indeed, Dante proposes that human beings were actually created for the express purpose of restoring this lost population ("a la quale restaurare fu l'umana natura poi creata" [II v, 12]). 3 Though the author of the Ottimo commentary is careful to add that Lucifer's rape "failed"-for, he notes, Lucifer's power was not equal to his will- he does concede, several lines further down, that irreparable damage was indeed done to God's kingdom: thwarted in his attempt to seize heaven's throne, Lucifer did, nevertheless, succeed in violating heaven. Rossetti discusses a new interpretation advanced by Grassi Torinese, according to which "strupo" was derived from the late Latin "stropus," meaning flock, but acknowl- edges that he, at least, is by no means ready to discard the old gloss; the new interpretation strikes him as ingenious, the old, profound (DDPRossetti [1826-27], 10- Inf). From this time on, the commentators often present both of these interpretations but, like Rossetti, tend to favor the old interpretation-which, however, has lost much of its sexual valence and is usually expressed in such abstract terms as "rebellion" or "act of violence against God." Though the late-Latin derivation of "strupo" from "stropus" has been duly discarded (see Domenico Consoli's brief article in the Enciclopedia dantesca and Parodi's article in the Bull. Soc. Dant., III, 115ff and XXIII, 18), the sexual violence so clearly conveyed by Dante's word "strupo" has yet to be reclaimed. 13 Citation from Dante Alighieri, Opere minori. Convivio, ed. Cesare Vasoli and Domenico de Robertis (Milano: Ricciardo Ricciardi, 1995).

How Dante arrived at the figure of one-tenth for the number of fallen angels remains a mystery. 10</page><page sequence="11">M L N It is not by happenstance that this powerful notion of Lucifer's rape is introduced precisely in canto seven for it signals, in no uncertain terms, the transition from the salvific "rape" from limbo by a compassionate god to the punitive "rape" inflicted upon Lucifer and his fellow mutineers by a vengeful god in retaliation for the "superbo strupo." Dante's use of the periphrasis "da ciel piovuti" (VIII, 83) in canto eight to describe the intransigent devils that guard the gate of Dite serves to remind us that these overzealous janitors are those very angels who banded together with Lucifer in history's first attempted coup d'6tat; the celestial emissary's use of the near identical periphra- sis "cacciati del ciel" (IX, 91) to refer to these same devils in the following canto serves to further underscore this association. The archangel Michael's "revenge"-his expulsion of Lucifer and his troops-tends to obscure the fact that Lucifer did succeed both in his "rape" and in his despoliation of heaven. While the immediate "vendetta" for Lucifer's "strupo" is his rapid expulsion from heaven by Michael, the long-term "vendetta" for his depredation of the angelic host is Christ's retaliatory depredation of hell: the abduction of hell's most prized possession-the souls of the patriarchs, proph- ets, and other messianic Jews. The validity of this pattern of rape and counter-rape in the Commedia is confirmed by the periphrasis for Christ in which he is described as: ". . . colui che la gran preda / lev6 a Dite del cerchio superno" (Inf. XII, 38-39).14 It is one thing to accuse Lucifer of having perpetrated a "superbo strupo," quite another to suggest that Christ undertakes a retaliatory rape. However, just as the word "strupo" implies the existence of a sexual victim, the use of the word "preda" in the preceding passage implies the presence of a "raptor," and cannot help but evoke the constellation of ideas related to abduction and sexual violation. Though the "preda" (the liberated souls of limbo) most certainly share the Archipoeta's opinion that "ubi deus raptor est, dulcis est rapina," Lucifer and his 14 This model of a predatory Christ is by no means original to Dante, but is found in many earlier discussions of the harrowing. In the Pseudo-Augustine Sermo 160, we are told that Jesus snatches from the "cloister" of hell those souls whose faith and acts reveal them to be his own: "illos ex inferni claustris rapuit, quos suos in fide et actibus recognovit" (De Pascha, PL 39: 2059-61). Vincent de Beauvais writes that Christ carries the just out of hell "quasi victor praedam per medios raptores" (Speculum historiale, 1624; rpt. Graz: Akademische Druck-und Verlagsanstalt, 1965, bk. 7, chap. 49). The language here is strongly reminiscent of that used by Dante's Piccarda to describe her abduction by evil men: "fuor mi rapiron de la dolce chiostra" (Par. III, 107). However, as is so often the case in Dante, this superficial similarity is designed to disclose the underlying difference. 11</page><page sequence="12">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES minions are left to wail and gnash their teeth, anguished by the loss of their most prized possession.'5 While it is clear how Christ's retrieval of the limbo-dwellers corresponds to this pattern of a retaliatory depredation, it requires a bit more effort to see how the strange drama enacted in front of Dite's closed portal in cantos eight and nine fits into this same pattern. As I have already suggested, Dante appears to subscribe to Albert's and Thomas's distinction between Christ "in presence" and Christ "in power." One of the most obvious dividends of this cleavage is that Dante's Christ, like many a seasoned temporal prince, is able to administer his acts of compassion in person, his punishments, by proxy (in "power"): a politically shrewd arrangement indeed!16 The compassionate retrieval of the marooned souls of limbo that was carried out by Christ "in person" is represented by Virgil's terse account in Inferno IV; Christ's punitive, seismic, penetration of hell "in power" that accompanied the Crucifixion is recapitulated in minia- ture by the haughty celestial emissary who arrives with a deafening sonic roar that sets the banks of the Styx atremble ("tremavano amendue le sponde" [Inf. IX, 66]), disdainfully opens the doors of Dite with a touch of his wand, and impatiently heads back to attend to more pressing concerns. Castelvetro voices concern with regard to the verisimilitude of the physical phenomena-the fracas and trem- bling earth-that are described as proceeding from the messo's arrival: Ma io non veggo come la venuta dell'angelo dovesse far cosi gran romore, non venendo ne con tromba ne gridando, ed andando sopra l'acqua, e non la toccando apena o pur non la toccando, dovendo far tremare ambedue le sponde della palude stigia, essendo tanto lontana l'una dall'altra, che non si potevano vedere per vista d'uomo, come s'e veduto. (DDP Castelvetro [1570], Inf. 9.64-67) While it is easy enough to dismiss such qualms as the misbegotten fruit of an empiricist's naive attempt to apply the laws of science to divine phenomena, Castelvetro's concern does, nevertheless, do much to frame the basic problem; there is an undeniable incongruity 15 From Vagabond Verse: Secular Latin Poems of the Middle Ages, trans. Edwin H. Zeydel (Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1966) 256. 16 This desire to distance Christ from the less palatable aspects of divinejudgment no doubt also accounts for Dante's strange reticence concerning what is, after the famous inscription, no doubt the most conspicuous feature of the great portals of hell: the unhinged doors. It is here-rather than in Inferno III-that Virgil first mentions the "punitive" unhinging of hell's great doors. 12</page><page sequence="13">M L N between the anonymous messo-equipped not with a battering ram but a frond-and the powerful effect that he has on his surroundings. Why, indeed, does Dante make such a point of emphasizing the trembling of the two banks, "sponde," of the Styx provoked by this terrifying fracas and liken this effect to that produced by an impetu- ous wind, driven by "aversi ardori" that tears through a forest, carrying off broken branches?17 Evidently, he would like to impress upon his readers the violent, invasive quality of this advent of the messo. Certainly, the powerful tremors produced by this descent seem deliberately calculated to recall the universal trembling of hell produced at the time of Christ's crucifixion-Christ's descent "in power." That this aloof celestial entity is no more than an agent or instrument of divine power is clear from his entirely generic quality, his utter lack of distinguishing features. Indeed, even the customary use of the word "messo" to identify the celestial being is misleading, for Dante only identifies him with the periphrasis "da ciel messo" (Inf. IX, 85)-one in which "messo" is not a noun, but a participle.'8 The universal impasse encountered by critics in their age-old effort to reach a consensus regarding the identity of the messo only confirms the essentially abstract quality of this celestial envoy who plunges into hell, forces open the doors of Dite, and upbraids its custodians. What are we to make of the strange fact that the instrument used to force an entry through the doors of Dite is not, as one might logically expect, a variety of battering ram, but a supple wand, "verghetta"?: "Venne a la porta e con una verghetta / l'aperse, che non v'ebbe alcun ritegno" (Inf: IX, 89-90).19 The use of a diminutive derived 17 These verses do not merely evoke the familiar narrative of the harrowing, but conceal, under a "scientific," Aristotelian, veneer the paradoxical doctrine that divine punishment-so often figured as a destructive wind (as, for instance, in the Book of Job)-is fuelled not by hatred, but by love in conflict with itself, "awersi ardori." Note that Dante does not explicitly link the ominous fracas to the celestial emissary's arrival. However, a review of the commentaries suggests that Guido alone associates the noise with the arrival of Medusa: "non erat aliud nisi illa male dicta Medusa" (DDP Guido [1327-28], Inf: 9, 64-65). The idea of a wind rape is, like that of a water rape, very ancient; Ovid describes the rape of Chloris, Mother of Flowers, by the wind god Zephyr in his Fasti (V, 195-204), and in his Amores we read of the river god Anio who shared conjugal rights to Rhea who, in despair, has thrown herself into his waters (Ovid, Amores, III, vi, 79). 18 See Silvio Pasquazi's entry for "messo celeste" in the Enciclopedia dantesca (vol. 3, pp. 919-21) for an overview of the critical debate surrounding the figure of this emissary. 19 There is, furthermore, an amusing irony underlying this whole episode that has not, to my knowledge, been observed. Concerning the origin of Virgil's name, the 13</page><page sequence="14">1TOBIAS FOSTER GIl TES from virga stresses the pliancy of this wand while suggesting the inherently sexual nature of the forced opening; like Bacchus's equally flexible thyrsus, or Aeneas's golden bough, the fateful "virga" of Aeneid VI, 409, the power of this wand is not intrinsic but derives rather from its function as a symbol of divine authority.20 This compelling image of a violent penetration of the third kingdom is found, in somewhat altered form, in the periphrasis used by Virgil to invoke the figure of Amphiarus: "cui / s'aperse a li occhi d'i Teban la terra" (Inf. XX, 32). The earth is opened to the eyes of the Thebans as the seer Amphiarus disappears into a crater that springs open beneath his feet, carrying him directly to Hades. Statius, Dante's primary source for this episode, describes Amphiarus's an- tagonistic reception by Pluto who, shaken by the violent disruption of his gloomy realm, rails against that unknown person who, like Pirithous, Theseus, and Hercules before him, has dared to profane his realm (Thebaid VIII, 34-56).21 This motif of a profanation of the underworld is at least as old as Homer (whose Aidoneus is terrified that Poseidon will cleave the earth, exposing the dreadful houses of the dead to men and gods alike [Iliad XX, 61-65]), becomes indissolubly connected with the theme of sexual rape in the ancient myth of Proserpina's abduction by Hades (familiar to Dante in the popular version by Ovid [Met. V, 385ff]), and resurges, grotesquely, in Virgil's description of Hercules's violent "rape" of Cacus's ghastly lair in Aeneid VIII, 239-46 (Jean de Meun apparently found the latent sexuality of this Vergilian episode so compelling that he was moved to author of the Ottimo commentary observes: "Ed ebbe nome Virgilio; per6 che la madre essendo in lui gravida, sogn6 ch'ella partoriva una verga, che toccava il Cielo" (DDP Ottimo [1333], Purg. 7.16-18). This association of Virgil with "verga" is made in several of the early autobiographies of Virgil and was no doubt familiar to Dante; it can scarcely be coincidental that in this Dite episode Dante juxtaposes the conspicuous failure of a personified "virga," Virgil, to achieve with a strenuous effort what a diminutive virga-the verghetta of the celestial emissary-accomplishes with ease. 20 The use of the noun "virga" as a euphemism for penis was widespread in Latin texts of the Middle Ages. See for example William of Conches's Dragmaticon or Chapter 31 of Vincent de Beauvais's Speculum naturale. According to Pierrugues (Glossarium eroticum linguae Latinae [Paris: Dondey-Dupr6, Bibliopolas, 1826]) the classical Latin diminutive for "virga," "virgula" (one corresponding to Dante's "verghetta"), also denotes "penis." 21 Pluto finishes his diatribe against violators of his realm by pointing out that his only unlawful sally into the realm of the living was his abduction of Proserpina; certainly, he concludes, as he has already been amply punished for this small act of violence there can be no justification for the profanation to which he is now being subjected (note the implicit theme of a retaliatory rape). 14</page><page sequence="15">M L N draw the awkward, and profoundly unsettling, analogy between the sexual conquest of the rose and the violent disclosure of Cacus's secret lair by Hercules [Roman de la rose 21623ff]) .22 Finally, Aidoneus's ancient lament rings clear in the words pronounced by Inferus, the personified Hell of the Descensus Christi, who, upon hearing the thunderous voice of an approaching Christ, wails: "That voice was nothing else than the cry of the Son of the Father most high because the earth and all the places of the world below so trembled under it: wherefore I think that myself and all my dungeons now lie exposed" (Latin B, 3 [19] .I.).23 Common to these passages is the keen sense of a violation of privacy, an exposure to the scathing light of the upper world and penetrating gaze of the living, a trembling (both of the earth and of the shadows hidden in its bosom), and an overwhelming sense that this invasion is abhorrent to the skulking shades. In constructing his own underworld model, Dante was able to exploit not only this complex linkage of the descent motif with the physical violation of a person-or personified realm-so widely attested in classical texts, but could also draw on the profoundly misogynist (and extremely influential) association of female anatomy with the underworld facilitated by the author of Proverbs 30:24 tria sunt insaturabilia et quartum quod numquam dicit sufficit infernus et os vulvae et terra quae non satiatur aqua ignis vero numquam dicit sufficit (Proverbs 30, 15-16) By lumping hell, the "womb's mouth," and earth together beneath the damning rubric of insatiability, the author of these lines paves the way for an endless succession of invidious comparisons. This femi- nized underworld is not cast as the hapless victim of an external 22 Since Dante had almost certainly read the Roman de la rose and perhaps even written "II fiore," an Italian "digest" of the Roman, it is likely that he was familiar with Jean's feminization of Cacus's lair. In his account of the Four Ages (Metamorphoses I, 137-40), Ovid presents the penetration of the earth's viscera in search of mineral wealth as a variety of rape. For a scientific treatment of this same theme, see Pliny's Natural History XXXIII II, 63. 23 The Apocryphal New Testament, trans. J. K. Elliott (New York: Oxford UP, 1993). 24 Unless otherwise noted, all quotations from the Vulgate are from the Biblia sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem, 3rd ed., ed.

The rod of discipline- "virga disciplinae"-is recommended as a means of rescuing those wayward youths who have already fallen into the "deep mouth of a stranger": "profunda os alienae cui iratus / est Dominus incidet in eam / stultitia conligata est in corde pueri / et virga disciplinae fugabit eam" (14-15). These same themes reemerge in Proverb 23 where we are told that this deep mouth, "fovea profunda," represents a prostitute ("fovea enim profunda est meretrix" [27]), and that the rod, "virga," saves youths from hell: "noli subtrahere a puero disci- plinam / si enim percusseris eum virga non / morietur / tu virga percuties eum et animam eius / de inferno liberabis" (13-14). All of these passages liken the straying from the right path to a communion with prostitutes associated with perdition. Additionally, the corrective measure generally advocated is the application of a "virga disciplinae"; it is the duty of pedagogues to inculcate such discipline in their pupils. Perhaps the messo's "verghetta" is intended to recall this "virga disciplinae." Certainly, the association of the episode at the doors of Dite with the harrowing is strengthened by the identification in Proverb 23 of the virga as a means of securing freedom from hell ("tu virga percuties eum et animam eiusde inferno liberabis"), and the equally fitting role of the virga as an instrument of discipline. This would also account for the messo's almost incongruously pedantic- and heavy-handed-upbraiding of the devils of Dite; the confronta- tion between the messo and the devils is not only a sacra rappresentazione, but portrays an all too familiar secular drama: the eternal agon between pedagogue and profligate. Virgil himself unwittingly abets this unwholesome conflation of 25 Tertullian's vituperative pronouncement that woman (ever since Eve) is the devil's door-"Tu es diaboli janua, tu es arboris illius resignatrix, tu es divinae legis prima desertrix . . ." (De cultu feminarum, PL, vol. 1, col. 1305)-would, though purely metaphorical, have done much to shore up this implied connection between the carnal "os vulvae" and the geologic door to hell. 16</page><page sequence="17">M L N infernal portals with female anatomy, metaphysics with physics, through his sententious description of Dis in the Aeneid-"facilis descensus Averno: / noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis" (VI, 126- 27)-whose door, open night and day, calls to mind such famously free-swinging bedroom doors as that of Horace's lovely Lydia (Odes I, 25), thereby inviting endless analogies between the antechamber of hell and the bedchamber. In The Art of Courtly Love, for instance, Andreas Capellanus has a noblewoman repulse her suitor's advances with the warning that the "court of love" may be fittingly compared to "the court of hell, for although the door of hell stands open for all who wish to enter, there is no way of getting out after you are once in" (fifth dialogue, chap. 6, p. 71).26 In Boccaccio's misogynistic reprise of this Vergilian motif in the Corbaccio, Andreas's playful, courtly simile-the court of love which is like the court of hell-cedes to the dark certainty that carnal love, an erotic labyrinth, is hell: a place easily entered through folly and lascivious desire, but nearly impos- sible to leave except through ingenuity and strength: "quantunque l'entrare di questo luogo sia apertissimo a chi vuole entrarci con lascivia e con matezza, egli non &amp; cosi agevole ill riuscirne; ma e faticoso e conviensi fare e con senno e con fortezza" (52). Moreover, the association of the court of hell with female anatomy that is only implicit in Andreas's text becomes all too evident in Boccaccio's subsequent elaboration of this "voragine infernale" (Corbaccio, 292ff): a thinly disguised, and thoroughly caustic, representation of the female genitalia.27 The superficial similarity of the expressions used to describe the infernal portals of Dis in the Aeneid ("facilis descensus Averno: / noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis") and of hell in the Commedia ("la porta / lo cui sogliare a nessuno e negato" [Inf XIV, 86-87]) belies a fundamental difference. In the Aeneid, the door is available to all; in the Commedia, the door is denied to none. The idea that the door is denied to none implies that admittance to the door is 26John Jay Parry's translation from The Art of Courtly Love (New York: Columbia UP, 1960). 27 This delight in exploiting the ambivalent characteristics of the erotic portal, a threshold to paradisal pleasures or infernal punishments, is already evident in Ovid's erotic poetry. In the Amores, a text where no doorway is innocent of erotic nuance, Ovid describes a frustrated lover who upbraids the doors that have repeatedly blocked his passage: "Not you were the one to be given ward of my beautiful lady-love's threshold; you were fit only to guard a gloomy dungeon" (Amores I, vi. 63-64, trans. Grant Showerman, Loeb ed.). For another instance of this metaphor in the Amores see II, i, 17ff. 17</page><page sequence="18">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES customarily petitioned-a motif commonly encountered in erotic poetry, where the door to the boudoir often represents, by metonymy, the beloved's genitalia.28 If Dante's Virgil can speak of hell's portal as "la porta / lo cui sogliare a nessuno &amp; negato" it is not because their divine architect forgot to install a lock, but because the bolt, "serrame," was broken and the doors violently wrenched from their hinges by Christ in the course of his harrowing (Inf. VIII, 124-25); hell's promiscuity is not elective, but punitive.29 A voice seems to issue from the portal of hell: "Per me si va ne la citta dolente, / Per me si va ne l'etterno dolore .. ." (Inf. III, 1-2). As Guido da Pisa observes in his commentary: "porta ipsa loquitur omnibus per eam intrantibus" (56).30 In anthropomorphosizing the infernal archi- tecture of hell's portal, Dante is inverting the image, familiar from the gospel of John, of Jesus as a salvific gate ("ego sum ostium / per me si quis introierit salvabitur . ." [John 10: 9, emphasis mine]), one that he uses in glossing the tabernacle door of Leviticus: "The door of the tabernacle is a figurative expression for Christ, who is the door of our eternal dwelling, as the Gospels say" (De monarchia II, 7).31 It is precisely 28 Indeed, the use of the architectural portal as a surrogate for the genitals is a commonplace in biblical, classical, and medieval literature. Consider, for instance, the Song of Songs, where we read of the lover who knocked at the "door" of his beloved and then "thrust his hand into the opening" (5;4) and the memorable refrain of Ovid's lover in the Amores who pleads: "The hours of the night are going; away with the bar from the door" (I, vi, 31-32, trans. Grant Showerman, Loeb ed.). The well-garrisoned erotic hortus conclusus of the Roman de la rose may only be entered through a door that is "petitet et estroit" (513-18, and the climactic moment of the allegory-the taking of the rose-follows Solomon's precedent in the Song of Songs by translating erogenous zones into architectural elements. One of the redeeming dividends of this otherwise awkward use of erotic metaphor is that the sexual conquest-the passage of the lover's staff between the "columns" that stand before his beloved's "sanctuary"-seems to deliberately travesty the epicjourney between the columns of Hercules. The Roman also provides an example of the orifice as dungeon; the embattlements built by Jealousy which are equipped with four doors, each with its own sliding portcullis-a treacherous contraption designed to punish foolhardy suitors (3828). An even more elaborate doorway, replete with latches, levers and bars, is to be found in the description of the allegorical "cave of lovers" in Gottfried's Tristan (a cave which is itself a reminiscence of the cave where Aeneas and Dido consummate their "marriage" in Aeneid IV). 29 Significantly, this prominent rupture in the fabric of hell-one that effectively renders it a "hortus apertus"-does not heal. By contrast, the wound of sin in God's creation that was introduced by Eve, "colei [Eve] che l'aperse e che la punse" (Par. XXXII, 6) is healed and annointed by Mary-"la piaga che Maria richiuse e unse" (Par. XXXII, 4)-who exemplifies the "hortus conclusus." 30 Guido da Pisa, Expositiones et glose super comediam Dantis or Commentary on Dante's Inferno, ed. Vincenzo Cioffari (Albany: State U of New York P, 1974). 3' A brief perusal of the Dartmouth Dante Project data base suggests that this association with the salvific "ostium" of lohn has not been addressed. 18</page><page sequence="19">M L N through this personified gate that Jesus, according to Dante's model, passes on his way to limbo. Here, the part must be taken for the whole; the gate of hell is hell, for it marks the place where hell begins, hell's initial orifice, and one that resisted-uselessly-Christ's entrance. Here, the anthropomorphic qualities of the architectural "orifice" imply the penetration of a biological orifice. Whereas the Middle Ages identifies Christ, the salvific "ostium," with the church door (a metaphor occasionally literalized in the sculptural programs of church tympana and trumeaux), the ever- open door of perdition is, by the usual system of contraries so dear to the Middle Ages, the door to the whorehouse. In Proverbs, the prostitute-or loose woman-looms large as a sort of foil for Wisdom, and her home, in contrast to the seven-pillared house of Wisdom (a metaphoric temple of knowledge), is figured as a passage to hell: "viae inferi domus eius penetrantes interiora mortis" (Prov., 7.27).32 In his De disciplina scholarium, Boethius likewise associates the prosti- tute with (among other unsavory things) the portal of hell: "Est autem meretrix nonaria infernijanua" (PL, 64, col. 1227-28).33 Castelvetro notes the uncanny similarities between the immortal words "lasciate ogni speranza" inscribed on Dante's infernal doors and the largely forgotten plea of the pedagogue Lydus in Plautus's Bacchides, who, having traced his truant pupil to a brothel, addresses these plaintive words to the shut doors: 32 See also Proverbs 9.18. 33 In one of Augustine's (dubious) sermons, Sermo CCCLXIV, concerning the story of Samson found in Judges 16.1-3-where Samson visits a prostitute in Gaza and apparently avoids an ambush by the Gazites by uprooting the city gates and depositing them on a hilltop in front of Hebron-hell is explicitly compared to a whorehouse. The author of the sermon, noting the strangeness of Samson's acts, poses the inevitable question, "Quid es hoc?" Inspired by Proverb 30, he answers: "Infernum et amorem mulieris, utrumque Scriptura conjungit. Inferni imaginem tenebat domus meretricis. Recte pro inferis ponitur: quia neminem repellit, et omnem intrantem ad se trahit (Prov. 30, 16)" (Sermo CCCLXIV, 4). In the gloss that follows it becomes clear that Samson is to be understood as a figure of Christ, the whorehouse as hell, and the removal of the city gates as a harrowing of hell: "Tollit tamen portas civitatis, id est, aufert portas inferni. Quid est portas inferni tollere, nisi mortis imperium removere? Recipiebat enim et non remittebat. Quid autem fecit Dominus nosterJesus Christus? Ablatis portis mortis, ascendit in cacumen montis" (Sermo CCCLXIV, 4). In this gloss of Judges 16, we find a confluence of motifs that are united once again in Dante's incident at the doors of Dite; the conquest of death through a sexualized harrowing. If Dante's lower hell is a whorehouse, Medusa is its madam and the notoriously insatiable Furies stand waiting for customers. 19</page><page sequence="20">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES Open up, for god's sake, quickly, fling them wide, these gates of Hell. How can I regard them other? Nobody sets foot in here, Only those who've quite abandoned hopes of living useful lives. (Bacchides III, I, 2)34 In a footnote to his Studies in Dante, the nineteenth-century scholar Edward Moore observes the remarkable resemblance of these two texts and allows that while there is no evidence that Dante had an immediate acquaintance with any of Plautus's works, he may have encountered this particular passage "in a Florilegium" (276, note 2).35 Tantalizing as this possibility is, it is by no means indispensable to the more general thesis that the "dolenti case" of lower hell have much in common with the more secular, and often no less sorrowful, houses of ill-repute. Given that Christ the "bridegroom" enjoys, according to a trope common in the Middle Ages, a spiritual union with the Church, it should come as no surprise that Christ, the retaliatory rapist, inflicts a physical punishment on the bordello-a virtual "anti-church"-of lower hell. In the Descensus Christi ad inferos, we read that Inferos trembles with dread as "the gates of death and the bolts" are shattered and his realm is "exposed" by the conquering Christ (8 [24]. I.). By personi- fying Hell, and thereby endowing the inanimate underworld with human form and feeling, the author of the Descensus Christi renders the truly supernatural notion of a harrowing of hell in the most natural, familiar terms conceivable; Inferus's anguish is not only the anguish experienced by a person whose home has been forcibly entered, for his home, Inferus, is identical with his body, and the invasion, therefore, is indistinguishable from a sexual rape. While Dante does not actually personify hell-for this is the stuff of miracle plays, not miracles-he does, I would argue, achieve a similar (though infinitely more powerful) effect by infusing the inanimate fabric of hell with forms and functions that deliberately mimic human physiology. The same overriding concern with verisimilitude that prompts Dante to temper the rigid symmetries of his otherworld through a 34 "Pandite atque aperite propere ianuam hanc Orci, obsecro. Nam equidem haud aliter esse duco: quippe quoi nemo advenit, Nisi quem spes reliquere omnes ex se ut frui possiet" (Bacchides III, I, 2).

The Phlegethon, like a swollen vein, carries boiling blood in lieu of water, the second valley of Malebolge's corrugated funnel brims, like a burst intestine, with human excre- ment, the pooled tears of the Old Man of Crete (a metal colossus most often glossed as an embodiment of sinful humanity) form the frozen lake of Coccitus. Like an eternally suppurating carcass, hell is completely awash with bodily secretions, each of which represents the perversion of its life-sustaining cognate. Here, scalding blood circu- lates around, not within the flesh; excrement clings to the body, punishing eyes and nose with its acrid stench; and tears, no longer warm, subvert their usual cathartic role by binding sinners in their glacial embrace. While this combining of somatic and artificial features has the general effect of subtly anthropomorphizing hell, I would argue that this eerie enfleshment takes on a distinctly female- gynecomorphic-cast at the portal of Dite, with the result that the metaphoric "rape" of hell suddenly acquires a strongly biological, visceral character. Upon arrival at the gates of Dite, Virgil requests a secret conference with the devil-custodians who seek to bar his entrance. This repre- sents the only time that Virgil sees fit to exclude Dante from the oft- repeated process of petitioning access to a new circle and is, perhaps not coincidentally, the only instance in which such access is denied. As a rule, Virgil invokes divine authority in a formula first used to overcome Charonte's resistance: "vuolsi cosi cola dove si puote / ci6 che si vuole, e piu non dimandare" (Inf. III, 96). Here, strangely, he seems to disavow this authority by petitioning for, rather than simply demanding, an entrance-as though divine authority were subject to negotiation! Having failed in his attempts to negotiate an entrance with the devil custodians of Dite, Virgil states "Pur a noi converra vincer la punga" (Inf. IX, 7), words that highlight the violence of the imminent contest. This notion that the failed negotiations have resulted in the necessity of forcing an entrance is reiterated shortly afterwards: "non potemo intrare omai sanz'ira" (Inf. IX, 33). Though the sexual metaphor which casts woman as a castle besieged by suitors is a commonplace in the erotic literature of the classical world and Middle Ages (it is the metaphor that underpins the whole of the Roman de la rose) Dante's systematic conflation of the architectural 21</page><page sequence="22">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES fabric of his Dite with the most misogynist variety of "female" attributes represents the infernal, and profoundly unsettling, travesty of this traditional theme. Indeed, the doorway of Dite, at first no more than an architectural abstraction, the indistinct place indicated by Flegias when he says "qui e l'intrata" (Inf. VIII, 81), is rapidly transformed into a dynamic, profoundly feminine site of a sort of "black" apotheosis when the infernal sisterhood of bloodstained Furies suddenly appears above it. Before providing their names, Dante makes a point of emphasizing their gender in a strangely generic, impersonal phrase: "membra feminine avieno e atto" (Inf. IX, 39). Since the Furies familiar to Dante from the texts of Virgil, Ovid, and Statius consistently repre- sent the most savage and threatening aspect of the female sex, this observation that the Furies have "membra feminine" appears to be entirely gratuitous. However, the implication that the Furies' breasts and genitals are visible (what else could be intended by "female body parts"?) and the substitution of a slender snake girdle ("con idre verdissime eran cinte" Inf. IX, 40) for the gore-bespattered garments described by the Roman poets ("palla succinta cruenta" Aeneid VI, 555; "fluidoque cruore rubentem / induitur pallam" Metamorphoses IV, 482-83; "riget horrida tergo/palla" Thebaid I, 109) suggest a striking departure from the classical iconography: Dante's Furies are apparently naked. Certainly, this is the inference drawn by the thirteenth and fourteenth century illuminators of this episode who, with few exceptions, depict the Furies naked with snakes twined about their breasts, heads, and waists. The Furies' nudity does much to reinforce the "female" qualities of the tower and door with which they are so closely identified (this implicit union of flesh and stone is best captured by those illustrations which depict the Furies emerging, from the waist up, from the tower's crown, with their lower halves suggestively concealed behind the tower's single door).36 The asser- 36 For images of the naked Furies see Brieger, Meiss and Singleton's Illuminated Manuscripts of the Divine Comedy (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1969). Benvenuto attempts to explain this emphasis on gender as being in keeping with the medieval tendency to use women when personifying such abstract concepts as virtue and vice, and because women (and here he invokes the authority of Aristotle) are as a gender notable for the extremity of their emotions: "Et hic nota quod autor dat sexum foemineum furiis, sicut etiam vicia et virtutes repraesentantur in habitu foeminino, similter et scientiae, quia sunt foeminini generis, et quia ut dicit philosophus: mulier facit omnia valde: si diligit, diligit intense; et ita si odit, odit immense" (DDP Benvenuto [1373], Inf. 9.34-39). However, had Dante's intention been that of identifying gender alone, there would have been no need to dwell on physiological distinctions-"membra feminine." 22</page><page sequence="23">M L N tion that their manner, "atto," too was feminine is somewhat mysteri- ous. In any case, theirs is a dark femininity so deeply rooted in both member and gesture that it is muted by neither the stain of blood nor the startling green of the serpents by which they are entwined. Immediately following this description, the Furies are described by the periphrasis, "le meschine de la regina de l'etterno pianto" (Inf: IX, 43-44). The "regina" in question is none other than Proserpina, and the Furies are her servants, "meschine." Thus far, lower hell has been presented as a fortified city presided over by a queen, Proserpina (whose name is practically synonymous with the idea of underworld abductions) and defended by a legion of fallen angels marshaled by the Furies. Since the Furies figure prominently in Virgil's Aeneid, it is only natural that Dante's Virgil is quick to recognize-and identify by name-the three Furies who, apparently enraged by this disclosure, invoke the specter of Medusa: "Vegna Medusa: si '1 farem di smalto" (Inf IX, 52). The notable parallels among this episode at the gates of Dite, the Sibyl's account of Tartarus in Aeneid VI, and the harrowing narrative in the Gospel ofNicodemus serve to highlight the emphatically feminine quality of Dante's entrance to lower hell. Where we would expect to hear mention of Hades, we hear instead of his wife Proserpina; where we would expect to hear the name of Lucifer, hell's prince, we hear instead the name of Medusa; where we would expect to hear of Rhadamanthus, the infernal judge of Tartarus (Aeneid VI, 566), we hear only of the Furies-who, moreover, are no longer represented by Tisiphone alone, but have burgeoned into a gruesome trinity. Whereas Proserpina's suitability as a female correlate for Hades is self-evident, it is less clear to the contemporary reader what Medusa and Lucifer have in common. Mythological sources agree that Medusa's otherworldly beauty was transformed to an equally prodi- gious ugliness as a divine punishment.37 According to one version current in the Middle Ages, when Medusa presumptuously dared to compare her gifts to those of Minerva, the latter deftly resolved the dispute by transforming Medusa into the familiar squamous horror- a narrative that has truly striking parallels to the story of Lucifer. 37 There is disagreement concerning the nature of Medusa's transgression. Accord- ing to another version (based on Perseus's account in Ovid's Metamorphoses [IV, 790- 803]), Medusa is raped by Neptune in a temple dedicated to Minerva and the latter, enraged by this desecration, recurs to the usual benighted strategy of further punishing the victim. 23</page><page sequence="24">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES Lucifer is described by Dante as the "creatura ch'ebbe il bel sembiante" (Inf. XXXIV, 18) who, "S'el fu si bel com'elli e ora brutto" (34), is fittingly the source of all sadness. Like Medusa's, his fall from privilege to punishment is physically manifested by the acquisition of an ugliness as extraordinary as his original beauty had been. In short, a medieval author attempting to come up with a female Lucifer would, it seems to me, naturally gravitate towards the figure of Medusa. Moreover, both Satan and Medusa are credited with super- natural powers of seduction which both enlist in their eternal crusade to prey on humanity. In his commentary on the Commedia, Guido da Pisa cites Peter Comestor's characterization of Medusa as a whore who uses her powers of seduction to render her admirers impotent: "Perseus Gorgonam occidit meretricem, que ob nimiam pulchritudinem speculatores suos mentes impotentes reddebat."38 Though Guido does not ignore this component of sensual seduction he is no more inclined to gaze upon this spectre of medusan sensuality than Dante, and therefore immediately sets about veiling these dangerous "mem- bra feminine" in allegory. With a few strokes of his pen, Guido transforms the insolent, menacing Furies of Dite into such didactic abstractions as the depravity of heresy "heretice pravitatis" (175), or three appetites that afflict men: "ira, che vindictam cupit; cupiditas, que desiderat opes; libido, que appetit voluptates" (181). The center- piece of this assemblage of female squalor, Medusa herself, is revealed to be terror and oblivion "terroris et oblivionis" (175). 38 From Guido da Pisa's Expositiones et glose super comediam, ed. V. Cioffari. Peter Comestor's characterization of Medusa as a whore draws upon a tradition at least as ancient as Isidore of Seville, who refers to the Gorgon sisters as "meretrices" in his enormously influential Etymologies (PL, vol. 82, col. 422). Many early commentators concur in viewing Dante's Medusa as an allegory of oblivion. John Freccero has argued that because recent criticism has been so occupied with distinguishing the variety of allegory applied by Dante in the Commedia (according to Singleton, the "allegory of theologians") from that commonly used by poets in composing their incredible myths and dramatic metamorphoses (the "allegory of poets"), when confronted with the Medusa episode, their primary concern has been to account for this apparently aberrant eruption of the allegory of poets within the overriding theological allegory. Freccero attempts to resolve this difficulty by arguing that the Medusa episode is, despite its superficial affinities with the allegory of poets, an essentially theological allegory which serves to dramatize the conversion experience: the aversion from Medusa, who represents the threat of seduction by temporal things (hence the strange urgency to shield Dante's eyes from the sight of Medusa), and conversion to Christian truth. He associates Medusa with the "God of this world," who, he notes, is identified with the devil by later tradition-an argument supported by the analogies that I have highlighted between the tales accounting for their respective physical transformations. 24</page><page sequence="25">M L N John Frecrero has noted the strange reticence of the traditional glosses of Da ite's Medusa concerning "what to a modern reader is most obvious: whatever the horror the Medusa presents to the male imagination, it is in some sense a female horror" (102).39 Whereas Guido sets himself the task of domesticating this dangerous sensuality through didactic allegories, Freccero reverses this procedure by revealing the inescapably erotic nature of the encounter. The Furies' menacing reference to Theseus's assault-"Mal non vengiammo in Teseo l'assalto" (Inf IX, 54), an allusion, Freccero believes (and Guido makes the same observation), to Theseus's harebrained scheme to procure a divine wife for his friend Pirithous by plucking Proserpina from her underworld throne, "helps to identify the subject matter as specifically erotic and literary, rather than abstractly moral" (103). "The point," Freccero continues, "is that the descent had for its objective the abduction of Persephone; it was therefore an erotic, not to say sexual, assault" (103).40 Freccero goes on to suggest that this erotic assault on a fallen Persephone is a dark reflection of Dante's own search for "a pre-lapsarian Persephone" (103), a return to erotic innocence which is fulfilled, if not wholly, at least in part, in his later encounter in Eden with Matelda (who is explicitly associated with Proserpina [Purg. XXVIII, 49-51]). This intriguing thesis does not, however, address the far more immediate question that concerns me here: does Dante's and Virgil's forceful entry into lower hell, one that Dante explicitly links with Theseus's erotic assault, retain any of this erotic quality? My own answer would, of course, be a resounding 39 Citations are from Freccero's essay "Medusa" in Dante, the Modern Critical Views anthology of critical essays ed. by Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1986). Freccero's essay was originally published in Yearbook of Italian Studies, 1972. 40 Whereas the Furies proclaim their intention of retaliating for Theseus's forced entrance by summoning Medusa, the celestial emissary reminds them that their last foolhardy attempt to foil a harrowing had dire results; Cerberus was partially skinned and Theseus (among others) saved. What better representation of the physiological consequences of rape than the image of a flayed throat-one that serves synecdochi- cally to represent the physical humiliation inflicted upon hell, itself a geological "throat" ("fauces" in Aeneid VI, 201), in the course of such harrowings. The depiction of hell as a mouth is a medieval commonplace. See for example Gary D. Schmidt, The Iconography of the Mouth of Hell (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna UP, 1995) and The Iconogra- phy of Hell, ed. Clifford Davidson and Thomas H. Seiler (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992).This passage is much disputed. See "I1 mito di Teseo e il cristianesimo di Stazio" in Giorgio Padoan's II pio Enea l'empio Ulisse: tradizione classica e intendimento medievale in Dante (Ravenna: Longo, 1977).

Indeed, Dante's hell is a place of "deflowering," just as the terrestrial paradise (where Matelda gathers blossoms) is a place of "re-floration," and paradise is the place of (a projected) floral plenitude-the Candida rosa whose angelic population, devastated by Lucifer's "stupro," will be fully restored with repristinated human souls at the end of time. In concluding this article, I would like to direct the reader's attention once again to the portal of hell. When Dante first encoun- ters the "scritta morta" (Inf. VIII, 127) inscribed in hell's portal, he is ill-equipped to understand it. Like Aeneas marveling at the images of his great shield but oblivious to their true meaning, Dante reads the words, but their deeper sense eludes him; as Dante himself notes, "il senso lor m'&amp; duro" (Inf. III, 12). As ominous as it is austere, this "scritta morta" is nothing less than the divine artist's "signature," God's certification that hell is his creation, the collaborative achieve- ment of his triune nature: "fecemi la podestate" (God the Father), "la somma sapienza" (the son), and "'1 primo amore" (the Holy Ghost). However, it is one thing to apprehend the literal meaning of the ominous words, quite another to absorb their true essence. Dante, like the majority of his readers, will need some time to come to terms with the jarring notion that the same love that moves the sun and the other stars was moved to create hell. Indeed, the criticism addressed to Dante by the Eagle in the heaven of Jupiter is equally fitting here: "Fai come quei che la cosa per nome / apprende ben, ma la sua quiditate / veder non pu6 se altri non la prome" (Par. XX, 91-93). Though the intellect can grasp the letter ("la cosa per nome"), experience alone-the terrifying spectacle of divine justice in ac- tion-will reveal the "quiddity," the profound implications of these stark words. Once we have entered this portal, reminders that God, "il rei del universo," reigns over this dark realm he created are relatively scarce. Brunetto Latini observes that any shade who rests for but a moment must remain one hundred years below the rain of flames without brushing himself off (Inf. XV, 38-39), and he takes leave of Dante fairly abruptly upon noting the approach of another crowd of sodomites with whom he "should not mix" (Inf. XIV, 118). Later, as Virgil and Dante flee from antagonistic devils of the fifth bolgia, we learn, to our relief, that the "alta provedenza" (Inf. XXIII, 55) that made the devils ministers of the fifth bolgia simultaneously deprived them of the power to leave it. However, such direct reminders of God's governorship of hell's penal system are few and far between. 26</page><page sequence="27">M L N Indeed, one of the most striking qualities of Dante's penal system is the degree to which it appears to be self-governing; hell's perfect internal equilibrium-based on the dynamic economy of pain eter- nally dealt and received-would seem to render any external regula- tion unnecessary. The key to this infernal self-sufficiency is the application of the law of contrapasso, a principle of justice whose very essence lies in reflexivity: the insight that the sinners' torment is ultimately self-inflicted, an eternal ingathering of the pain sown by each in the course of his or her lifetime. Even when punishment is administered by devils, these devils are cast not as agents, but instruments of justice whose task is that of facilitating the shades' "self-martyrization"; Mohammed, cloven from chin to anus by a sword-wielding devil, spreads open his chest, exclaiming: "Or vedi com'io mi dilacco!" (Inf. XXVIII, 30). Under the circumstances, it is all too easy to forget that every motion in this terrifying machinery of violence, from Francesca's buffeting to Ugolino's ceaseless gnawing of Ruggiero's nape, is willed by God. However, to lose sight of God's fundamental role in meting out punishment is to "apprehend" the letter while disregarding the "quiditate." How, indeed, should readers go about reconciling them- selves to this notion of a God unabashedly bent on vendetta and an explicitly hostile Christ-the "nimica podesta" (Inf. VI, 96) charged with bringing sinners to justice?41 Perhaps Boccaccio's gloss on the Filippo Argenti passage of Inferno VIII provides a key to understand- ing the function of divine wrath in Dante's Inferno. Discomfited by this weird incongruity between Filippo's seemingly 41 Sensitive to the difficulty of reconciling this theme of righteous anger with Christian charity and yet unwilling to simply divorce the figure of Christ from his dynamic role as judge and avenger, Dante resolves this dilemma by casting Christ as an absent protagonist in the drama of hell. It has often been observed that in Inferno, Dante never identifies Christ by name, but instead uses periphrases. Just as a periphrasis "speaks around" the person to whom it refers, forcing the reader to construct the absent identity on the basis of circumstantial clues, the scarred landscape of hell and other scattered evidence of Christ's absence serve, paradoxically, to secure Christ's enduring "presence" even in the deepest recesses of hell. Not only does hell's deep void bear the scars of his passage, but the lesioned landscape functions as an eternal memento christi for the sinners. The laments of Francesca and her lust-buffeted company are not, it is implied, an unvarying cacophony of "dolenti note" (Inf. V, 25), but are unleashed with particular vehemence upon facing a "ruina" (Inf. V, 34) that interrupts the wall hemming in their eternal rounds. No doubt the other ruine that mar the symmetries of the infernal architecture have the same punitive effect of abrading a spiritual lesion by repeatedly confronting the sinners with a concrete reminder that Christ was absent from their hearts while they where alive. 27</page><page sequence="28">TOBIAS FOSTER GITTES innocuous identification of himself as "one who weeps" and Dante's vicious response, Boccaccio felt it necessary to provide his audience with a brief excursus on the distinction between praiseworthy and condemnable forms of anger.42 According to Boccaccio, Dante's anger falls into the category of "mansuetudine," a term derived from Aristotle's Ethics denoting those whose anger is regulated by reason. It is this sort of anger, continues Boccaccio, to which the Psalmist was referring when he wrote "Irascimini, et nolite peccare" (Psalm 4, 5), and it is this sort of anger that moved Christ to scourge the merchants who had set up shop in the temple: E da questa ira dobbiam credere essere stato commosso Cristo, nel quale mai non fu peccato alcuno, quando, preso un mazo di funi, cacci6 del tempio i venditori e' comperatori, dicendo: &lt;Domus mea domus orationis&gt; etc. This sort of anger is, notes Boccaccio, termed "sdegno" by many and though frequently misused ("spessissimamente in mala parte si pone" [Esp. VIII, lit., 54]), when applied correctly it describes the dispassion- ate, just ire exercised by Christ. That Virgil's use of the adjective "sdegnosa" in his commendation of Dante is intended not simply to suggest a general quality but to convey this precise meaning is supported by the use of the closely related word "disdegno" (Inf. IX, 88) to describe the attitude of the angelic "messo" dispatched from 42 Today, we take it for granted that the phrase used by Virgil to congratulate Dante ("Alma sdegnosa, / benedetta colei che 'n te s'incinse!" Inf. VIII, 44-45) is modeled on the memorable words uttered by a woman in praise of Christ in Luke 11.27 "Blessed is the womb that bore you .. ." Who would deny the striking similarity between these two passages? And yet, in an age with a far keener ear for such biblical allusions than our own and one, moreover, in which the adjective "benedetta" was more often than not used to describe the Virgin Mary, this particular resonance appears to have gone unnoticed. Indeed, a quick survey of the commentary tradition suggests that it was the nineteenth-century commentator Tommaseo (1837) who first made this association explicit. After Tommaseo, this association is rarely omitted. Perhaps-and this is pure speculation-the absence of any mention of Luke in the early commentaries should not be considered a peculiar collective oversight, so much as a concerted reticence. After all, if one accepts the scriptural origin of the phrase, "Alma sdegnosa, / benedetta colei che 'n te s'incinse" one must also recognize that Dante is likening himself to Christ, an identification that, under the circumstances, would appear to be flattering neither to Christ, who should not be implicated in a violent exchange that has all the earmarks of a private vendetta, nor to Dante, whose apparent pretensions to a Christ-like stature make the presumptuous Filippo look modest by comparison. Coming, as it does, so soon after his moving displays of compassion towards the sinners in the first three circles, Dante's haughty and violent repulsion of the mud-besmirched Filippo Argenti is as unsettling as it is unexpected. 28</page><page sequence="29">MLN 29 heaven to open the gates of Dis in the next canto, and again to characterize the wrath of God himself incited by Original Sin, the "gran disdegno" (Par. XXVI, 113) alluded to by Adam. If Adam's trespass elicits God's "gran disdegno," what adjective could possibly hope to describe the variety of disdegno elicited by Lucifer's mutiny? The most excellent of God's creations, Lucifer conspired to usurp his throne, thereby perpetrating an act of violence directed not only against God in his person, but against God's kingdom, his "possessions": the "superbo strupo." It stands to reason that Lucifer's contrapasso appears to reflect the dual nature of his transgression. He is devoured (Inf. XXXI, 142) just as he had aimed to "devour" the Kingdom of God, and his Kingdom is pillaged and "raped" just as he had pillaged and raped God's virginal kingdom. In sum, the rapist is raped, and thus, to paraphrase Bertran de Born, one sees in hell the law of contrapasso. Concordia University</page></plain_text>
