<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. CHARLES M. BAKEWELL. IN the history of philosophy there is no figure that awak- ens as many interesting and helpful, and, I may add, varied and baffling suggestions, as does the quaint and in- scrutable Athenian sage who used as freely to confess his own ignorance as he did his physical ugliness, and as relentlessly to expose the sham wisdom of others as he did the sham beauty of face and form that concealed the ugly soul; who more than any other man possessed that sub- lime indifference to non-essentials which comes from a recognition of their relative worthlessness. Not that there was anything of the Laodicean in his make-up; for Soc- rates was in earnest, madly in earnest, in his search after truth. And there is no philosopher more familiar to all men. Everyone knows about Socrates, from the gossip of his domestic infelicities with the trying, and no doubt much tried, Xanthippe, to the story of his sublime fare- well to his friends ere he drank the fatal cup. And who</page><page sequence="2">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 11 has not heard that Socrates used to say, that the superior wisdom which his fellow citizens sometimes attributed to him consisted in the simple fact that he knew that in truth he knew nothing. But it not infrequently happens that what we are most familiar with, we least understand; and many and various are the estimates that students have made of this familiar philosopher and his distinctive achievement. And when one turns to the earliest records, made by his disciples and friends, one finds the same per- plexing discrepancies. Here are many men representing his views, a Plato, a Xenophon, a Diogenes, an Antis- thenes; and all giving different accounts; and Socrates himself has written never a word by which we might test their reports. The first impression one is likely to gather is, that the real Socrates was probably an interesting and unusually magnetic personality, with an exceptional genius for stimulating others to construct philosophies, but pos- sessed of no definite philosophy of his own. Yet it is precisely in the variety of these interpretations that we are to look for one of the secrets of his strength. For my part I doubt not that had some recording Boswell tagged about continually at the heels of Socrates, noting down his every word aInd preserving it for posterity, we should say, upon comparing that record with the Platonic portrait: "A good photograph; a poor likeness. His mere words reveal as little the secret of his power, as does that Silenus face that nature gave him disclose the strength and purity of the soul that lived behind it." None the less, would that we had such a record, that we might make the comparison! But what I wish to emphasize is, that the difficulty in interpreting Socrates springs from the wealth and not from the poverty of his genius. Think of it! A man in the private walks, of life, a poor, and by birth obscure citizen of Athens, was able to shake his city- state to its very foundations. And how? Simply by his philosophical conversations. And was able so to influ- ence some of the greatest men of his time, and among them the world's greatest poet-philosopher, that ever after</page><page sequence="3">12 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. they are unable clearly to distinguish their own thinking from his, to tell exactly where his views break off and their own constructive thinking begins; and are willing, nay eager, to make him the mouthpiece of their own best in- tellectual endeavor. Such a man is greater than any ac- count given of him. And I sometimes grow impatient over works that appear on Socrates,-and scarcely a year rolls round that does not bring its burden of Socratic monographs,-written by some petty pedant or other who prides himself on being an 'objective' historian, the ob- jectivity of whose work is chiefly shown in the free use of negatives and in the careful elimination from the por- trait of every trace of genuine vision. Such a work re- cently fell into my hands. It dragged its weary length through more than a half a thousand pages, and in the end made of Socrates merely a genial and decidedly insipid social reformer with a utilitarian program. No, Soc- rates was one of those men, of whom the world has con- tained a few, who positively refuse to be classified. You can find no pigeon-hole into which he will fit. No label will stick. And if in what follows you think that I am trying after all to label him, and are inclined to take my label off and try another, I ask you: Consider him awhile from this angle before viewing him from another, and then be sure that the real Socrates was greater than either you or I have made him. The crisis which Socrates faced was at once religious and philosophical. He catches an inspiration,-no more, no less,-of a way of escape. That inspiration gives rise to a program, which ages will be required to carry out, and to a new I ideal of the wise, virtuous, and religious man. But, and this is the most striking point, he is him- self a marvellously complete embodiment of this new ideal. Thus he comes to occupy a position altogether unique 11In saying ' new ' I do not mean made out of whole cloth. Nothing in that sense new is ever effective. But we date, and rightly, an idea or ideal from the man who, besides making it articulate, gains for it a hearing and makes it tell.</page><page sequence="4">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 13 in the history of philosophy; one can find a parallel only by turning to the founders of new religions. He is not a teacher merely, but an example, and as such is glorified, idealized, and in later times almost deified. Even the prosy Aristotle comes under the spell, though at a great distance. If he wants to illustrate a point in his writing, it is the figure of Socrates that at once presents itself to his mind. And down to the present day we catch an echo of this baser use in our logic books where, all but univer- sally, Socrates's mortality is made a peg to hang Barbara on. With Plato, however, Socrates is simply philosophy itself alive and at work, dispelling the clouds of ignorance, stimulating one to clearer and more consistent thinking, and making for general human righteousness. Over the "Euthyphro" you might write, as a sub-title, The way a philosopher comes into inevitable conflict with the unthink- ing but cock-sure traditional pietist; over the "Apology," The way a philosopher defends himself and his calling; over the " Crito, " The way a philosopher shows his rever- ence for the State; over the "Phaodo," The way a phi- losopher should face death; over the "Republic," The way a philosopher expounds the nature and the inherent desirability of the righteous life. With Xenophon, Soc- rates is the pattern good citizen. In later times he sits to the Stoics for the portrait of the sage, is in fact, barring Zeno, the one case of the complete realization of their ideal. When in doubt what to do, ask yourself what would Soc- rates have done? For "though you are not yet a Socrates," to quote Epictetus, "you ought to live as one seeking to be a Socrates. " The death-blow was long since dealt to the German fiction die Sophistik, which used to be regarded as a sort of malignant power that went to and fro in the Greek world, seeking what innocent youths it might find to cor- rupt, teaching them how to make a show of wisdom which gave them the advantage over their less skilled brethren, so that they could make the worse appear the better rea- son, bring all men into their power, and make their own</page><page sequence="5">14 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. capricious wills prevail. Yet it is still the custom to make the Sophists in some peculiar sense responsible for the chaotic condition in which we find philosophy, morals, and religion in the time of Socrates. This is only to fall into the common human error of mistaking a symptom of a disease for its cause. The simple truth is that the old education had proved insufficient to meet the needs of the Athenian youth and the old teachers incompetent to satisfy the new felt want. And all of a sudden Athens blossoms into a sort of informal university. The Sophists were its self-appointed professors, and they delivered their lec- tures in the market place, in the gymnasia, or, better still, in thehouse of some wealthy Callias, a patron of the newer learning. It was to be sure a university with a free elec- tive system, and with no rigid requirements; so the edu- cation it dispensed was not characterized by special thoroughness or aimfulness; and its professors bid for pupils, crying up their own wares and sometimes crying down those of their rivals. They had their several spe- cialties; one taught rhetoric, another virtue, one astron- omy, another the nice discrimination of words; most of them were ingenious interpreters of the poets and adepts in the art of deluging an audience with words. And yet the reporters for the yellow journals, or the mischief making gossips who supplied their place in Athens, might have wrested from almost any of their speeches sayings that would make the teeth of the hard-shell conservative chatter. "Nothing exists; if anything did exist, we could never know it; if perchance a man should come to know it, it would remain a secret, he would be unable to describe it to his fellow men." Or again, "Man is the measure of all things." Or again: "With regard to the gods I know not whether they exist or not, or what they are like. Many things prevent our knowing; the subject is obscure, and brief is the span of our mortal life." Or again, another Sophist might be found, in Machiavellian fashion, explain- ing the serviceableness of religion as an adjunct to the po- lice force of the state, and telling how some clever pre-</page><page sequence="6">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 15 historic genius invented the gods; and another might be heard translating the religious traditions of the Greeks into ethical allegories. The skepticism indeed is there, and nothing is sacred from its disintegrating touch. But the Sophists found it; they did not create it. It had been preparing in the bosom of Greek philosophy from the time when one of the earliest philosophers identified the material stuff of which the universe was supposed to be made, with the divine. Xenophanes had contributed his share when he came forward, in opposition to the anthropomorphic re- ligion of his people, ridiculing the view which made the gods come into being and pass away,, living a life of pas- sion and wearing the body of man, and roundly condemn- ing Homer and Hesiod for ascribing to the gods all things that were a disgrace among men. Euripides was not help ing matters by introducing the gods upon the stage. The moral disputes of Olympus were argued in the presence of the Athenian populace and became common property. The gods were all the while losing the prestige of dis- tance. The extent of the moral chaos of the time may be seen from the impassioned speeches which Plato puts in the mouth of his brothers in the second book of the "Re- public. " Justice was regarded as the lesser of two evils, or as due to the force of social compulsion; the good was another name for the expedient; virtue was to be pur- sued for the respectability that it gave, or for the sake of the rewards in store for the just man on one side of the grave or the other. In short, men were kept in the path of virtue by the police, the parson, and Mrs. Grundy. But the desirable consequences that were supposed to come from leading a virtuous life were viewed as some- thing altogether extraneous to virtue itself. These are the things the young men hear 'dinning in their ears,' and they appeal to Socrates as the one man who can help them to a higher view. Nothing could show more clearly than this passage does, the place which, in Plato's mind, Socrates occupied in the moral crisis of his day. And the Vol. X.-No. 1. 2</page><page sequence="7">16 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. work of the philosophers too, culminating as it did in con- tradictory views of reality, and checked by no rigorous method, must share the blame for the prevailing distrust of reason. If this scepticism is more pronounced in the Sophists, if it was they who gave it most definite and tell- ing formulation, that is only because they were the fore- most representatives of the enlightenment of their age. There is a story that Plato tells, that, whether it be an artistic invention of the pupil or whether it report an ac- tual occurrence,-and this I hold to be a question as un- important as it is unanswerable,-gives the key to what I have called Socrates's inspiration. In the "Phaedo " Socrates is telling of his early interest in philosophical speculation and of his inability to find any satisfaction therein. One day he heard a friend reading from a book by Anaxagoras which declared that mind was the author of all things. "Here at last," he exclaims, (I paraphrase his story) "I thought that I had found a philosopher after my own heart. But judge my disappointment when I found that, although asserting mind to be the cause of all things, he then went on to speak of air and ether and what not, as if anything rather than mind were the cause. For if mind be the cause, then we can show that each thing is as it is because it is best for it so to be. It is as if one should assert that mind is the cause of my actions, and then should go on to explain that I am sitting here in prison because my body is made of bones and muscles divided and disposed in certain ways. So far as they are concerned, I might have been in Megara long ago. If mind is the cause of my actions, I am here because I chose the better part of remaining, instead of running away and playing truant when friend Crito made the opportunity for me to do so, and of enduring the punishment which the state saw fit to infliet." This teleological idea, the notion that all has its place in the unity and harmony of the good, Socrates never deserts. But in the work of Anaxagoras he finds it no sooner asserted than aban- doned. So far the criticism bears a certain resemblance</page><page sequence="8">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 17 to the criticism often heard in our day of 'intellectual- ismi' that "the absolute is useless for deductive pur- poses. . . You cannot enter the phenomenal world with the notion of it in your grasp, and name beforehand any detail which you are likely to meet there." 2 And Soc. rates confesses his inability to apply the notion in this fashion. Even if mind be the author of all things, one cannot of course take one's place forthwith at the point of view of divine wisdom, and discover how things are by seeing how it is best for them to be. But he has a sec- ond string to his bow. There is another voyage, failing this more ambitious venture, that man may hopefully un- dertake. He may turn from the macrocosm to the micro- cosm, to the world within, the world of human thought and action, and, guided by the Anaxagorean inspiration, seek to discover mind as author of all things there. Yet here again one can find no short and easy path to divine vision. For one finds in this inner world for the most part chaos and confusion, ignorance and anarchy. The inspiration but defines a program, appoints a task, an endless task; calls the mind to stand forth and perform its creative function in its own world, and thus to fulfill its own divine nature. JIn short, Socrates acquires a sublime confidence in reason as the author of all, and is conse- quently indomitably optimistic. And while he distrusts the power of human reason to apply this principle to the physical world, or even to the inner world as actually ex- isting,-a distrust which spares him the necessity of con- sidering the problem of evil which Plato, not sharing it, had to face,-he is no less confident that human reason is able to reach certain and universal truth, precisely in so far as it succeeds in putting reason in control in fashion- ing the inner world into unity and aimfulness. Thus Socrates's answer to the septic who would say: All is relative; man is the measure; therefore there are only individual opinions, and 'truth' is merely a compli- 2 James, "A Pluralistic Universe," p. 126.</page><page sequence="9">18 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. mentary characterization of one's own beliefs, is in ef- fect: I grant man is the measure, there is no escape, but let us see whether we do not come more and more into agree- ment, in proportion as we think our own individual thoughts. If and in so far as we do, we keep acquiring confidence in our individual reason as having a common or universal nature. The existing confusion is brought about, not because men are thinking for themselves, but because they do not think enough; because there are cer- tain rules of the game which they continually violate. The trouble is not that men are sceptical, but that they are not radical enough in their skepticism. They stop short when it suits their capricious convenience. The first rule of the game of thinking is to get your ideas clear and definite; the second is, never shuffle your meanings; and the third is, always follow through. Thus, coming at a time when the moral and religious home of his people is already laid waste, Socrates does not sit idly in the midst of the resulting desolation, gazing wistfully into the past and dreaming of a restoration of the good old days of simple faith which fancy conjures up, after the fashion of the indolent conservative; nor does he desert the old place, after the manner of the Sophists, in search of new dwellings apart from religion; nor yet does he seek in vain, like Aristophanes, to rouse the people to rebuild the old home from the remaining fragments. Nay, the house must first be made more deso- late still by tearing down the few columns and walls left standing, in order to make room for the foundations of the new temple of God which his awakened religious con- sciousness dimly descried in the future, which was to rest on a thorough knowledge of self. And from this point of view we can easily see how Socrates should come to be regarded as the most destructive and dangerous of the Sophists. There was a large class of words,-words too on every one's tongue,-which derived their meaning largely from the old and discredited religious sanctions. They were words applying to all the relations of life:</page><page sequence="10">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 19 courage, piety, temperance, justice, holiness, and the like. These too must be submitted to the searching test of reason. It is always the first result of skepticism to make men misologists. The old religious sanctions under which we have long been living secure, are passing away. Reason herself has dealt the fatal blow. But in their place we can see nothing definite coming. When reason attempts to put something positive in their place, she seems baffled; confusion confronts her. Many claimants appear for the vacant land, with apparently equally good and equally bad title. Who shall settle the rival claims?' Is it not rather a task beyond our power? Why then spend time and strength in a vain cause? Better turn from theory to practice; put on the cloak of humility and go out into the garden and work. It is the well known position of the ethically inclined sophist of all ages. But, easy as this solution seems, it takes little reflection to show its worth- lessness. And this is Socrates's answer: You cannot turn to the practical life without first reckoning with the prob- lems of philosophy and religion which you scorn. For how can a man work to any profit if he have no definite aim; and how could he realize that aim without knowl- edge of the tools at his disposal The aim according to Socrates and the Sophists alike, is the well-being of man. But what, then, is man? Unless I can answer this ques- tion, how can I know what is best for him? The first rule for the truly practical man to observe is: Know thyself. The prevailing skepticism of the day is itself responsible for the change in the center of interest, which is some- times credited to Socrates, from the outer world to man and his interests. The cry is, Teach us the things that will avail us in life. And Socrates devotes his life to the heeding of this cry. Not, to be sure, in the way men who pride themselves most on being 'practical' intend. He does not lay down a series of rules and precepts for obtaining fame and wealth and power, or even for obtain- ing virtue. He goes to the root of the matter. We must</page><page sequence="11">20 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. first make ourselves clear as to the aim of life, before we can say anything about the means for realizing that aim. That the well-being of man is the aim of life needs for Socrates no proof. After all, it is an identical proposi- tion.3 But we have not got very far when we have said this. Who shall say wherein the well-being of man con- sists; who shall give this idea a form fit for use, and valid for all? The answer must of course be man; but what man? Any one you please; or the majority of men? No, clearly the ' one best man, ' that is, the one who best knows himself. If we could only find him! But how should we recognize him when found unless we also knew our- selves? Thus the prime necessity is universal self-knowl. edge; the recognition that man is the measure is followed by the conviction that we can and must know that meas- ure. And when we look about us, we find every one act- ing and speaking as if he knew it. In every one's mouth are the words justice, piety, temperance, and the rest of the words by which we judge conduct in ourselves, in others, and in the state, and seal it with our approval or disapproval. And when we judge of an act, we judge it by reference to an end more or less consciously present to our minds. Yet it is in these very matters concern- ing conduct that we find the greatest differences among men; and it is just here that differences lead to greatest enmities. This existing confusion shows that men are not clear in their own minds as to the meaning and implica- tion of the terms they are using, or as to the end they would reach. At any rate it is worth while to see whether a mental house-cleaning would not remove this discord. The slovenliness of most of what passes for thinking is cov- ered up by the use of words of many meanings, and by the further trick of, consciously or unconsciously, shift- " Even the Westminster catechism, after telling us that "the chief end of man is to glorify God," adds, "and to enjoy him forever," and thereby merely declares that the true well-being of man is to be sought in the en- joyment of God rather than in the enjoyment of worldly vanities.</page><page sequence="12">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 21 ing one's ground when in a difficulty. These things are the stock in trade of demagogues and other princes of the plausible; and they are also the source of that con- ceit of wisdom so striking in the young, and in popular idols, but also found wherever men are content to lead the 'unexamined life, ' the life that Socrates held to be un- worthy to be lived by a man. And the procedure which Socrates follows is defined by the contrast. He starts of course where he finds himself, with the principle he judges to be the strongest. Was there ever an absolutist who thought he could start anywhere else? Then he seeks to make his meaning precise and clear, and, having done this, to test its value by applying it to experience, to see whether he can retain the principle when it is given full range. As some one has said, speaking of Hegel, get your notions clear, then give them plenty of rope, and see whether or not they hang themselves. In most cases you will find that they will. This for Aristotle is the substance of Socrates's achievement: "inductive reason- ing and universal definition,"' two things, he adds, which are "the very foundations of knowledge."' Certainly, this is the task to which Socrates devoted his life, probing and testing the opinions of himself and his fellow-men, everywhere bringing about that conviction of ignorance which, like the conviction of sin in later times, is the necessary preparation for the higher life. Aris- totle declared the purpose of the tragedy to be the purg- ing of the emotions through pity and fear. It was not to amuse, nor to point a moral, but by an earnest and seri. ous action so to awaken the emotions of pity and fear, that afterwards the hearer would find himself in the pos- session of purer emotions, which could then be trusted to take care of themselves. Socrates's work has a similar aim: by presenting ignorance in its true light he would purge the intellect, and by banishing the conceit of knowl- edge which bars the way to truth, leave the intellect purer and freer. It could then be trusted of itself to bear the fruits of intellect; just as the emotions after the presenta-</page><page sequence="13">22 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. tion of the Oresteia could be trusted to ring truer than before. So he approaches every one whom he can reach, old and young, artisan and statesman, poet and sophist, questioning each about that which he is reputed to know; and everywhere he finds the same result, ignorance mas- querading as wisdom, and that most of all in matters that concern the highest welfare of man. And he sets him- self relentlessly to the task of tearing off disguises, break- ing idols, exposing shams, and seeking to put conscious ignorance in the place of conceit of knowledge. It was not a task to make its devotee popular. The 'enlight- ened,' now as well as in the days of Socrates, prefer to remain in the undisturbed possession of comfortably vague and sliding views on principles that concern con- duct and life; and the conservative always hates the man who 'strays from the broad and beaten ways.' But Soc. rates was little concerned about his popularity. He is firmly persuaded, as he assures us, that God has com- manded him to spend his life in the search after truth, and in examining himself and others. And this brings us to the other half of his teaching. Were we to stop here with what has been said, we might perhaps regard the Socratic elenchus as performing a function analogous to the Cartesian doubt or the Baconian iconoclasm,- a process whereby the slate is wiped clean and made ready for a fresh start,-and, following Aris- totle, we should credit him with having seen, and clearly exhibited in his own procedure, what are surely essential conditions of all sound thinking; and we should give him all glory for these achievements. But we should still miss the secret of his hold upon his followers. To them he appeared primarily as a great moral and religious teacher, inspiring men through his example as much as, if not more than, through his teaching. This is more obvious even in Plato than in Xenophon. It is a striking note in almost all of the dialogues except those that are concerned with the more technical issues of dialectic, and those which were written in Plato's later years in which</page><page sequence="14">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 23 Socrates has either disappeared altogether or no longer carries the title role. It is shown in the whole attitude of Socrates toward the younger men and their reverential devotion to him; in many a casual remark like the praise of the blunt old warrior Laches; in the unconscious tribute of the earnest youths in the "Republic"'; in the bald and unrestrained speech of Alcibiades when in his cups. And it is certain that Socrates viewed himself as hav- ing a divinely appointed mission to his fellow-men. " Fellow Athenians, " he exclaims in the Platonic version of his "Apology," " I love you; I am devoted to you; but I shall obey God rather than you. And while breath and strength hold out I shall never cease from pursuing wisdom, or from exhorting any one of you whom I may meet, speaking frankly to him, and saying in my usual fashion: My friend, as a citizen of Athens, a city greatest and most famous for its wisdom and power, are you not ashamed to be so greedy for wealth and name and fame, so careless and so thoughtless about wisdom and truth and the perfecting of your own soul I And if he contradicts me, and says that he does care about these things, I shall not take him at his word and straightway let him go, but I shall question him and cross-question him and test him, and if I find that he is not virtuous but only says that he is, I shall rebuke him for priz- ing least what is of most value and prizing most what is of less worth. This service I shall render to every one I meet. . . . Be assured, this is God's command. And I hold that no greater blessing has ever befallen you in Athens than this my service to God. For I spend all my time going about among you, persuading you, old and young alike, not to be so solici- tous about your bodies or your possessions, but first of all, and most ear- nestly, to consider how to make your souls as perfect as possible; and telling you that wealth does not bring virtue: rather, virtue brings wealth and every other human good, private or public." The defence is simple, downright, and to us, more than twenty centuries later, convincing. Yet it is easy to see why it did not convince his judges. He does not and could not meet the charge in the sense intended by his ac- cusers. He was a heretic and a revolutionary from their standpoint. And the almost defiant tone of the defence seems to indicate that Socrates was conscious of the fact that the position for which he stood was in irreconcilable antagonism with the traditional beliefs of his country- men. And yet Socrates speaks throughout as if he felt that in his trial he was standing for a principle, and that the highest religious principle; and that nothing short of</page><page sequence="15">24 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. absolute acquittal freely given by his judges could suffice. He must carry that principle through, unsullied by com- promise of any kind, to triumph in his acquittal, or, fails ing that, equally to triumph in his death, which alterna. tive he fearlessly faces. It had been the custom in Athens for one accused to bring in wife, children, and relatives, and make a scene in court in order to work upon the sym- pathy of the judges. In place of doing this, Socrates seizes the opportunity to read the Athenians a lesson on the disgracefulness of this practice, which he regards as undignified and impious, both on the part of the accused and on the part of his judges, and he adds: "Were I to persuade you, were I to overpower your oaths by my im- portunings, I should clearly be teaching you to believe that there are no gods. In my very defence I should liter- ally be accusing myself of unbelief." We have here a new note in religion. * Piety is shown not in ceremonial and creed, but in conduct. And God is no longer con- ceived as a power to be placated, or even, in more phi- losophic fashion, as the cause and substance of things, but rather as the embodiment of the ideal that lives in our human strivings. Thus unceasing self-examination, our distinctively hu- man privilege, is regarded as the fundamental religious duty. It is only by this pathway that one can come to a knowledge of God. After the purging process, when the world within has been reduced to a condition resembling the primitive cosmic chaos of Anaxagoras, the mind steps in and puts things in order. Socrates had noticed the fact that the peculiar mark of knowledge is a certain spontaneity. Question a man rightly, and he will dis- cover the truth for himself. But how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already within him, waiting, as it were, to be elicited? We can know our ignorance only in so far as, from the point of view of a larger vision, that ignorance is shown up in its own inadequacy. And this possibility which is ours, of continually setting aside, and once for all, the less com-</page><page sequence="16">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 25 plete in favor of the more complete view, not only gives us increasing confidence in the objective value of individ. ual reasoning, but also defines the nature of knowledge as an infinite progress toward the goal of perfect wisdom, which is and can be infinitely progressive only because that goal is also active in us as an ever present guide in our search after truth. Socrates views this under the image of reminiscence, which is referred to in the Phado as his favorite doctrine. It is as if the soul in reaching knowl- edge were harking back to its divine inheritance. And the moral chaos is removed in the same way. Morality consists in knowing how rightly to love and how rightly to hate. It was an old Greek view. And down beneath all human longing is the fundamental homing in- stinct, the desire to recover the divine vision. And the world of human affections is graded as is the world of human truth,-so many stepping stones toward the vision of beauty absolute, toward possession and birth in beauty absolute. There is something of the mystic in Socrates, and I am not sure that what is called Platonic love should not rather be called Socratic love. In the "Symposium" the other characters are drawn to life; why not Socrates also? The mysteries4of love which the wise Diotima re- vealed may well enough be Plato's interpretation of the eros motive in the life of Socrates. The speech of Alcibiades would rather bear this theory out. However this may be, Socrates's application of the re- flective principle and method to religion, led him to re- gard God as the highest wisdom, and through this concept at once to strike the death blow to polytheism and at the same time to gather the world of human activity, with all its contradictions, into one comprehensive whole; and, in the latter consequence, to save the independence and freedom of the individual from the chains of outer au- thority, while yet preserving the harmony of the whole. Thus he could stand for an individualism of the strongest dye without dissolving the world into a chaos of social atoms, each seeking its private gain. For the individual,</page><page sequence="17">26 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. taken in his full compass and depth, as he appears to the man who truly knows himself, has not lost sight of his fellows. He is thus able and in duty bound to stand above society and the state and religion, to judge and condemn these institutions where they fail of wisdom, but at the same time to reverence them as representing after all, however inadequately, that highest ideal which is his own aim. It is this that marks the religious from the irreli- gious reformer. The one sees too far to be proud, and reverences the institutions which he would remove be- cause seeing in them what they would be and are not, and destroys only that he may build. The other, puffed up by a little wisdom, sees merely what these institutions are not, and is content to destroy. The perennial problem of freedom has been well put in a saying ascribed to the Pythagoreans: "How find that freedom which, without unity, is an illusion; and that unity which, without freedom, is a snare ? II Socrates, with his view of God and man, and of the relation of one to the other, and of the divinely appointed human task, end- less, never fulfilled, but a task that man may be always fulfilling, has given us the key to the solution of the prob- lem, and at the same time projected that solution into the future as an ideal that will be forever drawing us on. Yet this view is indeed destructive of the old Greek view of authority, as of any view which makes the source of authority external. And we can readily see how he should have been regarded as the most dangerous of the Sophists. A doctrine which the conservative regards as dangerous, is always doubly dangerous when espoused by a man of unimpeachable character. When a wicked man up- holds a dangerous doctrine, his wickedness is its easy refutation. Besides, the Socratic individualism was not the latitudinarian individualism of the average Sophist, with its live and let live, every man for himself. That view at least left room for the conservative to hug his own chains. Socrates 's individualism was one that spoke with authority.</page><page sequence="18">THE UNIQUE CASE OF SOCRATES. 27 And it is in this same combination of individualism with authority that we find the explanation of the extraordi- nary hold which Socrates had upon his disciples, so that they regarded him as the hero of the moral and intellec- tual drama of mankind. It was a characteristic of the di- vine, as Socrates viewed it, to be in need of nothing; and that man was likest to the divine who was most the master of himself and his circumstances. "So frugal was he," writes Xenophon, "that I do not know whether any one could earn so little by the labor of his hands, as not to procure sufficient to have satisfied Socrates." And yet there was nothing of the ascetic about him. He could en- joy a banquet with the best of them, and, if drinking was in order, could carry enough to qualify as a Scotch gentleman, though no one ever saw him under the influ- ence. It is a characteristic picture which Plato gives us in the "Symposium," where, one by one, the guests fall under the table, and in the early hours of the morning Socrates is represented as earnestly trying to convince Agathon and Aristophanes, the only other survivors, that the genius of comedy is the same as the genius of tragedy. But the tragic and the comic poet are already nodding, and soon join the great majority, while Socrates goes off as dawn is breaking, takes his morning bath and goes about his business, quite in his accustomed way. And he can endure hardships too, cold, hunger, and the dangers of war, with the same imperturbability. His was a life always steadied and ordered by reason. In him his fol- lowers could see a living example of a moral law at once self-imposed and at the same time worthy to count as the voice of God. The gods of Greek tradition had passed on a few noble precepts, and many ignoble examples. And herein is evident the fact that the Greeks had outgrown their gods. Any one who would take Zeus as his model of conduct, would soon be guilty of the most heinous crimes. Socrates has not only introduced a higher con- ception of the divine nature, he has also been a worthy example of the ideal which that conception puts for hu-</page><page sequence="19">28 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. man conduct. And it is thus that he comes to occupy a position in philosophy analogous to that of the founders of religions. And similarly in the region of theoretic philosophy he stands for the doctrine that truth is always individual, and that at the same time there is a pattern truth, valid for all men. And so, somewhat idealized per- haps, he comes to be regarded as the living embodiment of that truth which is at once individual and universal. Socrates moves throughout his life as a man conscious of his weakness, and also of his strength; of the former, because he has not yet realized the wisdom and the good which is his right as a man; of the latter, because he has none the less succeeded in clearing away the stumbling blocks of ignorance enough to find in himself the evidence of the divine, dimly though he has compassed its depths. One feels in reading the story of his life, of his untiring, al- most fanatical pursuit of truth and virtue, that he is with a man filled with the missionary spirit, and made of the stuff of martyrs, because he feels himself to be in some mysterious way in touch with God, (Doesn't the familiar divine sign prove it!?) and knows that no evil can befall a good man either ip life or after death. He is in fact a philosophical prophet and priest, an Isaiah come to meet a religious crisis that had taken the form of a philosophical dispute. And the religion of Apollo has never found a nobler expression than in the simple life and peaceful death of the Athenian sage. CHARLES M. BAKEWELL. YALE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
