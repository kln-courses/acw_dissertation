VAZQUEZ In 1973 Fred Sandback wrote a short artist's statement titled "Notes" to accompany a spread of his work in the Milan-based magazine Flash Art (fig. 1 ). The text concisely outlines the aims of his sculpture and its larger plastic motivations: In no way is my work illusionistic. Illusionistic art refers you away from its factual existence toward something else. My work is full of illusions, but they don't refer to anything. Fact and illusion are equivalents. Trying to weed one out in favor of the other is dealing with an incomplete situation. Neither is my work environmental. It incorporates specific parts of the environment, but it's always coexistent with that environment, as opposed to overwhelming or destroying that environment in favor of a different one. Environmental art more or less disregards the situation in which it finds itself. Sculpture has a tendency to get bogged down in its own materiality. I'm not particularly fascinated by materials as such, and string seemed like a fairly neutral material to work with, something that wouldn't sidetrack more complex situations. The photographs of the work here provide one sort of knowledge about the work—a sort of schema of what it is. Beyond that, the pieces are totally contextual and the photographs are of no interest with regard to that. There isn't an idea which transcends the actuality of the pieces. The actuality is the idea.1 Sandback's rhetoric is combative and largely framed in the negative throughout. In both tone and aim these terse paragraphs are a manifesto. Even his concluding statement—"There isn't an idea which transcends the I would like to thank James Nisbet, Roger White, and Stephen Whiteman, as well as the anonymous RES reader for their thoughtful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this text.

"Notes" covered much ground: It spoke directly to Sandback's sculptures of the moment, yet he chose to illustrate only work up to 1970, prompting readers of the magazine unfamiliar with his art to look to his earlier, more bounded objects for tangible examples of his argument. In this way Sandback situated both bodies of work relative to an interpretive field of terms and practices—illusion, environment, materiality, photography, actuality—critically important to the artist and his peers. Over the course of his career Sandback would, at times, seek to dispel misunderstandings about his sculpture by directly refuting the critical reception; the predominantly negative tone of this statement is, however, uncharacteristic. The charged language used in "Notes" reflects the high stakes for Sandback in 1973. His early, geometrically tinged constructions in elastic cord and metal had been quite well received by the American and European art world in the late 1960s, but his practice was shifting toward more architecturally scaled work figured in acrylic yarn, itself a new sculptural material for the artist. These yarn works developed into a more contextual, locationally, informed mode of sculptural installation that Sandback used to activate the materiality of interior space, leaving his discrete objects, and some of their illusions, behind. So, the statement marks a crux in Sandback's practice as he transitioned into the media and concerns that would occupy him for the rest of his life, while establishing these parameters, curiously, through earlier works and documentary photographs. Sandback opens "Notes" with a dense excursus on illusion addressing not only the central issues of his earliest sculptures, but also minimalist materiality as seen through them. By reproducing his most object-like works, he draws the strongest contrast between his own sculpture and that of his minimalist precursors. Sandback employs the same vocabulary of illusion used by critics to describe his work—acknowledging its experiential power—and recasts it to more precisely define his past and future practice. His posited equivalence of fact and</page><page sequence="3">318 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Figure 2.

The remaining non-referential, abstract illusions created through material, pattern, and spatial juxtaposition not only defined debates related to formal concerns but also brought into focus more philosophical concerns about the relationship between perceptual knowledge and social experience.3 These conversations extend beyond Sandback's work, but his early sculptures from 1967 to 1969 create a material presence so shot through with illusion that it might be seen as the key feature of their form. Further, these illusions propel the work beyond its physical material presence and toward a contradictory actuality that both encompasses and cancels its form altogether. This cancelling figures a limit case in our understanding of objects, building surfaces at the edge of 2. R. Smithson, "Donald Judd," in Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings, ed.

Linear objects Sandback described the origin of Untitled (Red Floor Piece), his first mature work, made as a graduate student at the Yale School of Art, as arising from his fascination with contrary material juxtapositions and flowing from a casual studio exchange: In 1966 I found myself engaged in a sort of assemblage of odd pieces of industrial material, connected in series. The singsong interrelationship of the parts didn't have much energy or conviction. In response to my complaints about sculpture in general, and the incoherence of mine in particular, George Sugarman said something to the effect, "Well, if you are so sick of all the parts, why not just make a line with a ball of string and be done with it?" The first sculpture I made with a piece of string with a little wire, was the outline of a rectangular solid—a 2" x 4"—lying on the floor. It was a casual act, but it seemed to open up a lot of possibilities for me. I could assert a certain place or volume in its full materiality without occupying or obscuring it. I think my first attraction to this situation was to the way it allowed me to play with something both existing and not existing at the same time. The thing itself—the 2" x 4"—was just as material as it could be—a volume of air and light above the surface of the floor. Yet my forming of it, the</page><page sequence="4">Vazquez: Antimatter 319 Figure 3. Fred Sandback, Untitled (Red Floor Piece), 1967.

It voices Sandback's frustration with the additive, part-to-part sculpture indebted to David Smith and Anthony Caro, echoing complaints made by Donald Judd and Frank Stella in conversation with Bruce Glaser in 1964, and it highlights a desire to move past sculptural composition and into investigations of volumetric materiality on its own terms.5 To do this Sandback took elastic cord and stretched it around four small metal posts anchored in the floor, creating a rectangle measuring about two inches by four inches by twenty feet.6 The resulting work is all outline, a small amount of elastic and metal marking an airy form. As with any open perimeter, space courses freely around its bounding edges, indifferent to the sculpture's physical draw. Untitled (Red Floor Piece) set the terms of Sandback's immediate experiments, just as it shows its debt to the clean, linear forms of minimalism, which itself reached a high-water mark with the show Primary Structures at the Jewish Museum in New York in the spring of 1966. Though the main figures of minimal art—Judd, Robert Morris, Carl Andre, Anne.Truitt, Dan Flavin, et al.—cannot be reduced to a single minimalist formula, their sculptural production shared important similarities. From Dan Flavin's fluorescent light installations to Carl Andre's floor sculptures and Robert Morris's L-Beams, the artists associated with minimalism were all interested in repeated, modular forms; simple, often industrial, materials; and basic shapes that met the viewer on a bodily scale in relation to architectural spaces. From 1967 onward, Sandback's work would develop these strategies and formal vocabularies, extending and departing from them in equal measure.7 Distinct from the solidity and the repeated internal form of a work like Carl Andre's Lever, Sandback's initial sculptures have 4.

The length of Untitled (Red Floor Piece) varied over the years; at its longest the work measured twenty-two feet, and in its shortest iteration only twelve. As it is currently installed, according to the specifications of the Fred Sandback Estate, the work measures twenty two feet in length. Its dimensions, it should be noted, court a mimetic reading, even as the actual dimensions stray from the explicit 2 x 4 in. measurements. The exact height and width measurements are 15/e x 4'/2 in.

They mark the same relative space as Andre's brick work yet deny the sculpture's mass. As an object, Sandback's floor piece delimits but does not fill. Like Andre's work, its form is contingent and bound to a specific site, its mass and materiality staked together rather than placed end to end. While the work is formally complex in its play with a notion of self-contained, integral, and structurally sound sculpture, it can also be read as referential. Though Sandback would later explain his movement away from such early experiments as sidestepping their enclosure, Yve-Alain Bois asserts that their boundedness "was only a side effect. Their real flaw, rather, was their referring to something absent, the fact that they could so easily be read as distillations. That is: they still belonged to the epistemological realm of representation which was . . . what he, like his Minimalist mentors, wanted fundamentally to question."8 Noting the ubiquity of two by-four lengths of wood in American lumber yards, Bois argues that "Sandback's first elastic cord and metal piece does not function at all like a Minimalist work" due to its representational logic.9 Rather than only drawing attention to explicit materiality and perceived shape, Untitled (Red Floor Piece) also suggests an absent piece of wood. Bois's critique argues that the work describes a sort of as if scenario, its experiential ly unreal presence nearly that of a hologram, light projection, or, perhaps, an architectural rendering of a real, absent object. Sandback followed Untitled (Red Floor Piece) with experimental works conceived in direct engagement with their surrounding architecture, including a number of slim vertical works held between floor and ceiling, thereby refusing any immediate illusionistic reference (fig. 5). These permutations, however, straddle a line between representation and an architecturally aware orientation resonant with the body-based models of minimalism being theorized by Robert Morris at the time.10 The experiment of these bounded forms would 8. Y.-A. Bois, "A Drawing That Is Habitable," in Fred Sandback (see note 1), p. 28. Sandback would later explain, "the first construction was a depiction of the perimeter of an imaginary volume. It described the edges of a rectangular solid on the floor, two inches high by four inches wide by twenty feet long. A lot of the early pieces had the quality of being a boundary of an object, more or less. They still had a sense of containment that referred to the sculptural object."

Sandback would devote little more than three years to these rigid and semi-rigid elastic cord and metal works before moving more fully into location specific constructions in elastic cord and, by the time he wrote the Flash Art statement in 1973, acrylic yarn. These early sculptural objects, which recast minimal forms as if drawn, reveal Sandback's concerns in miniature, their size and boundaries standing in productive tension with both the sculptural object and its illusory envelope.11 11. Here I diverge slightly from Bois, who argues for the later Shadow Piece (1967) as the most generative model for Sandback's mature work.

Though Sandback's subsequent early works share formal similarities with Untitled (Red Floor Piece), they dispense with its allusion to real-world objects, instead outlining geometric shapes only partially.12 At his first solo exhibition, Fred Sandback: Plastische Konstruktionen at the Konrad Fischer Galerie in Düsseldorf from May 18 to June 11,1968, Sandback lined the walls of Fischer's tiny gallery with two works per side, and included a small corner piece running up the wall (fig. 6). Where Untitled (Red Floor Piece) reaches beyond itself in its reference to wooden planks, the works on view at Fischer dwell more fully in the here and now of the gallery. These sculptures harness both material and illusion to maneuver through present form; the lines set the boundedness of implied shape and its immediate surround in tension with their combined sculptural presence. To put it differently: Following Untitled (Red Floor Piece), Sandback deploys illusion as a productively ambiguous operation, simultaneously creating shapes legible as complete forms just as such illusory completion checks any materially defined wholeness. The six-part untitled series of long-edged, right-angle forms figured in thin metal is exemplary in this regard. The work leans against the wall of Fischer's gallery, the edges of each unit perched atop small nails creating the impression of oblong boxes. Each piece is open on architecture: to implicate it, however, without making of it the referent of the work, the origin and cause of its formal configuration." Bois (see note 8), p. 30. 12. These early works generally took one of three forms: exclusively metal, often painted constructions, those built of metal and elastic, and works drawn in only elastic cord (a material similar to a fine bungee cord). Though examples exist made of metal wire—woven stainless steel in one instance and copper in another—these are exceptions to the general choice of material during these years.</page><page sequence="7">322 RES 65/66 2014/2015 A Figure 6.

Sandback suggests completed form by mirroring the juncture of wall and floor beneath, and incorporating the surface of the supporting wall through its specific installation. The plane of the wall solidifies the outer metal edges, just as the shadows cast on the plaster from the steel rods reinforce the overall shape. More directly than Untitled (Red Floor Piece), yet still not exclusively context-dependent, this perceptual wholeness exists in direct relationship to the variable sites of its presentation. This is the power of Sandback's use of illusion: By drawing on the specific properties of the material object in concert with those of the architecture, the works exceed them both. Returning to the language of the 1973 statement, these works project a diaphanous completeness built through literal form and perceived extension. The sculptures create a counterpoint to their surrounding—and constituting—environment, one which uses the material envelope of the building to produce a sculpturally and spatially coexistent presence. Among the earliest written criticism on Sandback, "The Perception of Illusion: Object and Environment," by the artist and critic Peter Hutchinson, discusses Untitled, a 1968 four-part corner piece similar to the three part corner work shown at Fischer's gallery (fig. 7).13 This work—similar toTatlin's corner counter-reliefs or contemporaneous work by Dan Flavin—draws attention to the meeting of two walls, placing four small, open, rectangular sculptural units built from elastic and steel rod, evenly stacked across a corner. Hutchinson's piece 13. P. Hutchinson, "The Perception of Illusion: Object and Environment," Arts Magazine 42, no. 6 (April 1968): 13, 15.</page><page sequence="8">Vazquez: Antimatter 323 narrates an ongoing tension between the minimalist specific object and environmental work—including, according to his definition, happenings, theater, and kinetic sculpture—using both to parse the current terms of sculptural autonomy.14 Sandback, he argues, occupies a middle position in this field due to his object's illusory properties. Of particular interest in Sandback's work "is the illusion that there is another work coexisting within the piece we are looking at, an illusory work that is defined or suggested by the actual physical piece."15 Rather than a referential object, as with Untitled (Red Floor Piece), Hutchinson describes a distinct illusionistic volume bounded and cued by the elastic cord and metal armature in relationship to the wall that completes the form. This nexus of sculpture and architecture sheaths another object inside it, which is essentially a measure of observed space. On this account, "the physical aspects of the work, then, are such that the work is almost entirely illusory. We are left looking at a clearly defined volume that almost appears solid but is really air."16 Due to their interior illusions, these forms are neither completely autonomous nor wholly environmental. Instead, "the work includes the idea of the place" nestled within it, marking a separate but intertwined immateriality.17 Rather than an illusionistic, conjuring presence, Hutchinson describes the appearance of a paradoxically airy solid implied by the arrangement of Sandback's lines. This illusion compels closer inspection of the object itself and its surrounding environment. Important to both critic and artist, Sandback's intervention does not overpower its specific location, but develops an illusory syntax to probe it. By 1973, the artist's own "Notes" would describe these immaterial sculptural effects in stark terms: "My work is full of illusions, but they don't refer to anything. Fact and illusion are equivalents. Trying to weed one out in favor of the other is dealing with an incomplete situation."18 This later phrasing is more forceful than Hutchinson's observation because the work's illusions reflect the larger perceptual manifold, 14. Robert Morris would also map a field of sculpture between object and environment around this time in "Notes on Sculpture, Part 4: Beyond Objects" [1969], reprinted in R. Morris, Continuous Project Altered Daily: The Writings of Robert Morris (Cambridge, MA, 1993), pp. 57-61, though the likely reference is to Donald Judd's use of the same distinction in "Specific Objects" [1965], reprinted in D. Judd, Complete Writings 1959-1975 (Halifax, 1975), pp. 181-189. 15. Hutchinson (see note 13), p. 13. 16. Ibid. 17. Ibid., p. 15. 18. Sandback (see note 1 ). Figure 7.

This complete situation, staged in real space, is essential to these increasingly open, spare works. Among Sandback's earliest impulses was "to make sculpture that</page><page sequence="9">324 RES 65/66 2014/2015 didn't have an inside,"19 and understanding the illusory presences of his sculpture as inseparable from his manipulated material allows these objects to draw the comfortable interiority posited by the minimalist cube more fully outward into lived space. His airy linearity aspired to a formal transparency and a simple, material everydayness at the same time. In his description of Sandback's 1968 sculpture, however, Hutchinson rightly separates the illusion from the material itself, nesting it within Sandback's lines, and in the process describes an inside. The small scale of these early objects makes this unwanted interiority sometimes unavoidable. Such compressed spaces become palpably tactile when framed so tightly, and this close configuration of line does not allow the object to expand into a more ambiguous relationship between its material form and its permeable presence within the surrounding environment. The language of Hutchinson's critique, however, clarifies Sandback's early strategies and is echoed in another early review by Hans Strelow, a Düsseldorf gallerist and co-organizer with Konrad Fischer of the Prospect art fairs. Strelow describes Sandback's work as "the edges of simple forms,"20 and Hutchinson mentions that the sculptures often "have edges missing."21 These formulations suggest that Sandback's work is neither linear nor planar, but simply made of edges that hinge discrete objects and the larger environment. While both writers discuss lines and planes, the notion of an object made purely of edge is a provocative one. Edges are difficult to locate in the work, as they define the absolute limits of surface where the juncture of opposing planes creates a line. Yet there are, strictly speaking, no physical planes in Sandback's work, and the lines that trace his forms are not the product of joints, but are themselves distinct. Though we can bump into Sandback's edges as we would those of a piece of wood or metal, they are, paradoxically, edges of nothing. Sandback's edges operate more like holes in reverse, framing an intangibly physical surface enmeshed in their presence, and in this way offer a powerful device for thinking through 19. Sandback (see note 4), p. 119. 20. H. Strelow, "Das Ei des Kolumbus für die Minimal Art," Rheinische Post (Düsseldorf), June 12, 1968. Strelow's original German reads: "Die Kanten von einfachen Plastischen Körpern deutet Sandback mit Farbigem Draht und jeweils gleichfarbenen Gummibändern an, die so gespannt sind, daß sie ebenso stark im Durchmesser sind wie der verwendete Draht." 21. Hutchinson (see note 13), p. 13. Sandback's sculpture.22 In an undated statement, wherein Sandback moves through many of the same terms and ideas as those in his Flash Art text, the artist described his own edge-like materiality, writing: "I seem to have to balance on the edge of things. Pictorial space is illusory and somewhere else. I want my work to be in the world the same as a board is, but it can't get so strong or elaborate that it starts controlling everything around it."23 Though Sandback offers the term as metaphor, his work edges in a more literal way, its sculptural integrity drawn equally from presence and inference. "Boxes are fairly complicated things .. Just as they paradoxically bound Sandback's own insubstantial objects, edges are a key term within broader debates on minimalist objecthood, particularly in Judd's work. After meeting Sandback while a visiting artist at Yale in 1967, Judd became a friend and mentor early in Sandback's career. In January 1968, Judd held a three-day presentation of Sandback's work in his New York studio, introducing the younger artist to gallerists Konrad Fischer and Virginia Dwan. During time spent with Judd, one can assume that Sandback looked closely at the elder artist's objects and material choices. For his part, Judd prized the complex interplay between specific materials and their often-diverging visual reception, writing approvingly of the illusions in Frank Stella's Copper Paintings, for example, as early as 1962.24 In his own practice, Judd frequently used polished metals and colored Plexiglas to create a vaporous effect born of shine and reflection (fig. 8). Though initially confusing, such juxtapositions mean to precisely describe the boundaries of distinct surfaces. As Richard Shiff has noted, "such intriguing, but disconcerting, instances of visual illusion are so conspicuously at the center of our experience of Judd's work that we are induced to judge 22.

The text, dated between 1973-1975, references Sandback's other major text from the period, also entitled "Notes," published in an exhibition catalog for a show at the Kunstraum in Munich, Germany, in 1975, which uses many of the same formulations and key terms.

Or at least regard them, as he did, as the real alternative to the illusionism of the western tradition."25 In presenting illusion as a form of perceptual experience, itself real if intangible, Judd's work seeks a heightened calibration between intuited form and actual perception in the viewing moment. Rosalind Krauss took issue with this facet of Judd's work in an early text. In describing the work's contradictory presence, she argues, "Judd's own criticism would seem to accept that art which eschews both allusion and illusion. Yet his sculpture derives its power from a heightening of illusion—although not of pictorial illusion but of lived illusion."26 Following David Raskin's gloss, Krauss posits "that Judd's art has a discrepancy— or even a falsification—at its heart," in its recourse to illusion.27 Krauss described her experience of a hanging progression piece of Judd's from 1965 as one of opposing frontal and recessional views, the latter recalling architectural colonnades, which are an association quite external to the object. Such a work "becomes then, an irritant for, and a heightening of, the awareness in the viewer that he approaches objects to make meaning of them, that when he grasps real structures, he does so as meaningful, whole presences."28 Krauss dwells not only on form, but also meaning made manifest through it; the shifting valences of illusion operate as a cipher for the inexhaustible experience of human attempts at understanding the world. While Krauss and Judd disagree on the potential clarity afforded by Judd's illusions, Krauss, among others, finds their perceptual stakes to be the essential element of visual interest in Judd's work. In a more recent text, "The Material Uncanny," Krauss analyzes Judd's materiality through a discussion of illusion, edge, and hollowness. In addition to the illusions created by distinct materials and surfaces in sharp juxtaposition, these components also allay the threat of composition: [Judd] wanted to make work that had as few elements as possible, (thus if a surface were inherently colored as, say, copper is, two elements—painted color + surface—would be reduced to only one). Such parsimony would allow all the elements to relate self-evidently to a pre-given whole. That way there would be no hierarchy among the elements, 25. Shiff (ibid.), p. 44.

An example of this from a 1967 conversation in which Judd identifies edge as one of the elements he considered most seriously: "Boxes are fairly complicated things," he said to Barbara Rose and Frank Stella, "you've got eight edges." Here the edges are the elements, and the box is the whole that binds each element equally into its unity . .. ,29 29. R. Krauss, "The Material Uncanny," in Donald Judd: Early Fabricated Work, exh. cat (New York: PaceWildenstein, 1998), p. 8 (emphasis original). On the whole, hollowness in Judd becomes a metaphor Krauss reads as the absence/presence of the trauma of industrialization and capitalism at the core of twentieth-century visual art from Brancusi through the present via Freud's discussion of the uncanny. The text is grounded in Robert Smithson's early essay on Judd from 1965.</page><page sequence="11">326 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Judd's compositional interest in edges mirrors his appreciation of Stella's striped and shaped canvases, yet, for Judd, "the shape-as-protocol was not to be the framing edge of the canvas but the shape-construction of the three-dimensional polygon. The 'box' with eight elements is like the rectangular frame in Stella's Die Fahne Hoch!, only slightly more complex, because freestanding."30 To accomplish this compositional edging, Judd's objects prioritize volume over mass, foregrounding each edge and joint in a cohesive wholeness. Judd's eight edges apply to the four vertical joins and the four horizontal junctures that define a box's top plane. Judd discounts the edges formed by box and ground plane, favoring instead the internal reference created by eight lines that both form and define the object.31 Such edges often generate illusory effects in judd's objects, as in many of the artist's open boxes of the late 1960s, where, for example, a four-sided aluminum exterior shell, open at the front and back, is faced with a thin layer of colored Plexiglas on the inside surfaces. In such works the exterior edges remain crisply legible, whereas the interior joints, depending on lighting and angle, are obscured by reflection and sheen. Judd combined edge and form in an often baffling transparency of construction that asserts a material presence through an essential interiority that binds objects into wholenesses. Though his materials are also transparent, edge and surface combine quite differently in Sandback's early sculpture. Sandback looked at Judd's work closely enough to internalize its operative paradox between direct specificity and contradictory materiality. Where Judd's edges cohere into exterior skin and bounded interior space, Sandback used illusion to avoid a wholly contained interiority. His edges frame a planar openness that does not encase an autonomous form, but creates one suspended between literal material and 30. Krauss (ibid.), p. 8. 31. Judd goes on to say "You see seven of them [edges] all at once in different—from a different angle. Just a simple box is really a pretty complicated thing." Judd, quoted in unpublished interview with Barbara Rose. The complete transcript is held in the Barbara Rose Papers (930100) Series II, Box 1, Folder 23 at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (p. 40). In staking such a claim, Judd's minimalism is different from that of Robert Morris, who would admit the surrounding environment into the sculptural situation. Judd seems to hold out for as pure a visual experience as possible, a single edge obscured by vision, but not necessarily by the body in space. Worth noting, too, is that Judd's discussion with Rose and Frank Stella took place on December 18, 1967—at the conclusion of Judd's semester as a visiting artist at Yale, where he first came to know Sandback. illusory existence within surrounding space. Rather than opposing inferiority and exteriority to further define the object, the ambiguity of line, edge, and plane collapse the experience of an object's inside into its outside—into the environment itself. For this reason Sandback's early sculptures are not hollow. Their edges constantly reverse the necessary interiority that hollowness, and the Juddian object, requires.32 Hollowness posits a stable materiality that frames emptiness within. A work of Sandback's, like the untitled curved sculpture shown at Fischer's (fig. 6), immediately suggests hollowness in its outline, but its scant material does not hold a stable enough form to be so described. Sandback's sculpture draws attention to hollowness as a property of objects and also our habits of conferring object-status onto things we see by figuring a limit case to that projection. By teasing out a physical position beyond the reach of complete objecthood, Sandback's constructions transpose the question of interiority into one of surround, bypassing an object centered wholeness in favor of a contextual materiality always inside and outside. Perceiving illusion, seeing surface While debates on hollowness, interiority, and objecthood played out in the relatively circumscribed field of abstract sculpture, larger concerns with the properties and implications of illusion (and often illusionism as well) were regularly voiced throughout the 1960s across a range of media and disciplinary fields, from discussions of newspaper caricatures and Op Art to debates in art history, the psychology of perception, and philosophy. Ernst Gombrich's Art and Illusion, first published in 1960 (and frequently republished in subsequent years), deserves credit for its synthesis of art history and psychology in staging some of this historical conversation. Contrary to its title, however, Gombrich's argument for an historically defined and context dependent theory of the visual arts—that depictions are based in particular schema and preexisting, intelligible forms of visuality—is not a treatise on the sort of lived illusion that animates Krauss's discussion. Gombrich's 32. Michael Fried made much of hollowness in mounting his critique of literalism in "Art and Objecthood": "the apparent hollowness of most literalist work—the quality of having an inside—is almost blatantly anthropomorphic. It is, as numerous commentators have remarked approvingly, as though the work in question has an inner, even secret, life ...M.

His chosen subject matter did lead Gombrich to a more general theory of vision; in Art and Illusion he wrote: "To 'see' means to guess at something 'out there/ what [Adelbert] Ames called the 'thereness-thatness' of experience. ... All thinking is sorting, classifying. All perceiving relates to expectations, and therefore to comparisons."33 Such a theory of expectant perception placed Gombrich's views in line with the influential psychologists R. L. Gregory and Julian Hochberg, among others, who theorized a context-aware observer for whom perception is a mixture of pure sensation, memory, and inference.34 In his text "The Confounded Eye," included in Illusion in Art and Nature, co-edited with Gombrich in 1973, Gregory states his position clearly: "There seems to be no sudden break between perceiving an object and guessing an object. If all perceiving of objects requires some guessing, we may think of sensory stimulation as providing data for hypotheses concerning the state of the external world. The selected hypotheses, following this view, are perceptions."35 Our perceptual apparatus, then, employs a certain amount of inference, and ordinary perception operates much like scientific method, checking facts against hypotheses, which can then be judged correct or further adjusted. Gregory describes illusions as a type of perceptual error, the product of "bad" perceptual hypotheses, which can stem from either physiological or cognitive mechanisms. After moving through a range of distinct types of illusions (those generated by ambiguity, paradox, misunderstanding data and fact, and so on), Gregory posits a notion of the factual distinctly different from Sandback's own. "Facts 33. E. H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation (Princeton, 1972), p. 301. 34. Gombrich, Gregory, and Hochberg each published essays in a range of interdisciplinary collections in the early 1970s, including Art, Perception, and Reality (1972), which included essays by Gombrich and Hochberg along with a text by the philosopher Max Black, all originally delivered as theThalheimer Lectures at Johns Hopkins University in 1970; and Illusion in Art and Nature (1973), edited by Gregory and Gombrich, which compiled a range of scientific, psychological, and art historical essays on the occasion of a contemporaneous exhibition curated by Roland Penrose at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. 35.

Facts, or physical events, cannot be uncertain, ambiguous, distorted, or paradoxical: and they cannot go beyond themselves to be fiction. We may speak loosely of a line being distorted or bent but we mean by this that it differs from some line, real or ideal. It is not facts, it is description, which can be ambiguous, distorted, or paradoxical."36 This rigid notion of factuality not only posits a truth beyond perception, but also refuses the experiential permeability of Sandback's complete situation or even the doubling held within Josef Albers's notion of actual and factual facts, famously described in his Interaction of Color.37 In general, Gombrich, Gregory, and Hochberg's respective discussions of art—mainly pictorial—raise questions distinct from those particular to minimalism. Yet their hypothetical discussions of objects experienced in the world, factual or otherwise, uncannily echo the simple forms and conceptual stakes of minimal sculpture. In describing his theory of expectancies, that is, the way that distinct glances across the visual field are informed by expectations drawn from peripheral vision, Hochberg dwells on the physical properties of an object's edge with a degree of precision that Judd himself would have appreciated.38 Simple forms in lived space recur with some regularity throughout the writings of these authors, yet they are principally exemplary rather than theoretical. An altogether different approach to such objects— and to theories of perception generally—can be found in the writings of the Cornell University psychologist James J. Gibson. Gibson, whose The Perception of the Visual World (1950) is cited repeatedly in Art and Illusion, theorized an ecological approach to perception throughout the 1960s and 1970s whereby all perceptual data is gleaned directly from the physical environment.39 The first major statement of this theory was published in The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (1966)— and these and related texts are cited in critical writings by Dan Graham and Mel Bochner among others—and further developed in The Ecological Approach to Visual 36. Ibid., p. 90. 37. Albers writes of actual, experiential facts: "This kind of fact seems parallel to the common saying 'what actually happened,' that is, what happened in time, what went on, what moved, what developed." See J. Albers, Interaction of Color [1963], rev. ed. (New Haven, 1975), p. 73.

His theory describes a perceiver able to understand the world based on the flow of invariant, unchanging objects and properties—like texture patterns—that occur across our experience of the visual field in the larger environment.41 Setting aside the question of the validity of Gibson's arguments in the larger debate on perception, his view—from the early "ground theory" onward—can be characterized as a theory of edges and surfaces. Gibson explained room-scaled orientation as a series of overlapping surfaces (like tables, floors, and walls) with distinct texture grades. "The edge of a surface in the room is specified by a discontinuity in the flow of optical texture, as at the tabletop. The corner of a surface in the room, the angle of two planes, is specified by another kind of discontinuity in the [optical] flow. . . . Texture can be 'wiped out' by another or 'cut across' by another. This kind of optical discontinuity corresponds to a separation of surfaces in the world."42 This small-scale description of overlapping leads to a larger theory of surface- and edge-adefining perceptual vistas. Leaving tables behind, "when the man in the room walks up to and through the door, the edge of the doorframe expands to uncover the new array of the next room. The same unwiping of the new array (or wiping out of the old one) occurs in reaching the corner of a street or the brow of a hill."43 Gibson would formulate the implications of this statement most directly in his last book, writing: "To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it. The interchange between hidden and unhidden surfaces is essential to this awareness."44 40. See Mel Bochner's "The Serial Attitude" (1967), reprinted in M.

Gibson does, however, maintain that illusions are the result of what he calls deficient perception, and should be classified along with "misrepresentations in general" (p. 310). 44. J. J. Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (Boston, 1979), p. 255. My attention was drawn to this passage by Mace (see note 41). Unlike Gregory's facts, which either are or are not, Gibson's theory of surface, while quite technical and grounded in much experimental research, is also surprisingly poetic. Describing his systems-based understanding of perception, Gibson allowed for the role of memories, judgments, thoughts, and dreams in an inclusive notion of nonperceptual awareness that complements more straightforward perceptual information: "To daydream, dream, or imagine wishfully (or fearfully) is to be aware of surfaces or events that do not exist or occur and that are outside the limits of possibility."45 This language of desire and longing, tied to the seemingly simple understanding of surfaces—both present and absent—inflects the stakes of Sandback's line dramatically. His reading of Judd, in seeking a more complete and complex situation for the viewer and the object, figures a nimble understanding of surface and edge that develops outward from our tendency to assume certain forms exist, and to question the stability that projection affords. Antimatter Sandback was not alone in refiguring Judd's surfaces. In an early exhibition review, commissioned by Judd himself, Robert Smithson describes Judd's specific objects as paradoxical forms where "all surfaces vanish."46 An uncanny materiality inherent in the surface engulfs the basic structure. Both surface and structure exist simultaneously in a suspended condition. What is outside vanishes to meet the inside, while what is inside vanishes to meet the outside. The concept of 'antimatter' overruns, and fills everything, making these very definite works verge on the notion of disappearance. The important phenomenon is always the basic lack of substance at the core of the "facts." The more one tries to grasp the surface structure, the more baffling it becomes. The work seems to have no natural equivalent to anything physical, yet all it brings to mind is physicality.47 This careful reading cuts to the central issue in Judd's work for early Smithson, and also for Sandback, that of an untenable interiority overtaken by illusion: "the important phenomenon is always the basic lack of substance at the core of the 'facts.'"

Ibid., p. 6.</page><page sequence="14">Vazquez: Antimatter 329 viewer their expected reflection across a mirrored surface, the seemingly unreal, baffling experience of such expectant looking echoes material presence through its opposite. Here Sandback's words are directly to the point. Facts need not be material, and an unexpected immateriality is as factual as anything else. Smithson's reading rhetorically dissolves judd's objects to such a degree that their descriptive remainder uncannily echoes Sandback's work. The sculptures exhibited at Konrad Fischer, with their metal rectangular forms standing on edge, cut a presence analogous to sculptural antimatter. For Smithson and Sandback, Judd's works prompted not only an interest in the properties of materials, but also a way of thinking through space. What Smithson describes with the metaphor of a union through vanishing, Sandback himself would discuss in terms of a dramatic shift in his conceptualization of sculptural space. Describing these early works, he explained: "I was still thinking in terms of sculptural space. It would have been easier, probably, if I had thought more in terms of a different kind of space. But it was unavoidable to perceive that the sculptures didn't stop where the lines did, and that the situation had gotten more complex."48 In this later assessment, Sandback recombines key terms from his 1973 statement, where he noted his yarn's materiality as a "fairly neutral" presence "that wouldn't sidetrack more complex situations."49 The work's illusory—and elusive— materiality triggers this situational complexity. Instead of defining a complete and coherent figure, the sculpture implicates and takes from surrounding space, scattering its materiality in the process. Actuality Among the illustrations Sandback published in Flash Art were a pair of drawings illustrating a series of "situations" presented at the Dwan Gallery in January 1969 (fig. 1, lower right). Sandback gave this, his first New York solo show, a title reflecting his developing process, calling it "Five Situations; Eight Separate Pieces."50 The exhibition involved a series 48. Sandback quoted in Prokopoff, reprinted in Fred Sandback (see note 1 ), p. 109. 49. Sandback (see note 1 ). 50. Though the show was also known simply as "Five Situations" and "Situations and Smaller Pieces" in Dwan Gallery filings and press releases. See, for example, the internal filing sheet for this exhibition, "Fred Sandback: Five Situations," tagged as FSNY69.1, or the John of five interrelated sculptural installations, described as situations, each four days long. This series was followed by a slightly longer presentation of eight works similar to those shown at Konrad Fischer the previous year (fig. 9). During each distinct situation, Sandback placed various rectangular elastic cord constructions in different places throughout the gallery. At the end of the interval the works were rearranged. These constructions, variously executed in blue, red, yellow, and gray cord, all appeared to lean against the gallery walls, and were sized according to the spaces dictated by wall lengths, doorways, and other architectural features. These five scenarios cohered around their use of like forms, even as their organization changed regularly. The show's poster, complete with a schedule, foregrounded rearrangement in its incremental description of the objects, so though the specific changes eluded one-time viewers, the idea of spatial rearrangement would have been present, or at the very least suggested (fig. 10). The iterative, incremental, sculptural process expanded across the duration of the show as the variations developed across a widening temporal gap. While similar to Sandback's contemporaneous sculpture in their boundedness of shape and use of materials, these new situational objects differed dramatically in their inclusion of sequenced and re-arranged presentations. Like Robert Morris's installation Continuous Project Altered Daily shown a few months later at Leo Castelli's warehouse, they engage the memory of the prospective viewer. Most powerfully, these works stretched Sandback's edges beyond the illusory sites of the "leaned" parallelograms themselves, and cast their sculptural presence—as illusion—more fully into their surround. Whereas the row of six rectangular forms of 1968 suggests extension beyond itself through repetition, by 1969 Sandback had begun to stage repetition as absence in these situations. The illusions multiply exponentially through the association of sculpture potentially resting in a certain site, expanding with the ghosts of sculpture into architecture. Sandback encourages viewers, through the physical and temporal suggestion of shifting surfaces, to look everywhere sculpturally, to regard space itself as the material bound by present and absent edges. In this temporal unfolding, illusion and material stretch beyond themselves, compelling an experiential awareness beyond the Weber press release entitled "Fred Sandback Sculpture Exhibition Situations and Smaller Pieces."

This full collapse of material and illusion is the first articulation of what Sandback would repeatedly refer to as sculptural actuality. As noted at the outset, Sandback ends his 1973 statement with a final negation: "There isn't an idea which transcends the actuality of the pieces. The actuality is the idea." Such actuality binds illusion and objecthood together such that each destabilizes the other to create a complex situational materiality of form forged through environmental presence. Sandback repeatedly used the term "actuality" to describe his work at this time. Generally suggestive of reality—what actually happens, to return to Josef Albers's phrasing—the term "actuality" was given a more specific meaning by George Kubler, an undergraduate professor of Sandback's at Yale. Kubier wrote, "Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes: it is the instant between the ticks of the watch: it is a void interval slipping forever through time: the rupture between past and future: the gap at the poles of the revolving magnetic field, infinitesimally small but ultimately real. It is the interchronic pause when nothing is happening. It is the void between events."51 For Kubier, actuality defines the differential spacing built into reality that allows for the construction of meaning, even as the actual always escapes our perception, available to us only as various echoes, signals, and reconstructions.52 51.

Kubler was widely read in the late 1960s art world and, in part through his usage, "actuality" gained currency as a descriptive model for aesthetic experience, most notably in texts by Robert Smithson and Robert Morris, both of whom used the term in essays published in 1966. While Smithson's actuality collapses past and future into a timeless sameness, and Morris's usage explains the unknowable form of a gestalt, Sandback's refers to the unstable balance between sculptural materiality and experienced presence found in his early work.53 Sandback's actuality, in relation to his early sculpture, is a robust understanding of lived illusion. It connotes absences not framed by light but bounded by edge, tinged with materiality. At the most basic level, these works require an awareness of surfaces and of the potential they hold to frame our understanding of objects, discrete environments, and the world. This surface perception is a mode of normal, everyday experience and a more particular, sculptural seeing. The complete situation Sandback hoped for balances on the edge between these two. Though Sandback would soon stop figuring enclosed forms so overtly, it was through these wire and elastic armatures that he first evoked the coproduction among architecture, material, and illusion hinted at in his earliest experiments. These linear forms capture a subtle materiality external to themselves but paradoxically made tangible through them, and in that gossamer actuality they stake a situational objecthood of possibility. 53. See Morris (see note 10), p. 234, and R. Smithson, "Quasi Infinities and the Waning of Space," in The Collected Writings (see note 2), pp. 34-35. Smithson thought about Judd's work in explicitly Kublerian language. In describing the fatiguing temporal experience of Judd's objects he wrote, "the probable transposition of the 'line' of time's arrow into a sequence of box-like terms minus the 'exact interval of time,' becomes an actuality. The 'times' when nothing is happening between two definite objects or terms." R.
