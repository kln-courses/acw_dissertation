Firkowitsch kept in Leningrad, is not available to the world of scholarship. ء Kitdb isldb alahldk, ed. by s. s. Wise, New York 1901. ت In the ninth chapter, the author states that he treats of love at the end of his work, and this theme is treated at length in some aspects, where our manuscript breaks off. But in view of the prolix style of our author, it is not improbable that a somewhat greater number of folios might be missing. The explanation, at the end, of the five occurrences of ברכי נפשי את יי (Ps. 103.1, 2, 22; 104.1, 35) and of the views of the Sages concerning this (cf., as most closely corresponding, Yalkul■ ham-Mekiri, ed. by s. Buber, Berdyczew 1899, ad Ps. 103, p. 129, 1.12-18. Further Yalkdt Sim'oni ad Ps. 103, § 857. For similar sayings cf. the occurrences quoted by s. Buber in his edition of Midras Tehillim, Wilna 1891, ٥٥ Ps. 103 note 13) does not seem to have been very short, in spite of all the assertions of the author that he had no space for the necessary detailed explanation, and, therefore, could deal only with the most fundamental points. 4 The quires of ten folios (1kurrdsah) are marked: at the top of fob 17a the beginning of the third kurrdsah (ُ&lt;الثهأ and ני) is indicated and at the top of fob 27a the beginning of the fourth kurrdsah (را ره and די). The ends of the second, third and fourth kurrdsah are marked at the bottoms of fol. 16b, 26b, and 36b by a red ا' ,גי ,בי respectively. Consequently, the first kurrdsah, now numbering from fob 1 to fob 6, is incomplete. As far as I could judge from the bound state of the manuscript, the first kurrdsah consists partly of loose folios. But on the other hand, the middle folios of the quire (fob 5-6 of 433</page><page sequence="2">434 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [2] passage, in which the plan of the work had been embodied.5 Further, the reading of the text which is anything but faultless, presents considerable difficulties. The pages which contain our treatise, are covered throughout with corrections which for the most part are necessary; sometimes, however, they seem to be merely unauthorized alterations of style. Numerous additions are found at the margins which likewise are usually very neces sary, but which are at times of doubtful origin.6 Moreover, an added disadvantage for the treatment of the work results from the fact that nothing is known to me about the personality of the author besides what M. Steinschneider had already pointed out a considerable time ago.7 Steinschneider is no doubt right in assuming that the author of our treatise is identical with the author of the work contained the original quire, now fol. 3-4), and as I believe, also fol. 2 and 5 (originally 4 and 7) have not been separated from each other. Thus, two folios of the text are missing (fol. 9 and 10 of the original quire), the counterparts of which had been blank and had appeared before the folio on which the beginning of the text is written. The work of Ibn Gabirol which begins on fol. 59b and has no lacuna, has its own numbering of the quires (ה' ,ד' ,נ' ,בי at the top of fol. 67a, 77a, 87a, and 97a respectively). Thus, it appears that two folios of the first quire are missing and that even this work was preceded by two blank folios, of which the remains of one are still visible. A second hand has added a through numbering of the quires of the whole manuscript in black letters at the bottom of the first and the final pages of each quire. But it is not independent of the old numbering. It begins on fol. 7a with a ב and ends on fol. 96b with a ', fol. 97a being marked by a ייא. For the possibility of a lacuna after fol. 46b see below p. 476, note 131. 5 See below p. 442 f. 6 One may guess that they are taken from an assumed larger work which is abbreviated in our treatise. Or perhaps they are taken from a better manu script. It is improbable that our Ms. was the author's own. Since no marginal notes are found in the work of Ibn Gabirol, we may note the vivid interest which our treatise stimulated in its readers. The fact that the text of Ibn Gabirol's work is correct, would explain only why there are no marginal notes in that work, but not why there are so many in our treatise. י Catalogus Librorum Hebraeorum in Bibl.

Poc. 223 and Hunt. 489 ( = Catalogue Neubauer Nos. 1313 and 1314 respectively), who quotes a work of his own with the title Makâlat derek ha-hasîdût. The derek ha-J1asîdût reappears as an indication of the subject, perhaps as a title,8 at the begin ning of our treatise. The identity in argument and style there confirms Steinschneider's assumption. That parts of the passage alluded to are not contained in our manuscript, is most easily explained by the assumption that our treatise might be an abridg ment.9 In particular what is said in this quotation about the stations of the Resurrection of the Dead and of Elijah, cannot be traced in our treatise. One would expect to find it here after chapter XX.10 8 See below p. 441, note 27. 9 In my opinion both here and in the fact that, in our manuscript, the program of the author is not completely carried out and that the treatment, at times, is not as adequate as might be expected, lies the only proof that we are indeed dealing with an abridgment of a larger work. The word muhtasar "abridgment," which the author constantly uses when he wishes to give the reason for not developing his ideas in full, might mean that the author has not actually exhausted his knowledge of the subject, but that he gives here only "a short treatise." The argument hitherto drawn from the title is of no decisive value (cf. below p. 441, note 27), and it is surpris ing that the author, when declaring in the third chapter that he has given a fitting title to our treatise, does not mention that it is only an abridgment from another work bearing another title. 10 The eighth chapter in Ms. or Hunt. 489, fol. I30a, ends with the state ment that the goal of this world is the perfect person who knows God and attains happiness. The ninth chapter defines real happiness as attainable by three things, namely renunciation (؛zuhd) and worship ('ibddah), both of which belong to the category of worship out of fear, and thirdly, knowledge and love of God which is worship out of love. And as an illustration of the different degrees of asceticism (=10ve out of fear), the quotation of a saying very near to the version contained in the Mishnah Sol. and in 'Ab. Zarah 20b which is the essence of our treatise (see below p. 442 f.), is given. The author says that it is taken from Hullin, but our text of Hullin contains no such passage. The text of this quotation and of what is given of its explanation, runs as follows (fol. I36a-137a) [cf. below note 15]: وفى ءذْ المراتى حمِءها .(Dt. 23.10) ר'רל ءى اول גמר חולין: ת־ר: ונשמרת מכל דבר רע (Ms.: 'ءالوا زء שלא יהרהר אדם ביום ויבוא לידי טומאה בלילה. מיכן א' ר' פינחס בן יאיר: זהירות מביאה לידי זריזות, זריזות מביאה לידי נקיות, נקיות מביאה לידי פרישות, פרישות מביאה לירי טהרה, טהרה מביאה לידי קדושה, קדושה מביאה לידי יראת חטא, יראת חטא מביאה לידי חסידות, חסידות מביאה לידי רוח הקדש, רוח הקדש מביאה לידי תחיית המתים, תהית המתים מביאה</page><page sequence="4">436 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [4] Since these two manuscripts are the work of our author, the work contained in Ms. or.

As to the terminus ante quem, only the date of the manuscript could be adduced. For this, the only reliable supposition is that when, during his stay in Aleppo between 1671 and 1681, Huntington bought these manuscripts which were presumably in the same state of incom pleteness as they now are, they were no longer new, but on the other hand they need not have been very old. The Ms. or. Hunt. 447 had been in other hands before. The oriental script which we meet with in our manuscript Hunt. 382, can be found in still later times.15 Consequently, we can say that our author lived between 1400 and 1600, and we might rather be inclined to prefer the lower limit, without actually being able to prove such an assumption.1י' As to our author's place of residence, we are in a state of still greater uncertainty. From the reference to certain practices con cerning the prediction of future events, practices which he him self had observed once in the extreme West of the Islamic world, one should draw no other conclusion than that at the time of writing he was no longer in the Magrib or in Spain. But neither Steinschneider nor Neubauer who, on account of this passage supposed the author to be living in the West, recognized that the passage is embodied in a quotation of Maimonides' Sêfer ham-miswôt, the beginning and the end of the quotation being distinctly marked by our author (Ms. or. Poc. 223, fol. 65a-b). The passage belongs to Maimonides and can be found under the 31st Prohibition in the Sêfer ham-mifwôt.IS In these circum 13 Very similar, for example, is the script of a document from 'Imâdîyah, dated Dec. 1764, and reproduced by J. Mann, Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature /, Cincinnati 1931, Pl. XXV. (A page of our manuscript is reproduced in the edition of Ibn Gabirol's ethical work, cf. above, p. 433, note 2). But in much earlier times, a similar writing can be traced. 13 There is not the slightest hint that our author had lived in Spain. 13 In the edition of the Arabic text by M. Bloch, Paris 1888, p. 185s. One sentence which is missing in the Arabic manuscripts (used by Bloch as well as in those of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, placed at my disposal through the kindness of Professor A. Marx), although found in Hebrew, is certainly cited by our author from the Arabic original. It runs, as one would expect from the Hebrew (I wish to call attention to the fact that all quota</page><page sequence="6">438 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [6] stances, we can say nothing definite about our author's place of residence, and nothing indicates that he had not lived in the East where his work apparently met with some success and where the sources he used were easily accessible. The treatise with which we are dealing is by no means unim portant. It provides us with a rare example of the deep pénétra tion of Sûfic thoughjt into the Jewish mind, or better still, into the minds of certain of the intellectual Jewish elite. The same treatise seems to be likewise unique in its adaptation of Sûfic terminology to Jewish modes of thought. It is mainly from the documents found in the Geniza in Cairo that we know that Islamic mystic literature was copied in Arabic in square char acters for Jewish readers.16 Here, we find verses of Hallâjian poetry and fragments of other mystical writings incorporated in a work pretending to expound true Jewish doctrines. In view of the intimate knowledge of Islamic literature found in educated Jews we should also expect to find in other Arabic works written by and for Jews some traits of undoubted Sûfic tions from Judaeo-Arabic manuscripts given in this paper are transcribed into Arabic characters, but no grammatical or orthographical "peculiarities" are either corrected or noted unless, in some cases, by an exclamation mark): رم ض ط الرمل و شم فيه ا&lt;ثكال(ا) وهدا كثير متهور قى المترب. 1، Fragments of al-Hallflj in square characters, together with some sen fences of afGazzMPs munkid min ad-dalM as marginal notes, are published by H.

But in general, we can say that such passages are comparatively rare.18 The great exception is Bahya's Guidance for the Duties of the Heart which is based entirely on Sûfic con ceptions and reveals to the Jewish reader the inner religious duties of a pious Muslim in their connection with what is prescribed in the Bible and in the later canonic Jewish literature. These religious duties, from the tawhîd, the confession of or the reflection on the Oneness of God, the starting point of ortho dox Sûfism, to the love of God, naturally do not fall under the category of ethics, even if we are inclined to stress the ethical element in them. In the time of Bahya, as he expressly states,1' they belonged exclusively to theology. Bahya himself tells us (what we ourselves might otherwise assume) that the whole field of Jewish theological literature which he had encountered, consisted of commentaries on and explanations of the Bible and expositions of the religious Law and argumentations and apol ogies for it.20 A Rabbi, to whom he explained his ideas concerning the inner duties, found them in conflict with tradition which forbids speculation about such matters.21 Therefore, both the long explanation of the purpose of Bahya's work and the state ment that he had composed the book originally for his own edification and not for publication,22 demonstrate what great 17 It seems fitting to remember here that Arabic "Neo-Platonic" philosophy and Çûfism, though the latter has many concepts in common with the former, can and must be carefully kept separate from each other. This has not been done on the rather scarce occasions where the word "$ûfic" has been applied to Jewish authors. 18 The remarks about §ûfic influence (and especially about that of the ideas of al-Muhâsibî) on Jewish writings, which are made by M. Smith (An early Mystic of Baghdad, London 1935, pp. 284-287), do not point out direct dependence on specifically Sûfic literature in the sense intended here. 19 Al-Hidâja 'ilâ farâ'id al-qulûb des Bachja Ibn Jôsêf Ibn Paqûda, ed. by A. S. Yahuda, Leyden 1912, p. XI, 5. Hence, J. Uri is much more correct when he styles our treatise a Liber de virtutibus Theologicis (ad No. 358 of his Catalogue, Oxford 1787), than A. Neubauer who calls it an ethical book (ad No. 1422 of his Catalogue, Oxford 1886). 20 Al-Hidâja, p. V f. 21 Al-Hidâja, p. 0 ץ top. 22 Al-Hidâja, p. X ץ .</page><page sequence="8">440 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [8] difficulties Bahya was prepared to encounter by adding new elements to a long and firmly established theology, making no attempt to conceal the origin of those new thoughts, an origin which could scarcely be successfully concealed from highly edu cated Jews in that time. But congenial to Jewish thought as works of enlightened men like Bahya were, they were favored also by the fact that the Islamic intellectual life was on the whole unfamiliar to the large mass of the Jews, and that after a while their contact with it was completely broken. Thus, when these works were rendered into Hebrew, there was no longer any danger of their betraying any traces of a foreign theology. They were raised above suspicion on the part of the orthodox, and nothing prevented them from appealing to Jewish minds of all classes. But as to the influence of Bahya's work in its original language, it is significant that the treatise with which we are dealing, does not show any real affinity or even superficial acquaintance with the Hidâyah. One characteristic feature of Sûfism remained completely outside the Judaism of the Arabic world, namely the outward appearance of organized Sûfic life, as the artificially produced ecstasy23 and the exaggerated glorification and practice of sys tematic seclusion, poverty, and renunciation. One of the out standing passages of Judaeo-Arabic literature is most likely intended as a distinct protest against this conception of religi osity which was dominant among the Muslims. For we are inclined to think rather of muslimic conceptions than of Chris tian ones when we hear that Judah Halevi, in his Cusari, begins his definition of the religious man according to Judaism, with the negative statement that "in Jewish opinion, the religious man is not to be defined as one who cuts himself off ([munkati') from the world."24 He would never have put this statement just יי Similar features among the Jews outside the Islamic world are not to be dealt with here. Owing to his dependency on Islamic writings, our author incidentally mentions some of the conceptions belonging to this chapter, like listening to music, gazing upon beautiful objects, intoxication through love (cf. below pp. 468 f.; 478). 4נ Book III.l (ed. by H. Hirschfeld, Leipzig 1882, p. 140/1). Only in ancient times, when there were really pious and holy men, was isolation (tafarrud) allowed and resorted to (cf. Book III.l and 21-22). Yet, there is</page><page sequence="9">[9] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 441 at the beginning, unless to combat the predominant conception in the mind of his supposed adversary. Our author might, of course, have been shocked by his own work, if he had been conscious of all the implications which his conceptions involved. But by this time, most of these conceptions had been so long and so commonly used that they had lost a good part of their original meaning. Therefore, we would scarcely be justified in attempting to interpret any particular conception as indicating definitely the group among the different orders of Sûfism to whose influence our author had been exposed.25 On the other hand, the source of much of what he says can be traced. We recognize, for example, that he made use of the famous Kitâb al-luma' fî t-tasawwuf by as-Sarraj (d.988),of al-Gazzâlî's(d. 1111) Ihyâ', and of as-Suhrawardî's (d. 1191) Ilikmat al-isrâk.26 Even the title of the work is clearly Sûfic. "The Way to Piety" which constitutes the catch word for the subject treated,27 needs no comment as to its Sûfic origin, even though the author is easily able to connect it with the Bible, giving as an instance the quotation of Ps. 25.4. The real title of our treatise The Guide scarcely anything in Halevi's work, which, in that time, might be considered, with D. Kaufmann, as specifically $ûfic (Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attri butenlehre, Gotha 1877, cf. Index s. v.). 25 But cf. below p. 444. 26 Or, of course, of a work which has excerpted these and other works (cf., for instance, how the Ihyâ' is dealt with, below on p. 456 f.). Cf. below pp. 444 f.; 452:454; 456 f.; 465: 472 ff.; 479 f. 2' The question of the title of the presumed larger work (cf. above p. 435, note 9) seems to me somewhat complicated. Whilst the title of the treatise we are dealing with, is beyond any doubt al-murHd ilâ at-tafarrud etc.,■we read at the beginning of the manuscript: "This is the book: The Guide to the correct Practice of the derek ha-hasîdût (al-murHd ilâ tahkîk derek ha-h"sîdût)." Later on, when the same words reappear, the necessary article of mursid is missing, so that one is tempted to construct: ta(qr)îra(î) mufytasarin mursidin ilâ . . . "the composition of an abridged treatise leading to ... " Then the words at the beginning might have been derived from this passage though without much justification. Else, we should be obliged to assume that in the second place the article has been left out by mistake. The words Makâlat derek ha-hasîdût as given in Ms. or. Hunt 489 (cf. above p. 435, note 10. Note especially the second mentioning of these words, ibidem.), are evidently only a short title of reference, which presented itself quite naturally.</page><page sequence="10">442 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [10] to Isolation, and That which through Isolation28 leads to Detachment (1al-mursid ilâ at-tafarrud wa-l-mufrid2&gt; ilâ at-tajarrud) points to one of the main topics of the Way to Piety, which, as is well known, has been one of the pillars of Sûfism. One of the other works of our author also has a title modelled on the pattern of Sûfism: The Dawkîyât,29 his commentary on the Psalter, in which the inner meaning of the Psalms is disclosed30 and all concealed things and secrets are revealed,31 were surely intended to explain those passages of the Psalms, of which the real meaning can be grasped only through personal mystical experience, "taste" (dawk).32 The "Way to Piety" which, in accordance with rationalistic conceptions, embodies the perfection of the practical power of the soul, "Wisdom" Qiokmâh) being that of the theoretical power, is marked by "stations" (makâmât), a genuine Sûfic conception. The "knowing one" ('ârif) who "walks" (sâlik) on the "path" (tank) towards hasîdût,33 procédés from one "station" or, accord ing to another simile: from one "step" (darajah) of the "ladder" (sullam), to the next higher. The different "stations" are given in a Talmudic quotation, but inherently, they conform to the Sûfic stages on the way to God, since cleanliness, separation, humility and fear have a prominent part in this passage of Jewish literature. The quotation, attributed to Pînhâs b. Yâ'îr, is to be found in 'Ab. Zarah 20b.34 Another version of the same saying 28 At both occurrences, in the beginning and in chapter III, this word is corrected, in my opinion without any reason, to al-murfid "the Helper." 29 The sound d (although this would not be necessary to enlighten us as to the meaning of this word), is marked in Ms. or. Hunt. 489, fol. 95a, by a point over the Daleth. 30 Ms. or. Hunt. 447, fol. 19b ( = Hunt. 486, fol. 50a). 31 Ms. or. Hunt. 447, fol. 31a ( = Hunt. 486, fol. 82b). 39 A title of a work of as-Suhrawardî al-Maljtûl (d. 1191) may illustrate the Sûfic character of this title: al-kalimât ad-dawfctyah wa-n-nikât as-lawkîyah (cf. Brockelmann, GAL, Suppl. I, p. 783 and H. Corbin, Suhrawardî d'Alep, Publ. de la Soc. des Études iraniennes 16, 1939, p. 46. See also below p. 483 f., notes 150 and 152). 33 In al-Gazzâlî's Munkid, for instance, the Sûfîyah is described as those who walk in the path of God (ed. Damascus2 1353/1934, p. 131). 34 For the convenience of the reader, the whole passage concerned may be given here: שלא יהרהר אדם ביום ויבוא .(Dt. 23.10) ת"ר: ונשמרת מכל דבר רע</page><page sequence="11">[11] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 443 exists in the Mishnah Sot. IX, 14 end.35 But although in the treatise with which we are dealing, the full wording of the quota tion was mentioned at the very place where now the manuscript shows a lacuna,36 it seems to be a reasonable assumption that among the versions known to us, the passage of 'Ab. Zarah has been followed closest. Not all the "stations" suggested by this Talmudic passage are treated in our manuscript,37 but all the items are found only in 'Ab. Zarah in this manner. There, fyasîdût is mentioned again at the end of the saying as the highest virtue and '"nâwâh helds the seventh place, just as in the treatise we are dealing with.38 Unfortunately, owing to the lacuna, we can not always recognize in what minor details the author has altered the saying — nekîyût is mentioned after p'rîsût, in conformity with what is found in Bahya. It may have been attracted by toh0râh which follows perîsût (cf. also the sequence of the stations in Mishnah Sot.). And 'anâwâh follows holiness as in Mishnah Sot.39— and how he explains that love, the highest station in the treatise, is not mentioned in this Rabbinic passage. לידי טומאה בלילה. מכאן אמר ר' פנחס בן יאיר: תורה מביאה לירי זהירות, זהירות מביאה לידי זריזות, זריזות מביאה לידי נקיות, נקיות מביאה לידי פרישות, פרישות מביאה לירי טהרה, טהרה מביאה לידי חסידות, חסידות מביאה לידי ענוה, ענוה מביאה לידי יראת חטא, יראת חטא מביאה לידי קדושה, קדושה מביאה לידי רוח הקדש, רוח הקדש מביאה לידי תחיית המתים, ופלינא דרבי יהושע .(Ps. 89.20) וחסידות גדולה מכולן, שנאמר: אז דברת בחזון לחסידיך .Is. 61.1 :בן לוי דאמר ר' יהושע בן לוי: ענוה גדולה מכולן, שנאמר 35 This passage is quoted in jer.

TV! f.), and another different version quoted in Abraham b. Dâ'ûd's Emûnâh râmâh (ed. by S.

The stage of this love is reached, when the lover says: "I am my Beloved, and my Beloved is I."41 Or (here and in the following the author mentions exactly that which as-Sarrâj adduces when explaining, among other difficult Sûfic expressions, the use of the phrase: anâ anta wa-anta anâ*2) he expresses the same idea by quoting famous verses which are mostly, but not by as-Sarrâj and our author, attributed to al-Hallâj (d. 922) : "I am whom I love, and whom I love is I. When thou seest me, thou seest us both. We are two spirits together in one body With which God has clad us as a corporeal dwelling."43 Hunt. 489, fol. I35a, he quotes expressly 'Ab. Zarah: יראת חטא מביאה לידי ענוה! 40 The conceptions "light" and "illumination," however, enjoy a pro minant position in the doctrines of some different ؛؛ufis, so that too definite a statement based only on them would be preposterous. But as-Suhrawardi's ideas are patent in our text. The use of the tenth form of the root srk is very peculiar in the sense required, but the correctness of this formation in our text is assured through its frequent repetition. Its meaning might as well be interpreted simply as "to be illuminated," analogous to istandra. \srk X: Hilyah, Vol. X, p. 97 (al-Mufifisibi).] 41 (supra lin. ان النفس زى احر الءامات (المقدمات • • • (fol. 49) قد ستغرق فى حثه يحيث لا _بقا له\ شعور ذا ها ولا يحثها اذ الحب ُصل الى مقام ُقول فيه؛ ١ يا محثوءى ومحبو؛ى ا*يا رئو&gt;أسمةثمآ ٠ 42 Kitab al-luma' أم at-ta$awwuf, ed. by R.

And Thou hast brought me near to Thee, so that I believed that Thou art I."44 These verses are preceded by the story of two lovers, one of whom fell into the water and the other threw himself into it, confessing when brought ashore that he thought he was the other.45 This story is followed by the saying of a wise man that perfect love is reached when one says to the other: "O, I."46 All this is true of love amongst creatures— "how great, then, ought to be the love for the Creator of the creatures!"47 These few glimpses into the Sûfic background of the treatise with which we are dealing, will suffice. Among the related Jewish ideas which presented themselves to our author, the very signif icant Talmudic passage which provides the skeleton of the work, has already been mentioned. In general, our author, as we should expect, depends completely on the so-called allegorical rational istic interpretation of the Bible and the later Jewish literature, as will be evident throughout the analysis of the treatise.

In the first place he says: "The pole (kutb) of this book revolves about the stations (makâmât) and the states (ahwâl) of the soul, when it is walking in the way of God and reaches (wusûl) the highest level (al-gâyah al-kuswâ) of the love of God, the Light of the lights and the Secret of secrets, and when it is longing (iltiyâk) for this goal.48a And because this is a subtle subject (ma'nâ latîf) and a noble matter (amr sarîf), the Wise One (the author of Canticles) produced this in an enigmatic manner which the prophets and the wise men used to employ for important and concealed subjects and obscure and sublime matters. He put this into the form of the love of the concupiscent soul for one of the sensual objects of love of the created world." And in the second passage, he expresses himself in the following manner: There is no doubt that the author of Canticles wanted to reach, through the self (dât) of his soul and reason, the self of the real Beloved (al-maJ1bûb al-hakk) whom the reason and the soul desire and love (ta'sakuh). For the pole of this book in its entirety is the first Beloved, and the love ('isk) of the rational soul for Him on account of the recognition of His superiority (1min al-ifdâl lahiï)$h and the longing for Him and the walking4' towards Him.50 Since the publication of the Arabic text of the treatise is out of the question, a detailed analysis of its contents may here be given.

Its author begins with the verse 'Let me know Thy ways, 0 God, teach me Thy paths (Ps. 25.4).' Then, he says: Praise be to God who is so exalted by the greatness of His Oneness that he cannot be compared with accidents and substances; Who is so holy in the exaltedness of His firmness (samadîyah)53 that he cannot be connected with imaginations and thoughts; Who is so remote in the sublimity of His perpetuity that he cannot be confronted with sagacities and speculations.54 Who, because of the perfection of His might, does not need to be contrastéd to things which might resemble (Him) and be similar (to Him). He is the Knowing One, from whose knowledge nothing escapes of what is deposited in the conscience (sarâ'ir) and of what is hidden in the recesses of the mind (damâ'ir). He is the Great One, the lights of whose majesty have been the objects of the deep speculations of the former and the latter ones. And the salutation of peace be upon His wor shipers, the clear lights, and the shining luminaries and the mighty intellects (al-'ukûl al-kawâhir), and His messengers and His prophets, both the secret ones (bawâtin) and the visible ones (zawâhir)." 51 Neubauer erroneously gives 21 as the number of the chapters. Uri is almost right in his reckoning of 25 chapters. In fact, the word "chapter" is found 26 times, but we noticed that a chapter which has been considered as one chapter, is the beginning and the end of two chapters. 52 It is evident that our author used more Arabic sources than I was able to make out (or an Arabic work, in which many different sources had been used, cf. above p. 441, note 26). I wish to express the hope that those who dis cover other sources when reading this paper, might publish their discoveries, or, at any rate, communicate them to me. No comment is needed on the fact that the correct translation of the text is tied up with that of the context of the sources used. 53 "Impénétrabilité" is the translation of this word (derived from Kur'ân Sûrah 112.2), which L. Massignon uses (Passion II, p. 645). m al-ahdâk wa-n-nawâzir.

First Chapter (fol. 2a-3b): The rational soul—"i.e., the spiritual, luminous, divine essence which is attached to the human "temple"58 which it governs and in which it com mands"59—has two powers, a theoretical one {'alldmah) and a practical one ('ammâlah). The theoretical power procures for the soul a right and perfect understanding. The practical enables it to govern the body in the best way. Correspondingly, the duties (miswôt) are divided into a speculative (nazarî) group and a practical ('amalî) group. The speculative group gradually procures perfection of the specula tive power for the soul which, from the beginning, had no knowl edge at all (cf. Job 11.12). This perfection consists of the knowl edge of the arrangement of the realities (hakâ'ik) to the extent that man is able60 to raise himself towards the self (dât) of the 55 The traces which are visible suggest the reading: al-{^ar)ib. ؛؛، al-{fa()in allabib.

This sentence, as well as some other variations, appears also in our treatise (cf. below, p. 477).</page><page sequence="17">[17] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 449 Necessarily Existent One. And the end of wisdom is the knowl edge of God, which alone is wisdom. The practical group of miswôt intends the completion of the theoretical power of the soul both by outward (çâhir) correction through the external (zahir) religious duties, and by inner (bâtin) correction through the abolition of the vices and the cultivation of exalted and splendid virtues. This, in reality, is the complete and agreeable Way to Piety, in which detachment from lowly bodily attach ments (at-tajarrud 'an al-'alâ'ife ad-danîyah al-badanîyah) is attained in being adorned by the ornament of the exalted Truth (al-hakfr = God) ; and then, the detached luminous forms and the clean and pure material forms are revealed. The main pur pose of the practical part of the miswôt is the love of God, the attachment to the most exalted Excellence (al-janâb al-a'lâ) and the longing for Him (cf. the expression of the lord (sayyid) of the former and the latter ones, the interlocutor (kalim) of the Master of the worlds": Dt. 6.5; 11.1, or the expression "of the prince (gitrîf) of the walking and the leader (ra'is) of the knowing, of those who seek illumination": Ps. 31.24). Further, Dt. 11.13 proves that the purpose of obeying the divine laws is the attain ment of the love of the Necessarily Existent One. Second Chapter (fol. 3b-4b): This love is the highest goal (as "the lord of those who confess the Oneness of God (mu'ah hidîn) and the prince of the sedulous and the leader of the detached, the isolated" says Is. 41.8; and as "the lord of the wise men and the peer of the virtuous men" says Cant. 8.6). It is reached only by spiritual withdrawal (naz' al-arwâh = ecstasy), by assimilation to the phantoms (at-talabbuh bi-1-asbâh), by stripping (inhilâ') oneself of one's humanity, and by assimi lation (tamattul) to the spiritual world. He who attains perfection of the speculative power, is called wise (hâkâm, cf. Prov. 23.15; 19.20). He who is in the possession of the practical virtues, who is gifted with sublime qualities of character, adorned with the beautiful ornament, and qualified with the fine attribute (?ifah), who is assiduous in the use of the practical power, and who tries to ascend to the highest degree (gâyat al-marâkï) — he is called pious (liâsîd). He in whom these two qualities are united, is called îs J1asîdîm (cf. Dt. 33.8) "i. e., the leader of the detached (mujar</page><page sequence="18">450 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [18] radîn), and the dignitary (sarîf) of those who seek illumination, and the prince of those who seek divine union."61 Third Chapter (fol. 4b-6b) : Three derivations of the word Jiâsîd, hasîdût, are possible. The first and most common ety mology is that from hesed we-'met "kindness (piety) and fidelity." This would mean a man of good qualities and perfect virtue who aspires to become virtuous and upright and whose soul tends to acquire perfection and excellence and, thereby, prepares itself for happiness. The second etymology starts from the word hesed meaning shame, disgrace, contempt. Then, hâsîd would be a man who holds in contempt all except the Beloved of his soul, who despises what is spiritually defective, who thinks little of bodily things and the objects of sensual perception as such. For he aspires to spiritual advancement (takaddum), and remoteness (tanazzuh = transcendency), and he seeks illumination from the primeval world. It is in this sense that we must interpret the saying of Sim'ôn b. Lâkîs: "He who sits fasting (in a wider sense: practices asceticism) is called pious ; he treats himself well and is a man of grace."62 (This might be approximately the meaning of the words as given in the text. Our author, however, interprets them in a different manner). Besides, the derivation from this meaning of hesed implies that people think little of him because he opposes them, that they abuse him because he goes a way different from theirs, and that in their opinion he is contemptible (cf. Is. 53.3, 7). The third derivation, to which our author inclines and which caused him to give to his book the aforementioned title alluding to isolation, is that from hasîdâh "stork" which, ad Lev. 11.19, is explained by Abraham b. Ezra63 "as the name of a bird which 61 As a Biblical quotation for the word is meaning "leader," the words הלא אתה איש ישראל are given ( = 1 Sam. 26.15 ?), and, in margine, Judg. 7.14. Is, according to our author, designates also the בן נביא. The author had in tended to resume this subject afterwards, but does not do so explicitly in our manuscript. 62 כל היושב בתענית נקרא חסיד גומל נפשו איש חסר, cf. the dictum Ta'an. lib [Prov. 11.17] where another interpretation is necessary. 63 In his commentary on Lev. 11.19, Abraham b. Ezra merely says that the basîdâh appears at fixed times of the year. He adds that some scholars derive it from fiesed "piety", a derivation which, as is known, is widely ac</page><page sequence="19">[19] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 451 lives (ya'wâ) in deserts and solitudes, and isolates itself from other birds and appears in the inhabited region only at a fixed time of the year." Thus, fyâsîd would designate the man who is alone unto himself (munfarid bi-hâlih), who detaches himself (mutajarrid) from mankind for the purpose of doing his work, who seeks solitude (mustawliis) far from them and shuns them, "like the bird which flies in the deserts and eats from the tops of the trees and drinks from the fountains. And when dusk grows, it takes refuge in its nest and seeks the company of its Master and solitude from His creatures."64 Such is the hâsîd■ He is always solitary (munfarid), alone (wafyîd), grieved (mahzûn) and dispirited (masjûri) because of the aversion of human créa tures for the Truth and their corruption; because of their pre occupation with the world, their love for it and their delight at its false allurements. All this causes him much grief, trouble, and sorrow, so that he becomes alone, isolated, solitary unto himself (bi-J}âlih) and detached for the sake of his own work. So much for the bodily "temple." As to the soul, this etymology means that it is separated and absent (gâ'ibah) from its powers, and directed to its deeds. Absence means in the opinion of those who walk and seek illumi nation, the perfect devotion of the soul to its ruler Çâmilihâ), cepted, but not proved. Cf. L.

Absence (gaybah) means presence in the absent world (Jî l-gayb), and presence of the senses means absence from the world of holiness,65 as the poet says: "If he is distant, He torments me, and if He is near, He frightens me. If I am absent, He appears, and if He appears, He makes me absent."66 Fourth Chapter (fol. 6b) : There are eight combinations of the qualities "wisdom" and "piety" in men.67 Firstly, there is the wise man (hâkâm), the scholar (ba)1J1ât) who is engaged in specu lation and research, far advanced in philosophy (hikmah), but does not seek divine union and illumination, and does not walk in the Way of Piety. Secondly, there is the pious man (hâsîd), all of whose efforts are concentrated on knowledge ('irfân), who is far advanced in spiritualization (tarawhun) and is engaged in the search for illumination, but does not do research and speculation in philosophy. The third type, hâkâm wehâsîd, unites in himself the search for divine union and illumination and the penetration into philosophy by research and speculation. In the fourth type, hâsîd hâkâm, it is the speculative ability which is found to a lesser degree; in the fifth type, hâkâm hâsîd, it is the mystic ability which is deficient. The description of the sixth kind starts with the words: "He who learns and tries to do re 65 Until a closer parallel is found, cf., e. g., rawd ar-raydkin, 272nd story. 66 (Mujtatt) ءردى (text: درى; supra lin.) ان 'ا ى عذ _رنى وان دنا (only traces visible ؛يت يا وان يا ءسى' (text: ان; supra lin.) اذا of غيي).

Then, as mentioned above, we meet with a lacuna. When the text goes on, we encounter the second explanation of z'hîrût which constitutes the first station on the Way to Piety. Fifth68 Chapter-(fol. 7a-b): The second explanation of the meaning of z'hîrût, as derived from Dan. 12.3 or Ezek. 8.2, is "illumination." Consequently, zâhîr means a man who seeks illumination, i. e., enlightenment (tanwîr) of his soul and illumi nation of his spirit by luminous ideas (sawânih), divine sparks (lawâmi')69 and intellectual flashes (bawârik ; at the margin h instead of b, thus meaning "miracles." This correction is found throughout the text.). At the same time, his reflection is taken up with the "kingdom" (malakût). Simultaneously, he is engaged in recollection (dikr) of God, being humbly obedient (hudiV) and subtly (lafif) intent on the world of Holiness. He takes little food, and does not sleep during the night, his external conscious ness becoming brilliant (! ? fa-talawwuh li-sirrih az-zâhir) in order to become more exalted and to be transferred from a lower to a higher state (hâl), and to a station more elevated and higher than the former. Through such efforts he is prepared for the reception of "this holy illumination and this divine idea (as-sânih al-lâhûtî) and this ray which comes from the 'kingdom' (as-su'â' al-malakûtï)This illumination causes movement (a movement which on its part reacts upon illumination). Therefore, the second station, as the Sages said, is z'rîzût "quick movement." Sixth Chapter (fol. 7b-8b): The first meaning of z'rîzût is quick movement, skill (nahrîrîyah), and activity (nalâtah) (Çid. 22b; Mak. 23a; Targûm70). The zârîz, therefore, is a man who moves with the power of resolution (qûwat al-'azm), when walking in the Way to Piety. 68 From this chapter onwards, the number of the chapters naturally refers to the preserved ones. It may be that a whole chapter is lacking, although this is not very likely. ،٠ For the very common use of lawaih, fawdli', and lawdrni' in the mystical language, cf. al-I£usayri in his Risdlah, B_k 1284/1867, p. 52.

It was said to one of the wise: 'How did you recognize your Master?'

And one of the wise said: 'God calls to account the initiated ones (hawâss) among the Faithful on account of what they have 'bound' with their hearts, and the common people ('awârnm) among the Faithful on account of what they have 'bound' with their tongues'." It is in this meaning of "tying" that zerîzût leads, according to the saying of the Sages, to p'rîsût\ for z'rîzût "tying" is syn onymous with issâr "fetter," "vow of renunciation," and neder "vow," and about the latter, it is stated in Ab. 111,13 that "vows (nedârîm) are a fence to p'rîsût." Besides this philological deduc tion from the wording of the Mishnah, he adds, however, that the station of zerîzût, without doubt, leads to p'rîsût, the next station, "because whoever applies himself to the necessary (wâjibât) and supererogatory (nawâjil) duties with 'ukûd and ,azâ'im, is enabled thereby to ascend the ladder of piety." 71 זרז האשקלוני.

Lev. 24.12; Prov. 23.32; Ezek. 34.12). The holder of this station is called parus (Shab. 13a; jer. Ber. IX, ed. Krotoschin fol. 14a, col. b). "And when you have recognized this, you must know that those who walk towards God, agree that their stations are not exempt from distraction (fark) and concentration {jam'). As to distraction, this means distraction from all except God, and this is the station of ^p'rîsût, and concentration means being in God, and this is the station of78 piety. As long as the soul is engaged in acquiring the attributes {sifât) of greatness, the predi cates (nu'ût) of perfection, and the virtues (fadâ'il) of beauty, it does not arrive at concentration. The soul remains in a certain distraction because it is speculating upon those attributes and the possibility of their acquisition (?).79 This impedes complete immersion (istigrâk). And this is the most defective degree and step of concentration, because the stations which precede p'rVsût, are steps and degrees leading to it {viz. distraction?), and what is above p'rîsût on the way to hasîdût, are steps leading to it {viz. concentration?).80 And as to the perfection of piety and its most perfect order {tabakah), it is reached only by stand ing at the door of the One, the Stable {samad), by being indif ferent to all but Him.

One of the virtuous men said, "Wisdom consists of ten parts; nine of them consist of silence, and the tenth of seclusion from the people."82 The pârûs has six advantages -— and in this paragraph the author adopts the classification of the advantages of separation given by al־Gazzâlî in the second chapter of the Kitâb al-'uzlah in the second part of the Ihyâ'. Firstly, he has time for worship and for approaching God and penetrating His secrets. Secondly, he is free from four sins, viz., calumny (gîbah), hypocrisy (riyâ'), negligence as to the command to do good and as to the prohibi tion against doing evil (as-sukût 'an al-amr bi-1-ma'rûf wa-n-nahy 'an al-munkar), and the unconscious adoption of bad qualities of character and bad actions by the human nature (musdrakat af-tab' (supra lin.-, text: af-tibâ') li(\; leg.: min)-l'ahlâk ar-radi'ah wa-l-a'mâl al-}1abîtah). Thirdly, he is free from troubles (fitan) and quarrels (fyusûmât). Fourthly, he is free from the wickedness of the people. Fifthly, the greediness of the people is withdrawn from him (i.e., he must not bother himself about social obligations), and vice versa. Since to satisfy the people is a goal which cannot be reached, it is much more appropriate for the intelligent one to be occupied with himself. Sixthly, the pârûs will not be mol ested by boring and stupid people. By his seclusion, the pârûs must — as is said in the Kitâb دع الناس جادّا وانين االه صاحا1؟.

He must not be unable to rank within the Saints of God.83 He must be completely detached from earthly things and concentrate on the worship of God ; he must be always bent on acquiring knowledge ('ilm) and aim at action ('amal), recollection (dikr) and reflection (fikr), so as to be able to enjoy the result of seclusion (,uzlah). This can be done "either by con tinuous prayer (wird), recollection and devoutness (hudûr al-kalb), or by reflection on the greatness, the name(s),84 the attributes, the perfection, the majesty (jabarût), the beauty, the royalty (mulk), the kingdom (malakût), and the superiority (ifdâl)*** of God, or by reflection on the minute actions (dakâ'ïk al-a'mâl) and the things which corrupt the heart, and the search for the means of release (tahallus; Ihya : tahassun) from them.

Ber. IX (Krotoschin, fol. 14a, col. b), in so far as the last two kinds of perûsîm are perûs yir'âh ke'Iyyôb and perûs ahabâh ke'Abrâhâm.s7 By this, three kinds of seclusion (i'tizâl) are indicated. The first with five subdivisions more closely studied in the next chap ter has as its reason the passion for glory (?),88 hypocrisy,89 and the search for worldly goods by cunning and seclusion.90 The second is based on fear, and the third on love and longing for God. As to these kinds of seclusion, three presuppositions (mukad damât) have to be made. Firstly, whoever searches for the divine breaths (= gifts: an-nafaJ1ât al-ilâhîyah) and the holy ideas (as-sawânih al-kudsîyah) with a clean heart and a clean soul, can partake of them (cf. Zech. 3.7). Secondly, there is no cogent proof that the human soul is one in kind, but the pre vailing opinion is that it is different in kind. So it happens that in some individuals the soul is completely prepared for divine illumination, while in others it is not at all prepared, and be tween these extremes of perfection and non-being, there are varying degrees of power and weakness. Thirdly, there are four different kinds among those who seek seclusion ('uzlah and i'tizâl). The first group includes those who study the divine sciences and the secrets of the religious law ( = theology) fer vently, and, thus arriving at the divine region (al-jânib ar rabbânî) and the spiritual world and the luminous kingdom, are caused to seek seclusion. This group corresponds to "those separated out of love like Abraham."

The third group includes those who have such a natural inclination which they render perfect by studying. Finally, the fourth group includes those who have neither natural disposition nor learning. They have but heard of the perfect state of seclusion, and they imagine themselves to be in seclusion. But their seclusion is seclusion only in its outward appearance (zâhiran), not in its real inner meaning (bâtinan). This group corresponds to the five subdivisions mentioned in the dictum of the Sages. Ninth Chapter (fol. 13a- 15a) : This is a more detailed explana tion of the different kinds of perûsîm according to the quoted saying, starting predominantly from the linguistic point of view. Fear and love, it is said, will be explained at length in their appropriate place. "Love is delight caused by imagination of the presence of the Beloved." Somebody has said, "Love cannot be explained in words." It is said, "Love is a lit fire of God which rises over the hearts (cf. Cant. 7.7 and 8.6)."1י Since it is the ultimate goal, it is made the end of the treatise (hâtimat al-kitâb). Tenth Chapter (fol. 15a-18b): The fourth station is nekîyût "cleanliness" (ihlâs).92 It means purification of speculation from وأل.محبث ١ ُتهاج ُتصور حضرْ أل.حبوب ٠ ووال ل*ضهم : ألوثة 1لآ لا *نمر ء؛ها مءالة* وقيل؛ ألمحبة دار 1للمه المرقدة التي طنم ءاى (cf.

It is said, 'Knowledge is seed, and action is the grown crop, but the water [required for growth] is cleanliness.' One of the Sages used to say, 'Do not be deceived (text: ttgtrw; leg. tagtarru) by the purity (in marg.: bi$afa'\ text: bs') of servant ship ('ubudiyah), because servantship implies forgetting of Mastership (rubu btyah).

Knowledge must not concern itself with objects of imagination and sensual perception. The will must be above human pleasures (buzûz), lusts, wrath and appetite for eating, drinking, coitus, clothing, and gazing [upon beautiful objects] (nazar). One of the Wise said, "Whoever cares about what enters his stomach, is worth as much as what comes out of it." We must have the intention of belonging to God and of being near Him, although most people in his time, the author com plains, are overcome by their desires and do not recognize what they ought to do. The approach to the Absolutely Remote One is possible only for those human beings who are themselves as remote as it is possible for them to be (cf. Num. 16.5). Thus, they come to the knowledge of God (al-hakk) who is one, holy, absolutely certain, remote and pure. Cf. Is. 6.3, which verse, containing the triple occurrence of the word "Holy" must be interpreted in the sense that God "is remote from the attach ments (lawaliik) of the three (worlds), viz. the world of majesty (jabarût) — that is the world of reason — the world of kingdom (malakût) — that is the world of soul — and the world of royalty (mulk) — that is the corporeal world,93* for these three worlds are infected with imperfection. The rest of this chapter and the next deal exclusively with holiness, though holiness is not expressly designated as a special "station." The throne of God is remote and holy (cf. Ps. 47.9), as are the heaven (cf. Dt. 26.15), the Angels (cf. Ps. 89.8; Dan. 8.13), the speech of God (cf. Jer. 23.9), His prophets, the priests and Levites (cf. 2 Kings 4.9), and everyone who worships volun tarily, and the whole of Israel. In general, whoever is referred to as holy, must strive after the highest degree of human remoteness.

In him, the flashes of the kingdom (1al-bawârik al-malakûtîyah) will be lit, and the ideas of holiness (1as-sawâni\\ al-kudsîyah) will come to him, as is indicated in Is. 57.15. There, dakkâ' and s'fal rûah mean the man who is remote and not haughty, and sacred and not arrogant and stupid. Eleventh Chapter (fol. 18b-20a) : The starting point in becom ing remote (tanzîhât) and in ascending the ladder leading to holiness is hunger and vigiles, both very often praised in the Bible. They have a reciprocal influence upon each other, since vigiles are impossible, when a man is satisfied. Hunger dimin ishes the blood of the heart and renders it white; in its whiteness is its illumination (wa-fî bayâdihî tanwîruhû).n Vigiles cleanse the heart and increase the effect of hunger. "Thus the heart becomes like a glittering star and a polished mirror; in it, the perfection, beauty, and exaltedness of God (al-hakfr) will shine and gleam with divine lights."94« "One of the virtuous men of our(!) religion said, 'Four qualities lead man to piety: Contrac tion of the stomach by hunger, vigiles, silence, and seclusion'."" Cf. Ta'an. 24b bottom. The heart, however, is connected with the soul. Consequently, if it becomes clean, the soul, likewise, becomes clean and grows more lucid. And if one is perfect in cleanliness and remoteness which lead to divine conceptions and holy rays, he despises the material things of this world, in so far as he is in it, not in so far as he belongs to the things created. And thus, he becomes most modest and humble. These last words furnish the author with the transition to the next station: "and holiness leads to humility" (as in the Mishnah Sôt.). Twelfth Chapter (fol. 20a-23a): The seventh (!; see above p. 443) station is '"nâwâh, "i.e., humility (tawddu'), lowliness 9,1 Cf.

Humility produces illumination and vice versa. Compare Ps. 22.27 f., where lêbâb means the rational soul (cf. Eccl. 1.16), and "eating (and drinking)" refers to food of the soul which is especially for the humble and the other pious men (cf. Ps. 23.5; Ezek. 3.3; Is. 12.3), although the soul is connected with the bodily "temple." Therefore, it is said in this place, "Your heart will live forever." In the following verse (Ps. 22.30), however, perishable food is hinted at, and therefore, it is said, "And his soul is not living." Consequently, when a person increases the sublimity and illumination of his soul, he increases the humility and lowliness of his "temple." As an example of the virtue of humility,96 Moses is named as one who in spite of his high position (Ex. 19.3) was "very humble" (Num. 12.3). Again many passages of the Bible are cited, where the humble one is described as near to God and heard and well guided by Him (Is. 42.19; 53.7; 61.1; Ps. 25.9; 51.19; 131.1), as well as passages describing the bad fate of the man of contrary habits (Is. 2.11; 5.15; Prov. 16.5). Humility is evoked by comparison of the exalted rank of God with human lowliness, and he who lives humbly, is nearer to his Master whose compassion (ra'fah) will reach him necessarily (cf. jer. Shab., ed. Krotoschin fol. 3b, col. a; a Midrâs to Dt. 30.12;97 and Is. 55.1. In the last passage, water for the thirsty is to be compared with knowledge for the humble.98 "Like as 56 The passage concerning Moses' humility is often quoted. Cf., e. g., Ned. 38a; Joseph b.

Thirteenth Chapter (fol. 23a-24b): Humility produces fear of God. Consequently, the eighth station is yir'âh "fear." Fear is grief of the soul owing to the horrible things which might hap pen to it in the future. To treat "fear" in all its different aspects, the author states, is impossible in this "abridgment." There are three degrees (darajah) of fear. The first degree which is a condition for the existence of the other two degrees, is the fear of sin (ma'âsî), yir'at hêt' (cf. Job 6.21). The middle degree is constituted by the fear that God (al-hafrk) might watch one's conscience (sartrah) in the state of carelessness (gaflah) about God. This causes separation from God and acts as a veil be tween him and God (firâk and inhijâb) (cf. Gen. 3.10; Ps. 130.4). The highest degree is the fear of God for His Self's sake (ft dâtih) because of His exaltedness ('ulûw sa'nih). The second and third degrees are those of the pious and holy men. But the real fear of the pious man is the fear of being sep arated from God. He must raise himself above the common opinions of the learned (?), and gradually abandon vulgar humanity so as to become independent of the prejudices inherent in tradition.100 If not, his inner state is not true; for he knows only the bodily lusts (laddât) which are false, alluring, and ani mal. But the pleasures (laddât) of the pious are attained only by them. Their happiness is attained only through the love of God, which is attained through knowledge. Knowledge is attained through reflection which is accomplished by the abandoning of worldly desires, desires which can be most easily subdued by the fear of God. 99 This is taken from a Jewish source (Ta'an. 7a), quoted also by Semtob b. Falaguera, Sefer ham-ma'Hdt, p. 54. 190 (1) ادم ءن &lt;ضيض العامة الذي سا (add. in tnarg.) وان ض ورحزح ءيلأ (ق.يلأأ) ءن البثرة والدمح.ما ذيكو0 اءترافه (1) عن ضرورة اكآلد ٠٠٠ اءترانه seems dubious to me.

"Know that the fyâsîd wants God not for any aim apart from Him, and not for any in ten tion except Him. If he wants His knowledge and His love and the delight of looking at His noble face, he is deficient in piety. But whoever wants God for His Self's sake (li-dâtih), attains the most perfect degree of piety. For perfection is lovable for itself, and the more complete the perfection, the stronger the love of God and the more complete the immersion into Him and the abandoning of all except Him. Thus, man becomes indifferent to his self (dât), and even to his love, and it is as if there is no knowledge left to him but that of the Beloved alone (cf. Ps. 149.5, to be explained: "The pious rejoice at the majesty of God, not at anything apart from him"•, Lam. 3.24; Ps. 16.5; 119.57)." Here, some remarks are inserted about a station preparatory to piety, that of the saddîkîm, the just (cf. Ps. 118.20). That the pious man finds God, is stated in Ps. 32.6, where, after meso', the pronoun ôtekâ has been left out (cf. 2 Sam. 23.5, where hifst is intended in lieu of hêfes). The words rak I'setef mayîm rabbîm hint at his being attached exclusively to God (al-jânib al-a'la), and at his lack of further concern about existent things. These, being perishable or dissolvable and passing, are compared with water which likewise passes away (cf. Ps. 18.17; Job 6.15; Josh. 7.5). There are three classes (tabakât) of piety, indicated in Is. 44.3-5. The highest consists of those who serve God for His own sake, not for anything apart from Him (cf. Ps. 25.5; 86.11; Is. 26.9). The second consists of those who serve Him on account of one of His qualities (cf. Ps. 65.2; 92.2; Jer. 10.7). The third and most deficient class consists of those who serve Him so that their souls may become perfect through relation with Him (bi-l-intisâb ilayh) (cf. Ps. 116.16). Fifteenth Chapter (fol. 26b-31a): Piety (and the benê han n'bVîm we-ham-mitnabbe'îm) is based on the subduing of the animal to the rational soul.

Secondly, by music {alij,ân) which commands the powers of the soul (al-mustahdimah li-kuwâ an-nafs), as Elisha experienced when once his inspiration had left him.103 Thirdly, by exhortation. How the man who exhorts, must be disposed, is to be found in Ta'an. 16a bottom.103 The eleven items given in this passage are somewhat lengthily explained. Thus, with regard to the fourth point, the author says, "מטפל(!) ואין לו, i. e., trouble oneself about a thing in an unselfish manner.104 By this is meant that one must concern oneself about the maintenance of one's family and dependents, but without expecting any reward, since in doing so one turns to, and trusts in God, to a much greater degree than otherwise. It is said, 'A weak man (da'îf) stood at the door of an ascetic (murtâd), and said, 'I am hungry.' The latter replied, 'Turn back, you liar. For hunger is a secret of God, which He entrusts only to the trustworthy'.'105 Further, he who turns to the world of joy and to the 'mine' of gaiety, has to commence his journey by turning away from all except God, the middle of his path being going 101 Self-examination [murdkabah and murd'at allzalb min aljfawdpir wa-l-'awd/id) before prayer is recommended in as-Sarraj's Kitdb alluma', 102 Cf. 2 Kings 3.15, quoted again in Chapter XVIII. ג" In our manuscript, the text reads: תיד: עמדו בתפלה, א־ע פי שיש שם וקן וחכם אין טורידין אלא רניל. ר' יהודה אומי: מטפל ואין לו ויש לו יניעה בשרה וביתו ריקן ופרקו נאה שפל ברן ומרוצה לעם ויש לו נעימה וקולו ערב ורניל לקרות בתורה בנביאים ובכתובים. 1 ه وليي له حيوي ٠٠&gt; (in mar g.: التكاغِا للأم والتكفل (والكفل.

If one follows this path, why should he not concern himself with the necessary things, like Abbâ Hilkîyâh, Hônî ham-me'aggël, Pînhâs b. Yâ'îr, Hananyâh b. Dôsâ, or Hillel who aimed at the highest goal of the Way to Piety?" The secret meaning of this "way" consists in concerning oneself about the necessary things without charging anyone else with any task (cf. Ps. 128.2). But, the author says, we are here not concerned with their noble stories, their subtle states (ahwâl), and their fine secrets. The sixth item (וביתו ריקן) means that the man who wants to exhort and to correct other people has to be void of sin Çabêrâh). The action of such a man has to be conformable to his word, because speaking does not imply only sounds, but meanings. The soul goes through three stages in correcting, the first two being necessary to the attainment of the third. It must have power to correct its own body and to lead its own "temple"; then, to guide and to correct family and relatives, and finally, to guide strangers and to influence them. And he whose actions are not in accordance with his words, will have no influence on the heart of others (that is the seventh item: ופרקו נאה). In connection with the eighth item (שפל ברך), humility is mentioned again, and the distress of the haughty is described. "The soul of the haughty and stupid man cannot be influenced, because he has left the station of servantship {'ubûdîyah) and usurped (?; text: a'dâ; leg.: idda'âï) the station of mastership (rubûbîyah) which is entitled to majesty (kibriyâ') and venera tion (ta'zlm)." The ninth item (מרוצה לעם) means the man who is liked and praised by the people for his shining states {ahwâl) and his visible virtues. They want to live as he does and to adapt themselves to his way (tarîkah). The tenth item (יש לו נעימה וקולו ערב) indicates beautiful melodies and sweet music as means for influencing the soul. The last item, finally, (ורגיל לקרות בתורה בנביאים ובכתובים) characterizes the man who aims at influencing the soul, as one who is acquainted both with the words of revelation and those of the holy and wise men and who can impart his knowledge eloquently. "Therefore, the pious men and the sons of prophets</page><page sequence="35">[35] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 467 were in the habit of resting in meadows and beside the waters, to listen to different kinds of musical instruments and the singing of the birds, because therein is to be found the key to the secrets of ascetic life." Sixteenth Chapter (fol. 31a-b) : Among the degrees of piety, the first is that of the hafësîmIOSa, i. e., those who want (murîdîn = novices in mysticism) and desire (râgibîn) (cf. Nehem. 1.11; Ps. 111.2). They know (as is indicated in these passages of the Bible) that the happiness of the soul consists in giving up all except God, when the conceptions of the Truth have reached them and they have experienced the flashes and the sparks and the illuminations and the symbolic allusions. This renders it necessary to want God, to fear Him, and to turn towards Him.106 Seventeenth Chapter (fol. 31b-32a) : "The murul, with necessity, has to be prepared and fit for this matter. Otherwise, ascetic exercise would be completely useless for him, because the result of exercise consists only in raising the veils (raf al-hujub) and removing the hindrances (izâlat al-'awâ'ik). That alone is not sufficient for reaching the intended goal (!).107 Likewise, when the murîd is not a knowing one, he unavoidably needs a person who truly causes him to walk and sincerely instructs107a him (musallik muhakkik wa-muwakkif sâdik).

Further, it is necessary that the acquaintances and companions of the murîd should be good and be bent on good deeds, thinking of the other world rather than of this one." Eighteenth Chapter (fol. 32a-36a) : Whoever desires to raise himself on the ladder which leads towards the heaven of piety, must eschew all excessive (fudûl) desires, whether they concern fortune and rank, or knowledge. He must keep to the middle path in the matter of sensual perceptions caused by the five senses. The middle path in vision is to look at what is bright and cheerful (al-alwân al-musrikah al-mumiddah li-r-rûh al-bâsitah li-n-nafs). White is best (cf. Eccl. 9.8). Equally important is gazing (nazar) at bodies which cause longing for the knowledge of God and which indicate His wisdom, but do not excite con cupiscence,109 further, looking at the circulating spheres and the wandering stars (cf. Is. 40.26; Ps. 8.4). As to taste, the middle path enjoins nutrition by small quantities of good quality. The middle path in hearing implies listening to harmonic tunes and joyful melodies which increase the inclination of the heart towards what is yearned for,110 so that it is prevented from turning to something else. It is especially useful, when music is connected with words which unfold that idea and call attention to that purpose. On account of this, music has been used by the pious and the sons of the prophets to evoke in the soul longing for their sublime (sarîf) element and their subtle (latîf) source and for immersion in the divine ocean which is near the place of virtues, joy, life, and delight (cf. 1 Sam. 10.5; 1 Chron. 16.27). The movements of the body provoked by listening to music (samâ'), are due to the illuminated ideas of the heart and the pleasures of the soul. They are according to the soul's distance or nearness to its element, and correspond in intensity to the "" (text: ؛ل supra lin.) كذاك النظر الى الأجسام المشوقة الى معرفة الاه الدالة ءلمى حكمته مع الأمان ض ?وران المهرة• ٠٢٢;&gt; , يقغف "". in marg.: إ يثق</page><page sequence="37">[37] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 469 soul's inclination to, mixture with, and appropriation of this element.111 This gives an opportunity to explain different Hebrew names of musical instruments and musical terms in regard to their ability to excite the soul in the described manner.112 "And by the lamentation of music, that which is quiet, will be moved towards the objects of painful love (?),"3 and the fires of longing will be lit in the hearts of the lovers, when mentioning the Friend of the soul and reiterating the name of the holy King, and the hearts will be helped to attain the secrets of the absent things and the lights of the Beloved.""4 As to aromas, the middle path is to be found in those that are lovely and fortifying (cf. Ps. 45.9; Cant. 5.5), and in avoiding bad smells. The pious man should dwell in a wide desert plain (çahrâ'), because the air, there, is not subject to changes. Amongst the perceptions provoked by the sense of touch, coitus had better be avoided (for this reason, Elijah and Elisha are called holy); clothing is recommended only in as far as it protects against heat and cold. In general, resort to the middle path as regards sensual per ception has to be taken in what affects those basic necessities which cannot be wholly avoided. Excess, in some way or other always prevents the attaining of the goal. This restriction helps a person to practice renunciation (zuhd) which has to be practiced from the beginning of walking, if one 111 It is clear that the whole refers to the theory and practice of samd' "audition, listening to music," followed by ecstasy. 1" Somewhat similar Joseph b.

It helps further in strength ening one's spirituality and in annihilating (mafyw) sensual desires. But this restriction and controlling of appetites must be effected not merely outwardly, since God sees the innermost recesses of the heart and the thoughts and aspirations concealed therein (cf. 1 Sam. 16.7; Jer. 11.20; 17.10; 20.12, and Ps. 11.4). Nineteenth Chapter (fol. 36a-36b) : At any rate, it is obvious that sensual perception can be controlled. Otherwise, an approach to the remote Matter (al-amr al-garîb) would be impossible for the souls. The sensual powers cannot force the rational soul and prevent it from turning to its holy world. Cf. the verse: "Let it be heavenly, according to destiny (?). Do not mix it up with an earthly opinion of yours.""5 If the conscience (sirr) is subtilized (luttifa), the soul is ready for the holy world, leaving the sensual world, detached from the world of negligence ('âlam (in marg.) al-gafalât). Two things are helpful for this purpose, subtle (latîf) reflection and chaste {'(ifif) love. Twentieth Chapter (fol. 36b-39a): When the pious man has covered the wide distance of his path, the path of asceticism (riyâdah), he arrives at a very high station which cannot be compared with anything (cf. Ps. 31.20), or which could be ex pressed at best only in a simile as in Ps. 63.6 and Ps. 23.5. There, heleb wâdesen "milk and fat" designate the spiritual pleasures and the divine conceptions which are pure pictures from the holy world (nufcus) engraved in the polished mirror of the soul. (For God — the author states in this place —- only semes "sun" (cf. Ps. 84.12), or aryëh "lion" (cf. Hos. 11.10) is a fitting simile, and this only approximately, because the justification of this comparison is given solely by the fact that there exists nothing greater and higher. Likewise, one may compare the divine ideas and the luminous sparks and the sparkles of Firm 115 Or, according to the reading supra linr. "Do not seek it with an earthly pain of yours." (Basil} دءيا داوية تجرى ءلى قدر منك ارض• (supra lin.: يراى (يدا (supra lin.: تخ لعدها ر_طلمنها V</page><page sequence="39">[39] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 471 ness (al-lawâmi)\ as-samadîyah) with matters which cause pleas ure by taste {dawk = experience; cf. Ps. 51.12 where this state (liât) is hinted at.) The most advanced goal of this very high station is "arrival" ('wusûl) and "union" (ittisâl), i. e., that all the knowledge of the soul disappears except that of the Beloved (cf. Ps. 39.3 f. ; 42.2; 73.25; Cant. 8.1).116 This very high station is called rûah hak kôdel "holy spirit" in the dictum of the Sages: "and piety leads to holy spirit which is greater than anything else.""7 The word "great" {gâdôl) may designate, according to the use of this word in the Bible, greatness in quality or in quantity. The first meaning is clear; it means that the station of rûah hak-kôdes is the most exalted and highest station. But "great" is applied to rûah hak-kôdes also in the second meaning. For the travel (safar) of the pious man is twofold, either he travels to or in God. The travel to God which is limited and the aim of which is the liberation of the soul from bodily attachments (lawâzim), is the subject of the aforementioned stations. The travel in God, i. e., the description of His greatness and of the qualities of His beauty, the aim of which is the perfection of the soul by divine qualities (ahlâk) and luminous virtues in accord ance with human ability and as far as is possible to bodily beings, has practically no limits. Therefore, it is greater in quantity. This travel in God is the station of rûah hak-kôdes. Twenty First Chapter (fol. 39a-41a): As to prophecy,"8 the Sages said, "Prophecy establishes itself only with a brave and rich wise man.""9 These three qualities have each a starting point and an end. The starting point of "brave" is the rule of the rational over the 116 Cf. above p. 446. 117 Cf. above p. 443, note 39. 118 As to the introduction of prophecy in this place, it may be remembered that formerly the t1asîdîm have been put on a level with the b'nê han-nebî'îm and the ham-mitnabb'Hm. «9 אין הנבואה שורה אלא על חכם נבור ועשיר. Cf. Shab. 92a (אין השכינה ... ובעל קומה), and Ned. 38a (אין הקב־ה משרה שכינתו). In the same form as is found in our treatise, this dictum is quoted repeatedly by Maimonides, Môreh II, 32; Introduction to Ab., Perefr VII, and by §em(6b b. Falaguera, Sëfer h m• ma'Hôt, p. 32.</page><page sequence="40">472 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [40] animal soul; the end of "brave" is the virtue of bravery. In the possession of this virtue, man defies even the fear of death. He knows, what a poet has expressed in these verses: "I do not deliver my soul to sicknesses which ruin it, But for the fact that I know that union will revivify it. The soul of the lover is patient of pains, One day perhaps, He who made it sick, will heal it."120 The starting point of "rich" is contentment with what God has alloted to one; the end of "rich" is liberality. The starting point of "wise" is the medium way of the theo retical power with regard to its government of life; the end of "wise" is the good arrangement of the knowledge of the realities (hakâ'ik) in the soul and the shining forth of the lights of the Truth and the conceptions of reason in the soul. Twenty Second Chapter (fol. 41a-42a) : On love. Here, as well as in the following chapter, the author has excerpted what al-Gazzâlî says about mystic love in the relevant section of his Ifyyâ' 'ulûm ad-dîn.12I "Among these stations, love is the ultimate goal, and among these degrees, it is the highest degree. After attaining love, there is no station, unless it is a result and a consequence of love, like longing, or intimacy, or satisfaction. Before love, each station is but an introduction to it. Although the other stations rarely existed, the heart of the people, however, was not exempt from the belief in their possibility. But even the belief in the possibility of love is so rare that most of the learned of this age, aye all of them, aye numerable ages, did not recognize, and considered as impossible, the assumption that love, with necessity, is possible. They said, 'Love means but the exhortation to obedience of God. 1ْل (Basil) امير النفي للامحقام مملغها (text: ؛ام supra tin.) V الأ للص آان الوصل ؛حيي ها ص الحب ءلى الألأم ماررْ لعل مسمبمها ؛وما داورها ٠ Cf. JA 218, 1931, p. 127. The last two hemistichs are also quoted by Yaft'؛ in the introduction to his محسء arraydhin (p. 15). 11ت Part IV, Book 6, in the print quoted above, Vol. IV, pp. 252-264.</page><page sequence="41">[41] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 473 Real love can exist122 but with the identical kind and with what is similar.'123 And because they did not recognize love, they also did not recognize its attachments like longing, intimacy, and secret converse with God. But you should know that the love of God is necessary according to the religious Law and to reason. As to the religious Law, love is a positive command (miswâh min miswôt 'asëh'),1H cf. Dt. 6.5. How can anything be ordered which does not exist, and how can 'love' (ah"bâh) be given the meaning 'obedience,' seeing that real obedience follows love and is its result? For real obedience, not that which is due to tradition (taklîdî), can only be reached after real love." "As to reason, we can say: Love is rendered necessary by one of five things which will be explained in the following chapter. It is clear that all these five things in perfection exist in God (al-hakk). Consequently, reason renders love for God necessary in the highest degree. God alone is entitled to absolute love; aye, there is no really beloved in the opinion of those who have real knowledge and intuition, but God. No one else is entitled to it. Thus it becomes clear that a beloved creature means one who is beloved on account of one of these five things. If it is true that they are all united in God, and that only one of them exists in another being, because they are real only in reference to God (ft hakfrih), and their existence in reference to another is but metaphorical and imaginary, then for Him, real love is necessary, and for another, only metaphorical love, contrary to what is said." Twenty Third Chapter (fol. 42a-48b): The five things alluded to in the preceding chapter are the following:125 Firstly: As a common feature in all living beings, man loves تلل Text: محح ; supra lin.: محرِح. 1لء Text: رعع الني والثل the last word being corrected (supra lin.) to سءل?? Prints: والثال. The Ithdf mentions both readings. "4 Our author here and further on substitutes Jewish expressions and quotations for the Islamic ones used by alGazzili who "explains the sawdhid allsar'." It is known that Jewish translators of Islamic works were skilful at substituting Biblical quotations for l£ur'؛in؛e ones. 1أء A short description of the five items is given first by our author and then a more detailed explanation follows, as in alGazzall's Ihyd'. It is much more convenient for us to merge the short description with the detailed explana tion, and, therefore, I have done so here.</page><page sequence="42">474 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [42] himself and the duration of his existence. Now, whoever knows himself and his Master, knows without doubt that he derives no existence from his own self, but that his existence and dura tion and perfection are due to God. As for his self, it is pure non-being and mere annihilation, because in nature nothing has stability, except the Stable One, the Self-Existent One who gives existence to all other beings. Therefore, he who knows this, neces sarily loves Him who grants him existence and duration. If not, it is a sign that he does not know his soul and his Master. The strength or the weakness of love is therefore dependent on the strength or weakness of the knowledge of one's own soul. Secondly: Another reason for love is the love of one's bene factor. Whoever recognizes this, recognizes that there is no abso lute benefactor besides God. For benefaction and liberality as a pure gift, not as a remuneration, are possible only for God. He has no aim for Himself, because He is above all aims. And the words "liberality" and "benefaction," when used not with God, are only metaphorical and false. Consequently, if love of the benefactor is considered natural, God must be loved in an abso lute manner (cf. Ps. 62.13). Thirdly: There is the love of a benefactor as such, even if one can make no immediate use of his benefactions. That such a love is natural, can be shown by the example' of two kings, both living in very remote countries; if one of them is tyrannic and bad, the other good and pious, the latter is loved everywhere on hearsay for his good deeds. Now, God is the benefactor of all creatures, because He gave them existence, bodily perfection, a fixed duration of life and eternal joy (laddah). In this place, our author makes a mistake. He overlooks the fact that the following remarks do not belong to the explanation of the third item, but constitute the explanation of the fourth item in the Ibyâ'. Therefore, a detailed explanation of the fourth item is completely missing in our treatise, and the text here as well as part of the rendering given in the following sentences, is comprehensible only by the help of the Ihyâ'. There is the love of saints and servants of God, and further, that of His prophets and pious men. They are possessors of noble qualities and high virtues. The hearts love them, and, by nature,</page><page sequence="43">[43] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 475 the souls incline to them. Their qualities are imperfectly reflected in their confused outward form, and they are meant by the expression "beauty of the inward form." The senses can per ceive only a reflection of their real being, but when the heart encounters them, it inclines to them and loves them. Their beautiful qualities can be reduced to three features, all of which are found with God to an incomparably higher degree. Those men know (Lilm) His actions, (supra lin.; text: His worlds), His messengers, and His Law, whereas God knows everything, and all bodily or spiritual actions of man indirectly emanate from Him (cf. Dan. 2.22; Ps. 7.10; 139.2; Is. 57.16; Zech. 12.1). They also have the power (kudrah) to correct them selves and the servants of God ( = mankind) by guidance and ruling. This quality of bravery and strength, as exemplified in the story of David or Samson, causes enjoyment and love on mere hearsay. But whilst man has power only over a few features, God has power over everything. Finally, they are remote and free (tanazzuh) from faults and defects. But although they are remote, real remoteness and holiness can be related only to God (cf. Is. 6.3, a verse which describes the highest goal as limitless and as one which cannot be described by outer human speech, but only by rational perception (al-idrâk al-'aklî) which is free from matter (mawâdd) and is called "inner speech" (nutk dâhiï)). If man directs his reflection to this goal and abandons sensual imaginations (hayâl), he will necessarily gain an insight into this station. (Cf. 1 Sam. 2.2. As to the deficiency of mankind, many Biblical passages are quoted again). Fourthly: There is a love, caused in man, of everything beau tiful (Jamil) because of its beauty, not because he may get a part of it. There are two kinds of beauty, that of the outward forms perceived by vision, the perception of which is common to every one Çâmm and hâss), to children and animals. The other kind of beauty is that of the inward forms, perceived by the eye of the heart and the light of intuition (basîrah), reserved for the "posses sors of hearts" (arbâb al-kulûb),"י the pious, the wise, the lovers, 126 Sâfiib al-fcalb means the man who possesses knowledge in his heart, but cannot impart it with words (as-Sarrâj, Kitâb al-luma', p. X* 0 V). Cf. p. 478, note 137.</page><page sequence="44">476 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [44] and those who are still higher than them. (A more detailed explanation is missing, see above.) Fifthly: Finally, there is a kind of love in man for those related to and similar to himself. Now, to God, there is an inner relation which cannot be expressed by comparison with forms and figures, but by inner conceptions which partly may be pro nounced,127 partly may not be written down. They remain under the cover of jealousy,128 until those who walk on the way of God and aspire towards it, become acquainted with them when they seek perfection in their attempt.12' What can be described,130 is assimilation to the divine attri butes which are intended to characterize the most perfect way of existence, but do not give the complete enumeration of attributes, passivity and changeability. We are commanded to come into the possession of high virtues from the world of light and firmness, and we have to travel within the praiseworthy divine attributes and holy predicates, such as knowledge, bene faction, benevolence, compassion, affection, and causing of emanation of the good on humanity (ifâdat al-hayr 'alâ al-halk).13I •ر 127 The text has a wrong درك • corr. in marg.: ذكر . 128 Text: اكثرْ !

But as evidently not much is missing, a whole folio can hardly be lost; it seems to be an incidental omission. This paragraph is an expansion of that which is found in the Ihya'; the following one on the soul's similarity with God is not contained in that work.</page><page sequence="45">[45] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 477 The soul which fills all parts of the body, recognizes (in the possession of these qualities), as well as God does, the real uni versais and particulars which are concealed from the senses and even from the reason. The soul takes the same position in rela tion to the body as God takes in relation to the world (cf. the Midrashic quotation, above p. 433, note 3). Because of thissimi larity with God in respect to its world and its "temple" caused by these attributes, the perfection and the goal of the soul is the assimilation to God as far as is humanly possible132 (as com manded in Dt. 28.9). What one is not allowed to write down concerning the special relation of man to God, is that which is hinted at by the use of the words "image" and "similitude" in Gen. 1.26, 27 and Ezek. 1.26 (cf. also the Midrâ§ ad Dt. 21.23).133 Those who were not able to perceive the Jiaka'ik and the divine secrets, were seduced by these passages to pure and unfounded anthropomorphism (at-tajsîm al-mahd and at-tasbîh bi-mâ la tasabbuh lahïï). God is above that which the ignorant assume and the infidels believe! By way of conclusion of the whole discussion, our author repeats that real love is justified only for God alone. Every other use of the word "love" is metaphorical. Here134 is added the praise of the loving fyâsîd: "Know that the noblest and nearest and subtlest heart and the most exalted and purest conscience is that of the loving hâsîd to whom are entrusted the treasures of the absent things1343 and with whom are deposited the way-signs (ma'âlim) of the Beloved.

Whoever becomes a confessor of unity (muwaiihid) in reality, has to be completely without any attachment, and whoever is found just in his claim1363 (da'wâ), the Truth (al-hakk) will comply with his wishes, and whoever changes (badala) his heart and feeling (fu'âd), must make devotion (taslîm 'surrender') his provision for traveling. Union (awkât al-wisâl) is better than pure water. He who is ecstatic (wâjid), is overwhelmed (hayrân), and he who loves, is intoxicated."137 Twenty Fourth Chapter (fol. 48b-51a): The words of Isaiah 26.9: "My soul I yearned for Thee in the night" are meant to call our attention to the fact that the soul, being a lucid element and a divine light, and having its perfection in assimilation to the Creator as far as is humanly possible, has to master the body and to make itself completely detached (tajarrud). In the words of Isaiah, soul, in view of the aforementioned connection between the soul and God, can be explained as a synonym of God. Then the words mean that, at the last station, the soul plunges into the love of God so that no consciousness of its self (dât) and its love remains in it. In connection with this state, there are many sayings and poems (quoted above p. 444 f.) Or, the verse Is. 26.9 must be understood as follows: "With the purity of my soul, I yearned for Thee in the night." This means that among the two kinds of objects of knowledge, the objects of sensual perception perceived by the five senses, and the simple (basâ'it), spiritual, luminous, divine, and rational 136 مح/عئسمم and muSdhadah. alGazzall, in his MunJfid, designates the ؛?ufis as the people of contemplation and revelation (ءر،ا. tit., [above p. 442, note 33], pp. 76; 132). ■3،a For da'wd in the mystic language, cf. Massignon's edition of the Kitdb at-Tawasin, No. VI. 1"Then, the author adds: (supra lin.: واءام ان الواد ض رقى Job 34.10: 1لماد ض حاد &lt;الغواد وءم الدن ار؛اب الءاوب</page><page sequence="47">[47] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 479 objects which are perceived not by a sense, but by the pure self of the soul (bi-hilâs dâtihâ), the prophets like Isaiah are prepared for the second kind.138 And the word "night" is intended to point to that state in which sensual perceptions are excluded, because the perception intended must be accomplished by the detached and pure soul without a mediator. The same is meant in Cant. 3.1 where no doubt the percep tion of the real Beloved by the self of the soul and of the reason is hinted at.139 The mentioning of the Song of Songs induces the author to repeat the statement that love is proper only in the case of him who knows the objects of knowledge (ma'ârif) and the realities (hakâ'ik). He adds 1 Chron. 28.9 for the need of worshiping God with a perfect heart and a loving Çâsik) soul in sincerety, and Cant. 8.7 for the greatness of the love of God which water cannot extinguish. In comparison with love, all the other con cerns of human existence are worth nothing.140 Twenty Fifth Chapter (fol. 51a-52a): Here, the author follows again al-Gazzâlî's Ihyâ'.1*1 The love of God for His servant, which is often mentioned in the Bible,142 cannot be comprehended in the same sense as the love of man for God. For the latter, as explained, is not meta phorical, since love (mahahbah, the other word meaning "love," 'isk, means its excess), according to the sense given by the con 13 ودا كان النجي ؤ؛لتس2آ النوم آلتر ص المرا ُى امحتغن.ت يفه ءى ة (first ١ supra tin.عن الأسمال راحلاص ر (in marg.: ن؛.اها رقى التماّّها ذا'؛ها• An obvious correction would be: (ءن الامتعال (الحواس ل نادها • 135 Cf. above p. 446. 1ذلو دل الأنان ما_ر •وجوده(!) واض 0ي (in marg.) ومع ذاك (text: أمستضا supra tin.ِلظات وحودْ فى 'نحصي.ل الحبة لكان ذلك متصءرا ز حصواها اذ ءى اجل المطالب (text: جانب; in marg.) زى جناُب الئاب• (in marg.-. وافخر زاذنحل 141 In the print quoted, Vol. IV, pp. 280-282. محءاسأ-ْتمءأ ل4ء . . . katirah, as al-GazzMi introduces his sawdhid from the Kur'an.</page><page sequence="48">480 FRANZ ROSENTHAL [48] ventionality of language (wad' al-lugah), is the soul's inclination to and pleasure in what corresponds to it. Therefore, the word "love" has another meaning when used of God, as is true of many other conceptions which, being originally appropriate with respect to human beings, may be used of God only in another sense, viz. metaphorically. Love of God for His servant is effected in two ways. It may be effected by an action; thus it is created anew whenever it is evoked ; that means the unveiling of the hearts, so that men might perceive by the intuition of their reason. Or, this love may be founded in the eternal will of God; thus, it is eternal and means that God grants His servant the possibility of walking in the ways leading to nearness to Him. He who is near God, is loved by God, the word "nearness" being intended, void of all animal attributes and gifted with noble, divine qualities, as nearness in quality, not as local near ness. "And the sign of this love is that He isolates him from all except Himself, and intervenes between him and all else besides Himself, and He makes his soul constantly warn him, and his heart exhort him. Both issue commands and prohibitions. The most exquisite sign of his love for God proves the love of God for him." Twenty Sixth Chapter (fol. 52a-56a) : A man like this is called by the Sages "sun" (semes) (cf. the saying cited in Gen. rabbâ ad 23.1 and Eccl. rabbâ ad 1.5, where the position of the sen tences is different from that adopted in the treatise we are dealing with). As the author states, all the riddles which are involved in this name, cannot be treated by him in his abridgment. But, instead of this, it is mentioned that in the Bible, the rational soul, when connected with its "temple," is called nër "light" (cf. Prov. 20.27). If the soul raises itself on the ladder of piety to the world of holiness, until it becomes similar to the sun, it is first called ôr "luminary" (cf. Prov. 13.9; Cant. 6.10). But, by nature, it is drawn downwards to the corporeal powers, the ani mal concupiscences, and then, it is called de'îkâh "extinguished" and "fëlâh "darkness" (cf. Prov. 7.9 and 13.9). The further steps in the direction of illumination are sahar "dawn," Tbânâh "moon," Jiammâh "sun," and finally the phantom of the detached</page><page sequence="49">[49] A JUDAEO-ARABIC WORK UNDER SUFIC INFLUENCE 481 reasons (sabaJi al-'ukûl al-mujarradah), meant by the word nidgâlôt "bannered" in Cant. 6.4, 10. The steps downward after nër are nesef "dusk," 'ereb yom "evening," îsôn layelâh "middle of night," and finally "fëlâh "darkness." The man who has arrived at the highest step of those just described, represents the wisdom of God on earth. He is in pos session of the clear proofs (frujaj), and he is the representative (halîfah) of God on earth. He is the leader who seeks divine union and the perplexed (al-mutawallih ; one should expect rather : mutawalli' "passionate") lover. He wields luminous guidance and divine leadership, rather than leadership in the outward sense of the word, i. e., violence and force. If the world is guided by such a man, there is light; if the age is void of his guidance, dark ness is overwhelming.142־ This is the case in the age of our author, he states, where only a few examples of real hasîdîm are left; actually, however, this group (tarîkah) of pious men has disap peared, a reason for the greatest affliction. But, in any case, the soul moving between distress caused by affliction, and damage, must look for divine compassion, so that the sublime path and the pleasant road becomes open to it.143 Then the clean souls will 1ءءا־ Cf. as-Suhrawardl, ءرءء. cit.

For whoever goes to Him, will not return without result, and whoever trusts in Him, will not do vain work. One of the Sages said that the ruin of mankind is the result of two things: Occupation with a supererogatory duty, whilst omitting a necessary duty, and action of the members, whilst the heart does not agree.147 Another said, I traveled once and brought home knowledge known by the common people and by the initiated Çâmm and hâss). I traveled a second time and brought home knowledge known by the initiated and not known by the common people. I traveled a third time and brought home knowledge known neither by the initiated nor by the common people, in possession of which I am unique (farîd, sarîd, tarîd, waliîd), because the spiritual sciences and the realities of the world of the soul and the divine secrets are opposed to most of the sciences (in marg. : intellects) of mortal creatures.

Of the short explanation which the author wants to give in his treatise, only the beginning is preserved, viz. the explanation of the first sentence of the dictum to mean that "filling the world" as applied to God does not exclude his separatedness from and superiority over it.
