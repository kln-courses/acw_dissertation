Paper Nig 59,90. Nelly Stienstra attempts to develop a synthetic methodological approach to the study of metaphor in the Bible in order to engender a conversation between biblical scholars, Bible translators, and linguists specializing in studies of metaphor. She hopes to make it easier for biblical scholars and Bible translators to study metaphor in a more systematic, responsible, and sophisticated way. From the outset, however, she brings a rather large number of debatable presuppositions to the task. She as- sumes that met√§phor is a cognitive device rather than a "mere" rhetorical device, that</page><page sequence="2">578 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 clear distinctions can be drawn between anthropomorphic language and anthropo- morphic metaphor, that "man's cognitive capacity is intrinsically and necessarily metaphorical" (p. 10), that metaphor is "culture-dependent," that "the division in pre- and postexilic biblical literature appears to be fairly uncontroversial," and that the metaphor in the book's title "expresses, more than any other, the mutual relationship between God and his people" (p. 15). Each of these presuppositions is debatable, yet the contours of these debates are not presented, and convincing arguments are not set forth to show why S.'s opinions ought to be accepted prima facie. Nevertheless, the book sets out from this presuppositional foundation to survey the main theories about the nature of metaphor. According to S., Aristotle regarded metaphor as something much more than mere rhetoric, while Aquinas tended to be skeptical, emphasizing the primacy of logic over metaphor. Locke reacted strongly to metaphor, denouncing all figurative speech, in fact, as "an imperfection and abuse of language." After painting this historical backdrop, S. proceeds to contemporary studies of metaphor. Eva Kittay and Adrienne Lehrer argue that the unit of metaphor is the semantic field, not the individual word or sentence. Max Black defines meta- phor as a linguistic device substituting for other, more literal, ways of speaking; metaphors, according to Black, can be extinct, dormant, or active. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson go further and claim that the essence of metaphor is not just under- standing, but actually experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another. The goal of this interesting survey is a synthesis of these positions which will provide a workable definition acceptable to the world of biblical scholarship. S. defines a metaphorical concept as "a conceptual metaphor that cannot be further analysed" (p. 37). In the remainder of the book she attempts to illustrate this defi- nition by focusing on one particular biblical metaphor, namely, the metaphor of Yhwh as husband, dealing in successive chapters with Israelite marriage, the marriage metaphor in Hosea, and the marriage metaphor before and after Hosea. The con- clusion contains suggestions for translating metaphor in general and the marriage metaphor in particular. The guiding star for the latter half of the book is the hypothesis that biblical metaphor "developed in the cause (sic) of time, even to such an extent that it was recognized in texts where it was not overtly present, and where it may not even have been the author's intention at all" (p. 39). Although this book is well written and didactically "user-friendly," it bristles with problems. S. relies much too heavily on David Mace's important but now com- pletely outdated work Hebrew Marriage: A Sociological Study (London: Epworth, 1953). On p. 75, for example, S. confidently cites Mace to argue that "in the days of the patriarchs ... the Israelites were a nomadic people" - an exceedingly simplistic anthropological statement which no credible biblical scholar would make today. Further, "families lived in the same tents . . . looking after the animals and doing the household chores, the latter being exclusively the work of women" - a simplistic view of women in the ancient Near East now being strongly challenged by C. Meyers, N. Steinberg, K. van der Toorn, and others. Other problems could be listed, but the strength of this book is its clear, in- formed way of introducing biblical scholars to the world of contemporary studies of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 579 metaphor. Its weakness is its unfortunate lack of historical, archaeological, anthro- pological, and literary sensitivity to the Bible itself. Its intentions are noble, but the conversation engendered is decidedly one-sided. Michael S. Moore, Fuller Theological Seminary in Arizona, Phoenix, AZ 85017</page></plain_text>
