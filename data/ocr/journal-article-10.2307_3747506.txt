<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS In spite of this, the book brings an impression of an attractive personality, thoroughly knowledgeable in all matters concerning Descartes, and reflecting suggestively on the modem situation in the light of Cartesian principles. L. J. RUSSELL. Peirce and Pragmatism. By W. B. GALLIE. (Penguin Books. Pp. 247. Price 2S. 6d.) This is likely to be the most valuable of the series of Pelicans on philosophy: if only because Peirce stands in so great need of an expositor. His own writings exist only in a form which gives an impression of a "philosopher of threads and patches". Professor Gallie's book entirely removes this impression. He presents us with an exposition of Peirce's thought so clearly articulated that we may easily lose sight of the enormous task of organizing and collating that must have gone into the preparation of this volume. Indeed, so inseparably interwoven are the many strands of Peirce's thinking that Gallie is often hard put to it to maintain, even for purposes of exegesis, such broad divisions of subject-matter as Epistemology, Logic and Metaphysics. To take one example: Peirce's denial of the epistemological doctrine of "knowledge by acquaintance" depends on his semantical doctrine of Thought-Signs, accord- ing to which a sign is intelligible (is a sign) only in virtue of its relation to other signs which might be said to interpret it; which in turn is scarcely to be under- stood except in the light of Peirce's logical doctrine of hypothesis (a special sort of sign), viz., that a hypothesis depends for its meaning on the possibility of development and modification by further related hypotheses. Gallie rightly insists at the very outset that the pragmatist doctrine of Peirce, which is a theory of meaning, has nothing whatever to do with what is traditionally regarded as "Pragmatism", the doctrine of William James, which is a theory of truth and was expressly rejected by Peirce. Perhaps the most striking and illuminating parts of the book are those in which Peirce is shown (without explicit comparison) to have anticipated familiar modem doctrines. An obvious example is, of course, the verification principle itself, which is virtually what Peirce's pragmatist maxim enunciates. An even more interest- ing example is the similarity between Peirce's account of inference and logical appraisal of argument, and Ryle's work on the construction and utilization of theories-not to mention their common hostility to Cartesianism and the myth of immediate self-knowledge. Gallie's admirable exposition errs, if anywhere, only in a certainreluctance to admit that Peirce made any mistakes. Only in the chapter on Metaphysics are his protests, that Peirce goes too far, more than lukewarm. Elsewhere he constantly turns the shafts of criticism with the plea that even from Peirce's most extravagant dicta we have "much to learn". This is just what he says, for example, of Peirce's view that there is an "observational, and even in an extended sense an experimental, element in all deductive processes" (p. 93)- an "element" which turns out (p. I63) as the employment of diagrams in geometry. Again, in the section on Cosmology (Chap. g) Gallie is at pains (and why not?) to defend Peirce against the charge of "shameless anthropomorph- ism": but the only reason he sees for denying Peirce's cosmology the status of a scientific theory is that its "hypotheses" are not subject to the pragmatist criterion of meaning. He fails to point out that Peirce's "evolutionary law" stating a development from complete spontaneity towards complete deter- mination, being (to adopt Popper's terminology) a statement of trend, is not a "law" at all. There is a suggestion of an assimilation, or even identification, on Peirce's part, between the dynamic development of scientific hypotheses 89</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY as an element in the process of Inquiry (which is a real activity of the com- munity of scientists) and the dynamic development of regularities in Nature (which is itself a cosmological hypothesis); a confusion which prompts the question, whether Peirce distinguished clearly enough between laws and law- statements, or whether, in short, his logic of the term "law" does not stand in need of criticism. In a quotation on page 14, line 26, there is a lacuna which must be mentioned, because it reverses the original meaning. The passage "Do things fulfil the same purpose practically? Then let them be distinguished", should read, "Do things fulfil the same function practically? Then let them be signified by the same word. Do they not? Then let them be distinguished." BERNARD MAYO. Alfarabius, Compendium Legum Platonis. Edidit et Latine vertit F. GABRIELI. Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Arabus vol. III. (London: Warburg Institute. 1952. Pp. xiv + 37 + 46. Price 2Is.) Alfarabi's own works on The Ideal City and The Government of the State afford sufficient evidence of the study and respect accorded to Plato's political writings in medieval Islam, at a time when, as Professor Gabrieli remarks, the West possessed no Latin translation of these dialogues and was absorbed rather in the natural philosophy and metaphysics of the Timaeus. Similar evidence for a slightly later date is provided by Averroes' paraphrase of the Republic, the Hebrew version of which is being edited for the Plato Arabus series by Dr. E. Rosenthal. To make the present epitome of the Laws, Alfarabi (who knew no Greek) could have used either of two Arabic translations, one by HIunain ibn Ishaq and the other by his own Christian pupil Yahya ibn 'Adi. (Both are now lost.) More probably, however, he depended on an already extant epitome in Arabic or Syriac. Such epitomes were made even in antiquity. (Note I7, p. xiv of the present edition.) Whatever his source, it apparently contained only the first nine books, unless, as Dr. Walzer thinks, Alfarabi deliberately omitted the last three in order to avoid getting entangled in the metaphysical doctrine which they contain. His work is an honest attempt to reproduce Plato's meaning faithfully, without distorting it, as other Moslem writers were tempted to do, in order to make it fit the spirit of their own age. In some passages he explicitly rejects the easy path of allegorical explanation. Only by selection and omission does he seek to avoid offending the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. It is not, however, surprising that with his utterly different background, and lacking that acquaintance with the history and outlook of Greece in the fourth century B.C. which we take for granted in a modern interpreter of Plato, he often failed in his aim to make Plato's meaning clear. The epitome, like others of its kind, does not make exciting reading. It has no pretensions to style, but consists largely of a string of sentences beginning with one of a few monotonously-repeated formulae: "Then he explained . . ." or "Then he stated ..." Nevertheless the appearance of an edition of it provides another necessary brick in the edifice which must be built before we can hope to achieve the important historical task of assessing the relations between Greek and Arabic philosophy, and our own indebtedness to Islam for its part in the preservation and communication of Greek thought. Only by a continuation of the labours of Professor Gabrieli and others working with him in the same field shall we ever be in a position to give definitive answers to many of the questions involved. 90</page></plain_text>
