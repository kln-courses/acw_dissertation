<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE' NE OF THE founders of this Association used to say: "The need for technical philosophy is small. But all things should be studied philosophically." This not only states clearly, in my opinion, the most frequent use of philosophy but hints at philosophy's best resource for her own continuing fruitful existence. In harmony with this view of philosophy's wider task, I have chosen for my theme the definition of essential traits in one art-poetry; in one period- the last half-century; and in one relation, viz., to the eternal philo- sophical problem of man and his place in the world. Although to fix in definitions the nature of poetry and the arts has always been difficult, the great ones of our tradition have rarely failed to attempt it. Plato by no means failed to try, in spite of his fear of poetry's potency. Certainly Aristotle- Aristotle ancient and Aris- totle medieval - brought a conspicuous kind of order into the field; for Aristotle ancient made of tragic poems a paradigm of necessary sequence, a symbolic revelation of probability; and Aristotle medieval framed cosmology on architecture. Again, in that age when mathe- matical science most throve, Spinoza freed the imagination by noting its uncontending multifariousness and pictorial vividness, even before he wrote his philosophy more geometrico; and Leibniz, co-inventor of the calculus, almost fell into Pythagoras' danger of making the uni- verse too musical. If, lately, some of our strict reasoners have warned their professional brethren to remain drily consequent if they would be honest, the gentle spectator of philosophers' careers has marked in several, who first agitated a philosophy strenuously scientific, a home- coming after a time to beauty and the arts for ampler truth. Have we 1 Presidential address delivered at the meeting of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association at the Hotel Taft, New Haven, Connecticut, December 27, 1946. 469</page><page sequence="2">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW not read in the later Whitehead: "Philosophy is the endeavour to find a conventional phraseology for the vivid suggestiveness of the poet"? And he who now represents us among the scientists argues in his latest discourse for the indispensable aesthetic component in an adequate world view. On the whole philosophers have been not so much unmindful of the importance of poetry as impatient with its detail and suspicious of its nimble wit and far ranging. To be sure, virtual papers of separation have sometimes been drawn up. At such times pure philosophers and poets have made a convenient compact as to the duty of each. Poetry is what it is, according to this understanding, by its clean detachment from fact, and free fancy. Its function is restorative, image-forming, and beguiling, but not instructive. Science and philosophy are, accord- ing to this view, the authorities on verifiable knowledge, and the assumptions and relations involved. Now to such an understanding, the objection is: Only the developing history of the human spirit can show what in their courses poetry and philosophy are and do. The systematic distinction of functions, though necessary, draws lines where none exist in nature. Certainly much poetry moves in faerie and "nothing affirmeth, and therefore never lieth." But no eternal law prohibits to poetry concern with facts and general ideas. At any rate, in the past fifty years, poets have appeared to intend many satirical comments on the surrounding state of affairs. Not only within their shaggy verses have they passed judgment on the society in which they live, but they have used philosophical sanctions for their judgments. Plato's ghost is invoked by one to serve as a chorus to scoff at such of our fellow-citizens as are throughout life "perfectly adjusted"; Soc- rates' ghost, by another, to sustain the hope that we do not know what we think we know when we look around us. Still another threads a lament over the decay of human dignity and passion upon the symbol of Heracleitean fire. More significant than words and names, however, is the tone and intention. In the midst of his poet's Note-Book, Paul Valery suddenly says: "I was wishing to speak of philosophers - and to philosophers" (p. I88). What he had on his mind was to suggest that philosophers might profit in their capacity to express their ideas exactly by submitting themselves to the severe discipline of poetical composition. He implies that they are insufficiently aware of the fine 470</page><page sequence="3">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE relations of language to thought, and of the interaction of the parts of language with each other. This then is a contribution poetry feels itself competent to make to philosophy. But it is not of philosophy's need of poetry that William Butler Yeats talks. In his late prose writings he recurs more than once to the absorption of philosophy by poetry in the period between I920 and I930. In the twenties, he says the poets put into their poems a sense of suffering that was no longer passive, "no longer an obsession of the nerves," but one that "philosophy had made a part of all the mind" (p. xxxvii). And Hopkins, the poet who- born before his time -by common consent has influenced our con- temporary poets most, insists upon engagement with reality, serious- ness, as the proper virtue of right poetry. "A kind of touchstone of the highest or most living art is seriousness," he says, "not gravity, but the being in earnest with your subject . . . reality." Quotations from recent poets containing such words as "reality" and "seriousness" and reporting "the sudden return of philosophy into English literature about I925" do not of course establish in themselves kinship with what philosophers themselves understand by "reality" and "philosophy." A poet's employment of these terms, even if Valery is right in claiming for them superior subtlety, would cause a use both more concrete and symbolic than professional sorters of facts and ideas would often approve. The Heracleitus of the hearthstone and liturgical torch is not the Heracleitus among the cosmologists. But this stricture does not affect the special claim of our argument here. Though recent poets have sometimes used verse for general reflection, on the whole it is by an intensification of their own special habits that poets offer suggestion to philosophy and touch its borders by fruitful contrast or supplementation. We must agree that the moving power of poetry can only seem relevant to strict philosophical reflection if it can somehow be placed by reason in a world where reason orders. But we intend to maintain the paradox, even so, that the new style, whatever the rough- ness of its manner and apparent madness of its moods, is the outer sign of a new inner seriousness and intense engagement with reality. We are to hold that our poetry has been dense and incoherent in recent years partly because its authors have suffered from the world and have in turn bitten into it to an unusual degree, and have made this double interplay fuel and shaper of song. This same double phe- 47I</page><page sequence="4">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW nomenon - acting and being acted on -can appear, we remember, in the far recesses of metaphysical discussion as a candidate for "mark of being." We said just now that the contemporary poet's relevance to the philosopher was largely the result of an intensification of the poet's traditional habits. What are these habits ? The poet's way of behaving Milton called "sensuous and passionate." Poetry, he would say, is more immediate than thought, closer to the impact on eye and ear of color and sound; and that inside the poet the reverberations of these fresh impacts still are preserved and mingle in his song. But along with this "heat" of the poet, Croce has placed the contrary quality: "coldness." Croce means that when the poet works as artist he maintains a certain aloofness from his kind and the world about him, and acknowledges no law but that of his own craft. That there is a deep paradox in the poet's nature many have recent- ly noted. I shall only be putting my own interpretation and mode of expression on a common observation when I draw out what the para- dox seems to me in part to be, and what its use for us. The poet belongs to the class of sensitive beings. Whatever goes on around him, or echoes within, finds him attentive beyond the average. He is finely aware, but he is also strongly aware. His mode of taking impressions suggests to the onlooker something like physical dis- turbance, or at least visible excitation. One recent poet has said of all poets that their particular faculty is to receive vibrations and trans- mit them. "Vibration," "trembling," "throbbing," "pulsing" -these words are noticeably frequent in descriptions of the way the poet is affected by experience. When the stimulus reaches the limit of its importance for him, he is said to be in ecstasy-that is, moved out of position. All these metaphors bear witness to the delicacy with which the poet's nerves are swung and the ease with which they are deflected. But it is no less striking a fact about the class of beings called poets, that they are the origin of impresses received by other things. Indeed, unless a poet has energy enough to plant a shape he wills on what he treats for the time being as mere stuff - mere potentiality of exist- ence - he is no poet. Sometimes we call this side of the poet's nature the artist or craftsman in the poet. But that is quibbling, for the word poet itself means maker. Unless the poet shows himself, from one point of view, as first cause of permanently delectable aesthetic effects from 472</page><page sequence="5">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE measured langauge - even suggesting divinity in his power of making and unmaking waves of air and chance impressions - we classify him as a man of sensibility only. An epigrammatic definition of the imagi- nation stamped out by Gerard Manley Hopkins - "the imagination is the hand within the mind"-is token of the fact that a poet more molds sensation than collects it. In general, we now suggest, the poet is the doer-and-undergoer, par excellence. The doubleness of the poet shines out in his relation to his two chief pieces of equipment: images and rhythm. Are they presents to him, or does he construct them? Both. The musical alternation of rhythm, by his own testimony, is the effectual afterimage, in his pulses and in- terior conversation, of the advance and recession of waves upon the shore, swaying of boughs in the wind, or other rocking thing in nature or his own processes. But to this origin in the end goes less than half the credit. If the swinging of wind and waves or hands and feet is born again as thesis and arsis, caesura and phrase, the imagination's "hand within the mind" gives what so comes its final form. Poets put into a kind of inner laboratory of cadences and balances those little tunes that they find singing themselves within. Their cunning devises tricks of acceleration and retardation and sudden shifts of melody to impress an idea, as thus: And for darkened Man, that complex multiplicity Of air and water, plant and animal, Hard diamond; infinite sun. The whole puzzling paradox of where rhythm comes from is debated by Wallace Stevens in his "Idea of Order at Key West." Of a singer making music by the sea he writes: It may be that in all her phrases stirred The grinding water and the gasping wind. i. e., nature furnishes part of the cause. But the human act, and articu- late language, he immediately adds, are a larger part. But it was she and not the sea we heard. She sang beyond the genius of the sea. The song and water were not medleyed sound Since what she sang was uttered word by word. He puts his finger on the human motivation when he says that the maker, man, has a passion to order, with his language, the words of the sea. On the semantic side, the poet's material is imagery. Here also there is ambiguity, for imagery seems lately to have moved both closer to 473</page><page sequence="6">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW and farther away from reality. On the whole the recent poets' images have deepened into symbols. The tendency to depict the lovable shows of nature by delicate comparisons, while always with us, has yielded in large measure to adumbrations through imagery less sensuous and more reflective of hidden forms. Or rather, imagery's mode has split itself into the full compass of possible contradiction. The symbol is designed to tell some kind of serious truth about the bottom of the soul or the naked twentieth century. Yeats has noted the pervasiveness of the symbol "bone" in recent verse and remarks that the image of the "star" flourished in an earlier time. He attaches meaning to this shift, and certain it is that not for nothing have unhappy figures of deserts and carrion, filth and asses, thickened on the poets' pages. But while images are used thus starkly to convey with force the nature of our ugly environment, the poet is also more than commonly concerned with a symbol's intrinsic, half-drunken multifariousness. He uses fan- tastic forms, as if he were engineering a ballet. Indeed, part of the obscurity of recent poetry comes from its double aim, to wit: both analysis of reality into essential meanings, and also a delighted tum- bling about with the possible multiple suggestions of words as such. Nonsense and a sybil's wisdom seem both to be courted. The poet, says Stevens, in "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" went into the park, sat down on a bench, and passed into the poet's trance. The lake in front of him became his Theatre of trope ... The water of The lake was full of artificial things, Like a page of music, like an upper air, Like a momentary color, in which swans Were seraphs, were saints, were changing essences. In the trance, the poet continues, metaphor became a kind of irrespon- sible vagabond, that made "iris frettings on the blank." Yet a favorite emphasis in Stevens is the danger of anthropomorphic thinking.- Again the same poet who, exulting in aesthetic freedom, wrote, Gather me Into the artifice of eternity . .. I shall never take My bodily form from any natural thing But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make Of hammered gold and gold enameling ... 474</page><page sequence="7">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE also wrote: Parnell came down the road, he said to a cheering man: Ireland shall get her freedom and you shall break stones. A third example: The same poet who seemed to send forth her mes- meric lines, Monotonously fell the rain Like thoughts within an empty brain for whatever suggestion the sound and symbol could evoke, found the same image crystallizing itself to stand for the raids on London in 1940: Still falls the Rain- Dark as the world of man, black as our loss. We have been saying that poetry, born in the vibration of its in- spiration, sustained in wavering rhythms and ambiguous symbols, is always characterized by double or plural pointing, even to the height of its completest communication. Indeed, it often prospers best if its residual meaning strains against nature, making two great faces of things confront each other and strike fire for the imagination through their friction. In other words, important poetic fiction may by its ap- parent intense unreason throw light on those metaphysical first prin- ciples that Whitehead says "mutely appeal for an imaginative leap." Those early metaphysical poets with whom the moderns feel so close a kinship conveyed their meaning by daring conjunctions and vast alternatives, as: lust and religion, Heaven and Hell, woman-angel and woman-Eve, the Universe and the bridal bed.-Donne wrote: She's all States, and all Princes, I Nothing else is. The reflective and disturbed poets of the twentieth century draw their multiple meaning and vast alternatives mostly from what the twentieth century or the recent past presents to them. Even when they veil their meaning in old Greek or Irish myths, the tenor is often con- temporary. Inspecting these poems, we find burdening their course the oppositions of war and peace, dead culture and eternal salvation, socialism and capitalism, tyranny and freedom. But we also find properly metaphysical problems: the relation of time to eternity, the bounded object to space, and--our own problem in this paper- man to his world. "What can man do ?" "How effectual is man's will ?" "How far is man creature and in what sense creator of his world?" 475</page><page sequence="8">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW These questions sound familiar to philosophers. Examination of recent poetry reveals their presence there. Sometimes the problematic situ- ation of man in his world is stated plainly as in W. H. Auden's: We are created from and with the world To suffer with and from it day by day: Whether we meet in a majestic world Of solid measurements or a dream world Of swans and gold . . . Our claim to own our bodies and our world Is our catastrophe. What can we know But panic and catastrophe until we know Our dreadful appetite demands a world Whose order, origin, and purpose will Be fluent satisfaction of our will. Plain putting of the question is frequent in Wallace Stevens. In fact he seems half-consciously to debate the claims of man, the natural reflex of his environment, versus man, source of his experiences and shaper of his history. The first claim is the theme of the half-humorous tiny poem "Theory": I am what is around me Women understand this. One is not a duchess A hundred yards from a carriage. These, then, are portraits: A black vestibule. A high bed sheltered by curtains. In general, Stevens is fond of saying that men are nothing more than "invisible elements of places made visible." The soul, he said, is composed Of the external world. The man in Georgia walking among pines Should be pine-spokesman. But Stevens does, even so, impute a very powerful imaginative faculty to his earthy men: He writes: the mind Turns to its own figurations and declares, This image, this love, I compose myself of these As in the powerful mirror of my wish and will. Poets are not usually at their best when abstract questions appear baldly in their verses. But the way recent poets have expressed through images human suffering, and at the same time reached after some faith 476</page><page sequence="9">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE in and way of conceiving human power, makes, in the interaction of the two, a clear call to the thinker's ordering function. How can the sorter of ideas reconcile Hopkins' man: "soft sift in an hour-glass" with Stevens': "the doer of all that angels can" and "crystallizer of the revolving world"? The problem is admittedly universal and eternal. Older poets have aired it in their manner. But the new poets, intro- spective and rebellious, have often carried both their problem and their technique into the ferment of the soul's "dark night." Their style and thinking have been aptly described by Yeats: "constantly interrupted, broken, twisted into nothing by its direct opposite, . . . [qualified by] nervous obsession, nightmare, stammering confusion . . . loss of self- control . . . unbridged transitions, unexplained ejaculations, that make (the) meaning unintelligible" (xxv, intro. to Anthol.). I have chosen to analyze the suggestions of these difficult poets, as they bear on our main problem, under three symbolic captions: I. Man, the puppet. I draw here from Thomas Hardy. 2. Man, the cutter of agate. The phrase is Yeats's. 3. Man, the leaping laugher. This is the title of a poem by George Barker. These three categories stand for various ways in which man is active and passive in his world. My first source, Thomas Hardy, is relatively simple. In him, man is passive - even worse, a puppet. Thomas Hardy published The Dynasts in I903. In the preface he states that the poem was shaped to give a "modern expression of a modern outlook." What he takes the "modern outlook" to be he de- scribes a little further on. "The meditative world," he says, "is older, more invidious, more nervous, more quizzical, than it once was, and . .unhappily perplexed by - Riddles of Death Thebes never knew" (p. xi). He chooses for the expression of these unhappy perplexities certain "phantom intelligences" that he domiciles in an "Overworld." From this unearthly perspective "The Ancient Spirit of the Years," "The Spirit of the Pities," and the "Spirits Sinister and Ironic" comment through their dramatic choruses on the Napoleonic wars. Hardy is a vivid chronicler. Some of the scenes of the historical pageant, such as that of the death of Nelson on the "Victory" at Trafalgar and of com- 477</page><page sequence="10">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW mon British soldiers dying in dark cellars in Spain, no reader is likely to forget. Yet it is not so much with the desperate human interest of these characters, actions, passions, and events that Hardy is ultimately concerned as with their record on the high balance sheet of the Phan- tom Intelligences. For Hardy as for Aristotle, tragedy, though an imitation of the actions and passions of men, is more serious and philosophical than history. He like Aristotle is interested in the ele- ment of necessity present in human affairs. He ruminates the riddle of predicates of value. The comments from the overworld, as they issue now from the Spirit of the Years who is the spokesman of the clocklike Mechanism at the Back of Things, and now from the Spirits of Pity and Irony, are logically incompatible, as dramatic statements have a right to be. But there is a flash in the collision of Hardy's Mechanism and Hu- manism as if from the broken colors in Impressionist painting. On the one hand, values are made nonexistent. The Universe is an automaton. Unweeting why or whence. It works unconsciously . . . Eternal artistries in Circumstance . . . the pulsion of the Byss Unchecks its clock-like laws. . . . The systems of the suns go sweeping on ... In mathematic roll unceasingly .... Or, as Hardy's metaphors accumulate, the Universe is "a sublime fermenting-vat," "a knitter drowsed," "a viewless, voiceless, Turner of the Wheel." It is obviously nonsense to speak of good or evil in such a context. On the other hand, Pity not only assigns at the outset a value - a negative one - to all terrestrial history, but at times breaks into the earthly scene, e. g., to protest in Napoleon's ear his treachery to the cause of Liberty, or to ask for the merciful coup de grace for wounded soldiers crazed, blaspheming, and in agony. The Spirits Ironical and Sinister, though less Heart and more Intellect than the Spirit of Pity, collide even more effectively with the World Mecha- nism. Pity is indeed made "loving-kind" by Hardy but also young and ineffectual. Pity chants a vague melancholy sentiment at the beginning of the Poem: 478</page><page sequence="11">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE "We would establish those of kindlier build, In fair Compassions skilled, The mild, the fragile, the obscure content.. Those, too, who love the true, the excellent, And make their daily moves a melody." And she voices another vague sweet wish at the end: that the rages Of the ages Shall be cancelled, Consciousness the Will informing, till It fashions all things fair. The Spirits Sinister and Ironical on the other hand are powers with cutting edges. Their remarks shock us because the more the Tale be- comes humanly tragic, the more it feeds their dramatic intelligences with food for laughter. Pity, grieved past bearing, cries that she can- not bear the beacons of war lit on Egdon Heath, but Spirit Sinister says: "This is good, and spells blood. I assume that It means to let us carry out this invasion with pleasing slaughter, so as not to disappoint my hope?" and after a few minutes makes this generalization: "My argument is that War makes rattling good history; but Peace is poor reading. So I back Bonaparte for the reason that he will give pleasure to pos- terity." When the Spirit of Pity says of General Mack before Ulm, "The clouds weep for him," Spirit Sinister answers: If he must he must; And it's good antic at a vacant time. If one now inquires: What place does man occupy in Hardy's uni- verse, one would be tempted to answer first: "A place on a puppet's stage. In other words, no place." Hardy himself uses the metaphor of puppets for his characters and the pulling of wires for their actions. But he also lets his Phantom Intelligences call attention to the in- tolerable contradiction "of making figments feel," that they feel, and puppetry remain Is an owned flaw in [Nature's] consistency. So the second answer is: Man appears in Hardy's world as the suf- ferer. The poet, we said at the beginning, is acutely sensitive to the impressions moving in on him from the natural and human world. Hardy is such a sensitive; he so vibrates; he so makes us vibrate by 479</page><page sequence="12">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW his imaginative vision of the victims of the Napoleonic wars. If now we change our position, taking Hardy with us, from drama to orderly and consistent philosophy, we must say: it cannot be both ways. Suf- fering is not a mechanical event. Either the Universe is different, or man is different from Hardy's picturing. We can say more: Though Hardy's characters suffer and Hardy must have had parallel feelings in construing his scenes, Hardy has been a powerful maker in the process of building his puppet show. A man who can originate such a momentous spectacle is not a passive creature in a fermenting vat. He is what every great poet is, an amazing agent. He was not fitted to picture rebels, nor actuate on his stage the morally responsible soul. But such beings are implications of Hardy's own functioning. With the arrival of our second phase-man, the cutter of agate, the fine craftsman - our subject becomes more complicated. The ar- tist in the poet now swells almost to the point of crowding out the physical and historical man in his human environment. The "place" of the poet's concern is his own workbench. "The chief use of the meaning of a poem," says T. S. Eliot, "is to keep the [reader's] mind diverted and quiet, while the poem does its work upon him; much as the imaginary burglar is always provided with a bit of nice meat for the house-dog" (Use of Poetry, p. I51). Eliot is speaking of only one class of poet. But this class has lately been conspicuous. The business of such a poet, Eliot is here suggesting, is to polish his instrument and discipline his hand, using a recognizable subject only as a concession to our habitual un-fineness. When Eliot uses the expression, "while the poem does its work upon him," he apparently means: "while the poet awakens the reader's pure sensi- tivity." Concentrated incantation is always part of what a poet does and may be all. Listen to Paul Valery: "The thought must be hidden in verse as nutritive virtue is hidden in fruit. Fruit is nourishment, though it seems to be nothing but delight. One perceives only pleasure; and yet one receives a substance - Enchantment - that is the nour- ishment conveyed to one. And sweet is its going down" (Le passage est suave). The implementation of this "suave passage" is then, in the belief of the delicate carvers of verbal agates, the poet's main task. Interest 480</page><page sequence="13">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE in texture, rhythm, pattern, and structure for the moment outweighs interest in objective reference. The new group have adopted a new principle of metrical equivalence which supplants for them the simple old way of measuring feet by counting off equal numbers of syllables, somewhat as the far subtler nuclear physics has made obsolete the old- er theory of atomic substances. According to the principle of metrical equivalence, the cadence and balance of verse depend in part on a fine, felt awareness of the pressures and resistances of nuanced vowels and operated consonants, labials, and sibilants. Here is an example of slow movement, sibilants, thin vowels: "A mouth like old silk soft with use." In: Like gript stick Still I sit there are sibilants and thin vowels, but the vowels are tightly wrapped in difficult consonants, and there is effort in movement. Texture is interwoven with subtly counterpointed rhythm so that the total metri- cal pattern becomes rich and varied, almost to the confounding of old reading habits, as in the following: He comes among The summer throngs of the young Rose, and in his long Hands flowers, fingers, carries; Dreamed of like aviaries In which many phoenixes sing, Promising touch soon In summer, never to come. Rhyme is often in the middle of lines, instead of tapping off conclu- sions, and the delicious near-rhyme pleases these poets more than full echo. On grounds of harmony and proportion-and lack of verifiable meaning - Valery classifies Pascal's famous line "Le Silence eternel de ces espaces infinis M'EFFRAYE" ("The eternal Silence of these infinite spaces frightens me") as a "perfect poem" - not a "thought," as it is classified by its author. Here, says Valery, is rhetorical sym- metry; a formidable metaphor of equilibrium: the noun "silence" balances the noun "spaces"; the adjective "eternal," the second adjec- tive "infinite"; again, this whole massive characterization of the cos- mos is set in contrast to its little human offshoot, in the short verbal sign of his terror: "M'EFFRAYE." 48i</page><page sequence="14">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW The creation of enchantment by formal devices may go so far as the creation of an artificial universe. This is precisely what Valery claims for the quoted "Pensee" of Pascal. "This vast verse," he says, "con- structs the rhetorical image of a system complete in itself, a Universe." (p. 42) Here is that supersensuous body that imagination's rhythms and timbres engender. The carved agate, the beautiful crystal, thus slips into the place vacated by common subject, common meaning, man and his world. The airy affinities of this delicate workmanship are mathematics and music. In such fields grow harmonious fictions whose validity is not measured in terms of common experience. Our poets often use the musical analogy, as in a vivid apprehension . . . In an interior ocean's rocking Of long, capricious fugues and chorals. and: the study of the music Of Ash-Wednesday should compel the minds of all Poets; for in a hundred years no poem Has sung itself so exquisitely well. Poetry's linkage with music reminds us that "elliptical," oblique, unearthly poetry may, like music, have symbolic meaning. And the question arises whether symbols may give a richer content and sug- gestiveness than more familiar representation can. The fact that "sub- ject" is thrown to the common reader like a piece of meat by the burglar to the house dog does not exclude a symbol's "evocation." If one then asks what is the deliverance of "evocation" on the problem of "Man and his Place," the answer proves to be less tenuous than one at first thought. Of course "evoked" meanings are not convertible into factual propositions. They stir up sentiments and actuate moods. The words "eternal" and "infinite," says Valery, as he develops his analysis of Pascal's "perfect little poem," "are symbols of non-thought. Their value is wholly affective. . . . They provoke the particular sensation of the impotence of imagining." But there is more in some recent poetical music than sensation and affective value, or a kernel of vague enchantment. There is a kind of semantic revenge, or public meaning-in-spite-of-intention. The subject that pervades a consider- able body of this delicately carved poetry is the ruin of our present civilization by greed and worldly ambition. Flashing across the dark 482</page><page sequence="15">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE picture are nostalgic memories of the author's own childhood. In their search for the rightly weighted set of sounds and the rhythms counter- pointed and wavering, our enchanters confess that - at least in part - they look deep within themselves as they pass into lyricism. There they find not only little tunes, and an urge for swinging, varied bal- ance, but flickering scenes, memorable because of blissful, irresponsible playdays. In Eliot's "Burnt Norton," for example, after a few solemn lines, without any explicit bridge there comes this: Footfalls echo in the memory Down the passage . . . Towards the door . . . Into the rose-garden. My words echo Thus, in your mind. Then we get a faint reference to birds, rose leaves, a pool, laughter- then: Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children Hidden excitedly, containing laughter. At the end, in symmetry, there is the same dim recalling of childish games in the rose garden. Except for bright reliefs like this, the "subject" runs on the surrounding vulgarity and spiritual death. Man's place for many an agate-cutter is a pessimist's chaos, ugly, selfish, obscene. Its west has declined; its values are decadent. It is a "rat's alley," "stony rubbish," "a heap of broken images." The in- habitants of "The Waste Land" are "hooded hordes swarming" over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth. Individually they are palm- ists, scented with synthetic perfumes, toothless whores, drowned and having their bones picked, lean solicitors reading last testaments. Man and his place is here - dust-to-dust. Eliot reveals his core of feeling in The Waste Land when he says: "I will show you fear in a handful of dust." Edith Sitwell calls man's place a "spider's universe," - "the idiot drum of a universe changed to a circus." The problem that the agate-cutter sets for the consistency-loving philosopher is, in our present context, this: The poet, as refiner of language, finds his tool both instrument of enchantment (the function- ing of language here being at the same time language as intrinsic value) and instrument of satire, fit to scorch our world. He makes a 483</page><page sequence="16">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW world of his own which is music; he uses that music to tell off con- temporary manners. The resultant effect is that simultaneous tension of hating and loving such as Sappho and Catullus ascribe to the dis- tracted lover. In the behavior of these poets as I have interpreted it, there seems to be a maximum of contradictory attitudes: a repudiation of a beastly world and the fine evocation of a world of carved autono- mous beauty. The location of the behavior betrays, I think, the source of the contradiction. Both in doing and undergoing, these poets trans- act, by and large, with surfaces. Fastidious sensibilities as they essen- tially are, they recoil at once from filth and greed as they see it in its outward shows, and they make, for their consolation, exquisite tex- tures, which are also word surfaces that they tend to caress with the sensitive surface of their imagination's hand. Both the doing and the undergoing are nervously energetic but plastically inhibited, because of the immediacy of the reaction; one might without too much exag- geration say that the poet remains suspended, vibrating, between what comes into him and what goes out from him. Is a philosopher prepared to say that if the poet's theme is the world around him, and without him, he takes it inadequately when his references are typically "pejora- tive"? Does such a poet perhaps not know incisively and thoroughly the good side of essential humanity? If he both felt and worked with a larger part of himself and deeper layers of his place, would both the tone and the reference of his poetry change? Although the contradiction of the Hardyesque mood is gone (man made a puppet by a man who is anything but a puppet), still a degree of the passivity of Hardy's attitude survives. The poet of our second type is still too impressionable for one whose calling is "making." Yeats wrote "The Cutting of an Agate" between I903 and I915. He then declared that he hoped to have got far enough away from life to "make credible strange events and elaborate words." He came back to life about I925 along with many other poets who, as he tells us, awoke in that day to a sense of their responsibility. On Christmas day, I936, he wrote: "I am an old man now and month by month my capacity and energy must slip away, so what is the use of saying that both in England and Ireland I want to stiffen the backbone of the high-hearted and high-minded and the sweet- hearted and sweet-minded, so that they may no longer shrink and hedge, when 484</page><page sequence="17">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE they face rag-merchants like X. Indeed before all I want to strengthen myself. It is not our business to reply to this and that, but to set up our love and indignation against their pity and hate." Here the poet assumes a moral duty: to stiffen the backbone of the spiritually distinguished by the diffusion of joy based on a vision of truth. But what the poet's work is, once he has become a brother of the common life, may easily be confused by him and by others. He is to diffuse joy, but as only he can, and with a new emotional accent. The poet's place in the world is still the place of the poet, even if the poet claims participation in what concerns us all. He is still the ex plorer and master of language, the speaker of "imagination's Latin," even if his language aims at wider relevance. In "Esthetique du mal," Wallace Stevens, conning over man's ills, asserts in a setoff distich that our savior, in this plight, is the music of language: Natives of poverty, children of malheur The gaiety of language is our seigneur. Indeed it is by remaining poet that the poet best fights for his coun- try. Stevens says: The soldier is poor without the poet's lines, His petty syllabi, the sounds that stick Inevitably modulating, in the blood. And war for war, each has its gallant kind. How simply the fictive hero becomes the real; How gladly with proper words the soldier dies, If he must, or lives on the bread of faithful speech. I mentioned earlier that the modern poet has offered his practical services to the philosopher for instruction in the sharpening of speech. Workers with words have a good housekeeper's revulsion against messiness in verbal indication. A recent poet has said that public life would benefit if our legislators could achieve something like verbal- surgical cleanliness through the emulation of poetic practice. The sug- gestion that language is bread for the soldier and surgical instrument for the statesman has the advantage of implying that words are more than signs and symbols. It emphasizes their common use and makes them a kind of thing in the world of things. But teaching philosophers and lawmakers how to read and write is still an avocation of the poet, rather than his vocation. "Illumination of plain and common things," one poet suggests, is the work of the poet, false romanticism having now been dismissed. So 485</page><page sequence="18">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW he sings about "Ploughing on Sunday," and "Lilacs in Carolina," "Two Pears," and "A Glass of Water." Another poet asks poets in the same vein: "Are we, perhaps, here just for saying: House, Bridge, Fountain, Gate, Jug, Olive tree, Window, - possibly: Pillar, Tower? . . . but for saying, remember, oh, for such saying. ..." As Americans I think we may congratulate ourselves on the success of our poets in this kind. We celebrate with felicity the homely things in our landscape: stone walls, birch trees, and subways. It proves that the salt of lightness seasons our poetical feasts, and that we know the high value of democratic conviviality - living with things around us on gay terms. If Democritus' Ghost would protect me, I would even suggest that a more literal kind of conviviality is a holiday invocation of the poet: Noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine. Yeats listed "humorous self-forgetful drunkenness" and mischievous- ness, along with physical beauty and courage, among "beautiful lofty things." My father upon the Abbey stage, before him a raging crowd. "This Land of Saints," and then as the applause died out, "Of Plaster Saints," his beautiful mischievous head thrown back. Standish O'Grady supporting himself between the tables Speaking to a drunken audience high nonsensical words; Augusta Gregory seated at her great ormulu table Her eightieth winter approaching: yesterday he threatened my life, I told him that nightly from six to seven I sat at this table, The blinds drawn up. This transition from nonsense to courage brings us back to Yeats's pronouncement: that the work of the poet as distinctive agent in the common world is to stiffen the backbone of the spiritually minded by the diffusion of joy based on a vision of truth. The mood required is that of a curious double-edged laughter, laughter that attacks as well as rejoices. You remember Kant's definition of laughter: expectation suddenly brought to nothing, the traumatic collapse of psychic habit setting up a spasmodic vibration of the diaphragm. If we may be pardoned violence to Kant's formula we may say: Poetic generation as leaping 486</page><page sequence="19">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE laughter is here and now ordinary expectation suddenly brought to something, to dangerous lyrical potency, the collision setting up a trembling of the whole man. For a poet's laughter, on this view, "completes the partial mind" and marks an access of energy that spreads over the entire organism. Poesis often signalizes a moment of excited discovery. There is a sudden discontinuity when the poet strikes in and makes his fertile encounter. With Louis McNeice, he exclaims, "The world is suddener than we think it." His insights, Wallace Stevens says, are moments of awakening Extreme, fortuitous, personal, in which We more than awaken, sit on the edge of sleep, As on an elevation. This laughing poetry crowns discovery with "sudden glory" and acts both as release and recharge. The poet is all at once aware that he can triumph over the toughest, hardest material: his own inertia, if he is old, . . .My temptation is quiet, Here at life's end . . . Grant me an old man's frenzy. An old man's eagle mind; -his own ambition, if he fancies himself important, Ambition is my death. That flat thin flame I feed, that plants my shadow; his fear of his own body, if he has never felt at home in it; the rough, cruel world, if he recognizes his tendency toward oversensitivity, Many men mean Well: but tall walls Impede, their hands bleed and They fall, their seeds the Seed of the fallen . . . Whom the noonday washes Whole, whom the heavens compel And to whom pass immaculate messages . . . Impede impediments Leap mountains, laugh at walls. But the double edge of the laughter implies contrary moods as well as collision of a poet with his weakness and his world. Irony and bitter- ness, sometimes vulgar, defiant riotousness, pull against complaisance and gaiety. Yeats, in a memorable passage, claims for today's poetic laughter a component of savage triumph that recalls Hobbes's concep- 487</page><page sequence="20">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW tion. He quotes the saying of Swift, "When I am told that somebody is my brother protestant, I remember that the rat is a fellow creature," and comments: "That seems to me a joyous saying." Now we delight in this example; but when Yeats introduces a more sinister element in a quotation from a Dutch mystic we are startled. The mystic said: "I must rejoyce, I must rejoyce without ceasing, though the whole world shudder at my joy." What kind of joy is it, I ask, that causes universal shuddering? A joy, I answer, whose energy has passed beyond the control of reason. And yet, if reason is the function in man, which we believe directed toward objective report and actual fact, it is reason which is immediately associated by Yeats with the Dutch mystic's joy: These emotions, he says, do not desire to change their object. They are "a form of eternal contemplation of what is." I think the philosopher may question whether the rejoicing poetry of today, in becoming active, acknowledges any more the contempla- tive virtues. Practical in a sense the new poets are; engaged actively with the world they would be; and also aware of world-wide, deep-set human problems, but too engrossed in their rich ambiguous rejoicing for the difficult "contemplation of what is." They sometimes confuse, I think, predilection for the palpable, and a "large, loud liberty" with truth-telling, and dismissal of traditional belief with sense of fact. Ashamed of an earlier fastidiousness, they have adopted a complemen- tary one and so remain in their own way unobjective. Two examples must suffice: the grosser aspects of life are not only given their pro- portionate place but the protruding foreground-a baroque thrust- and the moral attitude of compassion tends to be frowned on as weak. Yeats's prayer secured for him I think, his "old man's eagle mind." All must acknowledge the lusty power of his late verse. Out of what does song grow? he asks, and answers: "Five things: the virgin, the harlot, the lion, the eagle, and the wild." Here the statement is power- ful, but balanced. But he is too harsh when he writes that his inspira- tion is A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street, Old kettles, old bottles, and a broken can, Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder's gone, I must lie down where all the ladders start, In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart. 488</page><page sequence="21">RECENT POETS ON MAN AND HIS PLACE Again, it is neither the virgin nor the harlot that Wa!lace Stevens' poet yearns for, but the most grossly maternal, the creature Who most fecundly assuaged him, and not the mauve Maman. His anima liked its animal And liked it unsubjugated. "Mauve maman" is here perverse, I think. Again: granted that Auden is right in his commentary on "The Tempest" in redeeming the unfairly treated Caliban and setting him beside delicate Ariel, even so, on the whole, one hears too much of "earth's frankly brutal drum." You will recall that Thomas Hardy, our first great poetical exam- ple, represented the spirit of pity as young and ineffectual; but yet he knew it deserved a place among the heavenly intelligences. What the new poets intend to do with pity is well expressed by Auden, when he says: ". .. .it is precisely in its negative image of Judgment that we can positively envisage Mercy." Mercy - compassion - pity - this class of emotional attitudes seems, to these writers as it did to Spinoza, a lack of perfection, a failure in active virtue. The detached attitude of judging facts and values, or the ebullient one of rejoicing and so triumphing, is substituted. In Spender's phrase, "pity is the same as cruelty," because it turns life into water. He laughs at it with bitter satire: To the hanging despair of eyes in the street, offer Your making hands and your guts on skewers of pity. Christian pity is one of the mistakes of our traditional anthropomor- phic religion, says Stevens: The fault lies with an over-human god, Who by sympathy has made himself a man And is not to be distinguished when we cry Because we suffer [from] our oldest parent. , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If only he would not pity us so much, Weaken our fate, relieve us of woe both great And small, a constant fellow of destiny, A too, too human god, self-pity's kin And uncourageous genesis. ... It seems As if the health of the world might be enough. However dangerous a drug pity is, is it not unrealistic to envision men as everywhere healthy enough to dispense with it? If a too human 489</page><page sequence="22">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW God pitied us too much, does not the middle, limited location of hu- manity itself require its presence for the maintenance of a tolerable lot? Hardy made pity a celestial power. Hopkins, though he could reject even in his agony "carrion comfort," was not able in the end to live without a desperate dose of pity for his own suffering: My own heart let me have more pity on; let Me live to my sad self hereafter kind, Charitable; not live this tormented mind With this tormented mind tormenting yet . . . Come, poor Jack self, I do advise You, jaded, let be; call off thoughts awhile Elsewhere; leave comfort root-room . . Perhaps one of the tasks of the moral philosopher is the re-evaluation and redefinition of compassion, in order that from him it may pass better understood into humane literature. Perhaps the poets have suf- fered so much that they have become not only active but hard. At any rate, if the present spirit of Caliban, romping riotously in poetry, excludes pity, then the element of earth is more hostile to humanity than the element of air, for Shakespeare made Ariel teach the revenge- ful Prospero to supplant revenge with humanity; Prospero said re- flectively to Ariel: Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs, I am struck to the quick, Yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury Do I take part. Here a poet praises the philosopher's instrument, reason, in that it restores a neglected value, compassion. Recent poets, however inco- herent and ironical, have opened new experience to us through lin- guistic invention and have quickened and intensified the philosophical problem of doing and undergoing. Could we remind them, in return, of a fading quality in our common life, a slighted human excellence? KATHARINE GILBERT Duke University 490</page></plain_text>
