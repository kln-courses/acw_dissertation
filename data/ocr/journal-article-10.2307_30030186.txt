<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOVING PARTS AND SPEAKING PARTS: SITUATING VICTORIAN ANTITHEATRICALITY BY REBECCA F. STERN In her influential conduct manual, The Daughters of England, Sarah Stickney Ellis presents a portrait of a woman who has succumbed to "a selfish desire to stand apart from the many; to be something of, and by herself."' Invoking the images and discourse of industrial labor debates, Ellis compares the spectacle of this woman's failed attempt to manufac- ture a "cheerful ... witty... animated, brilliant, and amusing" self to the spectacle of men forced to perform repetitive, unnatural actions that are neither original to themselves, nor conducive to the development of human character. Because, Ellis argues, such a woman's achievements demand from her ingenuity in the way of evading, stooping, conciliating, and some- times deceiving; as well as . . . a continued series of efforts to be cheerful when depressed, witty when absolutely dull, and animated, brilliant, and amusing, when disappointed, weary, or distressed, ... [w]e are led to exclaim, that the miner, the convict, and the slave have an easier and a happier lot than hers. (D, 133; emphasis added) In this essay, I will be arguing that, in her project of shaming the would-be exceptional woman's attempt to construct herself, Ellis's turn to the lexicon of industrialism is in no way random.2 Rather, this smooth transition from dissimulation to mechanization is typical of the rhetoric of proper nineteenth-century subjectivity. Ellis's horror at this woman's behavior lies largely in the transparency of its artifice, so that the sacrifice of "nature" to class interests is condemnable not so much because it is unusual, but because it is detectable. Her repetitions of the gestures and signs of cheerfulness, wit, and so on, become scandalous because they strip those qualities of their essentialist claims and reduce them to manufactured products. In the interests of clarity, let me offer an anachronistic example. In producing this essay, I found myself consistently haunted by a scene from Brian Forbes's 1975 film, The Stepford Wives. In it, the heroine, Joanna, enters the home of her friend, Bobbi, only to find that, like the ELH 65 (1998) 423-449 Â© 1998 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 423</page><page sequence="2">other women of Stepford, Bobbi has fallen victim to a sinister genius. The genius, retired from a career of making robots for Disney, now plies his trade in Stepford, producing different figurines for a different small world. His domestic models are suburban angels in the house who slowly but surely kill and replace the human housewives of this sleepy California town. Horrified to find the previously feminist Bobbi dressed in something not far short of a French maid's outfit, Joanna stabs Bobbi in the stomach. Instead of gushing blood, however, Bobbi simply gushes. "How could you do a thing like that?," she asks Joanna, "when I was just going to give you coffee? .. . when I was just going to give you coffee? ... when I was just going to give you coffee?"3 In lieu of bodily fluids, Bobbi produces a series of repetitions, turning to the kitchen cabinet again and again, withdrawing teacups and dropping them to the floor as she continues to deplore Joanna's rejection of her hospitality. Given the mechanical quality of Bobbi's repetitious politeness, I imagine I am not alone in finding it comforting that Bobbi ultimately proves to be an automaton. More disconcerting is the proximity of Bobbi's behavior to what one might deem a "natural" display of social grace, so that the repetitions she makes visible as repetitions carry an ontological threat. Just as the scandal of her incessant lament for the coffee she will never serve lies in its repetitive, mechanical attitude, the scandal of the potential for the repetitions that constitute "natural" behavior to become visible lies in the precarious status of naturalness itself. The disdain with which Joanna receives Bobbi's nearly parodic display of sociability does not, in fact, differ greatly from Ellis's representation of the "evading, stooping, conciliating, and sometimes deceiving" woman; in fact, that Ellis refers to this woman's "efforts to be cheerful when depressed, witty when absolutely dull, and animated, brilliant, and amusing, when disappointed, weary, or distressed" as a "continued series" suggests the ways in which the motions of cheer, wit, and so on have become perceivable as part of a usually invisible string of postures. The definition of performance that seems most apropos to this context, and which I will be employing throughout this essay, both borrows and departs from the work of Judith Butler. In Gender Trouble, Butler argues that gender is not a natural quantity that simply inhabits biologically sexed bodies, but rather "is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts."4 According to Butler, visible repetition has the potential to denaturalize nature for, in order for gender or any other quality to appear "natural," the repetitions that consolidate it must remain invis- ible. Normalcy depends upon this invisibility, upon the transparency of 424 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="3">its constitutive repetitions, in order to maintain its status as truth. Thus, as Butler writes in a later work, Bodies That Matter, performativity as she defines it cannot be either identified with or reduced to "a singular 'act,' for it is always a repetition of a norm or a set of norms, and to the extent that it acquires an act-like status in the present, it conceals or dissimulates the conventions of which it is a repetition."5 In other words, the acts that make up normalcy cannot be singular; they must disappear into a landscape that masks repetition and preserves ideology. If rehearsal is visible behind an act, then the act, detectable as an act, loses its status as real or natural. As Joseph Litvak writes, although such theatrical effects are not capable of "discovering a layer of signification that some how lies 'beyond' ideology," detectable acts and reactions to them "can locate fault lines or pressure points within ideology."6 Performance theory has attained great currency of late, in part due to the potential Butler suggests in taking theatricality as a metaphor to explore the ways in which "acting" pervades "real" life.' While maintain- ing this paradigm, I will be reading beyond the exclusive focus on gender and sexuality that characterizes Butler's original work and that of many theorists who subsequently have employed her theoretical model. Additionally, I will be situating my readings within a specific historical context. This essay is thus a part of a recent trend in performance theory which answer, inadvertently or no, those many critics of a Butlerian approach who attack the amorphousness of using theater as an abstract term and the resulting dangers of making broad cultural claims without solid historical evidence.8 Until recently, few critics have combined the promise of reading performance outside the theater with an historical approach and few have used the Butlerian definition of performance to read social trends, to analyze particular ideological movements at specific historical moments. In this essay, I will be using Butler's links between repetition, performance, and ideology to unravel some of the ideological invest- ments of Victorian England. Repetition in particular connects rehearsal with machinery, the actor with the automaton. The Stepfordian automa- tons at the threshold, in this context, prove to be not so far out of place as they might initially have seemed. In the figure of the automaton, antitheatrical and anti-mechanical sentiments converge; I will be argu- ing that the one cannot be fully understood without the other. As the advent of industrialization worked its effects upon the ideological investments of English culture, the inhabitants of that culture grew increasingly sensitive to visible repetition; by the time Victoria took the throne, British citizens had come to deem "unnatural" anything human Rebecca E Stern 425</page><page sequence="4">that partook of mimicry or seemed in any way mechanical or con- structed. If one's "act" was too visibly rehearsed, the repetitions that made up proper, coherent identity were too reminiscent of the ma- chines that had come to threaten nature in a more literal sense. The Victorians' investments in characterological naturalness, then, can be understood as a direct reaction to concerns about mechanized behavior. That many Victorians worried about the effects of industrialization will be a familiar claim to many literary critics and historians. More than twenty years ago, for example, Richard Altick noted that "In Victorian times, the quality of life among the masses of people first became a pressing social concern. The revolutionary conditions brought about by industrialization and related developments posed the ques- tion, How can society re-fashion and equip itself so as to provide its members with the greatest inner satisfaction and fulfillment?"9 Altick's study, however, like most previous work in this arena, locates both crisis and change at the level of "society"; few critics have focused on the particular set of issues and paradoxes that accompanied the concept of "re-fashioning" at the individual level. The latter subject seems to me a crucial site of investigation. Amongst the most important of Michel Foucault's contributions to cultural studies are his arguments that power has not a hegemonic but a "capillary form of existence"; rather than envisioning large social structures exerting influence over passive individuals, Foucault's work offers a model of "a synaptic regime of power, a regime of its exercise within the social body, rather thanfrom above it."10 If we think of "society" and "politics" as structures that derive their power from individuals, the re-fashioning of which Altick writes must be reconsidered from the perspective of individual and "private" subjects. Re-fashioning provoked different and more acute anxieties when applied to individuals for, while Victorian pundits may have accepted societal fluidity as at worst a necessary evil, the notion of individual fluidity (fashion-ability) was cause for some alarm. My work in this essay explores both why this paradox existed and how it shaped the ways Victorian subjects envisioned themselves, their fellow sub- jects, and their culture. The performance studies approach to history I call upon here seeks not only to demonstrate that particular subjectivities were actively constituted but also to explore how they were. Which debates and cultural investments produced the narrative of the antitheatrical sub- ject? What interests were at stake? How did Victorian writers contend with this fantasy? How did they support or challenge it? I will be 426 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="5">upholding, then, the long-standing concept of Victorian industrial angst, but will be exploring its ramifications for a subtler and more subjective landscape. When Litvak suggests, above, that regarding history with an eye to theatricality "can locate fault lines or pressure points within ideology," he stresses the importance of re-examining well-known material. Rather than dismissing Victorian industrial anxiety as familiar turf, we would do well to return to it from a perspective that takes very little for granted. I begin this essay by exploring the aversions to human repetition expressed in labor reform rhetoric with a particular focus on the Luddites and their impact upon later movements. Whereas the Luddites fought against a machinery that replicated human labor, many later labor reformers argued that men were becoming too much like the machines that were replacing them, and so were losing access to unique, "natural," human behavior. Because machine-breaking entered into wider social debates and so sustained currency as a metaphor even in arenas that had little to do with labor, I turn then to the works of political and domestic writers to explore prejudices against rehearsed, or manufactured, identity within a more popular forum. I put these thinkers into dialogue with each other to reveal their shared suspicions of self-conscious performativity and the ensuing paradoxes of their insistence upon the possibilities of self-transformation through repeti- tion. In both "public" and "private" literature, I find a remarkably consistent hostility towards what John Stuart Mill terms the "'made' or manufactured man."'' It is in this form, as manufactured being, that the figure of the automaton appears, and reappears, in the Victorian consciousness. This too perfectly regulated, too visibly constructed being haunts a wide spectrum of Victorian literature. As Mark Seltzer argues in his study of nineteenth-century American machine culture, the industrial era is one which struggles with the "'discovery' that bodies and persons are things that can be made, and its implications."12 The crisis that seems to arise over and again for public and domestic writers, for novelists and essayists, involves maintaining the tenuous naturalness of human subjectivity, condemning artifice, and preserving the untaintedness of sincere identity. Mill seems to grasp the essence of this impulse as he writes, "unnatural generally means only uncustomary, and . . . everything which is usual appears natural. "13 Ultimately, however, performance theorist Herbert Blau's statement seems most relevant to the dynamics of Victorian self-representation: "credibility occurs as a politics of form."14 Rebecca F. Stern 427</page><page sequence="6">MEN AND/AS MACHINES: THE RHETORIC OF LABOR REFORM In the nineteenth century, the aversion to mechanized subjectivity initially and most literally manifested itself in anxieties about machinery in general, more specifically in anxieties about machinery that replaced or displaced human labor. The Luddites, otherwise known as "machine- breakers," were responsible for the factory attacks of 1811-16 in Nottinghamshire, the Midlands, and Yorkshire. These groups of labor- ers took as their targets both their employers and their employers' means of displacing them, namely the cotton jenny, the stocking-frame, the steam loom, and the power loom. The Luddites' endeavors to fight the tidal wave of industry through machine-breaking was ultimately, of course, unsuccessful; Luddism in its formal trappings was displaced eventually by Chartism which more practically, though no more success- fully, represented the workers' concerns. Although the Luddites did have their sympathizers, machine-break- ing, per se, was not well received by the general public. As George Beaumont wrote in 1812, "The remedy for [the workers'] grievances lies not in the destruction of Machinery. They are oppressed exceedingly, but not by Machinery. Those who accuse Machinery of causing any part of the distresses of the poor, have very contracted views and narrow minds, and see but a little way."'5 Historians such as Malcom Thomis have agreed with Beaumont's dismissal of the specificity of the Luddites' targets, claiming that "These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conve- niently exposed target against which an attack could be made."'16 Such readings, however, miss the symptomatic anxieties expressed in these attacks. Thomis fails to appreciate that, while men may have been making or implementing the mechanical fruits of industrialization, the workers were being displaced by the machines themselves and, at least in part, recognized the machines as adversaries. Rather like the young women of Stepford who found themselves confronted with and sup- planted by deadly mechanical doubles, the workers of Manchester, Yorkshire, and Nottingham, were made redundant by a new technology. Although Luddism as such was history by the early nineteenth century (the movement dying out with the capture, and in some cases the execution, of the main leaders in the second half of 1816), actual machine-breaking continued." Hostility towards machinery developed more powerful and pervasive currency, however, in the rhetoric of political debates surrounding, first, labor reform, and second, the social impact of industrial capitalism. The outrage regarding what certain men 428 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="7">had done to certain machines, that is to say, waned in the face of social concerns about what machinery was doing to men. Authors in these debates relied heavily upon two discursive methods: the anthropomorphism of machines and the dehumanization of work- ers. The former approach enabled Henry Morley to capture and convey the anxieties of industrial society both chillingly and surprisingly accu- rately. Morley's portraits of sinister machines and workers made victim to a nonspecific, impersonal force are characteristic of this genre of labor reform discourse.'8 The following excerpt from his "Ground in the Mill" is one of the most famous examples of this technique: Perhaps it is not good when a factory girl, who has not the whole spirit of play spun out of her for want of meadows, gambols upon bags of wool, a little too near the exposed machinery that is to work it up, and is immediately seized and punished by the merciless machine that digs its shaft into her pinafore and hoists her up, tears out her left arm at the shoulder joint, breaks her right arm, and beats her on the head. ... Possibly it was better for the boy whom his stern master, the machine, caught as he stood on a stool wickedly looking out of window at the sunlight and the flying clouds. These were no business of his, and he was fully punished when the machine he served caught him by one arm and whirled him round and round till he was thrown down dead. . . . 'Watch me do a trick!' cried such a youth to his fellow, and put his arm familiarly within the arm of the great iron-hearted chief. 'I'll show you a trick', gnashed the pitiless monster. A coil of strap fastened his arm to the shaft, and round he went. His leg was cut off, and fell into the room, his arm was broken in three or four places, his ankle was broken, his head was battered; he was not released alive.'" This rhetorical approach, to which Household Words editor Charles Dickens was also partial, was sufficiently popular to provoke angry responses from mill owners and such laissez-faire advocates as Harriet Martineau. Martineau's attacks on Dickens focus specifically on this hyperbolic style which removes responsibility and agency from indi- vidual workers and sacrifices accuracy to dramatic effect. Morley, Dickens, and others like them, Martineau argued, falsely victimized workers injured in factory accidents. Such was the case of "the overlooker at Bury, George Hoyle, aged 50, of whom his comrades said at the inquest, 'It was entirely his own fault; the shaft was quite out of the way of everybody, and unless a person willfully did something he ought not to do, he could not be injured by that shaft.'"20 While the mill owners had their defenders, however, the machines did not. Very few laissez- faire accounts argued on behalf of the machines' good intentions, or on the inappropriateness of personifying them.2' Rebecca E Stern 429</page><page sequence="8">The concern that machinery was becoming human was not, of course, so much literal as strategic. More troubling was the worry epitomized by the famous description of Coketown in Dickens's Hard Times that closes with a portrait of the several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next. (H, 22) As Stephen Spector notes, "Only at the end of the passage are human beings mentioned, and properly so, since they are subsumed by the savage, unnatural city as interchangeable parts in a machine they have created but which seems to run without them. Each person has been reduced to a small repetitive 'behavior."'22 Dickens worried in good company, as political writers increasingly portrayed English workers as mechanized beings. Sally Shuttleworth notes that "Both Tory and radical opponents of contemporary develop- ments in industrialism appropriated the notion of man as machine to voice their criticisms."23 As James Kay-Shuttleworth wrote of the Manchester working classes, "They are drudges who watch the move- ments, and assist the operations, of a mighty material force, which toils with an energy ever unconscious of fatigue. The persevering labour of the operative must rival the mathematical precision, the incessant motion, and the exhaustless power of the machine.""24 The bleakness of such portraits as Kay-Shuttleworth's and Dickens's convey a sense of contagious monotony. As in Morley's representation, workers are in danger of suffering, but here the threat has less to do with factory accidents than with the mechanical quality of repetitive labor. The requirements of factory work produced an existence of such dullness that the workers began to resemble the machinery they served. As Karl Marx saw it, the mechanical system of production was, in effect, "an automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages." The factories of England, in addition to producing other, more ex- changeable commodities, effected "the transformation of the means of labour into machinery.'"25 Anti-reform writers also used the comparison of workers to machines to bolster their pro-machinery arguments, so that the patent on this metaphor did not belong solely to those who opposed industrial development. Andrew Ure, for example, contended that "hand-working 430 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="9">is more or less discontinuous from the caprice of the operative, and never gives an average weekly or annual product at all comparable to that of a like machine equally driven by power."26 Similarly, Peter Gaskell reminded his readers that "each steam-loom is nearly four times as effective as the hand-loom, and that improvements are hourly taking place in its applicability-giving it endowments-approximating it with the most delicate operations of the human hand." Should men wish to better themselves and their situations with respect to the new machin- ery, Gaskell advises that they "compete with it on more equal ground ... by working steadily, orderly, and systematically," that is, by becoming more like machines themselves.27 Both pro-machinery and pro-reform writers, both Ure and Gaskell, found fault with the workers for failing to be as efficient as the machines that increasingly replaced them. The decay of personal agency and the resulting multitude of deper- sonalized workers proved to be increasingly significant themes to social debates of the nineteenth century. Marx's argument, above, suggested that a worker's personal agency was not only compromised but poten- tially eradicated by mechanical activity. Robert Owen's idea of human character as the end-product of a social machine worked from the other end of the assembly line, enabling him simultaneously to critique the industrial system and to consider how men might be better made. His determinist concept of "made men," however, brought on a barrage of criticism. While many political writers came to agree with Owen's ideas about the perils of capitalism-that it encouraged the production of "strong powers of deception . . . destructive of that open, honest sincerity, without which man cannot make others happy, nor enjoy happiness himself"-his concept of human nature as so thoroughly determined, or "made," proved repellent to most of his contemporar- ies.28 The prefabricated human being, the vision of men and women whose actions were always already scripted, was unacceptable to most citizens of industrial culture. It was impossible to maintain clearly the distinction between human beings and the machines that were replac- ing them, if human beings were simply reduced to less efficient, more vulnerable machines. And this distinction was crucial, not only rhetori- cally but ideologically. As Catherine Gallagher notes, "the religious and emotional sources of reform were at variance with the language of social and economic determinism."29 Human beings simply could not be machines if human culture and philanthropy were to continue to prosper. Consequently, the rhetoric of this period is complexly paradoxi- cal and self-contradictory. As Sally Shuttleworth notes, "man was figured both as a rational, self-interested actor, in full control of his own Rebecca F. Stern 431</page><page sequence="10">destiny, and also as a mere cog within the larger machinery of industrial labor, without free agency or self-determination. "30 MECHANICAL IDENTITIES: THE PROBLEM OF REPETITION The problem of mechanized persons one encounters in labor-reform rhetoric plagues many other Victorian reformist discourses as well. With the continuing proliferation of industry, as the socioeconomic strata of Victorian England shifted and changed, concern about the effects of industrialization on human character became a popular topic for both public and domestic writers. It found voice in the writings of Carlyle, Ruskin, and Mill which expressed marked apprehension about mecha- nized behavior, imitation, self-consciousness, and duplicitousness. It also found voice in the works of such writers as Ellis, Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, Mrs. John Sandford and others of that group of moralists who, with the rise of industrial capitalism, came forward to shepherd and tend carefully the subjects changed by its advent. Not unlike more public political writers, this latter group of authors sought to shape the parameters of post-industrial identity by producing meticulous scripts for acceptable social behavior while, at the same time, urging their disciples to be, above all else, "genuine."3' Both public and private social critics did their best to defend against a generation of mechanized subjects, against a population made dull and predictable by either their comfort or their want. As political writers worried about the nature of industrial identity, writers such as Craik, Ellis, and Sandford placed a similarly marked (although for them more conspicuously paradoxical) emphasis on "naturalness" in their manuals of self-assembly known as conduct books. Like their more overtly political counterparts, they warned their readers against the taint of perceptible imitation, of repetition, of any qualities that belied the natural. For example, at the same time as Mrs. Sandford concedes that "Taste is imitative; it follows the lead of others. . . . There is but little original taste," she argues that, "the first great fundamental rule of good taste is, to be natural; and it is from an infringement of this that many of our worst mistakes proceed."32 What these writers, from Carlyle to Sandford, ultimately demanded in their definitions of "natural," non- mechanical, human character was a concealment of the rehearsals, the practice, and the training that constituted that character. What they demanded, in short, was a renunciation of performance. The opening of Thomas Carlyle's essay, "Signs of the Times" (1829), seems to be a simple continuation of a labor-reform rhetoric that condemned the displacement of men by machines: 432 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="11">Were we required to characterise this age of ours by any single epithet, we should be tempted to call it, not an Heroical, Devotional, Philosophical, or Moral Age, but above all others, the Mechanical Age. ... Nothing is now done directly, or by hand; all is by rule and calculated contrivance. For the simplest operation, some helps and accompaniments, some cunning abbreviating process is in readiness... On every hand, the living artisan is driven from his workshop, to make room for a speedier, inanimate one. The shuttle drops from the fingers of the weaver, and falls into iron fingers that ply it faster.33 Later in the essay, however, when Carlyle worries that "men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand," it becomes clear that his concern is not so simple. The automatism of actions proves to work its effects elsewhere. "[People] have lost faith in individual endeavour, and in natural force, of any kind. Not for internal perfection, but for external combinations and arrangements, for institutions, constitutions,-for Mecha- nism of one sort or other, do they hope and struggle. Their whole efforts, attachments, opinions, turn on mechanism, and are of a mechanical character." What seems to trouble Carlyle the most is the fact this "mechanical character" does not restrict itself to external actions. The automatism he discovers in his contemporaries' focus on exterior fault- lessness does not denote human beings emptied of interiority, but rather an interiority that, too, has become mechanized or staged. "Not the external and physical alone is now managed by machinery, but the internal and spiritual also. Here too nothing follows its spontaneous course, nothing is left to be accomplished by old natural methods. Everything has its cunningly devised implements, its preistablished apparatus; it is not done by hand, but by machinery" (S, 142-44). Two aspects of this last passage seem particularly significant to both anti-mechanical and antitheatrical sentiment. First, the pun on "cun- ning" conveys a decided prejudice against visibly artificial behavior. The cunning of these "cunningly devised implements" lies not only in the smartness of their device, but in their seeming innocence. While the implements appear to offer an improved option over the "old natural methods," they serve instead to separate men and women from their own "Natures." The link Carlyle forges here between mechanization and trickery is one that comes to apply to character, as increasing numbers of industrial moralists regard as "duplicitous" people who seek to detour around "the old natural methods." My second point regards that "natural." Later in the same essay, when Carlyle presents an idea that seems uncannily Butlerian, it becomes clear that the stability of naturalness itself is at stake. Carlyle writes of Rebecca E Stern 433</page><page sequence="12">an inward persuasion [that] has long been diffusing itself and now and then even comes to utterance, That, except the external, there are no true sciences; that to the inward world (if there be any) our only conceivable road is through the outward; that, in short, what cannot be investigated and understood mechanically, cannot be investigated and understood at all. (S, 146-47) This is, at least in part, Judith Butler's argument: we can know the internal only belatedly, only retrospectively, and then only through outward signs. But for Carlyle, this is not enabling but horrific. His argument against this trend returns him immediately to the question and unquestionability of nature. "Consider the great elements of human enjoyment," he writes, "the attainments and possessions that exalt man's life to its present height, and see what part of these he owes to institutions, to Mechanism of any kind; and what to the instinctive, unbounded force, which Nature herself lent him, and still continues to him" (S, 149).34 The return to Nature, and with it to an incontrovertible interiority, counters a potential renunciation of the a priori existence, of the "givenness," of human identity.35 As will prove to be the case for a wide range of Victorian literature, the impetus behind Carlyle's essay is the eradication of the villainous "mechanical character" and the rein- statement of human Nature. The desire for stable, a priori interiority had far reaching effects. With respect to the theater proper, various critics have suggested that, although this era was one in which acting became an increasingly acceptable middle-class vocation, the Victorians continued to regard acting itself as distinctly suspect, as precariously close to lying.36 This aversion seems especially relevant to the prevalence of conduct books and "self-help" manuals in which various authors described and dis- sected acceptable social identities for middle-class men and women. Investments in sincerity and simplicity made denizens of the middle class extremely suspicious of mimicry, acting, and theatricality in gen- eral. Being so new a class themselves, having so indistinct and recently defined parameters of character, they worried about the naturalness of their own behaviors, belying their security in the truth value of their social positions.37 As the historian Marjorie Morgan notes, "At a time when traditional political, social and economic authorities and theories were being questioned and undermined, ambiguity in any form was particularly alarming because it greatly exacerbated the sense of insecu- rity. Late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century attitudes to theatrical performances and language, for example, clearly revealed an increasing unwillingness to tolerate ambiguity."38 434 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="13">Dinah Mulock Craik's letter to her friend, Miss Dickens, about an unnamed actor demonstrates this characteristic ambivalence about performance as Craik shrinks from theatricality, even though she is at the theater: We were at Hamlet last night-in the dress circle-and found it better than ever. He gives the tenderness of Hamlet's nature in a way quite over-coming. Only I wish he would die subtlely and not drop at length on the stage .... I am sure, in nature, Horatio would support him and not let him fall flat till long after he was dead.39 Craik's resistance to the actor's "fall[ing] flat," to dying without subtlety, should not, perhaps, be surprising. Visibly mimicking the motions of death in such a way as to make the mimicry visible, the actor calls attention to the fact that he is indeed acting. Defying the "nature" that would have him cradled by Horatio, the actor generates a performance that proves more jarring than tragic. Within the contexts of Ruskinian aesthetics, to which I will turn in a moment, one might say that the actor makes it too clear that he is using his body as a machine. As George Henry Lewes notes in the epistle that serves to introduce Actors and the Art of Acting, most Victorians did not like to think even of literal acting as something which required rehearsal or craft. "It is noticeable," he writes, "that people generally overrate a fine actor's genius, and underrate his trained skill. They are apt to credit him with a power of intellectual conception and poetic creation to which he has really a very slight claim, and fail to recognize all the difficulties which his artistic training have enabled him to master."40 It seems in no way insignificant, then, that the most popular actors of the age were those who were thought not to be acting at all. Ellen Terry was famous for always seeming herself, for never allowing the audience to forget that, behind every role and beneath every costume, she was always consis- tently Ellen Terry.41 Henry Irving, too, played "only one part"; George Bernard Shaw's obituary of the actor is a testimony to Irving's remark- able fixity of character over a long and successful career: this artist, who could produce every illusion about himself off the stage by the mere force and singularity of his personality, was prevented by just this force and singularity from producing any great range of illusion on it. He had really only one part; and that part was the part of Irving. ... His huge and enduring success as Shylock was due to his absolutely refusing to allow Shylock to be the discomfited villain of the piece. The "Merchant of Venice" became the Martyr- dom of Irving .... [H]e had no power of adapting himself to an Rebecca F. Stern 435</page><page sequence="14">author's conception: his creations were all his own; and they were all Irvings.42 As Nina Auerbach has argued, the Victorian aversion to performativity presented a rather thorny problem with respect to identity: "it is scarcely possible to be ourselves without acting ourselves," she writes, "but to be sincere, we must not act.'"43 In keeping with this prejudice against theatricality, Victorian conduct book and political writers alike requested that their readers, in assembling the aspects of better, more polite, more moral selves, forget that they were performing. In his later Heroes and Hero Worship, for example, Carlyle exhorts man to develop himself-"to speak-out, to act-out, what Nature has laid in him."44 Carlyle's neat conflation of the natural with the performative enables the process of becoming what Auerbach terms a "best self' to be posited as a natural process of discovery rather than one of manufacturing a new and potentially artificial self. By making his definition of "acting out" one which relies upon discovering that which is already inside, Carlyle protects his new, improved self from the taint of repetition. Similarly, John Ruskin's rhetoric in assailing what he finds to be a demoralizing, perfectionist, imitative trend in Classical style is, like Carlyle's appeal in "Signs of the Times," nearly identical to the rhetoric of labor reform. In "The Nature of Gothic," perhaps the most famous essay from The Stones of Venice, Ruskin exalts the democratic, human- istic aspects of Gothic over the repressive, fascistic qualities of Classical architecture. He argues against Classical architecture on the basis that it takes away the humanity of the workers who construct it. For Ruskin, value inheres in that which celebrates the human rather than the mechanical. He takes issue with Classicism, then, because it forgets that "the vital ingredient of all products is invention. . . . Classicism," he argues, "only imitates and repeats."45 In a now familiar rhetoric, although here located in an aesthetic field, Ruskin finds that the symmetry, perfection, and regularity of Classical forms make literally inhuman demands upon men, and so automatize them: You must either make a tool of a creature, or a man of him. You cannot make both. Men were not intended to work with the accuracy of tools, to be precise and perfect in all their actions. If you will have that precision out of them, and make their fingers measure degrees like cog-wheels, and their arms strike curves like compasses, you must unhumanise them. (N, 222-23) The requirements of Classical (and traditional English) buildings are 436 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="15">"unhumanising" because they render workers tools or machines, impos- ing themselves directly upon the workers' bodies so that their fingers must be "cog-wheels," their arms "compasses," and their actions testi- monies to the principles of regularity and sameness. "If you will make a man of the working creature," Ruskin writes, "you cannot make a tool. Let him but begin to imagine, to think, to try to do anything worth doing; and the engine-turned precision is lost at once. Out come all his roughness, all his dulness, all his incapability . . .but out comes the whole majesty of him also" (N, 223). Where Ruskin finds Classical architecture's imitative requirements dehumanizing, he finds beauty in the tremendous variety of the Gothic, the diversity of its ornaments and forms. "Every building of the Gothic period differs in some important respect from every other," he argues, and the uniqueness of each Gothic building testifies to "certain mental tendencies of the builders, legibly expressed in it; as fancifulness, love of variety, love of richness, and such others" (N, 213-15). Later in the essay, Ruskin clarifies his antipathy towards repetition, arguing that "great art ... does not say the same thing over and over again"; rather, he claims, it "consists in its saying new and different things" (N, 234-35). As many critics have noted, Ruskin's aesthetic criticism may often more aptly be called social commentary; his remarks about architectural characteristics are often thinly, if at all, veiled expositions on national and/or personal character. As C. M. Finn writes, "Gothic [architecture] has a significance far beyond questions of structure or even aesthetics. The vigour of Gothic accompanies the moral and spiritual health of a society, and its decline is a sure sign of the loss of strength of a culture."46 Ruskin's ostensible purpose in this essay is to restore creativity, and hence dignity, to the industrial working classes who have been "counted off into a heap of mechanism, numbered with its wheels, and weighed with its hammer strokes." However, while the class commentaries in "The Nature of Gothic" are remarkable in and of themselves, Ruskin's object seems to exceed the liberty and dignity of the working classes. His comments on the middle-class "Love of Order which makes us desire that our house windows should pair like our carriage horses, and allows us to yield our faith unhesitatingly to architectural theories which fix a form for everything, and forbid variation from it" liken the figure of the worker enslaved to an imitative craft which strips him of judgment, to the English middle class and their readily yielded "faith" in fixed forms of conduct that demand imitation (N, 225-26, 233). When Ruskin argues, "what we have to do with our laborers [is] to look for the thoughtful part of them, and get that out of them, whatever Rebecca E Stern 437</page><page sequence="16">we lose for it" (N, 222), he, like many other moralists, suggests that the problem with imitation is that it is not enough bound up with thought. Ultimately, however, Ruskin's objections to imitation have more to do with the fact that mimicry produces what he considers an "unnatural" condition than with the nature of copying work itself. Above and beyond the problem of intellectual involvement, the repetitive, imitative aspects of identity are disturbing in that they suggest the ways in which even human "nature" is ultimately assembled. Ruskin's imperative "never [to] encourage imitation or copying of any kind, except for the sake of preserving record of great works" relegates imitation and "copying" per se to some place beyond the sacred "Nature" of the essay's title (N, 227). By objecting to copying as an activity that threatens the nature of human Nature, Ruskin reveals a common fear that human identity owes a great deal more to repetition than most nineteenth-century writers would have liked to admit. As Morgan writes, by the late eighteenth century, "that people were the creatures of imitation . . . became a source of alarm."47 Mrs. John Sandford's position neatly represents the contradictory and precarious stance of many of these authors: she wants no part of imitation in her concept of adult identity, but, in her chapter on taste, she marries her injunctions to "cultivate the moral feelings" with others to "read the best authors-study the best models" (F, 236). The tensions between these two agendas become even more striking in discussions of human development. Imitation, after all, is fundamental to establishing right thought in the first place and nearly all social reformers stressed the importance of role models. The "nature" of childhood makes many essentialist arguments untenable, however, and conduct writers in particular struggled to reconcile equivocal conten- tions about authenticity and repetition, about natural identity and the importance of example. "CHILDHOOD IS LIKE A MIRROR": AN ARMY OF TINY REPEATERS Cautions regarding children's propensities for mimicry appeared ironically and repeatedly in conduct books. The tone and the prevalence alone of these warnings establishes that many Victorians were quite anxious about the fact that children seemed to be "natural imitators." The ideological contradictions contained herein were sufficiently trou- bling to demand nearly acrobatic rhetorical contortions in order to accommodate them. In the following excerpt, for example, Sandford grapples with her son's ready acknowledgment that his religious beliefs are reducible to imitation: 438 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="17">On [his] being asked why he believed in such a doctrine? "Because mamma told me," was his reply. The answer, it must be confessed, was not satisfactory; but it was natural; and it stated probably the true ground upon which early faith rests. Veneration is a prominent feature in the young mind; and until it is counteracted by the growth of other faculties, and the operation of external causes, it has the greatest share in determining the early character. (F, 32, emphasis added) The "growth of other faculties" is crucial to the stability of individual, legitimate character, and the strong emphasis on the development of reasoning faculties is typical of Victorian conduct and political literature alike. Sandford calls in these "other faculties" to establish and protect a singular, humanist subject from the horrors of metonymy, from the shame of the artificial self; likewise, the label, "natural," and the term, "venera- tion," function to defend against the specter of the child-born-automaton. The consistency with which these writers invoke the protective power of individual reason, however, belies their confidence in it as an adequate rejoinder to the questions posed by primary repetition. The stakes of mounting a strong defense appear quite vividly in Sandford's concern that, without those faculties that bring the child beyond the realm of mimicry, "knowledge attained of even primary truths is scanty and superficial" (F, 36). Here as elsewhere, the category of "primary truth" depends heavily upon a subject's ability to distinguish it from "superficiality"; here as elsewhere, this distinction seems troublingly precarious. Although many conduct books "urged parents to take meticulous care in setting morally sound behavioral examples for their children, and encouraged youngsters to imitate and be unquestioningly obedient to their parents," this blithe impetus to imitation had certain undesirable consequences. Morgan notes that "it became imperative to resolve the question of how children steeped in the virtues of emulation were to limit their propensity for imitating once they were no longer protected by the safeguards of parental supervision.""48 As Morgan suggests, this army of young imitators grew markedly less appealing as they outgrew their youth, for the skills that constituted model children presented, in maturity, quite a problem for political and other reformers. The process of maturation, then, was to involve a sloughing off of the mechanics of imitation, so that the graceful dance into Victorian adulthood involved a repression of plagiarism. Ideally, these young mimics, in part through mastering that which they had previously imitated and in part through erasing any memory of the original, would be able to claim their actions as uniquely their own. Samuel Smiles's highly deterministic Happy Homes and the Hearts That Make Them suggests, however, that childhood repetition is Rebecca E Stern 439</page><page sequence="18">unnervingly enduring: "Childhood," Smiles writes, "is like a mirror which reflects in after life the images first presented to it."49 According to Smiles, then, juvenile imitation does not end with puberty, but rather infects life after childhood. Smiles's axiom was particularly threatening because most Victorians regarded childhood as the most "natural" period of life; children's propensities for mimicry thus posed a substantial threat to the original- ity and primacy of Nature itself. If people were indeed imitators, if their innermost feelings and all that felt most natural to them could be reduced to things they had learned and replicated, the distinctions between human beings and the feared automatons of industrial rhetoric were not comfortably secure. One can see these greater underlying anxieties in Sandford's imperative that children "not be able to detect any thing but truth in the actions, and words and manners, of those around them" lest they be led to imitate them, for "affectation ... will soon appear in them, if they observe it in their teachers" (F, 238, author's emphasis). That "truth," unfortunately for Sandford, is rather flimsy stuff. As Craik writes, "to very few people-as may be noticed of most small children-does truth, this rigid, literal veracity, come by nature .. . it comes only after the self-control, watchfulness, and bitter experience of years."50 Craik's point, that "Nature" and "Truth" are incompatible terms, that truth is something one must work towards, rather than something one is born with, redefines the parameters of "true identity," so that it is more of a goal than a given. In the interests of maintaining phenomenological integrity, many social reformers redefined their parameters of consciousness, so that both alongside and contrary to Ruskin's exaltation of the "thoughtful part" of men, Victorian writers coached their readers to be somewhat less thoughtful, less conscious-in short, they advised them to protect against self-consciousness. If one did not watch oneself too carefully, did not examine oneself and the machinations behind one's gestures and words, imitation might yet remain unconscious and unknown. If one was able to "forget" one's good models and yet still produce acceptable behavior, who was to say that one's identity was not authentic? "GENIUS IS EVER A SECRET TO ITSELF": THE PROBLEM OF SELF- CONSCIOUSNESS Carlyle's "Characteristics," written in 1831, opens the question of self-consciousness that poses so great a problem for nearly all of these writers, although perhaps especially for Mill. In "Characteristics," Carlyle equates vitality with "unconsciousness" (his own term), so that 440 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="19">"the truly strong mind, view it as Intellect, as Morality, or under any other aspect, is nowise the mind acquainted with its own strength." Self- consciousness, Carlyle feels, makes actions "mechanical," not "vital," for consciousness leads to doubt: "Self-contemplation is infallibly the symptom of disease" (S, 314-16). Locating the germ of this problem in industrialization, Carlyle waxes nostalgic for pre-industrial (read "sim- pler") times: "action, in those old days was easy, was voluntary, for the divine worth of human things lay acknowledged; Speculation was wholesome, for it ranged itself as the handmaid of Action; what could not so range itself died out by its natural death." The "speculation," or introspection, that plagues nineteenth-century society, however, pro- duces only doubt about the value of "human things," about what things humans are supposed to make, or do, or be, and about whether or not they are any longer capable of dying a "natural death," let alone of living a "natural" life. For Carlyle and others like him, self-consciousness is so disabling as to produce a situation in which people must "struggle to be persons, not machines" (S, 335-36). The specifically theatrical valence of "speculation" or "self-contem- plation" is most evident in the "spectator" hidden in the former term. Not only does the watching or audience function seated within Carlyle's self-conscious self enact and implement a "supervisory authority bent on demystifying everything but itself," it also produces a divided self that acts and does and thinks in a fashion neither unitary nor simple.5' It institutes a specular function that checks for imperfections and impro- prieties and hence, through its careful watching, puts its own actions on stage.52 By making visible the performative components of identity, self- consciousness threatens to produce the "mechanical character" against which these writers expostulate. As Mill writes in On Liberty, his contemporaries, instead of simply acting-or acting simply-subject each of their actions to careful analysis, hence robbing themselves of sincerity: "They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances?... Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of ... until by dint of not following their own nature they have no nature to follow." 53 In the fifth chapter of his Autobiography, Mill writes about the breakdown he suffered in his early twenties. Describing his younger self as "a 'made' or manufactured man, having had a certain impress of opinion stamped on me which I could only reproduce," Mill demon- strates the dangers of allowing childhood repetition to remain discern- ible in adult life (A, 93). "I had always heard it maintained by my father, Rebecca E Stern 441</page><page sequence="20">and was myself convinced," he writes, "that the object of education should be to form the strongest possible associations ... with all things beneficial to the great whole, and of pain with all things hurtful to it" (A, 82). Although Mill claims to have had no doubt of the efficiency of behaviorist methods to form associations through repeated rewards and punishments, his breakdown leads him to reconsider. He comes to believe that, ultimately, "there must always be something artificial and casual in associations thus produced. The pains and pleasures thus forcibly associated with things, are not connected with them by any natural tie" (A, 83, author's emphasis). In other words, education must be reinforced by nature, not simply by repetition. Rote learning is too vulnerable to analysis, Mill painfully learns, as it enables that which should be "natural" to dissolve all too readily. Mill finds, too, that the "feelings" that are supposed to form the basis of his world view disintegrate under the rigorous and relentless analyses that form the basis of his education. "The habit of analysis," he writes, "has a tendency to wear away the feelings ... and the analysing spirit remains without its natural complements and correctives. . . . My education, I thought, had failed to create these feelings in sufficient strength to resist the dissolving influence of analysis" (A, 83, 84). Endowed with an intellect capable of deconstructing all that comes before it, Mill is unable to find either sufficient reason or adequate fiction to make life endurable; he suffers a breakdown in 1826. Mill attributes his "healthier," retrospective outlook to a refusal to examine the foundations of his identity. Ascribing his breakdown to an excess of self-consciousness, Mill finds that the only way to be happy in life is not to question overmuch its foundations. This latter outlook depends upon "a theory of life, very unlike that on which I had before acted, and having much in common with what at that time I certainly had never heard of, the anti-self-consciousness theory of Carlyle. ... The enjoyments of life (such was now my theory) are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing, when they are taken en passant, without being made a principal object. Once make them so, and they are immediately felt to be insufficient. They will not bear a scrutinizing influence" (A, 85-86). The defense against this scrutiny lies in what Ann Cvetkovich and other critics have observed about the Victorians' emphasis on affect as guarantor of genuine personhood. "Capitalism's perceived ability to dehumanize," Cvetkovich argues, "necessitates the reassuring produc- tion of affect that guarantees individual subjectivity."54 Given this context, it is not surprising to find that Mill attributes the turning point of his depression to the moment at which he realized he was capable of 442 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="21">crying. Because this appeal to emotion functions as an appeal to interiority, it seeks to ensure that "the only conceivable road" to the inward is not "through the outward," as Carlyle had worried, above. Another of the central problems with self-consciousness, then, is that it makes it nearly impossible to keep one's emotions "inside"; if one is always watching one's own responses, it is rather difficult to keep them "off stage" and beyond the realm of manufacture. WHEREFORTH NATURE? There were limits, of course, to the acceptable scope of personal affect; the enforcement of those limits returns me to Ellis. Seemingly antithetical to her earlier tirade against the self-consciously self-con- structing woman, the following excerpt finds Ellis urging her readers to imitate precisely-indeed robotically-the models of deportment with which she presents them: Let no one in her blindness or temerity, venture upon the slightest transgression of these rules, because in her young wisdom she sees no cause for their existence. Society has good reasons for planting this friendly hedge, beside the path of woman, and the day will come when she will be thankful-truly thankful that her own conduct even in minute and apparently trifling matters, was not left in early life to the decision of her own judgment, or the guidance of her will. (D, 125) Within the context of Victorian anxieties about self-consciousness, it becomes clear that Ellis's investments in shaping genuine identity are not antithetical to-are, in fact, compatible with-her abnegation of individual will. Ellis's invocations to personal surrender have a religious valence, certainly, but evangelicalism fails to account for her pirouettes around the troublingly mechanical and troublingly theatrical problems of self-conscious imitation. The following, from her introduction to The Daughters of England, demonstrates how thoroughly anti-construction- ism imbricates her more overt religious agenda: My desire is to assist them to overcome the three great enemies to their temporal and eternal good-their selfishness, indolence, and vanity, and to establish in their stead feelings of benevolence and habits of industry, so blended with Christian meekness, that while affording pleasure to all who live within the sphere of their influ- ence, they shall be unconscious of the charm by which they please." (D, 10, emphasis added) By promising her readers that their submission to her dictates will grant them a character both more pious and less aware of itself, Ellis links Rebecca F Stern 443</page><page sequence="22">"Christian meekness" to amnesiac self-construction. The inattention she demands ("they shall be unconscious of the charm by which they please") asks young women to learn what is pleasing, but to forget to look for its effects, while her condemnation of selfishness and vanity addresses directly the dangers of conscious intent in repetition and so defends against conscious self-manufacture. Unfortunately, Ellis leaves no agent in place to instigate action. According to this schema, these ideal young ladies, like Ruskinian Angels, or Stepfordian wifelets, are to perform automatically and unconsciously acts that are gratifying to others. Ellis's suggestions are of precisely that sort that provoked Mill's most scathing attacks on conduct materials; ironically, many of his ideals prove to be surprisingly close to hers. As Stefan Collini notes, although "Mill was uneasy with the element of 'self-abnegation' . . . fostered by the popular ideal of character, . . . he profoundly shared many of the beliefs upon which that ideal rested.""55 Even as Mill asks why people who "do the old things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings," he is unable to forgo completely the principle of imitation (0, 78). On Liberty, that text in Mill's oeuvre perhaps most committed to human individuality, makes this conflict particularly evident. In it, Mill argues that subservience to social norms and proprieties threatens social stability; unexamined artificiality, he claims, makes a society vulnerable to anything "real." The notion of "realness" he offers, however, is just as much bound by the principles and tensions of repetition as Ellis's: There is only too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and there should be no reason why civilization should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. (0, 78) Although here Mill attacks the repetitive, performative, not "really alive" aspects of a culture enslaved to imitation, his remarks on China in the same essay endorse an imitative approach. Condemning Western Europe for "decidedly advancing toward the Chinese ideal of making all people alike," Mill nonetheless continues to rely upon the rhetoric of the good model for his solution to the situation in China. "If they [the Chinese] are ever to be farther improved," he writes, "it must be by foreigners" (0, 87-88). In order to be "saved," that is, the Chinese need to make themselves after new and supposedly better models. In effect, 444 Situating Victorian Antitheatricality</page><page sequence="23">the "tendency ... to degenerate into the mechanical" and the principles of self-improvement rely equally upon a repetition that both constitutes and threatens Nature. Repetition offers a bridge between antitheatrical and anti-mechanical agendas so as to provide a different perspective on Victorian literature and culture. The scope of this article allows me only to gesture towards the ways in which this perspective might influence readings of more specifically literary texts, but I will offer a few brief suggestions. This correspondence makes it no coincidence that such industrial novels as Middlemarch, Mary Barton, and Shirley exhibit so much concern about genuine subjectivity. Beyond the entangled marriage and industrial conflict plots of these novels, the entangled antitheatrical and anti- mechanical biases I have been exploring here relate as well to the economics in novels such as Little Dorrit, where fraudulent identity relates directly to capitalist fraud. This concordance may also be tied to the sensation novel's often nightmarish depictions of an impersonal culture in which multiplications of identity seem not only possible but almost commonplace. Overall, this reading strategy enables Victorian authors' simultaneous renunciations and venerations of Nature, their demands for sincerity alongside their pleas for possible transcendence, to take on significances that may else have gone unrecognized. The relation- ship between antitheatricality and the project of establishing authentic subjectivity is already well-established in both cultural and performance studies; the intersections between that nexus and anti-mechanical sensi- bilities expand the parameters of this conflict, bringing the potential for new insights to previously obscure tensions and alliances.

Barish defines theater only in its most literal sense, however, rarely remarking upon any more abstract notion of performance, rarely moving beyond solid material stages. Michael Booth offers interest- ing work in the history of the theater, but his definition of theatricality is similarly prosaic. Tracy C.

Many scholars did not seriously consider the political importance of conduct materials, perhaps because of an investment in preserving the order and convenience of the doctrine of separate spheres. More recent critics, however-most notably Nancy Armstrong, Mary Poovey, and D. A. Miller-have undone that tidy division. As Armstrong writes in Desire and Domestic Fiction ([New York: Oxford, 1987], 10): "political events cannot be understood apart from women's history, from the history of women's literature, or from changing representations of the household." Historian Stefan Collini reinforces, although indirectly, the importance to the study of identity construction of considering conduct writers' strategies andfoci. "The ideal of character" he writes, "enjoyed a prominence in the political thought of the Victorian period that it had apparently not known before" (Public Moralists: Political Thought and Intellectual Life in Britain 1850-1930 [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991], 94). Collini's work, however, is indicative of a practice that still does not read these authors together. Collini is definitely more interested in male political writers' investments in character than in conduct, per se; he cites not a single conduct book by or for women. As a result, he leaves domesticity out of the political picture nearly altogether and so preserves what I Rebecca E Stern 447</page><page sequence="26">will be arguing is a spurious distinction between male and female, between domestic and political ideals of character. 32 Mrs. John Sandford, Female Improvement (London: Spottiswoode and Shaw, [1836]), 237, 222; Sandford's italics.

Herbert LeSourd Creek (New York: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1939), 141. This collection is hereafter cited parenthetically in the text by page and abbreviated S. 34 Carlyle continues this metaphor of a world turned machine throughout his career, although perhaps most notably in Sartor Resartus, in which Teufelsdr6ckh writes that, for him, "the Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even of Hostility: it was one huge, dead immeasurable Steam-engine, rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb from limb" (Sartor Resartus, ed. Peter Sabor and Kerry McSweeney [New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1987], 127). 35 One might also see this as a potential renunciation of the human spirit, and to renounce spirit is impossible in a Carlylian system. Although it is not Christian, Carlyle's definition of spirituality motivates the great bulk of his work; furthermore it is what saves him and his theories from the threat of constructionism. Carlyle finds holiness in what he terms "vitalism" and it is this which he finds endangered by early nineteenth- century industrialism. 36 See, for example, Davis, and the fourth and fifth chapters of Mary Jean Corbett, Representing Femininity: Middle-Class Subjectivity in Victorian and Edwardian Women's Autobiographies (New York: Oxford, 1992). 37 The remarkable energy that went into regulating sartorial signification in the Victorian home, for example, testifies to tremendous anxieties about the stability (or lack thereof) of various power relationships and the failure of clothing to maintain them. Dinah Mulock Craik's concerned meditation about Mrs. Smith's dress being the only thing that distinguishes Mrs. Smith from her cook is emblematic of conduct writings on this subject. Craik's contention that "the more intelligent of her servants soon find out that [Mrs. Smith] is 'not a lady;' that, in fact, if one were to strip off her satin gowns, and sell her carriage and make her inhabit the basement-story instead of the drawing-room of her handsome house, Mrs. Smith would be not one whit superior to her own cook," indicates that Mrs. Smith's character unravels all too easily into its superficial compo- nent parts. Dinah Mulock Craik, A Woman's Thoughts About Women (London: Hurst and Blackett, 1858), 127. Craik is far from being the sole conduct writer to address the problem of servants dressing "above their station." Ellis presents an interesting alternative to sartorial superiority when she asks, "shall we continue to compete with our servants in dress ... or shall we ... compete with them in self-denial?"

Ruskin's Praeterita, for example, takes such a very narrow viewpoint as "privileged seer" that, as Regenia Gagnier notes, he "denies his own subjectivity, leaves himself unseen" (Subjectivities: A History of Self- Representation in Britain, 1832-1920 [New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1991], 240). As Ruskin writes in Praeterita, "all my faculty was merely in showing that such and such things were so; I was no orator, no actor, no painter but in a minute and generally invisible manner" (cited in Gagnier, 243).
