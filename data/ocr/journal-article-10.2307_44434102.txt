(SP-405) One Hundred Years of the Otto-Cycle Engine. H. J. Gibson, Ethyl Corporation Re- search Laboratories. This paper is presented in observance of the centennial of the Otto-Cycle engine. Although it briefly traces the history of the engine, it is largely devoted to the dramatic effects that the engine and the vehicles it powers have had on the way people live. The economic importance of automotive transportation in the United States and the rest of the world is discussed, as are the relative roles of mass transit and automobiles in moving people. 760002. Field Experience with Smaller Cars. C. R. Cree, B. D. Keller and D. S. Gray, Amoco Oil Co. Because of the current interest in smaller cars, starting and warmup performance, emissions, fuel economy, accel- eration performance, and frequency of maintenance data were studied for 17 "small" cars of Amoco Oil's 1974-75 test car fleet. These cars encompassed a broad range of domestic production and also included a car with a diesel engine and a car with a stratified-charge engine. Cold starting and warmup were less of a problem with the 1975 cars than with the 1974's. Gasoline volatility studies with three of the 1974 model cars showed that cold starting and warmup performance was markedly reduced when using fuels with high 10%, 50% and 90% evaporated temper- atures. The diesel car could not be started below -9°C (15°F) on the road or -18°C (0°F) in chassis dynamom- eter studies, and ability to start was highly correlated with fuel cetane number. These cars, in general, met the prevailing emissions standards at 6440 km and the diesel and stratified-charge engine cars were outstanding in this respect. Although the 1974 and 1975 cars gave similar fuel consumption on a kilometers per liter basis, the heavier 1975's were more efficient on a kilogram-kilometers per liter basis. In this respect, the diesel car was best while the stratified-charge car was rather poor. Carburetors re- quired frequent servicing, primarily chokes, and two cars required valve guide servicing due to excessive wear. 760003. Fuel Economy Improvements Through Emissions Inspection/Maintenance. J. Panzer, Exxon Re- search and Engineering Company. A study was carried out that permitted determination of the impact of annual emissions inspection/maintenance on fuel economy. When 50% of a car population was rejected for high emissions and tuned up, the estimated gain in fuel economy among the rejected cars was 13%. This effect was calculated by quantifying the effects of individual engine malfunctions on fuel economy and applying the results statistically to a car population whose distribution of malfunctions was known. The approach used permitted calculation of fuel economy effects when distributions of some car characteristics, driving patterns, and engine malfunctions are known. The results apply only to pre- 1975 cars. It was found that repairs carried out to correct only emissions should produce about three- quarters of the fuel economy benefit achieved by a complete tune-up. When deterioration between annual inspections was considered, and 50% of the car population was rejected for high emissions, the net gain in fuel economy among the rejected cars was about 7.5%, which was significant at the 95% confidence level. The net gain in fuel economy among rejected cars was not statistically significant at rejection rates lower than 30%. When the effect of repairing the 50% highest emitters was spread over the total car population, the estimated 2% fuel economy benefit was not significant. 760005. Automotive Mirror Size Requirements Based on Field of View Considerations. James W. Seeser, Hope College. The results of a two mirror computer model of automotive rear vision based on a minimum field of view approach are presented. A system of conventions for the rear vision target, minimum field of view, head positioning, mirror orientation, and head rotation is used to parameterize computer results in terms of the position of the center of the inside mirror and the left outside mirror. General results for the minimum horizontal mirror size and driver head turn required to see the target are presented. Superimposed on the results are several existing auto- motive models. A sensitivity analysis is performed to indicate the sensitivity mirror size to various parameters in the model. The results indicate that the mirror size is particularly dependent on the transverse eye-mirror distance. 1976 SA E Transactions 760006. Evaluation of a New Automotive Plane and Convex Mirror System By Government Drivers. Charles H. Kaehn, Natl. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation. An on-the-road study was made by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with the coop- eration of the General Services Administration of new mirror system consisting of larger inside and left side plane mirrors and a convex mirror on the right fender. Approximately 150 Federal drivers evaluated this exper- imental mirror system on a test fleet of 23 passenger cars located at four sites for a six month period starting in September 1974. An analysis of the questionnaires completed by the drivers shows that in general drivers reacted favorably to this experimental convex mirror system. Comparisons are made with the results of earlier field tests conducted with a periscopic device and with two different experimental convex mirror systems. 760007. Heat Transfer in a Piston of a Four Stroke Diesel Engine. M. Ramchandani, Applied Technology Associates, Inc.; and N. D. Whitehouse, Insti- tute of Science and Technology, University of Manchester (United Kingdom). A design tool for analyzing heat flow rates through pistons is presented. Tests on a Petter PJIW engine were carried out over a 15</page><page sequence="3">760008 - 760014 range of conditions covering different fuel inputs, speeds, boost pressures and intake temperatures. The steady state temperatures were determined by stainless steel inserts and these, with an aid of an electrolytic analogue, provided isothermal plots of a PJIW piston. The isotherms were optimized numerically by a two-dimensional relax- ation program giving master temperature and heat flux patterns that are valid for all engine conditions. The calculated mean heat transfer rates through the piston tend to support the trends suggested by Annanďs semianalytical correlation. 760008. Analysis of Piston Ring Lubrication. Pranab K. Das, John Deere Product Engineering Center. An analysis and a method of computation of the oil film thickness between the piston ring and cylinder liner of an internal combustion engine is presented here. A three- dimensional form of Reynolds' equation is used to enable consideration of film thickness variation in the cir- cumferential direction. Various ring face profiles are considered in the analysis. The "tipping" of the ring about the piston axis is also included in the calculation. The solution of the resultant lubrication equation is achieved by using a finite difference approximation. 760009. Plain Bearings for the High Speed Diesel Engine. C. H. Davison, Vandervell Products, Ltd. (Unit- ed Kingdom). The outlook forecast for truck diesel engines indicates that higher specific loadings will occur on the connecting rod and main journal bearings. Materials available for this situation are discussed. However, for the less demanding diesel engine application the use of reinforced plastic lined bearings may be a possible trend. Means of assessing bearing performance are examined together with new methods of bearing production that will certainly be introduced to increase bearing output and improve economic viability in the diesel automotive range. Some design considerations are discussed regarding connecting rod and main journal bearings when operating under the expected higher duties. 760010. The Application of High Strength Steel to Bumper Reinforcements. Victor A. Kortesoja, Metal Stamping Div., Ford Motor Co. Federal Standards have been placed on motor vehicles which set standards on the amount of vehicle damage after front and rear end tests. To meet the requirements, bumper reinforcements are used. On the first design, regular low carbon steel was used. After redesign, high strength steel has been used very successfully. 760011. Tooling Considerations in the Use of High Strength Low Alloy Steel. R. J. Marks, Olds- mobile Div., General Motors Corp. Some new and unfamiliar rules have been established in the manufacture of sheet metal stampings made from high strength low alloy steel with yield strengths up to 80,000 P.S.I. 760012. Weight Reduction of Automobile Bumper Sys- tems. John J. Kary, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Weight reductions in automobile bumper systems were achieved by means of a three phase program: 1. Reduction of bumper reinforcement gauge by use of work hardening renitrogenized steel. 2. Reduction of bumper face bar gauge by use of high formability, high yield strength, inclusion shape control steel. 3. Design changes to minimize or eliminate bumper reinforcements. The weight reductions were achieved without reducing the impact strength of the bumper systems. 760013. The Development and Performance of a Self- Contained Solid State Digital Crash Recorder for Anthropomorphic Dummies. Stanley H. Backaitis, Natl. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation; Edwin M. Trout, Federal Aviation Administration; and Randolph J. Wolf, Kaman Sciences Corp. A solid state, low power, self-contained digital crash recorder was developed and installed in the Part 572 crash test dummy for capturing and storing the crash severity- time event. The crash recorder is capable of recording upon internal triggering command the dummy's response in 10 separate data channels. The recorder's performance was evaluated in laboratory and vehicle tests consisting of simulated and real rigid barrier collisions in the forward impact mode and moving barrier collisions in side impacts. The recorder was found to be suitable for capturing and storing high quality crash data compatible with currently used hardwire data acquisition techniques. 760014. Power and Bodily Injury. Francis A. DiLorenzo, Natl. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation. This paper attempts to establish a correlation between bodily injury and the rate at which energy (power) is transferred to the body. Two head impacts are analyzed to demonstrate the procedures, however, analysis results are given for eleven head impacts. The methods involve the fundamental laws of mechanics and only the power levels are established empirically. Equations are developed that relate power to the absolute values of acceleration and the product of momentum and jerk. From the derived mathematical expressions a procedure for analyzing experimental data is given. The appendix contains a computer program for performing the analysis. Lastly arguments are given that predict the ideal processes for changing energy levels. Although the procedures de- scribed in this paper address only the human tolerances, it is conceivable the same procedure may be useful for analysis of inorganic structures. 16</page><page sequence="4">760017-760021 760017. Engine Mass Air Flow Meter. Bernard C. Carimeli and Fred L. Zeisler, Ford Motor Co. Although it has long been recognized that tight air to fuel ratio control under all engine operating conditions should improve engine fuel economy and simplify emissions control, economical, precision and packageable devices for measuring these parameters have not been available for engine control application. Fuel and air input systems, consequently, have continued to rely on other alternate methods of controlling the air to fuel mix. In recent years, advancements in both sensor and electronic technology have begun to make available to the engine control systems engineer compact, high accura- cy/reliability devices that offer possibilities of even tighter fundamental controls. At Ford Motor Company, one such car engineering concept that has been under development for several years is a precision engine air input measuring meter. Using both temperature and pressure sensors to normalize incoming air calculations, this vortex shedding principle meter constantly reports at a high electronic data rate the mass air inflow to the engine. Key elements of this composite device are economical, wide range, high accuracy sensors. 760018. Air Flow Measurement for Engine Control. Robert D. Joy, J-TEC Associates, Inc. A search for improved sensors to measure and control engine parameters has grown from an effort to improve the fuel economy and to lower emissions output of automobile engines. One necessary requirement is the accurate measure of engine intake air. If this can be achieved, then the control system designer will be able to determine the correct amount of fuel to be injected for accomplishment of a desired operation. 760019. A New Approach to Flow-metering - Simple Mechanical Device Allows Use of Reasonably Specified Pressure Transducer for Flow and for Total Volume Metering. Art Zias, Natl. Semi- conductor Corp. The measurement of average velocity or kinetic energy of moving fluid is most often for the purpose of determining the volumetric rate of fluid flow or the mass rate of fluid flow. The determination of fluid flow rate is most often for the purpose of measurement or control of total accu- mulated fluid volume or fluid mass. Such measurement is called flowmetering. There are many widely differing types of flowmeters available. They can be classified broadly into two groups; one which presents little or no interference or impedance to the flow stream, and one wherein the mechanism of metering significantly influ- ences the flow stream. The low or zero impedance type are exotic and generally require a great deal of specialized knowledge of specific properties of the fluid flowing. For example, the hot wire anemometer type of flowmeter requires precise knowledge of fluid thermal properties as a function of velocity. For another example, the nuclear magnetic resonance type of obstructionless flowmeter requires precise knowledge of the number of hydrogen atoms present per unit volume or mass of fluid. Most commonly used flowmeters partially obstruct or add impedance to the fluid stream. These also fall into two categories; one utilizing mechanisms dependent upon displacement or position change, and the other dependent upon pressure change. The first type, using such com- pliant mechanisms as turbine wheels, sliding capacitor plates, sliding potentiometer contacts, oscillating vanes, suffer the usual array of problems associated with precision machines with moving parts. They are delicate, expensive, and require watchmaker caliber labor to build and repair if accuracy is to be achieved. The type of flowmeter dependent upon pressure change, properly conceived, has no moving parts. In this paper, the traditional pressure transducer flowmeters are described. The pressure/flow square law problem and its relation to accuracy is described. A novel solution to the square law accuracy problem is offered. Pressure transducer accuracy is examined. A technique of improving pressure trans- ducer accuracy in flowmetering is offered. In composite, a new flowmeter design is recommended. 760020. Sensitivity of the Zirconia Oxygen Sensor to Temperature and Flow Rate of Exhaust Gas. William J. Fleming, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The zirconia oxygen sensor provides a feed-back signal for stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (A/F) control of an engine. Precise control of A/F within ± 1% of the stoichiometric point is required for effective operation of a three-way catalyst. Since the ultimate accuracy of the closed loop control system directly depends on the accuracy of the oxygen sensor, the present investigation was undertaken to quantify factors affecting sensor accuracy. Measure- ments were made of the relative importance of engine exhaust flow and exhaust temperature on the voltage output of the zirconia oxygen sensor. A test engine was run on a dynamometer at fixed speed and load. A special arrangement on the exhaust pipe permitted independent adjustment of exhaust flow and exhaust temperature. Coefficients for the differential changes in sensor voltage due to changes of engine air-fuel ratio, exhaust flow, and exhaust temperature were deter- mined. 1976 SA E Transactions 760021. Automotive Turbine Fuel Flow Transducers. Wilfried Baatz, FloScan Instrument Co., Inc. The main requirements for onboard automotive fuel flow sensors include reliability, interchangeability, wide flow range, low pressure drop, and immunity to the highly erratic flow conditions which develop in conventional automotive fuel supply systems. Technical progress in recent years indicates that the turbine transducer will be able to meet all these requirements at competitive cost. 1976 SA E Transactions 17</page><page sequence="5">760022 - 760028 760022. Non-Linear Analysis of Car Body Structure. Yoshihiro Kajio and Ichiro Hagiwara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). This paper describes a non-linear analysis of automobile body structure by the finite element method. Numerical calculations were made for both the roof crush resistance and seat belt anchorage strength of a body structure and were compared with test results. Dynamic analysis was also made by an incremental method similar to that used for the static case. Results calculated for both situations indicate correspondence well with experimental results. 760023. Structural Requirements in Material Substitution for Car-Weight Reduction. David C. Chang and J. William Justusson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The structural characteristics for particular automotive structural components are systematically related to rep- resentative, typical structural design criteria and design constraints for a production vehicle. Based on these relationships, we establish the structural design require- ments to be satisfied when a substitute material is used in an automotive structure. A simplified method is developed for evaluating the desirability of directly substituting materials to reduce the weight of automotive structures. This is done by explicitly relating the change in weight to the corresponding changes in structural characteristics, when a specific mild steel structure is "replaced" by one differing only in material and gage. By means of this method, material trade-offs can be directly evaluated by engineers and designers early in the design stage. Examples are given for aluminum and high-strength steel as candidate substitutes for mild steel. 1976 SA E Transactions 760024. On the Directionality of the Strength of Spot Weld. Seiichi Kaga and Tadakatsu Hotta, Osaka Institute of Technology (Japan); Yoshiaki Yamamoto, Osaka Technical College (Japan); and Koichi Ogawa, University of Osaka Pre- fecture (Japan). In the tensile shearing test of spot weld the load axis is parallel to the surface of the welded plate, while in the cross tensile test it is perpendicular to the surface. But in the case of the service structure, in which the spot weld is used as a joint of plates in the vehicle, the load axis is in various directions. In this report, the strength of spot welds is obtained under various load axes with a new test apparatus. The load axis is changed in the range of 20° to 90°. Under these conditions yielding strength and ultimate strength are obtained. The results are analyzed using a two dimensional photoelastic method. The conclusions obtained are as follows; 1. The maximum strength is not greatly effected by load axis because the sheet is greatly deformed before fracture. 2. Yielding strength is clearly effected by load axis. This is shown with a two dimensional photoelastic test. 760025. Front Brake Interactions with Heavy Vehicle Steering and Handling During Braking. T. D. Gillespie, Ford Motor Co. The increased braking performance required on air-brake equipped commercial vehicles by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 121 results in vehicles with higher front brake torque capacity and greater deceleration capability. Using a simple analytical model, certain mechanisms by which handling during braking is influ- enced by tire characteristics, load transfer during braking, steering system characteristics, brake imbalance, and other factors are demonstrated. In addition, analysis of the steering system shows how steer angle deviations arise from braking and lateral forces acting against compliance of the steering linkage, and the influence of caster geometry on these deviations. To investigate certain quantifiable characteristics of handling performance, the HSRI Directional Response Computer Program for predicting the longitudinal and directional response behavior of trucks was modified to include the effects of a compliant steering system subject to the force and moment inputs of the front tires. Measurement of bias ply truck tire force and moment characteristics for use in the computer simulation revealed that tire aligning torque characteristics reverse in direction at high braking levels and may dominate the effect of geometric caster built into the steering system. Studies utilizing the modified program indicate that (a) no vehicle will stop perfectly straight without driver steering corrections because of steer angle deviations and (b) the steering reactions fed back to the steering wheel during braking may reverse direction with antilock brake cycling, largely because of the reversal of tire aligning torques. A relationship between these steering reactions and front brake torque level is shown. 1976 SA E Transactions 760028. Commercial Vehicle Braking Simulation: Prob- lem or Solution to the Vehicle Manufacturer. R. A. Pepoy, International Harvester Co. Commercial vehicle brake simulations must include non-linear and/or transient conditions. But to the user they must also be competitive tools. One simulation which appears to adequately model these conditions is discussed from a user's point of view where economic restraints place additional burden on the simulation beyond just modeling vehicle performance. The aspects of input definition, verification, confidence in results and accep- tance criteria are considered as they affect the definition of whether the simulation "works" or not. Recommen- dations are made which should lead to a more commer- cially useful tool. The basic factors defined are applicable to other vehicle simulations. 18</page><page sequence="6">760029 - 760033 760029. Effects of Test Speed and Surface Curvature on Cornering Properties of Tires. Marion G. Pot- tinger, Kenneth D. Marshall and Gary A. Arnold, B.F. Goodrich Co. The effect of test speed and surface curvature on tire force and moment properties has been investigated. Lateral force at low slip angles increases linearly 8 to 9 percent for a tenfold increase in test speed. The effect of test speed on tire force and moment properties produces only a modest change in predicted steady state vehicle handling, but a rather significant change in predicted transient vehicle handling. Surface curvature tends to reduce slip and camber generated lateral force and aligning torque, but the effect is extremely complex and no simple flat to curved surface transformation relationship exists. Discussion: Klaus Beer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. 1976 SA E Transactions 760030. Frequency Response of Tires - Slip Angle and Lateral Force. Rüdiger Weber and Hans-Georg Persch, Research Center, Porsche AG (Ger- many). With theoretical studies as well as with practical tests on the subject of driving dynamics, frequency response of tires has to be taken into consideration, as it has been proved that steady state and transient tire properties are quite different from each other. Thus, for example, with sinusoidal slip angle input the ascertainment of a clear dependence of the lateral force on the slip angle is no longer possible. The rates of acceleration of slip angle and longitudinal slip, provoking transient behaviour, are so small that steady state measurements can be taken in exceptional cases only. On the Porsche tire testing rig, rolling wheels were electrohydraulically swivelled around their vertical axis. Frequency responses, ascertained by means of this sinusoidal slip angle input a = a0 sin &lt;ot, will be explained in detail in the present paper. Transient lateral tire properties are shown in a wide range of frequency and speed. Different methods of plotting the results are explained. The relevant tendencies could easily be illustrated on logarithmically divided frequency and speed ordinates. Essential results: The lateral force amplitudes decrease and the phase angles increase as a function of the increase of frequency or the decrease of speed. With high speeds, the dynamic lateral force amplitudes S0 are bigger than the corresponding steady state values Sst. When relating both values to each other, the ampli- tude response S0/Sst becomes sufficiently independent from the slip angle amplitude a0. Within the measuring range, the phase angle may also be considered as independent from a0. Examinations of the influence of path frequency revealed that it may well serve to unify the formation of the phase angle but that it does not affect the amplitude response. Some efforts are made in order to check the influence of parameters as frequency, speed, slip angle amplitude path frequency, weight of tire protector, profile height, tire pressure, wheel load, and tire construction.

G. Pottinger and K. D. Marshall, B.F. Goodrich Co. The effects of tire break-in, roll-to-equilibrium, and mathematical modeling of the tire force and moment data on the evaluation of low slip angle tire lateral force and aligning torque properties is discussed. It is shown that a standardized break-in and testing sequence are critical to valid comparisons of tire lateral force and aligning torque data. The tire relaxation length data required in the design of a steady state lateral force and aligning torque test is presented. The third order polynomial model is proven to be the simplest adequate model for determining cornering coefficient and aligning torque coefficient. Discussion: Klaus Beer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. 1976 SA E Transactions 760032. Tire Transient Force and Moment Response to Simultaneous Variations of Slip Angle and Load. D. J. Schuring and I. Gusakov, Calspan Corp. Nonsteady-state tire tests performed on Calspan's Tire Research Facility (TIRF) showed that at slip angle and load path frequencies of up to 0.2 rad/ft, attenuations of both lateral force and aligning torque are negligibly small. However, both quantities develop considerable lags at low path frequencies and, hence, show appreciable "dynamic" offsets, amounting to about 10% of the maximum steady-state values at 0.05 rad/ft (not uncommon in accident avoidance maneuvers). Actual, double-lane change maneuvers performed on a skid pad with an instrumented full-size passenger car indicated dynamic offsets of about ±90 lb for lateral force and ± 17 ft-lb for aligning torque. These data were reproduced with good accuracy in simulations on TIRF in which both load and slip angle were varied simultaneously in accordance with typical time histories recorded in vehicle tests. It is suggested that these large offsets could significantly influence the dynamic response of vehicles. 760033. Lateral Forces of Passenger Tires and Effects on Vehicle Response During Dynamic Steering. S. A. Lippmann and K. L. Oblizajek, Uniroyal Tire Co. The objective of the investigation is to provide a basis for judging whether or not the dynamic steering adjustments of the tire forces affect vehicle performance in a significant manner. The differential equation of cornering force adjust- ment is developed from experimental data. This equation is applied, for a typical radial ply tire, to a crude but 19</page><page sequence="7">760034 - 760037 sufficient mathematical model of a vehicle. The responses of the vehicle in certain maneuvers differ to some degree when the model is programmed with instantaneously reacting tires or with simulations of actual tires. The authors judge that there are slight and unim- portant effects on the path and heading curves of the vehicle due to the delays in build-up cornering force. On the other hand, there appear to be detectable effects that may be important in the sensory information provided to the driver.

Garbe, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper discusses the systems used by the Office of Mobile Source Air Pollution Control of EPA to measure and analyze automotive sulfuric acid emissions. This system involves mixing the entire vehicle exhaust with dilution air in a dilution tunnel. Sulfuric acid samples are collected by passing a small portion of the dilute exhaust through Fluoropore filters. The sulfuric acid content of the filters is determined by an automated barium chlo- ranilate method. This paper also discusses test results from a number of advanced prototype vehicles including two stratified charge cars, a Dresser carburetor vehicle, three dual catalyst cars, and a 3-way catalyst car. 760036. Effect of Catalyst Operating History on Sulfate Emissions. D. A. Trayser, F. A. Creswick and E. R. Blosser, Batteile Columbus Laboratories; W. R. Pierson, Ford Motor Co.; and R. F. Bauer, Chrysler Corp. This paper describes a chassis-dynamometer study of sulfate formation on a catalyst-equipped automobile under steady-speed and cyclic operating conditions, with particular attention to the effects of preconditioning on sulfate emission rates. The vehicle was a 1973 Ford Torino equipped with monolithic noble metal catalysts and secondary air injection to simulate a 1975 catalytic system. The fuel used was unleaded certification gasoline with a nominal 0.025 weight percent sulfur content. The experimental program consisted of (1) protracted steady-speed driving at five different road speeds up to 60 mi/hr and at idle, ordered in such a way as to show storage/release effects and stabilized sulfate and S02 emission rates; and (2) a series of hot-start FTP-cycle tests initiated with a cold-start FTP test. Sampling for sulfate and S02 measurement was from a dilution tube in which the vehicle exhaust gases were diluted 10:1 with filtered air. Total mass, size distribution, and light scattering properties of the exhaust particulates were also determined. Sulfate emissions increased with decreasing catalyst temperature down to -500 C, approaching 0.1 g/mi under stabilized conditions at the optimum speed, which on this system was 40 mi/hr. At this speed, sulfate comprised 75 to 80 percent of the emitted sulfur and -90 percent of the fuel sulfur consumed. Conversion closely approached the thermodynamic-equilibrium limit at the highest catalyst temperatures (&gt;600 C). Sulfur storage was evident at idle following operation at 50 mi/hr, and also at 20 mi/hr following 60 mi/hr operation. Storage and release integrated over a 2-hour period were less than ±20 percent of fuel sulfur under most of the other changes from one steady speed to another. The storage/release transients were of the order of a few hours. Storage was also evident in the series of 1972 FTP cycles (one cold-start and ten hot-starts in succession), which began after 60 mi/hr preconditioning. Sulfate emission was initially 0.027 g/mi and continued to climb for several cycles towards an asymptote of 0.08 g/mi or 50 percent of the fuel sulfur consumed. There are a number of additional results concerning the acidity, water content, and size distribution of the emitted sulfate aerosol; noble-metal and nitrate emis- sions; and sampling and analysis methodology - all con- firming previously-published information. Discussion: Gary Ter Haar, Ethyl Corp. 1976 SA E Transactions 760037. Vehicle Sulfuric Acid Level Characterization. David C. Irish and R. J. Stefan, Ford Motor Company. This paper describes sulfate emission data that were gathered on a series of 2.3L and 400 CID engine vehicles during a test program conducted from April, 1975, to September, 1975. The sulfate data were obtained from production vehicles, with and without catalysts, as well as prototype vehicles equipped with various advanced con- cept emission control systems such as lean reactor and pre-chamber engines, electronic fuel injection, and three way catalysts. Monolithic and pelleted catalysts, aged 4,000 miles, were tested, with and without thermactor air. A monolithic catalyst, aged 50,000 miles, also was evaluated. Determinations were made of the variability of the sulfate emission data from various test cycles and the effect of catalyst pre-conditioning temperature on initial sulfate test levels was studied. An effect due to the size of the vehicle cooling fan during chassis roll testing also was noted. The 1974 production (non-catalyst) and lean burn prototype (non-catalyst) vehicles convert &lt;2% of con- sumed fuel sulfur to sulfates and are essentially equivalent in this regard. Vehicles with catalysts convert from 1 to 60% of fuel sulfur to sulfates depending upon temperature, oxygen in the exhaust gas, prior catalyst history and test cycles. 1976 SA E Transactions 20</page><page sequence="8">760038 - 760042 760038. Non-Sulfate Particulate Emissions From Catalyst Cars. Morton Beltzer, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. A program to measure and characterize exhaust parti- culate emissions from a vehicle equipped with prototype catalyst systems was carried out. Nine catalysts (four monolithic oxidation catalysts, three pelleted oxidation catalysts, and two NOx reduction catalysts) were screened on three test fuels. The oxidation catalysts were repre- sentative of those used on 1975 production vehicles; the NOx reduction catalysts, candidates for use in future automotive emission control systems. The NOx catalysts were tested without oxidation catalysts in order to determine their contribution to particulate emissions. The fuels variables studied were additive, sulfur, and aromatic levels. Particulate emission rates and size distributions were measured for each catalyst/fuel combination. Anal- yses for sulfate, carbon, bound water, nine metals, organic nitrogen compounds, and organic sulfur compounds were also carried out. Sulfuric acid aerosol was produced along with in- creased quantities of metal containing particulates, espe- cially of iron and zinc, when the vehicle was equipped with an oxidation catalyst. The mass median equivalent diameter of oxidation catalyst exhaust particulate de- creased relative to the non-catalyst or NOx reduction catalyst cases, because sulfuric acid was the predominant component. The particle size distribution from a NOx reduction catalyst-equipped vehicle was similar to that of an unequipped vehicle. No nitrogen or sulfur-containing organic particulate matter was found. 1976 SA E Transactions 760039. Particulate Matter Associated with Vehicles on the Road. William R. Pierson and Wanda W. Brachaczek, Ford Motor Co. We have conducted a study to characterize the airborne and settleable particulate matter generated by vehicles on the road, to evaluate the importance of non-exhaust airborne material from vehicles, and to identify the vehicle types producing various airborne particulate species. Two tunnels ~ the Allegheny Tunnel of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Detroit &amp; Canada Tunnel - were utilized to isolate the motor vehicle from other sources of particulate matter. Experiments also were performed at sites in the open. The most important conclusions are: (1) Settleable material predominates in the particulate matter associated with traffic; at Allegheny it outweighed the airborne material by nearly two orders of magnitude. It originates mostly from sources other than engine exhausts. (2) Diesel-engine exhaust is the dominant source of airborne particulate matter associated with traffic, with emission rates col g/mi, at Allegheny where the average speed is &lt;*&gt; 50 mi/hr and Diesel trucks comprised 10% of the traffic. (3) Carbon is the most abundant element in the airborne particulate matter from traffic; it comes prima- rily from trucks, and much of it is present in the form of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. (4) Airborne particulate matter from traffic has a large surface area - up to 30 m2/g, or as high as 90 m2/g after removal of extractable organic material. (5) Airborne particulate matter generated by auto- mobiles at 50 mi/hr is &lt;0.1 g/mi, mostly from the exhaust. At least 20% of this (in 1971) was Pb, of which automobiles are the primary source. The Pb g/mi emission rate exhibits a decline during the 1971-1974 period, in keeping with the trend in gasoline Pb levels. Total Pb emissions at 50 mi/hr represent only about half of the Pb consumed. More than half of the Pb emitted is settleable, with a size range centered around several hundred jam. Conclusions regarding Br/Pb ratios, Zn, Ba, sulfate, and particle size of the airborne and settled material and certain chemical components are presented. 1976 SA E Transactions 760041. Size Characterization of Sulfuric Acid Aerosol Emissions. David F. Miller, David A. Trayser and Darrell W. Joseph, Battelle's Columbus Laboratories. In the course of a vehicle dynamometer study of sulfur emissions from an automobile equipped with oxidation catalysts, aerosol size distribution measurements were made while the exhaust was rapidly mixed with 10 parts of filtered air in a dilution tube. Results obtained with an electrical aerosol analyzer show that, under these dilution conditions, the sulfuric acid aerosols are consistently smaller than 0.3 jam in diameter. The distribution of aerosol volume (or mass) is slightly bimodal with maxima near 0.03 and 0.09 jam particle diameters. When a light-scattering effect is computed from theory using the observed particle size distributions good agreement is obtained between theory and measured light scattering. Within a reasonable margin of error, consistency is found between cascade impactor data, nephelometer light- scattering data, electrical analyzer data, and chemical analyses for sulfate. 760042. A Comprehensive Method for Wheel Testing by Stress Analysis. George Krause and Fritz Mahnig, George Fischer Ltd. (Switzerland). A comprehensive wheel testing method is being described which permits reliable service life estimation and, at the same time, gives valuable information for optimum wheel design. Key operation is the comparison of data disclosed by stress analysis with the physical properties of the material. Stress analysis is done on a new type slow-rolling test bench under simulated service loads. The scatter range of the stress is evaluated by calculations of probability. The fatigue strength of the material is determined by fatigue tests applying simulated service load programs on specially developed test specimens. When comparing the stress analysis data with the 21</page><page sequence="9">760043-760048 fatigue properties of the material a so - called "stress efficiency factor" is introduced. Whereas the testing method is shown for truck spoke wheel assemblies and components it can also be applied to other types of wheels. 760043. Performance Assessment Techniques for Com- mercial Vehicle Wheels. J. D. Mabon, E. Williams and D. B. Woodcock, GKN Sankey Ltd. (United Kingdom). This paper describes the testing and evaluation techniques used in assessing the suitability of a commercial vehicle wheel for its prescribed duty. It discusses some of the difficulties of legislative tests and suggests other desirable test features which are neglected in current proposals. 760044. Testing of Wheels. Albrecht Lüders, Kronprinz AG, Solingen (West Germany). Wheels for motor vehicles, being manufactured in serial production, belong to the category of the safety listed parts according to motor vehicle safety regulations. When testing wheels, the possibility of important differences from system point to system point must be realized. Because there is no one suitable test for all system points of a wheel, it is necessary to apply diverse methods of testing for new prototypes as well as for serial production. It is the purpose of this paper to examine the different methods of testing applied. 760045. Concise Description of Auto Fuel Economy and Performance in Recent Model Years. A. C. Malliaris, H. Hsia and H. Gould, U. S. Dept. of Transportation. The subject is treated by statistical and engineering analyses applied to extensive measurements of fuel economy and acceleration performance. Fuel economy data are provided by the EPA certification lists for the four years 1973 to 1976. The performance data are track measurements of 0 to 60 MPH acceleration times for 1974 and 1975 vehicles, as reported in the popular automotive literature. Several relations, supported by engineering analyses, are selected for making least-squares fits to the extensive measurements. The pivotal variables include: inertia weight, horsepower, engine displacement and rear axle ratio, individually and in combinations. Satisfactory fits are made by power factorial forms and the resulting algorithms have standard errors of estimate in the vicinity of 10% for fuel economy and in the range 10% to 15% for acceleration time. Basically similar power factorial forms fit equally well various data subsets obtained by model year, by driving schedule, by auto vs. truck, by Federal vs. California certification, by automatic vs. manual trans- mission, etc. The results are extensively discussed and interpreted, and sufficient comparisons are made with results from other statistical and engineering analyses. 760046. Effect of Emission Constraints on Optimum Engine Size and Fuel Economy. Roy C. Nichol- son and George W. Niepoth, GM Engineering Staff. A matrix of cars at three different inertia weights and various displacements were tailored to determine the optimum engine size for best fuel economy within emission and driveability constraints. Two emission standards were considered: 1.5 HC/15 CO/2.0 NOx and .41 HC/3.4 CO/2.0 NOx. The engine size for best fuel economy varied with vehicle inertia weight and emission standard. 760047. Credibility of Diesel Over Gasoline Fuel Econ- omy Claims by Association. W. J. Schultz, C. E. Miesiak, A. E. Hamilton and D. E. Larkinson, Perkins Engines Inc. Current and proposed legislation regarding gaseous emissions has adversely affected the fuel economy of certain gasoline engines. Recent economic and envi- ronmental developments such as the fossil fuel shortage have improved the potential for the use of diesel engines as the power plant for small commercial vehicles and possibly certain passenger cars. Many variables affect fuel economy comparisons. Most of these variables can be associated with either the vehicle design or operation. The objectives of this paper are to relate fuel economy claims with a variety of cycles and to show how some of these claims can be justified. Also, to show how some of the more impressive diesel over gasoline economy claims relate more to the real world than comparisons based on EPA and SAE cycles. EPA originally started with one cycle and later split it into city and highway driving, to better cover the real world. SAE now has three cycles which represent a broader range of habits and requirements. There is still room for improvements at the low speed, short trip in cold weather, end of the scale. Also, the high volume of small Commercial vehicles such as Pick-Ups, Vans, Taxis, etc. need attention. To appreciate the significance of comparing the real world to SAE cycles, we must be familiar with "typical vehicle fuel economy as influenced by trip length" (1), "fuel savings potentials in short trip cold weather service" (2), and "other published statistics" (3) that have SAE level research and credibility. These papers show the results of surveys describing how up to 80% of trips and 50% of the auto fuel consumed are associated with trips of 10 miles or less. 760048. Gasoline Consumption in Urban Traffic. Leo- nard Evans, Robert Herman and Tenny N. Lam, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Fuel consumption and dynamical variable data have been collected as a car was driven normally with low speed urban traffic. It has been shown, using regression analysis, that the single traffic variable of the 16 studied that can best explain fuel consumption per unit distance is the average trip time per unit distance. The regression results 22</page><page sequence="10">760049 - 760053 are similar for each of four different methods of sampling the speed-time history of the vehicle in traffic. Such fuel consumption data may therefore be collected by the method which is operationally most convenient. The variable, average trip time per unit distance, explained more than 71% of the variance in fuel consumed per unit distance in these experiments. An interpretation of this result is given in terms of engine-vehicle dynamics and the characteristics of urban traffic. The analysis of the data for each of four different drivers showed that the fuel consumed per unit distance was determined mainly by the average trip time per unit distance, essentially inde- pendent of the individual driver. 760049. The Changing Perspectives of Human Factor Applications to Automotive Design. Max H. Alexander and Ruth E. DeWald, U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Development Center. Using the systems approach, the human factors engineer stands ready to assist the design engineer in providing the vehicle driver with an optimum workplace. A human factors checklist has been devised for the design engineer to alert him to the major areas where troubles for the human operator generally develop. This preliminary checklist has been applied to the design of a pickup truck cab to illustrate its use. The terms "average" and "percentile" are explained. Sources of human factors data are suggested where the design engineer may find specific information as to spatial requirements for U.S. adult men and women, automotive driver controls, driver seating, environmental consider- ations within the vehicle, including conditions of heat, cold, and high humidity, ventilation, noise, vibration, and vision capability. When a particular component or control is the subject of a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, the pertinent standard is identified by number and title. Maintenance and maintainability considerations are emphasized, since all products must be repaired even- tually. The combination of good human factors engineering and vehicles that are easy to repair can greatly improve public acceptance of the automotive design engineer's product. 1976 SA E Transactions 760050. Fatigue in Automobile Drivers Due to Long Time Driving. Kazuyoshi Yajima, Kenji Ikeda and Masamitsu Oshima, Institute of Medical Elec- tronics, University of Tokyo (Japan); and Tokio Sugi, Isuzu Motors, Ltd. (Japan). Physiological and psychological responses due to 10 hours day driving and 24 hours driving were gathered from passenger car drivers in order to study driver's fatigue. These responses were classified into three groups. It was made clear that functions of central nervous system was the most important for driving among other functions. Biological rhythm was closely concerned to the reserve power of driving performance. 1976 SA E Transactions 760051. A VCR 1360-2 High Specific Output-Variable Compression Ratio Diesel Engine. J. R. Grundy, L. R. Kiley and E. A. Brevick, TELEDYNE CONTINENTAL MOTORS General Products Division. This paper addresses the development of the Teledyne Continental Motors' (TCM) AVCR 1360-2 variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine. This is the culmination of fifteen years of VCR piston and high specific output research. The unique configuration and resulting performance of this 335 BMEP engine are presented. The special features of the engine design which were refined during the AVCR 1360-2 development phase are discussed. Those features accentuated are the VCR piston system, the X-pump fuel injection system and the high pressure ratio induction system. Programs for development of satisfactory steady state and transient performance and the design modifications necessary to reduce the peak transient smoke burst to acceptable levels are described. 760052. The Perkins 6.247-The High Speed, High Econ- omy Diesel Engine for North American Light Duty Applications. D. E. Larkinson, R. J. Neal and W. J. Schultz, Perkins Engines Co. Differing emphasis in automotive technology has pro- voked interest in the use of diesel as opposed to gasoline engines, especially in the light duty vehicle sector. The Perkins 6.247 diesel engine has been adapted specifically for this sector; this paper discusses the 6.247 engine design and justifies its consideration as an alternative to the current predominant gasoline engines. 760053. XMC™ and HMC™-Structural Molding Com- pounds. Richard H. Ackley, Fiber Glass Div., PPG Industries, Inc. XMC™ and HMC™ are two families of fiber glass reinforced molding sheets that can be processed into structural shapes through the use of heated matched metal dies and hydraulic presses. The need to remove weight from power driven vehicles has increased in direct proportion to the world-wide energy shortage, and in light of this XMC™ and HMC™ were designed to compete with high density, high strength metals commonly used in structural parts for the transportation industry. XMC™ and HMC™ are distinguished from other molding compounds by their very high percentage of fiber glass (up to 80% by weight) which is incorporated into thickenable, thermosetting resin systems. XMC™ utilizes filament winding techniques and programmed winding angles to incorporate continuous strands of fiber glass. Upon completion of the filament winding process, the XMC™ is removed from the mandrel as a directionally reinforced sheet of uncured composite and its maturation 23</page><page sequence="11">760056 - 760067 process is allowed to continue before molding. H MC™ utilizes chop glass strands and is produced by the same processing methods as are used in the manufacture of SMC. The development of XMC™ and HMC™ as unique, high strength molding materials offers the automotive manufacturers a much needed capability to remove weight from the American automobile. XMC™ is expected to be used in such applications as door beams, transmission supports, and structural back-ups for bumpers while potential applications for HMC™ are radiator supports, hood inners, catwalks, and wheels. In addition to 50-60% weight reductions the consumer will also receive the superior corrosion resistance of these high strength compounds. Their ability to be shaped into high per- formance parts of complex configuration and non- uniform thickness gives the engineer new latitude in structural design. 760056. Manufacturing Processes for Aluminum-Steel Hoods. John L. Abernathy, Oldsmobile Div., General Motors Corp. The ever increasing need for improved automobile fuel economy led to the eventual use of light weight materials such as aluminum among other things. This paper discusses techniques and problems of assembling alu- minum and steel sheet metal stampings into Hood Assemblies. This paper does not attempt laboratory type research in fastening methods, such as spot welding, but discusses the application of these techniques from a Fabrication Plant point of view. In particular, this paper will discuss two hoods and their respective assembly processes. First, a low volume (30,000 units/yr.) bimetalic hood used on a 1975-76 "E" body, and second, a high volume all aluminum/all steel hood for a standard sized car. 760057. Automotive Sheet Metal Component Conversion From Steel to Aluminum. B. E. Bartell, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. A manufacturing study has been conducted to determine the feasibility of direct substitution of aluminum sheet for steel in automotive sheet metal applications. Manufac- turing considerations, strength-weight relationships and design parameters have been analyzed and the conclusion reached that aluminum panels can be manufactured on a production basis but the use of aluminum for a show surface panel made on tools built for steel with a gage for gage substitution of material is not recommended at this time because of inherent manufacturing penalties. 1976 SA E Transactions 760058. The Role of Projects in a Mechanical Engineering Design Curriculum. John F. Stephens, College of Engineering, University of South Carolina. The inclusion of required projects having specific char- acteristics into an engineering curriculum has been found to be of significant help in increasing the industrial readiness of the engineering student. Projects, whose goal it is to teach a balanced concept of design expose the student to the effects of manufactureability, time con- straints, and material constraints on basic product design and cost. It has been found that if several student groups are assigned the same project and put in a competitive situation, further incentive is produced in addition to the students learning to work together, to compromise their thoughts, and finally, to become of one mind in accom- plishing their project goal. 760059. Vehicle Crash Barrier Design. J. A. MacDonald, University of Western Ontario (Canada). Advanced technology is pushing the power capabilities of racing cars to the point where the lives of the drivers could be terminated in a split second. Some of the hazards are due to inadequate barriers; caused by sudden impact and by deflections over or under the barrier. This is also dangerous for the thousands of spectators who crowd the track for a better view. By request of the Motor Racing Safety Society, engineering students from over fifty universities took part in a Roadside Barrier Design Contest, resulting in many imaginative and innovative concepts. The engineering students from the University of Guelph were judged the overall winners. This paper is based primarily on their submission. 760060. Viking II - Experimental Research Vehicle. Jerry L. Burwell, Western Washington State College. An experimental light weight economy vehicle was designed and built by Western Washington State College. The car was designed as a two passenger, mid-engine, rear drive sports type vehicle. The body design and chassis layout were developed through wind tunnel testing to minimize drag. This resulted in a unique shape and extreme crabtrack layout. The body was constructed of fiberglass reinforced fire retardant polyester resin with urethane bumpers. The chassis was a combination of an epoxy faced aluminum honeycomb monocoque front section and a space tube frame rear section. The vehicle, which was powered by a four cylinder, four cycle Subaru converted to propane, had independent suspension front and rear. The vehicle attained 58.18 MPG (24.5 Km/L) on the 1975 S.E.E.D. Rally. 760063. Real World Relevance of Bumper Standards. Michael R. Appleby and Louis J. Bintz, Au- tomobile Club of Southern California. Bumper standards are examined for real world relevance by performing a literature review and comparing labo- ratory type test data with actual collision data. Conflicting or lack of data precluded reaching a conclusion that bumper standards result in safety benefits for pedestrians and vehicle occupants. Vehicle damage data are also examined and similar conclusions are made. 760067. The Licon Wheel Velocity Sensor - An Appli- cation of Ferrite Core Technology. Edward F. 24</page><page sequence="12">760069 - 760076 Sidor and Rand J. Eikelberger, Licon Div., Illinois Tool Works, Inc. A new wheel velocity sensor is described. The sensor represents another application of the ferrite core/magnet technology which has been used for several years in non-contacting keyswitches and keyboards. The wheel velocity sensor is an active, proximity sensor developed to be used with a variety of exciter rings and tone wheels in anti-skid systems, or as a tachometer sensor, a crankshaft position sensor, or in similar appli- cations where the speed of a rotating vane is to be monitored. The sensor provides an output signal with amplitude independent of the rotation rate of the vane, down to "zero speed". One version of the sensor consists of two ferrite toroidal core inductors connected in series with a fixed ceramic permanent magnet providing a magnetizing bias for the ferrite cores. It is a three terminal device and is commonly driven from a balanced signal source. The excitation frequency is not critical, and is usually in the 250 KHz to 1 MHz range. The sensor can be remotely located from its drive and signal processing unit. The maximum operating temperature of the sensor, which is determined by the Curie temperature of the ferrite cores, is over 180°C. Exposing the sensor to higher temperatures causes no permanent damage, as the temperature effects are reversible. The sensor operates with standard exciter rings at air gaps exceeding 0.100". An integrated circuit has been developed to interface the sensor with standard pulse counting circuits. The development of the sensor is discussed, and the performance characteristics of the sensor and the interface integrated circuit are described. 760069. An Analog/Digital Integrated Circuit Interface for Automotive Sensors. Paul R. Rabe, Eugene Greenstein and John W. Hile, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A unique and very versatile circuit is described which converts changes in physical parameters such as capac- itance, resistance, and inductance into a proportional pulse width modulated digital signal. This circuit, in combination with sensors which utilize these physical parameters in their operation, can be used to provide digital inputs to microprocessors and other digital control and diagnostic systems. Advantages of this particular circuit are its potential for high reliability, accuracy, and low cost. Several applications are described and an integrated circuit version of the circuit is discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760070. An Opto-Electronic Torquemeter for Engine Control. G. W. Pratt, Jr., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An optical means of measuring torque is described having high accuracy and reliability combined with modest cost. Details of an instrument which was adapted to a transmission output shaft are given. Torque, rpm, and their time rates of change are envisaged as inputs to a microprocessor for the generation of feedback control signals for timing, fuel-air ratio, and fuel. 760071. The Copper Electric Town Car. Michael Poco- bello and Dan Armstrong, Triad Services, Inc. Another step in the development of electric vehicles has been completed by the Copper Development Association Inc. with the construction of a two-passenger, electri- cally-powered automobile. This paper describes the engineering and development of this vehicle, which was designed from the ground up to be electrically powered. 760073. High Performance Electric Commercial Vehicles For City Use. G. G. Harding, Joseph Lucas Ltd. (United Kingdom). Lucas Industries Limited commissioned work on electric vehicles some seven years ago in order to provide test beds for batteries which were under development. During the past three years the battery development work has been concentrated on lightweight lead acid batteries and work on the vehicles themselves has been stepped up. A comprehensive electric vehicle development pro- gramme is now being undertaken. During the last 18 months this has led to the production of fifteen 1 tonne payload vans, a personnel carrier, a 34-passenger city bus and two city taxis. All these vehicles will be used by operators in service for extended periods in order that they can be evaluated from operational, engineering and financial points of view. 760074. Analysis of On-Road Electric Vehicle Experience of 62 U.S. Utilities. Edward A. Campbell, Electric Vehicle Council. A program was initiated by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) to develop a battery-powered van for use in short-range, multi-stop work missions by electric power companies. One hundred seven of these vehicles were produced in 1974 and sold to 62 power companies throughout the United States and Canada. An on-going study of performance and other parameters has been conducted by EVC, with the cooperation of the users. The program and the resulting vehicle are described as well as the results of the data gathering and evaluation program which has been conducted by the Council. 760076. Abrasion Resistant Acrylic Glazing. Richard A. Fleming and Paul D. Carfagna, E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. Plastics have an important niche in glazing applications where there is concern over vandalism and breakage, maintenance and repair, weight and design, and rolled up costs over the life of the article. Glazing undergoes attack by impinging solids, liquids, gases and radiation. Tests are presented which are useful in evaluating resistance of plastics to attack, both initially and after weathering. The development history of a new resistant coating for poly(methyl methacrylate) is sketched, and complete 25</page><page sequence="13">760078-760082 performance data are included. Coated acrylic offers an unusually good balance of properties for transportation and architectural uses. 1976 SA E Transactions 760078. The Female in Equipment Design. Monica M. Glumm, U. S. Army Human Engineering Lab- oratory. The influence of women on equipment design is well reflected in current Army efforts to accommodate the female soldier in her ever expanding role. Women have been admitted into all military occupational specialties, formerly considered "non-traditional", with the exception of combat related areas. The growing presence of women in the Army and their projected utilization have not been sufficiently addressed. Recent Army requirements, how- ever, emphasize that the enlisted female must now be equally considered in every respect in all Army material design including combat equipment. This paper discusses the need for up-to-date infor- mation concerning the capabilities and limitations of the female to determine the compatibility of existing materiel and that currently under development or anticipated. A number of design considerations relative to the findings of recent studies and surveys are included. Although em- phasis is placed on Army materiel those determining factors of equipment design are applicable to all areas where women are employed or where their participation is foreseen. 760080. Psychophysical Based Models for the Prediction of Lifting Capacity of the Industrial Worker. M. M. Ayoub, Texas Tech University; R. D. Dry den, University of Texas at Arlington; and R. E. Knipfer, U. S. Air Force. As science and technology become more sophisticated and with the rapid computation capabilities of the modern computer available, it becomes both possible and eco- nomically feasible to scientifically study man and his interaction with his working environment. It is now possible for a person seeking employment to expect and obtain a position which will not be unnecessarily haz- ardous to his immediate health or have detrimental effects over the long run. Manual materials handling is the contributor of over 400,000 back injuries suffered in the U. S. each year. This research is directed at determining the appropriate operator variables to measure for predicting the permis- sible weight of lift for 3 ranges of lift, floor to knuckle height, knuckle height to shoulder height, and shoulder height to reach height. A modified psychophysical procedure was used during which the subjects were instructed to adjust the weight in a tote box to the maximum weight they could lift repetitively without excessive strain or fatigue. The lifting exercise consisted of two 20-minute periods. Ninety-five of the 135 used subjects for the experiment were provided by industries and consisted of individuals, both male and female, whose daily activity involved the manual lifting of weights. The remaining subjects were students who were used in floor to knuckle height lifting range. Based on the data obtained, the lifting capacity of the worker was determined for the different ranges of lift. In addition, predictive models were developed based on the operator variables measured. 1976 SA E Transactions 760081. Variation of Driver's Arousal Level During Car Driving in Japan. Yasuyuki Kuroki, Tsutomu Aso, Hayao Hori and Masanori Matsuno, Japan Automobile Res. Inst., Inc. (Japan). The 104,635 cases of rearward collisions that occurred in 1974 accounted for 21% of all traffic accidents, the largest single category of accidents. It is thought that many of these accidents were caused by insufficient driver alert- ness due to a drop in the level of awareness or responsiveness. Using 18 male subjects, aged from 22 to 29, we conducted a test of reduction in the level of consciousness as determined by continuous measurements during nor- mal driving of EEG, ECG and EOG. Six of the subjects showed a drop in consciousness as indicated by the appearance of an alpha (a) wave of 8-13 Hz. Such waves appeared most frequently following the noontime meal. It can be postulated that their origin is a temporary state of psychological relaxation produced by a number of factors including mental fatigue, drop in the will to drive caused by phenomena of familiarity and daily bodily rhythms. It can be concluded that drivers must pay special attention to preventing the buildup of fatigue; at the same time, particular care must be taken after ingestion of meals. 760082. Bus Design for the Elderly and the Handicapped. Thomas L. Black, Rohr Industries, Inc.; and James A. Mateyka, Booz, Allen Applied Re- search. Concern for the accommodation of the elderly and handicapped in all public facilities has in the past decade become a new design challenge for architects and engineers. In the past five years, based in part upon legislative actions at the Federal and state levels, consid- erable research and development activities have been initiated related to this problem in mass transportation. This paper focuses on the design problems associated with accommodating the ambulatory elderly and handicapped as well as individuals in a wheelchair on full-size urban transit buses. The results of research activities during the development, testing, and public demonstrations of advanced prototype transit buses is presented. The focus of the paper is on the technical feasibility of bus design features and does not deal with operational or economic questions related to transportation of the handicapped. While the research conducted was supported by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), the discussions in this report do not reflect UMTA policy in this area. 1976 SA E Transactions 26</page><page sequence="14">760083 - 760091 760083. The Tire Valve-An Important Component of Wheel Systems. Frank S. Irlinger, Schräder Automotive Products Div., Scovili Manufactur- ing Co. Every pneumatic tire needs a means for inflating, deflating, and gauging. The tire valve serves this purpose well if its functional characteristics match those of any given application. This paper highlights essential valve basics, briefly indicates the different characteristics of passenger and truck valves, and suggests minimum guidelines for proper valve selection. Ever increasing tire sizes and operating costs demand faster inflation and deflation times. The new super large bore valves for off-highway vehicles meet these require- ments. An understanding of the valve's interrelationship with the rim, wheel and tire assembly will enable the designer to apply the safest and most cost effective valve. 760084. Cast Aluminum Wheels for OEM Passenger Car Applications. A. L. Lapsys, Ford Motor Co. Aluminum alloy wheels offer a relatively inexpensive means of differentiating between car models. As a result, their use on Ford vehicles has expanded in the past three years. Because experience has demonstrated their relia- bility, 6061 aluminum forgings were chosen as the desirable approach in the beginning of the aluminum wheel program. Design flexibility, however, was not available in forgings at reasonable cost. Basic work was done in developing high-elongation, high yield and ultimate tensile strength castings that would perform as well or better than forgings. The results of a two-year program have met the original objectives, allowing expanded use of the high-elongation cast wheels on all car lines. 760085. Finite Element Stress Analysis of Automotive Wheels. R. A. Ridha, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A method is shown for the analysis of stresses in automobile wheels. The structure is represented by a set of interconnected elements of finite size. The stresses calculated within each element describe the stress distri- bution in the cross-section and indicate how an optimum distribution of material may be determined. Formulation of the stiffness matrix of a constant strain triangular element for axisymmetric problems is given, together with the needed modifications for nonaxisymmetric loadings and anisotropic material properties. Illustrative examples show the stress distribution in a 13-inch rim caused by inflating a radial tire that is mounted on it. The examples also show the effects of varying the rim width on the contact pressures at the tire-rim interface and on the maximum principal stress in the wheel. 1976 SA E Transactions 760086. Low Energy Curing Adhesives-Their Uses, Ad- vantages, and Limitations. Gerald L. Schne- berger, General Motors Institute. This paper reviews the advantages and limitations of the low energy curing adhesives available today. They are classified according to use, cost, processing ease and performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of the basic principles of good adhesive joint design. 760090. The Kinetics of S02 Oxidation for Various Catalyst Compositions. R. H. Hammerle and T. J. Truex, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. The sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide conversion has been measured for three different automotive exhaust catalysts. Two of the catalysts were 1975 production catalysts (Engelhard IIB and Matthey-Bishop 3C) and the third is a palladium catalyst on a monolith support. The carbon monoxide and propylene conversions were also measured so that the activity of the three catalysts for these gases could be compared to their sulfur dioxide activity. The measurements were made using a flow reactor with simulated exhaust gas and show that, while the carbon monoxide and propylene conversions were very similar for all three catalysts, there was a wide range of sulfur dioxide conversions. At 525°C and 73,000 hr1 space velocity the sulfur dioxide conversion was 70% for the Engelhard IIB, 40% for the Matthey-Bishop 3C and from 25 to 70% for the palladium catalyst. The palladium catalyst has a range of conversions under these conditions which are asso- ciated with different states of the catalyst. It is not clear which state prevails in an automobile exhaust system. 760091. Critical Factors Affecting Automotive Sulfate Emissions. B. Krause, R. A. Bouffard, T. Karmilovich and E. L. Kayle, Exxon Research and Engineering Company. Two recently completed experimental programs provide data on four critical factors affecting automotive sulfate emissions: catalyst selectivity, catalyst age, driving mode, and gasoline sulfur level. A fifth factor, excess 02 level is discussed, but was not studied experimentally. In the first program, 20 1975 California model cars each accumulated 80 000 km on fuel containing 300 ppm sulfur. The cars used three different catalyst systems and were tested under four different test conditions: Federal Test Procedure (FTP), the Fuel Economy Test (FET), the Sulfate Emission Test (SET), and 80 km/h cruise. The results showed that S04" emissions from one of the systems were about three times higher than S04" emis- sions from the other two systems. S04" emissions from all systems reached a peak within the first 10 000 km of the test and declined thereafter. Averaged over the 80 000 km of the test, FTP S04" emissions from all 20 cars were half the peak value measured at 6 400 km and half EPA's previous estimate for S04" emission from these types of vehicles. Data obtained on the SET cycle indicate that EPA's recent estimate of 20 mg S04"/km for catalyst cars with air pumps operating on 300 ppm sulfur gasoline may 27</page><page sequence="15">760093 -760100 also be high. Finally, S04" emissions as a function of driving cycle were found to be: FTP &lt; 80 km/h cruise &lt; SET &lt; FET. In the second program, four catalyst systems were tested on fuels containing 24 to 469 ppm sulfur using SET, 64 km/h cruise, and FTP test conditions. Under all test conditions, S04" emissions were found to be a linear function of gasoline sulfur content, though in some cases, S04" emission differences between catalyst systems were larger than the effect of changes in fuel sulfur content for a given catalyst system. S04" emissions as a function of catalyst system type were found to be: Pt-Rh monoliths &lt; Pt-Pd pellets &lt; Pt-Pd monoliths &lt; Pt monolith. S04" emissions as a function of driving cycle were found to be: FTP &lt; 64 km/h cruise &lt; SET. 1976 SA E Transactions 760093. Frequency Output Pressure Sensors Based on an Application of Surface Acoustic Wave Technol- ogy. T. M. Reeder and D. E. Cullen, United Technologies Research Center; and O. A. J. Sauder, Essex International, Inc. A new type of frequency output pressure sensor is described which utilizes a novel application of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) technology. Variations in SAW velocity over a miniature pressure dependent diaphragm are used to control the frequency of an electronic feedback oscillator. Prototype SAW pressure sensors have been built which provide a frequency output that varies almost linearly with applied pressure and is accurate to better than 0.2 percent of full scale. The high precision, digital compatibility, and mass producible integrated circuit form of these sensors makes them potentially very attractive for automotive applications. 760094.

Conaway, Huntington Alloys, Inc. NI-ROD FC 55 Cored Wire is a recently developed flux-cored wire specifically designed for automatic weld- ing of various grades of cast irons. With the product, high-quality joints can for the first time be achieved in cast irons at rapid production rates. The flux-cored wire presents designers with many opportunities to obtain substantial cost savings. The use of economical cast irons can now be expanded to include parts that previously had to be designed in forged or cast steel to gain the required weldability. This report presents a description of the new cored wire and describes several examples of its use in the automotive, farm machinery, and other industries. 760099. A Single-Cylinder Engine Study of Hydrogen- Rich Fuels. Fred B. Parks, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Hydrogen-rich fuels, via lean operating ability, potentially offer both emission control opportunities and engine efficiency gains not possible with gasoline. With a single-cylinder engine, the emission characteristics of two types of hydrogen-rich fuels were evaluated. The first fuel contained various proportions of hydro- gen and gasoline. The test objective was to determine whether increasing HEF, the fraction of total fuel energy supplied by hydrogen, would significantly reduce HC emission at ultra-lean conditions. While holding NOx emission comparable to a 0.4 g/mile equivalent, HC emission was reduced 50 percent by increasing HEF from 0.13 to 0.48. However, even with this maximum practical level of hydrogen enrichment, the resulting HC emission was not significantly different than values obtained with richer mixtures of gasoline and still far in excess of a 0.41 g/mile equivalent. Therefore, hydrogen enrichment does not appear to be a sufficient means of reducing HC emission. The second type of hydrogen-rich fuel was a simulated product of an on-vehicle hydrogen generator that reforms gasoline into a gaseous mixture of CO, H2, CH4, and various diluents. Fueling a single-cylinder engine totally on this mixture at an equivalence ratio = 0.55 resulted in NOx and HC emission levels well below those obtainable with gasoline and possibly consistent with the most stringent future vehicle standards. CO emission was slightly higher than values characteristic of lean operation with gasoline. Major drawbacks to this concept for reducing emissions are: 1) the requirement of precise mixture control, 2) the fuel economy penalties exacted for converting gasoline to hydrogen-rich mixtures, and 3) the power losses in naturally aspirated engines operating on gaseous fuels containing large diluent fractions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760100. Characteristics of a Four Cylinder Hydrogen- Fueled Internal Combustion Engine. Stanley R. Thomas, Jr., Lawrence Livermore Laboratory; and S. C. Sorenson, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois. The purpose of this paper is to review the results of an experimental test program conducted on a commercial four cylinder spark ignition internal combustion engine. Corrected brake horsepower, corrected brake mean 28</page><page sequence="16">760101-760109 effective pressure and enthalpy efficiency are presented covering equivalence ratios from .42 through .63 at M BT timing under full load (or equivalently, wide open throttle) conditions. In addition, advanced cam timing was studied as a means of improving control of the hydrogen combustion rate and found to be ineffective. MBT timing characteristics suggest a marked increase in flame speed at full load operation for engine speeds above 1500 rpm, which is independent of equivalence ratio and cam timing. 760101. Evaluation of the Hydrogen-Supplemented Fuel Concept with an Experimental Multicylinder Engine. J. Scott MacDonald, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Supplementing the gasoline-air intake mixture of an internal combustion engine with a hydrogen-rich fuel is one means of achieving very lean operation and low NOx levels that promise to meet the 0.4 g/mi standard. Steady-state engine dynamometer tests were conducted with a specially modified multicylinder engine to deter- mine if the improved lean operating ability of this engine would enhance the hydrogen-supplemented fuel ap- proach. For these tests the hydrogen enrichment was accomplished with both bottled hydrogen and simulated hydrogen-generator products. The hydrogen requirement of this engine was com- parable to that of a 1973 Chevrolet engine tested at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. Thus, the experimental engine did not benefit the hydrogen-supplemented fuel approach. At the lean mixtures required for very low NOx, the hot-engine hydrocarbon mass emission level was seven times the target for 1978 (0.41 g/mi) and approximately 60% greater than the minimum base-line level. The carbon monoxide mass emission level was approximately five times as great for supplementation with the simulated generator prod- ucts as for supplementation with bottled hydrogen, and double the target for the 1978 standard for 3.4 g/mi. 760103. Practical Economic Aspects of Tractor/Trailer Aerodynamics. Harleigh R. Holmes, Ryder Sys- tem, Inc. The consumption of diesel fuel by intercity tractor/trailer combinations can be reduced significantly by improving the aerodynamics of the tractor/trailer combination. Theoretical data developed in the University of Maryland Wind Tunnel with l/8th scale models is reconciled with actual vehicle tests conducted under closely controlled conditions. Reductions in fuel consumption offered by other features and devices are compared with the savings provided by aerodynamic features. 1976 SA E Transactions 760105. An Evaluation of the Aerodynamic Drag Reduc- tions Produced by Various Cab Roof Fairings and a Gap Seal on Tractor-Trailer Trucks. Colin H. Marks, Frank T. Buckley, Jr. and William H. Walston, Jr., Mechanical Engineering Dept., University of Maryland. A study has been carried out to determine the reduction in the aerodynamic drag of tractor-trailer trucks brought about by fairings mounted on the cab roof and a vertical seal mounted across the gap between the tractor and the trailer. This study was conducted using one-eighth-scale models in a wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of about 25 percent of that of full scale trucks at 50 mph. Reductions of up to 35 percent of the zero-yaw drag coefficient, and of over 25 percent of the wind-averaged drag coefficient were obtained. The drag reductions obtained with roof fairings, with and without gap seals, significantly exceeded those obtained with a commer- cially-available roof deflector, with and without a vortex stabilizing device. Comparison with other model tests and a full-scale test indicates that the results obtained in this study should be directly applicable to full-scale trucks. 1976 SA E Transactions 760106.

Procedures for conducting full-scale coast-down tests for the purpose of determining the aerodynamic drag forces on tractor- trailer trucks are presented. Tests were con- ducted on the baseline vehicle and on the baseline vehicle modified with drag reduction devices. Techniques for the evaluation of mechanical drag forces prior to the coast- down tests are given and a description of the instru- mentation is included. 1976 SA E Transactions 760109. On the Emission-Combustion Temperature Re- lationship in the CVCC Engine. Shizuo Yagi, Isao Fujii, Mori Watanabe and Shin Narasaka, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. In the CVCC engine, the air-fuel mixture formation in the auxiliary and main combustion chambers immediately prior to ignition is dependent on its geometrical and operating factors. Varying of such factors, as stated in SAE Papers (1) (2), leads to considerable changes in the engine's characteristics, namely, its fuel consumption and the exhaust emissions. In this paper, we have obtained the combustion gas pressure and temperature diagrams of both main and auxiliary combustion chambers of a 1.5 litre, 4 cylinder CVCC engine and analyzed the diagrams by using the Mixture Formation Model, in order to study the char- acteristics of the generation of the exhaust emissions. As a result we found that the pattern of the pressure and temperature diagrams vary according to the air-fuel mixture formation and that the generation of emissions is in fact governed by the maximum combustion gas pressure and temperature, but the general tendency can also be shown by the temperature-time area ratio. 29</page><page sequence="17">760110-760114 Even when indicated specific fuel consumption is maintained constant, variations in the geometrical and operating factors cause variations in temperature in the main combustion chamber and therefore similar varia- tions in the average exhaust gas temperature immediately down-stream of the exhaust valve, and affect the exhaust emission levels. 1976 SA E Transactions 760110. Peugeot - Renault - Volvo 90° V6 Engine (6 X 88 X 73 - 2.664 cm3). François Gastinne, Société Anonyme des Automobiles Peugeot; M. Laliere, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault; and Stephen Wallman, AB Volvo. This engine was developed in common by Peugeot, Renault and Volvo. It is being manufactured in France at the Franco-Swedish Engine Company plant at Douvrin. Displacement is 2.66 liters; the cylinder block and cylinder head are made of aluminum. The V is 90° open so the assembly is small and lightweight. This paper deals with the fundamental elements considered for the choice of the structure of the engine assembly, particularly the layout of the cylinders. A technical analysis is provided for the choice of: location of the camshaft, drive of the distribution, sizes of bearings, structure of bearing caps and block reinforcing ribs. The requirements to be met to insure the best balancing and the various alternatives available will be explained in detail. The designs incorporated to insure proper engine aspiration are explained, as well as designs adopted for fuel distribution and ignition of the cylinders. Particular attention is given to the selection of a fuel injection and emission control system to meet applicable regulations. The paper will also deal with the lubrication and cooling systems particular to this engine. 760111. A Low Vibration Engine with Unique Counter- Balance Shafts. Hirokazu Nakamura, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (Japan). Subcompact cars generally use 4-cylinder engines, because of their advantages over 6-cylinder or 8-cylinder engines in production cost, engine size, weight, combustion efficiency, emission control, etc. The 4-cylinder engine, however, has an inherent shortcoming of second order vibration in the vertical and rolling directions, originating from the reciprocating masses and explosions in the engine. A new in-line 4-cylinder engine with its vibration reduced to a level comparable to the 6-cylinder engine or rotary engine has been recently developed while retaining the advantages mentioned above. The engine incorporates a unique balancing system, which reduces the booming to a minimum in the vehicle passenger compartment. 1976 SA E Transactions 760112. Improved passenger car cooling systems. S. P. Hawes, Research and Development Airscrew Howden Limited. Power for engine cooling may be reduced by using the latest improvements in radiators and fans and by careful design of the air circuit. More effective cooling over the operational cycle is obtained by combining the efficient use of ram air with electric fans. 760113. A New Aluminum-Lead Bearing Material for Automotive Engine Service. M. L. MacKay, L. J. Cawley and G. R. Kingsbury, Gould, Inc. A new aluminum-lead bearing material and manufac- turing technology are described. Metallurgical process difficulties associated with the aluminum-lead alloy system are overcome by the use of powder metallurgy methods. Alloy powder atomizing, multilayer powder rolling and roll-cladding processes are combined into a commercially practical manufacturing system. Bearing test data show that the new material is superior to the standard SAE bimetal aluminum-base alloy in fatigue and wear resistance. Successful per- formance in automotive crank-shaft bearings is demon- strated in engine dynamometer and vehicle tests. 760114. Two-Phase, Two-Dimensional, Unsteady Com- bustion in Internal Combustion Engines; Pre- liminary Theoretical-Experimental Results. F. V. Bracco, H. C. Gupta, L. Krishnamurthy, D. A. Santavicca, R. L. Steinberger and V. Warshaw, Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences Depart- ment Princeton University. The goal of this theoretical-experimental work is to model two-dimensional, unsteady (and steady) two phase flow combustion in internal combustion engines (and steady reactors) and to test and improve the model with parallel experimental programs. The purpose of this research is to make more detailed current understanding of this impor- tant family of combustion problems and to aid the development of cleaner and more efficient engines. In this paper, preliminary theoretical-experimental results of our efforts toward the stated goal are presented. The theo- retical results are preliminary but prove the feasibility of detailed computations of combustion in internal com- bustion engines and show how informative such com- putations can be. In a section of this paper, preliminary results are reported of detailed computations of two-dimensional, unsteady sprays penetrating and vaporizing into an inert gas in a closed volume (without combustion). In a second section, preliminary results are given of detailed com- putations of an unsteady, two-dimensional fuel jet mixing and reacting with an oxidizer in the presence of an inert gas in a closed volume. In a third section, a closely controlled experimental program on a single cylinder reciprocating engine is described which is designed to yield detailed measurements of the calculated quantities. The above three topics are considered in the same paper for the following three reasons. All the theoretical results are intermediate steps toward the formulation and 30</page><page sequence="18">760116-760119 solution of a comprehensive model for two-phase, two- dimensional, unsteady, reactive turbulent flows. The experimental engine configurations have been purposely selected to match very closely those considered in the theoretical computations. These authors put great em- phasis on the need and usefulness of matching detailed theoretical and experimental studies of this family of complex combustion problems. 760116. A Performance Model for the Texaco Controlled Combustion, Stratified Charge Engine. B. C. Jain, J. M. Rife and J. C. Keck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A model has been developed to predict the performance of the Texaco Controlled Combustion, Stratified Charge Engine starting from engine geometry, fuel characteristics and the operating conditions. This performance model divides the engine cycle into the following phases: Intake, Compression, Rapid Combustion, Mixing-Dominated Expansion, Heat-Transfer Dominated Expansion and Exhaust. During the rapid combustion phase, the rate of heat release is assumed to be controlled by the rate of fuel injection and the air-to-fuel ratio. The burning rate in the mixing controlled stage appears to be dominated by the rate of entrainment of the surrounding gas by the plume of burning products and this rate is assumed to be controlled by the turbulent eddy entrainment velocity. A plume geometry model has been developed to obtain the surface area of the plume for entrainment during the mixing dominated phase. The model also gives the wall areas in contact with the hot, burned gas plume and the relatively cold unburned gas for heat transfer calculations. Comparison of the model predictions with the avail- able experimental data shows good agreement. In addi- tion, the potential of the performance model as a design tool is demonstrated with a parametric analysis. 760117. Effects of the Degree of Fuel Atomization on Single-Cylinder Engine Performance. William R. Matthes and Ralph N. McGill, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. An investigation has been made to determine the effects of the degree of fuel atomization on exhaust emissions, fuel consumption, lean limit, MBT spark timing, and cyclic variations in peak cylinder pressure. A single- cylinder engine was used to isolate the effects of atomization on combustion from the additional effects of maldistribution that would be present in a multicylinder engine. Three degrees of gasoline atomization were inves- tigated, along with the case of a well-mixed charge of gaseous propane. The degrees of atomization investigated varied from "Good" (10-20 ļim droplets) to "Bad" (400-700 /jtm droplets) to "Wall-Wetted" (400-700 jam droplets deposited on the intake-port walls). Results from this investigation show that the degree of atomization can have considerable effect on exhaust emissions, but little effect on fuel consumption. Generally, as atomization deteriorated, hydrocarbon emissions in- creased; nitric oxide and carbon monoxide emissions increased for certain air-fuel ratio ranges; MBT (Min- imum for Best Torque) spark advance decreased; lean limit was extended; and cyclic variations in peak cylinder pressure decreased. It was hypothesized that the case of Good atomization resulted in an essentially homogeneous charge of vaporr ized gasoline and air at the time of ignition, while the cases of Bad and Wall-Wetted atomization resulted in inhomogeneous charges; that is, some form of strati- fication of the fuel-air mixture existed. All of the results are discussed in light of this hypothesis and are shown to be consistent with it. Discussion: I. N. Bishop, Ford Motor Co. 1976 SA E Transactions 760118. The Future Role of Electric Land Transportation in The United States. Graham Hagey, Energy Research and Development Administration; and William Hamilton, General Research Corpora- tion. Electrification of land transportation, primarily auto- mobiles, will be important to conserve petroleum before the year 2000. Even with existing battery technology, electric cars would be adequate for significant urban use as second cars, and with advanced batteries they could do much more, bringing about large petroleum savings in cities relying on coal or nuclear electric power, plus modest improvement of air quality. Overall costs of auto operation would be increased, however, and availability of some battery materials is limited. 760119. A Study of the Energy Utilization of Gasoline and Battery-Electric Powered Special Purpose Vehi- cles. David C. Sheridan, John J. Bush and William R. Kuziak, Jr., Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The depletion of the supply of liquid hydrocarbon fuels in the predictable future has accelerated interest in vehicles powered by different forms of energy. The battery is one form of energy storage that has successfully found application in special-purpose vehicles for nearly three- quarters of a century. Heavy duty lift-trucks and tugs, golf carts and delivery vehicles are among the vehicle types powered by battery-electric systems. Personal transpor- tation needs have been served to only a limited extent by electric vehicles because of the low power, limited range and lack of durability provided by the conventional lead-acid battery. However, recent changes in the energy availability picture have necessitated reconsideration of the electric vehicle. In order to compare the efficiency of utilization of the Earth's fossil energy resources (petroleum and coal) by battery-electric and gasoline powered special-purpose urban vehicles, an analytic study was conducted. The guidelines of this study restricted it to three special- 31</page><page sequence="19">760120-760123 purpose cars that are smaller and have lower performance than conventional subcompact cars and a delivery van. The vehicle power train components represent demon- strated current technology. The most important guideline of the study required the performance levels and load carrying capacity of the gasoline and electric-powered vehicles to be the same. The results of the study indicate that a lead-acid battery powered, two-passenger shopper vehicle with a 40 km range consumed about 90% more petroleum per kilometer of driving than does its spark ignition engine powered counterpart. With coal as the prime source, they consume about the same amount of energy. Increases in desired range, performance and vehicle size beyond that of the shopper increase the electric vehicle energy consumption with respect to the gasoline powered version. The position of the electric vehicle is improved with respect to the gasoline vehicle by the development of advanced batteries, increased electric component effi- ciencies and an actual electric vehicle mass less than assumed due to a reduced mass compounding factor. An aspect related to the conventionally powered vehicle that tends to reduce the advantage over the electric is a potential efficiency penalty of the spark ignition engine due to its small size. Incorporation of these considerations into the study produce results more favorable for the electric version. 1976 SA E Transactions 760120. Energy Analysis and the Electric Car. K. R. Williams, Shell International Petroleum Co., Ltd. The energy which is necessary for both the construction and operation of a variety of cars is calculated and compared. It is concluded that the energy used in vehicle operation outweighs that used for construction. Battery- powered cars while showing no significant advantage in overall energy requirement over gasoline vehicles offer the possibility of substituting coal or nuclear energy for hydrocarbon fuels in vehicle propulsion. Ultimately a fuel cell vehicle could offer major energy savings. 760121. Hybrid Vehicle for Fuel Economy. L. E. Un- newehr, J. E. Auiler, L. R. Foote, D. F. Moyer and H. L. Stadler, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A heat engine/electric hybrid drive train is proposed as a means for improving CVS-Hot fuel economy by an estimated 30% to 100% in various types of automotive vehicles. This drive train, classified as a parallel hybrid, has been analyzed by means of computer simulation studies to evaluate its fuel economy, performance, and emissions characteristics, and has been compared with existing internal combustion engine drive trains and other types of hybrid drives. A prototype system has been assembled and evaluated on a dynamometer test stand and has corroborated the computer analysis and predic- tions. Problems and limitations of this system are discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760122. An Analytical Study of the Fuel Economy and Emissions of a Gas Turbine-Electric Hybrid Vehicle. Sidney G. Liddle, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A study was made to determine the effect of hybrid operation on the fuel economy and emissions of a vehicle using a gas turbine engine, a continuously variable transmission, and an electric power storage system. Both series and parallel hybrids were considered in a 1815 kg vehicle. To facilitate this study, a computer program was written which modeled the vehicle and, using experi- mental data, computed its fuel consumption and emis- sions over the 1972 FTP driving cycle, starting with a fully warmed up engine. This study indicates that, under certain conditions, the fuel consumption or emissions of the hybrid vehicle may be reduced as compared to its non-hybrid counterpart, but under other conditions, they may be increased. It is not possible to reduce fuel consumption and all of the emissions simultaneously. The reduction of one pollutant is usually accompanied by an increase in one of the others. The extent of the reduction or increase experienced with hybrid operation depends on the particular type of hybrid and on the engine operating conditions. The following table shows the relative effects of minimizing fuel consumption or any of the various pollutants. The table also shows which type of hybrid is best as well as the operating schedule and fuel control parameter. The fuel consumption and emissions are normalized with respect to the standard vehicle as defined in Assumption 8. This table indicates that the hybrid offers a small decrease in fuel consumption as compared to the standard car and at the expense of increased NOx emissions. Minimizing unburned hydrocarbons reduces fuel con- sumption but at the expense of increased NOx. Both fuel consumption and NOx emissions are increased when carbon monoxide is minimized. Very large increases in fuel consumption and in unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions result from minimizing oxides of nitrogen emissions. It must be concluded that the hybrid vehicle does not automatically guarantee lower fuel consumption or emis- sions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760123. An Experimental ICE/Battery-Electric Hybrid with Low Emissions and Low Fuel Consumption Capability. Victor Wouk, Petro-Electric Motors, Ltd. A "compound" parallel ICE/battery-electric hybrid au- tomobile has yielded emissions (gms/mi) less than 0.41 HC, 3.40 CO, and 1.0 NOx on the FDP when tested by the 32</page><page sequence="20">760124-760129 EPA. Fuel economy increased 50% on the FEC with partial battery depletion. The 4,100 lb. curb weight vehicle has a top speed over 70 mph, with 0-60 mph in 16 seconds. Low fuel consumption was not a goal in this vehicle. The requirement of 10 mpg was set in 1970 for the FCCIP. FE of 30 mpg or more is projected with known techniques for reducing fuel consumption. A small ICE and a dc dynamotor (generator/motor) on the same shaft drive the vehicle through a conventional clutch and gears. HC and CO are reduced by a thermal reactor. EGR reduces NOx. The ICE operates with a quasi-constant manifold vacuum. Analysis show that in commuter applications, fuel economy can be increased 60% with partial battery depletion, by hybridizing any conventional car. In a "second car" application, fuel economy can be increased 100% in comparison with conventional ICE vehicles of equal performance. 760124. A Purpose-Built Electric Taxi. P. Warner, David Ogle, Ltd. Lucas Industries awarded a contract to David Ogle Limited as part of their electric vehicle development programme to develop and build a purpose-built electric vehicle. This paper describes the design and development as well as the deciding factors which made the choice of vehicle a taxi rather than any other vehicle configuration. 760125. Future Fuel Injection System Requirements of Diesel Engines for Mobile Power. R. F. Parker, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The diesel engine appears destined to play a major role in the mobile power field, through the next decade. In order for this engine to fully realize its superior potential in this field, considerable development work is being conducted throughout the world to optimize each subsystem of the engine. Through this work, the need for a new generation fuel injection system has become apparent. This new system must be based on the latest tech- nology available to provide a cost-effective design with increased capability. It can then provide the flexibility necessary to maximize the thermal efficiency of the engine while minimizing to a socially acceptable level the gaseous emissions, black smoke, noise and odor-irritant emissions of the next generation of diesel engines. Much of the information presented here is based on experience obtained from engines equipped with research type fuel injection systems. It should be considered an interim report, but work to describe an advanced injection system must begin now, to hasten the date of production availability. It is the goal of this paper that these specifications serve as initial guidelines in the development of advanced fuel systems for the next generation diesel engines which are being designed to meet the demanding requirements of mobile power for the future. 1976 SA E Transactions 760126. The Role Of Fuel Injection Equipment in Reduc- ing 4-Stroke Diesel Engine Emissions. H. C. Grigg, CAV Ltd. A penetration is forecast of the diesel engine, in both direct and indirect form, into the medium and pick-up truck market in the United States and the light truck, van and car market in Europe. This penetration, together with the advent of legislation in the field of gaseous emissions, smoke and noise, and the energy crisis, leads to the need for changes in diesel fuel injection equipment. The paper considers the technical requirements that arise in terms of engine and fuel injection equipment performance. Some developments that are in hand at the author's company to satisfy those requirements are described. 1976 SA E Transactions 760127. New Robert Bosch Developments for Diesel Fuel Injection. Klaus D. Zimmermann, Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany). The diesel engine is in a phase of very intensive developments. Therefore the fuel injection system has to be adapted to the growing requirements of the engine. These efforts resulted at ROBERT BOSCH in new higher performance inline- and distributor type injection pumps. We also developed new nozzle versions and improved accessories for the well known proven governor line. In view of diesel injection equipment for the eighties we are involved in basic research and development work; the objectives will be outlined in this paper. 760128. A Transient Spray Mixing Model for Diesel Combustion. W. S. Chiù, S. M. Shahed and W. T. Lyn, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. A transient spray mixing model forming the basis of heterogeneous combustion in direct injection diesel engines is described. Experimental results of transient fuel sprays in a high pressure, high temperature chamber form the basis of spray growth equations. Use of similarity of concentration profile across the spray in conjunction with spray geometry and mass conservation yields a complete description of spatial and temporal fuel-air distribution. Fuel preparation and air entrainment rates are calculated from the history of fuel-air distribution. Progressive evolution of combustion zones is deter- mined by the fuel-air mixing process. Energy conservation and chemical kinetics calculations in each zone yield cylinder pressure and local nitric oxide concentration. The role of fuel-air mixing in diesel combustion is discussed. The model results are compared with exper- imental data. 1976 SA E Transactions 760129. Models for Combustion and Formation of Nitric Oxide and Soot in Direct Injection Diesel 33</page><page sequence="21">760130-760136 Engines. H. Hiroyasu and T. Kadota, University of Hiroshima. A mathematical model was developed for predicting the concentration of exhaust nitric oxide, soot and other emissions in a direct injection diesel engine. In the model, it was emphasized to describe the phenomena occurring in the combustion chamber from the microscopic point of view. The prediction was based on the knowledges concerning a single droplet as well as the droplet size distribution in a fuel spray and the spatial and temporal distribution histories of fuel in a combustion chamber. The heterogeneous field of temperature and equivalence ratio, and uniform pressure in the cylinder were postu- lated. The heat release model gives the burning rate of injected fuel and pressure and temperature history in the cylinder. The concentration of nitric oxide and soot in the cylinder was predicted by the emission formation model. In order to confirm the validity of the theoretical analysis, the calculated results were compared with the experi- mental results for typical direct injection diesel engine. 1976 SAE Transactions 760130. Fuel and Additive Effects on Diesel Particulate - Development and Demonstration of Method- ology. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. To develop a methodology for characterizing particulate emissions from diesel engines, one 2-stroke cycle engine and one 4-stroke cycle engine were operated in both individual steady-state modes and according to a variation of the 13-mode diesel emissions measurement procedure. Both engines were operated on three fuels, each used with one of two available diesel fuel additives as well as by itself. The primary particulate sampling technique employed was a dilution tunnel, and secondary evaluation tech- niques included a diluter-sampler developed under con- tract to EPA by another organization, a light extinction smokemeter, and a filter-type sampling smokemeter. Gaseous emissions were also measured, providing a running check on engine condition. Particulate mass rates were calculated from gravi- metric data; and analysis of particulate included deter- mination of sulfur, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phenols, nitrosamines, trace metals, and organic solubles. Analysis of the organic soluble fraction included NMR, IR, paraffin boiling point distribution, benz(a)pyrene, sulfur, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. The results of this study are the first of their type to be widely distributed, so it is imperative that the use of emissions values computed be treated with caution until other laboratories can confirm these findings. This caution is especially important for materials like nitrosamines and BaP, for which analysis is difficult and as yet not thoroughly documented in the literature as applied to emissions from diesels. Discussion: Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute. 1976 SA E Transactions 760131. The Measurement and Analysis of the Physical Character of Diesel Particulate Emissions. Carl T. Vuk, John Deere Product Engineering Cen- ter; Martin A. Jones and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological University. One of the more objectionable aspects of the use of the diesel engine is its emission of particulate matter. Methods for collecting particulate matter samples in the undiluted exhaust gases with an Andersen Impactor for gravimetric and electron microscopy analysis are developed. A direct injection Vee-eight naturally aspirated diesel engine was used in the study. This paper presents the results of an in-depth study of the physical characteristics of diesel particles. The size distribution of the particulate matter was obtained using an Andersen Inertial Impactor for the engine conditions applicable to the SAE 13-mode cycle. The particulate matter was analyzed using both scanning and transmission electron microscopes and was found to be comprised of individual spherical particles ranging from 100 Â to 800 À with a mean size of approximately 260 À. The particulate matter was analyzed for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. The solid particulate matter collected within the Andersen Sampler had a car- bon/hydrogen ratio that is temperature dependent rang- ing from .75 at an exhaust temperature of 100 C to approximately 5. at exhaust temperatures greater than 300 C. A correlation between the number of individual spherical particles in an agglomerate and the agglomerate size reveals a particle number range from a single, 100 À particle to an agglomerate 30 /im in diameter containing an average of 4000 of the individual spherical particles. 1976 SAE Transactions 760132.

With increasing fuel costs, the prospect of using alternative fuels increases dramat- ically. Large quantities of used lubricating oil are currently available and could be used in fuel blends for Diesel engines. The used lubricating oil-fuel oil ratios used in this study were 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15% used lubricating oil by volume. The effect of burning these blends on unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen is reported along with a comparison to baseline values for pure Diesel fuel. Tests were run at 1800, 2400 and 3000 rpm at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and full rack positions for each fuel blend. The general condition of wear in the engine along with deposit formation and analysis is reported. The effect of the used lubricating oil on thermal efficiency and BSFC is shown for the blends studied. 760136. Cold Extruded Parts Get Larger. G. E. Ferber, Braun Engineering Co. Cold extrusion technology has advanced and expanded 34</page><page sequence="22">760137-760143 over the past few years to a point where much larger, more dense and complex parts are being successfully produced by the millions. Innovations in blank preparation and new approaches to tooling have been highly instrumental in this breakthrough, which can solve many problems in our waste-conscious, energy-poor society. Key elements that have created the new and greatly enlarged potential for cold extrusion are discussed. Case histories of complex parts weighing up to 5-1/2 lbs. that have been converted from metal cutting to cold extrusion are fully documented with data on raw material and machining comparisons. 760137. Wedgerolling for Preforms and as a Substitute for Machining. Kenneth J. Belmont, Wedgeroll, Inc. Wedgerolling is a relatively new hot metal forming process that combines the techniques and advantages of forging, hot extruding, screw machining or chucking, into one automatic process for round bar, billets or heavy wall tube. Wedgerolling or transverse hot roll forming as we know it today was really perfected and put to actual production use in the late 1950's, originally in Czecho- slovakia. It is now used in Russia and in England. It offers both advantages and disadvantages over currently used metal shaping and metal removal processes. It reduces diameters of material, does not intentionally gather like cold heading. Depending upon the particular part appli- • cations, it can offer up to 400% in cost savings over popular processes now in production use. 760138. Spin Welding Component Design for Cost and Weight Savings. Lowell B. Brewer, Wes Dick and Bud Schubert, Spicer Axle Div., Dana Corp. This paper is an attempt to illustrate examples to generate creative thinking for parts designers in planning future designs to result in cost and weight savings by use of spin welding. It also covers representative examples of designs, which include the forces exerted on the part as it is being welded, both in torsional force and column strength. 760139. A Preliminary Materials Selection Guide. R. T. Wimber, Deere &amp; Co. A preliminary materials selection guide comprising a series of bar charts and an associated work sheet has been developed. The guide is intended to aid design engineers in the selection of general types of materials and is seen to function as a forerunner leading to other, more specific, selection guides. In addition to the conventional engineering properties represented in the bar charts, the following new cost and energy-consumption parameters were defined and repre- sented in bar-chart format: Relative Price, Volumetric Price, Price/Rigidity Ratio, Energy- Consumption/Strength Ratio and Volumetric Energy- Consumption. 1976 SA E Transactions 760140. Economy with Reduced Exhaust Emissions-A Simple Technique. D. W. Hughes and J. R. Goulburn, Ashby Institute, Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland). A technique is described for fully vaporising the fuel between the carburettor and inlet manifold of an auto- mobile engine. This permits very lean air-fuel mixtures to be burnt, with the effect of reducing both noxious exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. Laboratory and on- the-road tests are described, and results discussed. 760141. Emissions and Fuel Economy Test Methods and Procedures For Light Duty Motor Vehicles - A Critique. David Milks and Richard A. Matula, Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics Dept., Drexel University. The reliability and reproducibility of both exhaust emissions and fuel economy measurements for light duty motor vehicles are strongly influenced by the specified test methods and procedures. In this paper, the statistical variability of CVS-CH exhaust emission tests for light duty motor vehicles and the relative magnitudes of the various factors affecting errors encountered during the tests are discussed. Additional questions concerning the affect of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions and data relating to the effectiveness of present evaporative HC emission test methods and procedures are considered. In addition, the critical elements in any standardized fuel economy test method and procedure are discussed and data associated with the statistical variability of present fuel economy measurements is presented. 760142. Effects of Pressure Variations and Combustion Duration on the Emission of Hydrocarbons and Nitric Oxide. K. S. Varde, University of Mich- igan; and G. G. Lucas, University of Technol- ogy (United Kingdom). Emissions of nitric oxide and hydrocarbons are affected by various parameters, combustion duration interval being one of them that can alter the levels of nitric oxide in the exhaust. To some extent hydrocarbon emission depends upon the temperature particularly near the walls. Changes in combustion duration interval alters pressure history in the chamber by changing maximum pressure, rate of pressure rise and the time required for the maximum pressure to occur. This study looks at the relative effects of this on the nitric oxide formation and investigates the hydrocarbon emission when the flame initiation point is changed. 760143. Honeycomb Auto Exhaust Catalysts Containing Copper Chromíte and Palladium. J. T. Kummer, Y. Yao and D. McKee, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A copper chromite Zr02 honeycomb catalyst has been evaluated in the laboratory and to a limited extent on vehicles. When 650-850 grams of this catalyst (1.4-1.9 lbs) is dispersed on two honeycombs and used to catalytically 35</page><page sequence="23">760144-760151 treat the exhaust of a 4500 lb, 400 in3 Torino, the percent oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons during the Federal Test Procedure are close to, but less than that produced by present noble metal production catalysts. The total active catalyst surface area available with copper chromite Zr02 catalyst is somewhat marginal and this leads to pro- nounced susceptibility to lead deactivation during dura- bility even at very low lead levels if the peak catalyst operating temperature is high (900°C). It is desirable to operate below 700-750°C. Catalyst operating temperatures greater than 550-600°C are necessary to suppress sulfur deactivation without special operating procedures so that this leaves only a narrow temperature range of operation if the catalyst activity is to be preserved. Catalysts containing a low level of palladium appear to offer a competitive alternate to the use of a high catalyst loading base metal catalyst. The problem of a limited total active catalyst surface area and susceptibility to lead are still present but other constraints are eased. 1976 SA E Transactions 760144. The First Digital Automotive Diagnostic System - Autosense. K. Parker and P. D. Miller, Hamilton Test Systems, Inc. Conventional methods of vehicle problem diagnosis have become ineffective in the present day automotive service industry. Skilled mechanics are being promoted to levels of supervision and those remaining are finding their knowledge and experience are rapidly becoming outdated with the increasing complexity of motor vehicles. Test equipment is being obsoleted by the development of radically new vehicle systems and introduction of gov- ernment regulation of vehicle performance. The driving public is faced with a decline in automotive service quality accompanied by steadily rising service costs. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new approach to vehicle test and diagnosis, the first digital Automotive diagnostic system - AutosenseR. The AutosenseR Computerized Digital Diagnostic System is designed to assist mechanics, at all skill levels, test and diagnose today's newest vehicles. The System can run individual tests, and thus be used by the mechanics as a tool, or automatically step the mechanic through a sequence of tests to diagnose a specific vehicle problem, totally check a vehicle or its individual systems. The System compares actual vehicle performance to manu- facturer's vehicle specifications and provides the mechanic with recommended repairs. The system also provides the mechanic and the customer with a hard-copy print-out of all tests performed, the actual vehicle specifications and all recommended repairs. This paper describes the AutosenseR Computerized Digital Diagnostic System. 760145. Approving Diagnostic/ Repair Centers - Does This Provide a Meaningful Service? Maury Kramer and Louis J. Bintz, Automobile Club of Southern California. The Automobile Club of Southern California has a responsibility of responding to the needs of the motoring public. With the complexity and sophistication of today's vehicles, one of the major needs is for an improvement in automotive diagnostic and repair facilities. To meet this need the Club instituted its Approved Diagnostic/ Repair Center Program five years ago. The dual purposes of this effort are to generally upgrade the quality of services rendered by the repair industry and to provide Club members with a means of securing quality repairs at realistic costs with recourse in those cases where a repair proves to be less than satisfactory. This paper reports the process by which the program was instituted, the experience to date, the response of the motoring public, and some possible future programs. 760146. Non-Contact Diagnosis of Internal Combustion Engine Faults Through Remote Sensing. S. C. Hadden, L. R. Hulls and E. M. Sutphin, Government and Commercial Systems Div., RCA Corp. A method has been developed for obtaining engine speed and diagnostic information for a diesel engine without mechanical or electrical connections to the engine. This non contact technique has the potential for making diesel engine power measurement and fault detection extremely simple and rapid. The method employs a single transducer held near the engine and special purpose circuitry which extracts the engine speed information from the signal and performs spectral analysis for diagnostic purposes. Circuit outputs are engine speed, a digital pulse train with repetition rate proportional to engine speed, and a harmonic ratio which sensitively indicates the degree of nonuniformity among engine cylinders. By this method diesel engines with minor compression losses or fuel injection faults can readily be identified without vehicle contact in less than one minute of testing. With additional signal processing, the power producing capability of the engine can also rapidly be evaluated. 1976 SA E Transactions 760148. New Solid State Magneto Ignition and Lighting Controls for Recreational Vehicles. T. Frazer Carmichael, Syncro Corp. The universal adaption of the solid state magneto for use on recreational vehicle power plants is discussed, includ- ing design information. The various means of control for lighting systems, for recreational vehicles are described as to performance and application. 760151. The Fourier Transform Applied to Vehicle Exte- rior Noise Source Identification. V. A. Daniels and R. E. Veres, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses a motor vehicle noise source identification technique designed for use during the SAE J986a or similar drive-by test procedure. It provides, by application of the Fourier Transform, the capability to obtain a narrowband (9.8 Hz) frequency resolution over 36</page><page sequence="24">760152-760156 an extended frequency range (0-10,000 Hz) at the peak vehicle noise level, a particular RPM, or a particular vehicle location in the test zone. Other features include corrections for the Doppler shift, averaging of noise tests, and subtraction of spectra of two separate noise tests from a component disconnect/reconnect procedure. The above analysis, in conjunction with the noise source isolation resulting directly from the disconnect procedure, identifies the major vehicle noise contributors in terms of their respective amplitudes and frequencies. Application of this technique to several vehicles has demonstrated its ability to accurately identify the dB(A) levels and problem frequencies of the major vehicle noise contributors in the vehicle environment. 760152. A Tire Noise Investigation and Test Method. R. E. Veres, Ford Motor Co. This paper reports the results of an exterior tire noise investigation whose purpose was the determination of present passenger car tire noise levels and the devel- opment of a passenger car tire noise test. Several operational and measurement parameters including road surface texture and microphone distance and height were studied. The investigation resulted in a passenger car tire noise test procedure taking into account the importance of conducting tire noise tests on a standardized road surface texture. Fourteen sets of tires, consisting of thirteen 1975 experimental and production constructions and one ASTM skid test tire were used. Testing consisted of coasting at various speeds on three different road surfaces past microphones which were located at 25 and 50 feet from the vehicle centerline at ground level and 4 feet height. The major results were: Road Surface Macrotexture change (Portland cement, epoxy paint, and asphalt) exhibited greater noise variation than the difference between the 11 tire constructions, which included one snow tire, tested on the same surface. Load Variation from light (driver only) to maximum design load showed only small changes of up to 1 dBA for a particular car. Tire Wear may be a factor for the first 200 miles. After this break-in period, variation up to the tested 1000 miles is minor. Vehicle Speed has a major effect on tire noise; a 2 mph variation can result in up to 1 dBA change at medium speed. Tire Noise contribution can be significant in 1979 when the vehicle acceptance limit is 75 dBA in Florida and Oregon. In summary, surface and speed effect is significant and has to be controlled precisely for repeatable results. In spite of the wide variety of tires which included the almost treadless skid tire and a snow tire, the tire noise variance averaged only 2.5 dBA. This indicates that noise reduc- tions beyond 2 dBA for passenger car tires will be very difficult to achieve with changes in the tread design. 1976 SA E Transactions 760153. Tire Rolling Resistance Measurements From Coast-Down Tests. B. Dayman, Jr., Jet Propul- sion Laboratory. Tire rolling resistance information is generally obtained in the laboratory by use of the rotating drum technique. Coast-down tests of road vehicles, when properly carried out, will relate laboratory-measured tire rolling resistance to the rolling resistance that exists under actual operating conditions. Also, these road tests can be used to compare the rolling resistances of several sets of tires. This paper describes the procedures that must be followed and the limitations that exist in the determination of tire rolling resistance from coast-down tests. The results of one such test are used as an example of the method. 760155. Engine Cycle Simulations and Comparisons to Real Engine Performance. A. C. Malliaris, T. Trella and H. Gould, U.S. Dept. of Transpor- tation. An analytical framework is assembled, suitable for the quantitative evaluation of engine performance (fuel consumption, WOT, NOx emissions) and the appreciation of engine performance sensitivities and trade-offs. Em- phasis is placed on complete, conventional spark-ignition engines in production. The framework is assembled primarily from existing and well documented analyses that deal effectively with various specific aspects of the internal combustion engine. A new and nonconventional approach is followed in the treatment of engine breathing dynamics. The engine-manifold system is treated and documented as a sequence of many small but finite control volumes, each obeying individually the field form of conservation equations. The qualifications of the analytical framework are evaluated by an extensive comparison of analytical results to dynamometer test results of engines with fairly well known design and control parameters, which are also presented. Results of two production (one 8- and one 4- cylinder) engines are used over a wide range of loads and speeds. Extensive comparisons are illustrated of BMEP, BSFC, BSNOX and WOT air flow. Agreement ranging from good to fair is observed depending on operating conditions, with the comparison becoming poorer at very low loads and high EGR rates. Various factors, limiting the resolution of applications are discussed. 760156. A Technique for Obtaining an Engine Emissions Model Based on Continuous EPA-CVS Test Data and a Dynamic Vehicle Model. Richard Radtke, Andrew Frank and Norman Beachley, University of Wisconsin at Madison. A new technique for obtaining engine emission flow rate maps has been developed. The maps are based on specific emissions data obtained on a continuous basis over a single EPA-CVS urban driving cycle test. The data are averaged for the various torque-speed ranges of the engine. It has been found that these dynamic average emission flow rate maps, which are functions only of 37</page><page sequence="25">760157-760161 engine torque and speed, allow instantaneous emissions to be fairly accurately predicted. It also appears that the technique might be used advantageously to determine engine calibration parameters. 760157. Simulated Sensitivities of Auto Fuel Economy, Performance and Emissions. A. C. Malliaris, E. Withjack and H. Gould, U.S. Dept. of Trans- portation. The subject is treated on the basis of detailed engineering test data regarding components and parameters of 1975 autos. The applicability of the simulation approach is examined by extensive comparisons with integrated vehicle test results. It is found that fuel economy, for the EPA driving schedules, is adequately simulated with 5% to 10% uncertainties. Uncertainties of the same magnitude are also encountered in performance simulations. Larger uncertainties are evident in the simulation of emissions. NOx prediction has an uncertainty up to 25% but no significant bias, while CO and HC are very substantially over-predicted and under-predicted respectively. Except- ing HC and CO, several applications are made in the evaluation of sensitivities to various auto components and parameters. Evaluations are made of changes in auto weight, engine displacement and rear axle ratio, consid- ered individually and in combinations. Drivetrain changes are also evaluated for three speed automatic transmis- sions. These include individually or in combinations: a wider range of gear ratios, the addition of a fourth gear and various schemes of torque converter lock-up. 760158. Powertrain Simulation: A Tool for the Design and Evaluation of Engine Control Strategies in Vehicles. Paul N. Blumberg, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A powertrain simulation model to translate the demands of a vehicle driving schedule into an engine RPM/torque versus time trajectory is developed. The formulation of a time density matrix in the speed/load plane of the engine allows a rational approach to the selection of dynamom- eter test points for emission control strategy development, fuel economy improvement and/or component devel- opment and evaluation. Steady-state engine dynamometer data combined with the results of the powertrain model can be used to project emissions and fuel economy values for an entire drive cycle such as CVS-Hot. This provides the development engineer with a powerful tool to make preliminary assessments of the potential of various control strategies or intended component modifications without the necessity of building a complete vehicle prototype. It also provides the basic building block for optimizing emission control strategy to meet required constraints with maximum fuel economy. Limited comparisons between actual vehicle tests and powertrain projections show good agreement in trends. 760159. Effects of Engine Variables on Turbulence in a Spark-Ignition Engine. David R. Lancaster, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Measurements of turbulence within the cylinder of a motored CFR engine were taken with a hot-wire ane- mometer. Tests were conducted over a range of engine speeds, volumetric efficiencies, and compression ratios with both shrouded and nonshrouded intake valves. Data were processed digitally using both ensemble- and time-averaging techniques. Mean velocities, turbulent intensities, and turbulent micro and integral scales were computed. A nonstationary time-averaged analysis was found to give consistent and physically reasonable results. The turbulence which exists near TDC of compression was found to be isotropic, with both its intensity and scale determined by the intake process. 1976 SA E Transactions 760160. Effects of Turbulence on Spark-Ignition Engine Combustion. David R. Lancaster and Roger B. Krieger, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; Spencer C. Sorenson and William L. Hull, Mechanical Engineering Dept., University of Illinois. The effects of mixture turbulence on combustion in a spark-ignition engine were investigated using a CFR engine. The apparent instantaneous turbulent flame speed during combustion was calculated from a combustion heat release model that used measured cylinder pressures and assumed spherical flame propagation. This flame speed was correlated with turbulent intensities measured in the motored engine. The ratio of fully developed turbulent flame speed to laminar flame speed was found to be a linear function of motored turbulent intensity. 1976 SA E Transactions 760161. Performance and NOx Emissions Modeling of a Jet Ignition Prechamber Stratified Charge En- gine. S. D. Hires, Ford Motor Company; and A. Ekchian, J. B. Heywood, R. J. Tabaczynski and J. C. Wall, Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. The development of a cycle simulation model for the jet ignition prechamber stratified charge engine is described. Given the engine geometry, load, speed, air-fuel ratios and pressures and temperatures in the two intakes, flow ratio and a suitable combustion model, the cycle simulation predicts engine indicated efficiency and NO emissions. The relative importance of the parameters required to define the combustion model are then determined, and values for ignition delay and burn angle are obtained by matching predicted and measured pressure-time curves. The variation in combustion parameters with engine operating variables is then examined. Predicted and measured NO emissions are compared, and found to be in reasonable agreement over a wide range of engine operation. The relative contribution of the prechamber NO to total exhaust NO is then examined, and in the absence of EGR, found to be the major source of NO for overall air-fuel ratios leaner than 22:1. 1976 SA E Transactions 38</page><page sequence="26">760162-760170 760162. The Effects of Fluid Motions on Combustion in a Prechamber Bomb. Edward D. Klomp and Gail R. Deboy, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A two-chamber bomb was used to investigate the effect of fluid motions on combustion characteristics, in particular exhaust emissions. Variations in prechamber volume, connecting orifice geometry, air-fuel charge stratification, and initial turbulence of the charge were examined. Tests were run over a wide air-fuel ratio range. High speed motion pictures were used to study flame propagation and fluid motions. The results show that when the strength of the turbulent jet from the pre- chamber is varied over a significant range, there is little or no effect on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) over the entire air-fuel ratio range. Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were found to increase with jet strength in the portion of the lean air-fuel range of most interest (i.e., around 17:1). However, for very lean mixtures the trend was reversed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760163. The Influence of an Ignition Accelerator on the Ignition Quality and Anti-Knock Properties of Light Hydrocarbons in the Diesel Engine. Klaus Becker, Umweltbundesamt (West Germany). Based upon the standard cetane method and the BASF test engine commonly used in Germany a test method was developed which enables the low cetane numbers of commercial gasolines and light hydrocarbons to be measured. By means of this modified cetane test method systematic investigations were made into pure hydro- carbons of different chemical structure, some gasoline stocks and commercial gasolines. The effects on cetane number increasing by the ignition improver cyclo- hexanolnitrate were investigated. The octane number decrease which is automatically combined with the cetane number increase was also tested, because an optimum of cetane number increase and octane number decrease might be desirable. 1976 SA E Transactions 760164. Aluminum in Automobiles: Why and How It's Used. R. A. George, W. E. Swenson and D. G. Adams, Materials Engineering Chrysler Cor- poration. The use of aluminum in automobiles can significantly reduce vehicle weight. This paper discusses factors that relate to why aluminum will be used in automobiles. These factors are fuel economy, fuel cost, federal regulations, and increasing weight trends. The cost of reducing weight is analyzed by the overall economy concept. Overall economy includes operating cost and initial purchase price. The role of inertia weight class and interacting weight reduction are discussed and exempli- fied by two vehicles. One is a production vehicle, the Feather Duster and the other is a prototype called the Charger XL. The substitution of aluminum into conven- tional applications sometimes requires the developing of new technology in design and manufacturing. These aspects of how aluminum will be used in automobiles is also discussed. This paper discusses reasons why automotive weight reduction through aluminum usage will be considered more often in future applications. Manufacturability and part performance are critical considerations when new materials are applied to a production part. This paper also discusses the technical aspects of using aluminum in body panels, bumper systems, and miscellaneous parts using the Feather Duster and Charger XL as examples. 1976 SA E Transactions 760165. Dynamic Denting of Autobody Panels. C. E. Burley, B. A. Niemeier and G. P. Koch, Rey- nolds Metals Co. Dynamic denting properties of aluminum and steel autobody panels have been experimentally measured under controlled conditions. Material, geometric and dynamic factors have been graphically and statistically evaluated to determine design equations. For impact velocities of 20-60 mph and sheet gauges of 0.027-0.040", dent depths are shown as linear functions of impact velocity. This linear velocity model incorporates sheet thickness, yield strength, density and modulus of elasticity of the alloy used, as well as the geometric shape of the fabricated panel. As an example, for equal dent resistance, a panel of 2036-T4 aluminum would need to be 10-13% thicker than the same panel fabricated from 0.035 " gauge 1010-CQ steel. 760167. Nickel Plated Electrodes for Spot Welding Aluminum. Michael A. Glagola and Calvin A. Roest, Reynolds Metals Co. A new type plated electrode has been developed which shows considerable promise for spot welding mill finish and mechanically cleaned aluminum sheet. This electrode consists of preconditioning the tips of regular Class I and Class II electrodes followed by an inexpensive electro- plating of dull nickel. Laboratory data has shown that 2000 spots can be made on mill finished 2036 aluminum using this plated electrode. On wirebrushed 5182-0, 3750 welds were made before failure occurred. This represents a significant increase in tip life compared to tests run using regular copper electrodes. The paper gives details as to how the nickel plated electrodes were developed. This includes results from evaluating other electrode plating and capping materials. The results of tests run using the plated electrodes are included as part of the paper, as well as a discussion as to why the nickel plating works when spot welding alu- minum. 1976 SA E Transactions 760170. An Ionization Probe Study of Small Engine Combustion Chambers. Steven A. Johnson, Onan 39</page><page sequence="27">760171 -760177 Div., Onan Corp.; David B. Kittelson and Thomas E. Murphy, University of Minnesota. Combustion characteristics of an L-head engine combus- tion chamber have been examined using ionization probes and piezioelectric pressure transducers. The method describes how pressure rise rates, peak pressures, mean effective pressures, and flame arrival times were recorded. The flame arrival times were then used to find the position and shape of the flame front as a function of time. The influence of spark plug location on the above parameters was then examined for two different combustion chamber shapes. 760171. International Cub Cadet Garden Tractors. David A. Fulghum, International Harvester Co. The 1975 line of Cub Cadet tractors incorporates several new design features aimed at reducing the noise and vibration levels of these machines. These features include an iso-mounted engine and an engine enclosure. The drive train is modified to accommodate the iso-mounted engine, and several changes have been made to provide for adequate engine cooling. 760172. Comparison of Computer Predictions and Exper- imental Tests for Two-Stroke Engine Exhaust Systems. Michael Ospring, Dean Karnopp and Donald Margolis, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, University of California at Davis. The effect of exhaust system configuration upon per- formance of two-stroke engines is explored. Computer predictions of gas dynamic behavior in the exhaust pipes are compared to experimental results of real pipe tests. Predicted pressure, velocity and temperature histories at key points in the exhaust system explain the relative power differences for the test pipes. Predicted volumetric flow rates show the effectiveness of exhausting gases at larger pipe cross sectional areas in reducing noise output. The application of the computer predictions to a Yamaha RS 100 offers an explanation for the experi- mentally measured loss of power at midrange engine speeds encountered using one of the two test pipes. A relative comparison of the two systems shows that the differing pipe geometries cause predicted pressure and velocity histories to change. These changes are correlated to actual power curves. An experimental exhaust system is presented for the Yamaha 360 MX which increases power and is quieter than the stock system. Computer predictions are used to explain the increased performance. 760173. Plastics in the Automobile Industry in Europe. Hermann Hablitzel, Volks wagen werk AG (Ger- many). When the sudden shortage of a material and the resulting price escalation put regular vehicle production in doubt, users think twice about its current and future application. The oil crisis caused the European automotive industry to double-think its use of once cheap and plentiful plastic. Full exploitation of this material became an economic necessity, and careful, long-range planning made the situation liveable. Plastic with a high use-value factor increased in use, and certain 'expensive' plastics have become more appealing. But only those projects that are within the foreseeable future will stay on the front burner. 760175. A Guide for the Self-Heating of Plastic Structural Members Under Dynamic Periodical Loads. N. Brand and G. Menges, Institut fur Kunststoff- verarbeitung (West Germany). Based on their viscoelastic properties, the temperature of plastic structural members under oscillatory loads rises during the loading time. For the case that this temperature reaches a constant value, i.e. an equilibrium between the supplied and the delivered heat is established, the temperature rise can be calculated in the presented manner. Below the critical strain limit, the behaviour of the self-heated material is similar to its behaviour at cor- responding increased environmental temperature. With the knowledge of this fact, the consideration of the self-heating of plastics is easily possible. 1976 SA E Transactions 760176. The Critical Strain of Plastics, in Particular of Chopped Strand Glass Mat Reinforced Plastics Under High Rates of Deformation. B. Meffert, G. Wiegand and G. Menges, Institut für Kunst- stoffverarbeitung (West Germany). Investigations of the mechanical behaviour of materials have proved the existence of critical strain limits for plastics. The exceeding of these limits leads to the formation of irreversible damages in the microstructure of the materials. Measuring procedures for the determination of the first material damages are pointed out and evaluated. By means of a special example, the investigation of the microcracks development of a chopped strand glass mat reinforced UP-resin under uniaxial tensile loading up to high rates of deformation, it can be proved that even for extremely quick deformation processes, unequivocal determination of the critical strain is still possible. 1976 SA E Transactions 760177. New Solutions for the Trim of Automotive Vehicles. Heinz-Gard Reinkemeyer, Dynamit Nobel Aktiengesellschaft (Germany). Based on the merits of cross linked polyethylene foam, i.e. good thermoformability, low weight, strength, and lamina- bility to other materials, Dynamit Nobel has developed new techniques and components for the trim in auto- motive vehicles. We have described trim parts such as roof linings, floor coverings, seats, trunk lining, and hood lining which are either being tested or already installed on standard models. They offer advantages over traditional compo- nents with regard to weight, comfort and price. 40</page><page sequence="28">760178-760183 760178. Multiplexing - Past, Present, and Future. Robert E. Bell, Essex International. Multiplexing has recently become a subject of consid- erable interest to the automotive industry. Although the idea is not new, it has only found wide application in other fields in recent years through the power of modern electronics. Perhaps, the time is at hand for its application in the automotive field. It may be the only answer to the increasing complexity of automotive wiring. This paper reviews the history of the early and more recent developments of multiplexing along with the reasons for its development. It also covers current applications with particular emphasis on the automotive field. Vehicular applications are reviewed with respect to their potential advantages over conventional wiring systems. Consideration is given to cost effectiveness, reliability and feature availability. Prerequisites for choosing multiplexing over conventional wiring are defined. 760179. Photo-Cybernetics: Fiber Optics Use in Motor Vehicle Electronic Controls and Monitors. A. H. Brennesholtz and T. C. Balkenhol, Du Pont Co. Electronic multiplexing control systems in aircraft have demonstrated utility in reducing the complexity and weight of wiring harnesses. Currently, there is much interest throughout the automotive industry in adapting multiplexing control techniques to obtain similar reduc- tions in complexity and weight of the wiring harness in motor vehicles. Use of optical fiber control cables in aircraft multi- plexing systems has also been demonstrated. Similar optical control systems are under study in the automotive industry because of their advantages over multiplexing systems using copper wire control links: visible light signals sent through fiber optic cables are not subject to electromagnetic interference; fiber optic cables are rela- tively inexpensive, lightweight, and easy to repair in the field. The paper shows simplified wiring diagrams for an electro-optical multiplexing control system and describes how such a system can be fabricated, installed, and repaired. In addition, examples of fiber optics monitoring systems are illustrated and explained. 760180. Automotive Load Switching Using Gate Con- trolled, Silicon Controlled Rectifiers. J. Wojslawowicz, RCA/Solid State Division. A solid-state device, the gate-controlled, silicon controlled rectifier, or GTO SCR, that can be turned on and off by the application of a signal to its gate can be used in automotive electrical systems as a remote power switch to reduce the complexity and size of the wiring presently required. Device characteristics and ratings are discussed, and sample circuits are described. 1976 SA E Transactions 760181. Time-Shared Multiplexing System Applied to Motor Vehicles. L. J. Nevett, Lucas Electrical, Ltd. (United Kingdom). Although motor vehicle electrical systems have been continuously increasing in complexity over the past 30 years or so, little attention has been paid to the wiring harness beyond changes to packaging and terminations. Sporadic efforts have been made to demonstrate the practicability of systems which, by virtue of the use of a power supply ring, have borne the somewhat misleading name of Ring Main Signalling systems. All have at- tempted to simplify the unwieldy conventional harness by replacing it with a number of signalling leads packaged with the power ring. This paper deals primarily with the application of a Time-shared Multiplexing System to public service vehi- cles and postulates the advantages of such a system over others which have been proposed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760182. Applications of Computer Graphics to Automotive Structural Analysis. Ashok A. Aguiar, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp. Four applications of interactive graphics to structural analysis are described: finite element modelling, com- putation of section properties, analysis of suspension loads, and dynamics of frame crush. The graphic system used consists of a Bendix Datagrid digitizing table, Tektronix 4014 storage type display tube and hard-copy unit. The digitizing table is used to obtain three-dimen- sional nodal co-ordinates from drawings. These points are used to generate finite elements interactively, and the data thus generated is interfaced with a number of batch mode computer programs. Results are stored on a disk file, and the graphics system is then used to view deflections, mode shapes and stress patterns. Section properties of beam members can also be determined on line by digitizing sections into straight line segments. In the analysis of suspension loads the graphics system is used to check model geometry and to view the results computed by a large displacement program. The simulation of dynamic frame crush illustrates the use of a program that allows interactive composition of output variable plots. 760183. Analysis of Vehicle Suspensions with Static and Dynamic Computer Simulations. Joseph S. Majcher, Rodney D. Michaelson, Arthur R. Solomon and Jay W. Subhedar, Chevrolet Div., General Motors Corp. Two types of computer simulations are used extensively by Chevrolet to analyze vehicle suspension systems. The first is a nonlinear static analysis and the second is a linear dynamic analysis. These simulations are used to help evaluate proposed suspension designs for loads, dynamic force transmissibility, and various ride and handling characteristics well before prototype hardware is built and 41</page><page sequence="29">760184-760189 tested. Load outputs from these simulations are input to finite element models to analyse stresses in frames, control arms, and other related vehicle components of interest. 1976 SA E Transactions 760184. Structural-Acoustic Finite Element Analysis of the Automobile Passenger Compartment. Joseph A. Wolf, Jr., Donald J. Nefske and Larry J. Howell, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The objective of this paper is to give illustrative solutions for the types of combined structural and acoustic problems which arise in the finite element analysis of the automobile passenger compartment and to review related methodology. Analysis implementation using the NASTRAN (NASA STRuctural ANalysis) computer program is discussed briefly, including the use of modal compartment wall models and forced boundary condi- tions. The model is a two dimensional one, assuming a uniform pressure field in the cross-body direction. This simplification appears to be adequate for the frequency range of interest (20 to 80 Hz). 1976 SA E Transactions 760185. The Optimization of Body Details - A Method for Reducing the Aerodynamic Drag of Road Vehi- cles. W. H. Hucho, L. J. Janssen and H. J. Emmelmann, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). Different techniques to reduce the aerodynamic drag of cars have been utilized in the past. Although the best results can be achieved with streamlined bodies, these have not generally been acceptable to the buying public. In order to make use of the potential of aerodynamics nevertheless, a procedure called detail optimization has been developed by Volks wagen werk AG. Representative results achieved with this technique are reported. The step by step drag reduction of several passenger cars is illustrated. The consequent reduction in fuel consumption has been investigated for steady state driving as well as for standardized cycles. 1976 SA E Transactions 760186. The Body Shape of Minimum Drag. A. Morelli, Politecnico di Torino (Italy); L. Fioravanti and A. Cogotti, Research Centre, Pininfarina (Italy). After a short review of the work done in the past to reduce the aerodynamic drag of a body moving in the vicinity of the ground, a new theoretical method is developed in order to determine the shape of the body when a certain lift distribution is imposed. Considerations on the induced drag suggest that the total lift is zero as also should be zero the pitching moment for stability reasons. These condi- tions together with that of gradual variation of the area and shape of the cross sections of the body lead to the determination of the basic shape of the body. A model was realized and tested on the Pininfarina wind tunnel. The results show a good substantiation of the theory and a very low drag coefficient. The dimensions of the model were such as to achieve the actual Reynolds numbers of motor cars. Energy implications of a reduction on the aerodynamic drag are also indicated. 760187. Reducing Fuel Consumption By Means of Aer- odynamic 'Add-On' Devices. G. W. Carr, Motor Industry Research Association (United King- dom). The scope for reduction of aerodynamic drag of passenger cars by 'add-on' devices has been examined by MIRA in a study sponsored by the U.K. Government. On a car of the popular 'hatch-back' style the drag was reduced by up to 31 per cent by these means without detriment to other aerodynamic characteristics. Fuel consumption tests with a similar car showed that with a combination of 'add-on' devices giving a 14 per cent drag reduction an overall fuel saving of 6 per cent could be obtained in mixed road conditions. 760188. Aerodynamic Effects of Front End Design on Automobile Engine Cooling Systems. M. E. Olson, Ford Motor Co. Baseline wind tunnel programs have been conducted to develop the capability of determining vehicle front-end aerodynamic effects on engine cooling system airflow. Traditionally, the determination of these types of airflow effects has been difficult to obtain due to the upward and outward curvature characteristics of the capture stream tube ahead of the grille, as well as the turbulent characteristics of the expanding airflow directly behind the grille and bumper. A testing technique, utilizing a rake of multiple vane-anemometers, was developed to determine the total airflow and airflow distribution. This technique provided excellent results and it was determined that it was possible to quantify the total airflow and distribution as effected by various front-end, flow area components. The effect of the bumper, grille, air dam, fan and shroud were clearly discernible. 1976 SA E Transactions 760189. A Parametric Investigation of the Validity of 1/25 Scale Automobile Aerodynamic Testing. Marvin E. Doberenz and Bruce P. Selberg, University of Missouri at Rolla. Wind tunnel tests have been performed measuring the aerodynamic forces and underbody boundary layer profiles for 1/25 scale models. The trends of the force coefficients with Reynolds number, the underbody boundary layer profiles, and the influence of the ground plane boundary layer on the force coefficients of small scale models has been shown to be similar with previous results from larger models. This study has shown the usefulness of small scale models for parametric studies of automobile aerodynamics. The agreement of the data with previous results, also supports the possibility of a method of correction for boundary layer growth on fixed ground planes used in automobile model testing. 42</page><page sequence="30">760190-760198 760190. Human Engineering Specifications and Stan- dards: Payoffs and Pitfalls. Gerald Chaikin, U.S. Army Human Engineering Laboratory. The most visible human engineering standard in current use is MIL-STD-1472, "Human Engineering Design Criteria for Military Systems, Equipment and Facilities." Using this document as an example, benefits of and precautions in its use are explored. Background is presented on content, requirement categories, binding vs advisory provisions, sources of the criteria, and the development and revision process. 760191. Noise Limits for Army Materiel. D. C. Hodge and G. R. Garinther, U.S. Army Human En- gineering Laboratory. MIL-STD-1474A(MI), published in March 1975, provides acoustical noise design limits for five problem areas peculiar to US Army equipment and operations: haz- ardous steady-state noise; non-hazardous steady-state noise; hazardous impulse noise (gunfire); exterior noise; and aural non-detectability. This paper describes the provisions of the Standard, notes some difficulties that have been encountered in applying its provisions, and predicts the eventual impact of its use on equipment design and utilization. 760192. Some Recent Trends in Human Factors Testing. John L. Miles, Jr., U.S. Human Engineering Laboratory. Three recent Army policy decisions have altered tradi- tional concepts of human factors testing. Test data now need to account for the performance of the soldier in a system. This paper explores how such data may be used and the expanded role of the contractor in collecting them. 760195. (SP-403) ORI of Today's Vehicles. B. D. Keller, G. H. Meguerian, C. B. Tracy and J. B. Smith, Amoco Oil Co. Studies with cars and with full scale engines in the laboratory have provided additional information on the parameters which affect ORI in today's cars. Tests conducted with cars showed that ORI with unleaded gasolines is about two units higher than with leaded gasolines and that coolant system degradation had little or no effect. Studies conducted in the laboratory showed that oil consumption rate, oil multi-grade range, fuel detergent additives, and coolant temperature all affected ORI to some degree. Oil ash level and a manganese antiknock additive had no effect. Combustion chamber deposits studies showed that a good correlation exists between ORI and the ratio of carbon to metals in the deposits. This correlation suggests that the carbon to metals ratio should be minimized to reduce ORI. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and to further define the parameters which must be controlled to minimize ORI. 760196. (SP-403) More Data on ORI Variables. R. B. Saillant, F. J. Pedrys and H. E. Kidder, Engi- neering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. The effects of selected fuel additives, engine operating conditions, and driving modes on ORI have been investigated for the 1975 Ford 400 CID engine. A twenty-seven vehicle program was designed with three vehicles per variable. Reduced coolant temperatures significantly lowered ORI. Methanol appears to reduce ORI. Variables which do not produce strong trends are increased air-fuel ratio, a driving cycle with wide open throttle accelerations, a fuel with a carrier oil additive, and heavier fuels. An inverse relationship between initial octane re- quirements and ORI was observed. 760197. (SP-403) Performance Characteristics of Strat- ified Charge Vehicles with Conventional Fuels and Gasoline Blended with Alcohol and Water. K. L. Boekhaus and L. C. Copeland, Atlantic Richfield Co. The effects of fuel volatility and alcohol content on vehicular performance were determined in unmodified conventional, prechamber stratified charge, and direct injection open-chamber stratified charge vehicles. A clear water-gasoline emulsion fuel was included in the test sequence. Driveability testing revealed that the stratified charge powered vehicles were relatively insensitive to base fuel volatility. Driveability depreciated with increasing alcohol content for all vehicles. Testing of the water- gasoline emulsion showed driveability was unsatisfactory in vehicles powered with conventional and prechamber stratified charge engines but marginally acceptable in the open-chamber stratified charge engine. Increasing alcohol content up to 20 V % increased mass emissions of the open-chamber stratified charge engine, reduced emissions of the prechamber stratified charge engine, and had no significant effect on the conventional engine. Fuel economy on an energy utilization basis was improved with increasing alcohol content and reduced with the water- gasoline emulsion. 760198. (SP-403) The Effects of Engine Variables and Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Emissions, Fuel Economy, and Knock - Part II. C. R. Morgan and S. S. Hetrick, Mobil R&amp;D Corp. Steady-state data obtained from a 400 CID V-8 conven- tional engine at one speed/load/ compression ratio combination are reported to show the effect of engine emission constraints on fuel consumption and octane number for trace knock. The important trends shown by these results were: Various calibration combinations of air/fuel (A/F) ratio, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and spark retard can be used to control NOx emissions. A substantial reduction in NOx emissions was achieved by using EGR and optimized spark timing without suffering a fuel economy penalty; but hydrocarbon (HC) emissions 43</page><page sequence="31">760199-760202 tended to be high. When both HC and NOx emissions were reduced by optimal adjustments of EGR and spark timing, fuel consumption was increased, but octane number for trace knock was decreased. At controlled NOx emission levels, the lowest HC emissions were obtained at A/F ratios of 16 to 18:1. The minimum achievable HC emission level increased with decreasing NOx emissions. Injection of secondary air at the exhaust ports generally decreased HC emissions at A/F ratios richer than stoichiometric when the engine exhaust temperatures were greater than 1100°F. Use of secondary air at lean A/F ratios increased HC emissions. In general, through the use of the basic engine parameters investigated, the substantial reduction in engine emissions of HC and NOx was associated with a fuel consumption penalty and with a reduction in the octane number for trace knock measured under the emission test conditions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760199. (SP-403) NOx Catalytic Converter Development. Y. Kaneko, T. Ohinouye, H. Kobayashi and S. Abe, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (Japan). The ammonia forming characteristics of two NOx cata- lysts have been thoroughly studied under steady-state conditions after defining the ranges of such parameters as intake air flow, inlet gas temperature, inlet exhaust emissions and inlet C0/02 under the CVS-III (hot) mode. A four-cylinder 1.6 liter engine equipped with a dual-bed catalytic converter system was used. Two catalysts having the same catalytic materials and loadings were prepared on pelleted and monolithic supports. The test results show how and why the bleed air, added ahead of the NOx catalyst, is effective in reducing ammonia formation and improving the net NOx reduction efficiency of the system. 760200. (SP-403) Study of NH3 Formation and Its Control in the NOx Catalyst System. Hiroshi Kuroda, Yasuo Nakajima, Tsuneaki Saito, Takeji Oguri and Tadashi Nagai, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Suppression of NH3 formation over NOx catalysts has been the subject of several reports in recent years. However, there are very few reports relating to the effects of modifications of both feed gas conditions and catalyst usage. Therefore, NH3 formation was investigated as a function of such feed gas boundary conditions as CO concentration, CO/02 ratio, space velocity, linear velocity and catalyst bed temperature. Both fresh and aged NOx catalysts were used. Longitudinal patterns of NH3 for- mation in monolithic NOx catalyst were also determined. Based on these results, several ideas were tested to reduce NH3 formation in the NOx catalyst through control of feed H2, 02, CO and HC concentrations. Finally, the possibility of extending the optimum A/F range of a NOx catalyst toward leaner A/F ratios by the introduction of methane ahead of the NOx catalyst is discussed. Although these studies increased our knowledge of NOx catalysis and use of NOx catalysts, many engineering problems still remain to be solved before NOx catalysts are used in production vehicles. 760201. (SP-403) Laboratory Evaluation of Three-Way Catalysts. H. S. Gandhi, A. G. Piken and M. Shelef, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and R. G. Delosh, Advanced Engine Engineering, Ford Motor Co. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation was carried out on recent three-way catalyst formulations. The evaluation of selectivity characteristics was made in a synthetic exhaust mixture where "window" widths and positions for three-way conversion and their change after durability runs were detemined. The durability runs were made in combusted gases from laboratory pulse-flame exhaust generators using both contaminant-free fuel and fuels with 1975 levels of Pb, P and S. A thorough evaluation of the "oxygen-storage" capability of the catalysts was per- formed and the results correlated with engine dyna- mometer experiments designed to utilize this property of three-way catalysts which allows a wider A/F ratio tolerance. A new technique which involves intentional modulation of the A/F ratio was found to extend the usefulness of such catalysts. The implications of the chemical formulation of the catalysts in the overall design of the system, which includes fuel metering and feedback control along with the catalyst, are discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760202. (SP-403) Characterization of Zirconia and Titania Engine Exhaust Gas Sensors for Air/ Fuel Feedback Control Systems. A. L. Cederquist, E. F. Gibbons and A. H. Meitzler, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Two types of exhaust sensors have been studied from the point of view of applying them in feedback systems to control the air/fuel (A/F) operating point of automotive engines. The particular sensors studied were zirconia (Zr02) sensors and titania (Ti02) sensors. Both sensors were without built-in heaters and designed to indicate when engine A/F passes through stoichiometry. The paper includes results obtained from engine dynamom- eters and test vehicles; but the major experimental results are from laboratory tests specifically designed to establish advantages or limitations of a specific sensor and its associated circuitry when used in engine A/F control systems. Calibration data were measured for the zirconia sensors in order to plot curves of sensor output voltage versus A/F with temperature (T) as a parameter. The zirconia sensor was found to be especially sensitive to the presence of hydrogen (H2) in exhaust gas. Data establish- ing this sensitivity are presented. Transient response 44</page><page sequence="32">760203 - 760207 capabilities of the zirconia sensor are explored and experimental results pointing to a structural transfor- mation in the sensor are presented. Experiments similar to those for the zirconia sensors were carried out for titania sensors. Calibration data for resistance as a function of A/F with T as a parameter are presented. Two effects observed in titania sensors in laboratory tests, transition-through-stoichiometry hy- steresis and rich-end-point drift, are described, along with some discussion of transient response capabilities. Since both types of sensors and their associated circuitry are in a continuing process of development, basic importance is attached to the measurement techniques and the general types of information developed rather than to the experimental results obtained for either particular sensor at the present time. 760203. Charger XL: A Lightweight Materials Devel- opment Vehicle. D. G. Adams, S. Dinda, R. A. George, R. W. Karry, A. S. Kasper, J. Pogorel, W. E. Swenson and W. L. Weeks, Materials Engineering Chrysler Corporation. The substantial development efforts made by the steel and aluminum industries have resulted in high strength- to-weight ratio materials that can be employed to achieve significant vehicle weight reduction. This total vehicle weight reduction is the sum of the initial weight savings attributable to lightweight material substitution and the iterative weight savings resulting from component weight interactions. The theoretical concept of vehicle interactive weight reduction was presented in a previous work. The present work reviews this theoretical concept and presents an experimental application: Charger XL, a lightweight materials development vehicle. Charger XL is 630 lb. (286 kg) lighter than its current, standard production counterpart. Lightweight materials substitu- tion accounts for 375 lb (171 kg) while the interacting savings accounts for the remaining 255 lb (115 kg). In addition to a review of the theoretical weight reduction analysis, the current work includes a review of Charger XL materials, the details of the resulting weight savings, and a discussion of potential energy savings. 1976 SA E Transactions 760204. Stiffening Methods for Sheet Steel. John N. Macadam, Armco Steel Corp. Reduction of steel sheet thickness as a means of reducing vehicle weight may necessitate some method of enhancing flexural stiffness. Three basic types of sheet stiffening methods have been investigated: integrally formed rib stiffeners, foam-backed sheets and embossed material. Means of calculating the stiffness obtained by each method is presented. The stiffness of integrally formed rib-stiffened sheets depends on the size and spacing of the ribs. The increase in stiffness of foam-backed sheets depends on the thickness and density of the rigid plastic foam. Embossed patterns increase sheet stiffness provided the embossing is relatively deep compared to sheet thickness. 760205. Photoelastic Stamping Analysis Adds Vision to New Automotive Material Developments. W. E. Swenson, Jr., Materials Development Engineer, Chrysler Corporation; and J. Pogorel, Senior Test and Development Technician Chrysler Corporation. This paper introduces a new technique, developed at Chrysler Corporation, for analyzing forming strains induced in sheet metal stampings. This technique, des- ignated as the Photoelastic Stamping Analysis, employs thin plastic, photoelastic coatings to visually illuminate the overall forming strain distributions and magnitudes, on the surface of formed parts. This is accomplished by modifying an established photoelastic coating technique, whereby, photoelastic strain measurement capabilities are extended from the elastic region to cover the total range of plastic deformation. This technique was developed to assist in resolving design and manufacturing problems related to developing materials for stamped sheet metal parts. Current formability tests are described, followed by the presentation and discussion of the Photoelastic Stamping Analysis. 1976 SA E Transactions 760206. GM 980X-A Unique High Strength Sheet Steel with Superior Formability. M. S. Rashid, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. Substituting high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels for plain carbon steel in strength limited automotive com- ponents could reduce weight and conserve steel. However, the poor formability of these steels has, in part, restricted their use in automotive applications. This paper discusses a simple treatment which transforms some commercially available 980X steels into a product with the following desirable mechanical properties: (a) Yield strength of 950X steels in the as-treated condition but equal to that of 980X steels after 2-3% deformation, (b) Tensile strength of 980X steels, (c) Superior formability, equal to or better than that of 950X steel in hot rolled gages, i.e., thicker than ~2 mm (0.075"), and approaching that of plain carbon steel in cold rolled gages. This material, named GM 980X, could significantly increase the use of 980X steels in automotive applications. Two commercially available 980X steels were eval- uated in this study; one was vanadium strengthened and the other titanium strengthened. The vanadium steel appears to be better suited for this process than the titanium steel. Probable mechanisms for the observed changes in properties and the reasons for the different response of the two steels are suggested. 1976 SA E Transactions 760207. High-Strength Steel for Cost Effective Weight Reduction. S. Dinda, R. W. Karry and A. S. Kasper, Materials Engineering Chrysler Cor- poration. Substitution of high-strength steels for low-carbon steels in automotive components to control spira ling weight 45</page><page sequence="33">760208-760213 increases in recent years is discussed. Material design interacting parameters are considered for efficient utili- zation of these materials. The economic justification for material substitution in terms of strength levels and grades are discussed in detail. Significant stamping experience in forming these materials for Lightweight Charger XL is presented in this paper. Examples of formed parts are shown and die modifications associated in forming some of the parts are also outlined. 760208. A New Concept in Formable High Strength Steel. S. J. Donachie, International Nickel Co., Inc. A new approach to forming high strength steels is proposed and its feasibility demonstrated. The proposed method involves a relationship between steel composition and heat treatment which allows specific steels to be formed at low strength levels and subsequently streng- thened, without distortion, by a martensitic transforma- tion. The steel chosen to demonstrate the concept could be formed at 40 ksi yield strength and subsequently strengthened by a short heat treatment to yield strangths in excess of 100 ksi. 760209. High Strain Rate Behavior of Some Hot and Cold Rolled Low Carbon Steels. Ashok Saxena and David A. Chatfield, National Steel Corp. The high strain rate behavior of three types of low carbon steel has been investigated in the strain rate regime of .006-100 sec"1. These types included hot and/or cold rolled (i) rimmed steels, (ii) aluminum killed steels and (iii) high strength low alloy steels with various combinations of cold rolling and aging treatments. The tensile properties reported at four strain rates in the above range are yield strength, tensile strength, uniform and total elongation, strain hardening exponent and strength coefficient. Strain rate hardening exponent at several strain levels is also reported. New experimental techniques are discussed. The results are presented in tabular form and are discussed with representative graphs. In general, strength increases and ductility decreases with increasing strain rate. It is observed that the strain rate hardening exponent appears to depend only on the static flow stress of the material and is independent of the strengthening mechanism used to achieve the strength within the domain of the materials tested. The data are briefly discussed in light of some models and mechanisms that are taken from the literature. 1976 SA E Transactions 760210. Diesel Vehicles ?- Crude Oil Scene. O. A. Uyehara, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, at University of Wisconsin, Madison. It is well recognized that the idling and part load fuel economy of diesel engines are better than throttled controlled spark ignition gasoline engines. Using well known principles the explanations for the difference are presented. Fuel consumption rate for similar engines and mileage for similar weight vehicles are presented in graphical form. Trends of demand, supply and reserve of crude oil for the World and the United States are shown in graphical form. Future supply scenario of crude oil is presented. The cost of making synthetic crude from coal is very roughly predicted. 760211. Approaches to Low Emission Levels for Light- Duty Diesel Vehicles. M. Amano, H. Sami, S. Nakagawa and H. Yoshizaki, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Approaches to low emission levels for a light-duty diesel vehicle were studied according to the 1975 FTP using a Toyota Land Cruiser which is in the 4,000 lb inertia weight class, equipped with a Toyota model B diesel engine, 4-stroke, 4-cylinder and 3-liter displacement with a swirl chamber. A simulation method, which is based on an emission map measured in steady state, was developed and proven to be very useful for an efficient study on the effects of various vehicle design factors. The attainable emission levels of smaller diesel passenger cars were also estimated using this method. It is concluded that the primary target of HC 0.41, CO 3.4, NOx 1.0 g/mile could be achieved by engine modifications and appropriate transmission and final gear ratio choice for the 4,000 lb class vehicle with some penalty in power and fuel economy. However, the ultimate target of HC 0.41, CO 3.4, NOx 0.4 g/mile is impossible to be achieved for the 4,000 lb class vehicle and very difficult for smaller passenger cars, even if an EGR system and an oxidation catalyst are adopted. 1976 SA E Transactions 760212. A Series of Light Duty Indirect Injection Diesel Engines. Yutaka Hayashi, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. (Japan). The objective of this paper is to clarify the problems encountered with the installation of diesel engines in passenger cars and light duty commercial vehicles. As an example, Nissan Diesel's SD series light duty IDI engines are introduced. Described herein are the design concept, including determination of cylinder size, cylinder configuration and structure and function of the components particular to diesel operation. Output performance, fuel economy, exhaust emissions and noise are also described. Exhaust and noise emissions are yet to be improved. The critical acceptance factors of diesel passenger cars are discussed with special emphasis on fuel economy, noise, roughness and drivability. 760213. A Modification of Combustion Systems for Low Exhaust Emission and Its Effects on Durability of Prechamber Diesel Engine. Takashi Suzuki and Kozi Usami, Hino Motors, Ltd. (Japan). Described here is the tuning of the combustion systems of a precombustion chamber diesel engine for lower level of 46</page><page sequence="34">760214-760221 exhaust gas emission. The key points of the tuning are the decrease of the prechamber volume, the selection of the combustion chamber configuration, the injection nozzle characteristics and the optimum injection timing. It was made clear, in the results of investigation, that the degradation of lubricating oil and the cavitation pitting on the outer wall of cylinder liner were directly concerned with the combustion characteristics of low emission systems. And both problems have been solved. The result of combustion tuning of the engine shows less than 5 g/hp-h of NOx + HC with CARB 13 mode test cycle without deterioration of performance nor durability. Discussion: S.

Hiroshi Nakagawa and Mataji Tateishi, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Japan); and Masaaki Sekino, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (Japan). Recently diesel engines are required to get not only high performance but also low pollution gas quality (oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and smoke). Our approach to this requirement is based on the fuel spray theory that good fuel-air mixing in the fuel spray developed into the quiescent air depends upon high kinetic energy of the spray motion. From the theoretical analysis of fuel spray motion in the quiescent air and the photographic study of the fuel spray combustion, it was found that higher rate of air entrainment into the fuel spray by its own kinetic energy gives a very important effect on the increasing of combustion efficiency in the diesel engine and the reduction of soot formation. So, we designed the high volumetric efficiency but low swirl generating intake port in order to charge sufficient air into the cylinder, and an improved fuel injection system to attain high injection rate and high injection pressure so as to obtain high cycle efficiency and good fuel-air mixing in the quiescent air. As a result of many tests on this system using a single cylinder engine, a D.I. multi-cylinder diesel engine with high cycle efficiency and low smoke density was developed. The fuel injection timing of this engine is retarded to reduce the oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust gas. The fuel injector and fuel injection timing at light loads are improved to reduce the hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas. 1976 SA E Transactions 760215. The Combustion and Exhaust Emission Char- acteristics and Starting Ability of Y.P.C. Com- bustion System. Eiichi Motoyoshi, Tadashi Yamada and Mitsuyoshi Mori, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. (Japan). The results of the experiments carried out by changing the factors of the combustion system in the course of the development of the unique combustion system (Y.P.C.) which Yanmar adopt in their small diesel engines are introduced. In order to obtain better starting ability with manual operation, the Y.P.C, is so designed that a part of fuel injected into the divided chamber can directly reach the main combustion chamber. For obtaining the highest efficiency, it is necessary to examine the form in addition to the volume ratio, the throat area ratio and so on. Excellent combustion characteristics were obtained with comparatively low exhaust emission by optimizing these factors. The Y.P.C, has the flexibility to various kinds of fuel and the low combustion noise level. 1976 SA E Transactions 760216. Systems and Hardware Effects of FMVSS 105- 75. Carl Ballard and Ron Andrade, Ford Motor Company. FMVSS 105 was a modification of the former SAE voluntary standard and was useful as one of a number of test procedures required to establish the acceptability of a brake system. The subsequent FMVSS 105-75 established criteria which do not appear to correlate to the real world, and adequate brake system design still depends on the integrity of manufacturers and engineers. FMVSS 105-75 has created compliance problems, has increased vehicle costs, and has been of marginal benefit to the customer. 760217. A Critical Review of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 105. Rudolf Limpert, University of Utah. The purpose of this paper is to outline and analyze the functions of a braking system, to review the elements of an objective and meaningful braking standard, to evaluate Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 105-74, and to recommend revisions to FMVSS 105-75. 760219. Hydraulic Brake System U.S. versus Common Market. U. W. Seiffert, H.-G. Marks and K.-H. Zi wica, Volkswagenwerk AG. Two hydraulic brake system regulations, the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 105-75 and the European Economic Community Directive 71/320/EEC with its respective amendments, became effective with the intro- duction of 1976 model year passenger cars. This paper highlights some of the most difficult requirements in terms of braking stability and stopping distances a passenger car has to meet in the U.S. and Europe. Further, it shows the impact these two regulations have on the brake system layout in the U.S. and Europe. For that purpose a specific vehicle model, the Volkswagen Rabbit, is used to demonstrate the brake systems layout. Since international standard unification is of major importance, some suggestions are made to achieve this goal with a minimum of cost and optimum brake system performance without sacrifice in safety. 1976 SAE Transactions 760221. Comparison of Low Temperature Testing Tech- niques for Elastomer Specifications. William J. 47</page><page sequence="35">760223 - 760226 Snoddon, Yale Rubber Mfg. Co. It is frequently necessary to specify low-temperature requirements for vulcanized rubber. This is commonly accomplished by establishing minimum values using the line call-out procedures of SAE J200 - ASTM D 2000. Resistance to impact at a low temperature is determined on specimens die cut from test slabs and tested per ASTM D 2137. Due to a considerable variation in results the Com- mittee on Automotive Rubber Specifications decided to investigate the precision of D 2137 and, concurrently, alternate procedures which could be included in SAE J200 - ASTM D 2000. Test results are presented showing repeatability and reproducibility for ASTM D 2137, D 1053 and D 1329. To a lesser extent data are shown on glass transition temperature measurements. 760223. Pattern Recognition as a Quality Control Tool with Applications to Rubber and Plastics. C. F. Holmes and H. T. McAdams, Calspan Corp. The use of pattern-recognition principles is advanced as an approach to quality assurance in those numerous cases in which quality resides not in a single attribute but in a complex relationship among a number of variables. A key element in the approach is the identification of critical parameters, or features, which determine quality. Once isolated, these features can then be combined into quality indices or "signatures" capable of differentiating between acceptable or unacceptable product, even in cases in which the individual features seem to bear little relation to quality. Pattern recognition is thus seen as an adjunct to advanced testing techniques, which are effective only to the extent that the information derived therefrom can be related to the factors which determine quality. Algorithms for implementing a pattern-recognition approach to quality are discussed and are shown to be non-prohibitive in either complexity or cost. How surface geometry features affect the performance of an elastomer as a seal is cited as an example of the benefits which can be realized from the pattern-recog- nition approach. It is shown that, in general, surface geometry must be characterized in terms appropriate to the function to be served by the surface, and this fact necessitates a multiple-parameter description of the surface rather than the classical single-parameter descrip- tion in such terms as AA or RMS roughness. Other applications of pattern-recognition techniques to quality control are discussed. 760224. Izod Impact-Does It Really Mean Impact? R. J. Welgos and E. C. Caughey, Allied Chemical Corp. Notched Izod Impact has been accepted for purposes of reporting impact resistance for plastic material. It has been shown that these reported values can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the real impact of plastic materials, due to the morphological and visco-elastic differences between polymers. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the inherent shortcomings of the notched Izod tests. 760225. A Spark Ignition, Lean-Homogeneous Combus- tion, Engine Emission Control System for a Small Vehicle. Donald J. Pozniak, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Theoretically, the combustion of homogeneous, lean air-fuel mixtures offers potentially low emissions with low fuel consumption. An experimental investigation of a lean-combustion engine system, equipped with a lean thermal reactor, was conducted with a 1130 kg (2500 lb) vehicle. The effects of spark timing on vehicle emissions, fuel consumption, and lean reactor performance were determined. Retarded spark timing decreased HC and CO emis- sions, did not affect NOx emissions, and increased fuel consumption. Over-advanced spark timing decreased CO emissions, increased HC and NOx emissions, and in- creased fuel consumption. The vehicle emission levels were very sensitive to spark timing changes and carburetor calibration repeatability. Thus, implementation of such a vehicle would require careful control of these engine variables. 760226. Emission Control With Lean Mixtures. John F. Schweikert and James J. Gumbleton, Advance Product Engineering, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. NOx emissions can be controlled through engine opera- tions with lean homogeneous air/fuel mixtures. This emission control approach precludes the need for exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and secondary air injection systems. The Lean Mixture concept results in similar emissions, fuel economy, and driveability when compared to EGR systems tailored to similar emission levels with similar aftertreatment systems. The Lean Mixture ap- proach does offer the potential for less engine emission control hardware. The minimum NOx level achieved experimentally at the lean driveability limit was about 1.2 g/mi but with significantly higher HC emissions. Lean Mixture systems are sensitive to variations in engine air/fuel ratio which produce a significant effect on their emissions and fuel economy. Due to this sensitivity, it appears that the Lean Mixture concept is limited to the current NOx emission standards (3.1 g/mi) unless technological advances in fuel/air metering occur that reduce engine and carburetor air/fuel ratio variations. Vehicle programs have demonstrated the effect of lean engine air/fuel ratios on base emissions and fuel economy as well as in conjunction with various aftertreatment systems; oxidizing catalytic converters, and lean manifold reactors. Lean Mixture systems are not compatible with reducing catalysts. A Lean Mixture-Manifold Reactor emission control system was used to evaluate the effect of compression ratio and leaded fuel on vehicle emissions and fuel 48</page><page sequence="36">760227 - 760234 economy. With the constraint of equal HC emission levels, the classical relationship between compression ratio and fuel economy appears to have been altered. The use of higher compression ratio did not result in improved fuel economy. In addition, the use of leaded fuels resulted in both a direct and a long term increase in HC emissions. System durability is shown for a Lean Mixture- Catalytic Converter system with lead-free fuel and for a Lean Mixture system without aftertreatment with leaded fuel. An engine dynamometer program demonstrated the incentive for improved mixture distribution. 1976 SA E Transactions 760227. Emissions, Fuel Economy, and Durability of Lean Burn Systems. W. E. Adams, F. J. Marsee, R. M. Olree and J. C. Hamilton, Ethyl Corporation. Several makes and models of cars were modified for lean-burn operation using the Turbulent Flow Manifold (TFM), a unique intake manifold that provides improved preparation and distribution of the fuel-air mixture. Operation of the TFM is described, and exhaust emissions and fuel economy data are presented for the various cars. Exhaust port liners and thermal reactors were shown to be effective devices for reducing emissions from the basic lean-burn system. One car equipped with the TFM, port liners, and reactors was operated for 50,000 miles on an EPA-type durability test and had emissions well below the 1975 standards for California. Emissions, fuel econ- omy, and durability data are presented. 760228. Corrosion Testing of Chromium Plated Alumi- num Bumper Bar Stock. J. C. Jongkind, M &amp; T Chemicals, Inc. The paper describes the behavior of Cu-Ni-Cr plated aluminum bumper bar stock of Alloy X7046 in a number of accelerated and atmospheric corrosion tests. Three different pre-plate procedures with several combinations of Cu-Ni-Cr were tested. The preferred combinations of pre-plate and top coating showed results equal to steel plated bumpers of commercial quality. 760230. The Utilization of Plasma-Deposited Coatings on Aluminum. R. C. Tucker, Jr., Linde Div., Union Carbide Corp. Plasma deposited ceramic, cermet and metallic coatings on aluminum substrates offer all the weight saving and other advantages of aluminum components with the additional benefits of surfaces tailored to meet the unique wear, frictional, thermal, and/or other requirements in a particular application. The successful utilization of such coatings, however, requires, in addition to a knowledge of the coatings desired characteristics, an understanding of the mechanical properties of the coatings and their interaction with the substrate. These properties are dependent on the microstructure of the coatings and the conditions of deposition. A discussion of these points is followed by several examples of the use of coatings on aluminum alloys in the automotive industry. 1976 SA E Transactions 760231. Long Range Aluminum Availability. Yeshwant P. Telang, Ford Motor Co. A study is made of U.S. and worldwide aluminum supply /demand and issues which led to shortages of the recent past. Key economic factors and their impact on future availability of aluminum are discussed by con- structing possible scenarios. 760232. The VIN in State Vehicle Registration and Records. George O. Stevens, Michigan Dept. of State. The ability of a motor vehicle agency's record-keeping system to provide effective service to the motoring public and to the variety of other public and private interests seeking access to information contained in that system is heavily dependent upon the accuracy with which vehicle identification numbers (VIN's) can be entered on that system and the completeness of a given VIN format in describing a particular vehicle. Standardization of the VIN format would facilitate the extensive governmental and commercial uses of VIN's and VIN -related infor- mation. 760233. The VIN in Vehicle Security and Theft Recovery. Robert F. Campbell, National Automobile Theft Bureau. With automobile theft approaching one million annually in this country, automobile manufacturers are realizing the importance of the vehicle identification number in combating this crime. Even though commercial auto thieves use sophisticated techniques to falsify the VIN's on stolen vehicles, voluntary and required procedures are currently being employed by the manufacturers to counter these actions. Secondary and confidential markings can now provide the law enforcement agent with another tool to make positive identification of a suspect stolen vehicle. The VIN is still the only legal identification accepted in the courts to prove rightful ownership of a motor vehicle in this country. 760234. The VIN in Industry and Its International Application. D. R. Wolfslayer, Chrysler Corp. There is a major problem in maintaining the records of the more than 275 million vehicles presently registered throughout the world. Monitoring the life of a given vehicle from its fabrication to its destruction can best be accomplished by the inner facing of major computer programs and a uniform system for vehicle identification. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is the legal identification of the vehicle. Every manufacturer has the responsibility of assigning a unique VIN to each vehicle, in compliance with numerous procedures, standards and laws. The VIN is attached to the vehicle, stamped and embossed on components, and printed on tamper resistant labels. It is printed on hundreds of documents and maintained in numerous files. The identification of vehicles is of international concern and the International Standards Organization 49</page><page sequence="37">760235 - 760241 (ISO) has recently approved standards dealing with the content, structure, and display of a uniform worldwide vehicle identification numbering system. 760235. Silicone Elastomers for Automotive Electronic Applications. Daryl D. Dickson, Jr., Dow Corn- ing Corp. Silicone elastomers are soft, flexible materials which are employed in automotive electronics applications to im- prove packaging reliability. Their physical and electrical properties are stable over a wide range of temperature and humidity conditions. However, the selection of the best elastomer for a particular application is complicated somewhat by the wide variety of formulations now available to the designer. This paper will present an overview of the field of silicone elastomers, starting from the types of cure systems now available. Cure systems form natural group- ings for selection purposes. Applications are discussed, and four recent products are highlighted. 760236. Polyurethanes: A Different Breed of Electrical and Electronic Insulating Materials. Thomas S. Simon, Jr., Hysol Div. Dexter Corp. New developments in aliphatic diisocy anate technology are producing polyurethane casting and potting ela- stomers that are competitive with epoxies and silicones for the dielectric insulation of electrical and electronic solid state systems in the modern automobile. 760237. Shock Resistant Epoxies for Use at Higher Under-the-Hood Temperatures. Justin C. Bolger, Amicon Corp. This paper reviews the methods currently used to improve the shock resistance of heat resistant epoxy adhesives and insulation compounds. These methods include the addi- tion of asbestos, glass fibers and other fillers, the incorporation of polyurethanes, nitrile rubbers and other elastomers, and the use of chain extending latent curing agents. New experimental data are also presented for a series of flexible, anhydride-cured, epoxy insulation compounds showing that it is now possible to combine improved shock resistance with long term thermal and hydrolytic stability by proper selection of the polyester flexibilizer and by avoiding the strongly basic amine accelerators used in the past. 1976 SA E Transactions 760238. Ceramics in the ERDA Highway Vehicle Heat Engine Systems Program. Robert B. Schultz, U.S. Energy Research and Development Ad- ministration. High temperature ceramic materials are expected to play a major role in the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) Highway Vehicle Heat Engine Systems Program to develop advanced gas turbine and Stirling engines. The development of corrosion resistant and reliable regenerator heat exchangers will be contin- ued, but with renewed emphasis on improving the effectiveness and operating temperature capability. New structural ceramic technology programs will be initiated by ERDA to test current materials and components to 3500 hours, and to develop new materials and fabrication methods for critical turbine and Stirling engine com- ponents. 760239. The Ceramic Gas Turbine - A Candidate Power- plant for the Middle-and Long-Term Future. A. F. McLean and D. A. Davis, Ford Motor Co. The paper reviews our problems of energy availability in the middle and long-term future as well as our problems of environmental pollution and materials availability. Against this background the ceramic gas turbine engine is examined and shown to have potential as an attractive candidate powerplant for both the middle and long-term future. The paper reports on Ford's ceramic gas turbine program which is a systems development program encom- passing all aspects of turbine ceramics technology - de- sign, materials, fabrication processes, testing and evalu- ation. 1976 SA E Transactions 760240. Development of a Ceramic Blade-Superalloy Disk Attachment For Gas Turbine Rotors. Bryant H. Walker and William D. Carruthers, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. With improving ceramic materials and fabrication tech- niques, a major effort is underway to design and test ceramic hot flow path components for gas turbine engines. The most critical and furthest from a satisfactory engineering solution is the turbine rotor. This paper summarizes the development of a new technique for attaching hot pressed silicon nitride ceramic airfoil shapes to a wrought AF2-1DA superalloy disk using the GATORIZING™ isothermal forging process. Attachment design, fabrication and testing techniques are discussed leading to the establishment of a 99.5 percent statistical lower bound P/A blade stress of 20.5 ksi (141 MN/m2). Subsequent elevated temperature attachment develop- ment techniques for establishing design criteria for operation in the gas turbine environment are also defined. 760241. Optimum Design of a Ceramic Turbine Wheel. J. Tomas, Volks wagenwerk AG (Germany). Optimum turbine wheel geometry for passenger car gas turbine has been calculated for two ceramic materials: hot pressed silicon nitride and densified silicon carbide. Two iterative strategies, coupling the mathematical program- ming techniques with methods of finite elements and finite differences, were used for finding the disk with minimum failure probability. The influences of mean strength, Weibull modulus, and the disk form on the failure probability are presented. The results distinctly show that an improvement in material quality is necessary if the ceramic gas turbine wheel is to become a dependable component. 1976 SA E Transactions 50</page><page sequence="38">760242 - 760247 760242. The Electronic Control Unit for Production Electronic Fuel Injection Systems. J. G. Rivard, Bendix Electronics and Engine Control Systems Group. This paper presents a functional description of the 1975 production Electronic Fuel Injection system, relating system performance to automobile performance require- ments. It addresses in particular the architecture and physical design of the heart of the system, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Accuracy requirements and envi- ronmental and durability constraints imposed on ECU design are discussed. The extensive on-line testing that must be performed to ensure necessary levels of accuracy on a cost-effective basis and at through-put rates consis- tent with automotive production scheduling is shown to have presented a major manufacturing challenge. Design modifications expected to result from present and antic- ipated technological advances are overviewed. 760243. Automatic Computer-Controlled Calibration of EFI Control Units. J. H. Schlag, Systems In- struments Research, Inc. Calibration testing of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a sophisticated analog computer which controls injector operation in the recently introduced domestic-passenger- car Electronic Fuel Injection system, is accomplished at a series of test stations equipped with specially designed, computer-controlled Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). This paper outlines the overall test sequence to which an ECU is subjected following manufacture, and then describes in detail the design logic, hardware, and software associated with the two ATE systems used. Particular emphasis is given to the Trim Station ATE, which not only performs complete functional testing but also computes optimum values for 28 resistors incor- porated into the circuit at this stage to optimize circuit performance. These values are transmitted to the Laser Trimmer, which cuts individualized resistance modules for each ECU. After module insertion, the ECU is retested, packaged, and final-tested. The identical Second Test Station and Final Test Station ATE systems are elec- trically similar to the Trim ATE but have no resistance- optimizing capability and are fixtured to accommodate up to ten units at a time. 1976 SA E Transactions 760244. The EFI-Control-Unit Final Test Station. C. J. Ahern, J. H. Tarter and W. G. Wolber, Bendix Research Labs.; and G. T. Bata, Bendix Elec- tronics and Engine Control Systems Group. Electronic engine control has recently been introduced as standard equipment on a domestic passenger car in the form of the Bendix Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system. This system is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a sophisticated electronics package the mass production of which required the development of special-process test equipment capable of ensuring nec- essary levels of performance, throughput, reliability, and maintainability. This paper details the development of one part of the overall test facility, the Final Test Station. The Test Station accepts control units at several stages of production completion and applies to them simulated manifold-vacuum pressures in a computer-directed se- quence. The 100-torr (13-kilopascal) pressure steps prop- agate pressure surges of less than 0.2 torr (26 pascals) back to the source tanks; total system settling time is 0.6 second or less. The station is both highly reliable and easily maintainable, and was human-engineered for the efficient manual loading and unloading of test units. It has reduced per-unit test time by more than 50 percent and has increased shift production to levels that permit us to meet passenger-car requirements. 760245. A Precision Pressure-Source System for EFI- Control-Unit Calibration and Test. W. G. Wolber, G. T. Bata, C. V. David, B. Gollomp and P. R. Kudlatý, Bendix Corp. Simulating manifold absolute pressure for the calibration and test of domestic Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) controls demanded an absolute-pressure-source-system stability, accuracy, and speed of response not previously required for automotive-component manufacture. A 36- point pressure source having a root-mean-square stability of ±0.002 pound per square inch (±13 pascals) absolute, an accuracy of better than ± 0.002 pound per square inch (±13 pascals) absolute, and a response time of 500 milliseconds into a 1 -cubic-inch (16-cubic-centimeter) switched volume was developed to meet this need. Source-system design drew heavily on aircraft flight- line-check- out test-equipment experience. The system is used for 100 percent production calibration and test of EFI Electronic Control Units. 760246. An On-Line Pressure Monitor for EFI-Control- Unit Test Diagnostics. A. E. Young, D. H. Locher and W. G. Wolber, Bendix Corp. This paper describes an on-line pressure-monitoring system, designed to meet an urgent need for constant accuracy surveillance on the precision pressures that are applied to EFI Electronic Control Units during produc- tion calibration and test. Design requirements and approach are discussed, and system implementation and performance are detailed. The Pressure Monitor, which operates in both a SCAN and a SET mode, detects and measures pressure deviations in up to 39 precision pressure sources, and activates an alarm to alert test personnel should an out-of-tolerance condition develop. It has significantly reduced the incidence of test-operator error, and has played a major role in substantially increasing production yields. 760247. Automatic Testing of Pressure Transducers for Fuel Injection Systems. C. A. Mounteer and L. M. Lockie, Jr., Servonic/Instrumentation Div., Guitón Industries, Inc. A unique system has been developed for evaluating the 51</page><page sequence="39">760251 -760259 performance of large numbers of pressure transducers with minimal operator interaction. The system imple- ments the determination of zero-set, slope, linearity, and temperature coefficient, and prints out the raw data-as well as a histogram-at the end of each 200-unit run, with out-of-tolerance conditions annotated. Such a run, on the present test line, requires approximately 3.5 to 4 hours, most of which is spent bringing the units to the specified test temperatures. 760251. Personal Rapid Transit-Human and Environmen- tal Synthesis. W. H. Gollwitzer, Ford Motor Co. The Ford Motor Company's automatically controlled transportation system now installed in the Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn, Michigan and Bradley International Airport, Hartford, Connecticut, represent a coming together of a host of proven technical disciplines which form a mode of transportation that can move people effectively and efficiently within a confined urban setting. This paper reviews the design parameters of Ford's automatically controlled transportation (ACT) from the viewpoint of the traveling passenger and from the visual impact the system has on the surrounding environment in which it must live. 760253. A Construction Truck Front Tandem Suspension with One Driving Axle. Robert W. Stieg, Mack Trucks, Inc. This paper describes the design requirements and our solutions for a heavy-duty tandem steering axle suspen- sion, and the related special 8x6 construction truck chassis. By restricting the tandem axle load equalization to the maximum legal load range only, it was possible to design a suspension using individual axle mountings. This mounting achieved substantial benefits in weight, per- formance, cost, and development time over an equalizing beam type suspension as applied to a vehicle front end. In addition, the design incorporates a variable front axle load distribution feature, which increases empty vehicle and off-highway mobility by allowing a temporary biasing of weight to the front driving axle. Consequently, the concept is particularly well suited to a front tandem with only one axle driving. Also described are experimental automatic control variations, unsuccessful and otherwise, that led to the final development. 760254. Front Tandem Torsion Bar Suspension for Non- Driving Axles. Svein Ellingsen, Kenworth Truck Co. In 1972 a new truck weight law in Quebec and Ontario, Canada allowed 80,000 lbs. and 76,000 lbs. G.V.W. divided evenly on four axles, giving 20,000 lbs. or 19,000 lbs. per axle. In order to take advantage of this law, Kenworth Truck Company developed a tandem front axle suspension using torsion bars as the suspension element. To steer the axles, dual integral power steering gears were chosen. A brief description of the steering setup will also be given in this paper. 760255. Lightweight Brake System. Jere S. Culp, Kelsey Hayes Co. A light weight hydraulic disc brake system, featuring several innovations, has been developed for on highway, recreational vehicle use. The system uses aluminum components for the major structural members of the brake and master cylinder. A plastic master cylinder piston is used. The brake system uses a stamped steel rotor and metallic friction materials. The components of the system have passed life cycle, environmental and vibration tests, which were based on Kelsey-Hayes test requirements for the automotive industry. 760257. Twin Disc Brake Rotor. Robert S. McKee, McKee Engineering; and Robert E. Luetje, Armco Steel Corp. Steel disc brake rotors have been evaluated by many in an effort to overcome foundry capacity problems, realize possible design advantages and improve performance. The twin disc rotor discussed in this paper is a novel design which makes higher energy absorption rates possible. The fins of a conventional rotor are replaced by a double faced pad which doubles lining area without modification of the caliper, wheel or other hardware. 760258. The Phenolic Disc Brake Piston. J. M. Knoll, Chrysler Corporation; and J. E. Emmett, Durez Div.-Hooker Chemical. Molded phenolic disc brake pistons were released as an alternate to the chrome plated steel piston on 1975 Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Imperials. This unique use of a non-metallic thermoset material is the result of a joint Chrysler/Durez material and design development program. The combined efforts of the material supplier, molder and end user made it possible to screen and formulate a material, establish a design, and select a process that would produce pistons to meet disc brake functional requirements. This paper describes how this was achieved with material and design. 1976 SA E Transactions 760259. Are Lightweight, Economic SMC Bumpers Just a Dream? Peter Peterson, Owens-Corning Fiber- glass Europe S.A. (Belgium). While European passenger cars are already being equipped with sheet molding compound (SMC) bumpers, a new high strength SMC material system named "Oriented Roving SMC" is introduced to expand further the use of SMC in this area. Bumpers made with conventional chopped roving SMC, continuous roving SMC and oriented roving SMC as well as with steel and aluminum were sled tested under various conditions and the results are compared, which indicate that SMC absorbs and stores a high amount of energy. Cost considerations and bumper design proposals are given together with an attempt to evaluate the future of SMC in bumper applications. 52</page><page sequence="40">760260 - 760267 760260. Factors Affecting Plastic for High-Volume Ex- terior Automotive Applications. Louis J. Chmura, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Currently, about 160 pounds of plastic are used in the average American Automobile. Exterior part applications account for approximately 20 pounds of the total. These applications are in use because the advantages of plastic more than offset the risks of utilizing a new material. The outlook for increasing use of plastics on the exterior has never been more favorable due to a combination of factors within the automotive and plastics industries. This paper examines these factors and concludes that plastics usage for high-volume exterior body applications will expand significantly in the next several years. These advancements will require substantial development effort by both industries. 760263. The New Trade-Offs in Engineering Materials Selection. Edward K. Gray and Roy W. McLeefe, Plastics Dept., E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. The paper outlines three emerging issues that are currently affecting material selection decisions throughout the world: ecology, increasing government regulations and consumerism, and the energy shortage. Contents of the paper explain and discuss an analysis regarding the need for automotive weight reduction and the concomitant effects of weight reduction on fuel economy. 760264. The Performance of a Multigap Spark Plug Designed for Automotive Applications. W. G. Rado, J. E. Amey, B. Bates and A. H. Turner, Ford Motor Co. The electrical principle of operation, the geometrical and electrical circuit constraints on the design of, and the electrical and in-engine performance of a multigap spark plug developed for automotive applications are described. The electrical principle of operation is based on successively breaking down an array of spark gaps through the use of a resistive ladder network. The measurements evaluating the electrical perform- ance of various multigap designs indicate that these plugs can deliver up to twice the energy of a single gap plug to the arcs, using the same ignition system. The increased amount of energy is also delivered in a shorter time than for single gap plugs. The measurements evaluating the in-engine perform- ance of these plugs further indicate that improvements of up to 6% in fuel economy for a simulated CVS test run, the extension of the lean misfire limit by several A/F ratio numbers under various engine operating conditions, and improvements in driveability can be achieved compared to the performance of standard plugs under the same operating conditions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760265. Digital Electronic Spark Advance Systems. Hans- joerg Manger, Robert Bosch GmbH (West Germany). In view of emission regulations and other requirements, maintenance-free ignition systems with sophisticated advance characteristics of high accuracy and stability are of great interest. Although recently introduced transis- torized ignition systems with breakerless pick-up systems have improved the situation significantly, there is still need for improvements as regards to 1. Introduction of further parameters controlling the advance characteristic in addition to speed and load, i.e. temperature. 2. Higher complexity of advance curves. 3. No changes in timing due to wear of mechanical parts of the advance mechanism. 4. Increased accuracy of timing by pick-up at flywheel. The paper describes the features of digital spark advance systems which offer the above mentioned advantages. It deals with three different systems, i.e.: 1. Special purpose computer with integrated data memory. 2. Special purpose computer with separate data memory, that is also accessible for other systems. 3. Special purpose computer without any memory. The characteristics of these systems are discussed. 760266. The Ferroresonant Capacitor Discharge Ignition (FCDI) System: A Multiple Firing CD Ignition with Spark Discharge Sustaining Between Fir- ings. Joseph R. Asik and Bradford Bates, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Emission control requirements and the desire for im- proved fuel economy have led to many studies concerned with improving combustion chamber design, fuel meter- ing, and ignition. This paper describes an experimental programmable ignition system based on a new principle of operation. The ignition system provides for electronically controlled changes in spark duration, spark current level, and restriking rate. The ignition system also combines a very fast risetime with a controlled duration. Extensive multicylinder engine dynamometer test data are presented which indicate that improved ignition can be of benefit at marginal engine operating points. 1976 SA E Transactions 760267. Evaluation of a Butadiene-Styrene Viscosity Index Improver. W. L. Streets, K. H. Yochum and Bill Mitacek, Phillips Petroleum Co. Extensive laboratory and field test data are presented on multigrade motor oils formulated with a new VI improver developed by Phillips Petroleum Company. This VI improver is a hydrogenated copolymer of butadiene and styrene. Its unique features are outstanding shear and oxidation stability, and excellent performance in Cater- pillar 1-H diesel tests. Attention is focused not only on the unique features but on its overall performance in multi- 53</page><page sequence="41">760268 - 760275 graded oils. Although this VI improver was originally developed for passenger car multigrade oils, data are present to show application in truck multigrade oils, high VI hydraulic oils, automatic transmission fluids, farm tractor hydraulic fluids, and use as a VI improver and thickener in several synthetic oils. 760268. Cranking and Pumpability Characteristics of Multigrade Mineral and Synthetic Engine Oils. C. R. Spohn and R. M. Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. The hot and cold engine cranking performances of seven multigrade synthetic engine oils are compared to those of one multigrade and four single grade mineral oils. In addition, the low temperature pumpability characteristics of these oils are compared. The results indicate that a synthetic engine oil can be formulated which is superior to current mineral oil blends under both high and low temperature conditions. 760269/ The Effect of Polymers in Multigrade Lubricating Oils on Engine Wear. P. Neudörfl, Roehm GmbH (Germany). A survey is given for the parameters affecting the wear protecting properties of polymers in multigrade oils, the parameters being concentration, molecular weight and solubility properties of the polymers. Road and engine tests demonstrate that the main factor is polymer content, disregarding the chemistry of the polymer. 760270. Field Performance of Diesel Engine Oils. R. Overton, D. E. Steere and L. R. Carey, Imperial Oil Enterprises, Ltd. As a result of diesel engine failures being experienced in the field with "approved" engine oils, an extensive truck field test has been run with over 40 different oil formulations ranging in quality from CA to CD/SE/1% ash in four major types of diesel engines. Results show that fire-ring sticking is the major problem with a trunk piston 2-cycle engine and this appears to be related to the additive composition rather than the oil classification level. An examination of the groove deposits shows that ring sticking is the result of rapid ash build-up in the fire-ring groove under severe operating conditions. A crosshead piston/keystone ring combination has eliminated the ring sticking problem with this engine even though the two piston types build up similar deposit levels. A 10W/30 multigrade oil gives excellent performance in the crosshead piston 2-cycle engine. A major type of four-cycle engine gives satisfactory performance with oils ranging in quality from CC/SC to CD/SE, although the higher dispersant SE quality oils do give lower groove fill and cleaner overall engine condition. The 10W/30 multigrade oil gives excellent performance in this engine and in fact shows a definite benefit with regard to bearing wear. Two further types of four-cycle engines have been shown to give excellent performance with a Universal oil and with a 10W/30 multigrade oil using 16-18M mile oil change intervals. 760271. The Effect of Polymer Type Upon Performance of Multigrade Oils in Petrol and Diesel Engines. U. Schödel, Roehm GmbH (Germany).

Interesting properties in one area are not necessarily an indication of satisfactory performance in others. Selection of different polymers appears necessary for diesel and petrol engine lubricants. 760272. Needed: A Systems Approach to Electromagnetic Compatibility. A. C. Doty, Jr., Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. A proliferation of devices which emit incidental radiation capable of degrading the performance of radio receivers is leading toward a new dimension of federal regulation in the United States. Unacceptable degradation can usually be prevented either by controlling the incidental radiation, or by receiver circuitry that minimizes its effects. To protect the consumer-who ultimately pays the bill for regulation-interference caused by incidental radiation devices must be considered on a systems basis, and control applied in a method that provides maximum benefit for the costs incurred. 760273. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Measure- ments for Automotive Applications. J. W. Ad- ams, M. L. Crawford and J. F. Shafer, Natl. Bureau of Standards. This paper discusses present electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurement techniques and some of the problems associated with EMI measurements, especially relative to automotive problems. Improved measurement techniques are then discussed, including: 1) use of isotropic probes capable of measuring unperturbed, complex fields close to their sources and 2) transverse electromagnetic transmis- sion cells with expanded applications for both suscep- tibility and emission measurements. Finally, some sug- gestions for minimizing automotive EMI problems are given. 760275. The Electromagnetic Spectrum, A Limited Re- source, and Its Management.

Many existing forces are counterproductive to the orderly maintenance and further development of this natural resource. Short-term considerations play a great role in obscuring the ideal development of the spectrum, while the lack on the part of spectrum users and managers to harmonize our efforts to a higher degree results in much redundant activity. Although many different directions in our research initially are beneficial and even necessary, common denominators must be agreed to at an early stage. Development of measurement techniques in the field of immunity and determination of nuisance effect of different classes of man-made noise are good examples and it is here, internationally, that much needs to be done to arrive at practicable and modern solutions. 760276. Electromagnetic Radiation Regulation - Impact on a Manufacturer of Small Internal Combustion Engines. R. H. Lincoln and D. H. Wood, Outboard Marine Corp. Regulations and Standards dealing with control of Electromagnetic Radiation have predictable effects on design, cost, complexity, performance and consumer acceptance of small, internal combustion engine-driven products. These effects, as they relate to the manufacturer, as well as to the consumer, the taxpayer, and the regulator, are discussed. Also considered is the need for EMR regulation, and whether imposing specific controls on all small IC engines, regardless of their applications and usage, will meet that need in the "real world." 760277. Reducing Impulse Noise in CB Transceivers. John W. Foster, E.F. Johnson Co. Techniques used for reducing electrical impulse noise in two-way amplitude modulated (AM) radio equipment, as they apply to the design of transceivers used in the Class D Citizens Radio Service at 27 Megahertz (MHz), are described. Costs to the customer are given for these various techniques. 760279. The ERDA/Chrysler Upgraded Gas Turbine Engine Objectives and Design. G. A. Ball and J. I. Gumaer, Chrysler Corporation; and T. M. Sebestyen, ERDA. Under a contract which began in November 1972, Chrysler Corporation has been conducting an automotive gas turbine improvement program for the Division of Transportation of the Energy Research and Development Administration. The final task of this program is to design, build, and demonstrate an Upgraded Engine. The design has been accomplished and is described in this paper. It utilizes a number of improvements developed and verified on the Chrysler Sixth Generation "Baseline" engines, e.g. variable inlet guide vanes, water injection, ceramic regenerators, an integrated electronic control system, a free-rotor arrangement, a low emissions fixed geometry burner, and linerless insulation. Aerodynamic details to meet higher efficiency component specifications were provided by NASA Lewis. The design also incor- porates a gas bearing on the rotor and improvements in arrangement and mechanical design. A vehicle system incorporating this engine should operate with fuel econ- omy double that of the Baseline engine system and demonstrate emissions levels within the current 1978 Federal Standards. 760280. Upgrading Automotive Gas Turbine Technology, An Experimental Evaluation of Improvement Concepts. Peter R. Angeli and Thomas Golec, Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler's development of an automotive gas turbine engine which will meet the current 1978 Federal Emis- sions Standards and have performance reliability and potential manufacturing costs compatible to present production powerplants is described and the design of the baseline vehicle being developed in conjunction with it is also discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760282. The Application of Chemical Vapor Deposited Silicon Carbide to Radial Turbomachinery. Richard E. Engdahl, Deposits &amp; Composites, Inc. Radial turbines have significant advantage over axial flow machines, particularly in the small sizes because of their greater stage-work capacity at higher efficiencies. To fully realize this potential, it will be necessary to develop a ceramic radial rotor capable of withstanding the severe temperatures and stresses normally encountered in a gas turbine application. This paper presents such a rotor design and the progress to date toward fabricating the component in chemical vapor deposited silicon carbide (CVD SiC). The analysis shows that even the best current material is just good enough for the simplest type turbine rotor. Thus, it is important to develop a rotor material with the potential for evolving to meet the higher performance requirements of future gas turbines. CVD SiC was selected because it is the strongest material known at the operating temperature and has the greatest potential for significant improvement. 760283. Variable Geometry Compressors for Improvement of Gas Turbine Part Load Performance. G. M. Shulhan, National Research Council of Canada; and H. I. H. Saravanamuttoo, Carle ton Uni- versity (Canada). The variable geometry compressor has been studied to determine if it can offer the prospect of a solution to the part load performance problem which is mechanically simpler and hence less expensive than current modifi- cations. The two most common modifications of this type are the variable geometry turbine and General Motors' Power Transfer scheme. The former is the better known, but the latter has been gaining acceptance and may now 55</page><page sequence="43">760285 - 760290 indeed have more potential than the variable geometry turbine. However, when one realizes that both these methods may become less attractive as turbine inlet temperatures are raised to improve performance, modi- fication at the cold end of the engine seems to present a reasonable alternative. The proposed variable geometry compressor cycle is designed around part load conditions, with maximum power being obtained by opening the guide vanes and increasing the rotational speed of the compressor. Al- though its performance is not competitive with current engines utilizing variable geometry turbines or Power Transfer, the variable geometry compressor does seem to offer increased potential as the trend towards higher turbine inlet temperatures continues. 760285. The Use of Variable Inlet Guide Vanes for Automotive Gas Turbine Engine Augmentation and Load Control. Ronald C. Pampreen, Chry- sler Corporation. This paper presents the results of the design and development work on variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) for use in the ERDA Upgraded Automotive Gas Turbine Engine. The feasibility of the concept of VIGV augmen- tation was carried out on ERDA Baseline engine hard- ware in compressor rig and complete engine testing. Included in the paper are discussions of this VIGV design philosophy, development logic and test results, and the critical areas of gas generator compressor and turbine matching combined with variable-nozzle power turbine and vehicle matching. 760286. An Approach to Altitude Compensation of the Carburetor. Richard C. Wrausmann and Robert J. Smith, Carter Carburetor Div., ACF Indus- tries, Inc. Carburetion and a number of other engine functions dependent on manifold vacuum are adversely affected at higher altitudes. This paper presents various approaches to compensate for this effect, discusses the rationale leading to the variable air bleed approach chosen by Carter Carburetor Division and reviews the significant features of the compensating device as developed. 760287. Closed Loop Control of Lean Fuel- Air Ratios Using a Temperature Compensated Zirconia Oxygen Sensor. M. Hubbard, University of California at Davis; and J. J. Bonilla, K. W. Randall and J. D. Powell, Stanford University. Several recent papers describe closed loop fuel-air ratio control systems designed to operate at stoichiometric conditions because of the high three-way catalyst con- version efficiencies which occur only in a narrow band around stoichiometric. This paper investigates closed loop control of fuel-air ratio using a temperature compensated zirconia sensor at other than stoichiometric conditions. If engines can be made to run at very lean (^&gt;^0.6-0.7) equivalence ratios through greater attention to proper fuel-air mixing and vaporization, CO, HC, and NOx emissions are minimized simultaneously. Closed loop control in the lean region makes the system insensitive to parameter variations and allows the fuel-air ratio to be maintained closer to the lean limit than would be possible under conventional open loop conditions. Assuming lean combustion and using the Nernst equation for the oxygen sensor, equations are derived relating equivalence ratio to the oxygen sensor output voltage and temperature. Equations are also derived and discussed which give the sensitivity of predicted equiv- alence ratio to measurement errors in voltage and temperature and to variations in humidity and exhaust pressure. A simplified calculation scheme, which involves a linearization in equivalence ratio and which might be used in an onboard computer, is presented and its accuracy is discussed. The theoretical results are verified using experimental data obtained on a CFR engine and a system is described which predicts and controls fuel-air ratio closed loop in the lean region based on oxygen sensor and thermocouple output voltages. 760288. A Vaporized Gasoline Metering System for Internal Combustion Engines. D. R. Hamburg and J. E. Hyland, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A prototype vaporized gasoline metering system is described which utilizes engine exhaust heat to vaporize liquid gasoline prior to being combined with inlet air. It is shown that the system (1) exhibits minimal time-fluc- tuations in air-fuel ratio, (2) essentially eliminates the transient variations in air-fuel ratio due to load changes, and (3) provides a very uniform cylinder-to-cylinder distribution of air-fuel ratio. The use of the vapor system at very lean air-fuel ratios is considered, and a CVS cycle prediction of the lean-limit operation is presented. 760289. Theoretical Studies of Fuel Droplet Evaporation and Transportation in a Carburetor Venturi. H. J. Yun and R. S. Lo, Ford Motor Company; and T. Y. Na, The University of Michigan, Dearborn Campus. Fuel droplets flowing in a carburetor venturi are analyzed by one-dimensional, steady, two-phase flow theories. Fuel evaporation and transportation are computed in terms of percent evaporation and droplet velocity, respectively. Among important parameters affecting droplet evapo- ration are droplet size, droplet temperature, and air temperature. Less significant parameters are air velocity and air pressure and air-fuel ratio. The mathematical model can be used to evaluate order-of-magnitude effects of various design parameters affecting fuel evaporation and droplet transportation in the carburetor and induc- tion system of an automotive engine. 760290. Frame Stress Considerations in Mounting Utility Man Lifts and Derricks. R. D. Rase, Omaha 56</page><page sequence="44">760291 - 760308 Public Power District; and J. L. Williams, General Public Utilities. Many failures, both major and minor, occur to utility derrick and aerial basket trucks and can be traced directly to the stresses imposed on the truck chassis frame. Some of these stresses will be reviewed by the user with the hope that it will provoke enough attention to the subject so that an adequate standard mounting procedure will be developed and accepted within the utility industry. On the other hand, the long range solution in some cases may be the design of a specific frame configuration to resist these stresses. 760291. Truck Chassis Frame Considerations in Equip- ment Mounting. G. C. Carver, A. O. Smith Corp. This paper discusses equipment installation practice as related to the truck chassis frame. General guidelines for bolting, clamping, and welded attachment are presented. Problems encountered by the installer, due to equipment mounting on standard chassis, are discussed so that the chassis designer may be aware of the situation. 1976 SA E Transactions 760293. Automation of the Final Assembly Operations on the Thick Film Ignition Module at Delco Elec- tronics. G. M. Wagner, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the thick film hybrid circuit system used in an under-the-hood application at Delco Elec- tronics. It also covers why the thick film concept was chosen for Delco's electronic ignition, and why almost total automation was chosen to manufacture the ignition. It demonstrates that the thick film hybrid circuit is an ideal system for automotive applications. 760294. One-Third of a Century of Army Interest in Automotive Hydraulic Brake Fluids. Charles B. Jordan, U.S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground. Since 1938 the US Army has assumed a leading role in the research and development of automotive hydraulic brake fluids. This effort is justified because military require- ments for brake fluids are more severe than usually encountered in normal civilian operation. Unique situa- tions to which military vehicles are exposed include cross-country travel, fording of streams, extreme climatic operating conditions, and unusual storage situations. Because of the need for fluids which will perform in these environments, Army brake fluid specifications are more stringent and specific than industrial specifications. 760295. Brake Tubing Corrosion - Its Causes, Effects, and Commercially Acceptable Elimination. Geof- frey Wildsmith and Robert Ward, Yorkshire Imperial Metals, Ltd. (United Kingdom). Seamless 90/10 copper-nickel brake tubing has been introduced in the European market for both original equipment and replacement applications on automobiles and trucks. It offers a significant advantage over other materials in terms of its combination of corrosion resistance, strength and formability at a price which is not prohibitive. 1976 SA E Transactions 760296. Race Car Brake Development for NASCAR. J. W. Douglas, Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler Brake Engineering was directed to produce brake systems to enable stock cars to be repeatedly braked from speeds of 150 mph every few minutes lap after lap. With better brakes a driver could drive deeper into the turns before backing off, picking up valuable split seconds. Initial investigation soon revealed that no one was doing an adequate job of providing good brakes. Drivers and car managers were doing the best they could but generally this consisted of looking over each others shoulders and copying the latest fad. This paper covers the development of the Delta drum brake and investigation into copper and cast iron disc brakes. 760297. The Real Potential of Containerization. Warren L. Serenbetz, Interpool Ltd. Living in an age of accelerating change, containerization was still being predicted five years ago, and today containers are the established mode. This paper presents the protential of containerization, stating that it will add to highway traffic, not diminish it. It also offers conser- vation, environmental, and capital benefits for utilizing containerization. 760307. An Experimental Study of Vehicle Refueling Emissions. Albert M. Hochhauser and Raymond J. Campion, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. When automobiles are refueled, hydrocarbon vapors are displaced from the vehicle tank and emitted to the atmosphere. An experimental program was carried out to measure both the mass and the volume of these emissions as a function of three variables: vehicle tank temperature, dispensed fuel temperature, and fuel volatility measured as Reid vapor pressure. Based on the experimental results, regression equa- tions were developed which can be used to accurately predict refueling emissions under a wide range of conditions. An analysis of the experimental results shows that the vapor balance system, the simpler, less expensive of the two systems being considered for control of refueling emissions, has the potential to meet strict standards under temperature conditions where ozone is likely to form in the atmosphere. 1976 SA E Transactions 760308. New-Tank Fueling Emissions. Jack B. King, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The purpose of measuring the new- tank fueling emission was to determine the extent of the assembly-line fueling emission. It was predicted that the hydrocarbon emission 57</page><page sequence="45">760309-760316 rate would be very small since a new tank contains only air. The test results showed, however, that when fueled in the normal manner the new-tank emission rate was greater than that of a used tank. Only by fueling in a splash-free manner was the new-tank emission rate less than that of a used or in-service tank. Splash-free fueling showed no advantage, however, when applied to a used tank except when the dispensed fuel quantity was small. The main cause for the new-tank emission rate exceeding that of the used tank was the degree and location of fuel splashing within the tank. A secondary cause was the larger volume of gas displaced from a new tank due to the establishment of a higher internal vapor pressure. 1976 SA E Transactions 760309. Procedures for Testing Vapor Recovery Systems at Service Stations. E. M. Liston, Stanford Research Institute. A test procedure has been developed, called the "Leak- Rate Procedure," which makes it possible to measure directly the weight of gasoline vapor lost from a vehicle tank during refueling. Experimental data show that this test procedure can be used to measure the losses from random vehicles with an accuracy of a few percent. The procedure can be used with displacement-type vapor recovery systems and may be useable with some secon- dary recovery systems. Data are presented to illustrate the problem with "baseline" test procedures. It was concluded that it is impractical to use the baseline procedure for determining vapor emissions when testing random vehi- cles at service stations where it is not possible to control or measure all of the variables all of the time. 1976 SA E Transactions 760310. Ceramic Substrate Technology for Automotive Catalysts. Maxwell Teague, Product Planning &amp; Development Staff, Chrysler Corp. Ceramic catalyst supports have played an important part in the successful application of catalyst technology to automotive emission control. They have been scientifically tailored to withstand the severe conditions present in engine exhaust. They provide the right kind of inert, durable surface to support the active catalyst. And, best of all: these ceramics are cheap, the raw materials are available, and they can be produced in automotive production volumes. 760311. Thermoplastics Process for Catalyst Substrates. C. Bent Lundsager and Gordon J. Turner, W. R. Grace &amp; Co.; and Joseph L. Pentecost, Georgia Institute of Technology. A process is described which is used to make ceramic substrates for auto exhaust catalyst. Suitable ceramic powders are mixed with a thermoplastic binder system which allows extrusion and shaping using conventional plastics processing equipment. 760312. CoO Sensors for Measurement and Control of Exhaust from Lean-Burn Engines. G. L. Beau- doin, K. R. Laud, E. M. Logothetis, A. H. Meitzler and K. Park, Engineering &amp; Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. An experimental exhaust sensor using CoO ceramic is being developed for measuring and controlling air-to-fuel ratio (A/F) of internal combustion engines operating under lean-burn conditions. The operation of the sensor is based on the fact that at elevated temperatures the electrical resistance of CoO depends on the oxygen partial pressure (P02)- At controlled temperatures, the combi- nation of good ^02 sensitivity, high reproducibility of the electrical properties and small temperature coefficient of resistance of CoO materials make this sensor suitable for the lean A/F range (15-20) where exhaust Po2 depends only weakly on A/F ratio. At low P02 (A/F&lt;13.5) and high temperatures, CoO reduces to Co; therefore, pro- longed exposure of the sensor to these conditions must be avoided. The material properties and the sensor char- acteristics are discussed and results of tests on car- mountable CoO sensors are presented. Durability and large-scale manufacturability of these sensors have not yet been established. 760313. Sensing Shaft Position Without Contact. Ru- dolph Hohenberg, Measurement Science Dept., Mechanical Technology Inc. This paper compiles useful measurement methods appli- cable to noncontact shaft position determination. Mech- anisms to perform these measurements are grouped; characteristics, advantages and limitations are described. Specific applications of practical noncontact probes are reported. 760314. 100,000 HP Gas Turbine Load Test Facility. Roy P. Allen and Thomas F. Smith, Gas Turbine Div., General Electric Co. The problem of testing large gas turbines at full load in the factory has been solved with the construction of a load test facility utilizing a gas turbine compressor as the load absorption device. Design philosophy and features are reviewed, and a summary of operating experience to date is presented. 760315. Load Simulation Testing with Electro-Pneumatic Servo Systems. Ernie Sambrano, Ford Motor Co.; and Richard E. Sipfle, Pegasus Div., Koehring Co. The recent introduction of closed loop electro-pneumatic servo systems for load simulation fills a gap between the performance limitations of open loop systems, and the higher cost of closed loop hydraulic systems. Closed loop pneumatic systems have been successfully employed in a number of load simulation applications. 760316. Optimizing-Whaťs That? Lance Finberg and Rod Larson, MTS Systems Corp. 58</page><page sequence="46">760317-760321 The purpose of this paper is to present the past and present concepts of mechanical test optimization, which means the adjustment of a test machine command signal to achieve desired amplitude and mean levels. In partic- ular, the methods of null pacing, dynamic frequency control, classical amplitude control, and maximum veloc- ity limiting/control are discussed along with their respec- tive application areas, advantages and disadvantages. Also, the factors of data verification and over-compli- cation of the test are noted. 760317. A Neuber's Rule Fatigue Analysis Procedure for Use with a Mobile Computer. Stephen Downing, Dale Galliart and Tibor Berenyi, Deere &amp; Co. A mobile data acquisition and reduction system utilizing a minicomputer is discussed. In detail, a crack initiation fatigue computer program is presented with explanations of the systems structure, theoretical considerations, numerical analysis techniques and data handling pro- cedures. The results are compared with data from the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee's Cumulative Fatigue Damage Test Program. 1976 SAE Transactions 760318. Copper-Chromium-Nickel Alloys for NOx Re- duction Automotive Emission Control Catalysts. P. D. Goodell and R. H. Kane, The Interna- tional Nickel Company, Inc., Paul D. Merica Research Laboratory; and G. W. Tuffnell, The International Nickel Company, Inc. The development of two base metal NOx reduction catalysts, IN- 101 3 and IN- 1050 is described. The catalysts are based on unique alloys of copper, chromium and nickel which form protective and catalytically active surface scales. The alloys are prepared as prealloyed powders and can be formed into a variety of low mass, high surface, open structures by deposition on suitable metal preforms. Laboratory and engine dynamometer tests indicate catalytic capability for high net NOx conversions at 1100°F and above. "Three-way" operation may also be possible. The air/fuel ratio "window" for either mode of operation is shown to be significantly greater for fluc- tuating exhaust compositions than for steady state conditions. Limited durability tests indicate capability to perform as a NOx reduction catalyst for extended mileage, but HC conversion fades with catalyst aging. One example of a current vehicle emission control system using IN-1013 is described. 760319. Lean Thermal Reactor Performance Character- istics - A Screening Study. Ronald J. Herrin, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The automotive thermal reactor may be suitable for controlling the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from lean-mixture engines. Little is known about the performance characteristics of "lean" reactors, however, since much of the previous research on reactors considered only rich-engine operation. This study screened the effects of six operating variables on lean- reactor performance by means of a fractional factorial experiment. Also, spatial temperature and species con- centration distributions within the experimental two-pass reactor were obtained at several operating conditions. Of the variables screened, reactor insulation had the largest effect on emissions performance. Higher engine speed, retarded spark timing, and a less lean air-fuel ratio were also shown to improve reactor performance signif- icantly. Within the range of this study, exhaust flow rate and engine exhaust-port liners did not significantly affect reactor performance. High HC conversion efficiencies were obtained at many combinations of the six variables. CO conversion efficiencies were generally lower, and at several conditions CO was produced within the reactor from the partial oxidation of HC. Internal sampling revealed that most of the HC oxidation occurred in the reactor core, which was both larger and hotter than the surrounding annulus. 1976 SAE Transactions 760320. A Guard System to Limit Catalytic Converter Temperature. James R. Mondt, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. High- temperature sintering can cause loss of activity in the catalyst of an automotive emission control system. The elevated temperature required to sinter the catalyst could arise from a combination of a warmed-up converter plus unusually high engine-out carbon monoxide or unburned hydrocarbon "fuel". This unburned "fuel" could result from sustained engine misfiring due to faulty ignition or from a prolonged high-speed, closed-throttle coast. Such abnormal "fuel" input to the converter has been prevented in all 1975 General Motors production vehicles by using the more reliable High Energy Ignition system and by properly controlling engine operating parameters during a closed-throttle coast. During the Corporate-wide program to develop sys- tems to limit catalytic converter temperature, a "guard" converter system was evaluated as one of many candidate solutions. The guard system uses a small monolith catalyst to oxidize a controlled fraction of the unburned "fuel" in the engine exhaust stream, then rejects heat from this partially treated exhaust before passing the gas on to the main bead-bed converter located downstream. In tests with a bead bed and a guard system installed on a 1974 pre-con verter vehicle, maximum bead-bed temperature during closed-throttle coasts was lowered significantly, with no penalty in emissions on the 1975 Federal Test Procedure. However, the reliability of the guard system is limited by deterioration of the very small monoliths. This deterioration must be improved sub- stantially before the guard system is a viable production candidate. 760321. Rejuvenation of Lead-Poisoned Noble Metal Catalysts. Walter G. Rothschild, Ford Motor 59</page><page sequence="47">760323 - 760328 Co. The acetic acid-ammonium acetate methods of catalyst rejuvenation by lead removal have been of considerable interest. The effectiveness of these methods was therefore investigated in the laboratory as a function of temper- ature, duration of treatment, type of agitation, and cation, using mainly catalyst samples poisoned by treatment with a lead acetate solution, with confirmation by vehicle-aged catalyst samples. The results have, in general, been encouraging. For instance, washing of poisoned catalyst samples with 10 wt % acetic acid solution at room temperature for half an hour was sufficient to improve the hydrocarbon conversion of a catalyst poisoned with 5 wt % Pb (typical of a catalyst aged for about 50,000 miles with fuel containing 0.03 g Pb/gl) by 15%. However, we found that such a rejuvenated catalyst, if subjected to a laboratory repoisoning test with 0.03 g Pb/gl fuel, loses hydrocarbon activity rapidly. The rate of activity loss upon repoisoning appears to be about 6 times faster than the average loss rate experienced before the rejuvenation treatment. On the other hand, a poisoned catalyst sample which was rejuvenated by a more drastic treatment (e.g. two treatments for 3 hrs each, at 195° F with ultrasonic agitation), appeared to have the same rate of activity loss upon further aging as a fresh catalyst after the initial aging. This study also showed that there is no significant difference in rejuvenation effectiveness among acetic acid or ammonium acetate at the same concentration. 760323. The 1975 International Conference on Personal Rapid Transit. J. Edward Anderson, Conference General Chairman Consultant, Raytheon Com- pany. The 1975 International Conference on Personal Rapid Transit, held in Denver, Colorado, on September 16-19, brought together engineers, planners, architects, econo- mists, politicians, transit-minded citizens, and students from six countries. Since PRT is in the formative stage, opinions differ greatly as to how and whether these systems should be built. Through presentation and discussion of 47 papers and several panels, the conference did much to clarify the characteristics of PRT. Partic- ularly on the basis of economics, urban design, system operations, and public need, a strong case was made that PRT development should receive strong support. 760325. Metallurgical Examination of Scored and Ridged Hypoid Gears. E. W. Friess, Rockwell Inter- national. A metallurgical study has been made of the failure mechanisms of scored and ridged hypoid gears using light and electron microscopes. The existence of two scoring mechanisms, the adhesion theory and a delamination theory are firmly elucidated. An interesting phenomenon often termed "White Etching Zones," concomitant with scoring, has been investigated. This white layer may be postulated to be evidenced of catastrophic thermoplastic shear. 760326. Development of a Rear Axle Lubricant. W. F. Olszewski and D. D. Neiswender, Mobil R&amp;D Corp. Research studies on a wide variety of industrial and laboratory organic chemical compounds have led to the development of a new high-quality, sulfur-phosphorus rear axle lubricant. Through extensive use of bench-type screening tests, new technology was developed to provide a formulation with exceptional anti-rust performance as measured by the CRC L-33 Test. Other outstanding features include EP protection, long-term copper corro- sion protection capabilities, foam control, and thermal oxidation stability. The additive components may be used in mineral oils or synthetic fluids where extreme weather operation is desired. The formulation may also be used with extremely shear-stable viscosity index improvers to formulate multigrade rear axle lubricants. 760327. Test Techniques for the Evaluation of Lubricant Effects on Axle Break-in Temperature - Inves- tigation with an Integrally Built Rear Axle of a European Sedan. Z. M. Holubec and W. C. Brandów, The Lubrizol Corporation. It has been recognized for many years that multipurpose axle lubricants give rise to much higher axle break-in temperatures than lead-soap, active-sulfur or sulfur- chlorine-lead lubricants. Evaluation of differences in axle lubricant break-in temperature between the various multipurpose gear lubricants has been complicated by lack of repeatability and reproducibility. The work described in this paper shows that one of the most important variables affecting axle break-in temper- ature, under the conditions of the test technique used, was torsional axle preload and that control of dimensional preload in itself is not sufficient to ensure good test repeatability. The test technique described here has been used to evaluate the axle lubricant break-in temperature prop- erties of several sulfur-phosphorus multipurpose gear lubricants. The technique has been shown to be highly repeatable and reproducible when temperatures are compared at normalized variables of ambient temperature and torsional axle preload. This paper is primarily limited to a study of the axle break-in temperature behavior of a Volvo sedan equipped with an integrally built rear axle, driven at or below the maximum weight limitation imposed by the manufacturer. 760328. Test Techniques for the Evaluation of Lubricant Effects on Axle Break-In Temperature - Inves- tigation of Test Techniques with a Domestic (USA) Sedan. B. M. O'Connor and W. C. Brandów, The Lubrizol Corporation. High lubricant temperatures generated during the break- in of new differential assemblies has been of concern among original equipment manufacturers (OEM's). Many tests have been devised to measure the effects of speed, load and lubricant on the temperature generated in the 60</page><page sequence="48">760329 - 760336 axle. The major problem confronting the use of these tests has been a lack of repeatability and/or reproducibility. Recently, a European OEM axle lubricant break-in test procedure using a European sedan test vehicle has demonstrated highly repeatable and reproducible results. Test work had been limited to the European sedan. The applicability of the European OEM test procedure to a larger domestic U.S. vehicle was questioned. This paper discusses the applicability of the European test to a domestic sedan. Additionally, two other axle break-in test procedures were conducted using the same domestic sedan test vehicle. Three sulfur-phosphorus multi-purpose gear lubricants were evaluated. Comparison of lubricant response was made between test vehicles, test procedures and test facilities. 760329. Effect of Rear Axle Lubricants on the Fatigue Life of Tapered Roller Bearings. Richard K. Kepple and Melvin F. Johnson, New Departure Hyatt Bearings Div., General Motors Corp. The effect of rear axle lubricants on the fatigue life of tapered roller bearings was determined employing a laboratory test fixture. The tests were conducted under a controlled thrust load, inner race speed, and jet oil inlet temperature. The fatigue lives obtained with the rear axle lubricants were compared to the fatigue life obtained with a premium hydraulic oil. The comparison showed that rear axle lubricants can reduce the fatigue life of tapered roller bearings from 17% to 67% of rated. 760331. Instant Set Polymer - A New Dimension in Plastics. E. L. Kropscott, E. E. Jones and P. H. Cook, Dow Chemical Co. A new plastic and processing technology known as ISP (Instant Set Polymer) has been developed that allows production of essentially any size part via liquid injection molding. Mold cycle (60 sec) is independent of part area or thickness (1/4" to 6"). Items 12 inches thick and weighing 200 lbs have been successfully produced. 760332. A Thermoplastic RIM System for Automotive Fascia. P. S. Carleton, J. H. Ewen, Jr., T. M. Shah, H. E. Reymore, Jr. and A. A. R. Sayigh, The Upjohn Co. A thermoplastic polyurethane has been developed which can be processed by reaction injection molding and which can be recycled as necessary by injection molding. An MDI-based quasi-prepolymer was developed specifically for this material. The properties meet specifications for automotive fascia, including painted bumperette impact and paint adhesion. The effect of postcure is to improve both high and low temperature properties. It is recom- mended that part weight reduction be achieved by using thinner wall thicknesses. 760333. Glass Fiber Reinforced Elastomers for Automo- tive Applications - A Comparison of RIM Ure- thanes and Alternative Material Systems. Allan B. Isham, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. Glass fibers added to RIM urethanes provide materials which offer the automotive engineer a broadened per- formance spectrum. The composite materials are stiffer and have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than unreinforced urethanes. These attributes have been beneficial to the growth of the use of plastic materials over the past thirty years. High pressure RIM process equipment for the newer material systems can be designed to handle glass fibers. Each process equipment system must be analyzed in terms of the effect of glass fibers on the system's components. Performance comparisons with other automotive elastomers, such as injection molded thermoplastic ure- thanes and EPDM compounds, show that glass fibers provide similar benefits to all of the competitive material systems. Comparative data describe how tailoring of the elastomers is possible and desirable in order to meet current automotive fascia guidelines. 760334. Rigid RIM - A Microcellular Structural Foam. Richard J. Ferrari, Davidson Rubber Co., Inc. RIM technology has been used to develop a breakthrough for flexible plastics in the automotive industry. The parts made by this process are thin-sectioned fascia panels used as front or rear ends, replacing metal components. Because of the versatility of this chemistry and tech- nology, formulations have now been expanded to incor- porate high rigidity. These can be used to manufacture rigid structures which are stylish, have an excellent finish, and feature low weight and non-damageability. 760335. Finishing of Flexible Automotive Exterior Parts. C. M. VanPaemel, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. This paper discusses the finishing aspects involved in coating flexible substrate materials. Emphasis is placed on the physical characteristics of current flexible enamel topcoats designed for OEM usage. In addition, the paint processing steps involved in finishing thermoset urethanes molded by the RIM technique are outlined. Topcoat application and specifications for appear- ance, physical properties and durability are discussed in detail. Substrate-topcoat interaction is discussed in terms of the effect on initial physical properties and durability of the finished part. The durability of a coated flexible system is compared to the durability of conventionally coated rigid materials. 760336. Automation of the RIM Process. W. A. Ludwico and M. E. Cekoric, Mobay Chemical Corp. The most recent material and processing improvements crucial for fully automatic production of the Monza 2 + 2 front fascia by the Reaction Injection Molding (RIM) process were discussed. The fully automatic capability of RIM process was demonstrated and filmed at Mobay. A two minute automatic cycle competitive with existing injection molding processes was shown to be feasible. 61</page><page sequence="49">760337 - 760343 Finally, the advantages of RIM systems over both metal and thermoplastic materials for exterior automotive body parts were reviewed, with emphasis on the impressive overall energy savings of the RIM process, relative to its competitors. 760337. Multihead Plants in Polyurethane RIM Tech- nology. Carlo Fiorentini, CANNON/AFROS (Italy). This paper deals with the principles which will have to be taken into consideration when evaluating and designing multi-head plants for the polyurethane reaction injection moulding technique, the so-called RIM process. 760338. Improved Efficiency of Transmission Case Ma- chining- A GPSS-V Simulation of a Transfer Line. L. E. Hanifin and S. G. Liberty, Chrysler Corp. General Manufacturing Div. The fact that transfer lines constitute the most prevalent means of part production, coupled with the huge price tag they carry, makes it necessary for the management of production facilities to thoroughly assess changes in design and management of transfer lines before imple- mentation. Answers to this assessment require a more sophisticated, powerful tool than that of the traditional, "one-machine" analysis. It is the purpose of this paper to describe this more powerful tool and its application to a specific transfer line which machines transmission cases. 1976 SA E Transactions 760339. The Astro Spiral Jump - An Automobile Stunt Designed via Computer Simulation. Raymond R. McHenry, Calspan Corp. An unusual application of a computer simulation of automobile dynamics to the design of a thrill show stunt is described. The rationale for development of the simu- lation for highway safety applications is discussed and the general analytical approach is described. Computer graphics displays of simulation outputs, consisting of detailed perspective drawings of the vehicle and terrain features or obstacles at selected intervals of time during a simulated maneuver, are presented. For the presentation of the paper, computer graphics displays of simulation outputs will be animated through the use of motion picture film. Also, motion picture coverage of both developmental tests and public performances of the Astro Spiral Jump will be shown. 1976 SA E Transactions 760340. Recent Advances in Vehicular Steam Engine Efficiency. Rodney L. Burton, Steam Power Systems, Inc. Previous SPS vehicular steam expander development is reviewed. A counterflow expander installed in the 3000 lb (1364 kg) California Steam Car is shown to give 6.2 mpg (2.2 km/1) over the Urban Federal Driving Cycle, for BSFC = 1.2. Advantages of the uniflow expander with impulse valves are discussed, and the equation for theoretical cycle efficiency is derived. Laboratory tests on a 4 cylinder uniflow with impulse valves and a 2000 psia (136 atm), 1400° F (760°C) monotube boiler are described, and efficiency results for steam temperatures up to 1100°F (593°C) are presented. The measured brake thermal efficiency of the test uniflow increases with expansion ratio E from .146 to .225 for 5.7&lt;E&lt;14.0. The counterflow efficiency decreases with E, from .18 to .11 for 7&lt;E&lt;15. Internal losses are discussed, and the higher efficiency of the uniflow is justified on the basis of lower internal leakage, heat transfer and friction. 760341. The Carter System-Preliminary Test Results of Second Generation Steam Engine. Jay W. Carter, Jr., Jay Carter Enterprises, Inc.; and William J. Wingenbach, AMF Advanced Sys- tems Laboratory. A second generation Carter Steam Engine has been built by Jay Carter Enterprises, Inc. It is now undergoing bench testing prior to installation in a Paratransit Vehicle being produced for the Urban Mass Transportation Adminis- tration by AMF Incorporated. Results to date confirm that the goal of very low emissions is being attained. Engine test data has been used in conjunction with a computer simulation of the steam engine in the Para- transit Vehicle. Projected fuel consumption over the Federal City Driving Cycle is 17.5 mpg and over the combined city /highway cycle is 18.9 mpg. The 100 hp engine is capable of vehicle acceleration from 0-45 mph in 11 seconds. All test results indicate that the engine is a viable candidate as an alternate automobile power plant. 760342. The Application of the Positive Displacement Reciprocating Steam Expander to the Passenger Car. Roger L. Dernier, Scientific Energy Systems Corp. The current generation of automotive steam engines has demonstrated very low exhaust emissions. For the steam automotive engine to become a viable alternative, future development must now focus on improved economy, lower weight and lower cost. Improved thermodynamic cycles have the potential for superior fuel economy with lower weight and reduced cost components. The positive displacement reciprocating expander performance char- acteristics are modelled as a function of geometric decisions, operating pressure ratio, breathing loss, friction, and heat loss. The expander model provides a means of estimating net engine performance trade-offs as a function of the thermodynamic cycle and expander design choices. The performance potentials of an improved current cycle steam engine and an advanced reheat cycle steam engine are compared to other engine types on a cruise fuel economy basis. 760343. Compounding the Truck Diesel Engine with an Organic Rankine-Cycle System. Parimal S. Patel and Edward F. Doyle, R&amp;D Center, Thermo Electron Corp. 62</page><page sequence="50">760344 - 760350 An organic Rankine-cycle system (ORCS) operating on the heat from the exhaust gases of a truck diesel engine is described. The addition of an ORCS to a long haul diesel truck can improve the fuel economy by 15% over a typical duty cycle. This represents a potential reduction of 1.8 billion gal/yr (120,000 barrels/day) in near- term trans- portation fuel requirements. Emission levels will also be reduced by an amount equal to the gain in efficiency. At current diesel fuel cost, the potential fuel savings also provide an economic incentive to the fleet operator to invest in the added cost of a bottoming cycle system. Results from tests conducted with a Mack 676 diesel engine and an organic Rankine bottoming cycle (not specifically designed for this application) are presented. At the peak power condition, 36 additional horsepower was produced, a gain of 13% in power without additional fuel. 760344. Progress of Saab Scania's Steam Power Project. Ove B. Piateli, Saab Scania AB (Sweden). For many years we at Saab Scania have comprehensively studied the characteristics of different solutions for a steam automotive system. Since 1968 we have entirely devoted our time to a system using water as a working medium. We also use a piston engine without gearbox or clutch. The R&amp;D work has been concentrated on the critical components. Problems of common engineering character, such as cranking mechanism etc., have been dealt with in a very limited way. Progress of the development work can be reported when it comes to compactness. An almost complete method has been developed for the cooling system. To some degree improvements have been made regarding the steam generation system and the expander. Recently it has been possible to make a fairly good estimate of production costs. These indicate almost equal costs compared with the conventional power system. 760345. The Effects of Braking on the Directional Con- trollability of Automobiles. Roy S. Rice, Calapan Corp.; and Stephen Sacks, Natl. Highway Traf- fic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation. This paper describes an approach to the development of a test procedure for measuring the combined steering and braking performance of automobiles with possible appli- cation to the formulation of a safety standard. The study was performed under Contract No. DOT-HS-4-00971 for the NHTSA. The influences and interactions of the many factors which must be considered in developing a meaningful and objective procedure are discussed. These include such diverse items as definition of test conditions and equipment requirements, identification of the signif- icant operational variables (initial speed, permissible control functions, performance metrics, etc.), means for discriminating between vehicle and driver effects, and determination of acceptable performance levels. A full- scale test program, aimed at obtaining actual performance information on the effect of various factors, is described. Emphasis is placed on identifying operational situations having distinct for accident potential (i.e., conditions in which excessive brake pedal force might be applied as in a panic stop) and on the role of the driver in attempting to minimize loss-of-control possibilities at this condition. Test results showing the marked differences in directional behavior which can occur as functions of magnitude of applied brake pedal force (and, consequently, of wheel lock-up patterns) are presented in the form of graphs and tables. Comparisons between driver-controlled and ma- chine-controlled operations have been made in order to devise a low-cost unambiguous procedure that properly reflects accident potential. 760347. Analysis, Design and Testing of Two-Way Pro- portioning for Improved Braking in a Turn. Rudolf Limpert and Kyle Robbins, University of Utah; and Arnold J. Gilchrist, Ultrasystems, Inc. The object of this paper is to investigate the effects of two-way brake proportioning for improved braking in a turn. The theory of two-way proportioning is discussed. A typical design study is presented and verified by exper- imental data for a passenger car. The principles discussed apply to passenger cars, trucks, and combination vehicles. 1976 SA E Transactions 760348. Development and Evaluation of Anti-Lock Brake Systems. Maurice H. Cardon, George B. Hickner and Ralph W. Rothfusz, Bendix Corp. Anti-lock systems which effectively prevent wheel lock have been developed for passenger cars, trucks, articu- lated vehicles and buses. Six anti-lock system configu- rations involving individual wheel and axle control are discussed. Also discussed are techniques for evaluating the performance anti-systems; included are straight line braking, the use of a split coefficient surface and braking in a turn. The results of computer simulation studies and vehicle tests conducted to evaluate the performance of the various anti-lock system configurations are presented. It is concluded that the best anti-lock system configuration for a particular vehicle requires a trade off among vehicle design characteristics, desired level of braking, and vehicle handling performance and cost. 760350. Passenger-Car Cornering and Braking Tests on Wet Pavements. Gordon G. Hayes, Transpor- tation Inst., Texas A &amp; M University. Limit maneuvers were performed on wet pavements with disparate passenger vehicles, and the vehicle-available accelerations were compared with pavement friction indicators. The dependency of these available acceler- ations on vehicle, tire and pavement characteristics, and also on the type of maneuver and environmental factors, precludes accurate predictions based on simple measures of pavement friction. Low rear tire tread depths and inflation pressures produced the more pronounced de- crease in cornering capability, and 0.10-0.15 inch water 63</page><page sequence="51">760351 -760358 depths resulted in hydroplaning at normal highway speeds. 760351. Test Procedures for Studying Vehicle Dynamics in Lane-Change Maneuvers. Paul Fancher, Leonard Segel, James Bernard and Robert Ervin, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univer- sity of Michigan. The use of both closed- and open-loop test procedures for evaluating the performance of motor vehicles in lane- change maneuvers is reviewed. It is found that (a) variations in driver skill, (b) differences in the amount of information imparted to the driver by the layout of the test course, (c) the asymmetry in response between right and left lane-changes, and (d) the lack of understanding of the connection between open- and closed-loop perform- ance present difficulties in evaluating lane-change per- formance. Further study is recommended using a partic- ular form of evasive performance test to seek identifiable ergonomie and vehicle dynamics bounds on driver- vehicle system performance. 760352. Silicone Rubber Oil Seals for Diesel Engines. G. Christie and T. J. Gair, General Electric Co.; and R. D. Hercamp, Cummins Engine Co. Standard laboratory immersion tests show silicone rubber to be stable in ASTM #1, #3 oils and in unused engine lube oils. However, new test data have shown that silicone rubber will degrade when exposed to engine lube oil which has functioned in lubricating a diesel engine for many hours of service. Special silicone rubber compounds have greatly improved the resistance to degradation as shown by laboratory tests and diesel engine tests of cylinder liner seals. These silicone rubber materials should also better the seal performance in other engine applications requir- ing low temperature flex, high temperature and petroleum base oil resistance. 760353. Automation in the Manufacture of Oil Seals. Luigi Bertrandi, Italian Automotive Operations (Italy). The sharp rise of labour costs combined with reduced Company earnings, credit squeeze and high interest rates made it necessary to introduce an automation programme that, for the same quality product, gives a significant cost reduction with reasonable investments. Two main operations in seal production which require the major part of the manual labour and increase costs are: 1. Curing 2. Control This paper describes a new kind of automatic system with which these operations can be accomplished. A special equipment called "Speedy Mould" was built for the curing operations. The essential part of this is a 14 station rotary injection machine. The equipment is suitable for handling nitrile, acrylic, viton, silicone and flourinated rubbers. The control operations of the seals is made by an electromechanical equipment that checks automatically the ID and OD, the eccentricity, the lip pressure and the presence of the springs. The dimensions are controlled by an electrical instrument, the lip pressure by a spring loaded split mandrel and the presence of the springs by a magnetic sensor. 760355. Molding the Modern Oil Seal. Robert V. Brink, Pentaject Co. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the molding of modern oil seals, a difficult and challenging process. The procedure for rubber molding is outlined, and the difference between compression molding and injection molding is explained. 760357. The Potential For Transit Standards. T. B. Deen, Alan M. Voorhees &amp; Associates, Inc. There is little doubt that there is a desire for transit standards to assist in decision making across the entire range of planning, designing, constructing and operating the transit system. Even discussing this broad range is difficult, since both the breadth and depth of potential application areas for standards is of such scale as to be outside the expertise of any single individual. A general classification scheme is developed for structuring the discussion which distinguishes between standards for different transit modes, as well as between fixed facilities and vehicles. Transit standards are divided into input standards - relating to those system attributes under the control of the planner, designer, or operator - and output standards - which reflect the ultimate objectives which the system is designed to satisfy. Examination of standards related to rail transit reveal some standardization accepted in practice, though it is not clear whether this acceptance is because of demonstrated benefits or simply conventional practice. Some areas can be identified where standard- ization might result in cost savings. 1976 SA E Transactions 760358. Balancing External Standardization With Inter- nal Policy Making In Urban Mass Transporta- tion. E. S. Cheaney, Battelle, Columbus Labo- ratories Transportation Systems Section. This paper examines three policies for standardization within the urban mass transportation industry and investigates the feasibility of using benefit-cost analysis to establish which of these would be most effective. Stan- dardization is viewed as being aimed at improving passenger welfare (safety, security, health, and comfort), service levels, and economic performance. Policies con- sidered are (1) voluntary standardization by individual properties, (2) voluntary standardization within a frame- work of guidelines, goals, and leadership provided by an outside authority, and (3) universal standards imposed on all properties by an outside authority. A benefit-cost approach is tentatively found feasible, and a qualitative analysis of passenger welfare standardization is described. 64</page><page sequence="52">760359 - 760366 760359. Standardization Requirements for the Implemen- tation of AGT Systems. Ray MacDonald, De Leuw, Cather &amp; Company. The development of Automated Guideway Transit Sys- tems has already followed the classical patterns exhibited by other transit technologies in the early stages of their development. It is important for AGT systems, and in particular for PRT that this evolutionary process should be condensed into as short a time frame as possible consistent with a full investigation of all practical options in technology. The object of this paper is to discuss those elements of AGT systems which are susceptible to standardization and to propose a course of action which would rationalize the wide range of hardware and software presently under development. The nature of this paper is necessarily philosophical; however, it is intended to produce a catalytic effect which will stimulate thought rather than present an analytical solution. 760360. Objective Ride Quality Measurement. William H. Park and James C. Wambold, Pennsylvania State University. This paper describes the use of a measurement and data reduction system for objective ride quality assessment which can be used in all types of transportation systems. The basis of the data handling is the use of the absorbed power criteria developed by Pradko and Lee, modified by using the Amplitude Frequency Distribution (AFD) method, and incorporating a human simulator to obtain the objective parameters used in the ride calculations. The AFD method was originally developed by the authors as a better description of road roughness than commonly used random data descriptions. The method is a joint proba- bility density of amplitude and frequency and therefore maintains both spectrum data and amplitude distribution. The human simulator was developed to eliminate the need for extensive subjective testing. The study showed that in the frequency range of interest to ride quality work, a two-degree-of-freedom simulator adequately modeled human response. The device was built to simulate the response of a 170-lb man and the necessary instrumen- tation was installed. The complete system was placed in a motor home and comparison data was obtained from both the simulator and a similar human over a wide range of roads varying from very smooth to very rough. The acceleration from both the human subject and the simulator were recorded simultaneously. The analog signals from this test show excellent ągreement and samples are presented. The analog data was reduced to absorbed power levels using AFD format and these values obtained from both the subject and simulator show good agreement. The absorbed power information is tabulated. In conclusion, the data reduction method used with the human simulator can be employed for ride quality evaluation of any transportation system be it ground, air, or water. In addition, it can be used in prototype development, redesign, maintenance, vehicle manufac- turing, or by guideway designers. 1976 SA E Transactions 760361. A Road Simulation System for Heavy Duty Vehicles. B. W. Cryer and P. E. Nawrocki, Truck and Coach Div., General Motors Corp.; and R. A. Lund, MTS Systems Corp. A road simulator system has been developed for heavy duty vehicles. The system utilizes vertical inputs to the tires and corrects for heavy duty vehicle simulation problems such as solid axle cross-coupling, different tire contact patches for front and rear tires, tire nonlinearity, and variation in vehicle speed. The system operates in two modes which allow reproduction of response measured on a particular road, or simulation of vehicle response to a class of roads described by a PSD Matrix. The road profile generation techniques for each mode of operation are described. These techniques determine effective road inputs from measured vehicle response through a multiple input-multiple output systems analysis of the vehicle. Laboratory test results for both modes of simulator operation are presented. 1 976 SA E Transactions 760362. Load and Stress Investigation of a New Concept Wheel Bearing Hub. E. D. Dominik, Timken Co. Finite Element modeling and analysis techniques can effectively support design and testing of complex me- chanical components. This paper discusses how Finite Element modeling was utilized in the design and evalu- ation of a cup carrier for a new concept wheel bearing. Also discussed are field and laboratory tests conducted to check the validity of the Finite Element approach. 1976 SA E Transactions 760363. Vehicle Underbody Temperature and Heat Re- jection Correlation - Wind Tunnel Versus Track. Alexander R. Peters, University of Nebraska at Lincoln; and Wendel B. Crum, Ford Motor Co. Vehicle temperatures depend on an interrelationship between the rate of engine heat rejection and vehicle speed. An experimental study was undertaken to compare power train component and underbody temperatures of a vehicle run on an outdoor proving ground with those of a vehicle run in a wind tunnel. The experiment was designed to isolate the effects of load and vehicle velocity. Based upon this study, wind tunnel and track results were found' to be in close correlation when driveshaft horsepower was used as the correlation parameter. The under-vehicle airflow, as it relates to underbody temperatures and heat transfer, appears to be similar. 760366. Degradation Effects on Motor Vehicle Exhaust Emission. J. A. Gunderson, Olson Labs., Inc.; and L. Resnick, California Air Resources Board. A total of 600 (1968-1974) randomly selected vehicles were screened by engine parameter, safety, and idle tests. 65</page><page sequence="53">760368 - 760374 Those cars requiring major engine repairs or safety defects were rejected. Five hundred and seventy-six (576) were selected for testing and incorporated into four test groups. Each group contains 144 vehicles and are designated as the Baseline Control Group (Group I), the Inspection Group (Group II), a Manufacturer's Specification Group (Group III), and a Mandatory Maintenance and Param- eter Inspection Group (Group IV). All vehicles entering the test program received a baseline 1972 Federal CVS emission test, followed by a hot-idle test (low and 2,500 rpm). Adjustment or repair of vehicles was accomplished by Olson Laboratories for Group II and Group III vehicles. Class A garages performed maintenance on Group IV vehicles. Following the necessary maintenance, the Federal and idle tests were repeated for Group II, Group III, and Group IV vehicles. All vehicles in these groups were retested at 1-3- 6- 9- and 12-month intervals. 760368. Chicago's Experience in Vehicle Emission Testing. H. W. Poston and Joseph Seliber, Dept. of Environmental Control. This paper provides a description of automated test procedures and equipment used by the City of Chicago. Two idle testing modes are used. Emission averages for CO and HC are given for different model year range vehicles and different makes of vehicles based on tests of approximately 190,000 vehicles in 1974. The "cause of failure," (high CO only, high HC only, or both,) is statistically analyzed and emission averages are given. A method of calculating air quality improvement from idle emission averages and other data is illustrated. The effects of seasonal variations is shown to be minimal. Results are given for a 12 month testing period in which approxi- mately 25% of low mileage 1975 model year vehicles failed the City test. The importance of emission surveillance as a tool in improving air quality is indicated by the relatively high emission averages of "failed" vehicles in the 1970-74 model year range. 760369. (SP-402) Heavy-Duty Truck Suspensions. E. R. Sternberg, White Motor Corp. Truck suspensions for heavy-duty trucks perform complex and conflicting functions and have been the subject of much development. This paper provides information on many types of suspensions presently in use and indicates those applications for which the particular types of suspensions in use are best suited. While primary emphasis is placed on leaf spring suspensions, data are also provided on other types of suspension such as rubber, air, torsion bar, and solid mount suspensions which are in current use. 1976 SA E Transactions 760370. Lower Torso Injuries and Automobile Seat Belts. D. F. Huelke, University of Michigan Medical School; and T. E. Lawson, Highway Safety Research Inst., University of Michigan. Injuries to the lower torso (abdomen, pelvis, and lumbar spine) were studied in front seat, lap-belted, outboard occupants involved in frontal crashes. The data indicate that the "no injury" category is increased by 50% in belt users over unbelted occupants. Of injured lap-belted occupants, only one in five was injured in the lower torso area. Of these injuries, 7 out of 10 were rated as minor. Belts reduce the occurrence of serious injuries in all lower torso regions except the lumbar area. The more serious injuries occur at impact speeds of over 30 mph. Only 5% of the injured lap-belted occupants had critical to life-threatening injuries in the lower torso area. The angle of the seat belt does not appear to be related to lower torso injury severity. 760371. Friction and Wear Characteristics of Silicone- Modified Thermoplastics. Richard F. Smith, Dow Corning Corp. Self-lubricating plastic bearing materials can be produced by adding a small quantity of silicone fluid directly to the thermoplastic melt. The result is a substantial increase in the critical load-speed (limiting pressure-velocity or LPV) limit of the plastic, above which rapid wear takes place. The magnitude of the improvement in lubricity suggests the possibility of replacing metals with plastics, or replacing expensive plastics with silicone-modified, in- expensive plastics. LPV of some plastics has been raised as much as 1000 percent by the silicone additive, where LPV was measured at high speeds. At low speeds, less improvement is noted, but results are still significant. Data on the effect of the additive on various thermoplastics will be presented, along with a discussion of the correlation between wear rate and LPV. The additive also improves the handling properties of plastics, producing better flow, easier release from low-draft molds, and other advantages. 760373. Wheel Bearing Mountings for Highway Vehicles. Henry J. Wasik, Timken Co. Wheel bearings for cars and trucks continue to receive the interest and study of vehicle designers and builders. Bearings must maintain their historic reliability in the face of changing design requirements and environmental conditions. Designers are under pressure to reduce unsprung weights and component costs. The basic considerations for wheel bearing performance are reviewed and new approaches for design, calculation and standardization are introduced. The fatigue life of the bearings is the first consid- eration. Bearing setting, lubrication, and mounting prac- tices are other key factors in a successful wheel bearing mounting. 1976 SA E Transactions 760374. Dynamic Characteristics of Parallel Linkage Pendulums. William J. J. Liu and Michael W. Monk, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. 66</page><page sequence="54">760376 - 760378 Many impact tests use some type of pendulum. For example, the compliance test of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 215, the bumper standard of automobiles, is usually conducted by using a parallel linkage pendulum. Since the center of percussion as well as the equivalent impacting mass of the test device are mentioned in the standard, some dynamic characteristics of the pendulum need to be examined. It is found that for a parallel linkage pendulum: (1) There exists no center of percussion regardless where the impact line is on the impacting block; but nevertheless, the summation of horizontal reaction forces in the top supporting hinges reduces drastically when the mass ratio of the impact block and the total masses of the supporting linkages is greater than one. (2) There does exist an optimum impact point to eliminate the rotational effect of the vertical reactions. The impactor would have a translational motion at the instant of impact even if it is suspended by cables when an impact is through this point. The location of this impact point is dependent upon the mass ratio of the impact block and the linkages as well as the distance from the mass center of the impactor to the level of the hinge points on the block. (3) The equivalent impacting mass of the device is equal to the sum of the block mass plus one third of the total linkage mass and it is independent of the impact location on the block. 760376. Converting a Small Car to LNG: What Are the Problems and What Can It Do for Economy and Emissions? W. S. Affleck, G. A. Harrow and W. D. Mills, Shell Research Ltd. (United Kingdom). A two litre compact car originally designed to run on gasoline has been converted to run on LNG. Comparative measurements of fuel economy and exhaust emissions were made for the same car running on each fuel under normal on-the-road and simulated taxi service. When tuned to its maximum economy configuration the LNG car gave significant improvements in fuel economy when expressed on an energy basis. For inter-urban journeys the savings would be of the order of 5% and for taxi type service in excess of 20%. Whether or not these savings would justify fleet conversion would depend on local fuel cost and taxation conditions. When set for maximum economy the LNG car gave significantly lower emissions of CO and hydrocarbons than its gasoline counterpart. Emissions of NOx were, however, higher with LNG than with gasoline. A tenfold reduction in NOx emissions could be obtained by re- tuning the LNG engine to run at air/fuel ratios up to 30: 1. Hydrocarbon emissions with this configuration were, however, quite high and would require supplementary means of control. When tuned to operate at very weak mixtures the car remained quite driveable but was 10 to 15% less economical than when tuned for maximum economy. Although technically practical, the use of LNG is likely to be restricted by supply and distribution limi- tations to fleet operators and other high mileage users who could refuel from centralized points where trained staff would be available. 760377. Single Cylinder Spark Ignition Engine Study of the Octane, Emissions, and Fuel Economy Char- acteristics of Methanol-Gasoline Blends. R. T. Johnson and R. K. Riley, Mechanical Engi- neering Dept., University of Missouri at Rolla. A two phase test program was carried out on a single cylinder, fuel research engine (CFR) to determine the octane, emissions, and fuel economy characteristics of methanol-gasoline blends. The first phase of the work was an evaluation of the octane characteristics of methanol blended with unleaded gasoline. Blends ranging from 2% to 100% by volume methanol for four different base gasolines were knock rated. A simplified mathematical model of the results was developed to aid in comparing the effects of methanol on the octane ratings of the various base fuels. The results indicate that methanol can substantially increase both the Research and Motor Ratings of a relatively low octane unleaded gasoline. However, as the octane rating of the base gasoline is increased, the octane increase produced by the addition of methanol is reduced. For base fuels with Motor Ratings over 85 the addition of methanol has little effect on the Motor Octane rating. Comparisons and data for base fuels having Research Octane Numbers ranging from 81 RON to 98 RON are given. The second phase of the test program was an evaluation of the emissions and fuel economy of a 10% by volume blend of methanol with two base fuels in the single cylinder engine. Clear Indolene and a 95 RON commer- cial gasoline were used for these tests. The results for the Indolene blend are presented since both fuels behaved in a similar manner. Where differences did exist appropriate comments are included. For the blends examined, the specific emissions (gm/ihp-hr) were changed very little by the addition of methanol when the engine was operating at equivalent spark, speed, and stoichiometry. Although the addition of methanol increased the ISFC, the thermal efficiency of the engine was not significantly changed. General conclusions were that a blend of 10% methanol and gasoline demonstrated no significant change in the emissions or energy efficiency over the gasoline fueled engine when operated at equivalent conditions. Under some operating conditions, the addition of methanol could increase the octane rating of the base fuel. This increase could conceivably be enough to reduce knock problems in some vehicles. 760378. A Single-Cylinder Engine Study of Methanol Fuel - Emphasis on Organic Emissions. David L. Hilden and Fred B. Parks, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Exhaust emission and performance characteristics of a single-cylinder engine fueled with methanol are compared to those obtained either with gasoline or a methanol-water blend. Our measurements of engine efficiency and power, 67</page><page sequence="55">760379 - 760401 and CO and NOx emissions agree with trends established in the literature. Consequently, the emphasis is placed on organic emissions (unburned fuel including hydrocarbons, and aldehydes), an area in which there is no consensus in the literature. In all cases with methanol fueling, the unburned fuel (UBF) emissions were virtually all methanol as opposed to hydrocarbon compounds. Without special measures to overcome methanol's large heat of vaporization, UBF emissions were four times greater with methanol than those with gasoline. Similarly, aldehyde emissions were an order of magnitude greater with methanol. These high levels of organic emissions with methanol were related to inadequate fuel-air mixture preparation, which was caused by methanol's large heat of vaporization. Modifying the single-cylinder engine intake system to improve vapori- zation reduced UBF emissions 80 to 90 percent with methanol and 30 to 50 percent with gasoline. Aldehyde emissions were also significantly reduced by improving mixture preparation, but remained three to four times greater for methanol than for gasoline. Blending 10 percent water with methanol resulted in: 1) reduced engine efficiency and power, 2) increased UBF emissions, 3) no measurable effect on aldehyde and CO emissions, and 4) reduced NOx emissions. Our tests indicate that the advantages of blending water with methanol are outweighed by the disadvantages. Discussion: W. J.

A closed loop control system for regulation of engine air-fuel ratio at the stoichiometric value is required for effective operation of a three-way catalytic converter. System performance depends directly on accuracy of the zirconia oxygen sensor which generates a feedback signal for the system. The sensor voltage signal is known to be sensitive to exhaust temperature. In the present inves- tigation, temperature sensitivity of the oxygen sensor was measured over a wide range of engine operating condi- tions. Sensor data were plotted in the form of contour lines of constant sensor voltage as a function of engine air-fuel ratio and exhaust temperature, thereby mapping sensor performance. It was found that, depending on the sensor, a fixed level of sensor voltage shifted from 0.1 to 0.7 ratios towards air-fuel ratios slightly rich of the stoichiometric ratio as exhaust temperature increased from 500°C to 700°C. 1976 SA E Transactions 760398. Multinational Corporations - Ownership and In- vestment. Austin G. Skromme, Massey-Fer- guson, Inc. Multinational corporations have become a very large factor in the economies of most countries. Since WWII manufacturing has displaced selling as the principal activity of MNCs outside their home country. The ownership of parent MNCs is typically centered in their country of origin. Additional capital may be added from earnings, or from borrowings, or equity financing in host or home countries or third countries. The expected shortage and cost of capital will probably be the largest problem MNCs face in the next decade, but their size and financial strength should assure their continued success. 760399. Product Quality: Theory and Practice in Multi- national Approach. Fernando D. Negro, Fiat- Allis Construction Machinery, Inc. The control of product quality is now recognized to involve all functions of the manufacturing company, not only that of inspection. Multinational companies have the problem of esta- blishing a consistent quality assurance system with personnel having widely varying backgrounds and lan- guages. Cultural and economic influences in different countries have produced different responses to the customer's demand for total product quality. To successfully merge these diverse concepts into a practical corporate system, the multinational company must establish a central policy and program. A critical factor is the acceptance and support of the principles of the system by all levels of management. 760400. Engineering Communication in a Multi-National Corporation. Larry F. Moore, Deere &amp; Com- pany. Deere &amp; Company is now using an engineering infor- mation system for communication of routine engineering data. The Worldwide Information System for Engineering (WISE) features a common part data base. On-line remote video terminal and microfiche are used to access data. Input methods used for this system are discussed along with a brief review of new and improved communication tools available today. The data base contains basic information on all parts and identifies company units which use each part. Format and content of the major outputs are described. A portion of the system provides a capability to retrieve existing parts for use in new designs. 1976 SA E Transactions 760401. The Blackwell Story. Frank Klicar and George Bottoms, Forest Preserve District of Du Page County, Illinois. The Blackwell story tells of DuPage County's efforts to preserve scenic natural forests and wildlife for the education and recreation of the public. Instead of destroying man's natural surroundings, the Forest Pre- serve District met the challenge of preserving the envi- ronment with the construction of the Blackwell Preserve. By doing so, the Preserve became an outstanding example of the benefits of multiple use land management. 68</page><page sequence="56">760402-760411 760402. Energy - Past, Present, and Future.

Felix, General Motors of Canada, Ltd. The development of "Off-Highway" rear dump haulage trucks with ever larger payload capacities is governed by the availability of suitable prime movers, transmissions and tires. The adaptation of existing diesel-electric locomotive prime movers and transmissions to the requirements of "Off-Highway" truck applications and the availability of large capacity tires has resulted in the development of a rear dump haulage truck with a 350 ton payload capacity. This paper describes the equipment selection process and highlights some of the product design features. 760409. Estimating Strength Properties of Heat Treated Parts. R. Bruce Hopkins, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The hardenability of steel and the type of heat treatment determine the hardness variations from the surface to the center. Since the strength of steel is directly related to the hardness, values of ultimate strength, yield point, and fatigue limit can be estimated both for the surface and points below the surface from measured hardness values. With the strength properties determined, the load at which yielding will begin can be estimated. S-N curves can also be constructed for failure originating at the surface and below the surface. Applications of the method to through hardened, induction hardened, and case hardened ma- chine components are demonstrated. 1976 SA E Transactions 760410. Dynamic Capacity Rating of Roller Bearings. Michael J. Hartnett, Torrington Co. An engineering discussion of the Lundberg-Palmgren theory of contact fatigue and considerations made therein for the specific case of fatigue life prediction for roller bearings is presented. First, attention is directed toward the selection of the endurance parameter and elaboration is made upon the mechanism by which surface failure is propagated; the concepts of material strength dispersion and stressed volume; and of the Palmgren treatment leading to the concept of dynamic capacity for a contact, with subsequent extension to the cases of rotating and non-rotating raceways and bearing life prediction. Next, AFBMA and ISO standards concerning the dynamic capacity ratings of roller bearings are considered; major assumptions important to the standards development from the fatigue theory, and crucial to the understanding of inherent limitations, are illuminated. Finally, an example is presented whereby life predictions of a roller bearing application, made using exact and standards methods, are contrasted. 760411. Applications of Metallurgical Analysis to Man- ufacturing Problems. Edmund J. Klimek, Roy Co. Ingersoll Research Center, Borg-Warner Corp. There are three primary causes for manufacturing prob- lems that are generally attributed to the material being fabricated: 69</page><page sequence="57">760412-760420 (1) Incomplete specification of the raw material which is usually due to insufficient consideration of both manufacturing and service requirements of the part. (2) Poor or no surveillance to assure conformity to specifications. (3) Lack of understanding and appreciation of the effects of metallurgy and heat treatment on the properties of materials. The results of metallurgical analysis can be applied to aid the manufacturing process by solving current prob- lems and insuring against their recurrence. As such, metallurgy (analysis, material selection and heat treatment) should be considered as a manufacturing process akin to screw machines and stamping presses. 760412. Design and Assembly Considerations for Bolts. Jack Shugart, Rockford Products Corp. Background information and criteria regarding the many aspects to be considered in general fastener applications are reviewed to help determine the best combination of design and assembly parameters. To enable designers to better understand the possible variables in fastener usage, this discussion explains the reasons for such variables, how they affect the strength of the joint and what selections can be made to insure economic results. Test methods and test results in evaluating a joint assembly are reviewed as well as factors involved in different tightening methods and problems arising from improper fastener usage. 760413. Review of Ride Vibration Standards and Tol- erance Criteria. Larry F. Stikeleather, Advanced Technology Center, Allis-Chalmers, Corp. Ride vibration standards should be viewed positively as eliminating some of the confusion which has existed with ride measurement and analysis procedures. On the other hand current standards and criteria should not be accepted at face value yet as being measures of absolute human tolerance. This paper discusses standards and other criteria which deserve application to actual vehicle ride vibration data so that a better understanding of ride can be established in the near future. 1976 SA E Transactions 760415. Whole Body Vibration Levels: A Realistic Base- line for Standards. J. C. Barton and R. E. Hefner, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Statistical measures of whole-body vibration from am- bulation are shown to be higher than those from operation of earthmoving machinery and significantly higher than published guidelines for human exposure to whole-body vibration. The inconsistency of human response to low level vibration of technological origin as compared to human imperceptiveness to high level vibration from ambulation is discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760416. Energy Conservation Through the Utilization of Automation. K. J. Schumacher, Mobile Controls Center, Honeywell, Inc. Automation of certain construction machines will im- prove efficiency and productivity as well as improve operator proficiency. These benefits result in energy conservation through efficient utilization of limited resources.

A User, His Needs. N. L. Teer, Jr., Nello L. Teer Co. The user of construction machinery has one primary interest - the performance of his program of work at the lowest possible cost. The horrendous inflationary cost increases - approx- imately 50% in the past three years - will certainly cause each user to re-evaluate his equipment acquisition pro- gram. One can anticipate that the user will attempt to hold his unit cost line by extending the use-life of each item by placing greater emphasis on improved preventive main- tenance programs. There is an increasing need for improved quality control in the manufacturing process. The users, in general, are experiencing lower availability on new equipment due to faulty components and poor work- manship. These can be largely overcome by greater emphasis on quality control. Government rules and regulations, through their safety and environmental rules, are adding greatly to the capital cost of equipment. Most of this increased cost is not recoverable by increased productivity. In most instances the users' critically short capital is being absorbed by these nonproductive uses that perform little useful purpose. New designs and new models of equipment should be thoroughly tested before releasing for marketing. The user would prefer proven equipment which would include in its base price all development cost rather than the higher operating cost resulting from the additional downtime and extra repair cost. A meaningful warranty could then be put into practice. Repair parts inventories of dealers and manufacturers should be increased to provide for zero back orders, particularly for current equipment. When a machine is down for lack of even one item, it causes economic distress to the user. The user must have access to a satisfactory supply of exchange components. New equip- ment must be designed for ease of component replace- ment and simplicity of field repairs. 760425. Effective Utilization of Horsepower in Mined- Land Reclamation Efforts (Part 2). John Goris, U.S. Bureau of Mines; and John W. Howland, Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. A Specialized Reclamation Field Test using high volume lateral relocation dirt moving blades, under joint spon- sorship of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. was initiated in June 1975. Field tests carried out on an area-mined orphan spoil bank proving ground in southeast Kansas indicate the 40 ft angle blade averages 6,000-6,500 bank yd3 hourly using 795 net flywheel hp in the "push" and "tow" tractors. The 24 ft Vee Plow has demonstrated an earth moving potential of 8,000-10,000 bank yd3 hourly in topping out area-mined spoil banks, and tests are continuing. The 24 ft grading bar has proved effective in smoothing the shaped land and the combination of these three tools together with conventional bulldozers has proved highly effective in reducing costs associated with shaping and leveling area-mined spoil banks. 1976 SA E Transactions 760426. Mining in Siberia - U.S.S.R. with U.S. Manu- factured Construction Machinery. M. H. Gloor, Fiat-Allis Construction Machinery, Inc. The permanently frozen earth (Perma-Frost) that covers much of Siberia has greatly hindered the development of the natural resources located in this vast arctic region. Because of the U.S.S.R.'s state of development of adequate-sized machinery to penetrate the Perma-Frost, the Soviets have been forced to turn to western technology for machinery to mine and develop their resources. This paper describes some of the United States machinery in which the U.S.S.R. is interested. 760427. Use of Heavy Equipment in Sanitary Landfill. Bert Fowler, Waste Management of Illinois, Inc.

Finally, this paper discusses the kind of heavy equipment needed for daily excavation of earth by means of both the trench method and the area method. 760429. Closed Center Hydraulic System For An Artic- ulated Motor Grader. Walter I. Nelson and Joseph Dezelan, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The hydraulic systems for the Caterpillar "G" Series Motor Graders were designed to provide for maximum operator comfort, ease of operation, and optimum control of the vehicle and implements. The use of high pressure closed center systems on these machines produces rapid 71</page><page sequence="59">760430-760451 system response and high hydraulic horsepower to the implement cylinders and motors, and operates with minimum size control components. Components were designed to meet specific system requirements for func- tional performance, reliability of operation, size and placement on the machine. System goals were met through the use of a variable displacement pressure compensated pump, controlled flow four-way implement valves, and a hydrostatic steering system. 1976 SAE Transactions 760430. Recommended Standards for the Service Brakes on Large Trucks in Mountain Mining Service. Graham Walker, University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada). Experience has shown that the conventional service brakes on large mining trucks are not adequate for emergency use when the trucks are used in mountain mining. Following several serious accidents involving runaway vehicles, in Alberta and British Columbia, the regulatory authorities have instituted 'on the road' brake tests both for vehicle type and for annual monitoring. In addition, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board commissioned a technical review of present service brake practice and a study of the requirements when trucks are utilized in mountain mining service. This paper summarizes the recommendations ema- nating from that study for the service brake and emergency brake systems. A rational justification for the recommendations is presented and numerical examples for the various calculations are included. A comparison is drawn of the recommended standards with the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J 166, Minimum Performance Criteria for Brake Systems for Off-Highway Trucks and Wagons. 1976 SAE Transactions 760431. Design of Elastomeric Vibration Isolation Mount- ing Systems for Internal Combustion Engines. Regis V. Schmitt and Charles J. Leingang, Lord Kinematics Div., Lord Corp. The Internal Combustion engine, by nature a dynamic vibration source, requires a properly designed flexible mounting system to isolate those disturbing vibrations. To do this it is necessary to consider all six degrees of freedom of the engine and to use the computer to determine vibratory outputs for given inputs. An example of such a computer program is given. In addition, the design of a mount system requires consideration of static and dynamic force resistance and reduction, motion limitation, environmental resistance and service life requirements. Elastomeric mounts can provide substantial noise reduction but due to the complexity of the noise problem, the prediction of the actual amount of reduction is more of an art than a science. High frequency problems caused by "standing waves" in an elastomeric mount are very much less likely to occur than those due to structural resonances. Examples of noise reductions due to the addition of elastomer mounts, on some actual vehicles, are given. 1976 SAE Transactions 760432.

Value Analysis at Work: A Case Study. Thomas R. King, Mining Machinery Div., Joy Manu- facturing Co. Value Analysis is a discipline which holds considerable promise for reducing product cost while maintaining product integrity. Yet, its use in U.S. Industry is not accelerating at a rate proportionate to its high promise. Much of this has to do with VA's apparent complexity as viewed by nonpractitioners. This paper highlights some problems putting theory into practice and suggests means by which these obstacles can be overcome. A case study is featured describing a group's experience with Value Analysis in progressing from theoretical study through practical application. 760450. Thermal Properties of Thin Laminated Compos- ite Plates. Bert L. Smith, Wichita State Univer- sity. This paper contains the development of a method for determining the coefficients of thermal expansion for the midplane of a thin laminated composite plate. A study is made to show how these coefficients of thermal expansion vary with respect to angle for angle-ply composites. Certain composites can be designed to yield zero coef- ficient of thermal expansion in the principal direction. 760451. Reduction of Pressure Survey Data with Re- gression Analysis. James D. Yost, Rockwell International Corp. A new method has been developed for using regression analysis to obtain equations for aircraft pressure coef- ficients. This method allows wind tunnel or flight test pressure survey data to be collected at a lower cost with accurate coverage of non-linear mach effects. An equation for a given structural location includes mach effects and all other significant independent variables for their full aircraft operational range. Many test conditions are reduced to a few composite variable coefficients which 72</page><page sequence="60">760452 - 760458 may easily be used for further aircraft design conditions for strength or fatigue. 1976 SA E Transactions 760452. Fracture in Thin Sections. J. A. Alic, Wichita State University. While the mechanics of fracture in relatively thick sections of high strength materials is reasonably well understood, thin section fracture is not. Unfortunately, aircraft structures present the designer with many thin section fracture problems. Thus specialized techniques are nec- essary for fracture analysis of aircraft structures. Available methods of thin section fracture analysis are surveyed and critically discussed, with particular attention to crack growth resistance curves. The limitations of assuming linear elastic behavior in many types of thin section problems are pointed out. In such cases a one-parameter fracture criterion is unlikely to be realistic and improved procedures are required. 1976 SA E Transactions 760454. Progress Report on Propeller Aircraft Flyover Noise Research. Frederick B. Metzger and Bernard Magliozzi, Hamilton Standard, Div. United Technologies Corp.; and Robert J. Pegg, NASA - Langley Research Center. The initial results of a program to investigate the sources of noise in unshrouded propellers under forward flight conditions are reported. Tests were conducted using a three-blade, full-scale instrumented propeller mounted on a twin-engine aircraft. Measurements included 1) farfield noise at fixed ground stations and at two aircraft wing tip locations, 2) blade surface pressures at seven locations on one of the propeller blades, 3) atmospheric turbulence encountered by the aircraft in flight, and 4) aircraft operating conditions. The results confirm that signif- icantly lower levels of propeller noise are produced in forward flight than at static conditions. The most significant reductions occurred at midfrequencies which dominate Perceived and A-Weighted Noise Levels. Blade surface pressure data showed the presence of disturbances in the propeller inflow under static conditions which were seen to disappear as the aircraft started its takeoff roll. The blade surface pressure spectra under static conditions were found to contain many peaks at harmonics of propeller shaft speed which showed a general decrease in amplitude with increasing frequency. Levels of blade pressure spectra are higher at the blade tip than at points closer to the hub. Under forward flight conditions, the levels of blade pressure peaks at harmonics of shaft speed drop rapidly at the higher frequencies until a random noise floor is reached at about the 6th harmonic. It is tentatively concluded that propeller noise generation in flight may be dominated by steady loading at blade passage frequency, but at higher frequencies unsteady loading due to interaction with natural atmospheric turbulence may be the dominant mechanism of noise generation. Under static conditions the total noise signature appears to be the result of interaction of the propeller with persistent turbulent eddies passing through the propeller disc. 1976 SA E Transactions 760455. Noise Level Measurements on a Quiet Short Haul Turboprop Transport. F. Cicci, Chief, Structural Research and Noise, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd; and A. F. Toplis, Chief, Operations Analysis, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. The paper describes the early experimental work, the flight test methods and the initial results of the noise measurements for a quiet STOL four engined turboprop aircraft. The target noise level of 95 PNdB at 500 ft sideline at takeoff set some six years earlier in the development process has been achieved. 760456. Noise Control - Blueprint for Better Community Relations. Gordon Gilbert, Business and Com- mercial Aviation. With the exception of a few airliner business jets that do not meet the noise limitations of Federal Aviation Regulations Part 36, the business jet fleet is getting quieter. Today, 80 percent of the 25 models of business jets flying in the United States are within the limitations of the present FAR Part 36. Furthermore, all business jets now in the design phase will be powered by quieter fanjet engines, and all will have sound levels well within the present FAR Part 36 guidelines. Noise rules in force for the current fleet of small propeller-driven business aircraft apply only to aircraft for which type certification application was made after October 10, 1973. All propeller-driven aircraft operating today applied for type-certification before 1973. However, propeller-driven aircraft operators and engineers were concerned with reducing the noise levels long before any regulations existed. Of the current fleet of propeller-driven aircraft, approximately one third fall below the noise limits that will apply in 1980 and beyond. This paper looks at the standing of the business aircraft fleet in relation to FAR Part 36 and examines some of the operational and engineering techniques developed by operators and manufacturers in reducing aircraft noise disturbance over airport communities and to the public in general. The public can be assured that business aircraft are getting quieter. Although much of the past decrease in noise levels can be attributed to operator flying tech- niques, further progress in noise reduction is ultimately in the hands of aircraft, engine and propeller engineers. 760458.

Business Jet Approach Noise Abatement Tech- niques - Flight Test Results. Terrill W. Putnam and Frank W. Burcham, NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. Operational techniques for reducing approach noise from business jet aircraft were evaluated in flight by measuring the noise generated by five such aircraft during modified approaches. Approaches with 4° glide slopes were ap- proximately 4.0 EPNdB quieter than approaches with standard 3° glide slopes. Noise reductions for low-drag 3° approaches varied widely among the airplanes tested; the fleet-weighted reduction was 8.5 EPNdB. Two-segment approaches resulted in noise reductions of 7.0 EPNdB to 8.5 EPNdB 3 nautical miles and 5 nautical miles from touchdown. Pilot workload increased progressively for the 4°, low-drag 3°, and two-segment approach. 760466. The Impact of Interior Cabin Noise on Passenger Acceptance. Ashok N. Rudrapatna and Ira D. Jacobson, Dept. of Engineering Science and Systems, University of Virginia. Based on flight test data gathered in general aviation aircraft, a composite motion-noise, passenger comfort model has been developed which enables the assessment of cabin interior noise impact on passenger acceptance. Relationships between special subject responses and passenger responses are given, as well as the effect of comfort on passenger acceptance. The importance of comfort and noise on the overall passenger reaction is discussed. 760468. Design, Development and Flight Test of the Cessna Citation Thrust Reverser. Alvin C. Allen and Robert J.

New Potentials for Conventional Aircraft When Powered by Hydrogen-Enriched Gasoline. W. A. Menard, P. I. Moynihan and J. H. Rupe, Jet Propulsion Lab., California Institute of Tech- nology. Hydrogen enrichment for aircraft piston engines is under study in a new NASA program. The objective of the program is to determine the feasibility of inflight injection 74</page><page sequence="62">760470 - 760472 of hydrogen in general aviation aircraft engines to reduce fuel consumption and to lower emission levels. A catalytic hydrogen generator will be incorporated as part of the air induction system of a Lycoming turbo- charged engine and will generate hydrogen by breaking down small amounts of the aviation gasoline used in the normal propulsion system. This hydrogen will then be mixed with gasoline and compressed air from the turbocharger before entering the engine combustion chamber. The special properties of the hydrogen-enriched gasoline allow the engine to operate at ultralean fuel/air ratios, resulting in higher efficiencies and hence less fuel consumption. This paper summarizes the results of a systems analysis study. Calculations assuming a Beech Duke aircraft indicate that fuel savings on the order of 20% are possible. An estimate of the potential for the utilization of hydrogen enrichment to control exhaust emissions indi- cates that it may be possible to meet the 1979 Federal emission standards. 1976 SA E Transactions 760470.

The problems associated with the design of such a power plant, which include keeping the cost and weight of a production unit in perspective, are discussed along with the chosen solution. The test results will be published later. 760471. The Mark II Learjet From Concept to Certi- fication. James D. Raisbeck, The Raisbeck Group, Inc. Advanced technology in aerodynamics, both highspeed and lowspeed, are being applied to new airplane designs proposed by Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, and other large aircraft manufacturers. New military aircraft employ the results of many years of exploratory research and development dealing with aerodynamics. Such items as supercritical airfoil technology, sophis- ticated high lift devices, and the optimum integration of various individual airframe components to increase the overall productivity of the larger jet and military aircraft are just now finding their way into the business jet design community. The Mark II Learjet, embodying advanced design features such as blunt wing leading edges employing supercritical aspects, trailing edge flap optimization, and overall wing aerodynamic clean-up was first envisioned by the Raisbeck team in 1973. The Mark II concept, taking the basic Learjet of the 50's and bringing it to true competitive status in important areas of productivity has been the result. These areas include payload/range, cruise speed, low continuing operating costs, and airport oper- ational flexibility. Mark II Learjet conceptual design was followed in early 1974 with "Boiler Plate" leading edge configurations which were tested on a typical Learjet Model 25. Subsequent detail design and flight testing, both under contract to Gates Learjet in late 1974 and early 1975, and final tailoring and certification in cooperation with The Dee Howard Company in mid-to-late 1975 complete the initial Mark II effort. Certified results of the Mark II Learjet are detailed, including reduction in approach speeds, takeoff speeds, and certification to FAR Part 36 without the use of sound suppressors. Fallout gains such as improved stall char- acteristics and reduction in cruise drag on the order of 10% or more are also discussed. The general overview of the application of advanced technology to today's fleet of several thousand jet aircraft is emphasized. 760472. Developmental Flight Test and Certification Details of the Mark II Learjet. Stan Grayson, The Dee Howard Co.; and R. K. Frinell, The Raisbeck Group, Inc. A program to develop and certify a system utilizing advanced technology designed to improve the basic Learjet is discussed. The specific goals of the design included improvement of stall characteristics, reduction in stall speeds, improvement of low speed handling char- acteristics, reduction of takeoff and landing distances, improving the high altitude hot day takeoff performance and reduction of high speed drag. Successful, as well as unsuccessful ideas are discussed, along with the significant FAA certification details including determination of stall speeds, determination of climb performance, and determination of the takeoff and landing distances. 75</page><page sequence="63">760473 - 760480 760473. Laminar Flow Rethink-Using Composite Struc- ture. Henry E. Payne, Bellanca Aircraft Engi- neering, Inc. Analysis of flight test data from the Bellanca Skyrocket IPs F.A.I. World Speed Records indicates that a general aviation aircraft can operate in the laminar flow "drag bucket" on a normal service basis. This is made possible only by utilizing the very smooth and ripple free air passage resulting from a composite sandwich structure. 760474. Minimum Time Flight Profile Optimization for Piston-Engine-Powered Airplanes. Hubert C. Smith, Pennsylvania State University; and Dennis E. Creeden, ECON, Inc. A method is developed for determining the optimum cruising altitude to give minimum overall flight time for a given mission. Variation in aircraft performance, atmos- pheric properties, and winds with altitude are taken into consideration. The solution is performed by digital computer with remote typewriter terminals for input and output. The input is data readily available from the aircraft flight handbook and standard weather service reports. Results show a significant saving in flight time by use of this method over that of cruising at an arbitrary altitude. This result is particularly true in the case of supercharged airplanes operating over stagelengths of about 100 statute miles. 760476. General Aviation Design Synthesis Utilizing Interactive Computer Graphics. Thomas L. Gal- loway, Ames Research Center, NASA; and M. R. Smith, University of Michigan. Interactive computer graphics can greatly enhance the value of computerized aircraft synthesis as a tool for the aircraft designer. In addition to allowing faster and more meaningful input/output, the designer can work with drawings and data in graphical form to produce more meaningful results. This paper discusses the incorporation of computer graphics into a NASA developed general aviation synthesis program and highlights its potential uses in the preliminary design process. 760477. Airfoil Section Drag Reduction at Transonic Speeds by Numerical Optimization. Raymond M. Hicks and Garret N. Vanderplaats, Ames Research Center; Earll M. Murman, Flow Research, Inc.; and Rosa R. King, Computer Sciences Corp. A practical procedure for the design of low drag, transonic airfoils is demonstrated. The procedure uses an optimiza- tion program, based on a gradient algorithm coupled with an aerodynamic analysis program, that solves the full, non-linear potential equation for transonic flow. The procedure is useful for the design of retrofit modifications for drag reduction of existing aircraft as well as for the design of low drag profiles for new aircraft. Results are presented for the modification of four different airfoils to decrease the drag at a given transonic Mach number. 1976 SA E Transactions v 760478. Feasibility Study of Propeller Design for General Aviation by Numerical Optimization. Samuel Bernstein, Flow Research, Inc. A practical method for propeller design using optimiza- tion techniques is presented. The propeller aerodynamics model incorporates blade element, momentum and vortex theories, and the optimization technique is based on a combination of the method of feasible directions and the conjugate-gradient method. A realistic design problem is formulated to maximize the propeller performance in terms of the distribution of thickness, camber, pitch and solidity along the blade, subject to simple structural and power constraints. The application of this method for a general aviation propeller is illustrated by a computed example. The results presented are considered preliminary and are intended only to illustrate this technique. . A discussion of the present aerodynamic model for the blade elements is included, and extensions to more elaborate aerodynamic models are considered. 760479. A Method for Predicting the Drag of Airfoils. Howard L. Chevalier, Aerospace Engineering Dept., Texas A &amp; M University. A new approach is proposed to introduce a change in the physical model of the vorticity on the surface of airfoils which will provide a technique for determining the drag of an infinite span wing throughout the angle of attack range. This approach could provide a method for developing and/or selecting airfoils with lower drag at higher angles of attack to obtain better aircraft maneuver and climb capabilities and can be used to extrapolate small scale wind tunnel tests results accurately to higher Reynolds numbers. In addition, further studies could provide insight into the development of boundary layer control techniques for reducing wing drag. 760480. Statistical Analysis of General Aviation Stall Spin Accidents. Brent W. Silver, Aircraft Safety Consultants. This paper represents the results of a computer study of General Aviation accidents, particularly stall and spin accidents. In an introductory review, five transportation modes are compared on the basis of deaths per 100,000,000 passenger-miles. Of these, General Aviation has the highest accident rate, and domestic airlines the lowest. Descriptions of four "stall-related" accident types (stall, spin, spiral and mush) are given. A summary for these four accident types over the years 1965 through 1973 is given for both twin- and single-engine aircraft. The patterns are found to be similar. Stall/spin accident patterns are reviewed for a group 76</page><page sequence="64">760481 -760494 of 31 single-engine aircraft (1965-1973) by: kind of flying, phase of flight, turning flight, airport proximity, weather, daylight, pilot experience and age, stall warning indicator, and cause of accident. Individual results are presented for the 31 aircraft by make and model. A Chi-Square statistical test shows that some of these aircraft have significantly higher (or lower) stall/spin accident rates than the group mean. Several recommendations are offered for considera- tion in improving General Aviation safety. 760481. Reduction of Stall-Spin Entry Tendencies Through Wing Aerodynamic Design. R. A. Kroeger, The University of Michigan; and T. W. Feistel, NASA Ames Research Center. Results of recent wind tunnel tests and analyses are described which are aimed at helping to prevent spin entry after a stall by modifications to the aircraft wing. Simple add-on devices were utilized which modify the shape of the lift curve after stall, making it essentially flat to 30-40° angle of attack. It is hypothesized that this will greatly reduce the danger of spin entry. Further research will be aimed at laying a firmer theoretical and analytical basis for the approach and at incorporating the complete full scale airplane and its dynamics into the problem. 760482. Reflection-Plane Tests of Spoilers on an Ad- vanced Technology Wing. W. H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. Tests of a finite-span wing with an advanced technology GA(W)-1 airfoil, spoilers, and 30% full-span Fowler flap have been conducted utilizing a reflection-plane model in the WSU low speed wind tunnel. Flap settings from 0° to 40° were tested with a series of 10% chord spoilers of various cross-sectional shapes. Wing force and spoiler hinge moment measurements were made, as well as tuft studies of stalling patterns. Results show that a finite span (aspect ratio 9.5) CLmax value of 3.0 can be obtained with 40° flap at a Reynolds number of 1.0 x 106. Spoiler results correlate well with two-dimensional results, which show that satisfactory roll control can be obtained for all flap settings, with proper lower surface venting. Spoiler gap leak lift and drag penalties were found to be quite substantial, indicating a need for careful design of gaps and seals for flap and spoiler nested configurations. 1976 SA E Transactions 760483. Review of the General Aviation Drag Reduction Workshop. Jan Roskam, University of Kansas. A review is given of the NAS A/Industry /University General Aviation Drag Reduction Workshop which was held at The University of Kansas, July 14-16, 1975. It is shown that large drag reductions can be made, partic- ularly in propeller driven airplanes. It is also shown, however, that existing drag prediction methods are inadequate to cope with propeller driven airplanes. Many unknowns are shown to exist with regard to the problem of designing general aviation airplanes for minimum drag. Several areas for potentially fruitful research are indi- cated. A list of 123 drag references is included. 760486. Lightning Protection of Aircraft Fuel Caps. James Shaw, Shaw Aero Devices, Inc. This paper is submitted to insure that every basic precaution is taken in the design of the installation for an aircraft filler cap and adapter for lightning protection. The axiom in the industry of installing a lightning proof cap solves the problem of a lightning safe installation. However, designers sometimes disregard the problem of the installation of the adapter and the adapters mating parts. Adherence to the FAA and military specifications are considered acceptable while these specifications contain only the bare minimal requirements. This design criteria of only using a lightning safety cap and disre- garding the installation of the adapter sometimes leads to an expensive redesign or retrofit of the aircraft after the plane is in production. 760491. High Altitude Applications of the Gates Learjet. Ronald D. Neal, Gates Learjet Corp. This paper describes two high altitude missions of the Gates Learjet at altitudes up to 50,000 feet. The first application involves the installation of an infrared telescope in support of NASA space exploration projects. The second application concerns the installation of single and dual camera modifications to the airplane for use in aerial mapping missions. Also included in the paper is a brief description of a proposed high altitude research vehicle (HARV) designed for flight operations at 60,000 feet. 760492. GA(W)-2 Airfoil Flight Test Evaluation. Stacy Weislogel, Department of Aviation, The Ohio State University; G. M. Gregorek and M. J. Hoffmann, Department of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, The Ohio State Uni- versity. A brief description of the GA(W)-2 Airfoil Flight Test Evaluation Program is presented. Employing an eco- nomical approach to airfoil flight testing, the GA(W)-2 airfoil was "gloved" on the existing wing structure of a Beech Model C23 "Sundowner". Program objectives, experimental approach, research aircraft modification and instrumentation, data acquisition and processing, flight operations, and preliminary flight test results are de- scribed. 760494. Aircraft Crashworthiness: A Blight or Panacea and Mr. Engineer - Are You Responsible. D. C. Johnston, Jr., Pierce Couch Hendrickson &amp; Short. Civil litigation arising out of claims of defect in design and/or manufacture causing injury has now expanded into a new arena giving rise to claims of defect in design and/or manufacture, increasing the injuries complained 77</page><page sequence="65">760496 - 760505 of, although not causally related. This new doctrine of "CRASHWORTHINESS" or "second injury" evolved first out of automobile accidents, but in the last few years, has been extended to aircraft. Recent Court decisions have indicated a trend toward the adoption of this new doctrine by a majority of the Courts in this Country. This trend will obviously affect the future planning of aircraft manufacturers and engineers who are responsible for programs of research, devel- opment and production changes in the field of crash- worthy design. Secondly, this paper discusses the possible personal liability exposure of the engineer and the method and means by which the engineer may protect himself. 760496. Realistic Evaluation of Landing Gear Shimmy Stabilization by Test and Analysis. Raymond J. Black, Energy Controls Div., Bendix Corp. An experimental and analytical program for prediction of airplane landing gear shimmy stability is outlined. The method makes use of laboratory shimmy tests on a flywheel which simulates the runway and a landing gear mounting structure which simulates the fuselage. Dif- ferences between the laboratory tests and airplane tests are detailed. Because of the latter differences, the prediction of airplane results is carried out by an experimentally verified analysis rather than a direct application of the laboratory test results. The analytical model is outlined including the tire mechanics. Samples of correlation between analytical results and experimental results (laboratory and airplane) are given. 1976 SA E Transactions 760497. Preliminary Flight-Test Results of an Advanced Technology Light Twin-Engine Airplane (ATLIT). Bruce J. Holmes and David L. Kohl- man, University of Kansas; and Harold L. Crane, Langley Research Center, NASA. The present status and flight-test results are presented for the ATLIT airplane. The ATLIT is a Piper PA-34 Seneca I modified by the installation of new wings incorporating the GA(W)-1 (Whitcomb) airfoil, reduced wing area, roll-control spoilers, and full-span Fowler flaps. Flight-test results on stall and spoiler roll character- istics show good agreement with wind-tunnel data. Maximum power-off lift coefficients are greater than 3.0 with flaps deflected 37°. With flaps down, spoiler deflections can produce roll helix angles in excess of 0. 1 1 rad. Flight testing is planned to document climb and cruise performance, and supercritical propeller perform- ance and noise characteristics. The airplane is scheduled for testing in the NASA-Langley Research Center Full- Scale Tunnel. 760500. A Systems Approach to Aviation Safety: FAA Comments on Design for Regulatory Compliance - A Safety System. Robert H. Stanton, FAA, Western Region. The FAA is involved in aircraft design for safety and continued airworthiness, its certification functions con- sisting of making preoperational findings or determina- tions that a product design, a facility, an operation, or a person satisfies the applicable Federal Aviation Regu- lation. This paper, in discussing safety systems, places particular emphasis on the design of aeronautical hard- ware for regulatory compliance. 760501. Design For Regulatory Compliance-A Designer's Viewpoint. Joseph F. Sutter, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. This paper provides an overview of the current air safety design system, focusing on the problems of the design engineer. The design of the 747 is contrasted to that of the 707 and other earlier aircraft to show the ways in which the organizational changes in the FAA and the new pressures placed on this agency by outside groups have affected design procedures. Problems presented by the size and structural changes in the 747 itself are also discussed and alternatives that aircraft manufacturers and designers should explore if the quality of aircraft safety design is to be maintained and improved are stressed. 760503. A Worldwide System to Ensure a Satisfactory Level of Safety. Claude P. J. Frantzen, Secré- tariat d'Etat aux Transports (France). Differences in safety objectives and lack of confidence are the two major obstacles which could have prevented the international development of civil aviation. From the Chicago Convention to the European Joint Airworthiness Requirements, these obstacles have been overcome to the satisfaction of all nations. This stands as an example not only for other aviation matters, but for any field of technical activities faced with international regulatory problems. 760504. Improved Maintenance Practices - The Airlines' Contribution to Lower Ownership Costs. K. Grayson, American Airlines, Inc. From the day the first aircraft carried a revenue producing payload and opened the era of commercial aviation, airline managements have been faced with the problem of reducing aircraft propulsion system maintenance and equipment ownership costs. This paper outlines the major innovative changes in maintenance concepts, philosophy, and practices which have resulted in the airline industry continually meeting these goals, regardless of aircraft/ engine type, size, and technology status. The influence of these changes on past and present aircraft propulsion system designs, their effect on future designs, and additional changes necessary to achieve further improve- ment in aircraft propulsion system ownership or life cycle costs, are also discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760505. Maintenance- An Investment Process. Franklin B. Gattis and G. Philip Sallee, Pratt &amp; Whitney 78</page><page sequence="66">760507-760513 Aircraft Div., United Technologies Corp. Powerplant managers in commercial airlines are under continuous pressure to minimize operating cost. The easiest way to do this, at least for the short term, is believed to be to minimize the cost of each engine repair. Maintenance must be looked upon as a long term investment. Data on JT8D and JT9D engines is presented which supports the hypothesis that spending more per repair will result in a better engine that will run longer between shop visits - reducing the operating costs over the long term. Progress has been made toward substantiating this hypothesis, however, more work is required. 760507. The Influence of Microcomputer Technology on Propulsion Management System Design. Robert D. Porter, Electronic Systems Department, Hamilton Standard Division, United Techno- logies Corporation. The rapid pace of digital electronic technology over the last decade has made practical engine-mounted electronic fuel controls for commercial transports. The current status of digital fuel control technology is presented along with a projection of future systems. The computing power of modern processors makes possible the implementation of extremely complex control modes at modest cost. The ease of using two or more machines in parallel and the capability of the digital computer to test the authenticity of input data leads to interesting techniques for enhancing airworthiness, dispat- chability, and maintainability. 1976 SA E Transactions 760508. Economic Benefits of Digital Electronic Propul- sion Controls for Advanced Commercial Aircraft. G. J. Sevich and D. M. Newirth, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Technologies Corp. The application of digital electronic technology to the control of advanced commercial aircraft engines is expected to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 1% and hot section maintenance costs by as much as 50% because of the ability of electronic controls to operate more precisely than their hydromechanical counterparts. Other advantages, which will accrue from the use of electronic digital controls, will be the virtual elimination of engine control trimming, a greatly simplified interface with aircraft condition monitoring equipment, and more rapid and less costly control maintenance procedures. Digital electronic control is still an emerging technology, but it offers potential benefits which should justify the investment to bring it into commercial service. 760509. Air Transport Propulsion Improvement Oppor- tunities with Advanced Controls. Frederick C. Gray, Power Plant Engineering, Douglas Air- craft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corpora- tion. Experience with contemporary controls for commercial air transport propulsion has uncovered several areas where improvement is desirable. At the same time, advanced electronics show promise when applied in several of these areas. This creates many opportunities to improve air transport propulsion. The question then is: "Which controls improvements should be made first to yield the largest operational and economic benefits?" In advance of detailed analyses, a dozen airlines were surveyed to determine their answer to this question. Based on this survey, an initial set of propulsion control system requirements was derived. These requirements are tomor- row's opportunities for the propulsion controls industry. 1976 SA E Transactions 760510. Factors to be Considered in Applying New Technology in the Airline Environment. Marlowe W. Brecht, United Airlines. Today's economic pressures are mandating accelerated acceptance of new technology by the traditionally con- servative airlines. This paper reviews some of the factors underlying the airlines' apparent conservatism with respect to new technology. Some recent airline experiences with new designs are detailed, and concepts are developed which might help bridge the gap between the design engineer and the engineer in the field. Increased mutual under- standing of this type could expedite the future adoption of new technology by the airlines. 760511. Dynamic Technical Tools - Or Dead Sea Scrolls? William L. McAllister, Flying Tiger Line, Inc. Maintenance programs have rapidly changed from "hard-time" to overhaul to "on condition" or "condition monitoring" control systems. Statistical reporting tech- nology has proliferated at the same pace. In the light of current economic pressures, this paper suggests that a pause in this growth and a review of the cost effects may be advantageous. 760512. Management of Service Deficiencies - A Com- ponent Manufacturers View. Robert C. Curry, Garrett Corp. Most manufacturers who supply the airlines with air- planes, engines or related systems, have organized pro- grams to track the reliability of their products. The manufacturer is very interested in the service history of his product when service deficiencies are reported. He needs failure related information in order to determine what action to take. This paper describes the importance of failure data and describes the process which follows after the existence of a service deficiency is recognized. 760513. An Aircraft Manufacturer's View of Service Problems and Their Correction. Elliott A. Green and Alf S. Lied, Lockheed-California Co. The high equipment investment cost of today's large transport aircraft, the high daily utilization desired or 79</page><page sequence="67">760514-760521 required for profitable operations, and the potential revenue losses associated with service interruptions make it mandatory for the manufacturer to take an active part in the early reduction and correction of service problems. The high investment, not only by the aircraft operators but also by the manufacturer, demands the establishment of a mutual participation team effort for early problem resolution. This paper deals with an aircraft manufacturer's approach to meeting this challenge. It discusses the accumulation and evaluation of service data, the inves- tigations initiated to properly understand the problem, and the management procedures established to assure a safe and speedy problem resolution with a minimum of service interruption. Specific examples are used to illus- trate the types of decisions reached. It also elaborates on the continuous coordination effort required between the aircraft manufacturer and its subcontractors to attain and exceed service reliability objectives. 760514. Managing Service Deficiencies - A Pilot Per- spective. George T. Henderson and Duane G. Teuscher, United Airlines, Inc. Managing service deficiencies is a team effort in the airline business. The Captain's responsibilities and au- thority are directly related to safety and loss control. Service deficiencies are manifested by mechanical, design, procedural and communication shortcomings. Some ex- amples and facts are covered to see how deficiencies can affect an operation in considering the airplane-mission match up and operate a safe transportation system. An aging fleet of airplanes can also present future mechanical problems that have no historical precedence. Fuel costs and supply are having a greater impact in both corporate and national survival. Fuel efficiency becomes an operating watchword and a strong pilot responsibility. Captains are well-trained and provide the discrimi- nating assessment of their equipment based on flight conditions prior to each takeoff. They provide the last line of defense. 760515. Effective Management of In-Service Deficiencies. Bruce Aubin, Air Canada. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process and management technique used by Air Canada to ensure that "in-service deficiencies" do not jeopardize the operations. The review of the procedures and the rationale of the management program is based on objective, perspective, approach, results, and following steps. 760517. Integrated Engine Inlet Thermal Anti-Icing and Environmental Control System (TAI/ECS). A. D. Shah, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The integrated engine inlet thermal anti-icing and envi- ronmental control system (TAI/ECS) for subsonic trans- port airplanes was conceived primarily for the efficient use of available energy and minimum engine bleed air extraction. The concept employs the engine inlet leading edge as the heat exchanger to provide ice protection for the engine inlet surfaces and to cool bleed air for the environmental control system. The results of a study conducted for a typical wide-body airplane using high bypass ratio engines show that the system concept will result in potential improvements in airplane operation and engine maintenance. 1976 SA E Transactions 760518. Environmental Regulations and Their Impact on Airport Development. John R. Goodwin and Lynne P. Sparks, Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration has, as one of the major goals of its Airports Program, the protection and preservation of environmental quality in the expansion and improvement of the Nation's airport system. There are many environmental laws and regulations, the most outstanding being the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which impose requirements on proposed airport projects and which must be complied with before Federal approval can be given. This paper is a survey of environmental regulations that affect airport develop- ment. It is primarily presented from the Federal viewpoint although regional, state, and local requirements are cited. The implications for airport development of each regu- lation is briefly described. The paper concludes with a general commentary on the impact of environmental values and requirements on airport actions. 760520. Feasibility Demonstration of a Turbine Engine Rotor Mounted Electrical Generator. John H. Dower, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Technologies Corp. A feasibility demonstration featuring the integration of a 30 kva electrical generator into a gas turbine engine was successfully completed. The test results demonstrated adequacy of the selected electrical, magnetic and thermal designs. The mechanical design was satisfactory except for a discrepancy in securing the permanent magnet to the generator rotor. Establishing the practicality of integral generators in gas turbines is a step toward improving aircraft and propulsion performance by reducing frontal area, engine and accessory weight and engine airflow blockage by the tower shaft shroud. However, these advantages don't necessarily justify universal adoption. Each prospective application must be confirmed by the increasingly complex process required to optimize aircraft internal power systems. 760521. Powered Wheels for Aircraft. Moses J. Long, Langley Research Center, NASA. The purpose of this paper is to present the engineering details of a drive system now being developed by the Bendix Corp. under contract from NASA Langley Research Center.

Skovholt, Aircraft Equipment Div., Gen- eral Electric Co. This paper discusses an Advance Electronic Display System (ADEDS), built by General Electric, which is representative of the level of present technology which could be utilized to meet an Advanced Integrated Modular Instrumentation System (AIMIS) functional requirements. ADEDS involves very flexible equipment utilizing programmable display processing and generating hardware which is capable of driving multiple displays simultaneously. 760523. Chelsea STOLport - The Airline View. Robin K. Ransone, Dept. of Engineering Science and Systems, University of Virginia. American Airlines' 1970 technical feasibility study of a Floating Interim Manhattan STOLport (FIMS) in the Hudson River adjacent to the residential community of Chelsea met with strong, well organized, effective oppo- sition. The nature of these confrontations, the interactions of the principles, and the lessons learned as viewed by the airline are of value to any project where technological implementation is perceived by the public as a threat to their quality of life. 1976 SA E Transactions 760524. STOL and the Residential Community. Jacque- line Schwartzman, Chelsea Against the STOL- port. This is the story of a community called Chelsea and of an organization called Chelsea Against the STOLport which led a successful fight to keep a STOLport out of its densely populated, highly residential central area in New York City. Our policy statement, to which we have always adhered, is self-explanatory. Chelsea Against the STOLport is a publicly supported community organization opposed to the building of a STOLport in residential areas in center cities. It is for an objective study of the transportation needs of the Northeast Corridor conducted by ecologists, urbanologists and environmental psychologists as well as technologists, taking into account the total effect of such installations on people as well as environment. 760525. Construction and Verification of a Model of Passenger Response to STOL Aircraft Charac- teristics. Ira D. Jacobson, Dept. of Engineering Science and Systems, University of Virginia. A technique for evaluating passenger acceptance of a transportation system's environment has been developed. This includes a model of passenger reaction to the vehicle, as well as the relative satisfaction compared to other system attributes. The technique is applied to two commercial airline operations-a U.S. commuter, and the Canadian Airtransit STOL system. It is demonstrated that system convenience and aircraft interior seating can play a large role in satisfying the passenger. 760526. Passenger Acceptance of STOL - The Airtransit View. Roy B. McCormack, Airtransit Canada. 137,000 passengers have used Airtransit, the Canadian STOL Demonstration, Twin Otter, Service, during 18 months of operation between the downtown centres of two major cities. The majority of passengers have been on business, making short return trips on the average of once a month. Airtransit competes with four other modes of transportation, but is used mostly by people who would otherwise travel by automobile or conventional airline. The features considered most attractive by passengers are good accessibility, shorter total trip time and a high frequency. 1976 SA E Transactions 760527. Aircraft Kerosine vs. Wide-Cut Fuel-Safety Con- siderations. H. W. Carhart, Naval Research Lab; I. Pinkel, Consultant; and J. H. Warren, Mobil Sales and Supply Corp. At the request of the FAA the CRC initiated a study to investigate the effect of fuel volatility on aircraft fire safety. The primary objective was to use new data which have become available over the last ten years to revise and update the 1964 CRC Report on Aviation Fuel Safety. The huge increase in jet aircraft utilization provided a data base for a statistical analysis of accidents; and new data on nonequilibrium conditions involving fuel-air mixtures and fuel electrification facilitated a more complete laboratory study. The results of these two studies were then used to prepare the final report which is summarized in this paper. 1976 SA E Transactions 760528. Jet Fuel in Canadian Operations. L. Gardner and R. B. Whyte, National Research Council of Canada. The usage of aviation turbine fuel in Canadian operations has been the subject of a study sponsored by the Canadian Ministry of Transport. The study was designed to cover all aspects of aircraft operation from ground handling to aircraft in flight and included such parameters as availability and operating costs. Of particular importance was the effect of Canadian climatic conditions on the requirements for aviation turbine fuels for Northern operations. The final report prepared by an engineering consultant was based upon the reports from four sub- groups formed to cover all the aforementioned areas. The final conclusions of the study presented in this paper consider that due to the climatic conditions there is a place for both wide-cut and kerosene fuels in Canadian operations. 760535. Fuel Conservative Propulsion Concepts for Fu- ture Air Transports. D. E. Gray and J. W. Witherspoon, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Technologies Corp. 81</page><page sequence="69">760536 - 760545 In a search for potential methods of reducing future air transport fuel consumption, advanced conventional turbo- fan and more unconventional propulsion systems were examined. Early results encouraged a more detailed evaluation of an advanced Brayton cycle gas generator in a turbofan engine or geared to an advanced multi-bladed, small diameter propeller. The fuel savings potential and operating costs are estimated for the turbofan and turboprop systems to assess both the energy conservation possibilities and the airline economic benefits. 1976 SA E Transactions 760536. Alternative Concepts for Advanced Energy Con- servative Transport Engines. R. Hirschkron and R. E. Neitzel, General Electric Co. Alternative engine concepts to the advanced high bypass turbofan which have promise of reducing energy con- sumption including regenerative cycles and other engines with heat exchangers, unconventional engine arrange- ments such as geared fan engines, and high disc loading turboprops. After initial screening, several concepts were selected for a systematic evaluation of the merits of each relative to a high bypass turbofan based on advanced technology consistent with the mid 1980's time period. Both mission fuel and direct operating cost for typical long range transport missions were considered in the evaluation. 1976 SA E Transactions 760537. Fuel Conservative Potential for the Use of Turboprop Powerplants. Richard L. Foss and John P. Hopkins, Lockheed-California Compa- ny. The turboprop propulsion system may offer the air transportation industry one of the most significant means of achieving reduced operating costs through large reductions in fuel consumption. The prop-fan high speed propeller concept allows the superior propulsive efficiency exhibited by the turboprop to be extended to cruise speeds compatible with current turbofan aircraft. Comparison of a prop-fan and a turbofan powered aircraft, each designed on an equal technology, equal mission and equal comfort basis is used to illustrate the prop-fan benefits. Account- ability for the differences in the installation requirements of each propulsion system is included. The significant fuel and cost improvements shown for the prop-fan aircraft call for an extensive research program to verify the performance of this propulsion concept and to provide a data base that will allow incorporation in future aircraft. 1976 SA E Transactions 760538.

YC-14 Status Report. James J. Foody, Boeing Aerospace Company. The status of the YC-14 program is described in this paper in two respects: (1) progress of the design, development and manufacture of the flight articles; and (2) progress that components of the YC-14 make relative to current goals of the aircraft industry. Technology areas where the YC-14 has made distinct contributions are described and indications are given as to the relative contribution and the remaining potential for development. Such areas include low-speed aerodynamic development, fuel conservative design, flight controls technology, and design-to-cost techniques. In all cases, criteria for incorporation were based not only on tech- nological merit but also on the requirement of minimum life-cycle cost. These elements have been incorporated in an opera- tionally capable aircraft that is concluding its manufac- turing phase on schedule and is about to begin its flight test program. 1976 SA E Transactions 760540. Status Review - YC-15 Advanced Medium STOL Prototype. E. R. Heald, Douglas Aircraft Com- pany, McDonnell Douglas Corporation. In order to explore Advanced Turbo-fan powered STOL technology and to provide a technical and cost base, which would permit decisions for the replacement of C-130 tactical transports, the McDonnell Douglas/ Air Force YC-15 AMST prototypes were authorized. The status of the program and some of the more important findings made through building these prototypes in an X-shop environment and through evaluating the advanced technology which led to their prototyping are summarized. 760542. Airport Jet Fuel Handling and Quality Control. L. C. Quigg, Lockheed Air Terminal Inc.; and J. K. Siddons, American Airlines Inc. The ability to handle large volumes of jet fuel at a modern airport and maintain a high degree of purity requires an integrated Quality Control program. The adverse effects of contaminants on the aircraft systems are described to show the need for planned monitoring of the fuel handling systems. Methods for detecting the various fuel contaminants are described along with the effects of the contaminants on dispensing equipment and storage facilities. Methods for removing and eliminating contaminants and the equipment needed are described. The paper shows how only clean, water-free fuel can be delivered to the aircraft. 760545. Technical and Economical Aspects of Methanol as an Automotive Fuel. A. Koenig, W. Lee and 82</page><page sequence="70">760546 - 760549 W. Bernhardt, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). The results of basic test series conducted on a single- cylinder engine are used to establish the reasons that advocate the introduction of methanol or methanol- gasoline blends as alternative fuel for motor-vehicle operation: lower exhaust emission concentrations, im- proved energy utilization, higher engine output, and improved knock-resistance. Fuel and energy consumption data are submitted for four vehicle concepts operated on methanol fuels, to establish data on the economic aspects of methanol-operated vehicles. It is apparent that the utilization of the anti-knock effects of methanol can lead to competitive gasoline-methanol blend vehicle operation at the present cost of gasoline and methanol. Vehicle operation of pure methanol would offer economic advan- tages over gasoline operation if gasoline is derived from coal. 760546. Performance of Methanol-Gasoline Blends in a Stratified Charge Engine Vehicle. R. T. Johnson, R. K. Riley and M. D. Dalen, Mechanical Engineering Dept., University of Missouri -Rolla. A series of driveability and chassis dynamometer tests were performed using various blends of methanol and gasoline in a stratified charge engine vehicle. The vehicle used was a 1975 Honda Civic CVCC. This vehicle is powered by a prechamber type stratified charge spark ignition engine. The basic intent of this effort was to characterize how methanol-gasoline blends behave in a prechamber strat- ified charge engine vehicle. Since the stratified charge engine was designed to operate at overall lean air fuel ratios, the leaning effect of methanol blended with gasoline might not produce the general degradation of vehicle performance, emissions, and fuel economy re- ported for late model vehicles. The test program was separated into two phases. The first phase was to determine the effect of methanol- gasoline blends on the driveability of the stratified charge engine vehicle. Blends containing 10% to 40% by volume of methanol in gasoline were tested. A weighted demerit system was used to evaluate driveability. Based on this system, vehicle driveability improved slightly with a 10% by volume blend of methanol in gasoline. A 15% by volume blend of methanol yielded vehicle driveability roughly comparable to the base gasoline alone. Further increases in the methanol content produced increased degradation of the driveability. The vehicle would operate on the 40% by volume blend but it was essentially undriveable. Cold weather tests using winter grade gasoline as a base fuel demonstrated that 10% methanol had approximately the same effect on driveability for winter grade fuels as for summer grade fuels. Emissions and fuel economy of the vehicle operating on base fuels and base fuels blended with methanol were evaluated using a chassis dynamometer and the federal urban driving schedule. The addition of 10% methanol to the base fuels produced only very minor changes in the emissions and fuel economy of the vehicle. Not all indicated changes were statistically significant. Generally, HC emissions increased, CO emissions decreased slightly, NOx emissions decreased, and volumetric fuel economy decreased slightly. General conclusions are that the CVCC vehicle tested suffered only slight degradation in driveability using a 10% methanol-gasoline fuel and vehicle emissions and fuel economy are not significantly changed by use of the 10% methanol blend. 760547. Water-Gasoline Fuels - Their Effect on Spark Ignition Engine Emissions and Performance. Bruce D. Peters and Russell F. Stebar, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Single-cylinder engine tests, an analytical engine cycle simulation, and automobile tests were employed to study the effects of supplementing gasoline with water for use in spark ignition engines. Factors examined include: the method of water addition (both water-in-gasoline emul- sions and direct manifold water addition), antiknock characteristics with water addition, MBT spark require- ment, indicated engine efficiency, engine cooling re- quirement, exhaust emissions, volumetric efficiency, lean operating limit, smoke level, exhaust temperature, and vehicle driveability. Among the negative aspects of water addition were increased hydrocarbon emissions and decreased vehicle driveability. Also, the polyoxyethylene type of emulsifier used in the water-in-gasoline emulsions, gave poor fuel stability and caused a rapid buildup of engine deposits. However on the positive side, water- gasoline fuels have higher octane ratings and decrease nitric oxide emissions.

Young, Engine Manufac- tures Association. This study investigates the relative correlation between (1) bare engine sound levels, (2) engine contributing sound levels in the vehicle, and (3) total vehicle sound levels. Common statistical analytical programs are used as the method of correlation. 760549. Exterior Truck Noise Measurements on Turbo- charger Retrofit. John J. Pisarski, Schwitzer Engineered Components, Div., Wallace Murray Corp. Exterior noise level measurements were conducted on a typical in-service diesel engine heavy duty truck to determine the noise level reduction resulting from a turbocharger retrofit. The tests were conducted in ac- cordance with procedures recommended by the Society of 83</page><page sequence="71">760550 - 760555 Automotive Engineers and the United States Department of Transportation. Overall noise level measurements and a narrow-band spectrum analysis indicate that a significant noise level reduction is obtained from the installation of a turbocharger kit. The lower noise level is the result of a smoother pressure development during combustion. The narrow-band analysis shows a significant amplitude reduction at the engine firing frequency and a general decrease in noise energy over the whole frequency range. 760550. Diesel Engine Noise - Basic Studies Lead to Practical Reductions. J. Coulson and R. Southall, Perkins Engines Co. Early work aimed at diesel engine noise reduction is described. This has led to an intensive research pro- gramme to develop a method of predicting engine noise. A special research engine incorporating the latest noise control features is described. The research engine is additionally used to verify the predictive technique, and the analysis completed to date is discussed. 760551. A Study of Fuel Injection Systems in Diesel Engines. Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan); Katsukiko Yokota, Isuzu Motors Co. (Japan); Takeyuki Kamimoto, Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan); and Masanori Igoshi, Japan Soc. for Promotion of Mach. Indus. (Japan). In this study, the authors show their analytical model of the fuel injection system in a diesel engine, which is constructed to be as accurate but as simple as possible and to have good application in the development of new fuel injection systems. In the first part, the authors initially describe the model assumptions, classification of injection phenomena, and fundamental equations considering the compressi- bility, inertia and viscocity of hydraulics and the move- ments of valves and other components to improve the accuracy of the systems. Secondly, regarding the experimental constants and physical properties of the fuel, the authors show the method of selection they used to simplify the analytical model and to get good agreement as a result but without losing physical meanings. Correlations between calculated and experimental results are shown for some areas which have not been carefully investigated before, as follows: (1) sonic velocity in the fuel (2) pressure loss at pipe connections (3) effective area of nozzle hole (4) correction factor of valve area (5) damping factor of valve motion (6) coefficient of restitution of valve at valve seat. 1976 SA E Transactions 760552. A Simulation of Diesel Engine Combustion Noise. Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaido Univer- sity (Japan); Naoya Kojima, Yamaguchi Uni- versity (Japan); and Yu Satomi, Komatsu- Seisakusho Co. (Japan). In the present work, an attempt was made to predict engine noise from the shape of the burning rate curve. Thus, the influence of the shape of the burning rate curve on engine noise, especially on combustion noise was studied in detail and clarification of the relationship was successfully made. At first, an approximation of burning rate curve using a function was attempted. And in second, the transfer rate from cylinder pressure to combustion noise was obtained. Then, the relation between the deciding parameters of burning rate curve and noise and performance of engine were studied. 760553. An Analog Heat Release Computer for Engine Combustion Evaluation. R. A. McFarland and C. D. Wood, Dept. of Engine and Vehicle Re- search, Southwest Research Institute. An inexpensive, easy-to-use analog computer has been designed and built that provides real-time analog signals proportional to combustion heat release, rate of heat release, and other related parameters in operating engines. This paper describes the computer and provides examples of engine data obtained with the computer. 760554. Diesel Exhaust Odor. S. Lesley and C. C. J. French, Ricardo &amp; Co. Ltd. (United Kingdom). The relationship between diesel exhaust odor and build and setting of the engine is reported. Odor was measured by a panel of observers, using a differential technique. Two odors were presented in each test, one from a reference engine, and one from an engine with variable characteristics. The observers were asked to score the difference between the two odors. This technique reduced the effect of random variations in the observers' sensi- tivity. The exhaust was passed through a coarse wire-wool filter before presentation to the observers. Thus the results apply to virtually soot-free exhaust. The observers found that odor decreased as load increased, but increased as speed increased. The catalyst removed a substantial amount of odor, but the remaining variables had a far smaller effect. 1976 SA E Transactions 760555. Computer Simulation of Emission Inspection Procedures - Assessment of Effectiveness. Marcia E. Williams, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency. This paper presents an approach to modeling the emission benefits of an inspection/ maintenance (I/M) program. Emission benefits derived from an I/M program can be expected to be a function of many variables. The model considers the following variables: the level of the standard under which the vehicles were certified and their emission levels at the time of inspection, the vehicle deterioration rate characteristic of both the applied emission control technology and consumer maintenance practices, specifics of the particular I/M program (short test selected along with short test standards), and the quality of repairs made 84</page><page sequence="72">760557 - 760560 by the service industry. The major advantage of such a simulation model is that a wide variety of scenarios can be evaluated and the evaluations can examine time trends as inspection programs stabilize. The model outputs the I/M benefit, (percent and tons) for HC and CO, HC and CO failure rates, HC and CO omission error rates, and HC and CO comission error rates as a function of the number of inspection cycles to which the vehicle population has been subjected. Since the model operates with real emission input data on in-use vehicle populations, it makes no assumptions about the shape of emission distributions. The model was applied to the I/M program design currently in effect in Chicago. Average deterioration rate estimates were used. The model predicts 14 to 26 percent HC improvements for the first year of a mandatory enforced program with benefits increasing to 35 to 56 percent for a stabilized (10 year old) program. CO benefits are 17 to 22 percent and 50 to 66 percent respectively. The range of potential benefit in each case reflects the uncertainty associated with the quality of repair which can be expected from the service industry. 760557. Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance - The Cal- ifornia Program. G. Rubenstein, R. Ingels, R. Weis and A. Wong, California Air Resources Board. Current California law requires the implementation of a mandatory annual vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program in the South Coast Air Basin by 1978. The pilot phase of this inspection program is now in operation in the City of Riverside. This paper evaluates the Riverside program and an alternate program for their abilities to detect gross emitters and provide cost/effective emissions reductions. A surveillance program was conducted to evaluate the Riverside loaded-mode inspection regime and an alternate idle inspection regime. Emissions and fuel economy tests indicated that there was no significant difference between the two regimes. Each regime resulted in immediate reductions on repaired vehicles of 35-40% in hydrocarbon emissions and 30-35% in carbon monoxide emissions, with no significant change in oxides of nitrogen emissions. There was a small (1-4%) improvement in fuel economy, and the average repair cost was $20-25. The more sophisticated diagnostic and repair pro- cedures associated with the loaded-mode inspection regime did not result in improved performance of repairs when compared to the simpler and less expensive idle inspection regime. However with average inspection costs of about $5 per car for the loaded regime and $4 per car for the idle regime, both approaches provided cost/ef- fective reductions in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Other studies indicate that similar reductions are possible on catalyst-equipped vehicles, and that the loaded-mode inspection program has the potential to provide significant reductions in NOx emissions on late model vehicles. 760558. A New Look at Multigraded Diesel Engine Oils. M. F. Smith, Jr., N. Tunkel, H. E. Bachman and W. J. Fernandez, Exxon Chemical Co. Benefits for multigraded oils developed for diesel engine service have been found in performance areas such as low temperature engine cranking/starting, oil consumption rate, bearing wear, and fuel economy in stop-and-go service. Studies continue to indicate that multigraded diesel engine oils should be formulated with a minimum amount of pure polymer, consistent with desired vis- cometric targets, in order to minimize piston deposit formation. Premium multigraded, extended drain lubri- cants depend upon modern viscosity improver technology coupled with improved detergent-inhibitor additive tech- nology. 760559. Scanning Electron Microscope Studies of Cop- per-Lead Bearing Corrosion. D. G. Weetman, K. L. Kreuz, W. W. Hellmuth and H. C. Becker, Texaco Research Center. Scanning Electron Microscopy is a highly effective tool for characterizing the types of corrosion experienced by the surface of copper-lead connecting rod bearings from the CLR engine L-38 Test. Results indicate that the initial corrosive attack on these surfaces is preferentially upon lead; subsequent attack is upon lead and/or copper. Although ethylene dibromide and ethylene dichloride fuel scavengers contribute to corrosion, the presence of halogen on after-test bearing surfaces is not necessarily associated with high bearing weight loss. The effect of ashless dispersants, alkaline detergents and zinc dithio- phosphates on bearing corrosion was also investigated. No relationship was found between additive performance and the generation of additive-derived films on bearing surfaces. 760560. Maximizing Petroleum Utilization Through Ex- tension of Passenger Car Oil Drain Periods - What's Required? W. C. Gergel and T. J. Sheahan, Lubrizol Corp. A study was made of passenger car engine oil drain intervals from 1946 to the present time. The drain intervals were intercompared with engine tests used to gauge oil performance and trends in automotive emission control. Preliminary data from vehicle tests show that the technology may be available to achieve longer drain intervals in today's automobiles. With the stipulation that the extended drain capabilities of an oil formulation must be qualified in relation to the type of service and the type of gasoline used (i.e., leaded or unleaded fuel), taxicab data show that higher quality levels than current API SE are needed to double today's recommended oil change intervals. Engine wear appears to be the major technical limitation on extending oil change intervals. Other technical limitations are control of engine deposits and resistance to oil thickening. 85</page><page sequence="73">760561 -760564 760561. Synthetic Automotive Engine Oils From a Con- sultant's Experience. R. I. Potter, Ray Potter and Associates. This paper reviews complete performance results of a 100,000 nn¿e field test with a diester synthetic oil run for five years under "no drain" conditions in a Lincoln Continental. Thus the author considers it a lifetime engine oil. The paper also describes two additional candidate synthetic oils under testing. Performance Correlation Curves between extended Sequence Engine Oil Tests and field results are compiled. The need for meaningful pre-performance engine tests for lifetime engine oils is stressed, which now require some five years in field evaluation. Other benefits of successful pre-performance tested synthetic engine oils are excellent deposit sup- pression, low wear, low temperature fluidity, easy low temperature starting and warmup, octane requirement reduction, and probable antifreeze tolerance. 760562. The Effects of Phosphorus-Containing Engine Oil Additives on Exhaust Oxidation Catalyst Deg- radation. F. Caracciolo and J. A. Spearot, General Motors Corp. Catalyst deterioration caused by phosphorus-containing engine oil additives was investigated using a variety of engine oil blends in a steady-state engine-dynamometer test. The reductions in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide conversion in the 200-hour test were related to two parameters: 1) the quantity of phosphorus in the oil added to the engine, and 2) the amount of phosphorus on the catalyst at the end of the test. Catalyst degradation relative to the first parameter differed from that relative to the second because the two parameters were not directly related. Specifically, catalyst conversion efficiency decreased nonlinearly with the amount of oil-derived phosphorus added to the engine, but linearly with the amount of oil-derived phosphorus found on the catalyst. A higher percentage of phosphorus added to the engine was found on the catalyst with oils containing tricresylphosphate (TCP) than with oils con- taining zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDP). For a fixed amount of phosphorus on the catalyst, however, oils containing ZDP were more harmful to catalyst per- formance than oils containing TCP. For most oils containing ZDP, phosphorus was observed to accumulate in sump oil during engine operation. As a result, less phosphorus than that added to the engine was responsible for the decrease in catalyst conversion efficiencies observed with these oils. 1976 SA E Transactions 760563. Concentrations of Nitrogen Oxides in Crankcase Gases. James A. Spearot and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO -I- N02) in engine crankcases interest lubricant techno- logists because NOx reactions with fuel and lubricant components are partially responsible for engine deposits and oil deterioration. To provide information hitherto unavailable in the literature, concentrations of NOx and N02 were measured in the crankcase gas of a multi- cylinder engine operated at a variety of steady-state conditions. The concentrations of NOx and N02 measured in the crankcase gas followed the same trends with changes in engine operating variables as the concentrations of NOx and N02 in the exhaust gas. Specifically, increasing intake manifold pressure, spark advance, and compression ratio, generally increased the concentrations of NOx and N02. Increasing the percent exhaust gas recirculation, however, decreased NOx and N02 concentrations. Changing air-fuel ratio (A/F) from rich to lean first increased and then decreased crankcase NOx and N02 concentrations; the maximum NOx and N02 concentration occurred at an A/F of about 16. Engine speed affected NOx and N02 concentrations slightly and inconsistently. Measured NOx and N02 concentrations in the crank- case gases were in the range 8.7 to 376 and 0.3 to 125 ppm, respectively. Crankcase NOx and N02 concentrations could not be predicted from those measured in the exhaust gases because the sources of NOx and N02 are not identical for both crankcase and exhaust gases. Quench gases in the combustion chambers appear to be a significant source of crankcase NOx, and probably a primary source of crankcase N02. Some N02 is also formed in the crankcase itself from oxidation of NO. 1976 SA E Transactions 760564. The Vapipe - A Practical System for Producing Homogeneous Gasoline-Air Mixtures. G. A. Harrow, W. D. Mills and A. Thomas, Thornton Research Centre, Shell Research Ltd. (United Kingdom); and I. C. Finlay, National Engi- neering Laboratory (Scotland). The Vapipe is a device that has been developed jointly by Shell Research Limited, Thornton Research Centre, and the National Engineering Laboratory to reduce car exhaust emissions and improve fuel economy. It achieves better mixing of the charge entering the engine by vaporizing the gasoline in the inlet system. Heat for this purpose is conveyed from the exhaust system by means of a heat pipe. The heat pipe must be designed to cater for the possibility of gross mismatch between the heat available from the engine exhaust and the heat needed to vaporize the fuel. This can occur under transient conditions of engine operation. Two Vapipe systems have been tested, one in which surplus heat from the exhaust is rejected to the cooling system of the car and the second in which the boiler efficiency is varied to maintain the correct flow of heat to the fuel vaporizer. Both systems operate well but the latter is very much cheaper to make than the former. Prototype Vapipes have been constructed and tested on test-bed engines, in cars on the road and on chassis dynamometers. 86</page><page sequence="74">760565 - 760570 The Vapipe provides good mixture distribution and allows the engine to run smoothly at weak mixtures, thus permitting improvements in fuel economy and reductions in exhaust emissions. Substantial benefits have been obtained in practical installations, but these could be even greater if carburetters or other fuel-metering devices were developed to take maximum advantage of the homo- geneous mixtures. Significant improvements in engine warm-up time, driveability, and flexibility of operation are also achieved but power output is somewhat reduced. Progress has been made towards simplifying the design of the Vapipe and making the unit more compact. 1976 SA E Transactions 760565. Heat Pipe Early Fuel Evaporation. John L. Harned, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Heat pipes for providing early fuel evaporation (EFE) are evaluated. Two design concepts for using heat pipes in the EFE application are described. It was found that a heat pipe can be used as a self-regulating EFE system without direct coupling of intake and exhaust manifolds, at some sacrifice in warm-up rate from that of direct exhaust heat. A 1360 kg car equipped with an emission control system composed of lean mixture carburetion, heat pipe EFE and exhaust gas recirculation achieved emission levels of 0.7 gpm HC, 5.8 gpm CO, 1.7 gpm NOx on 1975 FTP with good cold start driveability. 760566. A Heat Pipe Controlled-Temperature Combustor for Low Nitric Oxide Emissions. Dean C. Ham- mond, Jr. and James N. Mattavi, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The use of a heat pipe to control nitric oxide formation in the post-flame gases of a continuous-flow combustor was investigated for steady-state conditions. Analytical mod- eling of such a device predicted that emission levels of nitric oxide formed in the post-flame gases would be several orders of magnitude lower than those associated with an uncontrolled case. The general compatibility of a heat pipe with such a high-temperature environment was demonstrated by exposing a sodium heat pipe to a propane-air flame for 1000 hours with no measurable degradation in perform- ance. The quantity of nitric oxide formed in the flame front may be substantial in some combustors and is not amenable to reduction by the heat pipe concept of this study. Transient operation is another potential problem area for vehicular applications of the study combustor. 760568. Hydrogen Automotive Fuel: Production and Delivery. J. B. Pangborn and T. D. Donakowski, Institute of Gas Technology. Today's principal and cheapest source of hydrogen in the United States, steam-reformed natural gas, does not have attractive prospects in the far-term future. Alternative procedures or processes therefore are in various phases of research and development. Hydrogen can be produced by the electrolysis of water, and production of hydrogen from coal and water is under study. Thermochemical, pho- tochemical, and biochemical procedures are being re- searched as long-term routes to hydrogen. Feasibility studies indicate the possibility of long- distance transmission of hydrogen gas via pipeline. Local distribution of hydrogen fuel presents a major problem that requires investigation and development. Technically and economically, other synthetic fuels, such as liquid hydrocarbons from coal or oil shale, are favored alter- native automotive fuels for the mid-term future. 760569. Metal Hydride Storage for Mobile and Stationary Applications. K. C. Hoffman, J. J. Reilly, F. J. Salzano, C. H. Waide, R. H. Wiswall and W. E. Winsche, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Associated Universities, Inc. Metal hydrides offer the possibility of a convenient and safe method for the storage of hydrogen. These com- pounds provide for compact storage in a form that is equal to or better than cryogenic liquid hydrogen on a volume basis. Considerable research has gone into the study of hydrides derived from rare earth, iton-titanium, and magnesium alloys. The formation of these compounds is reversible and the chemistry of relevant hydrides has been discussed. Heat must be provided to decompose these compounds and release the hydrogen, while heat is liberated when the compounds are formed and must be removed to allow the hydriding reactions to proceed to completion. The iron-titanium and magnesium alloys are especially promising hydride storage media, the former in stationary applications, or where weight is not a limiting consid- eration, and the latter for mobile applications. Each of these materials has unique pressure-temperature char- acteristics and reaction kinetics which must be considered in the design of a hydrogen storage system. These special characteristics are discussed for particular applications. The results of recent work on hydrogen storage devel- opment and the engineering design of storage systems are reviewed. 760570. Hydrogen Storage in Vehicles - An Operational Comparison of Alternative Prototypes. Ronald L. Woolley and Harold M. Simons, Billings Energy Research Corp. Performance and operational characteristics of several prototype containers for storing hydrogen are described. A cryogenic vessel and three metal hydride containers of similar design but different size have been used in automotive service. Hydrogen release rates were con- trolled to match with engine demand. All prototypes were able to sustain a steady state flow rate sufficient for vehicle operation at normal cruise speed. In order to illustrate the principle of hydride operation, a pres- sure-temperature history for recharge of a small portable hydride tank is given along with several discharge curves with and without heating. 87</page><page sequence="75">760571 -760582 760571. Recent Progress in the Hydrogen Engine. Wil- liam J. D. Escher, Escher Technology Associ- ates; and E. Eugene Ecklund, U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration. Developments in the energy and environmental sectors have awakened interest in hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines. Based on a 50-engine survey of recent U.S. research and demonstration activities, the technical status of hydrogen engines is summarized. A comparative hydrogen/conventional-fuel orientation is maintained in assessing basic fuel property, engine power and efficiency, emissions and general operating charac- teristics. Key theoretical and experimental results, and corre- lations where evident, are noted. Engine problem areas and their solutions are discussed, accompanied by some thoughts toward future development possibilities and supporting research needs. 760572. Hydrogen Fuel in the Subcompact Automobile. Roger E. Billings, Billings Energy Research Corp. Recent advances in hydrogen energy technology have made possible the consideration of a subcompact auto- mobile utilizing metal hydrides, or powdered hydrogen storage, and a low cost electrolyzer for vehicle recharging. Basic considerations of the metal hydride automotive system are discussed regarding various vehicular proto- types. Particular emphasis is placed on a hydrogen minicar application. Utilizing a low cost electrolyzer and utility grid electricity for vehicle recharging, it is possible to make a comparison of the metal hydride hydrogen engine system with other electric vehicles on the basis of storage weight, vehicle range, and cost of operation. 760573. Advances in Hydraulic Oil Additive Technology. Andrew G. Papay, Edwin Cooper, Inc. The status of hydraulic oil additive technology is briefly reviewed with emphasis on recent advances. New test methods now being introduced into the industry are examined and results of comparative testing presented. A comprehensive analysis and performance comparison is made of the two main technologies: ashless and zinc dithiophosphate. It is shown that the ashless (S, P) approach is superior to the zinc-based one in most performance areas and offers industry the option for a truly multipurpose hydraulic oil. 760574. Extended Life for Transmission Components Through Limited Air Breathing. F. A. Christian- sen, Chevron Research Co., J. R. Dunn, Polysar Ltd.; and W. D. Ross, Ford Motor Co. Eight Ford C6 transmissions were operated in a San Francisco cab fleet for up to 89,000 miles (143,000 km) with zero, or minimal fluid make-up and with the transmissions effectively sealed to prevent air breathing. The aftertest condition of the fluid and of the synthetic rubber seals differs sufficiently from all similar test experienced, with the single exception of the data presented in the TABS valve paper (1), that it warrants discussion in detail as presented in this paper. 760575. Foaming and Air Entrainment in Automatic Transmission Fluids. L. T. Dixon and S. Korcek, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., Ford Motor Co. The Ford Dynamic Aeration Test Apparatus is used to evaluate the foaming, air entrainment and air release properties of selected automatic transmission fluids. By this method it is possible to evaluate fluids under conditions which approach those of the automatic trans- mission operation. The effects of changes in aeration rate, temperature, pressure and air humidity on the foaming and air entrainment characteristics are evaluated and a rating procedure for automatic transmission fluid behavior is suggested. 760576. (SP-408) Cooperative Research. M. K. McLeod, Coordinating Research Council, Inc. This paper presents the basic concepts of cooperative research, its development of the automotive and petro- leum industries, and some problems it encounters. It also describes how cooperative research can serve an even larger and more important role in the solution of very complex problems that face the world today. 760581. Comparisons of Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Consumption Characteristics - 1974 and 1975 California Automobiles. Michael R. Appleby, Louis J. Bintz and Thomas A. Tappenden, Automobile Club of Southern California. Exhaust emission and fuel consumption data for 1974 and 1975 California automobiles were generated using the EPA Federal Test Procedure. Fuel consumption data were also generated from a highway cycle test and in-service vehicle fleet records. Emission test results indicate the degree of control achieved when compared to previous model year auto- mobiles. Fuel consumption data comparisons were made among published data, data calculated using the indirect approved method, a direct method, and in-service fleet vehicle records. Conclusions discuss emission reductions achieved and the cost of future reductions. Further research to inves- tigate fuel consumption measurement methods is sug- gested. 760582. Not Available in California. Eric P. Grant, Attorney at Law and Consultant. An emission control program that concentrates solely on increasing the stringency of emission control standards for manufacturers and fails to enforce adequate maintenance of in-use vehicles cannot be effective. This paper advo- cates a new approach, which would hold emission control standards at their present levels and establish mandatory annual vehicle inspections in all states. These yearly 88</page><page sequence="76">760583 - 760592 inspections would also assist in energy conservation since improved vehicle maintenance often results in greater fuel economy. 760583. Los Angeles Air Is Much Cleaner. Miles L. Brubacher, Consulting Engineer. This paper presents air monitoring data and references which show the following: Los Angeles photochemical and auto-caused air pollution is by far the worst in the U.S. Due to the control programs, Los Angeles air is much cleaner. The improvements are dramatic in the last few years. Downwind stations, such as Riverside, never had such high air pollution levels as Pasadena, and Riverside now is showing decreased levels. Sulfur dioxide and sulfate levels are not likely to reach as high levels in the early 1980's as were reached in the early 1950's before sulfur was limited in fuel oil. 760584. Engineering Options In The Choice Of Auto- motive Fuels In The Next Decade. R. W. Hum, Energy Research and Development Adminis- tration, Bartlesville Energy Research Center, Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Within the next decade there may be significant devel- opments toward "new" automotive fuels-either alter- native fuel forms or traditional fuels from non-petroleum sources. These include methanol as the most likely alternative fuel form, hydrocarbons from coal or from oil shale, and modified conventional fuels from either traditional or alternative sources. The characteristics of traditional fuels will not change significantly solely as a result of using synthetic crude in refinery feedstocks. Increased use of distillate transportation fuels could result in process energy savings, but, measured roughly, beyond a 1 : 1 distillate/gasoline ratio, increased automotive diesel demand may involve process energy penalty. 760585. The Economy and Convenience of Mechanical Transmissions. E. A. Richards, Transmission Div., Eaton Corp. Transmissions are essential in adapting the characteristics of a power plant to the requirements of a wheeled vehicle. The evolutionary process has produced a variety of mechanical gearing arrangements for serving this purpose. There is evidence that the evolutionary process will remain active and that innovative developments will continue to be offered to transmission users. 760586. Mechana-Power: A New Approach to Infinitely Variable Transmissions (Domestic and Foreign Patents in Process). Laird G. Gogins and Christopher P. Russell, Power-Matic Corp. This paper describes Mechana-Power Drive (MPD), a new concept for a continuously variable transmission. MPD is comprised of a variable throw crank linked to a plurality of hydraulic ratchets gear coupled to each other and to the load. Output speeds range from 2.5 times engine speed down to zero for both forward and reverse. Measured efficiency ranges between 92% and 96% and the transmission drives from either the input or the output end. There is no practical power limit in the concept. 1976 SA E Transactions 760587. Air Brake System Trends For The 80's. J. P. Koenig and R. D. Kreider, Bendix Heavy Vehicle Systems Group. The air brake system of the 1980's will evolve from the present design because of forces acting on the vehicle manufacturer through the government, the trucking industry and the component industry. Changes will occur to improve safety/performance, maintenance, vehicle efficiency, reduce noise and maintain vehicle compati- bility. All of these factors will dictate the cost effective designs of the 1980's. 760589. Sailplanes: The State-of-the-Art. Harry N. Perl, Northern California Soaring Association. The development of modern high performance sailplanes is traced from the early experiments and studies of Cay ley, Lilienthal, Chanute, and the Wright Brothers, using the glider as a test vehicle, to the highly sophisticated soaring machines of today. Various design features and param- eters are described as are current performance charac- teristics and capabilities. 760590. The Pazmany PL-2 and PL-4 Airplanes. Ladislao Pazmany, Pazmany Aircraft Corp. Aerodynamic and structural considerations in the design of these two airplanes are compared with other light aircraft designs. The designer-builder relationship has some effect on the selection of configurations, materials and construction methods. The designer has the task of taking the many compromises between performance, safety, structural integrity, and weight. The PL-2 is not only built by amateurs and flown for recreation, but it is also used as a military trainer in several Asiatic countries. The PL-4, also built by amateurs, has been flown as a sport aircraft, and also selected as an advanced Air Cadet Trainer in Canada. 760592. Fuel Economy of Light-Duty Diesel Vehicles. R. D. Fleming, Bartlesville Energy Research Cen- ter. Fuel economy and emission characteristics of two light- duty diesel-powered vehicles, representing 3,500-lb and 5,500-lb passenger cars, were determined and compared to those of similar 1975 model year gasoline-powered vehicles. The diesel-powered and gasoline-powered vehi- cles were designed to have comparable acceleration performance. The 3,500-lb vehicle with a 247 cubic-inch-displace- ment (CID) diesel engine and the 5,500-lb vehicle with a 636-CID diesel engine gave respectively, 43% and 33% better combined city /highway fuel economy than similar 89</page><page sequence="77">760593 - 760604 vehicles with 250-CID and 440-CID 1975 model year gasoline engines. In the 3,500-lb vehicle, emissions both from the diesel and gasoline engine were below the 1976 Federal emission standard. Emissions from the 5,500-lb vehicle both with the diesel and with the gasoline engine exceeded the 1976 standard. The potential for meeting standards more stringent than those for 1976 was not investigated for either gasoline or diesel-powered versions. Additional work was done with a 3,500-lb vehicle (198-CID diesel) and a 247-CID diesel engine mounted on a dynamometer stand using turbocharging, combined supercharging/turbo-charging and varied engine-to-ve- hicle speed ratio as experimental variables. The results in terms of fuel economy, emissions, and vehicle perform- ance are discussed. 760593. An Equipment Supplier's View on Regulations. John W. Kourik, Wagner Electric Corp. Equipment suppliers have both generated and accom- modated to evolutionary changes as regulations evolved with advances in the state-of-the-art. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards have revolutionized the equip- ment suppliers' interest in Regulations. The scope and activity of groups within the NHTSA is reviewed to show the impact of the performance, design and quality assurance aspects of such Standards at the equipment supplier level. Compliance and defect respon- sibilities are discussed. Specific examples have been selected from experience with FMVSS 121 - Air Brake Systems. 760598. Winterization of Construction Equipment for Arctic Operations to -55° Under Severe Con- ditions. James C. Burrous, Ordnance Engineer- ing Div., FMC Corp. The paper discusses general winterization requirements for construction equipment used in the Arctic at temper- atures down to -55° Fahrenheit. The information is presented in a practical sense and was obtained from on-site experience around the North Slope of Alaska and Prudhoe Bay. 760599. Meeting European Noise Regulations for Rub- ber-Tired Front End Loaders. Donald F. Rudny, Pay Line Div., International Harvester. Major legislation has been established in Europe gov- erning the noise levels of heavy construction equipment. Level limits, test procedures, data acquisition techniques, and future legislation of several European countries are presented specifically for rubber tired front end loaders. Techniques utilized in determining problem source components and methods employed in attenuation of the vehicle to comply with the existing legislation are also discussed. Special attention is given to the spectator level where the regulation limits are most stringent. However, many of the modifications shown are also effective in reducing operator station noise levels. 1976 SA E Transactions 760600. A Systematic Approach to Noise Reduction of Army Fork Lift Trucks. Edward F. Ellingson, Advanced Technology Center, Allis-Chalmers Corp. This report discusses work performed under government contract to study and reduce noise emission of Army 6000 lb capacity fork lift trucks. Sound levels of stock fork lift trucks were studied in detail including operator exposure. Contributing noise sources were identified and studied, and several abate- ment techniques were established for each source. A novel approach was used to analyze the interaction of various techniques, and a "kit" or combination of source abatement techniques was analyzed for its overall effect on sound level and cost. After a complete study, the lowest cost kit was selected and prototypes procurred for verification tests. 760601. Noise Control on a Heavy-Duty Mobile Crane. J. R. Bernhagen, Harnischfeger Corp. The intent of this paper is to illustrate how simple testing techniques and application of elementary noise concepts helped attenuate the noise in the operator cabs of a heavy-duty mobile crane to within the 8 hour/90 dBA limit established by the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970. 760602. An Integrated Approach to Measurement of Exhaust and Intake Noise. D. A. Olson, D. C. Flanders and L. J. Eriksson, Corporate Research Dept., Nelson Industries, Inc. An integrated approach for measurement of exhaust and intake noise during a single test is presented and typical results discussed. Internal pressure waveforms as well as external radiated noise are included for various intake and exhaust systems. 760603. Interior Noise Problems of Small Diesel-Powered Buses. Gary L. Marlotte, H. L. Blachford, Inc. This paper discusses interior noise problems characteristic of the combination of diesel engines with typical small bus geometries. One noise problem is the potential for low-frequency resonances. Natural air vibration modes for typical small bus interior dimensions are calculated and shown to give frequencies that can be stimulated by noise and vibration at engine firing frequencies. Measurements of noise and vibration at resonance are given. Other noise problems are associated with internal front engine covers, and leaks and low transmission loss paths in the console area. Some practical suggestions, with examples, are given to reduce interior noise. 760604. (SP-409) Early IC and Automotive Engines. C. Lyle Cummins, Jr., Carnot Press. Selected pre- 1900 IC engines and automotive engines of the 1900-1920 era are briefly described. The pre- 1900 list includes atmospheric, non-compression, Brayton and the 90</page><page sequence="78">760605-760611 Otto four-stroke cycle engine. Performance data and pressure- volume diagrams of the various types are given. Emphasized in the section covering the first automobile engines are the limitations and difficulties imposed by available fuels, deficiencies in ignition, carburetion, combustion chamber design, etc., and how some of these problem areas were improved. 1976 SA E Transactions 760605. (SP-409) The Automobile Engine 1920-1950. J. G. G. Hempson, Ricardo &amp; Co., Ltd. (United Kingdom). The paper endeavours to trace the development of the passenger car engine over the three decades, 1920 to 1950. Both American and European practices are reviewed. In particular, the relation of fuel quality to engine design is emphasised as an important factor. The gasoline truck engine is briefly referred to where there were differences from passenger car practice, but the introduction of the Diesel (compression ignition) truck engine and its wide- spread adoption in Europe is treated at greater length. 760606. (SP-409) Current Developments in Spark-Igni- tion Engines. John B. Heywood and Rodney J. Tabaczyniski, Sloan Automotive Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This paper reviews the major changes that have occurred in spark-ignition engine design and operation over the last two decades. The automobile air pollution problem, automobile emission standards, and automobile fuel economy standards- the factors which have and are producing these changes- are briefly described. The major components in spark-ignition engine emission control systems are outlined, and advances in carburetion, fuel injection, ignition systems, spark retard and exhaust gas recycle strategies, and catalytic converters, are reviewed. The impact of these emission controls on vehicle fuel economy is assessed. The potential for fuel economy improvements in conventional spark-ignition engines is examined, and promising developments in improved engine and vehicle matching are outlined. Finally, the operating characteristics of alternative spark-ignition engines-the Wankel and several stratified charge en- gines-which are competing with the conventional engine, are briefly discussed. 760607. (SP-409) Future Automotive Power Plants. George J. Huebner, Jr., Chrysler Corp. As a result of the energy crisis, both alternative fuels and alternative powerplants have been proposed, often with- out regard to engine/fuel compatibility and availability or the realities of manufacturing and marketing. The major developments in both powerplants and fuels are evaluated and compared to the spark ignition engine and hydro- carbon fuels in terms of fuel economy, emissions, and performance. 760608. Other Engines, Other Fuels: An Overview. L. S. Caretto, California State University-Northridge. The current state of development of several alternative engines for light-duty ground transportation is reviewed. The development of such engines will affect the intro- duction of various types of fuels, and the availability of fuels may place restrictions on the type of engine used. The interdependence of fuel and engine types is consid- ered. Although the introduction of new engines will change the fuel-use pattern, continued use of present spark-ignition engines will require a continued supply of high-octane fuels. 760609. Hydrogen: Primary or Supplementary Fuel for Automotive Engines. Joseph G. Finegold, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. Hydrogen, gasoline, and mixtures thereof were compared as fuels for lean-burn engines. Hydrogen for the mixed fuels tests was generated by partial oxidation of gasoline. Hydrogen combustion yielded the highest thermal effi- ciency at any NOx level. Gasoline yielded the second highest thermal efficiency for NOx levels greater than or approximately equal to two gm/mi. For lower NOx levels and high vehicle inertia weights, progressively more hydrogen supplementation was the second most efficient system. For vehicle inertia weights below 5000 lbm (2300 kg), the statutory NOx standard (0.4 gm/mi) could be met with one lb/hr (0.13 g/s) hydrogen supplementation. 760610. Engines for Tomorrow's Passenger Cars. J. D. Withrow, Jr. and J. P. Franceschina, Chrysler Corporation. The dual goals of low emissions and improved fuel economy have raised concern over the spark ignition engine's ultimate capability to meet our country's long- term social needs. This has heightened the interest in alternate powerplants for passenger cars. There are eight types of powerplants that merit serious consideration in the next twelve years that will be discussed. Each of the candidates represent a unique set of trade-offs and risk. The candidates will be arranged in the following cate- gories: current or near- term technology, advanced heat engine technology, and new technology. Engineering, legal, economic, and social factors will be discussed for each category. 760611. Rotary Engine Combustion With Hydrogen Ad- dition. J. E. Cichanowicz and R. F. Sawyer, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of California-Berkeley. The lean operating limit of a rotary combustion engine was extended by hydrogen-enriched fuel to equivalence ratios as low as 0.49. Reductions in NOx and CO emissions from baseline conditions were observed, al- though HC emissions increased significantly. The effect of hydrogen-induced lean combustion on indicated thermal efficiency was found to be dependent 91</page><page sequence="79">760613-760620 on the change in H2/C8H18 fraction with decreasing equivalence ratio. An increase in H2/C8H18 fraction with decreasing equivalence ratio had little effect on indicated thermal efficiency, whereas a constant or decreasing H2/C8H18 fraction led to a marked decrease. The brake thermal efficiency when compared at constant power increased marginally. 760613. A Business Approach to Buying Trucks. Sal R. Galluzzo, Freightliner Corp. The paper discusses the fact that in a year when economic conditions might be saying "don't buy", there may be good business reasons to buy trucks. It is based on a study made with the cooperation of a truck operator who permitted the analysis of all aspects of his operation. After the study, the operator did buy trucks in a year when, on the surface, it appeared new truck purchases wouldn't be justified because of economic conditions. The operator also changed his buying pattern from his past practice of glider kitting trucks for replacement and buying new trucks only for expansion. 760614. The Economics of Better Fuel Economy for Owner-Operators. H. E. Seiff, U.S. Dept. of Transportation. The owner-operator, like all motor carriers, is caught in a financial squeeze in this era of rising prices. By careful driving, modification of vehicles in use and spec'ing of new vehicles he can cut down on his fuel costs without cutting down on his quality of service and at the same time he can help conserve the nation's dwindling petro- leum resources. But uninformed actions can be counter- productive. Some of the simpler methods of cutting fuel consumption are discussed. In addition, logical guidelines for decision-making on the use of various concepts and devices and standardized test procedures, being developed by the SAE, are discussed. 760615. Suggested Changes in Current Noise Certifica- tion Procedures for Commercial Transport Air- craft. E. B. Fish, Jr. and N. L. Haight, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Cor- poration. The FAR Part 36 Noise Certification of subsonic turbojet-powered airplanes is reviewed. As more airplanes have been tested under FAR Part 36, the FAA has implemented several amendments to the rule and has established policies that interpret sections of the rule and add new constraints to demonstration procedures. In some cases, the policies have resulted in considerable economic burden without commensurate benefits for the airport neighbor. Based on the experience acquired at Douglas in DC-9 and DC- 10 noise certification programs, and on the results of aircraft noise research conducted within and outside the Company, several opportunities have been identified for controlling certification costs without compromise of national noise abatement objectives. These opportunities involve expansion of the allowable temperature-humidity test window, expanded use of acoustical analysis rather than flight testing, and simplification in the determination of maximum sideline noise levels. Recommendations are presented for appropriate action needed to develop and implement improved procedural requirements. 760617. Aircraft Noise Certification Procedures in Ret- rospect; 1969-1976. V. E. Callaway and N. A. Peart, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. Procedures for measurement and evaluation of aircraft noise are contained in FAR Part 36 which was formulated in the late sixties. Over six years experience with this regulation has resulted in more than 5000 noise certi- fication actions on the Boeing family of commercial jet transports. This experience has identified several potential areas for improvement of the regulation. Recommenda- tions are presented for modifications to those portions dealing with noise demonstration procedures and test limitations. It is believed these modifications will make complying with the regulation less complex, while im- proving the technical validity of measured noise levels. 760618. Aircraft Noise Standards A Government Point of View. Charles R. Foster, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administra- tion, Washington, D.C. The Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Part 36 was issued in 1969 to improve noise source control through better aircraft acoustic design. These standards and the government's implementation of them are reviewed as well as the necessity of attaining regulatory consistency on an international scale. Possible benefits that could be realized if FAR, Part 36 were revised are also projected. 760619. Survey of Truck Electrical Cranking Systems. Karl Groves, Leece Neville Div., Sheller Globe Corp. This paper reviews torque and speed capabilities of 12 and 24 volt cranking motors for heavy duty trucks. Advan- tages of 24 volt cranking are brought out, with a description of dual voltage switching or transformer/rec- tifier systems that are necessary. Effect of diesel crankcase lubricating oil grade on cold cranking is emphasized. Importance of the new "Main- tenance Free" batteries on cranking motor performance is shown. Improvements in 12 volt cranking motor per- formance are projected. 760620. A Designer's Guide for Heavy Duty Truck Wiring Harnesses. Allen Coombs, William Lippert, Larry Lowden, David Michaels, Charles J. Owen and Tom Thomas, Whitaker Cable Corp. On January 10th, 1972, an S.A.E. Paper "Lighting System Performance and the Computer as a Maintenance Tool" (720087) was presented by Charles J. Owen. This was a paper presented on the causes, effects, corrections and a 92</page><page sequence="80">760621 - 760638 study in good and bad electrical wiring, presented pictorially as well as editorially. We recommend that paper to you for reading. On November 4th, 1974, S.A.E. Paper "A Case for Standardization" (741143) was presented by Charles J. Owen. The purpose of this paper was intent on "im- proving the breed". The recommendations and specifi- cations were very specific. In view of the two previous papers, this paper is presented specifically for the designer with back-up data involving recommendations that the industry have gen- erally accepted as applied to the electrical wiring systems. The practical data included, is a first in relating indexes of performance and indexes to cost comparisons. The usefulness of this paper in aiding a Designer is the target of the authors. 1976 SAE Transactions 760621. Suggested SAE Standard for Identifying Auto- motive Wiring Circuits. W. S. Pape, International Harvester Co. Methods of identifying electrical circuits in the motor vehicle industry have become frustrating and time- consuming with today's complex designs. Skilled me- chanics of one motor vehicle manufacturer are faced with a complete change in circuit identification when servicing vehicles of another manufacturer. Since no industry-wide standard exists, the public is usually forced to seek servicing of electrical problems directly from the manu- facturer. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new simplified approach to motor vehicle electrical wiring circuit identification which could become an automotive industry standard. 760623. Bus Transit. James T. Pott, Transportation Agency, County of Santa Clara, California. Consideration of buses is as inevitable in any discussion of public transportation as consideration of automobiles in any discussion of overall mobility. Provision of bus transit, as a part of the functional hierarchy of trans- portation services, is addressed in terms of deployment strategy and bus technology lessons which have affected and will continue to affect bus transit programs in Santa Clara County. Traditional transit techniques need re- evaluation in the light of enlarged and synergistic public service goals now impinging on transit activities. Bus transit services alone are probably not satisfactory to respond to overall mobility goals of large urban com- munities. 760625. Golden Gate Coordinated System - Commuting By Land and By Sea. S. M. Kowleski, Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation Dis- trict. This paper describes the growing automobile congestion within the Golden Gate Corridor and reviews an alter- native means of public transportation through the use of buses and ferries. The paper outlines the planning and design criteria used in the selection of an optimum vessel and related terminal facilities. Three new Spaulding Class 165 foot, 750 passenger, vessels are presently under construction. These vessels will be all aluminum with a 25 knot power package consisting of gas turbine engines and waterjet pumps. Two modern marine passenger terminals have also been designed, with construction of one already completed. 760631. Engine Coolant Performance in Late Model Passenger Cars. Norman E. Payerle, Tarry town Technical Center, Union Carbide Corp. A national survey of factory-fill coolants in 1972 to 1974 vehicles has shown that moderate or heavy rusty sediment was present in 23% of these coolants the first year and 36% the third year. Corrosion inhibitor depletion and dilution have additionally contributed to result in a minimum of 35 to 53% of cars requiring cooling system service, increasing over these three years. This survey, showing good agreement with extensive data reported before SAE in 1966, indicates that the cooling system still should be serviced, including flushing and refilling with fresh antifreeze-coolant at minimum 50% concentration, each year for best assurance of continuous, satisfactory cooling system performance in modern engines. 760632. General Motors 200-THM Transmission. R. E. Annis, Hydra-Matic Div., General Motors Corp. A new light weight three-speed automatic transmission is being produced by General Motors Corporation. The unique features of this transmission are wide ratio gearing, a new mechanical throttle pressure system that protects against damage due to a disconnected operating cable, a new simple and more reliable governor mechanism, and a drive train in which all parts except the gears and shafts are made from sheet metal stampings joined together by welding. 760637. Designing the Brake System-Step by Step. Fred W. Cords and John B. Dale, Minnesota Au- tomotive, Inc. This paper will discuss the fundamentals of brake system design as they relate to industrial, agricultural and off-highway vehicles; providing a guide for the designer who finds himself with this engineering responsibility. However, it is also well to be aware that brake systems and system performance have come under surveillance and regulation in the last few years by International, Federal, State, Provincial and local Governments and their agencies, and that the designer consider this along with the data we are to discuss in this paper. 760638. Power Brake Valve With Inherent Manual Over- ride. Kenneth L. Williams and Peter Wolf, Auto Specialties Mfg. Co. The Ausco Power Brake Valve has been developed to provide smooth, well modulated braking for low or 93</page><page sequence="81">760639-760645 medium pressure, open or closed center hydraulic systems. It provides power and manual mode functions. In the power mode, pedal effort yields a proportional brake line pressure which gives a definite "feel" to the pedal. The manual mode provides continuous braking in case of hydraulic system failure. Other features possible include, 1) self-equalizing directional control, 2) two-stage manual override, and 3) integrated flow controls for power beyond capabilities. 760639. Caliper Disc Brakes Tow Vehicle/Trailer Com- bination Systems Evaluation. John A. Vanan- rooy, Auto Specialties Mfg. Co. Trailer braking requirements are rapidly changing due to new vehicle design concepts and Federal, State and International Regulations and Standards enacted and being proposed. Also, SAE and Industry Standards and Procedures, present and proposed, are concentrating more on trailer braking requirements. This paper discusses in general the design evaluation and types of control systems for use with Hydraulic Caliper Disc Brakes. These systems properly applied to the various kinds of trailers listed will aid in meeting individual, and combined vehicle requirements. 760640. Finite Element Analysis of a Carrier Frame. Thomas E. McHugh, Harnischfeger Corp.; and Vern D. Overbye, A. O. Smith Corp. In the past, the analysis of large, complicated steel frames has been extremely difficult, if not impossible. With the development of the computer and finite element analysis, the designer now has a tool to analyze the frame in detail and determine the potential areas of high stress before fabrication. This paper describes such a finite element model of the carrier frame of a rubber-tired mobile crane and how its analysis compares with actual test results. 760641. "Buckling" Failure Assessment for Long Cyl- inders. John T. Parrett, Benton Harbor Engi- neering Div., Koehring Co.; and S. K. R. Iyengar, Fluid Power Research Center, Okla- homa State University. A new method for the structural study of long hydraulic cylinders has been developed. The rational analysis, taking cognizance of most known conditions and dis- turbances, is capable of an iterative type solution by computer. Some examples of its use are given, illustrating the effects of stroke length and mounting position on stresses, deflections, internal bearing loads, and critical axial load. 1976 SAE Transactions 760642. Yanmar Diesel's Rotary Engine Chain Saw. Kojiro Yamaoka, Kenichi Kitaga wa, Yoshitsugu Hamada, Teruo Morimoto and Ryoichi Yama- nouchi, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. (Ja- pan). A new chain saw powered by rotary engine has been developed with a view to prevent the current injuries due to vibration from chain saws. This paper covers the construction of the rotary engine and performances of the new chain saw including vibration measurements. Vibration acceleration of the new chain saw shows so low level compared with reciprocating engine saws that it would be quite promising for prevention of the vibration injuries. 760643. The OMC 200 Hp V-6 Outboard Motor. Charles B. Hall and James S. Nerstrom, Outboard Marine Corp. This paper summarizes the objectives and choices for various design alternatives in making a 200 horsepower production outboard motor. The discussion covers the choice of cylinder arrangement, selection of scavenging process, intake system, exhaust tuning system and cooling system operation. Other areas covered include hydro- dynamic considerations for gearcase design, development of a new isolation system, a new hydraulic trim and tilt system, general structural requirements and considera- tions for corrosion protection. 760644. The Unsteady Gas Exchange Characteristics of a Two-Cycle Engine. G. P. Blair and M. C. Ashe, Mechanical Engineering Dept., (Northern Ireland). The theoretical modelling of the scavenge process for a naturally aspirated two-cycle engine is described and employed in conjunction with an unsteady gas dynamic analysis of flow in the engine ducting. Programmed for a digital computer, the results of this theoretical study are shown in relation to a 250 cm3 engine with values of predicted charging efficiency, scavenging efficiency, and delivery ratio given as a function of engine speed. These are compared with measured values of scavenging effi- ciency and the usual performance characteristics of power, mean effective pressure, delivery ratio, and specific fuel consumption. Also compared are the measured and predicted pressure diagrams taken in the cylinder, the crankcase, and the exhaust and inlet ducts. The design of a somewhat unique cylinder gas sampling valve of the mechanical type is described and its usage discussed both theoretically and practically. 1976 SAE Transactions 760645. Prediction of Two-Cycle Engine Performance Characteristics. G. P. Blair, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Dept., (Northern Ireland). Previous papers published by the author have described unsteady gas flow through a naturally aspirated two-cycle engine and the most recent of these publications details a theoretical modelling of the gas exchange or scavenge process for the cylinder of this type of power unit. This results in the ability to predict the trapped charge state, mass, and purity characteristics. With such information it becomes sensible to apply a closed cycle thermodynamic 94</page><page sequence="82">760646 - 760652 analysis to it and to further predict directly power, torque, and fuel consumption characteristics. This paper describes such a simple closed cycle analysis and compares the theoretical results of power, mean effective pressure, specific fuel consumption, and cylinder pressure diagrams with corresponding measured data from two engines. 1976 SA E Transactions 760646. Electrodeposited Coatings of Cylinder Bores for Small Aluminum Engines. Stanley Jacoby, Su- perior Tibon Plating Co. The type of surface that is used in the cylinder bore of a small aluminum engine is a critical item. This paper describes all the techniques presently used: the iron liner, the chrome plated cylinder, the nickel- silicon carbide composites, the Reynolds 390 aluminum alloy, and aluminum cylinders with chrome plated pistons. The emphasis is on the electrodeposits used in cylinder bores. 760647. 1500 Hp Diesel Electric Tractor. Bryant Trenary, Vehicle Constructors Div., Marion Power Shovel Co., Inc. The experience accumulated with a prototype 1000 HP diesel electric tractor since 1969 is described. The new 1500 HP V220 diesel electric tractors are described along with some of the initial operation of these two units. Experience with the initial 1000 HP unit and the two 1500 HP tractors confirm the necessity of additional testing and experimentation to refine the design to get greater productivity with reduced operator fatigue. The unpre- dictability of the load and operating surface are major problems that present a real challenge to the engineer. 760648. The Caterpillar 988B Wheel Loader. Stanley B. Adams, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new Caterpillar Wheel Loader has been developed as a replacement for the current production 988. This paper provides a review of the machine objectives, summarizes the development program, and provides an introduction to the major features. 760649. A Stability Indicator for Front-End Loaders. Irmin O. Kamm and Gilbert A. Wray, Stevens Institute of Technology; and James C. Ault, U.S. Bureau of Mines. This paper presents a progress report of our study of the front-end loader (FEL) roll-over instability problem and the development status of a stability indicator used to improve the safety of front-end loader operations. As this paper is being written the program is still active and progress is continuing. The contributing factors have been identified, the loader stability characteristics have been determined and several overturn warning indicators are being fabricated for installation for subsequent field evaluation. The indicator is sensitive to bucket load and position, pitch and roll angle, articulation angle and vehicle speed. The above signals are used as inputs to analog circuits which solve a correlation equation and compare the actual roll angle to the "critical" roll angle. The device displays a visual warning to the operator. 1976 SA E Transactions 760650. Draft Power Optimization for Improved Bull- dozing Production. Robert N. Hambright, South- west Research Institute; and John M. Goris, Spokane Mining Research Center, U.S. Bureau of Mines. A method of improving bulldozing production has been developed which allows the tractor operator to con- tinuously optimize the effective work done by the bull- dozer. The system contains sensors to measure both the effective draft force and true ground speed of the tractor. The electronic system is designed to multiply the two measurements to yield the draft power product (force X speed). Dozer production can be maximized if the operator controls the blade to continuously obtain the highest values of draft power. Field evaluations of the draft power system consisting of 42 separate tests, indicated that dozer production can be increased by 10-20% by optimizing the draft power meter indication observed by the operator. The field testing program also showed that a reliable production prototype of the draft power system could be developed from the laboratory prototype tested. Currently, field testing of revised components is underway at an active coal mining operation in Texas. These tests will provide realistic assessment of the benefits of the system in reclamation of surface-mined lands. 760651. Diesel Powered Underground Mining Equipment. Donald L. Countryman, Wagner Mining Equip- ment Co. The purpose of this paper is to describe the challenges and limitations involved in the design and manufacture of rubber tired, diesel powered, underground mining equip- ment, particularly in the areas where they differ from surface equipment. It will also outline and describe the environment and usage of this equipment underground in both metallic (hardrock) and non-metallic (coal) mines.

Tires and Tracks in Agriculture. W. W. Brixius, Deere &amp; Company, Moline, Illinois; and F. M. Zoz, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Waterloo, Iowa. The question of the use of tires and tracks on agricultural prime movers is again surfacing. The four-wheel drive market is growing fast, particularly in areas where crawlers have been popular. The relative performance characteristics of tires and tracks are compared in agricultural soil conditions. Compaction characteristics are studied and an overall cost/benefit analysis is made supporting the trend to four-wheeled drive tractors in the agricultural market. 1976 SA E Transactions 760654. Performance of a Passive Grouser-Track System. R. N. Yong, E. A. Fattah and A. Youssef, Soil Mechanics Research Laboratory, McGill Uni- versity (Canada). In this paper, the performance of a passive grouser- track system is shown - both in the field and in laboratory confirmation trials. The field testing of vehicles, done in conjunction with Bombardier Ltd. to evaluate perform- ance is described. The passive design features of the grousers used are meant to specifically reduce aggressive surface entry and drag. In field trials, requirements for performance include development of drawbar pull of at least three quarters of the maximum available in standard grouser-track systems in snow covered terrain and general soft soil conditions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760655. Proportional Braking for Large Trucks in Moun- tain Mine Service-Some Aspects of Design. G. Walker and A. G. Doige, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering of Calgary (Canada). Large rear end dump trucks are used for downhaul operations in mountain mines. On these trucks mechan- ical service brakes are provided on both front and rear wheel sets. They may be either disc or drum brakes actuated by a hydraulic/pneumatic system. On some trucks provision is made for the brake effort on the front wheel sets to be reduced at the discretion of the driver. This proportional braking is intended to minimise the possibility of front wheel skidding on icy roads with consequent loss of steering. However, this voluntary reduction in front wheel braking seriously impairs the braking capacity of the truck. A study was made of the braking requirements of heavy vehicles on inclined surfaces. It was found for typical loaded truck geometries in present use that the rear wheels will always slip first. Therefore, with present front and rear brake proportions any reduction in front wheel braking appears unjustified if the objective is to eliminate the possibility of front wheel slip before the rear wheel starts to slip. Design charts are included for critical slip conditions for road grades up to 20 percent for different road/tire interface coefficients of friction for a range of vehicle deceleration rates. 1976 SA E Transactions 760656. Increased Productivity of Off-Road Vehicles Through Lighter Working Tools. Lee E. Tucker, Materials Research, Deere &amp; Company, Moline, Illinois; and James K. Dunn, Test &amp; Evaluation, John Deere Dubuque Works, Dubuque, Iowa. Productivity of construction equipment can be increased by reducing weight of the working tools such as a loader or backhoe. Less weight means more pay load and lower inertial load. Efficient design with high-strength micro- alloyed steels offers the designers an opportunity to reach this goal. In applying these steels, the specific service requirements are considered along with material prop- erties and the effects of manufacturing processes such as forming or welding. These factors are incorporated into the design process to insure an increase in productivity through efficient component design. The process of incorporating new more efficient material in the structural design is discussed. 760657. Application of Nil Ductility Temperature and Charpy V-Notch Testing to Design and Quality Control of High Strength, Low Alloy Steel. M. E. Suess and T. L. Proft, Koehring Co. The importance of notch toughness is gaining rapid recognition by the construction equipment industry. The traditional Charpy V-Notch Test is not directly applicable to design, but nil ductility temperature (NDT) can be used to predict the onset of brittle fracture given the temper- ature, local and average stress, and approximate initial crack length. This investigation shows that while Charpy V-Notch energy cannot be used to accurately predict NDT for ASTM A572 - Grade 50 steels, the CVN test may be useful for screening purposes. The spread of NDT in production material was found to be 110°F. 1976 SA E Transactions 760659. Parameters Affecting the Damping Produced by a Septum-Loaded Fibrous Blanket. Thomas W. Kozyra, H. L. Blachford, Inc. A variety of parameters affecting the damping perform- ance of a septum-loaded fibrous blanket were examined by extending the scope of the widely used "Geiger Thick Plate Test Method." Damping performance of a septum-loaded fibrous blanket system is influenced by the septum mass, the spacer layer material, and the manner in which the system is adhered. Increasing the septum mass improves the damping performance. By proper selection of the spacer layer and adhesion of the system, damping performance can be enhanced. 1976 SA E Transactions 760660. The Gator Soil Stabilizer. Robert H. McClaran, RayGo, Inc. 96</page><page sequence="84">760661 - 760668 Stabilization is the process of improving undesirable characteristics or conditions of soils and aggregates to the degree where they can be used as a base or pavement structure in the construction of streets, highways, airports, dams, etc., by the introduction of additives into the soil. With the scarcity and high cost of aggregate, the need for a mobile, in place, mixing machine developed. This led to the design of the RayGo Gator soil stabilizer. This paper will discuss the design features and application of this machine. 760661. The Integral Grade Trimmer/ Concrete Slipform Paver-Its Concept and Development. G. L. Godbersen and Robert Whitney, GOMACO Corp. A new concept in hydraulic powered subgrade trimmer design has been developed which shows promise of increasing concrete slipform paving accuracy and pro- duction as it relates to concrete curb and gutter, sidewalk, monolithic curb, gutter, and sidewalk, and median barrier wall construction. This trimmer, when incorporated as an integral part of an automated slipform paver/prime mover, efficiently cuts rough grade to a tolerance of plus or minus 1/8 in. in 10 ft (.32 cm in 3.05 m), while the paver portion forms freestanding concrete in the same opera- tion. This trimmer/paver design promises to reduce what was previously a two machine or two pass trimming, then paving operation, to a one machine - one pass operation. 760662. Thin-Lift Recycling of Asphalt Pavement. Joseph J. Winderlin, Cutler Repaving, Inc. Five basic steps of efficient and economical continuous thin-lift asphalt pavement recycling are listed and the design features of the Cutler Repaver are described.

Some guidelines are provided to allow general use of the data given in the literature. 1976 SAE Transactions 760664. Wet Friction Material-Some Modes of Failure and Methods of Correction. Robert L. Fish, R/M Friction Materials Co. This paper presents results of an SAE #2 Machine study of several factors influencing wet friction material oper- ation. By adjusting test condition, it is shown how plate deflection, spacer roughness, power loading, energy loading, etc. can produce mechanical and/or thermal distress of the friction material. In comparative testing, it is also shown how these problems can be reduced or eliminated by proper selection of friction material, groove, assembly and spacer plate geometries, oil type and flow, etc. The purpose of this work is to contribute to understanding of wet friction couples to permit identi- fication of the mode of failure (1) to provide corrective action in present designs and (2) to optimize future design. 1976 SAE Transactions 760665. Effect of Bainite in the Outer Carburized Case on Rolling Contact Fatigue Life. Joseph S. Learman, Federal-Mogul Corp.; and George T. Eldis, Climax Molybdenum Co. This paper presents the results of a joint research project by Federal-Mogul Corporation and Climax Molybdenum Company of Michigan to determine the effect that the presence of bainite in the outer carburized case has on rolling contact fatigue life. Rolling contact fatigue specimens (0.375-in. diameter bars) of AISI 4118 steel that had been carburized and then quenched at different rates to produce varying amounts of bainite in the outer case were used for this study. After fatigue testing, these specimens were sectioned and metallographically examined to determine the volume fraction of bainite present in the outer case for each test track. The hardness for each test track was also measured. This data along with the fatigue data was then analyzed statistically using the Weibull method to determine the effects of bainite in the carburized case on the rolling contact fatigue life. 760666. Low Maintenance Nomex/Teflon Fabric Com- posite Bearings. Richard J. Matt and Richard T. Thompson, Fafnir Bearing Div., Textron, Inc.

Assessment of Occupational Noise Exposure and Associated Hearing Damage Risk for Agricultural Employees. John D. Harris, Bent J. Lindgren and Roy L. Mann, J. I. Case Co. This paper describes background information, measure- ment procedures, data analysis techniques, and results pertaining to assessment of agricultural employee occu- pational noise exposure. The criteria on which the proposed OSHA 85 dB(A) 16 hour general industry noise regulation is based has been applied to predict hearing damage risk. Analysis of 237 man days of measured noise exposures shows that annual occupational noise exposure must be established to assess hearing damage risk. No evidence was found that agricultural employees are exposed to noise levels/durations which exceed the criteria for annual and lifetime noise exposure on which the proposed OSHA general industry regulation is based. 1976 SA E Transactions 760674. Federal Regulation of Noise in Agricultural and Off-Highway Equipment. Dr. Floyd A. Van Atta, Quinnipiac College.

Testing and Design Application Procedures for Hydraulic Hose Assemblies. H. D. Berns, Deere &amp; Company. The expanding use of hydraulic components in off- highway machines has increased the need to be able to properly select these components to insure adequate service life when used as a part of a complete machine. This paper shows how a design engineer can match expected component service loads with the capability of hydraulic hose assemblies as determined by durability type tests in the laboratory. The paper shows how existing SAE impulse type tests can be used to generate "Pres- sure-Life Curves". The selection of a hydraulic hose based on "Pressure-Life Curves" and the expected service history is illustrated. 760685. Design and Test of a 6000 PSI Hydraulic Tube Fitting Developed to Meet the High Pressure Trend in Off-Highway Equipment. L. B. O'Sickey, Parker Hannifin Corp. This paper discusses the trend toward pressure hydraulic systems in off-highway vehicles and relates that trend to current user requirements ie: components, safety, and reliability information. The development of a high pressure, 6000 psi fitting, and the importance of testing during development stages of these high pressure com- ponents is emphasized using a specific design as an example. Testing and test planning are discussed. A set of nine qualifying tests is reviewed and plans for a four-way analysis of variance projected. 760686. Variable Displacement Pump and Controls- Applied to Variable Speed-Variable Torque Drive Systems. L. M. Claar, Mobile Hydraulic Div., Parker Hannifin Corp. A design analysis is described that leads to optimizing the power efficiency of a hydraulic system. This analysis is concerned with matching a variable displacement hy- draulic pump and its control mechanisms to its power source to derive maximum utilization of hydraulic energy in both open and closed loop control systems. The analysis is concerned with variable speed, variable torque drives typically found in material handling and light industrial applications. This design analysis is well suited for those appli- cations where horsepower conservation, increased ma- chine productivity, and desired improvements in a control of hydraulic functions are desirable objectives. 760687. Electrohydraulic Control of Hydrostatic Trans- missions. T. P. Neal, Controls Div., Moog Inc. Hydrostatic Transmissions have gained widespread ac- ceptance on mobile equipment over the last decade. They offer an efficient means to transmit energy at high power 99</page><page sequence="87">760689 - 760697 Ievels, while maintaining smooth proportional control. In the last few years, electrohydraulic devices have become available for stroking pump and motor swashplates with small electrical signals. This capability creates almost unlimited possibilities for improved control of mobile vehicles, ranging from simple remote control of the pump swashplate to sophisticated automatic control. This paper discusses the more practical types, including steering, crossover control (pump/motor phasing), engine anti-stall control, pressure override, and constant-speed control. 760689. Testing ROPS and FOPS for Safety Compliance. Ronald D. Wetjen, John Deere Dubuque Works. Simplified testing procedures which fulfill the loading requirements of SAE Roll Over Protective Structure (ROPS) Code J 1040a have been developed. Also, a tubular fixture was devised which accurately directs the drop object toward the overhead guard as required by Falling Object Protective Structure (FOPS) Code J231. 760690. An Analytical Procedure for the Support of ROPS Design. Rudolph E. Yeh, Yuan Huang and Edward L. Johnson, International Harvester Co. An analytical procedure has been developed to fulfill the need for a technical support of the design of well balanced ROPS. The procedure is incorporated in a computer program referred to as SAPROPS by its acronym. SAPROPS performs elastic-plastic, non-linear analyses of space frames by the direct stiffness method. Examples are given to demonstrate effective appli- cations of the program to the design of ROPS for agricultural and earth-moving vehicles. Good correlations between the computed results and the experimental data are shown. A possible enhancement of the analytical procedure is also discussed. 760691.

Input for the analysis includes tractor dimensions, surface conditions, force-deflection characteristics of the tractor's rollover protective structure, soil properties, initial tractor position, initial tractor velocity, tractor mass, and tractor mass moment of inertia. Results of the analysis are used to study the effect of tractor mass on the force and energy absorbed by the tractor's rollover protective structure. 1976 SAE Transactions 760693. A Finite Element Analysis Post-Processor to Provide Simplified Design Data for Fabricated Plate Structures. G. A. Ross and C. M. Bost, Jr., Tractor Operations, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes a post-processing procedure which allows finite element static stress analysis to be integrated efficiently into the early design stages of welded plate structures. Systematic application of conventional deri- vations is used to consider the types of loading in each plate member and in each welded joint, and also to evaluate stress reversals caused by a sequence of loading conditions. The procedure interprets the finite element output and presents pertinent information through stress vector plots and various summary reports, so that the designer may achieve an understanding of the overall load carrying behavior of the structure. 1976 SAE Transactions 760694. Finite Element Analysis of Welded Structures. G. W. Krutz and L. J. Segerlind, Agricultural Engineering Dept., Michigan State University. The object of this work was to predict the thermo-history of a welded joint using finite element analysis and provide design engineers with a reliable method of optimizing weld joint strength. A computer model was constructed and results indicate the cooling of metal adjacent to the weld pool is the critical metallurgical location. Variables affecting this cooling time include metallurgical constituents, radius of the heat flux, velocity of the arc, thermal conductivity of molten steel. The model includes thermal conductivity and specific heat as functions of temperature, latent heat of fusion, radiation, convection and a gauss distributed heat flux. 760695.

It also includes considerations of conditions most often overlooked in applying hydrostatic drives. 760699. Basic Service Requirements for Hydrostatic Transmissions in Mobile Industrial Equipment. V. A. Nelson, J. L. Love and A. E. Nordby, Pay Line Div., International Harvester Co. In the hydrostatic concept, maintenance is an absolute must! There exists at any knowledge level countless texts, guides and etc., on service routine. There is, however, in the final analysis no substitute for the benefits to be derived by contributions that can be made by design and service engineering who have the opportunity of building a practical service routine into the end product. New products are never really destroyed from without, but from a lack of in-depth study in the art of service ability. 760702. Product Liability-Its Effect on The Manufac- turer-Distributor Relationship. Robert D. Tom- linson, Charles Machine Works, Inc. Product liability is becoming an increasingly important factor in the manufacture and distribution of products. For this reason, both the manufacturer and distributor should be aware of the legal concept of product liability and take steps to reduce the probability of injury from their products and protect the mutual interests of themselves and their customers in the event of product liability litigation. 760703.

The Handling Properties of Light Trucks. D. J. Bickerstaff, Ford Motor Company. The purpose of this paper is to discuss handling in the context of those operational variables and vehicle chassis considerations which are most significant in affecting the handling properties of light trucks. In discussing handling for normal driving the Corner- ing Compliance Concept is used to combine the most significant parameters in a simple lumped parameter model. Limit handling performance and the mechanics of rollover are discussed in the paper. It is observed that exposure to limit handling maneu- vers is unlikely to occur in normal driving. The signif- icance of vehicle handling properties to highway safety is an unknown at this time. 760711. Cornering Compliance Applied to Dynamics of Rolling Vehicles. Frederick J. Winsor, Chrysler Corp. Simplified mathematical models of the automobile are useful for analyzing the design of new vehicles and for studying the dynamics of driver/vehicle systems. For this study, the equations are linearized about straight-line motion, and an orthogonal axis system is employed. Root locus techniques are used to predict the effect of roll steer on transient behavior. Frequencies and decay rates for the transfer function polynomials are approximated by simple expressions involving cornering compliances. The results facilitate physical interpretation and include the influence of roll steer on dynamic behavior. 760712. The Static Directional Stability and Control of the Automobile. William F. Milliken, Milliken Research Associates, Inc., Fred Dell'Amico, Consulting Engineer; and Roy S. Rice, Calspan Corporation. An approach to the study of static stability and control of the automobile, that is based on a concept of tethered vehicle testing using a yaw constraint, is described. The supporting theory, however, stands alone as a method of analysis. Graphical methods are developed in which 101</page><page sequence="89">760713 -760718 sideforce, yaw moment, and lateral acceleration coor- dinates define performance plots. These plots reveal certain well-known steady-state performance parameters as well as a new one that defines static stability quantitatively. The theory is presented for the linear automobile with tire sideforce saturation but is applicable, by testing or computer simulation, to the non-linear case. 1976 SAE Transactions 760713. The Cornering Compliance Concept for Descrip- tion of Vehicle Directional Control Properties. R. T. Bundorf, General Motors Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp.; and R. L. Leffert, General Motors Proving Ground, General Mo- tors Corp. The automobile directional control system is not easily simplified and the description of its design or engineering properties has necessarily been complex. In this paper, a concept for combining most vehicle design parameters into two terms, front and rear cornering compliance, is proposed. Analysis and simulation results are presented to illustrate the correspondence between the front and rear cornering compliance parameters and vehicle steady state and transient responses. The results indicate that the cornering compliance approach is reasonably accurate, easily understood and complementary to existing directional control theory and conventions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760714. Joining Dissimilar Metals With Transition Ma- terials. Robert Baboian and Gardner Haynes, Texas Instruments Inc. Galvanic corrosion and mechanical properties are major design considerations for bimetallic assemblies. Galvanic corrosion can lead to rapid degradation while welding of dissimilar metals such as steel and aluminum can lead to reduced structural stability. This paper describes a new concept in joining dissimilar metals involving the use of transition materials. The clad transition materials is composed of the dissimilar metals to be joined and effectively reduces the corrosion and mechanical prob- lems associated with the system. Results of galvanic corrosion field tests and welding studies for transition materials are presented and several examples of auto- motive applications are cited. 760715. A Family of Thermomechanically Treated High Strength Sheet Steels. Donald J. Bailey, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. A family of thermomechanically treated (TMT) low carbon steels, with strengths of 400 to 600 M Pa, is proposed as an alternative to the high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels being used to reduce the thickness, and thus weight, of selected automotive stampings. The micro- structure consists of randomly dispersed martensite in a strain-aged ferrite matrix. Prior to stamping, the steels are of intermediate strength and microstructurally stable. After stamping, they age rapidly at both ambient and elevated temperatures to attain their final strength. Press formability, fatigue resistance, low temperature impact, and corrosion resistance are at least comparable to HSLA steels. 1976 SA E Transactions 760716. Residual Stress and Fatigue Strength of Car- burized and Quenched Steel. Moritaro Moto- yama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The fatigue limits of carburized (case depth 0.2 mm through 0.8 mm) and quenched SCr22 (similar to SAE 5120) specimens and their relationship to variations of residual stress distributions for 0.3 mm, 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm case depth SCr22 specimens were determined through the application of three levels of repeated stress: those of equal to, higher than or less than the fatigue limit. It was shown that if the compressive residual stress in the outer layer of the specimen is sufficiently reserved during repeated stress, residual stress contributes to a higher fatigue limit, although its distribution changes. 1976 SAE Transactions 760717.

A high-output Army two-cycle diesel engine was subjected to proving-ground related laboratory-dynamometer en- durance test cycles using four different qualified MIL- L-2104C SAE grade 30 lubricants. Three diesel fuels differing mainly in sulfur level and end point temperature were an important part of the test matrix. Two lubricants (low- and mid-ash level) produced acceptable perform- ance and a third (of high-ash level) was considered borderline acceptable-all during operation with reference No. 2 diesel fuel (0.42% wt sulfur). A fourth oil (low-ash level) was judged to be incompatible due to its proneness to severe piston and liner scuffing. The engine was judged incompatible with a high sulfur/high end-point [1.2%S/396°C (744 °F) EP] fuel intended to meet MIL- F-16884F (Marine Diesel Fuel) using two different MIL-L-2104C lubricants. This engine was also judged to be incompatible with a special blend of NATO F-54 diesel fuel (0.64% sulfur) during operation with the same two lubricants. Incompatibility using fuel sulfur levels greater than 0.50% was based on the occurrence of catastrophic piston/ring/exhaust valve failure and relatively high deposit and wear levels. 760718. Upgrading of the Mack Diesel Engine Lubricant Specifications. W. R. Alexander and L. T. Murphy, Mack Trucks, Inc. Field experience, together with engine laboratory testing, indicated the need for upgrading of Mack's diesel engine 102</page><page sequence="90">760719 -760725 lubricant specifications. Field testing and laboratory testing indicated the superiority of several of the newer oil formulations for the Mack engine requirements. The newer type multi-viscosity oils were found to be partic- ularly suited. A modified multi-cylinder engine test (T-5) was developed together with an oil specification based on the use of this test procedure (EO-J). 760719. Field Experience of Extended Drain Interval in Diesel Lubricant Performance. E. F. Boone and F. E. Didot, Šuntech, Inc. Four engine oils were field tested in three different types of truck diesel engines using 100,000 mile drain intervals. Periodic oil samples from each test vehicle were analyzed. After 100,000 miles engines were dismantled, inspected and rated. Results of this test work indicate that drain intervals much longer than currently recommended are possible with current engine and oil technology. Also, filter change intervals can also be extended from current practice. Included in this paper are analytical data from the used oil samples and engine inspection reports for the four oil formulations tested. 760720. Trends in Japanese Diesel Engines and Their Lubrication. Kiyoshi Sakamoto, Nippon Oil Co. In Japan there is a large and growing number of diesel engines used in commercial vehicles and construction equipment. This paper reports the recent Japanese trends related to these automotive diesel engines and diesel engine oils. In addition, Japanese diesel engine emission regulations are discussed as well as the relation between lubricant performance and emissions. Promising methods for controlling emissions and future trends in lubricant quality are also discussed. 760721. Lubrication Requirements of European Automo- tive Diesel Engines. C. R. Knight, Perkins Engines Co.; and H. Weiser, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd. A survey of production statistics, design types and application of high speed automotive diesel engines (rated speed &gt; 1800 rpm) in Western Europe has been conducted, together with a forecast in market trends. Lubrication problems of these engines have been under review by the CEC Investigation Group IGL-5, high- lighting lubricant related problem areas such as bore polishing, valve train wear, oil thickening, and ring sticking. These problems have been analysed within the IGL-5 Group and the suitability of existing standardised test methods for present and anticipated European needs has been reviewed. This has shown the necessity to develop specific test methods covering bore polishing and valve train wear. Further examination in the other problem areas identified has been initiated. 760722. Cylinder Bore Polishing in Automotive Diesel Engines - A Progress Report on a European Study. J. V. D. Wilson, Edwin Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd.; and J. R. B. Calow, Shell Research, Ltd. Cylinder bore polishing as evidenced by areas of bright mirror finish, can lead to excessive oil consumption, ring and bore scuffing and seizure. It has become a problem of significant concern to manufacturers of high speed diesel engines and tests have shown that choice of lubricant can influence its occurrence. Te§t results are reported from multi-cylinder production engines and from single cyl- inder laboratory engines, and progress has been made towards the establishment of a suitable lubricant per- formance evaluation test method. 760723. Lubricating Oil Contamination in Indirect Injec- tion Diesel Engines. I. B. Smith and A. R. Chowings, Research and Product Development Div., Perkins Engines, Ltd. The paper briefly discusses the reasons behind the resurgence of interest in indirect injection diesel engines. It takes as its main theme the problem of lubricating oil contamination by combustion products, which is a feature peculiar to indirect injection engines. This problem can lead to severe oil thickening and eventual lubrication failure. A work programme has defined how the rates of contamination vary with different design parameters and various engine running conditions. Substantial improvements are predicted by close attention to combustion chamber design and piston and ring behaviour. The Authors take the realistic approach that the soot contamination will never be completely eliminated at source and hence means of filtering out the contaminant (which are sub-micron sized particles) are discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760724. A Turbocharged Diesel Engine Test for Evalu- ating Ring Sticking Tendencies of High Quality Diesel Engine Oils. C. H. Knight, Lubrizol International Laboratories. The use of a European 5945 cc (363 cubic inch dis- placement, CID) engine and 300 hour test procedure is evaluated as a means of predicting the ring sticking tendencies of crank-case oils in turbocharged diesel engines. Correlative data are provided with the Caterpillar OL-1 Test. The 5945 cc engine test identifies the ring sticking tendencies of two oils in the same manner as the known field histories of these lubricants. Progress is reported on test development and re- finement. Test results show the superior ability of a selected oil formulation to minimize piston ring sticking tendencies. 760725. An Analysis of the Variables Associated With the Roller Shear Fatigue Test. William A. Ashe, BASF Wyandotte Corp. This paper describes an in-depth study of the roller shear fatigue tester as a useful apparatus for measuring fatigue 103</page><page sequence="91">760726-760736 properties of flexible urethane foams. Included in the study was the effect of foam thickness, foam density, and the number of flex cycles. 760726. Stress Cracking of Plastics by Gasoline. C. H. M. Jacques and M. G. Wyzgoski, General Motors Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. The susceptibility of polycarbonate, poly (methyl metha- crylate), and cellulose acetate butyrate to gasoline- induced stress cracking was evaluated by measuring the critical strains of specimens exposed to a variety of commercial gasolines and gasoline components. In gen- eral, the critical strain decreased and the severity of cracking of molded parts increased as the aromatic content of the gasolines increased. However, low molec- ular weight aliphatics as well as specific aromatic components did also markedly reduce critical strain. The effects of sample geometry, temperature, and weathering on critical strain were determined. The capability to predict the critical strain of polymers in the presence of complex liquid mixtures on the basis of physical constants of pure liquid components was examined. 1976 SA E Transactions 16KS121. Dynamic Response of Flexible Urethane Foam after Stress-Relaxation. William A. Ashe, BASF Wyandotte Corp. This paper describes the development of a mechanical test apparatus for measuring the dynamic response of flexible foams after extended stress relaxation. Additional items discussed are creep, pocketing and fight back. 1976 SA E Transactions 760728. Durability of Olefinic Thermoplastic Elastomers. S. A. Banks and J. H. Brillinger, Exxon Chem- ical Company, Elastomers Technology Division, Linden, New Jersey; and D. G. Perham, Exxon Chemical Company, U.S.A., Automotive De- velopment, Southfield, Michigan. Data is presented showing that thermoplastic elastomers have good weathering properties, are serviceable over a broad temperature range, and resist a wide selection of chemicals. A statistically designed experiment for a family of olefinic thermoelastics covering a wide range of pro- cessing, physical and mechanical properties is reported and results confirmed with compositions derived from the design predictor equations. All compositions within the design parameters pass selected critical automotive painting specifications sug- gesting that extensive and costly materials qualification procedures currently required for even minor changes can be streamlined considerably to facilitate their early commercial introduction to a particular application area. 760731. Ply Steer in Radial Carcass Tires. Marion G. Pottinger, B.F. Goodrich Research &amp; Devel- opment Center. The source of ply steer in radial carcass tires is out- of-plane bending to in-plane shear coupling in the tread band portion of the tire laminate. Laminate design controls the coupling and, therefore, controls ply steer. Design control is discussed and demonstrated through examples that eliminated ply steer. Aligning torque static phase is introduced. It con- ceptually simplifies vehicle pull problems. Ply steer in bias carcass tires is briefly discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760732. Influence of Tire Design Parameters on Tire Force and Moment Characteristics. D. J. Schur- ing, G. A. Tapia and I. Gusakov, Calspan Corporation. A comprehensive cornering and braking tire test program performed on 380 tires under uniform and strictly controlled conditions resulted in 13 performance char- acteristics measured at 4 to 6 different loads for each tire. All performance characteristics (more than 25,000) to- gether with tire design and construction information were organized in a computer program that would quickly extract, correlate, and display any data of interest. As examples of the capabilities of the program, the gross effects of wheel diameter, aspect ratio, cord and belt material, and tire construction on linear and non-linear tire cornering and braking characteristics are identified. 760734. Aramid: Tire Applications. D. M. Callahan, A. G. Causa and J. M. Gingo, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Since the introduction of cotton cords in tires, reinforcing materials have played a major role in tire technology advancement. Today specialty fibers with specific mate- rial properties are used to engineer tire products. The desired fiber properties for radial tire carcass, radial tire belt, and bias carcass tire are discussed. The application of the most recent tire fiber, aramid, and the resultant tire performance is presented. 760736. The Free Access Concept - A New Challenge to Human Factors. Leland W. Knight and R. Brooks Stover, Design Staff, General Motors Corp. The "free access concept" is a unique transportation system created in response to a growing number of physical environments, identified as pedestrian precincts, in which walking is the primary mode of transit, and which partially limit or completely preempt normal vehicular traffic. This concept is completely compatible with pedestrians and offers continuous operation with access to a moving vehicle at any point on the vehicle path, no standing in line at fixed stops, freedom from guideways and a detection system to prevent collisions with pedestrians or objects along the pathway. The fully automatic, battery-powered vehicles of the free access system are guided by a harmless buried signal wire. 104</page><page sequence="92">760737 - 760744 This paper presents the background and development of this transportation concept from the identification of the need through the design of a test vehicle and its first field evaluation in Battle Creek, Michigan. The central focus of this paper is the development and measurement of the qualitative aspects of the free access system in relation to human factors. 760737. Painted Elastomerics in Tomorrow's Automobile. George M. Wolf, Ford Motor Co. Painted and color-impregnated elastomerics are used on exterior body components. Flexible urethanes, micro- cellular and injection molded, ethylene propylene terpoly- mer, thermoplastic polyolefins, all painted matching or contrasting body colors, color impregnated or painted vinyl and color impregnated ethylene ethyl acrylate are being utilized for applications, such as bumpers, stone deflectors, front ends, rear quarter extensions and body side moldings. The initial incentive to employ color exterior elas- tomerics was to reduce damagability. In later years, government regulations, both state and national, dictated energy absorbing systems, and more recently the energy crisis, has prompted usage in some applications to reduce body weight. 760738. EPDM for Exterior Trim Applications. John L. Von Wald, E.I. duPont de Nemours and Com- pany, (Inc.), Elastomer Chemicals Department, Wilmington, Delaware. The purpose of this paper is to review the current status of EPDM from the standpoint of applicable properties, availability, custom molder capabilities and commercial implications. Current EPDM applications are described and, where appropriate, comparisons are made with reaction injection molded urethane (RIM) which, to date, has had the broadest usage in flexible fascia. In addition, anticipated developments in EPDM technology are described to give the automotive engineer and stylist an insight into possible EPDM capabilities in the future. 760739. Thermoplastic Elastomers for Flexible Body Components. J. H. Brillinger and S. A. Banks, Exxon Chemical Company, Elastomers Tech- nology Division, Linden, New Jersey 07036. Thermoplastic elastomers provide a balance of rubber-like properties with easy processing using standard plastics fabrication equipment. Selected physical properties of several types of thermoplastic elastomers are compared including stress-strain, and flexural modulus over a broad temperature range which shows the advantage of polyole- fin based systems. Results after one year South Florida exposure of both painted and unpainted materials dem- onstrates good weatherability. Typical fabrication con- ditions for both injection molding and extrusion are described. 1976 SA E Transactions 760740. The Development History of The Space Saver Spare. Stephen A. Molick, B.F. Goodrich Co. A review of the historical development of The B.F. Goodrich Space Saver Spare tire. The foldable tire concept was originated for aircraft applications and then later expanded for an emergency spare in the automotive industry. This paper includes a review of tire construction, molding techniques, safety valves, and the Consumer Education Program. 760741. Some Approaches to a Failure Proof Tire. R. H. Snyder, Tire Technology, Uniroyal Tire Co. Paper analyzes the flat tire problem and the conceptual approaches to the solution. One of these, the use of puncture sealants is discussed in detail with supporting data. The need for an adequate low pressure warning device is cited. 760742. A New Approach to Spare Tires - Mini-Spare. J. P. Lawrence, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A new spare tire has been developed which is smaller, thinner, and will thus occupy less vehicle trunk space. The mini-spare tire and wheel weighs 40% less which makes for easier application and also assists the vehicle designer in his quest for lighter cars. The mini-spare uses 60 PSI inflation to carry the vehicle load and produces cornering power substantially the same as standard sized tires. Other vehicle performance characteristics are satisfactory when comparing the mini-spare on any one vehicle position vs. the standard tire. Tire heat generation and overall weight are minimized by using a shallow skid, round tire profile. 760743. The DENOVO Run Flat Tire. D. H. James, Dunlop Ltd. (United Kingdom); and H. M. Keen, Dunlop Tire and Rubber Corp. Elimination of the automobile spare wheel and main- tenance of vehicle control/mobility during and after tyre deflation are important objectives. The DENOVO tyre/ wheel system with runflat capability offers a potential means of obtaining these goals. The system combines tyre/wheel geometric design; positive location of bead to rim; an internal lubricant system and special rubber compounding. Field experience over 2-1/2 years has confirmed its technical viability, establishing a minimum performance of 50 miles at 40 mph in the deflated mode. Work on weight and cost reduction is proceeding. 760744. Industrial Telemetry for Applications in the Automotive Industry. Edward L. Rossiter, Acurex Autodata Inc. The purpose of this paper will be twofold. The paper will initially describe the basic principals of industrial telemetry and the second part of the paper will discuss some applications within the automotive industry. Industrial telemetry is a technique used to transfer data from rotating and moving equipment where other methods of 105</page><page sequence="93">760745-760753 transmitting the data such as slip-rings or rotary trans- formers are not practical. The transmission of data is accomplished by a very small, rugged, and lightweight RF transmitter which can be conveniently installed in the rotating and moving equipment. The more common applications include torque and horsepower on drive shafts of all types and the meas- urement of stress and temperature on rotary components such as gear teeth and turbine blades. These measure- ments can be accomplished under a variety of conditions, not only in the laboratory, but in actual field testing. 760745. Radio Telemetry Applied to Tire Vibrations. William F. Reiter, Jr. and Allen C. Eberhardt, Center for Acoustical Studies, North Carolina State Univ. This paper discusses the industrial radio telemetry system for use in typical automotive engineering measurements. Considerations of transducer type and measurement class (static or dynamic) are discussed in terms of selection of a telemetry system. Telemetry specifications and their interpretations are discussed along with characteristics and limitations of direct/FM and AM/FM systems. As an example application the measurement of in-service tire vibrations with radio telemetry is presented. The example includes selection and calibration of the telemetry system and presentation of typical telemetered tire vibration data. 1976 SA E Transactions 760746. Capsule Torquemeter Development. Alfred F. Hegerich and James T. Grupczynski, Ford Motor Co. This report concerns the development of a small radio- telemetry torquemeter package intended to replace a current slip ring driveshaft torque meter system. Included in this report is a package description, a comparative test report and application recommendations. The torque- meter package developed can be used in any driveshaft, vehicle or otherwise, in place of a standard universal joint. Package constituents are a strain gaged universal joint cross and telemetry consisting of a modern FM trans- mitter and FM receiver. Transmitter power is available in battery form, or an inductive power supply can be built into the transmitter and receiver. The package was installed in series with a slip ring unit to conduct a comparative test utilizing both power supplies. Test results were not influenced by power supply and indicate identical data. 760748. Testing Times. Robert H. Macmillan, Institution of Mechanical Engineers. The author first draws on his experiences in the Royal Air Force and also teaching in universities, in Cambridge, England; M.I.T.; Wales; France, and Holland, to describe a number of interesting technical devices, some of which have yet to be marketed, possibly on account of economic obstacles. The second part is devoted to a discussion of some of the more recent test facilities installed in the laboratories and on the Proving Ground of the Motor Industry Research Association. The paper ends with a consideration of some of the outstanding basic problems of vehicle research. 760752. Carburetor Deposits - Are Clean Throttle Bodies Enough? D. W. Hall and L. M. Gibbs, Chevron Research Co. Carburetor throttle body deposits are known to be very critical toward upsetting exhaust emissions and increasing fuel consumption. This study showed that other carbu- retor areas are just as important. Deposits in the idle air bleed-metering cluster and venturi sections caused sizable increases in emissions and fuel consumption. Because carburetor deposits can cause large deviations from the designed air-fuel metering characteristics, it is extremely important to keep them from forming. Most carburetor detergents work only in the throttle body area. Because upper carburetor deposits were shown to be critical, additives are needed to control deposits throughout the carburetor. 760753. Cycle by Cycle Variations of HC, CO, and NOx. H. C. Watson, L. C. Goldsworthy and E. E. Milkins, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Uni- versity of Melbourne (Australia). The effect of combustion time and combustion variability on performance and emissions was investigated with a single cylinder CFR spark ignition engine using gaseous fuel (propane). A system was developed which allowed the collection of the products of combustion of individual engine cycles. This system consisted of an electrically operated gas sampling valve drawing gas from immedi- ately behind the exhaust valve, and an electronic dis- criminator/valve driver system. Engine cycles were se- lected for sampling according to the time for flame propagation to a point in the combustion chamber diametrically opposite the spark site, this being a strong indicator of total combustion time. Flame arrival was detected with an ionisation probe. A Gas Chromatograph and a modified Chemiluminiscent NOx analyser were used for gas analysis. For any particular engine operating point, flame propagation time varies randomly from cycle to cycle (cycle by cycle variability). Thus, by using the system described, it was possible to study the way in which total combustion time and combustion phasing affect com- bustion product formation and the effect of combustion variability on resultant bulk exhaust emissions. Experiments performed with varying spark timing were used to predict the effect of combustion time on NOx and efficiency for optimum power combustion phasing. Reduction in NOx, together with an increase in efficiency is predicted as a consequence of careful selection of combustion time. A simple model was constructed to correlate (semi- 106</page><page sequence="94">760754 - 760759 empirically) the measured NOx values at MBT spark .against an effective combustion temperature and mass fraction of oxygen. The effective combustion temperature was taken to be a function of combustion time and equivalence ratio. This simple model yielded good prediction of measured NOx values. Graphs of CO, HC, NOx, A/F against combustion time are presented for a number of engine operating points. The cycle-by-cycle variations of HC, CO NOx and combustion time are presented in non-dimensional form (coefficient of variation) against equivalence ratio. NOx is found to be extremely sensitive to combustion time. CO and HC are much less sensitive but do show significant variations under certain operating conditions, indicating that control of combustion variability would be advan- tageous in reducing emissions as well as improving power and thermal efficiency. 760754. A Study of Carburetion Effects on Power, Emissions, Lean Misfire Limit, and EGR Tol- erance of a Single-Cylinder Engine. J. A. Har- rington, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. The influence of carburetor characteristics on power, emissions, lean misfire limit and EGR tolerance has been investigated using a single-cylinder engine. The results, which are based on the use of a conventional carburetor and a modified version of the same carburetor, indicate that the lean limit and EGR tolerance are extended when time variations in fuel flow ("spiking" of A/F) are reduced and the mixture is made more homogeneous. The amount of extension varies with engine load, being largest at the lighter loads studied. Power, CO and NOx emissions of the engine are insensitive to the carburetion effects at common values of engine air flow rate and A/F. The HC emissions are affected at all but the richest A/F values investigated. 760755. Stratified Charge Engines. R. A. Haslett and M. L. Monaghan, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd.; and J. J. McFadden, United States Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. The objectives of this project were to determine the acceptability of various types of stratified charge engines as potential power plants for light duty vehicles and motorcycles in America. The light duty vehicle considered was a four/five seat compact sedan with good acceleration capabilities and exhaust emissions below a primary target of 0.41 g/mile HC, 3.4 g/mile CO, 1.5 g/mile NOx. A secondary target of 0.41 g/mile HC, 3.4 g/mile CO and 0.4 g/mile NOx was also considered. A literature survey was undertaken, comparing strat- ified charge engines with examples of good conventional gasoline and diesel engines. While some stratified charge engines had exhaust emission or fuel economy advan- tages, there were always sacrifices in other areas. Eleven engines were configured, four of which were specifically directed towards the secondary emission targets. A method of rating the engines was derived, and the design concepts were compared with two gasoline engines by a jury panel. The overall result was that the Ford PROCO and Honda CVCC combustion processes were serious contenders to the gasoline engine at the primary emission target, and that both of these systems, together with the VW combustion process, might be suitable at the secondary targets. 760757. Development of Toyota Lean Burn Engine. M. Noguchi, S. Sanda and N. Nakamura, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). This engine has been developed to achieve lean combus- tion. A prechamber which is named as the Turbulence Generating Pot (TGP) was developed to extend the lean misfire limit and also to increase flame propagation velocity. The lean misfire limit and the combustion velocity depend on the configuration of the TGP and also on the spark plug location. The jet flame from the TGP creates a strong turbulence in the main combustion chamber resulting in a high velocity propagation of the flame. NOx emission is reduced to a minimal level due to the strong turbulence generated by the TGP. 1976 SA E Transactions 760758. Investigation of a Turbulent Flame Propagation Model for Application for Combustion Prediction in the S.I. Engine. B. S. Samaga, Karnataka Regional Engineering College (India); and B. S. Murthy, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Inst, of Technology (India). This paper is a follow-up of the authors' earlier paper in which the development and evaluation of a mathematical model for turbulent flame propagation in the S.I. Engine had been described. The present paper gives a report of further studies regarding the general applicability of this model for S.I. engine combustion prediction. A simplified scheme has also been suggested to predict the pollutant emission by a correlation of the computed equilibrium mole fractions to the measured emission levels of 'CO' and 'NOx' in the exhaust. A wide variety of operating conditions has been considered and the model is applied in a simulation program to compute the combustion and exhaust emission characteristics for each operating con- dition. The predicted results, in general, are in conformity with the experimentally measured results reported in literature. 760759. Two-Stage Combustion for Low Emissions with- out Catalytic Convertors. John Houseman and D. J. Cerini, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cali- fornia Inst, of Technology. The concept of using two-stage combustion in a spark ignition engine has been tested in a single cylinder CFR engine. The engine was operated over an equivalence ratio 107</page><page sequence="95">760760-760765 range of 1.5 to 2.2 to evaluate the first stage of combustion. The product gas was analyzed for H2, CO, C02, and hydrocarbons. An atmospheric burner was operated with gasoline over the same equivalence ratio range of 1.5-2.2, and the resulting product gases were then burned in the CFR engine to test the second stage of combustion. Emissions of NOx, HC and CO of 0.1, 0.1, and 5 gm/IHP-hr were measured respectively. The engine indicated efficiency for the two-stage mode was essentially the same as for the single-stage mode. 760760. What Limits Lean Opération in Spark Ignition Engines - Flame Initiation or Propagation? Ather A. Quader, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The lack of clearly identified constraints for ignition and flame propagation has hindered understanding the pro- cesses which limit lean operation in spark ignition engines. This experimental study explores flame initiation and flame propagation as limits of lean operation in engines. In separate tests conducted in a single-cylinder CFR (cooperative fuel research) engine, the spark timing was either advanced or retarded from MBT in order to determine the ignition-limit or partial-burn-limit spark timings, respectively. These two limiting spark timings were found to converge at lean mixtures. At the MBT lean misfire limit, the ignition-limit, and the partial-burn-limit spark timing lines converged. Apparently flame initiation as well as flame propagation considerations constrain lean operation. The effects of engine and ignition system- related variables on the ignition and partial-burn limits are presented and discussed. Discussion: Donald J. Patterson, University of Michigan. 1976 SA E Transactions 760761. The Prediction of Heat and Mass Transfer During Compression and Expansion in I.C. Engines. M. S. Chong, E. E. Milkins and H. C. Watson, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Uni- versity of Melbourne. The mathematical equations describing the momentum, energy and mass exchanges in non-firing engine cylinders are described and solved. Attention is confined to laminar flow in axi-symmetric cylinders. Pressure development and velocity prediction, for plane cylindrical combustion chambers, compare favourably with experimental meas- urements for compression and expansion in motored engines. At engine speeds less than 100 rev/min the piston motion induces a toroidal vortex during compression whose direction is not reversed on expansion. Conductive heat transfer at higher engine speeds, 600-1000 rev/min, adequately describes the gas-wall heat-transfer. Flow patterns are also predicted for a diesel-type bowl in piston configuration. 760762. Vapourization of Fuel Drops on a Hot Plate. B. S. Murthy and R. Natarajan, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Inst, of Technology (India); and K. K. Ramalingam, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Engineering College (India). Life times and behaviour of fuel drops, vapourizing on a hot plate in open and closed atmospheres were recorded. The vapourizing mass was photographed sequentially. The parameters varied are: (1) fuel (iso-octane, n-heptane, a-methyl naphthalene and n-hexadecane), (2) ambient atmosphere (air and nitrogen), (3) ambient pressure (1,2,3,5 and 9 atm. abs.) and (4) plate temperature (50 to 350°C). Differences were observed in the vapourization characteristics. The size, shape and vapourization rate of film boiling drops were analysed and compared with the predicted values. The predictions were made using two models (part sphere and sphere) for different drop volumes. Reasonable agreement was observed. 760763. Simulation and Evaluation of Exhaust and Intake System of a Four-Stroke Spark Ignition Engine. M. K. Gajendra Babu, Inst, of Space and Aeronautical Science, Univ. of Tokyo (Japan); and B. S. Murthy, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, Indian Inst, of Technology (India). A mathematical model for the gas exchange process and to estimate the pressure, temperature, velocity and mass flow rate at selected points in the exhaust and intake systems of a 4 stroke, single cylinder spark ignition engine is described. In order to evaluate the model, the computed data of gas pressure in intake system was compared with the experimental data while for the exhaust, the compar- ison included gas pressure and velocity. A satisfactory correlation was observed between the computed and test data. 760764. Pulsed Plasma Ignltor for Internal Combustion Engines. Dennis J. Fitzgerald, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. Preliminary test results are presented on a new type of ignition system which is designed to permit operation of an internal combustion engine in the ultralean region where there is a potential of reducing NOx emissions and increasing engine efficiency. The new ignition system utilizes electromagnetic body forces to drive the ignition kernel into the combustion chamber acting, in effect, as an extended multiple source. The high current (~1000 amperes) produced during the ignitor discharge induces a local magnetic field of sufficient magnitude to realize a JXB body force which accelerates the discharge plasma. The system is compatible with conventional ignition systems and does not require any basic engine modifi- cations. 760765. Evaluation of Burned Gas Ratio (BGR) as a Predominant Factor to NOx. Tadahide Toda, Hidetaka Nohira and Kiyoshi Kobashi, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). To elucidate the effects of EGR, the gas compositions in the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke, have 108</page><page sequence="96">760766 - 760771 been analyzed. The relationship of the burned gas fraction in the cylinder (defined as BGR) to NOx emission and misfire limit have been investigated and imply the following: 1) NOx and misfire limit are strongly affected by the BGR at specified air fuel ratio and spark timing. 2) Gas-fuel ratio which is the ratio of the total gas to the fuel in the cylinder is the predominant factor used extensively to evaluate the effects of EGR and/or lean mixture on NOx and misfire limit of an engine. 1976 SA E Transactions 760766. Exhaust Port Heat Rejection in a Piston Engine a Preliminary Report. James H. Rush, Ford Motor Co. While it is well known that engine exhaust temperature has an exponential effect on the thermal oxidation of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons and that the exhaust temperatures of seemingly similar engine designs vary markedly, little is known regarding the effect of exhaust port design on exhaust temperature. This paper describes an experimental program currently in progress that defines the magnitude of heat loss in exhaust ports and the effect of some geometric design variables and of several exhaust port liner designs on exhaust heat loss. The paper reveals that a port designed for minimum heat transfer may result in a 250° F increase in exhaust gas temperature. These results indicate a significant reduction in radiator requirements as well as for greatly improved thermal reactor performance. 1976 SA E Transactions 760767. An Analytical Study of Exhaust Gas Heat Loss in a Piston Engine Exhaust Port. S. D. Hires, Ford Motor Co.; and G. L. Pochmara, Eaton Corp. A mathematical model of exhaust port heat loss was evolved using an electrical analog of heat transfer. Good correlation with experimental results is demonstrated for comparatively simple design variables. The critical effects of limiting metal-to-metal contact between port liner and port wall is predicted. The limitations of the present model for studies involving complex design variables is dis- cussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760768. (SP-412) A Mathematical Model to Predict Skull Fracture Under Impact Loads. Nicholas Perrone, Office of Naval Research; Engineering School, Catholic University. The significant correlation of skull fracture with fatal head injury suggests such fracture prevention to be a useful minimal design criterion. A spherical cap under dynamic local loading is recommended as an effective mathe- matical model to assess skull fracture. With finite difference techniques in space and time, the governing large deformation cap equations are solved for a circular load area. For load pulses of practical significance, the only parameters of concern are load area, load amplitude, skull thickness and maximum allowable stress. Curves are presented of fracture load with load area for various skull thicknesses. Results suggest that increasing the load area greatly diminishes the possibility of fracture. Hence, helmet and vehicle designers should aim towards this end. 760769. (SP-412) Three Dimensional Model of the Hu- man Head and Neck for Automobile Crashes. Jeffrey C. Huston, Dept. of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Iowa State University; and Sunder H. Advani, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering and Mechanics, West Virginia Univer- sity. A comprehensive three dimensional model of the human head and neck is formulated. This model predicts the center of mass displacements, velocities, and accelerations of the head and neck resulting from contact and/or inertial impact forces. Key anatomical components are incorporated in this model along with a joint stopping mechanism. Known acceleration profiles are inputed to the torso and/or head force time histories are specified. The equations of motion are then derived using d'Alem- bert's form of Lagrange's Principle and are numerically integrated using a fourth order Runge-Kutta technique. Validation is accomplished by the comparison of re- sponses from (i) direct frontal and occipital impact experiments on human cadavers, and (ii) sled tests conducted on human volunteers. 760770. (SP-412) Neuromuscular Cervical Spine Model for Whiplash. U. R. Pontius and Y. K. Liu, Biomechanics Laboratory, Dept. of Ortho- paedics, Tulane University Medical School. A computer model of the neuromusculature and passive elements of the cervical spine during whiplash is pre- sented. The model indicates that the neuromusculature increases the rotational stability of the cervical spine during low level accelerations. This results in decreased bending but increased axial compressive stresses in the passive structures and increased axial tensile stresses in the neuromusculature. Increased neural feedback aug- ments peak acceleration and stress because the "active" neuromusculature causes a flexion response near the end of the acceleration pulse. A decrease in neural delay time allows the muscles to act earlier and decrease peak accelerations and bending stresses. 760771. (SP-412) A Biodynamic Model of the Human Spinal Column. S. A. Tennyson and A. I. King, Biomechanics Research Center, Wayne State University. A biodynamic model of the spine simulated the action of spinal musculature on the head, vertebral bodies and pelvis in the midsagittal plane. Muscle was treated as a force generator whose contractile force was dependant on muscle stretch, stretch rate and neural delay time. Eight 109</page><page sequence="97">760772 - 760777 model runs were conducted with and without muscle, simulating + Gz and -Gx impact acceleration. The model predicted that spinal musculature was incapable of affecting overall spinal column kinematics. However, as a result of muscle contraction, significantly higher local axial forces were predicted in the discs and facets than were predicted when muscle was absent. 1976 SA E Transactions 760772. (SP-412) Identification of Mathematical Models from Impact Data: Application to Thoracic Im- pact. Joseph C. Free, James W. Hall and Cesar A. Montano, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham Young University. This paper illustrates a method for deriving the param- eters of mathematical models from impact data. An error measure between the model and the experimental data is proposed which avoids repeated simulations of model response. This error measure is formulated for a simple model of the chest utilizing the data of Kroell, et al. The error is minimized using both gradient and nongradient optimization techniques to obtain model parameters. The reasonable correlation between model and experiment indicated that the method proposed may be a useful tool to researchers in the field. 760773. (SP-412) Investigation of Impact Response and Fracture of the Human Femur by Finite Element Modeling. David C. Viano and Tawfik B. Khalil, Biomedical Science Dept., Research Laborato- ries, General Motors Corp. The mechanical response of a plane strain finite element model depicting an axial midsection of a human femur is investigated for both static and dynamic condylar load- ings. An elastic bi-medium structure composed of com- pact and cancellous bone is used to represent the femur. Critically stressed locations are identified and asso- ciated static and dynamic load levels which may initiate femur fracture are calculated. The predicted fracture sites and load levels are found to be in good agreement with published data for cadaver knee impacts. An important conclusion of this investigation is that the peak stress or strain and therefore femoral tolerance significantly de- pends on the impact duration due to stimulation of structural resonances. 760774. (SP-412) The Effectiveness of Mathematical Models as a Human Analog. Georg D. Frisch, Joseph O'Rourke and Louis D'Aulerio, Crew Systems Dept., Naval Air Development Center. This paper analyzes data on the dynamic response of the living human head and neck to -Gx impact acceleration. The Calspan "3D Computer Simulator of a Motor Vehicle Crash Victim," Ultrasystems "Crash Victim Simulator - Light Aircraft" and Boeing Computer Services "Pro- metheus" were used to provide estimates of the responses monitored. Inputs to the programs were made as com- parable as program restrictions would allow. Outputs were compared to each other as well as to the corresponding human test run. Program outputs proved to be consistent but failed to adequately replicate human results. Inclusion of head to neck articulation did not by itself improve results. Relocation of the head pivot away from the occipital condyles or introduction of muscular activity was indicated. 760775. (SP-412) Stability Considerations in the Math- ematical Reconstruction of Traffic Accidents. Peter Niederer, Inst, for Biomedical Engineer- ing, Swiss Federal Inst, of Technology; and Felix Walz, Inst, for Forensic Medicine, Uni- versity of Zurich. Computerized simulations of traffic accidents are done for research and for reconstruction purposes. Motions of several interacting bodies, however, are prone to be highly instable. Meaningless results can therefore be produced. Two methods are introduced which allow for an assess- ment of the stability of a motion. The results obtained seem to support the hypothesis that all accident motions are instable to some degree. In each accident situation to be simulated or reconstructed on a computer it has therefore to be decided whether the appearing instabilities are tolerable or not. Two field examples are shown which exhibit tolerable and intolerable instabilities. 760776. (SP-412) Computer Aids for Accident Investi- gation. Raymond R. McHenry, Transportation Research Dept., Calspan Corp. Correlation of injury with the nature and severity of the acceleration exposure in actual highway accidents is complicated by problems with uniformity in the inter- pretation of accident evidence. The SMAC and CRASH computer programs have been developed with the objec- tive of providing aids for interpretation of physical evidence. Through the use of such aids in accident studies, it is possible to establish injury thresholds and mecha- nisms for living humans in relatively detailed exposures and under different conditions of restraint and protection. In addition to providing refined measures of the per- formance of protective devices, such studies can provide an improved basis for evaluation of test devices (i.e., anthropomorphic dummies and other surrogate crash victims). The existing forms and the evidence requirements of the SMAC and CRASH programs are described and results of pilot application studies are presented and discussed. The operating costs of the two programs are defined, and the anticipated future courses of devel- opment and application are outlined. 760777. Automobile Driver Characteristics and Capabil- ities - The Man-Off-The-Street. Roy S. Rice, Transportation Research Dept., Calspan Corp., Fred Dell'Amico, Consulting Engineer; and 110</page><page sequence="98">760778 - 760782 Richard E. Rasmussen, General Motors Proving Ground. Loss of vehicle control accounts for a significant number of high severity accidents involving single vehicles in non-urban areas and, research indicates, is often directly attributable to the driver. In order to identify specific aspects of the driving task that are not adequately performed so that countermeasures can be developed, clinical approaches have been applied to the study of driver behavior. This paper presents the results of one such clinical driver behavior study conducted by the Calspan Corporation for General Motors. 1976 SA E Transactions 760778. Effects of Automobile Steering Characteristics on Driver/Vehicle Performance for Regulation Tasks. Duane McRuer and Richard Klein, Systems Technology, Inc. Driver and driver/vehicle system dynamic behaviors were examined in a regulation driving task wherein the driver maintains the car within a lane in the presence of random gust-like disturbances. Changes in vehicle dynamics, and insertion of the simulated gust, were accomplished using a variable stability automobile. The experiments showed that the drivers adjusted their dynamics to keep some driver/vehicle system properties essentially constant. The regulation task measurements were interpreted as effective open-loop system describing functions. From these data, objective measures of system bandwidth, stability, effective time delay, and closed-loop damping were deduced and compared as functions of vehicle dynamics and driver gender. The key system dynamic characteristics held constant by driver adjustments, and the nature of these adjustments, were also indicated by these data. 760779. Driver Performance in Controlling a Driving Simulator with Varying Vehicle Response Char- acteristics. Brian S. Repa, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; and Walter W. Wier- wille, Virginia Polytechnic Inst, and State Univ. This paper describes the effects of variations in vehicle response characteristics on driver-vehicle disturbance responses using a moving base driving simulator. Two exploratory studies are discussed, one dealing with vehicle transient response characteristics and the other with steady state characteristics. Close correspondence with full-scale data reported by others indicates that dynam- ically realistic simulators can be effective research tools. The flexibility of the simulator has facilitated the collection of other preliminary data which extend the full-scale findings. Considerably more effort will be needed, however, before strong arguments either for or against specific parameter boundaries can be made. 1976 SA E Transactions 760780. Vehicle Controllability and Human Response Characteristics. Keisuke Yoshimori, Nissan Mo- tor Co., Ltd. This paper outlines a method for predicting the con- trollability of a given vehicle through the use of a dynamic model of that vehicle and the response characteristics of a driver, both of which have been developed by the author. The driver's response characteristics consist of his sensitivity to the degree of a vehicle's deviation from its course, its deviation velocity and deviation acceleration. This simulation model has proven to be appropriate by comparing the simulation computation results with actual test results of lane changing, slaloming and behavior against side wind. 760781. Catalytic Converter Temperature Tests. Robin T. Harrison, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service Equipment Development Center. In June 1975, the Forest Service Equipment Development Center at San Dimas, Calif., conducted tests to determine exhaust system temperatures on late-model vehicles. For normal operation, test results showed only small temper- ature differences at any point on a vehicle's exhaust system between those equipped with catalytic converters and those without catalytic converters. Also, test results indicate that the direct forest fire hazard from catalytic converter-equipped vehicles is essentially the same as with other exhaust systems, except when the vehicle engine malfunctions. 760782. Toyota's Inspection System for Vehicular Emis- sions at Assembly Lines. T. Tanaka, H. Nakano, I. Usami and N. Abe, Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. (Japan). Since the automobile emission requirements of both the United States and Japan became very stringent for the 1975 model year vehicles, very sophisticated emission control devices have been installed on the vehicles and further engine modifications have been performed. In order that all of our production vehicles may satisfy the emission requirements and be free from possible defects such as catalytic converter damage, we have developed and put into actual use a system called ECAS which allows us to assure satisfactory basic emission performance levels at assembly lines. This system consists of the following four tests: Idle Test, Functional Test, Short Cycle Test and Steady State Inspection Test. By using this system, all operations from vehicle setup, on a chassis dynamometer to statistical analysis of the data, measurement, judgement of the obtained data, type-out of the results, indication for action to be taken, data filing and statistical treatment of the data, are processed automatically and controlled by the computer. In the Short Cycle Test the up-stream emissions of the vehicle, tracing Toyota's unique short cyclic mode on a chassis dynamometer, are continuously measured. Based on the emission levels during each mode and the total emission level obtained from the above test we 111</page><page sequence="99">760783-760791 can diagnose, not only the emission control systems of a vehicle and its engine conditions such as valve clearance maladjustment and carburetor defects, but also the emission characteristics of this vehicle when tested by the FTP. 760783. Development of Canistering Systems for Mono- lithic Catalysts. Jörg Abthoff and Kurt Oblānder, Daimler-Benz AG (Germany); and E. and A. Santiago, Zeuna-Stärker (Germany). The paper contents the description of two different canister systems for monolithic catalysts. The first version is an underhood system fitted directly to the exhaust manifold, which has to stand a very high exhaust gas temperature impact as well as gas pulsations and engine vibrations. The difficulties to overcome both thermal expansion effects and dimension tolerances of the monolithic units are explained based on test results. The second version is a ceramic wrapping canister system developed for an underfloor catalyst configuration, which because of the lower thermal and mechanical loads can be designed in a more cost-efficient manner. 760785. Designing Parking Brake Systems for Lower Efforts. Alan J. Cross, Sparton Manufacturing Co. FMVSS 105-75 imposed maximum effort to be applied to the parking brake on passenger vehicles to hold the vehicle on 20% and 30% grades. The previous unlimited regulation had allowed vehicles to be built with grade parking efforts beyond the ability of many drivers. For the Ford vehicle range, an average improvement of 40% was required to comply with the new regulation. This paper describes the program entered into by Ford to establish the most cost effective method of achieving the improve- ment. 760786. Automatic Adjusters for Passenger Car Disc Brakes. A. W. Harrison, Girling Ltd. Accurate adjuster clearance is of vital importance in large passenger cars. It directly improves parking brake effec- tiveness with any operating system and in addition more than doubles the advantage which can be gained from variable velocity ratio linkages. Good knock back resis- tance and load insensitivity are the essential qualities which an adjuster must have to achieve accurate clearance control. A new type of adjuster has been designed which is specially well protected from pad knockback effects, and also provides load insensitivity without the customary use of an extra hydraulic seal. 1976 SA E Transactions 760788. Structural Analysis of Automotive Brake Drums. Robert C. Petrof, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. An investigation has been undertaken of the distortion and stresses in brake drums due to applied loads. The analytical technique employs the thin-shell theory due to V. V. Novozhilov in an orthotropic shell-of-revolution computer program by means of which the governing differential equations are solved with finite-difference mathematics. Analytically-predicted results for drum response are given for several loading conditions, and deflections are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results in one particular laboratory test loading configuration. Application can be expected to problems of brake drum design and drum materials substitution. 1976 SA E Transactions 760789. A Data Acquisition Method for Dynamic Vehicle Testing. John C. Abromavage and Richard L. Beemer, Amerco Technical Center. This paper discusses the development and construction of a Mobile Telemetry Instrument Facility (MTIF) used for the acquisition of dynamic vehicle test data by the Amerco Technical Center. Objectives of the MTIF are maximum flexibility, highest degree of accuracy, and quickest response during dynamic test activities. The latest data telemetry, recording and reduction technology is incorporated in the facility. Selection and application of the instrumentation such as light beam oscillographs, Mecca or floating ground systems, environmental control, on-line data analysis and instrument calibration equipment are explained. Also covered are the advantages of such a mobile facility over a permanent operation base. 760790. An Analysis and Evaluation of Unconventional Methods of Passenger Car Braking. Frank H. Highley, General Motors Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. (retired). A wide variety of devices which might be used to provide passenger car braking are analyzed. Devices based on reaction principles as well as those involving forces between the car and the road are evaluated from the standpoint of their performance characteristics and their size and weight. It is concluded that none of the methods or devices considered appears useful for general braking applications, but that some may serve as auxiliary braking means or for special applications. 760791. Interactive Trailer Towing Simulation. Louis A. C. Barbarek, Richard L. Chiapetta and Owen J. Viergutz, IIT Research Institute. The interactive use of a vehicle-trailer handling model is presented. The model is a high resolution simulation of general vehicle (passenger cars to multitrailer) handling, braking, and vehicle-barrier interaction which is exercised interactively with a "human driver" over a realistic road (pavement, shoulder, median strip, etc.). At all times during the simulation, the operator can simulate the use of any normally available controls, i.e., steering, braking, throttle. The model has been developed and/or used over a number of years under various contracts with NHTSA, 112</page><page sequence="100">760792 - 760797 FHWA, DOD, and a number of industrial companies. Included in the paper are the results of a simulation run involving driver performance, vehicle parameters, and roadway conditions. 1976 SA E Transactions 760792. Design and Development of a Disc Brake Caliper for Small Cars. Charles T. Hoffman, Delco- Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. A new light weight front disc brake caliper design, referred to as the 7000 Series design, has been developed by Delco Moraine and is currently being used on the 1976 Chevrolet Chevette. Features of this design include: 1. Light weight, single piston, sliding caliper design utilizing only 18 component parts. 2. Short overall caliper length with single bolt mounting, allowing versatility of fitting within restricted environments. 3. Caliper mounting sliding members better protected from corrosive elements. 4. Braking reaction forces taken along cylinder area of housing, in line with friction forces. 5. Bracket mount to a light weight forged knuckle. 6. Integral lining wear sensor. 7. Simplified serviceability. 8. Free-floating design concept allows the caliper to follow the rotor. 760793. Development of Crash Energy Management Solutions. Hermann Danckert, Volkswagen werk AG (Germany). The mechanical properties of today's vehicle are inves- tigated as a basis for favorable crash energy management solutions. Important parameters follow the similarity law of Cauchy. Different concepts of intervehicular compat- ibility are discussed. The tolerable closing speeds depend- ing on the mass ratio and accelerations of colliding vehicles are calculated using realistic data of deformation forces, human load tolerances and different restraint system characteristics. Engine effects and measures to reduce engine aggressiveness are investigated. Possible solutions for accident types other than frontal collisions are briefly discussed. 760794. Development of a System of Comparable Car Classes for Fuel Economy Labeling. Barry D. McNutt, Diane Pirkey and Robert Dulla, Fed- eral Energy Administration. The Federal Energy Administration analyzed possible approaches to classifying passenger automobiles to fulfill the requirements of Section 506 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for the labeling of 1977 and later model year cars with fuel economy information for the indi- vidual car and other "comparable cars" in its class. Weight, wheelbase, price, fuel economy, performance, exterior size, interior passenger space, and cargo (trunk) volume were examined as possible parameters for esta- blishing car classes. To facilitate data handling, computer programs were developed to rank the representative sample of approximately 150 domestic and foreign vehicles of the 1976 new car fleet and sort them into classes. The interrelationship of these parameters, their rele- vance to buyer perception and vehicle utility, as measured by exterior and interior volume, and traditional marketing patterns were studied and used as the basis for making the selection of interior volume (including cargo or trunk space) as the class index parameter. A system with five classes for cars and three classes for station wagons based on the interior volume index relates well to vehicle utility and will be applicable to future vehicles. The use of the volume measurements as a tool for analyzing vehicle design is briefly discussed. 760795. Light Duty Automotive Fuel Economy - Trends Through 1977. J. D. Murrell, R. G. Pace, G. R. Service and D. M. Yeager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The fuel economy data compiled by the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) has been analyzed to determine the trends in passenger car fuel economy beginning with model year 1958. Light duty truck fuel economy has been examined beginning with the 1976 model year. This paper adds the 1977 model year data to the historical trend and concentrates on the comparisons between the 1976 and 1977 models and the 1977 California and 49-state fleets. Calculation procedures have been used on the pas- senger car data which allow the changes in fuel economy due to system optimization, new engine/vehicle combi- nations, and weight mix shifts to be determined separately for individual manufacturers and the fleet as a whole. The passenger car fleet consists of the 13 manufacturers which were certified by September 13, 1976. Seven manufac- turers comprise the light duty truck fleet. 760796. Fuel Consumption in European Passenger Cars Powered by Gasoline, Diesel, and Direct Injec- tion Stratified Charge Engines. A. Ciccarone, C. Antonini and U. Virgilio, Alfa Romeo Research Dept. (Italy). A comparison has been made between the fuel con- sumption of a typical European passenger vehicle pow- ered by gasoline, Diesel and Stratified Charge Engines having performance characteristics allowing equal vehicle acceleration. The study shows that on the average the gasoline and Diesel fuel consumption are similar, while with the S.C.E. a benefit of from 7-20% was observed. Compliance with the European regulations is the main exhaust emission constraint within the study that has been conducted. But, when available, exhaust emissions data for the U.S.E.P.A. "FTP" cycle have also been quoted. 760797. Development of a Movable Deformable Crash Barrier. Ulrich Seiffert and Ruediger Weissner, Volkswagon AG (Germany). 113</page><page sequence="101">760798 - 760802 Rigid moving barriers and deformable moving barriers are compared conceptually and analytically, and advantages of the deformable barrier in representing average vehicles are presented. Several physical concepts for controlled energy dissipation are described, and experimental test results given. Architecture and powerplant mass repre- sentation are discussed, and the need for field accident analysis as a basis for structural representations is stressed. 760798. A Laboratory Approach to Automobile Crash Experiments. Haluk Bekiroglu, Southern Illinois University. In this study an investigation is made into the crash phase of automobile intersection collisions. Analytical as well as experimental methods were used to show that the automobile crash phenomena may be explained macro- scopically by rigid body impact theory. Analysis of experimental results indicated the numerical range of the coefficient of friction between the colliding vehicles and the coefficient of restitution necessary to explain the crushing characteristics of the automobile structures and the final velocities at the end of the crash phase for different modes of intersection collisions. 760799. Cadaver and Dummy Knee Impact Response. J. D. Horsch, General Motors Corp.; and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State University. Knee impacts along the femoral axis of unembalmed male cadavers and Part 572 dummies were made with rigid pendulum impactors at Wayne State University. The dummy exhibited significantly higher knee impact forces than the cadaver subjects. This difference of response is shown to be due to differences of effective leg mass and knee padding. The dummy with its heavy rigid metal skeleton is not like its human counterpart, where the majority of the leg weight is composed of loosely coupled flesh. The knee impacts of the dummy subjects showed that the dummy femur transducer force was consistently less than the corresponding dummy knee impact force by a constant ratio of 0.8. We recommend that the "skeletal" weight of the Part 572 dummy leg should be substantially reduced, with the weight difference being added to a properly simulated leg flesh. Also, the simulated flesh covering of the knee should be modified to reduce the peak force resulting from rigid body impacts. 1976 SA E Transactions 760800. (P-66) The Effect of Duration, Rate of Onset and Peak Sled Acceleration on the Dynamic Response of the Human Head and Neck. C. L. Ewing, D. J. Thomas, L. Lustick, W. H. Muzzy, III, G. Willems and P. L. Majewski, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Detachment, Michoud Station, New Orleans, Louisiana. The parameters of duration, rate of onset and peak acceleration of the sled have been identified by other investigators as determinants of the dynamic and injury response of man. A series of human experiments have been conducted to measure the response of the head and the first thoracic vertebrae to these parameters. Each subject was run at three conditions defined as high rate of onset-long duration (HOLD), high rate of onset-short duration (HOSD) and low rate of onset-long duration (LOLD) at peak accelerations of 6, 10 and 15G. Comparison time profiles of angular acceleration, angular velocity and linear resultant acceleration at the head anatomical origin and horizontal linear acceleration at the Tļ origin are presented for 5 to 8 subjects at each of the three peak sled acceleration levels. Regression coefficients of peak values of the kinematic parameters of onset and duration as defined by the sled profile are developed, as well as coefficients based on similar parameters defined from the profile of linear acceleration at T,. 760801. (P-66) Comparison of Kinematic Parameters between Hybrid II Head and Neck System with Human Volunteers for -Gx Acceleration Profiles. William H. Muzzy, III and Leonard Lustick, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Detachment, New Orleans, Louisiana. Significant kinematic parameters of the head are com- pared between a Hybrid II head and neck (per Part 572, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208) and human volunteers subjected to the same -Gx sled acceleration profiles. Comparison time profiles between the dummy and human subjects for components of linear acceler- ation, velocity, and displacement of the head center of gravity and the first thoracic vertebral body (Tl) ana- tomical origin, as well as components of angular accel- eration, velocity, and displacement of the anatomical coordinate systems are presented for 6, 10, and 15G peak sled acceleration in the -Gx environment. Significant differences between the dummy and human volunteers are discussed in regard to peak values of parameters, time latencies, and overall shape agreement in a time window where motion is significant. 760802. (P-66) The Design and Use of the TRRL Side Impact Dummy. J. Harris, Transport and Road Research Laboratory. The lack of a suitable means of measuring levels of protection for car occupants in side impacts has hampered development of satisfactory designs of car to withstand impacts of this type by cars or other objects. The TRRL side impact dummy described in the paper has been designed specifically for this task and its use has been demonstrated in achieving a high level of protection for occupants of the Leyland Marina cars developed in the international car safety programme. The dummy makes possible the matching of each part of the energy absorbing 114</page><page sequence="102">760803 - 760808 inner face of the donor structure to the different loadings on the human frame, which can be safely tolerated at the shoulder, chest and pelvic regions. This paper describes the dummy and some of the testing to ascertain its suitability for impact test procedures, as well as describing how it was used to estimate levels of human tolerance to impact loadings in accidents and how it contributed to the design of the side structure of the modified Marina. 760803. (P-66) Results of Cadaver and Anthropomorphic Dummy Tests in Identical Crash Situations. Michael J. Walsh and David J. Romeo, Calspan Corporation. An experimental program is discussed wherein fresh, unembalmed cadavers and anthropomorphic test dum- mies (ATD's) were exposed to identical crash situations. Results include tests conducted on the Calspan HYGE acceleration sled and full-scale car crash tests using belt restraint systems and air bag systems. Cadaver test data obtained include head and chest triaxial accelerations from externally mounted sensors, chest deflections and belt loads. Cadaver test data also include arterial and lung pressure measurements as well as X-ray and gross necropsy evaluations. Dummy test data include normally measured internal triaxial head and chest accelerations. High-speed movie coverage produced cadaver and dum- my kinematic results. 760804. (P-66) Dynamic Dummy Behavior Under Dif- ferent Temperature Influence. Ulrich W. Seiffert and Heinz E. Leyer, Research and Develop- ment, Volks wagen werk AG, Germany. Dummy component calibration tests were performed as specified in 49-Part 572 with temperature as the inde- pendent variable. Well-defined, significant dependencies of results on temperature were recorded. Total system sled tests were then run with the assembled dummy at different temperatures. Differences were found both in injury- related data and in the type of kinematic motion during impact. 760805. (P-66) A Critical Assessment of the Use of Non-Human Responding Surrogates for Safety System Evaluation. Kenneth J. Saczalski, Office of Naval Research; John D. States, School of Medicine, University of Rochester; Ivan J. Wagar, Safety Helmet Council of America; and Edward Q. Richardson, Texas A&amp;M University. The basic physical mechanisms underlying recent exper- imentally observed anomalous behavior in the impact performance of safety helmets evaluated with soft (hu- man-like) and hard (magnesium alloy) headform surro- gates are qualitatively and quantitatively explained in this paper. The principal and physical mechanisms brought to light in the headform surrogate investigation are directly applicable to the utilization of other forms of surrogates (head-neck, thorax, whole body). In particular the results raise a serious question as to the validity of using non-human responding surrogates, with human generated injury tolerance data, for the purpose of assessing safety system performance. The implications of the results are that good crash-impact protective devices (helmets, restraints, etc.) could be penalized and, equally important, less safe crash-impact protective system designs could result from improper assessment of safety system per- formance. 1976 SA E Transactions 760806. (P-66) Occupant Protection in Lateral Impacts. F. Hartemann, C. Thomas, J. Y. Foret-Bruno, C. Henry, A. Fayon and C. Tarrière, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique de l'Asso- ciation Peugeot-Renault La Garenne-Colombes (92)-France. The frequency and severity of lesions sustained by the occupants of cars impacted laterally depend upon the main following factors: - impact localization, - intrusion into passengers' compartment, - car speed variation, - direction of occupant trajectory, - objects contacted by the various body areas. 296 lateral impacts are being described hereunder by means of factors below. Consequences are drawn therefrom as to the coming improvement of occupant protection taking account of the current state of the art in Biomechanics and automobile technique. 760807. (P-66) Safety Performance of Securiflex Wind- shield. L. M. Patrick and C. C. Chou, Wayne State University. An improved windshield with a special, thin, plastic inner surface attached to the inner surface of a three layer windshield similar to those used in the United States minimizes lacerations from occupant impact to the windshield during a collision. The plastic coats the sharp edges of the broken glass preventing or minimizing laceration. It was evaluated by comparing its laceration per- formance with that of a standard windshield in simulated barrier crashes at velocities up to 65 km/h. No lacerations resulted from impact to the Securiflex windshield at Barrier Equivalent Velocities up to 65 km/h. Substantial laceration resulted at velocities above 20 km/h with the standard windshield. It is concluded that the Securiflex windshield essentially eliminates lacerations in the particular vehicle involved at velocities up to at least 65 km/h. 760808. (P-66) Safety Comparison of Laminated Glass and Acrylic Glazing in Front Camper Windows. L. M. Patrick and W. D. Wickersham, Wayne State University. 115</page><page sequence="103">760809-760812 Children riding on the bed over the cab in campers can be injured in forward force collisions from striking the glazing material and/or being ejected through the opening. The two types of glazing commonly used are acrylic and laminated. A comparison of the performance of the two types of glazing in simulated forward force collisions at velocities up to 30 mph showed the acrylic material to pose threats of neck and back injury and the laminated material to result in lacerations. Ejections occurred with the acrylic that were not present with the laminated windshields when correct glazing techniques were used. With poor installation procedures, ejections occurred in both types of glazing materials. It is concluded that the best way to avoid injury is to prevent the child from riding in the over-the-cab bunk. If the child does ride there, his body axis should be positioned at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. Also, the front interior of the camper should be padded to minimize injury. Among the five injury criteria considered, laminated glass was substantially better in two of the criteria (neck extension and ejection), slightly better in two of the criteria (lumbar extension and concussion potential) and the acrylic was superior in terms of facial laceration potential. 760809. (P-66) Design, Test and Development of a Wheelchair Restraint System for Use in Buses. D. Orne, Department of Mechanical Engineer- ing, Wayne State University; E. Barak, De- partment of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and R. F. Fisch, Truck and Recreation Products Op- erations, Ford Motor Company. A contoured rear-facing restraint couch has been de- signed, fabricated and tested which protects wheelchair- confined passengers in simulated frontal barrier collisions at velocities of up to at least 25 mph and in simulated rear-end collisions. A cable system secures the wheelchair to the base of the restraint couch and is automatically engaged when the wheelchair is backed against the couch. A three-point belt system secures the passenger in rear-end collisions or during elastic rebound in frontal collisions. Plastic deformation of the couch framework limits g-loadings on passenger and couch even during severe impacts. 760810. (P-66) Automotive Seat Design and Collision Performance. D. M. Severy, D. M. Blaisdell and J. F. Kerkhoff, Severy, Inc. Eighty-five laboratory full-scale force-deflection tests were conducted on passenger vehicle seats, foreign and domes- tic, for purposes of evaluating specific resistance to a collision environment and mechanisms of collision in- duced seat distortion. These tests evaluated seats that span the past thirty years; additionally, seat design studies were conducted evaluating basic features of automotive seating during the past eighty years. Data from full-scale collision experiments and from a large number of actual accidents facilitated the estab- lishment of seat design criteria for greatly improved collision performance. Evolution of seat and head support standards in the United States and Europe are presented with evaluation of their relative significance to the requirements of automotive seat collision performance. The foregoing research provided foundation for modification of a production automobile seat into an integral safety seat, based on a design concept that minimizes bending moments during collision. The modi- fied seat was subjected to the same laboratory test procedure applied to the 85 non-modified production seats and results of its performance is given. Design concepts are presented that would serve to mitigate undesirable seat distortions during collision and thus improve seat restraint capabilities without compro- mising the important factors of comfort and cost. 1976 SA E Transactions 760811. (P-66) Car Occupant Fatalities and the Effects of Future Safety Legislation. D. K. Griffiths, H, R. M. Hayes, P. F. Gloyns, S. J. Rattenbury and G. M. Mackay, Accident Research Unit, Depart- ment of Transportation and Environmental Planning, University of Birmingham. This paper describes an analysis of a sample of over 300 fatally injured occupants of cars involved in accidents mainly between 1969 and 1976 in urban, rural and motorway environments of the United Kingdom. The sample is drawn from a retrospective field study of collisions conducted by examining cars at garages, and correlating that information with medical and road user data obtained from hospitals and by questionnaires. The sample is thought to be broadly representative of the U.K. occupant fatality situation. The injuries to all the fatally injured occupants are described in detail using the A.I.S. and the I. S.S. procedures. These injuries are then related to their most common sources, for specific crash configurations. The vehicle deformation is described in terms of the frequency and severity of various collision types, and then both injuries and deformation are reviewed in the light of existing and proposed safety legislation in Europe. The effect of compulsory seat belt use on this sample is estimated, and the consequences for other safety standards and their relative priorities are discussed. In particular the increased relative importance of side impact protection is noted. Other conclusions drawn are the need for improved passenger compartment integrity, and better compatability between trucks and small cars. 760812. (P-66) Bumper Characteristics for Improved Pedestrian Safety. D. G. C. Bacon and M. R. Wilson, Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd., Car Division, England. Impacts of bumpers on the legs of pedestrians are analysed by simulating accidents using comprehensively 116</page><page sequence="104">760813-760815 instrumented adult and child dummies with free-standing ability. The friction force between the feet and ground is found to be a significant factor in the kinematics of the pedestrian and his interaction with the bumper, vehicle and ground. The effects of bumper height, lead and deflection characteristics are evaluated experimentally in conjunction with a mathematical model of leg impact. Bumper impacts are not considered in isolation; results indicate that bumper positional requirements for reduced leg injury would be 12-14 in height and 5 in lead, but vehicle front end height is a more important factor in determining critical impacts of other body areas with the vehicle and ground. An energy absorbing bumper system with the facility to lift the leg on impact presents further possibilities of reducing loads on the leg. 760813. (P-66) Full-Scale Experimental Simulation of Pedestrian-Vehicle Impacts. K. W. Krieger, A. J. Padgaonkar and A. I. King, Wayne State University. A series of 10 full-scale experimental simulations of pedestrian-vehicle impact was carried out using cadavers and a 95th percentile anthropomorphic dummy. The test subjects were impacted laterally and frontally at 24, 32 and 40 km/h (15, 20 and 24 mph). Each subject was extensively instrumented with miniature accelerometers, up to a maximum of 53 transducers. The nine-accel- erometer scheme was used to measure angular acceler- ation of body segments from which it was possible to compute the head injury criterion (HIC) for cadaver head impact. A full-size Chevrolet was used as the impacting vehicle. The impact event was three-dimensional in nature during which the body segments executed complex motions. Dummy impacts were more repeatable than cadaver impacts but the response of these test subjects were quite different. The HIC was higher for head-hood impact than for head-ground impact in two of the cases analyzed. The acquired data could be used to validate existing three-dimensional gross motion simulators. 1976 impacts SA E Transactions 760814. (P-66) Biomechanics of Real Child Pedestrian Accidents. G. Sturtz, Institute of Automotive Engineering, Technical University Berlin, E. G. Suren, L. Götzen and S. Behrens, Accidental Surgical Clinic, Medical Highschool Hannover; and K. Richter, Institute for Pathology of the country capital Hannover at Hospital Nord- stadt. An optimisation of the vehicle exterior with regard to the pedestrian accident is only sensible with a view of the main groups of pedestrians. Contrary to dummy tests, of which advantages as well as disadvantages are sufficiently known, the correlation of dummy versus living human body versus dead tissue is eliminated in the analysis of real accidents, but gets extended by the parameter of age. Compared with laboratory tests, this method suffers from the disadvantage of middle errors in the estimated initial data, for instance the collision speed of the vehicle, which vary with every accident. Based on 230 medically and technically thoroughly worked out single-case analyses of real pedestrian acci- dents, including 128 accidents involving children, the influence of various parameters of vehicles and traffic participants on kinematics, injury mechanisms, and traumatising of the pedestrian accident are outlined. The main effort lies in the analysis of the biggest main- group-the child pedestrians, who are marked by pro- nounced differences in size and proportion as well as special mechanical strength of their bodies. 760815. (P-66) Comparison between Child Cadavers and Child Dummy by Using Child Restraint Systems in Simulated Collisions. D. Kallieris, J. Barz, G. Schmidt, G. Heess and R. Mattern, University of Heidelberg, West Germany. At present, numerous restraint systems for children applied in vehicles are in general considered for the use on the back seats. Up to now, only impact tests with dummies and animals have been carried through by these systems. Out of the great number of children seats and belts we used a system (deformable safety impact table combined with a lap-belt) which has been investigated by us during frontal impacts utilizing two dummies and four cadavers of children in the age of 2, 5 up to 1 1 years having body weights of 16 up to 31 kg. The tests have been conducted on the deceleration-sled track at the Institute of Legal Medicine of the University Heidelberg. Impact velocities of 30 km/h and 40 km/h at a medium deceleration of 20g have been chosen. None of the test subjects showed injuries to the inner organs; however, numerous muscular hemorrhages as well as hemorrhages of discs and liga- ments were noticed. The HIC values lay between 100 and 500; accelerations in x-direction up to 44g and in z-direction up to 85g occurred at the head. Lap-belt forces of 160 up to 400daN were measured. A weak point of the investigated system is that the child's movements are considerably limited, a factor also noticed in other child restraint systems; however, the protective function proved to be an advantage. The movements during the impact, pictured by highspeed cameras, essentially differ from those of adults wearing 3-point belts. The maximum flexion of the vertebral column is, due to the system, located in the transition of the thoracic to the lumbar vertebral column and the flexion angles amounted about 90°. As expected were the maximum head displacements in relation to a sled-fixed axis dependent on the impact velocity and the body height, and ranged between 50 cm (crash velocity 30 km/h, body height 97 cm) and 90 cm (crash velocity 40 km/h, body height 139 cm). The movements will be analysed; the anatomical and me- chanical causes are going to be investigated. Finally will the results be compared with similar dummy tests 117</page><page sequence="105">760816-760822 investigated by us. Due to these differences in the dummy and cadaver behavior the necessity is pointed out to examine all restraint systems by cadaver tests. 760816. (P-66) The Safe Deceleration of Infants in Car Crashes. Heinrich F. von Wimmersperg, Devel- opment Engineer and Consultant, Detroit; and Waldemar J. Czernakowski, Roemer-Wingard, Ulm, West Germany. The most important biomechanical characteristics of infants from birth to about six months are compiled in view of the development of adequate restraining devices for this group. The conventional engineering approaches are discussed, also a new method, a swinging bed. The long axis of the shell of this bed is placed perpendicular to the main axis of the vehicle on the rear seat. The top of the shell is attached at both sides by a strap to the vehicle frame for example by the adult belt. As the center of gravity of the shell plus infant is below the attachment points, the shell turns in a frontal crash. This transfers the impact load over a large area of the infant and also reduces the duration of maximal impact for each area element. The development from the first models for studying the kinematics to the final models for production is discussed. Results from European and United States sled tests are included. 760817. (P-66) Comparative Knee Impact Response of Part 572 Dummy and Cadaver Subjects. Charles K. Kroell and Dennis C. Schneider, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corporation, Warren, Michigan; and Alan M. Nahum, De- partment of Surgery, University Hospital, Uni- versity of California, San Diego. The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of whole body, target impingement knee impact response for a Part 572 dummy versus that for anthropometrically similar embalmed human cadavers. "Response" is defined here to include the impact force-time history as sensed by 1) femur load cells, and 2) impingement target load cells for the dummy and by the target load cells for the cadavers. The data presented demonstrate significantly higher peak forces and correspondingly shorter pulse durations for the dummy than for the companion cadaver subjects under similar test conditions and at all velocity levels investigated. For the dummy, the ratio of forces measured by the femur load cells to those measured by the impingement target load cells averaged eight tenths. 1976 SA E Transactions 760819. (P-66) Static and Dynamic Articular Facet Loads. N. S. Hakim and A. I. King, Wayne State University. Previous work on biodynamic response to whole-body + GZ (caudocephalad) acceleration gave ample evidence of facet loads in intact cadaveric spines. The computation of facet loads was based on an assumption that the total spine load was proportional to the measured seat pan load. In this study, the aim is to investigate the magnitude of the facet load during static and dynamic loading of an exised spinal segment. The applied loads resulted in a close simulation of those experienced by the intervertebral disc during whole-body impacts. An intervertebral load cell was used as the controlling mechanism in the duplication of the whole-body run in a testing machine. During these tests, both the total spine load and the intervertebral load were measured and thus the facet load was determined without relying on any assumptions. Results from tests on 5 different cadaveric spinal segments, involving 32 static runs and 62 dynamic runs, show that facet loads exist under both static and dynamic loading and that these joints were capable of carrying up to 40% of the total spine load. 1976 SA E Transactions 760820. (P-66) A Procedure for Estimating Injury Tol- erance Levels for Car Occupants. R. W. Lowne and J. G. Wall, Transport and Road Research Laboratory. This paper describes a method for estimating the levels and range of human injury tolerance by correlating injury information obtained in accident investigations with laboratory tests simulating the accident conditions using an anthropomorphic dummy. The technique is applied to injuries to restrained occupants attributable to the seat belt system and tolerance levels are suggested for use with the OPAT dummy when testing restraint systems incorporating seat belts. 760821. (P-66) Lumbar and Pelvic Orientations of the Vehicle Seated Volunteer. Gerald W. Nyquist, Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corporation; and Lawrence M. Patrick, Bio- mechanics Research Center, Wayne State Uni- versity. An X-ray radiographic study of two volunteers in a vehicle seated configuration was performed to gain insights into the lower torso skeletal geometry associated with this posture. A pseudo three-dimensional analysis of each radiogram was utilized to obtain quantitative results. The analyses provided indications of the pelvis and femur relative and absolute orientations. Further, the geometry of the lumbar spine and its location relative to the pelvis were defined. The relevance of the data from the standpoint of anthropomorphic dummy design is dis- cussed, and recommendations are offered for further studies of vehicle seat/vehicle occupant interfacing bio- mechanics. Anthropometric data on each volunteer are included. 1976 SA E Transactions 760822. (P-66) The Prediction of Thoracic Impact Inju- ries. D. H. Robbins, J. W. Melvin and R. L. 118</page><page sequence="106">760823 - 760826 Stalnaker, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. This paper presents the concepts and first group of test results from a project designed to: 1. Quantify thoracic impact response using cadaver and baboon subjects; 2. Compile analytical functions relating thoracic kinematic response to injuries observed in the experi- ments; and, 3. Define performance specifications insuring response fidelity between human and surrogate thoraxes. The experiments, which vary G-level, velocity, and direction of impact, utilize restraint systems including belts, airbags, and EA-columns. Resulting injuries are recorded at autopsy and an AIS rating assigned. Using the kinematic accelerometer data, injury-predictive functions are gen- erated using statistical regression procedures. The utili- zation of project results in developing performance specifications for surrogate thoraxes is discussed in conclusion. 1976 SA E Transactions 760823. (P-66) Thoracic Impact Response of Live Porcine Subjects. David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Department, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corporation, Warren, Michigan; and Charles Y. Warner, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. Five anesthetized porcine subjects were exposed to blunt thoracic impact using a 21 kg mass with a flat contact surface traveling at 3.0 to 12.2 m/s. The experiments were conducted to assess the appropriateness of studying in vivo mechanical and physiological response to thoracic impact in a porcine animal model. A comprehensive review of comparative anatomy between the pig and man indicates that the cardiovas- cular, respiratory and thoracic skeletal systems of the pig are anatomically and functionally a good parallel of similar structures in man. Thoracic anthropometry meas- urements document that the chest of a 50 to 60 kg pig is similar to the 50th percentile adult male human, but is narrower and deeper. Peak applied force and chest deflection are in good agreement between the animal's responses and similar impact severity data on fresh cadavers. A thorough autopsy, performed at the comple- tion of each test, revealed rib fracture injury patterns and thoracic organ hemorrhage levels which are similar to injuries produced in fresh cadavers. Other observations are that the living porcine model exhibits peak sternal accelerations, cardiovascular overpressures, resultant rib fractures and AIS ratings that are lower and spinal accelerations that are higher in amplitude than typical levels reported for pressurized fresh cadavers. 760824. (P-66) A High-Speed Cineradiographic Tech- nique for Biomechanical Impact. Max Bender, John W. Melvin and Richard L. Stalnaker, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Uni- versity of Michigan. A versatile high-speed cineradiographic system developed in the Biomechanics Department of The University of Michigan's Highway Safety Research Institute has re- cently been completed, for application to human injury and tolerance and occupant protection research. This system consists of a high-speed motion picture camera which views a 2-inch diameter output phosphor of a high gain 4-stage, magnetically focussed image intensifier tube, gated on and off synchronously with shutter pulses from the motion picture camera. A fast lens optically couples the input photocathode of the image intensifier tube to x-ray images produced on a fluorescent screen by a d-c x-ray generator. The system is adaptable to a wide variety of experimental configurations because: 1) screen size can be easily and inexpensively changed, and can be larger than the largest x-ray intensification tubes made; 2) the image intensifier tube is readily switchable over a wide range of pulse repetition rates and pulse widths, allowing motion picture frame rates closely matched to dynamic events under study; and 3) the system is not limited to a particular x-ray generator, or type of radiation source. Comparison of this system is made with existing high- speed cineradiographic systems, and advantages and disadvantages of this system are described. Examples of x-ray penetration of targeted human cadaver head, neck, knee, and lateral thorax views obtained with the system are shown and discussed. 760825. (P-66) An Experimental Model for Closed Head Impact Injury. Alan M. Nahum, M.D. and Randall W. Smith, M.D., Department of Sur- gery, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California. A series of blunt head impacts has been performed on stationary unembalmed human cadavers. The specimens were prepared to simulate realistic fluid pressures within the cerebrospinal fluid space and cerebral blood vessels. Translational acceleration- time histories of the head were recorded by biaxial accelerometers attached to the skull. Peak resultant head accelerations in excess of 3,000 m/s2 and pulse durations of 5 ms. or less were observed in a series of 10 experiments. The cerebral vascular system was perfused with a carbon particle tracer solution. Following impact, careful gross and microscopic pathologic studies of the cranial soft tissues were performed to assess vascular hemorrhage as represented by extravasation of tracer solution into the brain tissue. Data is presented describing the input forcing function, resultant head acceleration, and detailed necropsy findings. The results suggest that the use of this vascular trauma simulation technique may add additional information concerning acceptable acceleration-time limits for closed head injury. 1976 SA E Transactions 760826. Effect of Energy and Emission Constraints on 119</page><page sequence="107">760830 - 760836 Compression Ratio. James J. Gumbleton, George W. Niepoth and James H. Currie, Advance Product Engineering, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corporation. This paper describes the results of a study to evaluate the relationship of compression ratio on fuel energy conser- vation with the constraint of the 1977 Federal emission standards (1.5 HC, 15.0 CO and 2.0 NOx). The influence of the energy losses in the refinery process to produce higher octane fuels was considered as well as the effect of compression ratio on engine efficiency. Two different emission control systems were evaluated; a catalytic converter-EGR system and a manifold reactor-EGR system. These systems were evaluated on six vehicles; three intermediate size with 350 CID engines at com- pression ratios of 7.4, 8.3 and 9.2: 1 and three sub-compact size with 151 CID engines at the same three compression ratios. Based upon total energy conservation, there does not appear to be an incentive for increasing unleaded or leaded fuel octane levels to allow for the use of higher compression ratios with converter-EGR or reactor-EGR control systems at the 1977 Federal emission standards. In addition, the catalytic converter-EGR system appears to provide equal to or improved energy utilization compared to the reactor-EGR control system. Discussion: F. J.

The complexity and risk of buying or designing heavy duty trucks and their components, can be reduced by a simulation system which allows the truck to be evaluated on the routes the vehicle will be traveling. Over-the-road performance can be evaluated without building and testing a truck. This allows the evaluation of more alternatives at a fraction of the time and cost. 760831.

Wind Tunnel Investigation of the Effects of Installation Parameters on Truck Cooling System Performance. D. O. Taylor and A. C. Chu, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The effect of eight installation and component parameters on cooling system .heat rejection and air flow were examined in detail in a wind tunnel facility. A quarter- replicate, two level factorial test plan was followed. Within the ranges of each parameter tested, the fan characteristics and the projection of fan into the shroud are highly significant parameters. The fan to radiator distance, the radiator characteristics, and the fan tip to shroud clearance are significant parameters. The fan to engine block distance and the type of shroud are not significant parameters. 1976 SA E Transactions 760833. Diagnostics of Diesel Engines Using Exhaust Smoke and Temperature. Robert N. Hambright and H. S. Benson, Southwest Research Institute. An experimental sensor array that measures dynamic exhaust temperature and dynamic smoke for the purpose of diagnosing diesel engine fuel injection equipment was designed, built, and tested. The sensor array is portable and easily installed on truck tailpipes, and was tested using two 6V-53 Detroit Diesel engines. The dynamic temperature sensor is a very high response instrument capable of measuring changes in gas temperature in excess of 104°F/second. The dynamic smokemeter is an optical device designed to measure very low levels of light opacity in the smoke plume, with a response compatible with the engine firing frequency. Dynamic exhaust temperature data had more diagnostic significance than dynamic smoke in the detection of maximum power degrading fuel injection faults. Gaseous exhaust emissions (CO, C02, 02, NOx, and hydrocarbons) were also evaluated for their diagnostic merit and were found to be less significant than the dynamic temperature and smoke data under the no-load test constraints common to shop and field diagnosis. 760834.

An on-board system utilizing a general purpose micro- computer has been developed to monitor, record and display parametric data relative to truck function, con- dition and performance. The system provides a means to identify the performance signature of an individual truck in its operational environment over the road. It further provides a means to record this performance signature, track it with time and detect deterioration prior to breakdown. 760835. Automated Diagnostic System for Military Trucks. Ernst K.

It is the purpose of this paper to examine these specific areas including their beneficial potential, as well as the related problem considerations that are equally significant.

The rationale for a diagnostic analyzer which fully utilizes the mechanic in the test loop and rapidly provides diagnostic information on faults which are difficult and time consuming to accurately isolate manually is set forth. The translation of these requirements into realizable hardware is fully delineated. An operational test sequence as actually implemented for the testing of several different diesel engine types is given along with a presentation of the test results. 1976 SA E Transactions 760839.

Two new automatic transmissions, the MT644 and the MT654CR, have been developed to fill a market need for use with a class of heavy-duty, low-speed diesel engines. In the concepting, planning, designing and developing of these units, both domestic and overseas markets were analyzed, and current vehicle factors and trends were considered. The resulting products incorporate new or improved features such as increased capacity torque converter for high torque engines, increased flow oil pump for better cooling, and modulated converter lockup for greater fuel economy. Also goals of maximum commonality of parts with other current transmissions and of minimum impact on OEM installation requirements were achieved. 760841.

A Theory on the Relationship Between Drive Train Vibration and Belt-Driven Engine Cooling Fan Fatigue Failures. Robert C. Bremer, Jr., Schwitzer Engineered Components. Fatigue failures observed in a belt-driven engine cooling fan indicated the presence of significant vibration activity. A testing and analysis program was undertaken in an effort to measure the fan vibration characteristics in a vehicle environment, and relate these characteristics to some known source of excitation. The classical vibration analysis of a fan and fan pulley coupled to a crankshaft pulley by a drive belt commonly predicts the fan to be effectively isolated from crankshaft vibration. The results of this testing program, however, indicated the presence of significant torsional and linear vibration at frequencies that corresponded to crankshaft torsional vibration orders, and thus indicated a complex mechanism of energy transfer through the belt system. 1976 SA E Transactions 760843.

Unbalance, perhaps the most common cause of excessive vibration, can normally be corrected in-place. 1976 SA E Transactions 121</page><page sequence="109">760845 - 760855 760845. Modifications of Steering Axle Cam Brakes for FMVSS 121. Paul G. Marting, Wagner Electric Corp. The increased torque levels required on front axles of air brake vehicles to comply with the 60 miles per hour, 245 foot stopping distance of FMVSS 121 created brake packaging problems not only due to the brake assemblies being larger for a given axle weight, but due to the inclusion of antilock hardware and the larger front axles. To produce the additional torque, increased brake input power was needed, necessitating material and design changes of the basic foundation brake. Many of these design considerations are discussed in this paper. 760850. Analysis of Coast-Down Data to Assess Aero- dynamic Drag Reduction on Full-Scale Tractor- Trailer Trucks in Windy Environments. Frank T. Buckley, Jr., Colin H. Marks and William H. Walston, Jr., Mechanical Engineering Dept., University of Maryland. A data reduction procedure is presented and successfully used to analyze coast-down data obtained in a windy environment to provide a measure of the aerodynamic drag on a full-scale tractor-trailer combination as a function of the yaw angle of the vehicle. Full-scale drag coefficients were evaluated for a vehicle operated in the baseline mode, and following the addition of four different drag reducing combinations, over a yaw angle range of from -10° to 10°. Comparison with wind tunnel measurements suggests that the wind-tunnel provides a reasonable simulation of the effects of winds on vehicle drag. The full-scale drag reductions measured in the presence of winds were generally lower than those found in wind-tunnel tests, except in situations where a vertical gap seal device was present. In this case, there was good agreement between the results of the coast-down tests and the wind-tunnel tests. The highest drag reductions that were measured in the presence of winds were obtained with a streamlined fairing/gap seal combination, which produced a 32% drag reduction at 0° yaw, and a 21% reduction in wind-averaged drag. The drag reductions obtained with the roof fairing, with and without gap seals, significantly exceeded those obtained with a commercially available wind deflector, with and without a vortex stabilizing device. 1976 SA E Transactions 760851. Optimization Study of Liquid-to-Air Heat Ex- changer in the Cooling System of Military Combat/Tactical Vehicle. Jiunn P. Chiou, Uni- versity of Detroit. Cooling system air flow resistance characteristics are different for commercial and military combat/tactical vehicles. The optimum configurations of air-cooled heat exchangers in these vehicles are therefore different. In this paper, the unique characteristics of the cooling air flow path of military combat/tactical vehicle are presented. Optimization analysis of liquid-to-air heat exchanger considering the minimum fan power requirement as design criterion are discussed. An exchanger with smaller face area and thicker core, which was previously thought to be undesirable, is found to be favorable for some typical applications. 760853. (SP-411) Engine Developments and Agricultural Equipment Fuel Consumption Trends. Jose F. Regueiro, John Deere Product Engineering Center. Agricultural technology improvements over the last decade have resulted in substantial increases in both farm production and productivity. Most of these improvements have been possible by the widespread acceptance of the diesel engine as prime mover for agricultural machinery. Today's "super- tractors", backbone of the trend towards large farm operations, are all based on highly efficient diesel engines. The decrease in total agricultural fuel consumption over the last 20 years is the best testimony for the agricultural diesel engine. Short term improvements in engine and tractor efficiency should be based on further refinements of known techniques, with added emphasis in combustion control as well as volumetric and mechanical efficiencies. On a longer term, advanced fuel and air handling systems will allow combustion control for improved engine-vehicle matches, resulting in further improvements in the energy efficient use of farm machinery. 760854.

Utilizing extensive synthesized hydrocarbon fluid (SHF) technology, a superior quality light viscosity automotive engine oil has been developed providing optimized engine performance. This product has been shown to provide significant fuel economy benefits while maintaining excellent performance in the areas of oil economy, engine cleanliness and wear protection. In the past, this level of performance has not been possible using conventionally refined mineral oils. The superior performance of this product is docu- mented in extensive laboratory engine, chassis dyna- mometer and field tests. Particular emphasis is placed on extended duration API Sequence tests and EPA fuel economy testing. 760855. (SP-411) Optimizing Engine and Car Design for Fuel Economy and Emissions. Donald L.

Fuel economy improvements were achieved when compared to the standard vehicles and vehicles certified by EPA for the 1975 model year. Tests showed that the lean burn TFS allows these vehicles to also meet the 1975-1976 49-state emission standards without the use of exhaust gas recirculation. Further reductions of emissions are possible with the use of exhaust aftertreatment such as port liners and/or thermal reactors. 760870. Survey of Modal Vibration Test/ Analysis Tech- niques. R. W. Mustain, Space Div., Rockwell International. The results of a survey of modal vibration test/analysis techniques in the United States are presented. Summa- rized in this paper are responses to a questionnaire distributed to Dynamics engineers involved in modal testing and to members of the SAE Committee G-5 Aerospace Shock and Vibration. The survey encompassed the following modal vibration test/analysis requirements: objectives, test specimens, boundary conditions, sup- port/suspension systems, instrumentation, excitation sys- tems, modal testing/analysis excitation methodology, correlation checks, and data processing requirements. 760872. An Evaluation of Excitation and Analysis Meth- ods for Modal Testing. George A. Hamma and Strether Smith, Lockheed Palo Alto Research Lab, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc.; and Richard C. Stroud, Space Systems Div., Lock- heed Missiles and Space Co., Inc. This paper reports on the evaluation of several modal- testing procedures as applied on a modern data-acqui- sition and -analysis system. These methods include two forms of specimen excitation (sine and multifrequency) and several methods of modal characterization (analytical curvefitting, multishaker modal tuning, and hybrid tech- niques). The methods are compared, using examples, and a modal testing procedure is suggested. 1976 SAE Transactions 760873. Force Appropriation by Extended Asher's Meth- od. Paul Ibáñez, Applied Nucleonics Co., Inc. Force appropriation is used in modal vibration testing of complex structures in order to excite one mode of vibration at a time. In this paper several force appro- priation algorithms are reviewed and an extension of Asher's method, using impulsive and transient excitation as well as sinusoidal excitation, is developed. The number and location of exciter and measurement points can be different with the extended Asher's method which prom- ises to be relatively free of the false resonant frequencies that occasionally affect the standard Asher's method. 760875. Identifying Modes of Large Structures from Multiple Input and Response Measurements. Mark Richardson and Jim Kniskern, Hewlett- Packard Co. When mode shapes are identified from transfer function measurements, it is usually assumed that the structure can only be excited or its response measured at a single point. Hence, this method has become known as the "single point" testing method. This paper discusses a new testing and data processing technique for obtaining modal parameters which does not require that the transfer function measurements be made using a single excitation or response point. For large structures this "multiple point" testing technique is in many cases, necessary for obtaining measurements of sufficient quality to identify the modes of vibration. 760876. Modal Surveys of Weakly Coupled Systems. Albert L. Klosterman, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. The emergence of digital signal processing equipment and associated computer programs has caused a strong interest in modal survey investigations using this type of equip- ment. It will be shown, however, in this paper that in certain types of physical systems, mode shapes are so highly sensitive to small changes in the physical properties of the system that close agreement between computed and experimentally measured mode shapes cannot be ex- pected. It will be shown, for example, that in certain situations stiffness changes in the order of five percent give rise to changes in coupled mode shapes of the order of fifty percent. 760877. Modal Analysis with the DMS/TSA System. David J. Durham and Richard H. Russell, Zonic Technical Labs., Inc. Digital signal processing systems using the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) have increased the efficiency and power of modal analysis in solving dynamics problems. One function of these systems, the generation of animated deformation plots, provides a very useful tool for studying complex structures vibrating at resonant frequencies. The digital processing systems have automated the procedure for developing these plots and have allowed the extraction of multiple plots from a single set of data. This paper outlines the development of animated deformation plots from experimental frequency response information. Em- phasis is placed on the use of a local and time-shared analysis system (the DMS/TSA) for cost effective analysis procedures. 123</page><page sequence="111">760878-760886 760878. Survey of European Ground and Flight Vibration Test Methods. H. G. Natke, Technical Univer- sity Hannover (Germany). The ground and flight vibration test methods of the E.C. which are published and/or used in practice since 1968 are reviewed. The survey contains a short description of the methods, indications with regard to their applications and ensuing experiences, and it reflects many and successful efforts in the field of identification. Ground vibration test methods without a-priori parameter esti- mation predominate over those with parameter estima- tion. Only a few methods consider non-linearities. The flight vibration test methods are based exclusively on estimation procedures and much effort is expended to cope with background noise. 1976 SA E Transactions 760879. Comparison of Modal Test Results: Multipoint Sine Versus Single-Point Random. E. L. Leppert, S. H. Lee, F. D. Day, P. C. Chapman and B. K. Wada, Jet Propulsion Lab, California Institute of Technology. Several software packages have been developed for use with minicomputers to decrease the test schedule and cost of modal surveys. The newer development referred to as "single-point random," appears to have potential cost and schedule advantages, but evaluations of the adequacy of test results and test experience on complex structures are almost nonexistent. The tests, performed on the Mariner Jupiter/Saturn (MJS) spacecraft, provide an additional comparison of the more traditional multipoint sine dwell and the single-point random modal test methods. 760883. The Challenge for Improved Air Cargo Capa- bility. Lt. Col. J. Vaughan, NASA Military Aircraft Systems Office U.S. Air Force. The demands for large cargo airlift to the year 2000 are examined. The near and mid-term military needs require a substantial airlift improvement program. Mid-term em- phasis must be for efficient, new civil capacity that can meet military emergency needs. The size of the air cargo business appears to still dictate use of a passenger derivative aircraft in this time period- rather than a dedicated airfreighter. Military airlift commonality prob- lems of loading heavy, outsize equipment must be resolved during the new aircraft design. The far-term airlift needs are for greater worldwide capability, which requires new technology and possibly a new aircraft configuration. 760884. An Approach to a Methodology for Selection and Development of Flight/Propulsion Control Coup- ling Technologies. E. Rachovitsky, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab, Wright-Patterson AFB; R. L. Heimbold, Lockheed California Co., R. J. Miller, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group; and J. A. Hauge, Honeywell Inc. The Flight Propulsion Control Coupling (FPCC) Meth- odology is a management technique for evaluating the many available aircraft and propulsion technologies and modes of control so that development resources are expended on those that have the highest potential payoff. Beginning with mission and operational requirements for a future aircraft, the various technologies and modes of control are screened to eliminate those that obviously do not apply. Those surviving are evaluated quantitatively to determine relative merit using a criterion, such as cost effectiveness. A series of computer generated matrices is used to exercise the methodology which also serves as a basis for in-depth development planning for promising technologies. The methodology is demonstrated by means of a "walkthrough" using preliminary data and the operational requirements of a 1985 air combat aircraft. 760885. Use of a Digital Computer in an Integrated Propulsion Control System. C. M. Carlin and W. J. Hastings, Boeing Aerospace Co. A digital computer was used to control an augmented turbofan engine and its inlet on a supersonic fighter. A brief summary of the system configuration and per- formance provides the background for remarks on the development of the system. Throughout the program a free flowing interchange of ideas, design, and test data was maintained among three major contractors and three Government facilities, aiding in the integration process. Particular emphasis is placed on: The role of simulation in system development, Software development and configuration control, Adaptation of the propulsion control system to a series of test facilities. Based on the experience acquired in the successful completion of the program, conclusions relevant to future engine/airframe development are drawn - digital elec- tronic engine controls are practical and essential for the fully integrated aircraft of the future. In addition specific recommendations are made for simulation and data reduction facilities for future engine controls development programs. 760886. VLF Integrated Flight/Propulsion Control. H. H. Ostroff, McDonnell Aircraft Co. The Control Configured Vehicle, as embodied in the McDonnell Aircraft Vectored Lift Fighter, offers new dimensions in airplane responsiveness. To take full advantage of this potential to improve air combat and attack effectiveness, a degree of coupling between the airplane's flight control system and its propulsion control system was investigated. It was demonstrated in manned simulation that integrating the Vectored Lift Fighter's powerful aerodynamic deceleration control with the control of its high thrust-to-weight ratio propulsion system effectively reduced pilots' work load during critical moments in air combat and attack maneuvers when the pilots' attention must be concentrated upon acquiring and tracking the target. 124</page><page sequence="112">760887 - 760897 760887. The HiMAT RPRV Propulsion Control System. Jamal E. Bayati, Rockwell International Corp. A multimode propulsion control system concept has been developed for the remotely piloted research vehicle of the NASA Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology pro- gram. The concept is based on the retention of most of the bill-of-materials control hardware, and will allow the implementation of flight/propulsion control coupling, high and normal flow stability margin operating modes, and rapid and normal thrust response modes. Description of the control system, the airborne control components, and the ground generated and displayed signals is given in this paper. 760888. Olympus 593 - Experience in First year of Com- mercial Service. Dr. P. H. Calder OBE, Project Director Olympus 593 Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited Aero Div., Bristol, England; and J. Nock, Chief Engineer Olympus 593 Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited Aero Div., Bristol, England. This paper describes some of the work leading to the type test and certification of the world's first civil supersonic powerplant. The airlines' embodied and spare production engines average mission equivalent specific fuel con- sumption and the takeoff thrust guarantees have been met. Some problems encountered in the first nine months of passenger service are described and the conclusion is drawn that, so far, the operation has been very satis- factory when compared with the experience of many new subsonic projects at a comparable stage in their evolution. Reliability has been high and delay rates have been low. 760891. Powerplants for Future SSTs. Dr. P. H. Calder OBE, Project Director Olympus 593 Rolls- Royce (1971) Limited Aero Div., Bristol, England; and P. C. Gupta, Chief Performance Engineer Olympus 593 Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited Aero Div., Bristol, England. In further studies of Advanced Supersonic Transport (AST) powerplants the relative merits of several different engine cycles have been compared. The influence of the noise levels which have to be met is shown to be a dominant factor on the design of both the powerplant and the aircraft. An uprated turbofan derivative of the pure jet Olympus 593 Concorde engine could provide a satis- factory powerplant for a quiet and economically viable AST having improved pollution characteristics 1976 SA E Transactions 760892. Isolation of Rotor Induced Vibration with the Bell Focal Pylon-Nodal Beam System. Troy M. Gaffey and Rodney W. Balke, Bell Helicopter Textron Fort Worth, Texas. The stringent vibration requirements of the military and the desire of the civil customer for a smooth ride has led Bell to develop the NODAMATIC isolation system. The NODAMATIC system consists of a focal pylon to isolate inplane hub shears and hub moments and a nodal beam to isolate vertical hub shears. Presently this system is used on two production helicopters, the Bell Models 214 and 206L, on the Model 222 8-place commercial helicopter now in development testing, and on the U. S. Army YAH-63 Advanced Attack Helicopter. Flight tests have demon- strated that crew station and cabin vibration levels of less than .05g at blade passage frequency can be attained with the NODAMATIC system. The technical design considerations of tuning for isolation over a wide rpm range, minimization of system weight, redundancy and crashworthiness, and the influ- ence of the isolation system on rotor stability are discussed. Mechanical design requirements for the system are also discussed. Operational experience with the 214 and 206L NODAMATIC systems is reviewed. The paper concludes with a discussion of design requirements for an isolation system that could provide the helicopter with a "jet smooth" ride. 760894. Helicopter Rotor Isolation Evaluation Utilizing the Dynamic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator. Robert Jones, Kaman Aerospace Corp.; and Joseph H. McGarvey, Eustis Directorate- USAAMRDL. Helicopters characteristically exhibit large amplitude vibration at low frequencies caused by the main rotor induced shears and moments. One means of reducing this vibration level is by rotor isolation. That is, the isolation of the fuselage from rotor induced shears and moments. Under sponsorship of Eustis Directorate, USAAMRDL, Kaman Aerospace has conducted rotor isolation pro- grams utilizing the Dynamic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator (DAVI). A summary of the analytical, full scale shake test and flight test rotor isolation programs are discussed. 760896. Boundary Layer Considerations for Optimization of Acoustic Liners for Aircraft Engine Ducts. Roland A. Prydz, Lockheed-California Co. This paper presents a study of the effects of shear flow on the sound attenuation in lined ducts. The main emphasis is on proper selection of linear impedance for optimum attenuation performance of the acoustic liner in the presence of realistic duct boundary layer flows. Results are given for arbitrary spinning acoustic propagation modes, and combinations of modes in treated inlet and exhaust ducts for a variety of simple boundary layer velocity profiles and boundary layer thicknesses. It is shown that boundary layer effects are significantly reduced when all the propagating modes are combined to give total attenuation. 1976 SA E Transactions 760897.

Following a two year feasibility study the programme was launched in mid 1972 based around a standard production RB 211 engine. It is now essentially complete and the lessons learned from tests on almost 100 powerplant configurations bear witness to the problems of making inroads into further quietening similar modern engines. This paper summarises the important findings, highlights areas in which Research and Development should be concentrated and presents a judgment of future trends and implications. 760898. CONCORDE - Community Noise. J. A. Hay, British Aircraft Corp. This paper presents a brief description of the special problems encountered in devising and developing si- lencing treatments for a supersonic transport aircraft, and the extensive research and development effort involved. It outlines the methods adopted and the development programme involved in the Concorde project. In the course of this work, one of the principal lessons learnt was that static noise tests are not a reliable basis for in-flight noise prediction. The main noise flight tests of the prototype and production aircraft which demonstrated the community noise levels are summarised, and the public response to the first months of in-service operations is indicated. 760902. Recirculation Air Cycle Environmental Control System for Helicopters. L. B. Buss, AiResearch Manufacturing Company of California A Divi- sion of The Garrett Corporation. Environmental control systems for helicopters are desir- able to increase comfort, promote cooling of electronic gear, and enhance pilot effectiveness. An optimized design is important to minimize weight, power extraction, and operating costs. This paper discusses a unique type of small, lightweight air cycle environmental control unit that has been developed specifically for helicopters. In comparison to other units, it offers the advantages of a lower power penalty, lower fuel energy and maintenance requirements, and increased reliability. 760903. A New Look at High-Speed Machining. Robert I. King, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Company, Inc. The results of an industrial engineering process im- provement study is presented. The complex, high-cost, contour milling of nonferrous alloys was critically exam- ined with the result that estimated production cost reductions of 50 percent were verified. Test data also suggests additional reduction of machining costs with the proper integration of present-day machine tool technol- ogy. Typical test results are presented with some indi- cations of their future impact on product design. 1976 SA E Transactions 760908. Silencing Experience with a Large Gas Turbine. Michael W.

The Impact of Emission Standards on the Design of Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Combustors. Richard A. Rudey, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The advent of environmental standards for controlling aircraft gas turbine engine emissions has led to a réévaluation of combustor design techniques. Effective emission control techniques have been identified and a wide spectrum of potential applications for these tech- niques to existing and advanced engines are being considered. Results from advanced combustor concept evaluations and from fundamental experiments are pre- sented and discussed and comparisons are made with existing EPA emission standards and recommended levels for high altitude cruise. The impact that the advanced low emission concepts may impose on future aircraft engine combustor designs and related engine components is discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760910. Diagnostic System for Ball Bearing Quality Control. L. W. Winn, Mechanical Technology Inc.; and H. L. Bull, CCAD/NAS, U.S. Army. This paper describes the test and construction of a bearing analyzer which employs the High Frequency Resonance Technique (HFRT) for fault detection and identification. The analyzer consists of a mechanical console on which the test bearing is mounted, loaded, and brought up to speed, and an electronic console which receives bearing vibrations via an accelerometer mounted on the bearing retainer, and processes same to provide a digital unit readout indicative of bearing condition. Preliminary testing indicates that the bearing analyzer as hereby presented can distinguish between "good" and "bad" ball bearings. The results obtained on the bearing analyzer were found to be in excellent agreement with those obtained through manual inspection techniques. Further testing and evaluation, however, is necessary before the analyzer can be fully qualified as an inspection tool. Tests are presently in process at CCAD. 760913.

Hummel, Boeing Commer- cial Airplane Co. As a fleet of aircraft builds more and more experience in the real operational environment, the data flowing from that experience can contribute significantly to: (a) better forecasts of future maintenance needs and costs, (b) better focus of the inspection and maintenance efforts, (c) special new equipment/techniques to reduce costs in specific cases, (d) high confidence in continued safe operation. Several extensions of historical approaches have been developed to support the early models of the jet fleet. The general characteristics of these techniques and their potential economic contributions are discussed. 1976 SA E Transactions 760914. Principles of Computer Process Planning. Steven J. Pflederer and Wilbur S. Mann, United Technologies Research Center. An analytic framework for process planning activity has been formulated and incorporated as the basis of a generative computer process planning system. The system uses full geometric design data and produces, under interactive control, detailed operation sheets with dimen- sioned workpiece drawings. The major elements of the system technology are process decision models, machining analysis and optimization models, a special process planning language, and man-machine communication by interactive graphics. 760916. An Analytical Study of the Effects of Turbine Variable Geometry Operation on Turbine Blade Cooling Requirements for Fixed Match Point Turbojet Application. D. A. Nealy and H. G. Lueders, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. An assessment of the fundamental design and operational variables which influence the choice and performance of turbine blade cooling systems is made. The relative impact of turbine aerodynamic design, cooling system design, and operating regime on cooling flow requirements is inves- tigated, and the important variables influencing off design cooling performance are reviewed. The study shows that in addition to the obvious influence of gas stream and coolant temperature level, cooling requirements are strongly dependent on aero- dynamic design. Furthermore, off design performance requirements can significantly influence the choice of the cooling system as well as the cooling system design/sizing point. 1976 SA E Transactions 760917. Summary of NASA Aerodynamic and Heat Transfer Studies in Turbine Vanes and Blades. Thomas P. Moffitt, Francis S. Stępka and Harold E. Rohlik, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Aerodynamic effects of trailing edge geometry, hole size, angle, spacing, and shape have been studied in two- and three-dimensional cascades and in a warm turbine test series. Heat transfer studies have been carried out in various two- and three-dimensional test facilities in order to provide corresponding heat transfer data. Results are shown in terms of cooling effectiveness and aerodynamic efficiency for various coolant fractions, coolant-primary temperature ratios, and cooling configurations. 1976 SA E Transactions 760918. Cyclic Structural Analyses of Air-Cooled Gas Turbine Blades and Vanes. Albert Kaufman and Raymond E. Gaugler, NASA Lewis Research Center. The creep-fatigue behavior of a fully impingement-cooled blade for four cyclic cases was analyzed by using the Elas 55, finite-element, nonlinear structural computer program. Expected cyclic lives were calculated by using the method of Strainrange Partitioning for reversed inelastic strains and time fractions for ratcheted tensile creep strains. Strainrange Partitioning was also applied to previous results from a one-dimensional cyclic analysis of a film-impingement-cooled vane. The analyses indicated that Strainrange Partitioning is more applicable to a constrained airfoil such as the film-impingement-cooled vane than to the relatively unconstrained fully impinge- ment-cooled airfoil. 1976 SA E Transactions 760919. Fuel Additives to Inhibit Sulfidation. M. A. Decrescente and N. S. Bornstein, United Tech- nologies Research Center; and C. A. M. Bliz- zard, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft of Canada. Sulfidation attack, the accelerated oxidation of gas turbine components, occur when the surfaces are covered with a fused alkali salt. Oxide ions present in the melt, react with and render the normally protective oxide scale ineffectual allowing the salt to oxidize the substrate. Turbogard™, a chromium containing fuel additive, attenuates sulfidation corrosion. Turbogard reacts with and alters the oxide ion content of the corrosive melt. Even in the presence of corrosive lead deposits, hot corrosion attenuation was observed. 760920. The Development and Flight Testing of the XC-8A Air Cushion Landing System (ACLS). David J.

Modern technology has been applied to derivation of a viable open-ocean seaplane design capable of operation from, and sea sitting in, sea state 5. Beginning with a delineation of traditional seaplane limitations and phil- osophically unencumbered by orthodoxy, the design features a blended catamaran-fuselage hull, hydrofoil, high wing, twin boom, and Vee tail with top-mounted engines. Weighing 1.25 million pounds including weapons and avionics suite, the design has been applied to a Sea Control mission. Consideration has been given to con- cepts for inhibition of motion sickness. 760925. The Use of Vortex Generators as Inexpensive Compressor Casing Treatment. C. Herbert Law, Arthur J. Wennerstrom and William A. Buzzell, Turbine Engine Div., Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab, Wright-Patterson AFB. This paper describes an inexpensive form of casing treatment which was found to increase both efficiency and stall margin in an axial compressor stage and which could be easily and cheaply retrofitted to existing engines. The method consists of placement of a row of vortex generators on the outer casing of an axial compressor, upstream of the rotor. Design techniques are described. An experimental investigation is also described in which vortex generator tip treatment was applied to a single stage axial compressor. Gains in compressor efficiency and stall margin were observed. 760926. Air Force Facility for Large Turbine Engine Compressor Testing. J. N. Untz, The Cadre Corp.; M. A. Stibich and G. T.

Design and Test of an Experimental Rotating Diffuser Centrifugal Compressor Test Rig. C. Rodgers, Solar Div., International Harvester Co. The mechanical and performance test evaluation of an experimental high pressure ratio single-stage centrifugal compressor incorporating a rotating vaneless-vaned dif- fuser is discussed. The test rig employed was a turbo-drive configuration with the centrifugal impeller driven by a directly-coupled air turbine. The rotating diffuser was supported on a separate shaft operating at approximately 25% impeller speed and directly coupled to a high-speed water brake. Mechanical operation of the compressor rig was satisfactory. Best overall test performance achieved at design speed was a total-total pressure ratio of 7.7 with an adiabatic efficiency of 72.3% (average stage exit Mach number of 0.27). A broad flow range ratio of 1.25 between choke and surge was obtained with the diffuser rotating at design speed. 760928. Technology Outlook for Aviation. Leonard Roberts, NASA Ames Research Center. In the past thirty years, the growth of aviation has resulted in substantial benefits being brought to industrial nations of the world and especially to the United States. As a leader in aviation development, the United States has benefited from its research and development in- vestments in terms of greater productivity, improved air transportation, as well as favorable contributions to its balance of trade. In the future, it is expected that air transportation will be important in shaping urban development and stimu- lating national and international commerce. In addition, the possibility exists that new uses for aircraft may add additional impetus to aviation development. 760929. Airframe Technology for Energy Efficient Trans- port Aircraft. Robert W. Leonard and Richard D. Wagner, NASA Langley Research Center. Fuel costs comprise a major portion of air transport operating costs. Thus, energy efficiency is an essential design goal for future transport aircraft. Advanced composite structures, advanced wing geometries, and active control systems all promise substantial benefits in fuel efficiency and direct operating cost for derivative and new aircraft introduced by 1985. Technology for main- tenance of a laminar boundary layer in cruise offers great benefits in fuel efficiency and direct operating cost and may be ready for application to transports introduced in the 1990's. NASA and the air transport industry are cooperating in a comprehensive Aircraft Energy Effi- ciency Program to expedite the introduction of these advanced technologies into production aircraft. 1976 SA E Transactions 760930. Flight Displays for the Next Generation Aircraft. Robert Dunn, Chief Engineer, Systems Tech- nology Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company. The influence of the increasing complexity of the commercial transport operating environment is cited as the reason for applying advanced display technology to new aircraft design. Principal factors are the fuel crisis, sensitivity of the environmental noise, and the need for increased traffic capacity. Industry-wide development programs for fully configured flight decks, as well as specific subsystems, are reviewed. 1976 SA E Transactions 128</page><page sequence="116">760931 -760937 760931.

In view of the fact that future generations of derivative or new aircraft will be faced with problems of increasing operating efficiency, new and more advanced technology will have to be introduced. To this end, the Federal Aviation Administration has been examining the certi- fication question and has concluded that simulation may be increasingly important in the future certification activities. Through a contract with Lockheed Aircraft Company, the FAA will be able to review past use of industrial simulation in connection with certification. 760932. YJ101/YF-17 Flight Test Experience. G. C. Rapp, General Electric Co., J. F. Montgomery, Wright- Patterson AFB; and G. G. Lail, General Electric Co. The new approach used for the YJ101 development program has produced achievements which are applicable to future engine programs. A description is presented of the YJ101 engine as well as the unique development program leading to flight qualification. Two specific achievements are reviewed; first, the inlet-engine com- patibility, and second, engine life evaluation. The inlet compatibility program established specific steps to be followed to achieve stall-free engine operation. The objectives of each step are reviewed. Realistic engine development testing is recognized as a key requirement for the engine industry. Correlation of factory testing with service usage is important to the development of a methodology for engine testing. An analysis of the actual YF-17 engine operation is made and compared to factory development testing. Further devel- opment of these concepts is required. 1976 SA E Transactions 760933. Procedures Used In Flight Tests of an Integrated Propulsion Control System on an F-111E Air- plane. Jennifer L. Baer, Jon K. Holzman and Frank W. Burcham, Jr., NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. A digital integrated propulsion control system (IPCS) was tested on an F-111E airplane. The IPCS provided full authority control of the left inlet and the TF30 after- burning engine. Supersonic test conditions were of primary interest. The operational procedures and maneu- vers developed for IPCS evaluation, displays for test monitoring and data acquisition, flight safety, and problems encountered are discussed. The software re- finements that made modifications to standard flight test procedures necessary are described. The flexibility of digital control and the ways software was used to overcome hardware deficiencies are discussed. Applica- tion of these procedures to a typical IPCS flight is described. 760934. T700 Engine Flight Test Experience on UTTAS and A AH. Charles H. Greene, Aerospace En- gineer AAH Project Manager's Office U.S. Army DARCOM; George J. Kovacích, Chief, Propulsion Branch UTTAS Project Manager's Office U.S. Army DARCOM; and W. J. Craw- ford III, General Manager, Turboshaft/Tur- boprop Engine Department General Electric Company. A helicopter development "first" was pioneered by a joint U.S. Army/GE team by simultaneously developing a new turboshaft engine and four different experimental heli- copters. The four aircraft were involved in two major flyoff competitions, UTTAS and AAH. Both the UTTAS and AAH competitive programs are reviewed, including Army aircraft development objectives and associated engine performance, reliability, and main- tainability goals. T700-GE-700 engine development his- tory is traced from the early origins of UTTAS planning to the current pre-production maturity test program. A key factor in successfully integrating a single engine configuration into four helicopters is a thorough, pre-field test propulsion system integration effort: factory engine environmental and "fleet leader" testing; repeated Army/GE/ A VM design and test reviews; and factory performance and vibrational testing for each installation. Engine reliability data and installation "lessons learned" from the 18,000 engine test hours accumulated during the UTTAS and AAH Programs are also sum- marized. 1976 SA E Transactions 760935. The Impact of Effectiveness Considerations On Design Synthesis. A. J. Roch and F. K. Ladner, Vought Corp. The scope of recent aircraft preliminary design studies has been expanded to include effectiveness considerations for configuration justification. Today's designer must there- fore examine not only the interactions between traditional aircraft parameters (e.g. wing planform variables, engine cycle variables); he must determine how those parameters impact mission requirements. He must deal with more variables and new resource criteria. Statistical experiments and numerical search techniques are required to perform the optimization process, and combat effectiveness be- comes the selection criteria. This report summarizes how optimization techniques and a campaign force effec- tiveness model have been incorporated into Vought's Aircraft Synthesis Analysis Program (ASAP) to perform these studies. 760937.

Benefits among engineer- ing groups and to downstream users of computer-stored geometry definitions are also discussed. 760941. Computerized Engine Test Systems for Per- formance Evaluation. Robert J. Boozang and James P. Fentress, Hamilton Test Systems, Inc. A new engine development test system recently completed at one of the "Big 3" automobile companies handles performance testing in which horsepower, torque, me- chanical efficiency and other engine design parameters are computer acquired. The configuration allows one proc- essor and its interfaces to automatically control four independent test cells concurrently. Dynamometer ref- erence speed, engine throttle position, spark advance and fuel rate are computer controlled, utilizing feedback to close the control loops. Optimization techniques are applied via Fortran algorithms to perform actuator control, achieving set point repeatability. 130</page></plain_text>
