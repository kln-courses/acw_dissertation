<plain_text><page sequence="1">LA VIE DES ABEILLES SOLITAIRES. Histoires Naturel- les-9. By Robert Hardouin; edited by Jean Rostand. Gallimard, Paris. 370 fr. (paper). 269 pp. + 8 plates; text ill. 1948. The author of this handy volume is an archeologist and painter specializing in the Roman ruins of the Provence, where Fabre, his "dear demi-God," studied insects before him. "Cerceris comes and goes among the Roman steles; Scolia hums under a portico. From ruin to ruin I have descended the valley of the Rhone... where the architectural genius of the power- ful Romans gave place to the winged hordes which also work in cement." The 268 pages of the book represent the work of 30 years. In the text 150 spe- cies are cited; personal observations have been made of many of these, though it is difficult for the reader to determine which facts were ascertained at first hand, and which have been filled in from other authors. The facts of meloid life history and the intricacies of stylopization are, perforce, taken from the literature. Frank quotations, of course, abound for the sake of filling in life histories. The book begins with a chapter on correlation of structure and function. Throughout the book much attention is given to the bees' mandibles, an attempt being made to correlate their shape and sculpturing with the "profession" of the species, whether "paper- hanger" (leaf cutter), mason, wool-carder, mattress- maker, resin-worker, carpenter, or digger. The cor- relation does not work out strictly, since some species follow two professions, the same mandibles sufficing for work with two very different materials: plant pubescence, and mud or rosin, for example. The author was successful in attracting many bees to his "apiary," which consisted of a box holding in- numerable bamboo and glass tubes; but the text is not clear just what he learned from these, perhaps because he wished the story to swing along smoothly as indeed it does. There are full accounts of parasites appended to each chapter; and, so far as the reviewer knows, the author has surpassed all other writers on solitary bees in his list of flowers preferred by each species-which gives more occasion for the lyricism of the writing. There is, however, a very practical chapter on the ecological value of the bees. An important feature of the book is the author's constant emphasis on the adaptability of all individuals, the "elasticity" and "plasticity" of behavior, and the variability of habits within each species. In this he takes sharp issue with the hero of his youth, Jean Fabre, as did the Peckhams, as well as the reviewer, nearly fifty years ago. But the author frequently relinquishes a desirable objectivity by his simple as- sumption of "intelligent" behavior on the part of the bees. Like Fabre, Hardouin goes into ecstacy about the wonderful time he is having in seeing the secrets of his microcosm unfold themselves as he observes, and he succumbs to the usual anthropomorphism at the slightest provocation, for his bee heroines readily be- come people. His brilliant Megachile, for example, chooses a tube already hollowed out in order "to save time," for she "realizes" that she must finish her tasks before autumn and death overtake her. However, before the end of the season many of his "friends" go berserk, behaving most erratically: "After such acts my disappointment is as great as my admiration had previously been high." We may, however, charitably accept such passages as designed to impart a literary flavor to the book. The problem of sex control has interested this author like so many before him. Osmia lays a "female" egg in the large cell which is provisioned with 800 mg. of bee-bread, but a male egg on a 400 mg. mass in a small cell. If one interchanges the eggs, one raises a diminu- tive female and a large male, which proves that sex is determined at oviposition. In Anthidium the male</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 47 is much the larger, although in other species there is no sexual dimorphism. The author's "Where? How? Why?" of sex control he does not answer. For the evolutionist the author points out species which are transitional in both morphology and habits, and he philosophizes as to the origin of inquilines from "productive" species; but, as with other basic problems, he ends with generalities. The numerous illustrations by the author are excellent. A translation into English should prove useful. CAR.L HARTmAN</page></plain_text>
