Brunswick.</page><page sequence="6">Introduction After crossing a fertile undulating plain bathed by the gentle meanders of the Oker, one comes to Brunswick, a thriving middle-sized German city of Lower Saxony (see Map). Although today essentially defined by functional modern ar chitecture, Brunswick's center still focuses on the old Medieval Burgplatz (Figure 1), dominated by the Cathedral of St. Blaise. This venerable edifice, with its steep walls flanked by massive octagonal towers, was for the greater part erected in the twenty years spanning 1173-1194. After crossing its threshold and pro ceeding towards the stage-like raised apse (Figure 2), one is awed first by the loftiness of the nave and then by the chromatically harmonious late Romanesque mural paintings depicting scenes from the Testaments, the Finding of the True Cross, and events from the lives of SS. John the Baptist, Blaise, and Thomas of Canterbury, who have stood as protectors of the church since the early thirteenth century. At the chancel and visible from all main vantage points are the tombs of the founder, Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, and his consort, Matilda Plantagenet, marked by noteworthy limestone effigies (Figure 3). The duke is not represented either with his hands crossed or lying at his side- traditional gestures of eternal repose- but rather holding a model of the church, evidence of his largess, and grasping a sword, symbol of his rank and implication of his knightly valor. Duke Henry, an eminent figure in German Medieval times, was bestowed the epithet of "Lion" as much on account of his aloof and ambitious politics as for the bravery he displayed on the field. In addition to being a striking embodiment of the Medieval German prince, Duke Henry was also a major patron of the arts. He made Brunswick his capital and in 1166 erected there in front of his castle of Dankwarderode, flanked by the Burg kirche of St. Blaise, a mighty, over life-size bronze lion (Figure 4), the heraldic symbol of his family and a fitting image of his relentless rule. The name Guelph (of Welf in German) - that of the family of which Henry the Lion is the most illustrious figure- is often cited by students of Medieval history, as it has also come to stand for the political faction siding with the papacy in the age-long conflict between church and state, and opposing the Ghibellines, backers of the Holy Roman emperors. The House of Guelph, along with its predecessor the Brunon and followed by its heir, the House of Brunswick-Liineburg, made a long series of gifts to the Treasury of the Cathedral of St. Blaise which came to be known in Germany as the Welfenschatz, or Guelph Treasure. This remarkable hoard was to comprise liturgical and devotional implements, nearly all dating from the Ottonian, Romanesque, and Gothic periods. In 1482, the year of its first known inven Figure 3.

Most of the 85 pieces still extant in the twentieth century were dispersed in the 1930s between a number of public and private collections in Europe and in the United States, while a few were lost. The Guelph Treasure, as we know it today, includes truly re markable objects of sacral arts: crosses, portable altars, reli quaries, pyxes, and manuscripts, often dazzling for the shim mer of their gold and silver surfaces and the magic glow of their variegated gems and enamels. Culturally, it is an outstanding expression of spiritual values and has paramount importance for the German art of the Middle Ages. This collection equalled only by the ecclesiastical treasures of Aachen, Hildes heim, and Trier - is also unique for the number of its objects whose production can be specifically localized in Saxony. Apart from a catalogue published in 1930 and long out of print, no study devoted to the Guelph Treasure has yet been available in English.2 The present publication, therefore, has a twofold pur pose: to examine the formation of the Treasure and to reappraise its artistic significance by highlighting some of its most impor tant pieces, particularly those in The Cleveland Museum of Art.

CMA 31.462</page><page sequence="12">CHAPTER I Dawn of German Art: Images of Salvation and Power The early Medieval period is an unequivocal milestone in the history of German art. The vast expanse of the Holy Roman Empire could boast of many artistic centers, each often with its own distinctive speciality ranging from goldsmith work and enameling to monumental bronze sculpture, and from book illumination to mural painting. Among all other arts, that of the metalsmith had a particularly well-rooted tradition. Even before the advent of Charlemagne, these craftsmen excelled in making buckles and brooches, weapons and horse trappings with rich abstract designs. Enameling had been successfully practiced for centuries by the tribes north of the Rhine. As early as the second century the Greek philosopher Philostratus de scribed the glass designs, as hard as stone, produced by the Bar barians on heated bronze.3 Earliest in date among extant objects in the Guelph Treasure is a late eighth-century enamel (Color Plate Iv) known as the Cumberland Medallion, now in Cleveland.4 Originally perhaps a sacerdotal brooch, it is one of the finest as well as the largest German objects of its kind known from this period. In orna mental forms suited to the technique of cloisonne enamel - in which colored glass particles are fused by firing into separate cells formed by strips of metal (here a gold alloy) usually welded to a copper base - its represents a human figure in bust length identifiable as Christ. In a nearly cubistic abstraction, the Re deemer is shown outlined against a cruciform halo behind the rainbow of the Covenant, his two large claw-like hands hold ing the sacred book of his teachings. Looming above the figure are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet clearly associated with Christ, who in St. John's words said, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end" (Apocalypse 1:8). The immemorial implication conjured up by these letters is emphasized by the two roaring lions with their flame-like tongues, symbols of the Resurrection since according to ancient lore newborn cubs lie dead for three days until their father brings them to life by breathing in their faces. Although the enamel of the medallion is damaged, it nonetheless still imparts a vivid coloristic effect with opaque white flesh tones, turquoise and wine red for the mantle, and sapphire blue for the binding of the book. This extraordinary representation suggests the power of magic. Its highly conceptual style is based on the earlier strik ing decorative abstractions developed at the great monasteries of Monkwearsmouth, Jarrow, and Lindisfarne within the Hiberno-Saxon culture of the Kingdom of Northumbria, to day's northern England. These ornamental forms were carried in books and liturgical implements by missionaries such as St. Willibrord, who left a famous volume of gospels (Figure 5) to W Figure 5.

Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, lat. 9389, folio 18v. the abbey he founded in the early eighth century at Echternach, near Luxemburg. Although the geographical origin of the Cumberland Medallion cannot be pinpointed readily, its bold technique and general style with rhythmic contours and broad areas of enamel ing can be associated with a series of roundels with christological figures in Darmstadt (Figure 6) and with a rare representation of the Virgin (Figure 7) incorporated in the tenth-century bind ing of the Gospels of St. Gozelin, which are traditionally asso 13</page><page sequence="13">Figure 6.

II B13. ciated with the Weserraum, that region of today's West Ger many which extends from the Rhine at the point where the Mo selle becomes its tributary, north to the Baltic Sea. The metal smiths of this area had evidently seen some late antique or early Byzantine models which would have been particularly accessi ble in such city-settlements as Trier and Mainz which traced their origin to the Romans and which were subsequently drawn to the culture of the Eastern Empire. If, in the German realm, this abstract and often zoomorphic style had its first impact in the Weserraum, it soon traveled, with unabated impetus, south and east along the Rhine to the Lake of Constance, and followed the course of the Danube in Austria. The silver Altheus Reliquary with its paired enamel saints (Figure 8) exemplifies the Alemannic, or South German, adap tation of this style, while the Tassilo Chalice (Figure 9), perhaps, from Salzburg, with its more naturalistically rendered medallion of Christ, represents a significant example from Austria.5 The charming, bellowing lions of the CumberlandMedallion (Color Plate IV) seem to be distinctly echoed in the playful German cloisonne enamel symbol of St. Mark inset in the right arm of a late tenth-century Anglo-Saxon cross (Figure 10). This suggests that goldsmiths from the Weserraum, who had taken the inspiration for their forms from insular art, in turn, were highly admired for their works on English soil.6 Such objects therefore are clues, not to large historical swells, but to the con _ stant undertow influencing tides of art in the early Medieval period. In the wake of Charlemagne and his sons, who strove to re create Roman culture north of the Alps, the Ottonian emperors, far less oriented to a cultural renovatio, embarked on the con struction of often vast religious edifices.

Furnishing these new structures with rich and often osten tatious cult implements for the ministerium (liturgy) was but another part of their endowments. The imperial title was now elective rather than hereditary, and it was the wish of each new ruler, in order to distance himself from his peers asprimus in terpares, to see a priest-king role, substantiated by divine will, as part of his exalted position (Figure 11). Even if the prince F_ should govern reprehensively, Christ's words as they are spoken in the gospels had for him, more than in the case of common mortals, a manifest promise of redemption. The rich evangelistary which many a ruler commissioned as a very per sonalized object, adorned with miniatures in which his digni ty was clearly upheld, were bound in glistening covers evoking godly visions.

CMA 51.445 tistic standards it had developed and codified. The West con sciously modeled some of its buildings on the finest examples of Byzantine architecture. The central plan church built by Charlemagne at Aachen, for example, is clearly inspired by San Vitale at Ravenna, a city which had been under the rule of the Eastern Empire between the sixth and eighth centuries. The West also eagerly turned to the art of Constantinople for iconograph ic models and the fine craftsmanship of goldsmith work, bronze casting, and sumptuous fabrics. In Germany, Byzantine ob jects were in fact shrouded with an aura inseparable from their source. Such is the case, for example, of a small Byzantine pen dant of greenish steatite with a relief of the Virgin and Child (Figure 14), formerly in the Treasury of Aachen and now in Cleveland. Though stylistically it cannot be dated earlier than the tenth century, it nonetheless was held to have been worn by Charlemagne and found on the emperor when, according to tradition, Otto III in the year 1000 opened the tomb and discovered the body of his great predecessor sitting upright on a throne, wearing the crown, and holding the scepter. Such a vital insignia as the coronation mantle in the Holy Roman Em pire was traditionally made out of Byzantine brocades. When Otto II married Theophanu (Figure 11), daughter of the Eastern emperor, Romanus II, on 14 April 972, the bride ar rived in Germany bearing costly Byzantine gifts which then served as models in such places as Trier, Echternach, and Regensburg especially during the decades preceding the begin ning of the second millennium.8 In the Imperial West the rulers were not alone in promoting artistic activity. Bishops, who not infrequently were the younger sons of princes and other lords, often commanded substantial wealth in addition to spiritual authority. In turn, they plainly realized that building new churches and commissioning illumi nated codices and liturgical objects in bronze and precious metals could reap spiritual and material advantages for them personally as well as glory for their see. The high clergy did in fact exercise a clearly felt normative influence on artistic developments of this period. Archbishop Egbert of Thier (Figure 16), Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim (Figure 80), and abbesses such as Matilda (Figure 37), granddaughter of Otto I, and Theophanu at Essen (Figure 47), were among the many prom inent ecclesiastic German patrons of this time. Abbots and bishops of the period also frequently aspired to present to their contemporaries the image of great learning and of divine inspiration. Indicative of the high esteem in which metalsmithing, as well as painting on manuscripts, was held are the claims by many an ecclesiastic of practicing these arts 20</page><page sequence="20">Figure 15. Bronze Doors from St. Michael's of Hildesheim. H. 188-1/2 inches (472 cm.), W. (of each door) 44-1/16 inches (112 cm.). Germany, Lower Saxony, Hildesheim, 1015. Hildesheim, Cathedral. and the laudatory comments of followers seeking the attribu tion of these abilities to their mentors. Skill was held as a gift of God, a vestige of those qualities which man possessed in full measure before the Fall and which he could now use to reflect something of his essential purpose - the praise of God. Art was not merely seen as making a work of beauty but also as an act of piety capable of strengthening the faith of the beholder. The archetypical model bishop-goldsmith was St. Eligius, who in the seventh century not only produced saddles and similar works in gold with gems for the Frankish kings Lothar and Dagobert, but expended much of his abilities as well at fashioning many precious reliquaries to glorify the church and its saints. Among examples of putative artistic prelates of Ottonian times is St. Bernward of Hildesheim, who is credited with making large bronze objects (Figure 15), goldsmith works, and miniatures (Figure 80) in books. The zeal of ecclesiastics for smithery is clearly expressed in the writings of about 1100 by a monk of the Benedictine Abbey of Helmarshausen: I Henceforth be fired with greater ingenuity: with all the striving of your mind hasten to complete whatever is still lacking in the house of the Lord and without which the ; divine mysteries and the administering of the offices can not continue. These are chalices, candlesticks, censers, cruets, ewers, caskets for holy relics, crosses, missal covers, and all the other things that practical necessity requires for use in ecclesiastical ceremony.9 Gerbert of Reims, the greatest scholar of his time who was crowned pope in 999 as Sylvester II, writing to Archbishop Eg bert to request from the famed Trier workshop goldsmith works for his archbishop - from "the brother to the brother" - stated that these would "delight the eyes and the mind by the beauty of [their] form." "Your great and famous ingenium [genius]," Gerbert continued, after some digressions, "may ennoble our _ poor material by the addition of vitrium [glass] as well as pleas ing artistic compositions," referring to the enameling for which Trier, among all other German centers, was so famed in the late tenth century. 10 Whether or not Egbert did design goldsmith works is a moot point. That he was a great art patron, though, is clearly evident and is emphasized, for example, in a miniature (Figure 16) from his own book of pericopes - selected passages from the scriptures. An eleventh-century Guelph Treasure piece of particular relevance here, since it was both an implement of the sacerdo tumrn -that is, the liturgy- and an article of the ornamenturn, is a large ivory plaque (see Figure 17 and Back Cover), princi- , pal ornament on the binding of a precious gospel book. In the 21</page><page sequence="21">Figure 17. Miracle at Cana. Ivory plaque, 7 x 5-1/2 inches (17.8 x 14.3 cm.). Circle of Master of the Registrum Gregorii, Lotharingia(?), Liege(?), ca. 1020.

In the upper scene Mary meets her son as he approaches the house and informs him of their host's plight: the supply of wine for the wedding celebration has run low. The anxious bride and bridegroom, cup in hand, peer apprehen sively from the table toward the incoming guests to whom, they fear, they will not be able to extend the proper hospitality. On the lower register, Christ, after having directed the attendant to fill the six empty amphoras with water, speaks to his mother as the miracle takes place to the surprised delight of the bride who looks over the Virgin's shoulder. The narrative is vividly underscored by the cadenced movements of the large gestur ing hands of the tall figures. The spindly architecture rests precariously on twisting columns, draped with slung curtains, which plunge into or rest without inhibition on the sacred vessels, while the solidly rendered water gushes into them from the jugs in tight, sinuous swirls. Apparent here is the expres sionistic intent of the carver, also conveyed by the exaggerated facial features characteristic of his style: the staring effects of eyes caused by small drill holes in the pupils, the slight downturn of the mouths, and the full lower lips over protruding chins. Particularly distinctive as well are the irregular large w-shapes engraved on the gown of the Virgin, in the scene where she is depicted greeting her son, and on the pallium of Christ when he is shown balanced on the wine amphoras. Could these be workshop marks? The Cleveland ivory is a creative, late Ottonian reinterpreta tion of a Carolingian ivory plaque (Figure 18) carved in Metz around 875 after Reims models. Compared to the rhythmic and spatially integrated composition of the Carolingian prototype, the emphasis in the Cleveland ivory is on the carefully studied, nervous surface relationships between figures in the partitioned areas. In the Ottonian period, it was customary for self-respecting members of the high clergy, as well as princes, to have one or two ivory plaques set within the binding of their gospel book. This was apparently almost a rule of fashion. The British Mu seum plaque, for example, was once inset in the cover of a gos pel book now in Darmstadt.

Florence, Museo nazionale, Carrand Coill., no. 36. of Corbie in northern France) - was deduced by Adolph Gold schmidt in his monumental census of Medieval ivories to have once been part of this binding. Goldschmidt's matching of the plaque with this bookcover, however, in our view remains hy pothetical, the closeness of the dimensions perhaps being a hap penstance in a world in which the majority of the covers and their plaques have been disjoined. 12 Ivory was a highly precious material, and yet in Ottonian times one does not have the impression that it was carved in specialized central workshops, but rather by fairly diverse groups of artists. Most of the time, therefore, little can readily be pinpointed stylistically except in terms of iconographic models. Carvers and patrons fairly consistently seem to have shared a common point of attraction: models of the Carolingian period which was seen as a golden age, culturally as well as po litically. Some evidence exists to indicate that ivory carvers were i first predominantly active in Trier and Fulda, and then in Liege; I as the years passed, they were also to be found in Cologne, Minden, and other bishoprics. Goldschmidt in broad terms pro posed atenth-eleventh century dating and a Meuse Valley origin for the Cleveland Miracle at Cana. Although these positions need not be challenged fundamentally, they can be somewhat refined. Directly bound to the Cleveland ivory is a plaque of The Marys at theHoly Sepulchre (Figure 20) that, despite differences in figure scale, bears many similarities in the handling of features and other morphological details, and is also engraved with those .. curious w-marks. Another plaque, representing the Crucifix- - ion in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is characterized by many of the same traits, although here the carving is freer with figures not quite as tightly drawn. 13 The nervous aesthetics of the style of these plaques seem to be distinctively Ottonian and cannot be related in any clear manner to what is commonly held to be Mosan classicism. Ivories of the Meuse Valley of the tenth and eleventh centuries are actually those produced in Liege for the wealthy and independent prince-bishops. From all we can deduce, the first carvers active in that city came from Metz, Figure 21.

Both cities belonged to that vast region known as Lotharingia which was considerably larger than the French Lorraine of later times, including present-day Holland, Belgium, and much of the Western Rhineland. By the end of the millennium, Liege seems to have welcomed artists from other centers as well. One of them was the Master of the Registrum Gregorii, a book painter so named for a famous man uscript (Figure 21) he illuminated in Trier before his workshop was disbanded at the death of Archbishop Egbert in 993. The latter had fostered the activity in his see of several important artistic workshops, but they failed to find support from his suc cessor, Liudolf. 4 One work attributed to the Master of the Re gistrum Gregorii, who also carved ivory, is the Crucifixion plaque (Figure 22) in the Church of Our Lady in Tongeren.

The elongated figures, with their flatly rendered drapery, nervous gestures, worried expressions, and drilled eyes, are echoed in a very related manner in the Miracle at Cana composition in the Cleveland Museum (Figure 17). This might suggest that the latter may either have been carved in the immediate circle of the Master of the Registrum Gregorii in Liege or else perhaps in another center, but always one reflecting the Ther-Echternach tendencies with their strong Byzantine influence due in great part to the court's - particularly Empress Theophanu's - pa tronage. If not in Liege or Trier, the Cleveland ivory might perhaps have been produced even much farther north, in Minden, for example, since the plaques (Figure 23) which Sige bert, the local bishop, commissioned about 1030 are also carv ed in a style rooted in the Trier-Echternach workshops. 5 Despite a disparity of scale and medium, the schematized makeshift architectural backgrounds of the Cleveland Miracle at Cana and the vivacity of the narrative with expressively ren dered figures bear a not negligible relationship of style with the scenes on the monumental bronzes doors (Figures 15, 24-25) of Hildesheim, cast between 1007 and 1015. This affinity, first pointed out by Peter Lasko,'6 in our view, however, does not shed any direct light on the relationship between the ivory plaque and the doors but rather suggests a common source which we consider to be the Trier workshops of Archbishop Egbert. It is conceivable though that the Cleveland plaque might have been acquired or commissioned by Bernward or his successor Gode hard. In Hildesheim the scene of the Miracle at Cana would have had a particularly relevant iconographic meaning. Abbot Bernward, probably in the course of the years 1001-02,. had received from Otto II one of the amphoras that purportedly contained the miraculous wine. Bernward had the porphyry vase, suspended at the center of a large circular chandelier, called a corona, made for his abbey of St. Michael. A fragment of this urn (Figure 26) is still in the Treasury of Hildesheim's cathedral. 17 28</page><page sequence="28">CHAPTER II Commissions and Acquistions of the Brunons in Eleventh-Century Brunswick Saxony is the name of the territory where the Saxon tribe once roamed. During the course of the centuries and endless political upheavals, its boundaries have shifted considerably. Before 1180, it corresponded by and large to the region (see Map) now known as Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) in the German Federal Republic. In 843 this expanse of sprawling verdant hills had become part of the East Frankish or German Kingdom. By the early tenth century it had emerged as a hereditary duchy, and in 919 it rose to predominance when Duke Henry of Saxony, founder of the Ottonian dynasty, was elected German king. The territory of the future Brunswick, which eventually evolved into an earldom, was a fief of the Duchy of Saxony. It is reported in ancient chronicles that the site was chosen in 861 by two brothers, Bruno and Dankward (Figure 27). While Bruno pro vided dynastic heirs, his sibling was responsible for building the first castle, the eventual Dankwarderode, or "place of Dankward." The community which in due course sprang up was named Brunswick from "Brunos Wick," or Bruno's village. This account, mingling fact and legend, provided local rulers with an historical framework loosely paralleling the founding of Rome by two brothers. In the early eleventh century the earldom of Brunswick was ruled by the ambitious Liudolf, who not only used his sword to extend his power and wealth but also exercised diplomacy to negotiate alliances. He secured an advantageous union with Gertrude, the daughter of the powerful count of Holland, Dirk III, and daughter-in-law of Gisela, the duchess of Swabia and wife of Emperor Conrad II. Gertrude, from all indications, brought refinement and new standards to the Brunons. At her instigation, improvements were first undertaken in the old castle. Then Liudolf and Gertrude founded a collegiate church on the adjacent ground. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary and SS. John the Baptist, Peter, and Paul, this structure was strictly meant as a family foundation and was primarily designed as sepulchral ground for the Brunons. It was consecrated in 1030 by Bishop Godehard of Hildesheim, the nearest episcopal see. Liudolf died in 1038, and he had the honor of the first tomb. By 1050the col legiate chapter composed of some six clerics was filled, its main duty being to pray on the grave. When Countess Gertrude died twenty-seven years later, she too was buried in the church as the surviving lead fragment of her epitaph (Figure 28) attests.18 Though probably not possessing unlimited means, Gertrude knew that in order to bring honor to their benefactors founda tions should be endowed with sacred relics enshrined in goldsmith work. With the most discerning taste, the countess commissioned three or perhaps even four pieces of the future siY1 Figure 27. Bruno and Dankward, Founders of Brunswick in 861.

Guelph Treasure: two crosses (Color Plates I-III) and a portable altar (Color Plates v-Ix), now in Cleveland, and perhaps also the reliquary shaped as an arm (Figures 29-31) in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum in Brunswick. Ten years before Gertrude's death, the heir to the earldom, her son Margrave Egbert I, died, leaving a son Egbert II to rule over the Brunon possessions. There was also a daughter Ger trude, who was of age when Gertrude I died and was already a widow by 1085. Little else is known about her except that she married thrice, ordered the construction of the cloister of the Benedictine monastery of St. Giles, a leading foundation of Brunswick, and became the sole heiress to her parents' posses sions when Egbert II was murdered in 1090. She died in 1117. More than three centuries later, this Gertrude is spoken of in laudable terms in the Chronicle of Saxony as a donatrix, the passage in the volume being illustrated with a colored woodblock (Figure 32). In it, demurely dressed as a nun, she is posed against the outline of the cloister she founded, holding a large reliquary chest. This historical data will be relevant when examining the commissioning of the four objects discussed here, d^ Ce SR 1492.X~ Brunswick.~ Sparticularly the Brunswick arm reliquary. That shrine (Figure 29) was made to hold an arm bone of St. Blaise, a martyr of Diocletian's time said to have been bishop of Sebastea in Armenia and venerated as a thaumaturge. The saintly bone is enclosed within a hollowed-out block of oak shaped as a raised arm on which have been applied delicately embossed gilt-silver sheets. The palm of the hand is open, the fingers extended in a combined gesture of trust and blessing as is clearly shown, for example, in one of the reliefs (Figure 25) on the Hildesheim bronze doors. The arm is represented as if clothed by the sleeve of a dalmatic, the rich sacerdotal vestment enlivened with borders and a diagonal band of stone insets and X filigree work. The underpart of the reliquary bears a Latin in scription clearly ringing with the pride of the donor (Figure 31). It reads in translation "I Gertrude have had this vessel made to hold the arm of St. Blaise the Martyr."'9 The two crosses (Color Plates I-III), which we shall differen tiate as the Cross of Count Liudolf and the Cross of Countess MImc ot flct, X -:Z Gertrude, are resplendent in their bejeweled gold and are con lo fiito i ON6M4t A'h; structed of beams nearly equal in length in the Byzantine tradi 6w 1n goE~ff~b6~ B2Stat^^r c 9c vbc$:.r S oe It r ,4,&gt; t'k*~c;~;'tt9 Oficn-vnfc Xr 46;drtr-tcttl E7?,7 _ .:ogqeEi&amp;tIfc$ f tf;tn ar Xstw~cWmccoffir t.:rc xii Figure 32.

They are almost identical in design and proportion to those held by Henry the Lion, his consort, and their ancestors in a famous miniature (Figure 33) of about 1185 in the gospel book commissioned by that duke. The two Cleveland crosses con sist of an oak core over which have been applied gold sheets embellished with enamel, precious stones, pearls, involved filigree, and embossing. While very similar to one another in general aspect, the crosses vary in detail as well as in the quali ty of workmanship.20 The finest of the two, Countess Gertrude's cross (Color Plates II, III B), is adorned with many precious and semi-precious cabochons - stones cut convexly and highly polished but not faceted- arranged symmetrically in gold settings. The principal ornament on each arm is an evangelist symbol - the eagle, the lion, the ox, and an angel - in cloisonne enamel. Today, only small sharp-colored particles of the fused glass paste remain, separated by their gold sectional walls, and it is the stones that now attract the eye: the epicentral almond-shaped, vertically pierced quartz crystal with its circular satellite of small emeralds, an onyx, a rock-crystal, and mother-of-pearl within the same thin border that marks the perimeter of the cross. On the arms are an onyx, a garnet, an amethyst, a sapphire, and a carnelian carved with the figure of a standing woman in classical garb, all within an array of many smaller stones. This cross actually includes no fewer than forty-eight settings for gems and pearls, the adjoining fields covered with delicate, meandering tendrils of gold filigree - a fine gold wire which has been hammered to form a string of beads. Theophilus, the German goldsmith writing a few decades after the Cleveland crosses were fashioned, described how the minute gold wires could be successfully affixed: take some of the fine wires, and beat them lightly on the an vil so that they are rather flat, yet the beads at the top and bottom do not lose their shape. With them you twist large and small flowers and with these you will fill all the grounds between the settings. When you have fashioned them with your fine tweezers, dip them into [a] moist paste [of flour] and set each one in position. When this is done, put them on the fire so that the paste is dried out, and immediately smear the flux over them and solder.2' We are further told that the proper flux for gold should be a mixture of beechwood ash, soap, salt, and a little lard from an old hog. The less ornate reverse of the cross has an embossed gold field with the Lamb of God stamped at center bearing the crossed staff(Color Plate IIIB). Distributed over the four arms is a Latin Figure 34. Cross of Count Liudolf (obverse). Engraving. G. W.

Delicately embossed in higher relief at the bottom of the vertical beam is a three-quarter length female figure dressed in a mantle and long veil as would befit a widow or a nun. It is undoubtedly a representation of the donatrix. Her glance is directed downward, while her right hand is raised in a traditional orant gesture. Stones and pearls make for an equally vivid impression in the Liudolf cross (Color Plates I, III A). The central massive opaque quartz is echoed by a large translucent crystal mark ing the end of each arm. The two beams (each 1.5 centimeters thick) were probably reset at an undetermined date and are no longer flush, the horizontal element protruding forward by six millimeters causing the circular central decoration to run awkwardly over two levels with three cabochon settings crush ed and stoneless. Attesting to the Medieval admiration of the glyptic art of classical times are the three deep red stones near the central field. Crudely carved with a profile head surround ed by an inscription in pseudo-Greek lettering, these stones are obviously northern imitations of ancient intaglios. The cloisonne enamel ornamentation of this cross, no less fragmentary than on the Gertrude cross, consists of a pair of confronting peacocks in blue, red, green, and white pastes on a square gold field in each of the four arms. The upper plaque is incongruously oriented sideways and has been in this posi tion since at least the late seventeenth century when the cross was first reproduced (Figure 34). The peacock, a ready symbol of immortality and of Christ's Resurrection - drawn from the ancient belief that its flesh never decayed - was an iconographic motif prominently used in Byzantine art; for example, on a folio (Figure 35) in a nearly contemporary gospel book, produced in Constantinople and now in Cleveland, bellicose peacocks confront one another at opposite sides of a diminutive render ing of the Fountain of Life. In Germany a frieze of related fighting birds occurs on a cloisonne enamel plaque somewhat earlier in date and incorporated in the Reliquary Shrine of St. Peter (Figure 36) of the third quarter of the eleventh century, in the Cathedral Treasury of Minden. The predominance of such a motif on the Liudolf Cross, however, is unmatched on any other German cross of the period. The reverse of this cross (Color Plate III A) attests to its fre quent handling. The delicately embossed work is so worn and battered that it is no longer easily read. In the central field stands the Lamb of God with the cruciform halo and bearing the crossed staff. It is nearly identical to its counterpart on the Ger Figure 36. Nimbed Busts Amid Peacocks. Cloisonn6 enamel medallion, Diam. 2-9/16 inches (6.6 cm.). Germany, Weserraum, early ninth century.

A symbol of the evangelists within a circle figures at the end of each beam, while in the narrow fields above and below the Lamb are two inscriptions. The first translates: "Relics of the saintly bishop Valerius and of Pancratius, martyr [and] of the stones which laid on the tomb of our Lord," referring to small relics which were once probably located under one of the enamel peacock plaques. The second inscription states: "This Gertrude has made for [the salvation of] Count Liudolf's soul." 35</page><page sequence="35">Figure 37.

Essen, Cathedral, Treasury. In addition to being reliquaries, the two crosses served ob vious funerary and dynastic commemorative purposes. Judg ing from the pierced iron extension at the base of each, they were intended to fit on long staffs and be carried in ritualistic ceremonies. A similar cross is held by Abbess Matilda of Essen and her young brother Duke Otto of Swabia as depicted at the foot of the large and magnificent cross which this abbess com missioned for her monastery around the year 980 (Figure 37). On other occasions such crosses may also have been placed on an altar. Devoid of the figure of the crucified Christ and shim mering with the multiple fires of their stones and the brilliance of their filigree, such crosses would have attained in the reddish glow of torch lights and the flicker of candles a marked transcendental symbolism. Higher in its artistic conception, and distinguished by its more exacting workmanship, is the portable altar (Color Plates v IX) bearing the inscription: "To live in the peace of the Lord, Gertrude presented to Christ this stone glistening with gold and gems." This dedication, unlike that on the Gertrude Cross, does not specify the rank of the donor, but in exalting the om nipotence of God, it clearly magnifies the privileged relation ship enjoyed by the noble woman.22 The use of portable altars had been codified by the Council of Carthage of 401 as a con secrated stone containing a holy relic on which mass could be performed by the clergy. The obvious advantage of a portable altar was that it could be easily transported and used for per forming the service outside of a church. The presence of several such liturgical furnishings in the Guelph Treasure suggests that some might have been commissioned by rulers of the House of Saxony for use during their multifarious travels and then, on account of the magnificence of the objects and the relics they enshrined, given to the treasury of their foundation. Portable altars on occasion also assumed the value of ex-votos, due to their small scale and exceptional importance as cult implements. From all appearances, they were then used in churches during special occasions. Judging from its inscription, which is clearly dedicatory, the portable altar bearing the name Gertrude appears in fact to have been intentionally made for placement in the collegiate church. It is a reduction of an actual altar and is among the earliest known of this shape which became generalized after 1100. It consists of a rectangular red porphyry slab (Color Plate v) in set in a gold-covered oak casket serving as reliquary chest. Among all other semi-precious materials, porphyry was par ticularly rich in symbolism; its very color recommended it to the cult of martyrs and saints and associated it with imperial I ,~~~~~~~~.~</page><page sequence="36">and princely power. Quarried in Lower Egypt until the fifth cen tury, it had been widely used in antiquity. The Middle Ages also valued this hard stone for the chromaticism of its feldspar crystals embedded within the compact purplish ground. When porphyry was available in Ottonian and Romanesque times, it was invariably in the form of an object from antiquity (Figure 26) or as a fragment of an antique monument. The origin of the gleaming stone which crowns the shrine in Cleveland must be no exception to this rule. At center of the base plate of the portable altar under a sheet of silver, is a trapdoor leading to a hollow cavity (Figure 38). The wooden core by and large seems to have been partly restored or changed in past centuries, while the lock on the small trap door does not date earlier than the eighteenth century. When recently opened for the first time since it entered the Museum, the portable altar revealed a series of small, fabric-wrapped bundles containing bone fragments and a stone (Figure 39). The textiles are Medieval, at least one silk is thirteenth-century Spanish, while others have, it would appear, a Byzantine origin. On some of them are sewn small parchment labels in a fifteenth century script identifying the bones as those of: (A) St. Herme tis, (B) St. Adelaide, (C) St. Vincent, martyr, (D) St. Gertrude, Figure 38. Base of Portable Altar of Countess Gertrude with trapdoor (CMA 31.462). (See also Color Plates v-ix.) and (E) St. Marcian, martyr. The bundle (F) consists of ten unidentified tiny individual packets which, according to the 1482 inventory, contain relics of SS. Stephen, Sophie, Perpetua, Paul, Barnaba, Philip, Simon, Thaddeus, John the Apostle, and James; (G) is a chip of unpolished marble in felt-like white paper identified in 1482 as a fragment of the block used to support the Holy Cross on Mount Golgotha; (H) is an unidentified frag ment of an arm or leg bone which the 1482 document suggests to be that of St. Gregory; (I) is an unidentified hip bone, perhaps a relic of St. Januarius in light of the same inventory; (J) is an arm bone identified as St. Bartholomew's. The surface of the portable altar gleams with embossed gold figures, cloisonne enamels, pearls, mother-of-pearl shaped as pearls, and polished stones. It is unrivaled for its richness among early portable altars. The shrine may once have been raised on claw feet as the St. Andrew portable altar (Figure 13) of Trier, but the corners of the base oak plank -conceivably not the original - do not show signs of perforation. At the top (Color Plate v), the porphyry slab is framed within three bands of gold, slightly restored in the fourteenth century as well as at a later date. The inner and outer borders are decorated with fine filigree work shaped as tendrils, while the central one bears the 37</page><page sequence="37">? ? r?-:: :? 'CQ ? t? ;a B il'lC1 I, u!

Particularly strik ing are the four friezes with embossed figures, each standing on its own small base, which surround the mensa. Enframed by gold borders of filigree work, cabochons, and pearls, each frieze was fashioned by embossing, that is hammering a sheet of gold from the underside to espouse the general desired form. No seams or folds are detectable on any of these surfaces despite the strong outward projection of shapes, especially faces-a feat of consummate craftsmanship. The delicate reliefs were subsequently chiseled while applied to a wooden base carved with a fair degree of attention to modeling and detail. A few miniscule losses of gold on the cloaks and base of the figures clearly reveal the presence of wood, identical in grain to that visible where the cabochon stones are missing. The fact that such a solid carved matrix was used accounts in large part for the near pristine condition of the reliefs, in contrast to most other embossed works of the period which have a more malleable and easily built wax support. The front panel (Color Plate vi) is divided by seven rounded arches supported on columns. This applied arcade of perfect ly preserved cloisonne enamel in a combination of four different geometric designs, shelters Christ, Peter, and five other apostles. These, like sturdy Saxon warriors, are figures with large bearded faces, staring eyes, long broad noses, and heavy jaws. Their in articulate bodies are clothed in loose layers of garments and a mantle that flutters gently as if blown by a sudden breeze. Peter holds two keys, the other unidentified disciples, a codex or a scroll. The six apostles turn slightly and gesture toward the fron tal Christ, forming a balanced group, monumental in its simplicity. The rear panel (Color Plate vii) is enframed by an embossed gold rather than enameled arcade. At center is the Virgin, austere in mood, with hands raised in an orant gesture; six apostles are symmetrically distributed on either side of her. If the craftsman ship of this panel is no less adept, the general conception and modeling of the figures is somewhat less successful, as if deriv ing from those on the front side. The field of each narrow end is in turn divided by a set of five applied arches. Those on the right side (Color Plate vIII) bear nielloed inscriptions and are supported on nielloed patterned columns. Under the central arch, inscribed SANCTACRVX, is a cloisonne enamel cross. In the arches flanking the cross appear four historical figures, venerable for their sanctity: Emperor Constantine the Great and his mother St. Helena, Sigismund, the sixth-century king of the Burgonds who brought his people to Christianity, and St. Adelaide, wife of Emperor Otto I, all attired in regal togas and turning to the cross with a slight bow, their hands gesturing to denote a deeply felt emotion. These expressively modeled figures were undoubtedly produced by the master responsible for the front relief. The applied arches and supporting columns on the left end (Color Plate IX) are deco rated with niello patterns. St. Michael, treading on the van quished dragon, presides, assisted by four angels, staves in hand. The goldsmith who fashioned the back panel with the Virgin and apostles was responsible for this relief. Although perhaps enigmatic at first, the iconographic pro gram of the portable altar is actually a rather focused one. Its message is simple: it propounds ideals of the saintly noble widow, and thus strongly implies that the altarpiece was com missioned by a woman who clearly related to this state. The Virgin, often likened in pious homilies to a widow after the Pas sion, appears here (Color Plate vii) as if in a state of doleful mourning. On the short right side (Color Plate viii) only two figures are identified as saints: Helena and Adelaide. Helena, whose faith was so instrumental in her son Constantine's becoming the first Christian emperor and whose sanctity made possible the finding of the True Cross, had lived in Germany, founding the first cathedral church of Trier when that city was the capital of the Roman Empire north of the Alps. No less purposeful than Helena in the iconographic scheme of the altar is Adelaide, a Burgundian princess by birth and therefore one of Sigismund's descendants. She was an outstand ing aristocratic figure widely venerated in the archbishopric of Magdeburg on which depended the sees of Hildesheim and Halberstadt, ruling over the Brunswick region. Married to Ot to I, the great emperor, and after his death regent of the em pire, Adelaide, of whom a relic is contained within the portable altar (Figure 39B), was hailed for her piety, generosity, and forgiveness. Adelaide died in 999, but her memory lingered on vividly, soon giving rise to a cult in north German convents. The fact that she was not canonized until 1097 might suggest that the portable altar, which bears the clear and evidently not added nielloed inscription SCA ADALHEID (Color Plate vIII), should not be dated any earlier than 1097, and that by exten sion the inscribed name GERTRVDIS refers to Gertrude II. It should, however, be noted that before the twelfth century, local archbishops and bishops had the power to accept or officially recognize sanctity in venerated individuals before their formal canonization in Rome, so long as the cult was only promulgated in territories over which they held jurisdiction. It was a form 39</page><page sequence="39">RIGHT Figure 40. Fragments of Goldsmith Work from the Hildesheim Gold Madonna. Gold, gems, and pearls. Germany, Lower Saxony, Hildesheim, ca. 1030.

Many saints, some of high lineage, were indeed venerated before their formal canonization as, for example, the nearly contemporary King Stephen of Hungary.23 Though varying in degrees of quality, the four Guelph Treasure objects here under study bear enough common points of technique and general aesthetics to suggest that they were produced by a group of goldsmiths all related to a single workshop tradition, and were made in the following sequence: the Liudolf cross, the Gertrude cross, the portable altar, and last, the St. Blaise arm reliquary. The fine filigree on these pieces is particularly striking among German eleventh-century goldsmith works. Especially distinctive and similar in thickness and design is the gold thread on the two crosses and on the por table altar with its elegant, controlled heart patterns, diamond shaped leaves, and small tendrils. The wire on the arm reliquary is thicker and somewhat less successful in layout with a busier design which also lacks the particularly appealing diamond shaped leaves. The death of Count Liudolf in 1038 provides a terminuspost quem for the cross bearing his name (Color Plates I, IIIA), while the death of his widow in 1077 in turn provides a clear terminus ante quem for it. It stands to reason that the cross as an in tercessory object would have been made soon after the count was buried. So close is the stylistic relationship of the two crosses that it must be Liudolf's widow who also commissioned and is represented on the other cross. The cross made for Liudolf's spiritual welfare probably slightly preceded Gertrude's own, but both, then, were most likely made soon after 1038. Taking into account the rigidity of Medieval social codes clearly respected in the scheme of the portable altar, it would also in deed be unthinkable that Gertrude I would have commissioned an object bearing only her name unless she were already a widow. The portable altar, as we have seen, with its iconography of the saintly noble widow is particularly befitting Countess Ger trude I. In addition, it so clearly relates to the two crosses that it seems stylistically indissociable from them and must date to a period close in time. Gertrude II was only widowed for the first time in 1085, a dating which would seem rather late on stylistic grounds for the altar. Of course, the alternative of plac ing its production after Adelaide's formal canonization date of 1097 would present an even greater hiatus in terms of style. The arm reliquary (Figure 29), both on stylistic grounds and on the basis of its inscription, can be dated as late as Gertrude I'S death or even cshrtlvthereaftper There ic therefore no rlenr gauge for assessing whether she or her granddaughter might have been responsible for this particular commission. Though not actually supported by documents, Gertrude II, as pointed out, is also remembered in Saxon history as a donatrix of goldsmith works. The where of these four commissions is nearly as tantaliz ing as the who and when. Located at the point of the Oker at which it ceased to be navigable, Brunswick was a crossroad and as such more than an occasional trading center. It was not yet a town, however, in the eleventh century and hence would not have fostered skilled craftsmanship. The countesses therefore had to look beyond their immediate territories to commission rare goldsmith works. Henry II's reign, ending in 1024, had set the stage for an un precedented outburst of activity in the field of smithery. The emperor, a Saxon, had ordered works from leading craftsmen for his many foundations, particularly that of Bamberg. His commissions, as his travels, however, were distributed over a wide geographical area, although St. Gall and nearby Reichenau on the Lake of Constance may have been more particularly favored. After 1024, with the reign of Conrad II and Henry II, Cologne and its satellites on the Lower Rhine and Saxon centers-mainly Hildesheim but also Magdeburg, east of Brunswick, Quedlinburg to the south, and Gandersheim to the southwest, all sites of large wealthy convents closely tied by their foundation to the imperial seat - were favored with court patronage in return for their political support and loyalty. These convents had a particularly important stature since many of their nuns were members of the nobility. The shift north and west strongly affected the artistic production of the third and subsequent decades of the eleventh century, corresponding par ticularly to Countess Gertrude I's patronage. As in the case of ivory carvers, there was a fair amount of mobility among the skilled goldsmiths who worked for the imperial convents and the court circle, but in their case the necessity of a physically established workshop furnished with furnaces, specialized tools, and equipment was of paramount importance. Hilde sheim, located some thirty miles from Brunswick, and whose bishop consecrated the collegiale, had been a center of metal smithing since the end of the ninth century and received an even greater impetus in this direction in the tenth century under St. Bernward. Besides the great bronzes (Figures 15, 24-25, 53), Bernward had ordered a number of reliquaries, a gilt-silver nielloed candlestick, a silver bishop's crozier, and other imple ments. His successors Godehard, Azelin, and Hezilo continued in thick n!tewnrthv trncitinn thnlcrh nn n anrs r nf c-A-,, 24 40</page><page sequence="40">A Hildesheim provenance for the two crosses and for the por table altar in Cleveland is supported by actual stylistic evidence. The filigree of these three objects finds a particularly apt ground of comparison in two small gold elements (Figure 40) with iden tical heart shapes and squared-off tendrils originally part of the Hildesheim Gold Madonna, a famous votive figure once resplendent with goldsmith work before it was vandalized in the Baroque period and reduced to a sad wooden core (Figure 41). In its heyday it was no less renowned and venerated than its better-known counterpart in Essen.25 The Hildesheim Gold Madonna was made around 1040, providing another element for a rather early dating of the Cleveland crosses and portable altar and confirming their probable commission by Countess Gertrude I. A Hildesheim provenance for Gertrude's portable altar would explain the presence of St. Michael on the left side panel (Color Plate Ix). The archangel was particularly ven erated in that town where St. Bernward had dedicated to St. Michael the monastery to which he destined much of the great art work he had made. : - The filigree work of the Arm Reliquary of St. Blaise (Figure 30) can similarly be clearly equated to that of an important Hildesheim-made object: the so-called Great Cross of St. Bern ward (Figure 42) which holds the relic of the True Cross given by the emperor to the saintly bishop. As demonstrated by Her mann Schnitzler, the cross for the most part was not fashioned until late. The late eleventh century rather than the twelfth as he proposes, however, seems a more probable time. The small gold crucified Christ -close in style to the figures on Abbot Erkanbald's crozier made on order of Bernward around the year 1000, which the cross also incorporates and which has been in terpreted by another historian as actual proof of the bishop's commission - represents, in fact, but a memento of Bernward ian times.26 In both the Brunswick arm reliquary and the Hildesheim cross, the cabochons are similarly surrounded with rather thick gold thread with comparatively strong beading. It may also be pointed out that arm-shaped reliquaries seem to be a late eleventh-century development among shrines; iden tifying the patron of the St. Blaise shrine securely as Gertrude 41</page><page sequence="41">r; ?1 1 ?::: 1 T3L? r ??SP?fj? wt i: i ,?</page><page sequence="42">Figure 42.

Hildesheim, Cathedral, Treasury (on deposit from the Kirche St. Magdalenen). I meets with substantive impediments on this count as well. The two commemorative crosses and the portable altar of the Countess of Brunswick, as in the case of the ivory plaque of the Miracle at Cana, hark back in conception to a group of objects of distinctive quality produced in Trier in the late tenth century for Archbishop Egbert, a granduncle of Count Liudolf's wife. Imperial chaplain as well as chancellor, he fostered, as we have seen, the activity of artists in his see and among them, goldsmiths. It may well be that the success of Trier as an art center depended nearly as much on the inspiration pro vided by that great artist, the Master of the Registrum Gregorii, as on Egbert himself. Empress Theophanu ordered noteworthy pieces of goldsmith work from Egbert's workshop, and such was the fame of Trier that Archbishop Adalbero of Reims, as we have seen, requested objects made in this center all the way from the French realm. In Trier were fashioned the PortableA Itar andReliquary of St. Andrew's Sandal(Figure 13), the Reliquary of the Holy Nails, the St. Peter Staffwhich enshrines another nail of the Passion, the resplendent binding (Figure 43) of a gospel book -the Codex Aureus- and probably the small rectangular plaques with the symbols of the evangelists (Figure 44) in cloisonne enamel now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.27 A striking element of the Trier pieces is the inclusion of small luminescent cloisonne enamels which are, however, always carefully subordinated to the form of the object. The eight enamel plaques on the two crosses commissioned by Countess Gertrude (Color Plates I-II) bear a clear relationship to the delicate enamels of Trier, particularly those on the Portable Altar andReliquary of St. Andrew's Sandal (Figure 13), as well as to the small plaques in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Figure 44). Though fashioned with artistry and care, the plaques of Gertrude's crosses betray a limited knowledge of the enameling technique on the part of the craftsmen, probably Saxons, who fashioned them. A shallow layer of enamel was distributed on too thin a base of gold and between equally delicate walls, the whole resulting in great fragility and the even tual loss of much of the colorful decoration.

Essen, Cathedral, Treasury. is closely related in technique to the delicate reliefs of the St. Peter Staffand the CodexAureus (Figure 43) where Empress Theophanu is represented frontally in Byzantine style, not unlike Theodora in the famous mosaics of San Vitale in Raven na, surrounded by an embossed inscription identifying her as donatrix. The countenance of Countess Gertrude is obviously more subdued, her glance less direct. If the goldsmith studied Trier works, he was, however, not slavishly dominated by them. Instead, he looked to forms with which he was familiar and which were appropriate in the Saxon mid-eleventh century con text, such as the contemporary Mary Magdalene carved figure (Figure 45) on the exterior of the Convent Church of St. Cyriacus at Gernrode near Quedlinburg in Saxony. Around 1040, when also ordering a great cross (Figure 46), an impressive reliquary, and a sumptuous binding for a gospel book (Figure 47), Empress Theophanu's granddaughter, of the same name, on becoming abbess of Essen - a House founded in the ninth century by Bishop Altfrid of Hildesheim and 44</page><page sequence="44">Figure 48.

The latter, fifty years earlier, had commissioned three large crosses from a workshop apparent ly active at the nearby Benedictine Abbey of Werden rather than in Essen proper. 28 This group of goldsmiths was clearly atuned to the abstract effects and technical feats of the Trier School, while certainly aware of the Colognese style with its softer and somewhat lyrical forms. As a whole, the four bejeweled crosses commissioned by Abbesses Matilda and Theophanu show a marked progression toward surface abstraction, an aesthetic Figure 49. Votive Cross of Berengar I.

The earliest of the three large crosses of Abbess Matilda (Figure 37), dating to about 980, and on which she is represented with Otto of Swabia, bears a large figure of the Savior surround ed by orderly rows of stones. This representation of Christ, fashioned in the Colognese style, is modeled after the Gero Crucifix of 970-76 in the Cathedral of Cologne. Matilda's sec ond and third crosses (Figure 48) show a marked reduction in the size of the crucified figure at this stage represented on a small enamel plaque, in direct proportion to a new emphasis on greater and more colorful ornamentation.

These precious objects were also the work of goldsmiths temporarily active at the Abbey of Werden and the true heirs of the Trier School and who may have worked earlier in Milan, as we shall see. The binding of Abbess Theophanu's gospel book (Figure 47), which can be dated be tween 1039 and 1056, provides yet another gauge with its delicately embossed reliefs with standing figures on bases under arcades. The two crosses commissioned by Gertrude I (Color Plates I-III) are certainly part of the new aesthetic, yet they do not reach the degree of involved surface abstraction of Theophanu's objects, perhaps a useful element for corrobor ating the dating of the two Cleveland crosses to shortly after 1038. Despite a close technical relationship to contemporary German goldsmith works, the two crosses commissioned by the countess very conservatively retain both the Greek shape and the personal quality of jewels, centered on a gleaming roundel, sanctified by a long tradition of princely patronage, and clear ly seen in the ninth-century Votive Cross ofBerengarI (Figure 49) in the Monza Cathedral Treasury. Gertrude's portable altar derives in general outline from those large altars built in churches over the relics of martyr saints. Again, the classic antecedent of such reductions might seem to be a Trier one, the Portable Altar and Reliquary of St. An drew's Sandal (Figure 13), though the direct model might be Byzantine. Indeed, the conception behind the actual layout of Gertrude's portable altar seems to derive from adaptations of Byzantine works first evolved in North Italy by the Lombards with the great Paliotto (Figure 50) of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan dating to ca. 850 standing as the prime example and source of inspiration for prominent intermediaries such as the great gold altar front (Figure 51) given by Emperor Henry ii and his wife Cunigonde by 1019 to the Cathedral of Basel, and perhaps also for the lostpalaof Bishop Bernward at Hildesheim.9 In Henry u's antependium, arcades shelter full-length figures heralding the architecture and layout of Countess Gertrude's portable altar. Although embossed, the figures gracing the imperial gift, with their frontal stance and suspended animation, are still ele ments of a decorated surface in the time-honored Ottonian tra dition. In contradistinction, the figures of Gertrude's altar are solid and pivot, as do those on the binding of Abbess Theo phanu's gospels (Figure 47), in order to relate to a central image. Of likely importance is the role of Magdeburg in the concep tion of Gertrude I's portable altar. Although Adelaide's tomb was not there but in her native Burgundy, it is in the cathedral which stood as his great foundation; that Emperor Otto I, her husband, was buried. The documentary evidence for Magde burg is scanty in the eleventh century, but we do know, for ex ample, that Archbishop Engelhardus (1052-1063) commis sioned several pieces of now lost goldsmith work including caskets and the cover for the Codex Wittekindeus with images in gilt-silver set with gems and the dedicatory inscription ENGELHARDVS ARCHIEPC ME FIERI IVSSIT in a formula similar to that of the dedication on the cross of Countess Gertrude (Color Plate III B).30 Perhaps on account of its strong imperial connection, the archbishopric also had substantial contact with Italy, where sculpture, unlike in Germany, was widely practiced as an art. Remains of monumental Ottonian carvings at the Cathedral of Magdeburg (Figure 52), rare examples of German large-scale three-dimensional art of the period, though frieze like, show bodies twisting in their animation as well as possessing some sense of bulk. 3 The program of Countess Gertrude's port able altar as well as the nascent Romanesque layout of its friezes might thereby imply a Magdeburg influence. The strong features given to some of the figures in addition suggest that the master goldsmith had a hard look at the bronze column (Figure 53) adapted, with christological subjects, from the one of Trajan in Rome - cast in Hildesheim about 1010 before he started what was always to be considered a major and unique piece of art in the Guelph Treasure. In the fifteenth century the shrine was displayed on major occasions in the Brunswick church with a reliquary on it of no less significance than that containing a frag ment of the skull of St. Blaise (see Figure 152).32 Witness to the fortunes and upheavals of the Brunons, their collegiate church slowly flourished in the shadow of Dankward erode. In the later years of the eleventh century, as if emulating the ruling family's sumptuous gifts, the canons also contributed to the wealth of the foundation, a largess not uncommon among clerics of the time. Two rather modest portable altars in the Guelph Treasure are evidence of these generous acts, both shrines deriving in their general form from Countess Gertrude's resplendent example. The earliest (Figure 54), dating perhaps to around 1075, is somewhat smaller than its model but likewise enlivened with embossed figures of Christ and the apostles, each also on a base and in an intercolumniation but gesturing in a contrived manner. Rank provincialism marks the craftsman ship of the work, perhaps produced by one of the officiants of the collegiale. The second portable altar, which still contains 47</page><page sequence="47">Figure 52. Beatitudes. High relief limestone figures. Germany, Magdeburg, early eleventh century. Magdeburg, Cathedral.

The landmarks that firmly dated objects provide are rare oc currences in Medieval goldsmith works. A Saxon document of 15 August 1100 represents the evidence for such a milestone. In a deed bearing that date, Heinrich von Werl, Bishop of Pader born, grants to the Abbey of Helmarshausen a church as well as tithes in retribution for a gold cross and a reliquary chest made for him by a monk of that institution, named Roger. The reli quary chest, actually a portable altar (Figure 55), is today in the Diocesan Museum of Paderborn. On one side are embossed reliefs of SS. Kilian and Liborius flanking a Christ in Majesty, as specified in the document, while in a nielloed silver plaque on top is a representation of Bishop Heinrich with a dedicatory inscription naming him.34 Roger of Helmarshausen's work exemplifies a new more exhuberant style with figures clothed in broad, clinging robes with curvilinear folds nesting small v shaped folds, a drapery effect paralleled only at the time, it seems, in manuscripts produced locally and in monasteries of the Meuse Valley. This style, if a transitional one, heralds the new twelfth-century striving for order, characterized by heaviness and monumentality, in direct contrast to the nervous calligraphic style of Ottonian times. By the turn of the century, portable altars had become highly coveted among ecclesiastical implements and were to be produced in unending numbers at least through the 1170s. A fourth example from the Guelph Treasure (Figure 56), embossed with stumpy figures of apostles nervously gesticulating and set between prominent columns with unusual shafts of carved rock crystal, reflects in a mitigated way that style so clearly expounded in the work of Roger of Helmarshausen. Egbert II, last male heir of the Brunons, was murdered in 1090, and on the death of his sister Margravine Gertrude, the earldom passed through her daughter Richenza, wife of Emperor Lothar III, to the imperial family. Their daughter, a third Gertrude, in 1127 married Henry the Proud of the House of Guelph, duke of Bavaria and Swabia. Shortly thereafter, the bridegroom was endowed by his father-in-law with the whole of the Duchy of Saxony, Dankwarderode, and its collegiate church passing as part of Gertrude's personal dowry into the Guelph family. From this union, two years afterwards, was born an only son, the future Henry the Lion. Figure 53. River of Paradise. Bronze. Germany, Lower Saxony, Hildesheim, ca. 1000-10(?).

Detail of Great Cross of Aribert of Antimiano. Gilt copper. Italy, Milan, ca. 1040. Milan, Cathedral Museum, Inv. 131. The Guelphs, whose cradle had been Weingarten, a pictur esque alpine spot north of the Lake of Constance, had left their mark on German politics beginning in the preceding century. An earlier member of the family, Guelph v, uncle of Henry the Proud, had married Countess Matilda of Tuscany, before whose castle at Canossa, Henry Iv, Holy Roman emperor, knelt barefoot in the snow to ask and receive absolution from Pope Gregory vii. It was a crucial moment in the age-long conflict between ecclesiastic and secular power, and marked the com plete, if momentary, victory of the pope. It was probably through Countess Matilda's husband that an eleventh-century object known as the Guelph Cross (Figure 57) came to the Treasure of Brunswick. This gold work was pro duced in Milan sometime before 1045 in the workshop fostered by Aribert of Antimiano, yet another famous princely prelate, who left to the treasury of his cathedral a great cross with an incisive figure of Christ (Figure 58) and also a gospel book with a resplendent binding (Figure 59), including filigree work, 52</page><page sequence="52">Figure 59.

The unstructured Christ with large nimbus of Matilda's first cross (Figure 37) and the series of small enamels with styl ized beasts on Theophanu's cross (Figure 46) perhaps found a partial inspiration in the Aribert Workshop. The Guelph Cross (Figure 57) enshrines a relic, presumably a fragment of the True Cross. Affixed to its obverse by eight pins delicately entwined with gold wire and bedecked with a small stone, is a flat Byzantine breast cross with rounded ends with Christ and bust-length representations of the Virgin, St. John, and a third unidentified figure, in the finest of cloisonne work. The four ends extending beyond the breast cross are enlivened with translucent stones and pearls on a field given to delicate filigree work shaped as small hooks as on the binding of Aribert's gospels (Figure 59). Contrasting to the delicate and minute forms of the cross, are the cast gilt-brass shaft and base on which it is set. The solid torsaded column with a Corinthian capital is supported by a base boldly ornamented with three grimacing tiger heads and nude genii; the latter, fitted with outspread wings, are impatient ly staring outward, one leg crossed as if unconvinced of their vocation and waiting for relief. Incisively chiseled, these broad forms can readily be associated with the features of Christ (Figure 58) on Aribert's great cross, while their general forms and countenance may derive from such well-known monuments as the facade of Modena's cathedral with its reliefs by Wiligelmo. So admired was the Guelph Cross, while probably still in Milan, that a second nearly identical one (Figure 60) was made, though it was subsequently restored in the thirteenth century.36 54</page><page sequence="54">CHAPTER III Henry the Lion and the Arts of Twelfth-Century Lower Saxony Although his ancestors had played a vital role in the formation of the Guelph Treasure, Henry the Lion was its major benefac tor, acquiring or commissioning most of the important reliquar ies.

An inscription in golden let ters on the fourth folio of the famous gospel book the duke com missioned about 1185 also praises him for decorating and enlarg ing that edifice ("Templis ornavit ac muris amplificavit"). Henry is the most striking figure of all the Guelphs, "a prince of the princes of the earth" as Helmold von Bosau, another chronicler, spoke of this owner of vast estates in Germany, Poland, and Austria, who fiercely resisted imperial encroachments. Henry contended that a duke had the right - and should have the power as in pre-imperial days - to make all laws necessary for the in ternal welfare of his lands. Unlike his cousin and rival, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who dreamed of re-creating a truly Roman empire, the Lion was against the Hohenstaufen's generally abortive and always expensive campaigns in the Italian peninsula; rather, he was intent on extending the frontiers of Germany beyond the widely open and readily accessible plains of the north across which the Weser, the Elm, the Elbe, and the Oder flow to meet the shores of the North and Baltic seas. There Henry won, after dogged perseverance, considerable tracts of marshland on which he settled tenacious Flemish and Frisian immigrants who reclaimed the soil. The Lion did everything in his power to encourage the slowly developing merchant class of northern Germany and founded what came to be the most flourishing center of commerce in that region, the city of Liibeck. Duke Henry used vigorous methods to increase his ter ritorial hegemony including outright cruelty against the Slavs and much desultory warfare with his neighbors as Helmold von Bosau's chronicle makes evident.3 7 It is no coincidence that the astonishing lion (Figure 4), an image of threat as well as vigilance, which the duke placed prominently before his castle at Brunswick in 1166, is reminiscent of the famous Roman she wolf of 500 BC on the Capitoline Hill, eternal symbol of un bridled might. Henry was first married to Clementia of Zahringen, whom he subsequently repudiated. Through a new union with Matilda on 1 February 1168, he gained an alliance with the royal house of England, the bride being Henry ii Plantagenet's eldest daughter and sister of Richard the Lionheart and John Lack land. Eventually, Henry's own son would rise to be emperor under the name of Otto iv, while his daughter Gertrude be came queen of Denmark. A famous page (Figure 33) of the gospel book Duke Henry gave to the future Cathedral of St. Blaise includes the only certain contemporary portrait of him, Matilda, and their progenitors. Here, in a broadened version of Ottonian images of consecration (Figure 11), the kneeling duke and his consort are crowned from the heavens by divine hands. In 1139 Henry succeeded his father as duke of Saxony and in 1155 received Bavaria, which had also been part of his father's dominions. Henry the Lion was to die in his castle of Dank warderode on 6 August 1195. Shortly after the middle of the century he had transformed Brunswick from a modest hamlet into an actual town. In addition to seeing to the construction of the quarters near the Burgplatz, he created the new districts of Hagen and Neustadt with settlers from the Netherlands. In about 1175, the duke enlarged the ancestral stronghold, transforming it into an imposing castle with an improved defense system. The new church - now dedicated to SS. Blaise and John the Baptist, and of which the recumbent effigy of Duke Henry holds a model (see Figure 3) close to its original conception - with its large cavernous crypt was the first major structure in Lower Saxony in which vaulting was used. In 1172, having reached the height of his power and wealth, Henry the Lion set forth "in great glory" on a long pilgrimage to the Holy Land, returning to Brunswick a year later. Accom panied by a retinue of over five hundred, including an arch bishop, several counts, and abbots, it was no humble enterprise. Arnold von Lubeck's Chronicle of the Slavs fortuitously in cludes the diary of the learned Abbot Heinrich of the monastery of St. Giles at Brunswick, who journeyed with the Saxon par ty. In his account, the cleric stressed Henry's veneration for holy relics and related that while returning from Palestine, Henry was presented with fourteen mules loaded with gold and silver and silken vestments by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel Com nenus. While expressing "immense thanks," the duke made it known that however precious these objects might be, he would by far prefer relics of certain saints. Constantinople, where the seat of the church had been transferred in the fourth century, was the great repository of saintly mementos and in fact less than a decade after Henry the Lion's death when the Venetians sacked the city, they greedily took as part of their booty no fewer than 400 reliquaries. Within the twelfth-century political check erboard, Manuel Comnenus's steadfast ambition was to re establish the unity of a single empire East and West under his own rule and thus bring down Frederick Barbarossa. The relics Henry the Lion coveted were readily given to him, the emperor 55</page><page sequence="55">adding "much glory of precious stones" to the gift. Manuel's ready willingness to please his guest was perhaps a political ploy to find a sympathetic ear for his ambitious schemes. When the duke returned to his seat of Brunswick in 1173, the precious relics made for a triumphal entry. The abbot, unfortunately a laconic narrator, related only that Henry presented to the Burgkirche of St. Blaise the "reliquis sanctorum, quas secum attulerat, ves tiens eas auro et argento et lapidibus pretiosis, inter quas etiam erant brachia apostolorum plura."38 Duke Henry also brought back to Brunswick some of the goldsmith works for which Constantinople was so renowned. Examples in the Guelph Treasure may have also come in part through Otto IV, who may have acquired them from returning crusaders after the great city was basely sacked in 1204. Among the precious Byzantine objects in the Treasury of St. Blaise figured the twelfth-century golden Icon of St. Demetri (Figure 61). This warrior saint, often likened to St. George, is here represented on horseback and in the attire of a Roman procon sul. His large staring face with its surface of pink enamel, stands out vividly against the punched gold ground. Floral motifs of blue and white cloisonne enamel and a Greek inscription iden tifying the saint decoratively fill the surrounding surfaces. This plaque may be related to outstanding Byzantine works of the late eleventh and twelfth century such as the Icon of St. Michael (Figure 62) with its equally prominent enameled head, a shrine added to the cathedral treasury of Venice in 1204.39 Another object from Constantinople in the Guelph Treasure is a twelfth-century portable altar (Figure 63), or rather "altar 56</page><page sequence="56">OPPOSITE Figure 61.

Indicative of the many changes objects sometimes un derwent is the silver plaque with medallions of saints, a Saxon work of the early thirteenth century, inserted over the edges of the agate slab within the Byzantine frame. It may be that the stone had been damaged. While in the Holy Land, Henry commissioned mosaics and silver doors for a chapel of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

All four share a Siculo-Arabic origin, that is, they were fashioned in Sicily by Muslim craftsmen. The two boxes consist of a wooden core covered by thin ivory plaques with a surface decoration of gold abstract patterns and fasten ed by heavy brass clamps. Judging from the extant number of such receptacles in northern European museums, they were items frequently brought back by returning travelers. Of the two oliphants, one is in Brunswick (Figure 65) while the other is in Cleveland (Color Plate x and Figure 66),41 the latter be 59</page><page sequence="59">ing referred to in the Guelph inventories as the "Horn of St. Blaise" with the further indication that it was held by silver rings inset with precious stones. According to pious lore reported by Neumann, the saint is reputed to have used the horn to sum mon the faithful to worship as church bells did not yet exist at his time. A fifteenth-century votive statuette (Figure 67) in the Guelph Treasure and an illustration of the Chronicle ofSaxony of 1492 (Figure 68) depict the saint in his episcopal vestments, a silver crozier in one hand and a large ivory horn in the other. The Cleveland oliphant is masterfully shaped with a series of six carved bands, five with a foliage pattern, while the outer ring (Figure 66) depicts sequences from a hunt with a central motif of the Kriophorus- an athlete bearing a stag on his shoulder - deriving from antiquity. Such horns, while originally design ed for the hunt, primarily served a ceremonial purpose. Every great prince and wealthy treasury vied to own one; there is such a horn, for example, dating to about the year 1000 in the Im perial Treasury at Aachen.42 Figure 67.

Purchase from the J. H. Wade Fund. CMA 26.428 By 1175, two years after his return to Brunswick, Henry's un easy relationship with his cousin, Emperor Frederick Bar barossa, was severely strained. Some twenty-five miles south of Brunswick on the western slopes of the Harz Mountains lay Goslar, an imperial possession and a city particularly wealthy for its silver and copper mines. Located so close to his capital, Goslar was highly coveted by the duke, but for both economic and political reasons, the emperor held it tightly in his posses sion. When Frederick sought Henry's assistance in 1174 to fight the Lombard League, the Lion named his price: Goslar. When Frederick refused, Henry would not contribute to the Italian campaign. As a result, the Lombards, who had received heavy subsidies of gold from Manuel Comnenus, defeated the im perial army at Legnano on 28 May 1176. A territorial dispute between Henry the Lion and Bishop Udalric of Halberstadt was to provide the emperor with legal grounds for bringing on the duke's downfall. Evading all court assignments and refusing to yield, Henry was finally stripped of his duchies in January of 1180 by the electors of the Imperial Diet. Although his alodial fiefs of Brunswick and Liineburg were returned to him by 1181, the Lion obviously could not tolerate this compromise. He was soon scheming to reconsoli date his position which eventually led the emperor to banish him. The duke found refuge from November 1181 until the spring of 1185 at the court of his father-in-law, Henry II of England. Henry the Lion, in addition to casting a long shadow on the history of twelfth-century Germany, was also a major patron of the arts.43 From the ablest craftsmen that could be found, he ordered enameled shrines of silver and gold often set with gems for the relics he acquired. Some of these precious works are examined here. Since, with one notable exception, no records exist revealing who the goldsmiths were and where they actual ly worked, an analysis of this part of the Treasure must intro duce related material essential for pinpointing geographical ori gins as well as for proposing attributions to workshops. In metalwork, the major development of the twelfth century is the overwhelming adoption of the champleve enamel tech nique, first and foremost in the Meuse Valley, but also in Ger many, northern France, and England. Unlike the raised cloisonne, this process requires gouging out channels in metal plaques leaving only thin walls of metal as well as supporting pins. Molten glass of different hues is then poured in the depres sions. The result is a luminous polvchromed image with an ex 62</page><page sequence="62">Figure 70.

With this new technique the goldsmith could rival and even surpass the work of the painter, at least ? in the sense that his art is more enduring. The advent of cham pleve was concurrent with, and not independent from, a full commitment to the new Romanesque style in which figures are given greater physical bulk and scenes are depicted with a clear intent on legibility. Champleve enameling in its new appealing form (Figure 69), was developed in monastic institutions of the Meuse Valley. Like Abbot Suger of St. -Denis near Paris, who readily looked to new styles and techniques to bring glory to his abbey, the ranking ecclesiastics of the Meuse constantly sought ways to represent vividly that infinite lexicon of patristic symbols, parallels, and anti-types which nurtured the thoughts of the age. Where such depictions first burgeoned in all their spontaneity was obviously not in enamels but in manuscript illuminations (Figures 70-71). The artist-monks visually translated with quick strokes of pen and brush, the concepts developed by their superiors. There can i~ I be little doubt that the combination of prosperous abbeys with this vigorous production of illuminated manuscripts, as well as the ready availability of copper and tin from local mines, pro - |C~~ vided the climate in which the phenomenon of Mosan enamels _ - Figure 71.

And flourish they did, not only in Liege but also in abbeys such as Stavelot where the gifted Wibald, a keen patron of the arts, doubled his abbacy with being the powerful chan cellor of three German emperors. The earliest dated piece on which typically Mosan champleve enameling is employed is the HeadReliquary of Pope Alexander ordered by Abbot Wibald and completed in 1145.44 In Germany, the regions where the new technique particularly took root are Westphalia, with Cologne as center, and Saxony, principally it would appear in Hildesheim. Cologne, geograph ically not far removed from the Meuse, had the earliest, largest, and longest lasting workshops whose output was geared to a widely scattered market, with a limited direct patronage of bishops and princes. The one important goldsmith-enameler of that city toward the middle of the eleven hundreds is Eilber tus, who fashioned a major shrine of the Guelph Treasure, a portable altar (Figure 72) resplendent with gilt-copper plaques partly in the new champleve technique and partly in the tradi tional cloisonne. The base plate (Figure 73) is decorated with 65</page><page sequence="65">??L????L ?:? :--?i??YL?C??'FCe k. ?T"?CL?I? a Lar? ?

The top of the altar (Figure 74) is no less innovative in con ception than it is masterly in execution. At center, sunk under the nebulous sparkle of a protective sheet of rock crystal, is a miniature of the Colognese School with Christ the Judge hold ing the book of his teachings between the alpha and omega. Surrounding this visionary image are four champlev6 plaques with the twelve seated apostles, each in reserved gilt-copper - that is, not enameled but with features defined by means of en graved lines filled with niello - identified and displaying a con spicuous scroll. Backgrounds are composed of frames of light and dark blue, and sharp green. The copper has been so finely chiseled out that the delicate walls forming compartments for the enamels appear as if mere sketched outlines. On the ends of this altar table are two vertical plaques, each with four scenes depicting events related to Christ's birth, his infancy, and the Redemption. The style, if more linear, is reminiscent of con temporary or slightly earlier Mosan enamels. Far more thought out in architectonic terms than Gertrude's and Heinrich von Werl's portable altars (Color Plates v-ix and Figure 55), Eilbertus's is articulated by a series of pilasters ap pearing to support the mensa. In the seemingly recessed spaces are prophets, quietly gesturing. The figures, as well as the ar chitectural elements, are enameled, but here in the time-honored technique of cloisonne with its contrasting rather than melting effect; these glistening forms appearing against the solid gold background easily conjure up the effect of mosaics. The cloisonne enamel technique here adopted by Eilbertus is actual ly in part the refined tray technique whereby cloisons (walls) are removed once the molten glass poured in an area has hard ened; another contiguous section is then filled. This was ob viously a particularly delicate and difficult procedure as both cracking and mixing of colors could readily occur at multiple stages of production. The masterful handling of the two enamel techniques as exemplified in the Eilbertus altar significantly ex tended the expressive range of the metalworker's craft. Figure 74. Mensa of Portable Altar of Eilbertus. Where Eilbertus created his altar is unknown. The fact that he specified Cologne in the inscription only informs us surely of his origin. When it was produced and acquired by the Guelphs is not any clearer (all enameled inscriptions are textual quota tions); stylistically, a dating of shortly after 1150 would seem highly probable, thereby making it likely that the altar was a commission or purchase of Henry the Lion. No other work that we know of can be attributed to Eilber tus. Contemporary Colognese enamels seem to echo his style, though certainly never reaching the master's level of artistry and technical perfection. From about 1160 through the early 1180s, champleve enameling in Cologne came to be dominated by the Gregorius Workshop whose production is best exemplified in a portable altar at Siegburg (Figure 75). The craftsmen here used a very limited range of rather monochrome blue and gray hues in conjunction with a broad drawing and figures with somewhat flattened features. In the mid-1180s, the Colognese style became somewhat more animated, as seems to be exemplified in a plaque of the Judgment andMartyrdom of St. Lawrence, now in Cleve land (Color Plate xII E).45 Only in the late 1180s with enamels such as the series of trapezoid plaques with busts of apostles divided between the Kestner (Figure 76) and British museums and Bamberg Cathedral, did Colognese enamelers turn away from the Gregorius style, but only after having had a long fresh look at the new and even more subtle Mosan production epito mized in the work of Nicholas of Verdun.46 Apart from Cologne, if there is one other area of Germany that was particularly receptive to the style represented by Eilber tus's champlev6 enamels, from about 1155 until the 1190s, it is Lower Saxony. This has led the historians Otto von Falke and Georg Swarzenski to propose that Eilbertus worked for Henry the Lion right in Saxony.47 With no evidence on hand, however, it may be that Eilbertus's influence was simply due to the pres ence of his work in the region. If we attempt to ascertain where enamelers' workshops might have been established in Saxony during the period of Henry the Lion, Hildesheim, rather than Brunswick, would offer the clearest evidence, as we shall see. Though small enamel plaques might be cast and ornamented in different geographical locations by the same craftsman, it stands to reason that centralized workshops did exist to house the special kiln and tools for fine metalworking. Objects, on the other hand, could easily be transported. As far as the primary material - metal - is concerned, neither Hildesheim nor Brunswick owned mines. The sole known min ing center of any importance in twelfth-century Saxony is the great Rammelsberg under the jurisdiction of imperial Goslar. 67</page><page sequence="67">Figure 75.

Yet no records suggest that Goslar witnessed any artistic activity in this field outside of a tradition of technical mastery in casting which in the previous century had led to the making of the solid but rather crude so-called Krodo Altar, ac tually a large and uncomfortable imperial throne.48 There had undoubtedly been some earlier pre-Mosan style champlevM enameling activity in Lower Saxony in the first years of the twelfth century- the principles of the technique were not ............. novel after all. A group of colorful caskets - including an ex ample in the Hildesheim Cathedral Treasury (Figure 77), another in the Guelph Treasure (Figure 78), and a third even more striking specimen in Cleveland (Color Plate xi)- have often been said to hail from Denmark, apparently on the sole basis that another example is in Copenhagen. These boxes, how ever, should very probably be assigned to a center in Lower Sax ony such as Hildesheim. Here metalwork was an active craft, as the great Shrine ofSt. Godehard (Figure 79) of ca. 1132 clearly exemplifies.49 While displaying rudimentary techniques and still tied to cloisonne in their effect, these early champleve caskets are appealing for their sharp colors and flat, angular forms clear 68</page><page sequence="68">Figure 77.

Shortly after 1150, the making of champleve enamel increased markedly in Saxony with the fashioning of a considerable number of reliquaries, portable altars, and bookcovers. If many were to enrich the Treasure of the Guelphs, others were ordered by ecclesiastics and institutions of Hildesheim, such a tradi tional patronage not being readily apparent in Brunswick or other Saxon centers. With an increase in the number of plaques produced, technical refinements took place, while individual ity of style also became more apparent. In the treasury of Hildesheim Cathedral are six unusually large champleve enamel plaques (Figure 81) recorded to have decorated the frame (of which parts of the wood core were still in existence in the nine teenth century) of a twelfth-century altar antependium of the cathedral. Produced in the 1150s, these plaques with scenes from the life of Christ have reserved figures which are more firmly drawn with their rounded forms, than those in the light sketch 70</page><page sequence="70">Figure 81.

Both the more systematically organized folds and the full faces with carefully delineated hair and beards seem influenced by Mosan art (Figures 69-71), though perhaps through more linear Rhenish intermediaries. The Hildesheim Treasury plaques, however, show one characteristic typical of Eilbertus's altar and of subsequent "Hildesheim" enamels: in ternal rectangular frames in two colors separated by a thin white line. 50 The tradition of the Eilbertus altar can be traced in a group of enamels, from Lower Saxony, some of which are part of the Guelph Treasure, particularly two shrines: the Portable Altar of the Four Cardinal Virtues (Figures 82-83) and the much damaged St. Walpurgis Shrine (Figures 84-85).5 On the top of the PortableA Itar oftheFour Cardinal Virtues (Figure 82), datable to the middle to late 1150s, is a circular porphyry stone surrounded by a gilt-copper plaque. This plaque has a par ticularly appealing border stamped (that is, hammered over a die) with a palmette motif and engraved with the figures of the evangelists. At either side are two plaques each with the figures of a Cardinal Virtue in full enamel with only the heads and hands as well as the shield of Fortitude in reserved gilt-metal. The drawing of these figures, somewhat clumsy in their pro portions and clad in unrhythmic draperies, is comparatively</page><page sequence="73">Figure 86.

Broad areas of uniform enamel are juxtaposed in a manner which actually seems to hark back to the technique used in the earlier sharp-colored caskets (Color Plate xi, Figures 77-78) with their fully enameled figures. In contradistinction, the enameled plaques on the back of the PortableAltar of the Four Cardinal Virtues (Figure 83) representing the seated Virgin between the four Evangelists, with involved drapery folds and the upper horizontal inscriptions identifying the figures - recall in a striking manner the style of the Eilbertus altar. Also reminiscent of this altar is the swirling embossed gilt-metal design on the beveled edges. The St. WalpurgisShrine (Figures 84-85) is undoubtedly re lated to the Portable Altar of the Four Cardinal Virtues. One close element between the two, for example, is again the band with engraved palmettes decorating the base of the shrine; it vividly echoes the embossed elements around the porphyry stone of the probably earlier altar. The St. Walpurgis Shrine reflects two Hildesheim productions. First, its construction and extended size recall the shape of the Shrine of St. Godehard (Figure 79). Second, the naturalistic, soft approach to figure drawing is closely related to a somewhat earlier "portable altar stone" with its series of gilt-copper figures (Figure 86) enfram ing the central porphyry and containing relics particularly venerated in Hildesheim.52 The similar treatment of forms is emphasized in the St. Walpurgis Shrine by the series of small parallel folds of the drapery in the enamel plaques and by the two lateral engraved copper gables with the Enthroned Christ and the Crucifixion (Figure 85), the latter being infused with a quiet sense of drama. The St. Walpurgis Shrine is also of interest from a technical viewpoint. The six apertures in the gable (Figure 84) once in cluded thin gilt-copper plaques embossed with a figure, and below (Figure 85) a series of similar reliefs originally alternated with the enamels. While nearly all the metal has disappeared, some of the areas still show the support for the embossed work which is clearly a compound of wax and resin. This substance, judging from other metalwork objects of the period, was stand ardly used as filler in order to prevent the embossed works from being easily crushed. The use of wooden cores as support for the embossed figures on Countess Gertrude's portable altar, which provided a stronger and more durable base, confirms the obvious greater care in the conception of that shrine. If the St. Walpurgis Shrine may be related to the Portable Altar ofthe Four Cardinal Virtues on the one hand, it can also be compared for the style of its figures to the larger gilt-bronze plaque (Figure 87) with the figure of Christ treading on the beasts 74</page><page sequence="74">Figure 87.

This volume is also undoubtedly con nected with Hildesheim since it was copied there by the monk Ratmannus of the Abbey of St. Michael. The figure of Christ is subtly drawn with a series of well-emphasized v-folds in the freely flowing, though not abundant, drapery. The style of the Ratmann Sacramentary in turn relates to two other pieces. The first is the cover (Figure 88) of the so-called Gospels of Tegern see, a volume now in Trier but which is recorded to have been in the Church of St. Godehard of Hildesheim until 1799. Its Figure 88. Binding of Gospels of Tegernsee. Ivory plaque, champleve enamel, gilt-bronze, and gems, 13-13/16 x 9-13/16 inches (35 x 25 cm.). Germany, Lower Saxony, Hildesheim, ca. 1175.

The enamels flanking the sides of this portable altar are in a somewhat different style with sharp ly delineated puppet-like figures, closely allied to those of some of the contemporary Colognese productions (Color Plate xII 75</page><page sequence="75">Figure 89.

The narrow strips of enamel on the plinths with white, *i; 9 jRs 3` yellow, and blue quatrefoil designs may suggest another ele ment of Colognese influence since they are in the cloisonne * technique and the use of the two enamelings is a characteristic found in the shrines made in the immediate circle of Eilbertus. The combination of cloisonne and champleve, if uncommon in Hildesheim metalwork is, nonetheless, also distinctive to the slightly earlier Portable Altar of the Four Cardinal Virtues. Still connected to the St. Walpurgis Shrine, but with a more . i.: .......fluid drawing style and a softer effect of volume again due, it seems, to the influence of Cologne (Figure 76), is the plaque with the bust-length figure of St. Matthew, sole remaining dec oration of a beechwood casket once in the Guelph Treasure and now in Brunswick. The more ambitious compositions of three plaques depicting the Crucifixion connected stylistically to the St. Matthew enamel further suggest a renewal of influences from the Mosan region, particularly from Stavelot, as well as from Cologne. These plaques are now in Paris (Figure 90), Trier (Figure 91), and Cleveland (Color Plate XIIF, Figure 92).54 The Crucifixion scene as it appears on one of the gables of the St. Walpurgis Shrine (Figure 85) might have stood as distant model, but a new modus operandi is now evident. The first (Figure 90) of the three plaques, with a rounded top - once part of a reliquary now in the Musee du Cinquan tenaire in Brussels- is the crispest in design. It is also probably the earliest, judging from the many small supporting pin-like elements within the enamel fields left to securely hold the poured enamel (further technical refinements in enameling processes eventually made these pins unneccessary). The crucified Christ, as he dies on the Cross before his grieving mother and favorite disciple, sheds his blood into the chalice of his spouse Ecclesia. She is the crowned Church holding the long staff with the cross and the pennant of Victory, clear symbol of the Redemption. On his left, a blindfolded figure, whose cap falls as she gestures emphatically and strides away, is Synagogue, symbolizing those who knowingly refuse the evidence of Christ's godliness and sacrifice. The ecclesiastic donor (unless he be the enameler) is portrayed prostrated under the cross. Apprehensively looking up, his broad-featured face nearly approaches a caricature. The figures, reserved in gilt-copper with the inclusion of some white enamel, are outlined against a cobalt blue background, while the cross and ground line are a deep green. The rich iconography flowing with narrative verve, as well as the figural style with its rather soft forms and accidental folds defined by reserved figures, can clearly be related to Mosan enamels such as the Por table Altarfrom Stavelot Abbey (Figure 93), whose involved 78</page><page sequence="78">Figure 94. Henry II Flanked by Cunigonde and the Monk Weland (detail of Reliquary ofHenry II). Gilt-bronze and champleve enamel, H. of quadrilobe: 4-3/4 inches (12 cm.).

Paris, Musee du Louvre. compositions also include prominent representations of Ec clesia and Synagogue.55 Yet major elements suggest Hildesheim for the Paris plaque, with its broad forms, rather stubby pro portions, more detailed folds, and lack of spatial efffects. Important as concurring evidence for a Hildesheim origin of the Paris enamel is the plaque incorporated in the cover (Figure 91) of a gospel book now in the Trier Cathedral Treasury but which, as in the case of the Tegernsee Gospels, is also firmly recorded as having been in the Church of St. Godehard of Hildesheim until 1799. The field of this second plaque is divided into three registers. The central one reproduces, in a nearly iden tical though less bold and rhythmic fashion, the same dramatic Crucifixion scene, suggesting that the Paris composition served as its example. While intent on conveying some modeling, the drawing in the second plaque has become relatively linear, more closely akin to that of the enamels on the St. WalpurgisShrine. A rectangular plaque with the same Crucifixion (Figure 92) enframed by large lobed scenes, one depicting the sacrifice of Abel, the other that of Abraham, forms the lid of a box now in Cleveland (Color Plate xII F). The hues are slightly lighter in shade than those of the plaque (Figure 90) in Paris though they are not as luminescent in quality. The box - which might conceivably be referred to as a pyx, but by no means as a por table altar as has been suggested (it never contained a con secrated stone)- is highly unusual in its shape for this period. Also of note is the fact that the large plaque simply rests unse cured on the walls of the box; the small hooks, probably not original elements, at the end of each lobe of the plaque serve no purpose as the object now stands. Similarly uncommon are the curving end plaques along the sides of the "pyx." All four narrow side elements, as in the case of the PortableA Itar ofthe Four Cardinal Virtues and that ofA braham andMelchizedek, are in the cloisonne technique bearing a pattern of large diamonds in the same shades of blue and green as on the crown ing plaque. Two styles of drawing as well as sources of inspira tion are involved in the main plaque of the Cleveland "pyx." The central scene - if it indeed depends on the enamel from the Gospels of St. Godehard (Figure 91), as it would appear - is relatively heavy, angular, and somewhat inarticulate in con tours, while some details are summarized (falling crown of Synagogue), exaggerated (Ecclesia's staff, gushing blood of Christ), or misunderstood (Virgin's gesture, placement of Christ's feet). The scenes in the lobed areas, especially the sacrifice of Isaac, seem freely borrowed from the PortableAl tar with Abraham and Melchizedek (Figure 89) both in terms of their iconography and more freely flowing forms. Nonetheless, the whole plaque was certainly executed by one hand; witness such a particular detail as the choppy ground line with small treacherous cavities carried through each of the three fields. Such preliminary observations might suggest that the "pyx" is a transitional piece and that a more thorough reassessment of its components is necessary. A third group of enamels, which seems to be a more refined outcome both of the St. Walpurgis Shrine and the Paris-Trier Crucifixion plaques, is represented by the Reliquary of Henry II(Figure 94) and by a series of ten small rectangular gilt-copper plaques with rounded tops, each with a seated gesticulating prophet (Color Plates XII A-D, Figures 95-97).56 These are the crowning achievement of twelfth-century Lower Saxony enamels.

The Reliquary of Henry II (Figure 94) is composed of ad dorsed quatrefoil enamels mounted on an enameled base car ried on three gilt-bronze feet. On the obverse surrounding Christ appear three kings in bust-length: SS. Oswald and Sigismund, kings of Northumbria, and "EVGEVS" (probably Owain of Scotland). On the reverse quatrefoil the saintly emperor (canonized in 1152), solemn and hieratic in his full regalia, is shown with his wife Cunigonde (not represented as a saint as she was canonized only in 1200) in bust-length on his right. Near ly as unassured as his brother on the Paris Crucifixion plaque, an older monk, represented in reduced scale, humbly presents to our view a conceptual rendering of the reliquary echoing the shape of the imperial orb. An inscription in niello behind the bent figure identifies the cleric as "Weland." While he is other wise unknown to us, he might be the donor or the goldsmith. Since the art historian Georg Swarzenski's writings in 1932, this aristocratic reliquary has been connected with the patronage of Henry the Lion, who would have seen in his eleventh-century namesake, also of Swabian ancestry and a great patron of the arts, the embodiment of his own personal ambitions.57 Although there is no indication on the reliquary substantiating this hypothesis, it is a very tempting one which would in turn suggest that Weland was not the donor but indeed the goldsmith who fashioned the object. Historically as well as artistically, the work seems to be an appropriate ducal commission, partic ularly during the decade 1185-1195 when Henry returned to Brunswick from England after his fall from power and stressed his ties to the English throne, perhaps to compensate for his vanished dukedoms, a loss which he never accepted. This also seems to be the time when the Lion ordered his gospel book in which two miniatures (Figure 33) clearly emphasize this same compensating imagery. OPPOSITE LEFT Figure 97. Prophet Ezekiel.

The enamel plaques of the Henry II reliquary (Figure 94) are particularly fluid in style with small drapery folds either con verging on the diagonal or forming rounded contours to sug gest three-dimensional effects. A very similar treatment of forms, though less defined, is apparent in some English manu scripts and enamels of the 1170-1180s; for example, in a miniature of the seated Christ (Figure 98) likely to have been produced at the Abbey of Ramsey and a series of plaques (Figure 99) that have been connected with Winchester.58 ( f I., d~ 42 -\ -itr~ -q1t~( - 99) that have been connected with Winchester.58 81</page><page sequence="81">Figure 100.

Epernay, Bibliotheque municipale, ms. 1, folio 60v. Of the ten Lower Saxony plaques with prophets, four are in Cleveland (Color Plate XII A-D), two in a private collection in Switzerland, and one in each of the following cities: Cologne (Figure 95), Dijon (Figure 96), Leningrad, and Diisseldorf (Figure 97). They obviously once belonged on a reliquary such as the St. Walpurgis Shrine. This is made all the more apparent by the letter marks incised on the back of each plaque which served to indicate their placement. The style of these enamels, though showing a somewhat mannered stage, is in essence the same as that of the Henry II reliquary, but the drapery folds now swirl energetically as if controlled by an intense life of their own. This nervous agitation nearly suggests the experiments of the Reims School of Carolingian times, as best represented in the series of seated evangelists (Figure 100) in the famous gospel book made for Archbishop Ebbo by the Utrecht Psalter Workshop, though in fact it is probably more simply a man nered reflection of Byzantine art of the Comnenian period (Figure 131), whose modes, as we will find, deeply influenced contemporary minature painting and early thirteenth-century sculpture of northwestern Germany. In conclusion, it is evident from the preceding paragraphs that enamelers who produced plaques in the style we call "Hil desheim" were not working under the rigid rules of a single workshop; each experienced the influence of different models -probably both simultaneously and in quick succession. Shortly before 1200 there is an abrupt cessation in the produc tion. The group that had executed many of the finest shrines of the Guelph Treasure was perhaps disbanded at the death of Henry the Lion or following some political upheaval. We do not know. When a large and particularly venerated relic was obtained, it was not uncommon in Romanesque times to make a shrine for it reproducing the shape of the memento but in a state ad vivum. In this manner, the receptacle became a tangible representa tion that could be held up before the faithful. Such are the five arm reliquaries of the Guelph Treasure dating to the time of Henry the Lion. As in the case of the St. Blaise arm (Figure 29), they are constructed of a carved wooden core over which sheets of silver have been carefully modeled. Distinctive to these arm reliquaries, however, is a new aesthetic: the limb has become more graceful and is clothed in a vestment usually represented in gilt-silver with delicate die-stamped borders rather than with cabochons and filigree.

One of our principal historical sources, the abbot of St. Giles in Brunswick, recorded through Arnold von Liibeck's Chronicle the presence of arm relics among the important mementos brought back by Henry the Lion from the Holy Land and Con stantinople in 1173. The duke, it would appear, had some en shrined with no delay and others later on when the reconstruc tion of the Church of St. Blaise was well under way. The Arm Reliquary of the Apostles (Color Plates xiv-xvIII), however, appears to have been made during the very last years of the Lion's life. Figure 102. Arm Reliquary of St. Innocent.

The earliest known pieces attributable to the goldsmiths re sponsible for the St. Oswald reliquary are probably two chalices made for political allies of Henry the Lion.60 Most prominent among them is the example (Figure 108) executed with its paten - the plate designed to hold the bread of the Eucharist - for Count Berthold iII of Andechs (1148-1184), who is named in the inscription on the rim of the foot. The count, who is I' i recorded to have frequently been very useful to Henry the Lion in patching up quarrels with his enemies, gave the chalice to Wilten Abbey. Fifteen Old Testament scenes are represented in medallions on the foot of the chalice, while on the cup itself appear eighteen from the New Testament. All are on a back ground of the characteristic nielloed spiral decoration. Highly important among Guelph Treasure objects is the "Paten of St. Bernward" now in Cleveland (Front Cover and Color Plate xIII), another product of the St. Oswald Reliquary Workshop. Probably made for the Treasury of St. Blaise at the . . . commission of Henry the Lion,6 it was mounted two centuries i later in a Gothic monstrance as if it actually were a remain of " the saint's body.

A Latin inscription on the exterior rim emphasizes its intended function: "The bread which is broken in me is the body [of Christ]: he shall live eternally he that receives it in faith." In the central field Christ is shown seated upon the rainbow of the Covenant, arms outstretched; a Latin inscription surround ing the image didactically emphasizes its promise of salvation: "Be witness! You have been redeemed by His death." Medallion like with its strong niello band, the central field is surrounded by acanthus shoots and by the symbols of the evangelists alter nating with representations of the Four Cardinal Virtues, all within a series of lobes and on a background of the typical spiral decoration. Because of its association with the saint, the paten was greatly _'_ '~ revered and was mounted in the late fourteenth century in its present monstrance flanked by turrets, and surmounted by a triangular gable bearing the Latin inscription "The Sign of the Lord," containing two slivers of the True Cross protected by plaques of rock crystal. Eight small bags of identified relics l / ::~ 0 7 _ \ \ wrapped in alternating red and green silk are set on the reverse of the paten (Figure 109) and are visible through another pro tective rock crystal plaque. An inscription on a horizontal band of vellum attributes the making of the paten to St. Bernward (ISTA[M] PATENA[M] FECIT S[ANCTUS] BERWARDUS). That the .................. : object was actually fashioned by the saint (who died in 1022) might be possible, but then it would have been left strangely unadorned, for its decoration clearly dates from over a century and a half later. The fragments of the True Cross set above the paten might be there in order to reinforce the attribution of its making to Bernward, since it was always well known that the saintly bishop received a particle of this most distinguished relic ..

Irregardless of the ac tual location of the workshop in Saxony, be it Hildesheim or the court of Brunswick, the duke may well have been instrumen tal in its activity more than in that of any other workshop. The English connection with the spiral niello designs, although it cannot be blown to a full relationship, should perhaps not be overlooked, nor should the free drawing of the figures which recalls, for example, the Virtues and Vices on the Troyes Casket, an English enameled work of about 1170.63 Particularly striking among objects of the Guelph Treasure dating from Henry the Lion's time or perhaps to the beginning years of his son's rule, is an arm reliquary (Color Plates xiv xvIII) in Cleveland.64 The absence of the closing plaque at the base may deprive us of an inscription such as that on the arms of SS. Theodore and Innocent. In the silver capsula, rolled in linen which is tightly jammed in the cavity (Figure 111), might very well be relics of the apostles, judging from the very prom inently displayed chased figures of Christ and his disciples at the base and cuff of the sleeve of the object (Color Plates xvi xvini). The shrine would then have been made to hold some of the relics which the chronicler refers to unspecifically as "brachia apostolorum plura." This arm reliquary, however, did not belong to the Treasury of St. Blaise until the sixteenth century; historical evidence would suggest that it had been originally presented by the Lion to a second foundation of which his family had been the major benefactor since 1079, the Monastery of St. Cyriacus, built east of Brunswick on a hill near the Oker.65 The raised hand, not quite life-size (Color Plates xiv-xv), is more subtly modeled than that of any of the other arm reli quaries in the Guelph Treasure. The extended arm is clothed with a finely woven silk-like garment forming a series of tight ripples and ending at the wrist with a braid of delicately stamped acanthus leaves vividly recalling the border surrounding the stone of the PortableAltar oftheFour Cardinal Virtues (Figure 82). Over the chemise is the sleeve of a rich ecclesiastical vest ment, with cascading diagonal v-folds that flow much more T Iju Figure 110. Clasp from the Puiset Bible.

The effect is but slightly marred by the damages which the shrine has incur red from being carried in countless processions and from fre quent unskilled restorations. Along the upright inside edge of the sleeve is a series of delicate jewel-like champleve enamel plaques (Color Plate xvII) in a coloristic palette of dark and pale blue, turquoise, green, and yellow, forming symmetrical floral motifs to my knowledge encountered in Lower Saxony only in some of the nielloed plaques at the base of theArm Reli quary of St. Lawrence (Figure 105). The outer garment is essen tially delineated by two striking borders of large medallions (Color Plates xvi-xvIII) in which the embossed bust-length figures, each with an individualized head, also adopt a distinct pose. Apart from Christ, with his cruciform halo, and Peter, holding the key, however, none can be identified. The handling of draperies with naturalistically rendered folds and the free movement of the figures stylistically confirm a very late twelfth century development of Lower Saxony art. The sophisticated beading outlining the semicircular spaces in addition to the sur rounding elements - the convoluted tendrils, luxuriant foliage, and admirably stylized grapes, probably an eclectic Byzantine reminiscence - as well as the general soft effect of forms on the whole arm, are equally telling. The only related objects we know of are the bejeweled gilt silver cross (Figure 112) with embossed medallions, documented as having been given by Henry to the Church of the Holy Cross at Hildesheim before his death, and the outer silver frame pro duced in Lower Saxony for the Portable Altar in Tablet Form (Figure 63) of the Guelph Treasure. Though to our knowledge unequaled among metalwork objects of the period, such out standing pieces became models for monumental Saxon sculp ture which until around 1200 was in fact very limited in number. The relief figures in the tympanum of St. Godehard (Figure 113) at Hildesheim and those of the choir screen (Figure 114) of the Liebfrauenkirche in Halberstadt, with the rich effect of their free flowing garments and new vitality in the characterization of physiognomies, are primary examples of sculptures which are seemingly enlarged versions of particularly high quality metalwork.66 It is evident that bronze casting in Saxony owed much to Hildesheim, though Magdeburg and Goslar, and perhaps even Brunswick, also later produced large bronzes.

The style of these smaller bronzes considered to have been produced in the Hildesheim-Brunswick axis is marked by simple flowing forms and a general restraint in the ornamentation, in contradistinction to Colognese works, as we shall see. Two late twelfth- or early thirteenth-century non-Guelph Treasure gilt-bronze objects in The Cleveland Museum of Art seem particularly appealing examples of this Saxon produc tion. The first is an altar cross (Color Plate XIX) which reflects, as do a number of other examples produced in the region, the Cross of Bishop Bernward (Figure 117) in its general canons and in the suffering face of Christ full of pathos and dignity. Closer in time to the Cleveland cross are two other gilt-bronze crucifixes (Figues 118-119) in the Hildesheim Treasury, one of which also rests on an involved base with an ornamentation of twisting and overlappng acanthus leaves on four low feet.68 Distinctive of the Cleveland cross decoration are the large birds Figure 115.

Twisting their heads over branches, they echo those creatures (Figure 116) bound within the leaves of the monumental Brunswick candelabrum. The second Cleveland object (Color Plate xx) is fashioned like a Byzantine central-plan church with four main roofs, a lantern roof crowned by a turret, and semi-circular apses, the whole resting on four dragon-shaped feet. A nearly identical object in Berlin (Figure 120) has been proposed as its model, but the argument lacks conviction; of the two, Cleveland's is of higher aesthetic quality with more felicitous proportions and a greater finish in the chiseling.69 Both objects are devoid of religious symbolism with their decoration of florid acanthus and masonry courses. Although they have been considered as reliquary bases for crosses like the one in Hildesheim (Figure 118), the round tower crowning each of the fanciful construc tions lacks a slot into which a cross prong would fit, thus inval idating that hypothesis. In addition, relics which are always rendered inaccessible could have been easily withdrawn from these structures since at least one of the four hinged apsidal doors, secured only with a hook, can be lowered at will.

Such recep tacles might have been used to burn dried flower petals or leaves valued for their fragrance or purificatory properties. They were not censers as there are no holes or hooks for attaching chains. First devised in Byzantine art (Figure 121), these burners are intended to recall, by their shape, the great temple that, accord ing to textual sources, David had built in Jerusalem. They are related by their technique as well as their symbolism to those elaborate richly gilded metal chandeliers, nine of which are credited to the supervision of Bernward and his successors to the see of Hildesheim.70 Referred to as coronas, those large (ap proximately five feet wide), wheel-shaped structures were fashioned as a ring of fortified walls interspersed with twelve gates, clear visual translation of the heavenly Jerusalem as it is envisioned in the sacred texts. If in his patronage Henry the Lion generally seems to have drawn on talents in his own territories, he also appears to have prevailed on a workshop in distant Cologne to produce a ma jor piece of the Guelph Treasure. This is the Dome Reliquary in the shape of a church on a Greek cross plan and covered by a ribbed cupola (Figure 122), now in Berlin.71 The design of the two-storied structure, more than in the case of the perfume burners, could hardly have been conceived without a familiarity with Byzantine architectural forms, even if it is primarily meant to evoke the so-called Omar Mosque in Jerusalem believed in the Middle Ages to have once been the Temple of Solomon. Ac cording to the 1482 inventory, the reliquary held the skull of St. Gregory of Nazianzus which Henry the Lion acquired in Constantinople; apart from this information, there is no in dication on the shrine itself that it was ordered or purchased for this purpose. The dome of the Berlin shrine is made of champleve enamel in coloristic foliate patterns. Enameled columns with large Cor inthian capitals in cast gilt-bronze support the arcades of the lower part. The figured decoration is not made of precious metal but of carved walrus ivory which was readily imported from Scandinavia into Cologne, a bustling trading center. (The com merical ties between the Rhineland and the Norse Peninsula through natural waterways, made walrus ivory easily available, replacing the more difficult to find elephant tusk.) Beneath the arcades of the Berlin shrine, against panels of yet differently patterned enamels, are eight pairs of prophets framing each of the four facades bearing a plaque with scenes from the life of Christ in shallow relief against a shell motif background as in 96</page><page sequence="96">Color Plate xx.

Traditionally considered as having been commissioned by Henry the Lion, this reliquary, with the Mosan-like floral enamel opulence of its ribbed dome, would speak for a dating of no earlier than the late 1180s. Its Colognese origin is evidenced by its relationship to such late twelfth-century productions from Cologne as the Shrine ofSt. Aetherius (Cologne, Church of St. Ursula), while the colors and style of the floral and geometric al enamels, with their somewhat mechanical contours, evoke the work of the Gregorius Master (Figure 75).72 This exquisite shrine is not unique; another (Figure 123), very closely related in shape, materials, techniques, and iconography, was once at the Convent of Eltenberg on the German/Dutch border and is now in London. It was made by the workshop that produced the enamel Shrine of St. Maurinus in the Colognese Church of St. Pantaleon and is about three times the size of the Figure 123.

Although it has been pro posed that the Eltenberg reliquary served as the model for the Guelph shrine, in our opinion the more obvious, sparkling quali ty of originality of the Berlin shrine, in contradistinction to a less precise and drier workmanship on the one in London, alone would firmly suggest that the reverse is more likely to be true. 73 The Cleveland Museum owns a Colognese portable altar (Figure 124), which is nearly contemporary to the Victoria and Albert Dome Reliquary. The decoration of the longer sides is composed of the usual series of apostles, while the seated Virgin between the Magi and Christ the Judge between the four sym bols of the Evangelists appear on the shorter sides.7 4 The carv ings on this portable altar are also made from walrus ivory and reveal typical Colognese workmanship as well as taste for highly decorative surfaces with no contrasting plain areas. Each figure is divided by a panel of cloisonne enamel work in a uniform geometric and stylized floral design. A stylistic analogy can be made between the rather inarticulate figures with oversized faces and sharp profiles and clothed in panel drapery, and the Virgin with standing saints on the larger carved stone relief (Figure 125) of about 1175-1180 in Braunweiler, the site of a Benedic tine abbey which evidently directed its major commissions to nearby Cologne.

CMA 31.65 When twelfth-century princes commissioned manuscripts, they still called primarily for gospels, as had their forebears. Famous among codices of the period is the gospel book made on order of Henry the Lion and Matilda Plantagenet. In 1983 the volume was sold at a well-publicized auction and is now deposited at the Herzog August-Bibliothek in Wolfenbiittel. The large vol ume with its 226 leaves had been commissioned about 1185 for the express purpose of being given to the Church of St. Blaise, and in all likelihood it was presented when the altar with the bronze columns (Figure 115) was dedicated by the duchess to the Virgin Mary in 1188.75 A full miniature in the volume (Figure 126) represents Henry effortlessly supporting the thick codex with one hand and conspicuously offering it to the Virgin through the intercession of St. Blaise as if it should unques tionably guarantee his salvation. On the right is the regal Matilda, officially posed (she may well have paid for the volume) with her right hand held by the goodly St. Giles. Judging from its representation in this miniature, the manuscript then had a rich binding including some goldsmith work in the shape of a large cross. The actual volume is quite unusual among con temporary codices, not only because of its forty-one full-page elaborate mosaic-like minatures with their intense colors and highly ornamental construction, but also on account of its layout including the spectacular use of gold uncial letters on purple-tinted vellum, harking back to the tradition of Caro lingian luxury volumes which in turn is traceable to classical antiquity. The use of gold on purple had been partially revived in Germany before Henry's time, as seen, for example, in the marriage contract of Empress Theophanu in 972 in the Nieder sachisches Staatsarchiv in Wolfenbiittel and in the DoubleLeaf from a Roman Gradual (Figure 127) of about 980 now in the Cleveland Museum. Never in Romanesque times, however, was it employed to such an extent and in so elaborate a volume.76 The dedicatory page of the Gospels of Henry the Lion not only records the virtues of the duke but also the making of the manuscript at Helmarshausen Abbey by the monk Herimann during the abbacy of Conrad (ca. 1168-1189). As such, it is a particularly important documentary record of the duke's pa tronage and also provides the basis for localizing and attributing all other contemporary Helmarshausen books. A prosperous Benedictine house founded in 997, the Abbey of Helmarshausen (Figure 128), of which only scanty ruins re main, stood near Kassel, a good sixty miles southwest of Bruns wick. It was undoubtedly a chief artistic center of twelfth century northwestern Germany. Metalwork had been its greatest output, as underlined by the portable altar made there by Roger 101</page><page sequence="101">Figure 126. Virgin and Child in a Mandorla Surrounded by SS.

The monk Theophilus, in his manual of craftsmanship On DiversA rts, in fact devotes a few paragraphs to the technique of painting on vellum as it was ap parently practiced at Helmarshausen. Nineteen known manuscripts are securely attributed to Hel marshausen, including eleven gospels, two psalters, one sacra mentary, two volumes of the lives of saints, and two undecorat ed codices. Many of those volumes were produced for members of sister institutions (Abdinghof, Corvey, Helmstedt, Hersfeld, Gnesen, Lippoldsberg, and Lund).77 The only dated volume is a gospel book of 1194 now in the Wolfenbiittel Library. One of the earliest volumes known is a gospel book which might have been made about 1130. It is a small codex with canon tables and a representation of each of the gospel writers. These evangelists (Figure 129)- with their patterned hair, mask-like faces, contrived, nearly dancing poses, and highly decorative metal-like draperies - seem to be direct descendants of the effer vescent twisting apostles on Heinrich von Werl's portable altar (Figure 55). The extremely ornamented forms, down to minute details, and the somewhat frozen looks of the figures indeed seem to depend to a large extent on models drawn from metal work. The seated authors in another gospel book of a some what later date (Figure 130) in fact appear as if presiding with in the ends (Figure 79) of a metal shrine.

Miraculously, the shiny surfaces of the Helmarshausen manuscripts seem to have hardly lost any of their glimmer, a technical feat which should no doubt be seen as an application of the abbey's wide metallurgical knowledge.

The effects of such an influence are already perceptible in the gospel book of about 1150 in Uppsala (Figure 132), but atttained their full impact in the Helmstedt Gospels dated 1194 (Figure 133), with greater expressive and dramatic movements.78 Besides the Gospels of Henry theLion, Helmarshausen pro duced at least two other manuscripts for lay commissions. These are small psalters, probably dating from the late 1370s or 1380s, one in the Walters Art Gallery and the other in London. They zi R are also generally held to be Henry's commissions. The stand ing woman (Figure 134) who prominently occupies the entire field on the first illuminated folio in the Walters's volume has been identified as Matilda Plantagenet by Martin Gosebruch on account of the strong resemblance of pose and costume with the duchess as she appears in the gospels ordered for St. Blaise (Figure 33), thus challenging the hypothesis of Goldschmidt who suggested she is the duke's daughter Gertrude, who mar ried the crown prince of Denmark. The man and woman at the foot of the cross (Figure 135) in the fragmentary volume at the British Library have been held to be Henry and Matilda. Though these identifications might conceivably be on the mark, they are not substantiated by inscriptions or iconographic details such as the many precise ones overrunnin g the gospels which such as the many precise ones overrunning the gospels which 106</page><page sequence="106">Figure 132.

It is a volume of 195 folios held in a rich binding of goldsmith work (Figure 136). The cover is also probably a Helmarshausen product, the icon ographic forms of its signs of the evangelists and its filigree deriv ing from an early example (Figure 137) widely held to be the work of the monk Roger.80 The manuscript itself is a late twelfth-century production which can stylistically be dated fair ly precisely to the time between the completion of the gospels 109</page><page sequence="109">Figure 138.

The topological significance of the miniature and the clear delight in juggling a variety of textual quotations suggest a great familiarity by the cleric who designed the program and probably also the layout of the miniature with the scriptures, the texts of the Church Fathers (particularly St. Augustine), and con temporary theologians and mystics such as Richard of Saint Victor. On the verso (Color Plate xxiv) of the Cleveland folio in the large capital letter L (for "Liber") the Evangelist Matthew emerges from a medallion and looks sternly past our world. He holds a scroll with an inscription which in English would read: "Christ is the true God and the true man." The color scheme juxtaposing sharp and pastel tonalities - blues, greens, reds, grays, beiges, and white, with gold acanthus and lettering - is nearly the same as that of the Gospels of Henry the Lion, though here more vivid. Historiated initials of this kind repre sent one of the most favored forms of manuscript decoration of the Romanesque period. Elaborate ornamental initials at the beginning of important sections of text had been an artistic device used in the North ever since the great period of Hiberno Saxon illumination, and figural elements had been added soon after contact with the Mediterranean world had been established. The German historian Ekkehard Kriger in his recent study of the scriptorium of Helmarshausen considers that the Trier volume was written by the very scribe who wrote the Gospels ofHenry the Lion, namely the monk Herimann. Almost noth ing is known about Herimann apart from the appearance of his name in the duke's gospels and on a list of contemporary Helmarshausen monks.82 Because of its wide differences with the Gospels ofHenry theLion, the decoration of the Trier gos pels can by no means be attributed solely to Herimann. In fact it reveals itself as the collective enterprise of a workshop with two main masters. One is indeed very probably Herimann him self, active in the layout of the volume and in devising the com position of most miniatures. He or his best pupil also painted the majority of the ornamental gold initials characteristically outlined with the saffron color also found delineating figures in the Gospels of Henry the Lion. The second artist of the Trier gospels might be dubbed the "Byzantinizing Master" for he was particularly conversant with late Comnenian modes (Figure 131). This is evident in his sym 112</page><page sequence="112">BELOW Figure 143. Lion Aquamanile. Brass, 10-1/4 x 10-1/16 inches (26 x 25.5 cm.).

The painter adapted this vocabulary and array of forms, however, to the more naturalistic German tendencies. At the same time he consciously moved away from the time-honored crowded background so typical of Helmars hausen manuscripts, as is made clearly apparent in the Last Judgment (Figure 142) of the Trier codex entirely of his hand, ?!/: " "' " ^ W^ _ /NS~kS,00 Off ffff f AyS X _ and even more so in the same scene (Figure 133) of the Helmstedt Gospels of 1194, a manuscript for which he was conceptually as well as physically responsible. This second artist was given the largest share in the decoration of the Trier volume which he in fact seems to have completed, often painting over some existing preparatory drawings by Herimann, constantly mak ing modifications to suit his own personal style with larger figures. It was not all that easy a procedure, and some elements, such as the Virgin in the Nativity, are fitted in rather than proper 113 0 02? o--f 0 Ad .; f 0 . . .~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~1</page><page sequence="113">ly integrated. When comparing the Last Judgment (Figure 133) with the Nativity (Color Plate XXIII) of the same codex, the faces of the figures in both works bear the imprint of the Byzan tinizing Master's style, whereas the bodies of the allegories con form to Romanesque canons as known in Herimann's oeuvre. The figures in the Nativity seem flat when contrasted to the more bulky and agile forms found in the Last Judgment. Compar ing details of garments from each miniature shows that the pic torial topography of the Nativity is governed by a more fluid and continuous approach to modeling with less emphasis on impasto contrasts. Already in such scenes as the Nativity or the Baptism of Christ (Figure 140), there is an obvious elimination of the chalky ground and a reduction in the layers of pigments which are so characteristic of the miniatures in Henry the Lion's gospels. The Cleveland leaf, therefore, though designed by Herimann, was painted by the Byzantinizing Master who ac commodates his figural painting to the flatter, less modulated color scheme of Herimann's tradition. Placing the Nativity page (Color Plate xxIII), once part of the Trier gospels, and the Gospels of Henry the Lion, side by side, shows the continuity of Herimann's ideas in the later manuscript. They are, however, now exposed to new criteria, especially in the facial renderings, as can be noted in the powerful image of the Evangelist Luke (Figure 139) set within the ornate golden framework of the in itial Q - certainly still of Herimann's conception - in the Trier gospels. Herimann thereby appears as the consecrated but ag ing head of the Helmarshausen workshop into which entered a younger painter of high artistic ability trained in a different and more progressive milieu. By 1194 the Byzantinizing artist had completed the decoration (Figure 133) of what seems to be the last known volume of the Helmarshausen School, in fusing a new dynamism into Herimann's constraints and replac ing the older master's spirit of horror vacui with open gold grounds. His style was continued in Lower Saxony in such a manuscript as Codex 3, produced around 1210, in the Halberstadt Cathedral Museum. The long series of important works dating from the time of Henry the Lion in the Guelph Treasure clearly emphasizes the vitality of artistic life of northwestern Germany in the twelfth century. They are related in a tapestry of technique, style, decora tion, and source, yet mediums by and large remain independent from one another. In no specific way though do they prove that workshops were actually established at the instigation of Henry the Lion and that some were active in the proximity of Dank warderode. Yet, a consistent thread running through them is the patronage of the duke who, in encouraging the rise of the mercantile class, must by extension have seen to the multiplica tion and well-being of craftsmen. Henry the Lion's commis sions with their relative degree of personal choice and involve ment, however, finally did not lead to the creation of a truly in digenous and cohesive style. Henry nonetheless did leave his mark on Saxon art in a variety of ways, as can be seen, for example, in a series of at least nine cast brass aquamanilia - water vessels used in the Middle Ages for washing hands - two of which dating to the first half of the thirteenth century, are in Cleveland (Color Plate xxI) and the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm (Figure 143). Their source of inspiration is clearly derived from the monumental lion (Figure 4) of 1166 with outstretched rear legs and characteristic ears cast as part of his voluminous mane spreading over the entire upper part of his body. These charming if modest offsprings are like ly to have been produced right in Brunswick from metal of the Rammelsberg mine at Goslar of which Henry the Lion's de scendants were now part owners.83 114</page><page sequence="114">CHAPTER IV A Time of Steady Growth: Thirteenth-Fifteenth Centuries Henry the Lion's son, who was chosen German king and became Holy Roman emperor in 1209 as Otto IV, is an ill-fated figure in German history. Lacking political acumen, he was pitted by the German electors against his cousin Frederick 11 Hohenstau fen, and was eventually forced to abdicate after much turmoil and the loss of a major battle against the French in 1214. He died tragically at Harzburg Castle, a short distance from Goslar, in May 1218. He had clung tenaciously to his imperial title, defending to the last his right to wear the crown and deman ding that he be buried in full imperial regalia. In his will he re quired his elder brother to retain at least momentarily not only the emblems of power but above all the most sacred imperial relics-fragments of the cross, the holy lance, the crown of thorns, and the tooth of St. John the Baptist - so powerfully did the possession of these objects symbolize for that age pro tection from heaven as well as supernatural authority. What role, if any, Duke Henry's son played in the formation of the Guelph Treasure is unclear. Before he died, the Lion had planned to place the Treasure in St. Blaise, but as the edifice was not completed by 1195, the objects were probably kept in the small chapel dedicated to SS. George and Gertrude within Dankwarderode and were not transferred to the collegiate un til 1218, only a few months before Otto's death. Their hasty removal at this time to the foundation church was obviously dictated by the great political insecurity of the moment. The document cursorily recording the presentation of the Guelph Treasure speaks of reliquaries "in our father's possession and in ours," perhaps suggesting that Otto himself might have com missioned some of them. Born at the court of his grandfather Henry 11 of England, Otto was thoroughly influenced by his mother's family, following in this aspect his father's example. Unquestionably he looked up in all ways to his cousin John Lackland and his court, despite their wavering support. Otto's coronation mantle enlivened with bold lions (Figure 144) is an opus anglicanum. He and his brothers Henry Count Palatine and Wilhelm of Winchester commissioned the double tomb of Henry the Lion and Matilda (Figure 3). That monument is clearly based on the tombs of Matilda's parents at Fontevrault, with naturalistic effigies imposing in their quiet authority. Yet their vivacity and their overly rich drapery speak in terms of a German idiom allied to the contemporary and striking sculpture of Bamberg Cathedral. Also due to the commission of Henry the Lion's sons are the mural paintings (Figure 2) of the apse and transept of St. Blaise.84 After 1218 Brunswick was ruled by Wilhelm of Winchester, so called for his birth at the site of the famous abbey during Figure 144.

Eight years later, the construction of the Burgkirche, as planned during Henry the Lion's lifetime, was finally completed. It was then newly consecrated with SS. John the Baptist, Blaise, and Thomas of Canterbury as patrons. After the death of Wilhelm's son Otto the Child in 1252, the alodial territories of Henry the Lion were divided into two separate, if related, dukedoms, that of Brunswick and that of Lineburg. Wilhelm's grandson Albrecht the Great became duke of Bruns wick and continued the main line. The repeated division of the Brunswick-Lineburg land between the various heirs of the line (the will of Albrecht the Great, for example, had to provide for three sons), was a decisive factor in the steadily waning power and diminishing wealth of the Guelph House. Nevertheless, numerous objects were added to the Treasure in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, surpass ing in number those of earlier periods. Yet it is with rare excep tion that these additions match from an artistic standpoint the importance of the Ottonian and Romanesque pieces. The House of Brunswick, though, continued in its role of protec tor and principal patron of the foundation that eventually became the Cathedral of St. Blaise. In northern Germany, transition to the Gothic style was late in coming, and in the thirteenth century Romanesque art simply took on a hybrid and baroque richness. Particularly striking among such "early Gothic" objects in the Treasure is the Bust Reliquary of St. Cosmas (Figure 145), rutilant in the shimmer of its metalic surfaces and having strong, flat, broad forms. The saint's military cap was once crowned by a crest and his lost gaze nearly betrays a barbaric mood, but details, such as the carefully combed gilt hair and the delicate embossed interlace motif of 116</page><page sequence="116">Figure 146.

The fourteenth century was unequivocally the second most important period for the Treasure. This was primarily due - and this point seems to have been little emphasized-to the benevolent patronage of Duke Otto the Mild (1318-1346), who saw to the general prosperity of Brunswick which under his rule became a center of the Hanseatic League. Otto the Mild ordered the addition (1322-1346) of the Gothic south aisle to the Cathedral of St. Blaise, where sculptures of him and his wife, Agnes of Brandenburg (Figure 146), were placed. Attentive, the duke gave and encouraged others to give to the Treasury of St. Blaise. At the same time he spared no efforts to see to the restora tion and enhancement of the valuable objects which had been the gifts of his ancestors, such as the two crosses (Color Plates I-III) and the portable altar of Countess Gertrude (Color Plates v-Ix) and the arm reliquary of St. Lawrence, (Figures 104-105) from Henry the Lion's time. There is also clear evidence of the activity of a goldsmith shop in Brunswick by this time. During Otto the Mild's reign, the collegiate chapter ordered the binding of a plenar. The book, a venerable manuscript of the tenth century with masses and special prayers for Sundays, according to an inscription on the back flap of the binding, was rebound in 1326. The front cover (Figure 147) is of embossed silver with chased gilt medallions of christological scenes as well as others of the four evangelists against a background of large, symmetrically arranged engraved ivy designs. The central field is occupied by six standing figures: that of the Virgin and Child between SS. Peter and Paul, and below, the protectors of the cathedral, John the Baptist flanked by SS. Blaise and Thomas 117</page><page sequence="117">of Canterbury. Slightly retardative, the style, design, and finish of the object suggest the activity of a provincial workshop familiar with the soft style of courtly child-like figures prevalent in the art of Germany, France, and England around 1300, and bent on the ready appeal of an easy imagery. Produced by the very same workshop is a large gilt-silver cross (Figure 148) also formerly in the Guelph Treasure and since 1931 in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Mounted on a six-sided copper foot in the fifteenth century, this object, meant to be placed on an altar, bears the figure of Christ in chased relief. Each of the arms ends in a roundel with one of the symbols of the evangelists which are cast from the very same molds as the corresponding forms on the Plenarfor Sundays (Figure 147), while the swirling tendril punch design on the sides of the cross closely parallels the conceptualized ivy frieze on the binding of the plenar. An important object only slightly later in date is the reliquary in the shape of a book (Back Cover and Figure 149) in the Cleveland Museum. This noteworthy example of goldsmith work consists of partly gilded silver plaques mounted on a wooden core and framing the large ivory relief of the Miracle Figure 148.

A simulated codex, the ob ject was designed as a reliquary and until at least 1482 held four pages of text from an ancient gospel as well as some relics of the 11,000 Virgins of Cologne and those of four other unspe cified saints.85 That the reliquary was greatly valued is clearly suggested by the preciousness of the material used and by its wealth of or namental details. On the four metal plaques framing the ivory are the settings for thirty-two pearls (ten lacking), four rubies (three remain), eight green stones (emeralds and paste glass), and four crystals underlaid with blue pigment. The most im portant insets, however, are carved gems of the late Roman Im perial period, that is, of the third or fourth centuries: a large onyx intaglio with a man and a woman in bust-length, an onyx cameo with the bust of Minerva, and a cornelian intaglio with a Gorgon head. In the lower frame a fourth inset of a hard red stone, perhaps a bezoan, now very damaged, apparently seems to have been crudely shaped as a bearded man's face, recalling those wild figures (Figure 150) on the ninth-century Enger Burse Reliquary in Berlin. Radiating from each stone in the Cleveland Book-Shaped Reliquary are soldered metal wires terminating in large ivy leaves. All of these ornaments have been applied on a metal surface worked with patterns of stippling that recall scales of snakeskin, and they contrast dramatically to the smooth, milky ivory. The reverse of the Cleveland reliquary is covered with a thick sheet of partly gilded silver which has slightly buckled with age and has been repaired (Figure 151). In an architectural setting appears John the Baptist pointing to the image of the Holy Lamb and flanked by SS. Thomas of Canterbury and Blaise represented as blessing bishops. As if statues, they stand on in dividual piers under narrow Gothic gables against an etched, tightly knit, patterned background identical to the one on the obverse. The thick silver sheets which line the surface of the four narrow sides (Figure 149) are decorated with a pattern of ivy and large undulating tendrils, similar, though not identical, to that on the Plenarfor Sundays (Figure 147). The most important relic enshrined by order of Otto the Mild must have been the fragment of St. Blaise's skull. For it, a full bust representing the bishop saint was fashioned of gilt-silver (Figure 152) with precious stones and even an enamel medallion, possibly French, representing somewhat incongruously a music making centaur. Again, technical elements link this shrine to the ducal workshop. The sprays of wide ivy leaves forming a decorative net for the cabochons are identical with those crowd ing the background decoration of the Book-ShapedReliquary.</page><page sequence="120">Figure 151.

These roundels are identical in shape to those on the cover of the PlenarforSundays (Figure 147) of 1326 and to those on the gilt-silver altar cross (Figure 148) in Chicago. The decor of engraved ivy leaves on the silver sides of the plenar (Figure 156) is familiar to us from both the Book-Shaped Reliquary (Figure 149) and the Plenarfor Sundays (Figure 147), while the back cover (Figure 157), a chased and nielloed sheet of partial ly gilded silver, is clearly in the same style as the reverse of the Cleveland shrine (Figure 151). Otto and Agnes kneel at either side of the blessing St. Blaise seated on a curule chair which rests on a platform bearing the names Otto and Agnes as well as their arms. In the arcature above the duke appears a praying woman; above Agnes of Bradenburg is a running dog about to grasp a pig, a mawkish reference to a miracle performed by the saint who, at the entreaty of the woman, saved the life of her swine. During Romanesque times, relics had been venerated while concealed within shrines. In the Gothic period, on the contrary, it became customary to make the actual relic visible to the faithful through apertures in reliquaries, the latter now becom ing monstrances. An arm reliquary fashioned for a relic of St. George (Figure 158)-another commission related to the patronage of Otto the Mild - with the entire length of the in ner side of the arm covered with open grill work (Figure 159), is a primary example of these new devotional preferences. On the back is the engraved figure of the knightly saint facing St. Blaise and carrying a shield with the arms of Otto the Mild's younger brother Albrecht of Brunswick-Gottingen, Bishop of Halberstadt from 1324 until 1357.86 By the fifteenth century metal reliquaries in the shape of parts of the human body were no longer in fashion.

Whereabouts unknown. reliquaries continued to be produced in Brunswick, it was only in the relatively inexpensive medium of carved and polychromed wood. One of the last of these modest reliquaries to enter the Guelph Treasure was fashioned for the arm of one of the Thou sand Saintly Warriors (Figure 160). Concurrently, and actual ly beginning in the late years of the fourteenth century, it in creasingly became the tendency to fashion monstrances that i_ were more abstract in shape, either circular containers on a foot (Figure 148) or architectural structures (Figure 160) built to hold a translucent container in which the relic - invariably a bone, a tooth, or a piece of garment- could be seen. A series of such Gothic monstrances dating to the fourteenth and fifteenth cen turies is in the Guelph Treasure, one of the latest in date being in Cleveland (Color Plate xxII). This highly decorative struc ture is made of gilt-silver in the shape of a Gothic church framed by an involved series of buttresses and crowned by a wide lantern centering on the narrow crystal cylinder containing a limb bone identified by a parchment as that of St. Sebastian. The relic of the healer saint par excellence had been acquired by Duke Henry the Peaceful in 1473, for the purpose of warding off the plague then taking a heavy toll in Lower Saxony. Made shortly after wards, the monstrance is in fact specifically identified in the in ventory of 1482 as the "monstrancia nova."87 The fifteenth century sought to mark the old church of St. Blaise with a stamp of "modernism." In the period 1469-1474, for example, the Romanesque north aisle was replaced by a double hall in the late Gothic style supported on columns with a spiral decoration and ogival ribs prominently applied on the vaulting. The Treasure was also added to without interruption. Several of the new objects, such as the Veltheim Cross, now in Chicago or the two small receptacles for carrying the host (AgnusDeicapsulae) (Figure 161) now in Berlin were, however, the gifts of the lesser gentry and wealthy burghers, rather than of the ruling house.88 Figure 161.

In 1528 the Brunswickers eagerly em braced the Reformation although the ducal house remained Catholic. Georg, brother of the reigning Duke Heinrich II was then dean of the foundation and tended to its property, but in 1540, during a series of bitter doctrinal conflicts, the town coun cil, as it rose to further power, demanded the suppression of the foundation as a Catholic collegiate chapter. A new constitu tion leaning to Lutheran beliefs was evolved for St. Blaise, though Heinrich II did try in 1547 and 1558- but to no avail - to re-establish the Catholic service. The relics, which in former days had been stored in chests in the sacristy when not displayed on altars or carried in processions, were now placed within the high altar itself. Despite this precaution, in 1574 twenty monstrances were stolen by night. To balance recorded losses such as this one, and others which remained unaccounted for, additions were made to the Treasure - in 1545 when the foun dation of St. Cyriacus was abolished, for example, a great part of its treasury was transferred to St. Blaise. This explains the fact that several Medieval reliquaries which are included in the revised inventory of the year 1697 had not been mentioned in the 1482 document.89 Until the seventeenth century there is no indication that the Treasure was considered to be the property of the ruling house independent from the foundation church. When a member of the family, Duke Anton Ulrich, a famous art collector, took some of the objects from the Treasure in 1658 and again in 1661, giving one or more to his granddaughter Elizabeth Christina, wife of Prince Charles vi of Austria, he seems to have been the first to have crossed that thin and delicate boundary. His brother Rudolph August in fact even entered into negotiation with elec torate representatives of Cologne and Hildesheim in 1663, with a view of selling the entire Treasure, but finally only the large collection of vestments owned by the cathedral was alienated.90 In 1670 the Brunswickers openly revolted against Duke Ru dolph August in an attempt to unite with Prussia. The duke had to be swift; with the help of his cousins of the Liineburg branch - the three brothers Georg Wilhelm von Celle, Johann Friedrich of Hanover, and Ernst August, bishop of Osnabriick he forced the town to surrender. It was necessary for Rudolph August to provide indemnity to his allies. Johann Friedrich (Figure 162), who in 1651 had become a member of the Catholic church, demanded no less than the Guelph Treasure as booty. With the exception of the Arm Reliquary of St. Blaise (Figure 29) and an ivory hunting horn (Figure 65), the objects were re lin'quished and quickly removed to Hanover. There they were Figure 162.

Later, in 1697, Molanus published an inventory in German of the Treasure under the Latin title of Lipsanographiasive Thesaurus sanctarum Reliquiarium Electoralis Brunsvico-Luneburgicus. It was slightly revised and translated into Latin and printed in 1713 and 1724 by another keeper, Johann Heinrich Jung. It is primarily a descriptive list of the numerous relics which the Treasure includes seen from the standpoint of a "cabinet de curiosity" rather than as a sacral treasure. In a letter of 1713 to the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, Kurfiirstin Sophie, who presided over the intellectual life at the court of Hanover, questioned the veracity of the relics, suggesting in Volterian over tones gullibility on the part of Molanus.92 In the meantime, the dukes of the House of Brunswick Liineburg had been created electors of Hanover in 1692 by im perial decree. The Treasure remained in the court chapel (Figure 163) of Hanover until 1803 and was seen only by a very few. In that year, fearing an invasion by the Napoleonic armies, it was temporarily taken to England where the House of Hanover had ruled since 1714. In 1814 the title of elector of Hanover was raised to that of King by the Congress of Vienna. In 1861 King George v of Hanover (Figure 164), a cousin of Queen Victoria, found ed the Guelph Museum in his capital. Its principal holdings were a picture gallery drawn from the Cumberland Collection, the Guelph Treasure, and a group of thirty-eight objects and some sixty manuscripts from Liineburg, all dating from the eleventh to the sixteenth century and all of which were eventually dis persed among various Hanoverian institutions. While seeking to imbue his dynasty with an aura of grandeur, King George saw to the construction between 1857 and 1866 of the pictur esque Welfen Schloss, or Palace of the Guelph, built in a Ro manesque style with clear reminiscences of Brunswick's old Dankwarderode, on the outskirts of the Herrenhausen Gardens. He also purchased from the Cathedral of Prague the gospels of his most prestigious ancestor, Henry the Lion, a volume which had apparently been solicited by Emperor Charles IV when he visited Brunswick in the 1360s or 1370s.93 The new dreams of Guelph grandeur though were soon shat tered. In 1867 Hanover, and with it the possessions of the House</page><page sequence="130">Figure 165. The neo-Gothic Schloss Cumberland, Gmunden. A one-time repository for the Guelph Treasure. _l''''_ yi~i of Brunswick-Liineburg, were annexed by Prussia. George v was deposed. A settlement negotiated in September of that year called for financial compensation for the former ruling family and recognized the Guelph Museum as its private property. The dethroned king and his family went into exile retiring to the neo-Gothic castle of Cumberland at Gmunden in Austria (Figure 165). In that very year the Treasure, with the exception of a few unimportant pieces, was removed to Penzing Castle near Vienna. In 1869 the former King George, now known as duke of Cumberland (an English title which had been his father's before ascending the Hanoverian throne in 1837), entrusted the Treasure to the Osterreichisches Museum fur Kunst und In dustrie in Vienna. The following year restoration was carried out on some of the objects there by C. Haas and members of the Restaurischule des kaiserlich Belvederes.94 Duke Ernst August I (Figure 166), son of the duke of Cumberland, com missioned from Father W. A. Neumann of the Cistercian order an extensive compilation of the Treasure, 300 copies of which were printed in 1891 in Vienna under the title Der Reli quiarienschatz des Hauses Braunschweig-Luneburg and illus trated with 144 line drawings by F. W. Bader.95 Four years earlier to commemorate the modus vivendi that the pope brought about between the Catholic church and the German state, the duke had presented Leo xIII with a startling, near duplicate copy (Figure 167) of the apostle arm reliquary in Cleveland (Color Plates xiv-xvIII) in which, according to a dedicatory in scription on the base plate, was incorporated a relic of St. Blaise. 131</page><page sequence="131">i ' , Figure 166.

Postcard sold at the time in the region of Hanover. This skillfully executed object is now the property of the Church of Dardago, a small town in northern Italy.96 In the 1890s the Guelph Treasure was removed to the ducal schloss in Gmunden, and in 1918 it is said to have been taken from there to Switzerland for safekeeping in a bank vault. An icy barrier separated the House of Hanover, living in exile, and the Prussian imperial family and its government. Protracted negotiations concerning the so-called Guelph Fund- that is, the substantial sum assigned to the dethroned king of Hanover in 1866 by the Prussians - had never been concluded and were in fact eventually cancelled on the pretense that the former king had not officially abdicated. It was Duke Ernst August II (1887-1953) (Figure 166), who made headway from the return of the Brunswick-Liineburgs to Germany. He became heir to the ducal title in 1911 when his elder brother died, and in 1913 ended the long controversy between the houses of Hohenzollern and Guelph by marrying Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter Victoria Louise, making Blankenburg, a picturesque locality at the foot of the Harz Mountains, his main seat in Germany. Fully associating himself with the Prussian regime, he participated in World War I first as a colonel and then as a major-general of the Totenkopf, a well-known cavalry regiment instrumen tal in the invasion of Belgium and northern France.97 In the aftermath of the war, after the collapse of the imperial regime, the House of Brunswick-Liineburg found itself in Ger many without clear allies. Ernst August II, although reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in landed properties, was hard pressed to maintain the standards of his court: addressed as "His Royal Highness," he held to all the social prerogatives of the throne. In addition to his five children, the duke had several im poverished relatives and at least sixty major retainers for whom he had to provide. Resumed negotiations with the new govern ment, the Weimar Republic, for the recovery of the Guelph Fund, led to a formal public vote in 1923 calling for the restitu tion of the private properties of the House of Brunswick Liinebug, thereby laying the path for an eventual but still dis tant settlement. From 1921 onwards, every other year parts of the royal collection- mostly silver and paintings, and including such important items as Holbein's Portrait of Prince Edward vI(Washington, National Gallery) - were being sold through various agents. In the 1920s while negotiating for the Guelph Fund, Ernst August I1 indicated that he would probably sell the family's historically prized heirloom - the Guelph Treasure - which he unofficially valued at ten million dollars. In subsequent transactions with government officials, the duke bound himself to a clause promising not to sell the Guelph Treasure if the funds</page><page sequence="132">Figure 167. Copy of the Arm Reliquary of the Apostles in Cleveland. Silver and enamel on a core of wood, H. 20-1/16 inches (51 cm.). Austria, Vienna(?), 1887. Dardago, Church. were indeed made available. The wavering government, faced with a crumbling economy, proved unable to raise the required sum and could only make provisions for the duke to receive the Castle of Marienburg, some fifteen miles south of Hanover. By late 1928 rumors that negotiations for the sale of at least part of the Guelph Treasure, then still in a Swiss bank, were near ing conclusion caused a stir throughout Germany, particular ly in Hanover. The provincial administrator of Hanover, Noske, who had been in direct contact with the duke, appealed to the German government, the Prussian Diet, and the Hanover mu nicipal council to purchase the Treasure, reportedly at a special price then equivalent to $2,500,000. But this was to no avail. The Treasure was subsequently quietly sold to a syndicate of art dealers: Julius F. Goldschmidt of Berlin and Z. M. Hacken broch and J. Rosenbaum of Frankfurt-am-Main. Both the price (anywhere from five to ten million dollars as reported by the press) and whatever restrictions the transaction might have car ried remained a tightly kept secret.98 No efforts were spared at this point to publicize the collec tion's availability. A new publication, Die Welfenschatz, essen tially a large catalogue describing the eighty-two items of the Treasure, was commissioned from Otto von Falke, Robert Schmidt, and Georg Swarzenski, a team of well-recognized art historians. The Treasure was put on public exhibit in 1930, first for six weeks during the summer in Frankfurt-am-Main at the prestigious Stadelsche Kunstinstitut and then in Berlin at the Deutsche Gesellschaft, a private association, after the govern ment, in a last-minute decision, opposed its being shown at the Arts and Craft Museum in order "not to facilitate action that might be conducive to the loss of the Treasure for Germany." Given the current economic conditions, however, the dealers l met with little result in Germany. Though the Frankfurt and Berlin exhibits drew crowds, only a few items of secondary im portance were purchased by private German collectors and a Swedish banker.99 During the Frankfurt showing one significant commitment was made, however, by an American. William M. Milliken (Figure 168), the new director and curator of decorative arts of The Cleveland Museum of Art, reserved six of the most im portant objects for purchase. He had come to view the exhibit and said he would present to his museum trustees for their ap proval the CumberlandMedallion (Color Plate IV), the "Paten _ . of St. Bernward" in its monstrance (Front Cover, Color Plate i XIII), the Arm Reliquary of the Apostles (Color Plates XIV- _ XVIII), the Horn of St. Blaise (Color Plate x), the Book-Shaped Reliquary with the Ottonian ivory (Back cover, Figures 17, 149, | _ l V: 133</page><page sequence="133">Figure 168. William M. Milliken (1889-1978) in 1930. 151), and the Byzantine PortableAltar in Tablet Form (Figure 63). In early October at an accessions meeting in Cleveland, the Trustees headed by President John L. Severance and Vice Presidents William G. Mather and Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., for mally agreed to purchase the six reserved pieces, and the ob jects went on public view in the Museum's Rotunda before the month was over. Cleveland's acquisitions were widely publicized. Indicative of the times, the main headlines and the copy distributed by the Associated Press emphasized the religious aspect of the pur chase over its aesthetic value: "Fragment of True Cross in Cleveland Museum of Art," "Museum Buys Part of Cross," "Cleveland Museum Now Houses Fragment of True Cross of Calvary," "Portion of Cross for Art Museum," all focusing on the relic visible through rock crystals in the monstrance of the "Paten of St. Bernward"(Color Plate XIII). It was, in fact, the fourth fragment of the True Cross to reach America.'?? In the fall of 1930, perhaps partially spurred on by Milliken's enthusiasm, the dealers brought the Treasure to the United States where all of the eighty-two pieces were exhibited. Cleveland's six objects were taken to New York by train by the four Trustees, John L. Severance, Francis F. Prentiss, William G. Mather, and Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., who were serving on the honorary committee of the New York exhibition along with J. P. Morgan, Randolph Hearst, Clarence H. MacKay, Michael Friedman, Philip Lehman, and Jules S. Bache. The well attended exhibit was first shown from 30 November until the end of the year at the newly created Goldschmidt and Reinhardt Galleries at 730 Fifth Avenue at the corner of 57th Street. Pro ceeds of the admissions benefited the urbane Big Sisters Philan thropies, "concerned with the problems of adolescent girls." The opening day address was delivered by William Milliken. The most widely published item during the New York showing was the Dome Reliquary (Figure 122) estimated to be worth from $500,000 to $750,000 by the press. The exhibit then traveled to Cleveland where, according to the Museum's president, it was the most significant event since the institution's founding in 1916. It was shown in four special ly designed galleries from 10 January to 1 February 1931, bring ing a recorded number of 74,894 visitors (Figure 169). "Culture has been put in competition with world series baseball," com mented Robert Bordner in the Cleveland Press of 31 January 1931. Milliken, during the Cleveland showing, convinced the far from unwilling Museum Trustees to make a further com mitment of purchasing the PortableAltar of Countess Gertrude (Color Plates v-Ix) as well as the two ceremonial crosses (Color 134</page><page sequence="134">Plates I-III). One cross was bought through the J. H. Wade Fund with a supplementary gift from Mrs. E. B. Greene, Mr. Wade's daughter. The altar and second cross were acquired through the John Huntington Art and Polytechnic Trust. One concession was made: the Byzantine Portable Altar in Tablet Form (Figure 63), which had been accessioned at the October 1930 meeting, was to be returned, but as it ranked far secon dary in artistic importance relative to the Gertrude altar, the condition was clearly acceptable. Supportive, the dealers (Figure 169) as a gesture of good will and in "appreciation of the respect shown the relics and their reliquaries" (Cleveland Press, 10 January 1931) by the Cleveland public, offered the fifteenth Figure 169.

Cleveland's collection of goldsmith works of the Middle Ages, if still limited in number, by its quality now ranked among the major ones and placed the Museum in the forefront of American institutions owning Medieval objects. With the exception of the nine pieces acquired by the Cleveland Museum, the Treasure traveled to the Detroit Institute of Arts where it was exhibited from 10 to 25 February, to the Pennsylvania Museum of Art from 16 to 23 March, and then to the Art Institute of Chicago from 31 March to 20 April to the great delight of enterprising members of the Antiquarian Society (Figure 170). Finally it traveled to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, where the remaining forty two pieces were shown from 1 to 31 December. Other North American collections acquired some of the objects but none truly emulated Milliken. The Fogg Museum of Harvard Univer sity bought the Siculo-Arabic ivory Casket in Tower Form (Figure 64). In Chicago the Antiquarian Society of the Art In stitute acquired the fourteenth-century gilt-silver Altar Cross (Figure 148), Mrs. Lucy M. Buckingham bought three four teenth-fifteenth century reliquaries (Figure 160), Chauncy McCormick, a long-standing museum trustee, purchased four other pieces of the same period (Figure 148), with the under standing that those objects would eventually be given to the Art Institute. Both the Pennsylvania Museum of Art, now the Phila delphia Museum of Art, and the Nelson Art Gallery in Kansas City, then under construction, acquired two pieces: the Arm Reliquary ofSt. Babylas, dated 1467, and anAgnusDei, a reli quary cross and a monstrance, respectively. After leaving San Francisco, the bulk of the Treasure was returned to Europe via New York and was stored in Austria. In May 1931 the Berlin correspondent of the Art News Weekly reported that the duke of Brunswick-Liineburg was attempt ing to sell outside of Germany an important picture from the Anton Ulrich-Museum in Brunswick, an institution of which the duke was part owner since it was another foundation of his ancestors. The work was Vermeer's Girl with the Wine Glass (also known as The Coquette) which had been declared an im portant national property. In order to circumvent the govern ment's ruling, Ernst August II first proposed to give some Guelph Treasure pieces to the museum and subsequently to ex change the painting for the Dome Reliquary (Figure 122), add ing as well a cash payment of 800,000 marks to provide funds for museum maintenance. 10 The response against letting the 136</page><page sequence="136">Vermeer leave the museum was overwhelming and the scheme failed. The episode is enlightening as it clearly indicates that the duke still had personal control over the dispersion of the Guelph Treasure. When the Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933, louder voices bewailed the loss of the Guelph Treasure. The writer Erich Muksam made himself the spokesman of widespread feelings when he denounced the sales as spoliations of the nation on the part of the ducal family for base monetary reasons. He generally proposed that the family give to the state the remain ing objects. At the same time, the duke was still appealing to the high court for compensation. The new Socialist Party, how ever, though it sought the support of monarchists in a common fear of Communism, had other priorities. It was only two years later that the state made a specific effort to purchase the balance of the Guelph Treasure consisting of forty-four objects. The new regime for ideological reasons was keen on using Henry the Lion - the hero who envisioned a federated Germany - as a historical myth. The transaction was handled through the "Preussischer Regierung fur die Berliner Museum" for the equivalent of $2,500,000. Prodded by Popitz, the minister of fine arts, Hermann Goring, the newly created commander in chief of the Luftwaffe whose well-known interest in art objects was to lead to excess, is reputed to have been behind the purchase. 102 The tribulations of the Guelph Treasure had not quite ended, for one of the prizes of the collection, the Gospels of Henry the Lion, a manuscript which prior to World War II had been on the list of national treasures in Germany, was yet unac counted for. Indeed it was not part of any of the protracted sales of 1930-35. Kept for a long time at Schloss Cumberland in Austria, just before the Anschluss it was secretly removed to Switzerland. After World War II, the Prince of Hanover, as Duke Ernst August II wished to be called, sold Schloss Cumberland, hav ing received from the German government the rolling fields of Calenberg at the foot of Marienburg Castle. Even before his death in 1951, however, the ducal family was again in financial need in order to maintain its status. Sales of parts of the ancestral heritage occurred approximately twice each decade. Among them were the famous royal library manuscripts and printed books including many incunabulae, the baroque silver service made for Friedrich Wilhelm Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim, and the important coin collection of Georg II. In 1983 the Gospels of Henry the Lion finally surfaced for sale and drew a record price at Sotheby's London.'03 Time has left a deep scar in the history of the Cathedral of St. Blaise. After many vicissitudes, it was given over to the Lutheran denomination, the very confession that broke its en tity. In the 1930s and early 1940s, it was desecrated when transformed into the "Umbau als Nationale Weiheistatte" (Hall of State Consecration), the site of ideological harangues by Hitler's henchmen. Concurrently, the family which considered this church its God-granted shrine, kept its treasury sealed not as a precious trust but as its own private property - an excep tion among princely houses in Western history- finally dispos ing of it for purely materialistic reasons. The objects were not only scattered but divested of their spiritual values. Had mar tyrs delivered themselves to the wild beasts to see their relics pass into eternal oblivion? Had the munificent donors and skill ful artists of Romanesque and Gothic times proudly given and wrought the sacred vessels for naught? It is a palm granted by capricious history that in the end the sacral treasure of St. Blaise has achieved greater fame than most other church collections, its very tribulations and division having actually fanned the fire of its renown. In an age in which material values compete with cultural ones, and spiritual values are often threadbare, the Guelph Treasure appears not only as a magical zeitgeist of Medieval times, but also as an enduring reminder of the rich artistic accomplishments of Germany.</page><page sequence="137">Cleveland's Guelph Treasure objects displayed in the Museum Rotunda. 138</page><page sequence="138">APPENDIX I Contents of the Guelph Treasure as Known in the Twentieth Century The objects listed here are arranged chronologically and geo graphically.

The Cleveland ivory, it can be assumed, was readily available in Brunswick in the fourteenth cen tury when incorporated in the Book-Shaped Reliquary produced there.

Also attributed to Roger is another portable altar (repr. in Lasko, fig. 163) and the bind ing of a gospel book (for which see our fig. 137). Roger of Helmars hausen may also be the author -using the Greek pseudonym of Theophilus - of the already mentioned treatise The VariousArts (De DiversisArtibus). Indeed, in what seems to be the earliest manuscript that survives of this treatise, the heading states "Theophilius qui est Rugerius" (Theophilus who is Roger). Theophilus, a knowledgeable monk, was unequivocally also a practicing craftsman. His invaluable compendium on artistic techniques offers instruction on painting and glassworking, and mostly on the large variety of processes used in gold smith work and bronze casting. It in fact describes, if often too suc cinctly, the methods used in the making of most objects in the Guelph Treasure, from the refining of gold and silver to the designing of chalices, patens, censers, altar-frontals, bookcovers, and reliquaries (see the stan dard Latin/English translation by Dodwell and the more recent edi tion by Hawthorne and Smith). 35.

The two major accounts of Henry the Lion's life used here are: the recension of Arnold von Liibeck's Chronica Slavorum (Chronicle of the Slavs) and that of Helmold von Bosau's Chronica Slavorum, both by J. M. Lappenberg, and published (separately) as school editions by George H. Pertz in Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum (Hanover: Im pensis Bibliopolii Hahniani, 1868). For a transcription of all major documents relating to the rule of Henry the Lion, see Karl Jordan, Die Urkunden Heinrichs des Lowen Herzogs von Sachsen und Bayern, Monumenta Germaniae Historica 500-1500, I (Leipzig: Verlag Karl W. Hiersemann, 1941). For Henry's treatment of the Slavs, see Edouard Jordan, Histoire du Moyen Age, iv,: L'Allemagne et l'Italie aux XIf et XIIf siecles (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1939), pp. 126-128; Winifred Bauman, Die Sage von Heinrich dem L6wen beiden Slaven (Munich: Verlag Otto Sagner, 1975). The only English work on Henry the Lion's life is the brief sketch of Austin L. Pole, Henry the Lion, the Lothian Historical Essay for 1912 (Oxford: B. H. Blackwell 1912). Among works in German, still very useful for its documenta tion and perceptiveness is Martin Philippson, Heinrich derLoweHerzog von Bayern und Sachsen, 2nd. ed. (Leipzig: Dsfar Leiner, 1918). Of the several studies published in recent years, I have consulted Paul Barz, Heinrich derLowe. Eine WelfebewegtdieGeschichte(Bonn: Keil Verlag, 1977); Karl Jordan, Heinrich der L6we. Eine Biographie (Munich: Verlag C. H. Beck, 1979); idem, "Die Stadtpolitik Heinrichs des Lowen," in Brunswiek 1031- Braunschweig 1981, Festschrift zur Ausstellung, ed. Matthias Puhle (Brunswick: Stadtisches Museum, 1981), pp. 97-103. The ancient Castle of Dankwarderode built by Henry the Lion was repeatedly damaged by fire, rebuilt and enlarged, particularly so in 1887, when it was uniformly restored in a neo-Romanesque mode including paintings in troubadour style by Quensen. It has undergone yet another restoration in the early 1980s. 38. Arnold von Liibeck, Chronica Slavorum, ed.

Von Falke and Frauberger, Deutsche Schmelzarbeiten, pp. 21-46. An origin in Saxony, with an attribution to the Weland Workshop, for these Apostle plaques, as proposed by G. Swarzenski, "Kunstkreis," pp. 244-246, which has been adhered to since in the literature (see, for example, Irmgard Woldergin, Mittelalters: Bronze, Email, Elfenbein, Kestner-Museums, [Hanover: Ferdinand Stuttmann, 1966], p. 58, no. 57; pl. 160), is in our opinion not convincing. The drawing and the exe cution of these trapezoidal plaques are markedly different from the Reli quary of Henry II(Figure 94), bearing a closer similarity to Rhenish examples strongly influenced by Mosan models. For the relationship between Mosan and Colognese enamelers, see Dietrich Kotzsche, "Zum Stand der Forschung der Goldschmiedekunst des 12. Jahrhunderts im Rhein-Maas-Gebiet," in Rhein undMaas: Kunst undKultur800-1400, vol.

It has been suggested by Lasko (Ars Sacra, pp. 200-201) that the portable altar by Eilbertus might well have been acquired by Henry the Lion's father, Henry the Proud, in con nection with a partial reconstruction and refurbishing in 1137 of the by then century-old Brunon foundation, but such an early dating would make the chronology of related plaques rather unintelligible both in the Mosan Region as well as in Germany. 48.

The splendid painted ceiling of St. Michael of Hildesheim produced shortly after the fire of 1186, which is dominated by an elaborate Tree ofJesse, also includes a series of standing prophets in rectangular frames or in medallions (best repr. in Johannes Sommer, DasDeckenbildderMichaeliskirche zu Hildesheim [Hildesheim: Verlag Gebriider Gerstendberg, 1966]). It is essential to note in these compositions, steeped in twelfth-century formulas, that the ground behind the standing prophets is composed of concentric colored rectangles, the inner one being blue and the ex terior one green, and that between the two colors there is a thin gold line reminiscent of the division between champleve enamel fields in a fashion directly echoing the series of plaques described here and at tributed to Hildesheim workshops. 51.

Examined in the Cleveland Museum laboratory by Frederick Hollendonner, the back of the champlev6 plaque indeed has areas of cuprite - that reddish cuprous oxide which cannot be in duced and which builds up on copper and bronze before the appearance of verdigris - as would form on an object at least one hundred years old. This oxidation is somewhat less detectable on the decorative cloi sonne elements flanking the sides of the pyx. 55. On the Stavelot PortableAltar, see Rhein undMaas, p. 252. no.

The second chalice in Tremessen Abbey, now Gniezno (Poland), may have been a gift from Henry the Lion to the Polish King Boleslaw iv (1146-1172), who ordered the construction of this foundation. The decorative spirals of the chalice inlaid in niello and the engraved figures reserved in gilt-silver clearly follow the scheme of theBerthold Chalice, with greater emphasis, however, on architectural elements. The cen tral field of the paten for the Tremessen Chalice is occupied with the depiction of Christ on the cross surrounded by the representations of Church and Synagogue as on the series of "Hildesheim" enamel plaques (Figures 90-92).

Around the year 1286 (according to Stephen Beissel, DerAachen fahrt: Verehrung der Aachen Heiligtumer seit den Tagen Karls des Grossen bis in unsereZeit [Freiburg-im-Bresgau: Herder, 1902]), Pope Honorius III issued a bull of remission to pilgrims who visited the Cathedral of Hildesheim on the feast day of St. Oswald, this date pro viding only a terminus post quem for the presence of the reliquary in Hildesheim. A gilt-silver chalice ornamented with gems and its paten, both clearly dating of ca. 1400, now in the Hildesheim Cathedral Treasury are likewise referred to by an old tradition as "the chalice and paten of St. Bernward" (for these, see Elbern and Reuther, Hildesheimer Domschatz, pp. 25-27, no. 14; pls. 10-11). Conceivably, the Cleveland Paten may have come to the Guelph Treasure from Hildesheim after one of Henry the Lion's descendants, Heinrich III, became bishop of Hildesheim in 1331 (see Neumann, Reliquienschatz, p. 297). 63.

See above note 11 with inventory. According to Neumann, Reli quienschatz, p. 235, when the reliquary was opened in 1887, it held a single parchment leaf, considered to date to the fourteenth century, which included an excerpt from the Good Friday liturgy. When opened again in May 1984, it was empty. Quite noticeable was the fact that the entire wooden core had been replaced, probably in 1887. 86.

The purchase of the Gospels of Henry the Lion from Prague by V. Klopp and S. Culemann on order of George v is hinted at in Register 36 Alt. 158, consisting of correspondence of 1860-1890 exchanged with W. A. Neumann, at the Niedersachsisches Staatsarchiv.

Those relics of the True Cross already in the United States were at the Sacred Heart Church of the University of Notre-Dame, South Bend, IN; Chapel of the Foreign Mission, Catholic University, Washington, DC; Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston. Needless to say, the purchase was also proudly heralded by William Milliken ("The Acquisition of Six Objects from the Guelph Treasure"). 154</page><page sequence="154">101.

For the politics and controversies surrounding the sale of the Guelph Treasure within Germany, see Ernst Grohne, "Zur Discussion fiber den Welfenschatz," Niedersachsen, xxxvII (1932), 30-31. For reports of the sale to Berlin, see for example, ArtNews, 17 August 1935, p. 11. The documents relating to the sale are now in East Germany, perhaps in East Berlin. Queries as to their whereabouts were not answered and request for permission to examine them was not granted. The Landes (federal state) of Brunswick had been the first to join the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeitpartei (of which Nazi is the ab breviation), and the venerable Cathedral of St. Blaise was transformed into the "Umbau als Nationale Weihestatte," or Hall of State Consecra tion where ideological speeches were delivered. On 24 June 1935 in con nection with an official visit by Chancellor Adolf Hitler, the tombs of Henry the Lion and Matilda were opened with the expectation that this would support the racial criteria of the regime. But the exhumation was a sore disappointment, Henry's remains clearly showing him as a small, lame, and dark-haired man, in shocking contrast to the fair recumbent figure on his tomb. The chancellor, it is reported, was no less disap pointed in the fact that Matilda proved to have been taller than was her consort (Dietrich Kuessner, Geschichte der Braunschweigischen Landeskirche 1930-1947im Uberblick [Biddenstedt: Pfarramt Offleben, 1981]). The fate of the three dealers associated with the sale of the Guelph Treasure is as follows: Z. M. Hackenbroch returned to Germany and died in Frankfurt before the beginning of the war; J. Rosenbaum moved to Amsterdam, where he died during the 1940s, while his nephew Saemy Rosenberg remained in America and with Eric Stiebel opened the firm of Rosenberg and Stiebel Inc. in New York; Julius Goldschmidt established himself in London as a dealer in Renaissance bronzes and died there in the early 1950s. 103.
