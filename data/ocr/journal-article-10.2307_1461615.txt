Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings and pipe! Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals! Let everything that breathes praise the Lord! (Psalm 150 [RSV]) Someday, emerging at last from this terrifying vision, may I burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels! (Rilke, Duino Elegies I) he first of these epigraphs, the 150th Psalm, coming at the very end of the Psalter, is an obvious doxology, a hymn of praise, a burst into jubilant praise to the God of the Hebrews. It tells where God is to be praised - in the sanctuary and in the firmament; it tells why He is to be praised - for His mighty deeds; it tells how he is to be praised - with the string instruments, the pipes, and the cymbals (the percussion instruments appropriately coming last)! And then its splendid conclusion --let everything that breathes, literally everything in creation, praise Him! The second epigraph, from Rilke, suggests (1) that this penchant for praise remains also an aspiration of the modern poet, and (2) that the circumstance of praise is difficult to come by, since it presupposes receptivity and "openness" and a STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER (Ph.D., Drew University) is the Bishop W.

This is very likely the place (as Roethke put it) "where knock is open wide." We know it in Hopkins' "Pied Beauty" which begins "Glory be to God for dappled things..." and ends "He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:/ Praise him." Edith Sitwell, on completing her canticles, said simply that "her poems were hymns of praise to the glory of life." Auden, too, aspired to this circumstance. Very early in his career he aimed "to show an affirming flame." In his remarkable poem In Memory of W. B. Yeats he expresses what may well be the most durable statement of the authentic function of the poet in a time such as ours: Follow, poet, follow right To the bottom of the night, With your unconstraining voice Still persuade us to rejoice; With the farming of a verse Make a vineyard of the curse, Sing of human unsuccess In a rapture of distress; In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start, In the prison of his days Teach the free man how to praise. I am persuaded that this is for Auden, at bottom (that is, when he is not thinking too much or trying too hard), what he believes poetry is all about. That this is a rare moment in Auden points at the same time to something in his genius, and points also perhaps to something in us and in our time which might be described as an obstructive, recalcitrant, or inhibiting factor - something deep within us that prevents our coming to the place where the knock is open wide, and which thwarts thereby the circumstance of praise. Perhaps we should put alongside these fortunate verses a broken poem from his Sonnet Sequence called "The Quest." It is entitled "The Waters." Poet. oracle and wit Like unsuccessful anglers by The ponds of apperception sit, Baiting with the wrong request The vectors of their interest; At nightfall tell the angler's lie. The waters long to hear our questions put Which would release their longed-for answer, but.

But Augustine also said, "Man himself is a great deep,"' and what we have here, by reason of the I Saint Augustine, Confessions IV, xiv. 24.</page><page sequence="3">W. H. AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 137 confessional dimension in these sonnets of the quest, is a picture of Auden as poet, oracle, and wit, sitting by the ponds of apperception, baiting with the wrong request the vectors of his (and our) interest. For the waters are deeper than our ponds of apperception. Doubtless we would like to angle there, in the waters that are under the earth, in the waters of the deep unconscious, but we are apprehensive - we do not quite wish to risk what Auden elsewhere describes as the venture Into the snarl of the abyss That always lies just underneath Our jolly picnic on the heath Of the agreeable, where we bask, Agreed on what we will not ask, Bland, sunny and adjusted by The light of the accepted lie ... 2 It is just here at this juncture (between following to the bottom of the night or dropping down into the waters and his evident reluctance actually to do so) that I should like to probe briefly the strange ambivalence in Auden's poetic vision, which makes him at one level so penetrating and oracular, and at another so "irritating," so rhetorical and, at times, so hortatorily beside the point. I shall undertake this probe in two brief steps: the first, by way of Auden's dream as recounted for us in one of his last poems; and second, by way of his images and representative anecdotes and the contrast thus evoked between Auden and Rilke as representative poets of our time. I This is not to take anything from Auden's genius or from his greatness as a poet. "The best poet of the Auden generation is Auden," as William York Tindall puts it.3 His major poems, in the opinion of Louise Bogan, "constitute the most minute dissection of the spiritual illness of our day that any modern poet, not excluding Eliot, has given us."4 "What Auden brought to poetry," wrote John Peale Bishop, "was a new sensibility; his poems are the record of what has hurt and sustained that sensibility."5 Amos Wilder noted, back in 1952, that "Auden offers us the forum of the modern consciousness."6 As Auden remarks in his poem honoring a former professor, Nevill Coghill, upon his retirement, these and other estimates of his work are sufficient to "assure (us) that (he will) pass muster." Nevertheless, there has been a curious reluctance on the part of the critics generally to commit themselves overly far. One critic (David Daiches) described Auden as "this combination of prophet and clown."7 Monroe Spears, at the end of 2Auden, "New Year Letter," The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden (New York: Random House, 1954), p. 286. 3 Tindall, Forces in Modern British Literature (New York: Vintage Books, 1956), p. 46. 4 Bogan, Selected Criticism (New York: Noonday Press, 1955), p. 280. 5 Bishop, The Collected Essays of John Peale Bishop (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1948), p. 309. 6Wilder, Modern Poetry and the Christian Tradition (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1952), p. 196. 7 Daiches, Poetry and the Modern World (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1940), p. 228.</page><page sequence="4">138 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER his excellent book on The Poetry of W. H. Auden, speaks of him as "a religious poet who is also a clown, a virtuoso who is incorrigibly didactic, a satirist who is also a musician and lyricist. . ."8 And Louis Untermeyer, obviously under the influence of Auden's own verve and rhetorical elan, described him as a "protean poet, a capricious artist delighting in straight-face frivolities and a probing spirit torn between agnosticism and blind belief, a superb rhetorician rich in learning and a lover of extravagant oddities, a dramatic lyricist and a natural dialectician - in short a poet who is equally adept at sheer fooling and pure enchantment."9 It is interesting to see how, in his late book of poems (City Without Walls), Auden views himself somewhat more modestly, though acknowledging at the same time his logistical pranks and wizardry. He classifies himself with the Horatian tradition: You thought well of your Odes, Flaccus, and believed they would live, but knew, and have taught your descendants to say with you: "As makers go, compared with Pindar or any of the great foudroyant masters who don't ever amend, we are, for all our polish, of little stature, and as human lives, compared with authentic martyrs like Regulus, of no account. We can only do what it seems to us we were made for, look at this world with a happy eye but from a sober perspective."'0 Which brings us to his dream. He tells us ("Forty Years On") that For three nights running now I have had the same dream of a suave afternoon in Fall. I am standing on high ground, looking out westward over a plain run smoothely by Jaguar farmers. In the eloignment, a-glitter in the whelking sun, a sheer-bare cliff concludes the vista. At its base I see, black, shaped like a bell-tent, the mouth of a cave by which (I know in my dream) I am to make my final exit, 8 Spears, The Poetry of W. H. Auden, The Disenchanted Island (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963), p. 339. 9 Untermeyer, Modern British Poetry (combined mid-century edition, with Modern American Poetry) (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1950), p. 430. 10 Auden, "The Horatians," in City Without Walls and Other Poems (New York: Random House, 1969), p. 28.</page><page sequence="5">W. H. AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 139 its roof so low it will need an awkward duck to make it, "Well, will that be so shaming?" I ask when awake, "Why should it be? When has Autolycus ever solemned himself?"'' It is not difficult to see, on the face of it, that the dream is an anxiety dream, a pre-figuration of death, the cavern being the grave, the return to Mother Earth. But we know also that the cave is an initiation symbol. When it appears in the side of a mountain, one is invited to enter and to find the treasure that awaits within. In Jungian psychology it relates to the Mother Archetype, a womb symbol, and from it one may be reborn from the deep Self. In the initiation of the North American shamans, it is in the caves that the candidates meet their helping spirits. Monroe Spears has told us about Auden's "obsession with caves."12 The labyrinth which overlaps symbolically with the cave in psychical function appears many times. In Auden's book, About the House (1966), two cave poems appear. The first, "The Cave of Making," begins promisingly: For this and for all enclosures like it the archetype is Weland's Stithy, an antre more private than a bedroom even...13 But while this "antre" (cave, cavern) is the covering term assigned to the poet's study, the archetype appropriate to it is the "stithy" (forge), not the cave itself. In the second, "The Cave of Nakedness," the cave is a bedroom, a place for lovers and dreams and sleep and intimations of death; but the poem concludes with a brief paean to sunrise when he, she, or both ensemble, emerge from a private cavity to be reborn, reneighbored in the Country of Consideration.14 (In the previous poem, death is allegorized as the "Country of Unconcern.") Thus in Auden's late work, the house as a kind of cave, or symbolic womb, becomes a central image. Bachelard, in his Poetics of Space, relates the house- image to the Mother-Archetype. He quotes a relevant passage from Jung: Here the conscious acts like a man who, hearing a suspicious noise in the cellar, hurries to the attic and, finding no burglars there decides, consequently, that the noise was pure imagination. In reality, this prudent man did not dare venture into the cellar.'5 The cellar obviously refers to the unconscious and to our fear of it. A visitor to Auden at his home in Austria wrote (in 1971): I IAuden, "Forty Years On," in City Without Walls, pp. 44-45. 12 Spears, The Poetry of W. H. Auden, p. 11. '3 Auden, About the House (New York: Random House, 1965), p. 8. 14 Ibid., p. 34. 15 Bachelard, The Poetics of Space (New York: Orion Press, 1964), p. 19.</page><page sequence="6">140 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER Every morning and most afternoons in Kirchstetten, Auden mounts an outside staircase to his cluttered study - a small room adjacent to a larger empty loft set off by a warning sign in German: "BE CAREFUL! RAT POISON!"'6 Apparently Auden's house in Austria had both a cellar and an attic; but the poems devoted to these ("Down There" and "Up There") are pleasant, descriptive, and for the most part literal and anecdotal. Something of the Freudian subconscious may be gleaned from the following: Self-walled, we sleep aloft, but still, at safe anchor. Ride there on caves...17 The poet goes on to describe how, "deep in Mother Earth," we store things "in barrels, bottles, jars. .. ." But this is not repressive, and the mood of anecdotal fantasy takes over. The attic poem, "Up There," is even less susceptible to psychoanagogical reading; and one is reminded of Bachelard's remark that in the attic one's fears are easily "rationalized." Again and again one feels that Auden's poetic cleverness and virtuosity are a kind of rationalization and rhetorical cover employed with accomplished dexterity to turn the consciousness away from the noises in the cellar. In an early essay (published in 1939) Delmore Schwartz accused Auden of having two voices. One voice, he said, "is that of the clever guy, the Noel Coward of literary Marxism. ..... let us call this voice the Ego, thus using terminology in which the poet himself is interested." The other voice will then have to be called the Id, from which we get many images of import and power. This voice is "a kind of sibyl" (who prophesied, it will be recalled, from in front of a cave, or labyrinth). Schwartz preferred the poet of the Id to the poet of the Ego. The Id with its images is far ahead of the Ego, which "is merely clever and ingenious." As he anticipated Auden's development as a poet, everything would depend, as he saw it, upon Auden's ability to break with the "public poet.. .fashioned by the conscious will" and to return to "the role of obedience to the passive, subconscious self' with its images of power and import.'18 It is interesting to follow Auden's development in the light of this prognostication. In one of Auden's better early poems, entitled (under some influence, we assume, from Paul Tillich's earlier work) "Kairos and Logos," we find these lines: Night and the rivers sang a chthonic love, Destroyer of cities and the daylight order ... .9 The chthonic voices from below are seen here as destructive, while order belongs to the daylight, to the rational part. Here emerges also Auden's symbol of the City, for him the symbol of civilization and order. It is perhaps the most pervasive 16 Alan Levy, "On Audenstrasse," The New York Times Magazine, August 8, 1971, p. 36. 17 Auden, "Down There," in About the House, p. 14. 18 Schwartz, "The Two Audens," in Selected Essays ofDelmore Schwartz, ed.

AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 141 symbol in his poetry. It persists to the end. It is modelled initially on the Greek polis, which imitates the order in the heavens; later it receives a Christian valorization by way of Augustine's civitas terrena vis-a-vis the civitas caelestis. To set in order - that's the task Both Eros and Apollo ask... he says in "The New Year Letter.'"20 And in his later poem, "Memorial for the City," we see Adam still "waiting for His City."21 The whole question here, of course, is what is concealed behind the word order. What kind of order is supposed? Law, nature, mimesis, etc., may well belong to the "Aristotelian City"; but the resonances of these terms as used by Auden, along with order, will, administration, etc., (plus his appeal to Horace) often sound less Greek than Roman. It is fascinating, in the light of these evidences, to turn to Auden's elaborate interpretation of Wordsworth's dream, which he expounds in The Enchafed Flood. Wordsworth, seated in a rocky cave and facing sea-ward while reading Don Quixote, falls asleep and dreams. He is in the desert, where he is met by a Bedouin who resembles Don Quixote. The Bedouin has two treasures, a stone and a shell. The stone is geometric truth; the shell is Poetic Truth. It is a truth built by passion which itself Is highest reason in a soul sublime (for it is) a god, yes many gods (has) voices more than all the winds (and is) a joy, a consolation and a hope. .. .22 The shell, says Wordsworth, is more valuable than the stone; but, when held to the ear in his dreams, it foretells a great deluge about to overwhelm the earth, and the dreamer sees the Bedouin hurrying away across the desert on his dromedary with "the fleet waters of the drowning world in chase of him." The dreamer then awakes in terror. Auden aligns the stone with the desert, and the shell with the sea. He recognizes the dangers of inundation from the unconscious, but not through benefit of Jung. It is rather that one must be a sublime soul to ride out the storms of Poetic Truth. Later, however, Jung slips in undetected by way of Robert Penn Warren's masterful analysis of The Ancient Mariner, under which influence Auden aligns Day and the Sun with consciousness and the Paternal Principle and Night and the Moon with the Unconscious and the Maternal Principle. After pursuing these symbolic images through innumerable literary embodiments, Auden attempts to distinguish between the ego (which is aware of the self as given) and the self, a sort of vehicle of existence and potentiality. "As freely owning a self, (the ego) desires a self of which it can approve. As solitary it desires to be approved of for the self it has. This approval must have absolute authority ... (Therefore) the ego desires a God."23 20 Ibid., p. 266. 21 Auden, Nones (New York: Random House, 1951), p. 43. 22 Auden, The Enchafed Flood (New York: Random House, 1950), p. 43. 23 Ibid., p. 121.</page><page sequence="8">142 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER The ego, therefore, has three tasks: (1) To know the self and the world, as they exist now. (2) To know the true God and what He requires the ego to realize in the self as he knows it. (3) To obey these commands.24 This is a strange and curiously vague psychology. Clearly it is not Jungian. There is here no deep Unconscious in the Jungian sense, and no deep Psyche either on which the Ego depends and with which it seeks an integration (or through which it seeks its Individuation). But it is scarcely a Freudian psychology either. What has happened is that Kierkegaard - the Kierkegaard of the Stages and the Sickness Unto Life - has been smuggled in to supplement and undergird Freud; but it is Kierkegaard without the understanding of the Self having been properly understood or integrated into the argument - the view, namely, that the self becomes a self by relating itself to itself in a positive relation, that is, by relating itself transparently to the power that posited it.25 Meanwhile, the City has made its appearance; and both the stone and the shell are seen as the means through which the True City is built. Which brings us to the book's surprising denouement: We live in a new age in which the artist neither can have such a unique heroic importance nor believes in the Art-God enough to desire it, an age, for instance, when the necessity of dogma is once more recognized, not as a contradiction of reason and feeling, but as their ground and foundation, in which the heroic image is not the nomad wanderer through the desert or over the ocean, but the less exciting figure of the builder, who renews the ruined walls of the city.26 The conclusion is arbitrary and unveils the entire project as an elaborate tour deforce or, better, what Bachelard described as a "rationalization" from the attic. What we are to note here is that Auden's dream of the cave comes too late for him to enter and possess the treasure that had there awaited him; that he tends to remain, in Delmore Schwartz's terms, predominantly the poet of the Ego; that he fears the chthonic voices as destructive powers and opts for daylight order as the poet's task; that he rationalizes the symbols of depth (as in the case of Wordsworth's dream) in the direction of "building the city," and manipulates Freud through Kierkegaard in such a way as to subordinate the aesthetic to the ethical and the religious, thus conserving his poetic vocation as moralist at the crossroads between time and eternity, the civitas terrena and the civitas caelestis. II The effect of this on Auden's poetics will be seen the moment we turn to the second term in Auden's dream which came when he awoke and reflected that death would be rather awkward and embarrassing for a poet. But why should it be shameful, he reflects, and adds - "When has Autolycus ever solemned himself?" 24 Ibid. 25 Cf. Soren Kierkegaard, The Sickness Unto Death, trans.

AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 143 Who was Autolycus, that Auden should so designate himself? He was, in the first place, the son of Hermes - Hermes the thief and trickster and messenger of the gods. He was, in the second place, the grandfather of Ulysses, and not under the most laudable of circumstances. And when Hercules was reaching young manhood, Autolycus gave him boxing lessons; "Auden moves fast," wrote Schwartz, in the essay already cited, "like a good boxer!" It is under this modest guise that Auden sees himself in this poem: "all I had," he writes, "was the courtier's agility to adapt my rogueries to the times. It sufficed.... *"27 Auden's "rogueries" can best be seen in his deployment of images and metaphors, in his wit, and in his presiding anecdotes. Auden's metaphors are odd. It is often remarked that his technique derives, in part at least, from Rilke. Rilke's method, Auden held, was the opposite of the Elizabethans who aimed at anthropomorphic identification, and different from the Metaphysical poets, who used wit and the intellectual conceit. Rilke begins with things. He thinks in physical rather thah in intellectual terms. He provides (as Auden also attempts to do) a psychical geography. But somehow Auden's things lose their thinghood in his landscapes, and somehow his landscapes are empty because abstract. In a late poem he confesses to having heaped, in his early days, abstract noun upon abstract noun.28 When he describes, in his "Letter to Lord Byron," the "map of all my youth," with its "mental mountains and the psychic creeks/ The towns of which the master never speaks,"29 little is communicated. The terms lack specificity: they are not things, they are intellectual counters progressively emptying the intended word of content. When the strategy succeeds, as in his poem to Edward Lear, the effect is beautiful: And children swarmed to him like settlers. He became a land.30 When the strategy fails the effect is baffling and annoying: We are easy to trap, Being Adam's children, as thirsty For mere illusion still as when the first Comfortable heresy crooned to The proud flesh founded on the self-made wound, And what we find rousing or touching Tells us little and confuses us much.3' That is the difficulty: it tells us little and confuses us much! It is because of this that Auden's metaphors turn outward, whereas those of Rilke turn inward and create 27 Auden, "Forty Years On" in City Without Walls, p. 43. It would appear that Auden came by this happy identification by way of Shakespeare. In The Winter's Tale we find "Autolycus, a Rogue." Autolycus says of himself: "My father named me Autolycus; who being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles" (Act iv, Sc. 3). The name means literally "very wolf' (Graves), compounding abtr6 (self, very, the same) and X6KoV (a wolf, a person of wolf-like character). 28 Auden, "Eulogy," in City Without Walls, p. 18. 29 Auden, 11. 24-26, Letters from Iceland (London, 1937). 30 The Collected Poetry, p. 77. 31 Auden, "Music is International," Nones, pp. 72-73.</page><page sequence="10">144 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER what he called the Weltinnerenraum - that inner world-space. Again when Auden writes But few have seen Jesus and so many Judas the Abyss...32 the abyss for Auden has become a moral category and not a metapsychical one. Part of this is due to Auden's distrust of metaphor: No metaphor, remember, can express A real historical unhappiness...33 But Auden distrusts metaphor because he distrusts art: Art is not life and cannot be A midwife to society...34 But for Rilke it is just the opposite: "we are the bees of the invisible!" Here is the time for the Tellable, here is its home. Speak and proclaim...... Praise the world to the Angel, not the untellable: you Can't impress him with the splendour you've felt... Show him Some simple thing, remoulded by age after age, till it lives in our hands and eyes as a part of ourselves.35 What this boils down to in Auden's use of metaphor is that the terms in comparison tend to function allegorically and interact in such a way as mutually to enervate the images of their existential virtue: they intellectualize the relation (between the terms) according to a scale of values or beliefs that remains external to the terms in the comparison. They aim to formulate recognitions at the level of Ego-consciousness; they rarely evoke depth recognitions. We should bear in mind constantly the maxim (Wheelwright) that "what matters in a metaphor is the psychic depth at which the things of the world ... are transmuted by the cool heat of the imagination."36 But the very things that tell against Auden in his use of metaphor tell wondrouslyfor him in his use of wit. Here both Freud and Kierkegaard support him, and his own genius is free to romp and scintillate as outrageously as it pleases. Through wit and cleverness the Freudian subconscious can bypass the censorship 32 Auden, "Autumn 1940," The Collected Poetry, p. 102. 33 Auden, "The Truest Poetry Is the Most Feigning," The Shield of Achilles (New York: Random House, 1955), pp. 44. 4 Auden, "New Year Letter," The Collected Poetry, p. 267. 35 Rilke, Duino Elegies, trans.

Poetry here is essentially a game, a skill. There is a game called cops and robbers; there is none called saints and sinners.37 As a game, it can be played lightly, dalliantly: George the Third Ought never to have occurred. One can only wonder At so grotesque a blunder.38 T. S. Eliot is quite at a loss When clubwomen bustle across At literary teas, Crying: "what, if you please, Did you mean by The Mill on the Floss?"39 So far the clerihew and the limerick. But wit can also probe deeply at the crossroads of our ultimate antinomies, and there unmask our ego-pretensions, our egos complying: For, given Man, by birth, by education, Imago Dei who forgot his station, The self-made creature who himself unmakes, The only creature ever made who fakes, With no more nature in his loving smile Than in his theories of a natural style, What but tall tales, the luck of verbal playing, Can trick his lying nature into saying That love, or truth in any serious sense, Like orthodoxy, is a reticence.40 Thus art and poetry are frivolous (to use the term which Auden takes from Kierkegaard) and only religion is highly serious; but ... hidden in (its) hocus-pocus, There lies the gift of double focus. That magic lamp which looks so dull And utterly impractical Yet, if Aladdin use it right, Can be a sesame to light.41 37 Auden, "Postscript: The Frivolous &amp; the Earnest," The Dyer's Hand and Other Essays (New York: Random House, 1962), p. 432. 8 Alan Levy, "On Audenstrasse," The New York Times Magazine, August 8, 1971, p. 36. 39 Auden, Homage to Clio (New York: Random House, 1960), p. 90. 40 Auden, "The Truest Poetry Is the Most Feigning," The Shield of Achilles, p. 46. 41 Auden, "New Year Letter," The Collected Poetry, p. 290.</page><page sequence="12">146 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER Nevertheless, as Auden points out in the speeches of Caliban, in "The Sea and the Mirror," we must not be misled into thinking that our awareness of the gap between what we are and what we ought to be is a bridge.42 We are only made aware that the gap is there - a negative disclosure. How different this Kierkegaardian view is from that of the poet H61derlin, for whom the writing of poetry seemed to be the most innocent of occupations, a game almost; whereas in reality it is the most dangerous of possessions, for it is through language that the poet names the gods - on which Heidegger has commented that "poetry is the act of establishing by the word and in the word ... Existence is fundamentally 'poetic.'. . . And that our existence is fundamentally poetic.... cannot in the last resort mean, that it is really only a harmless game."43 It is much the same with Auden's representative anecdotes, of which there are four (the story of the City is not one of them) - the story of Adam, the detective story, the fairy story, and the story of Orpheus. The first two belong to the poetry of the Ego, the latter two to the poetry of the Id. And it is here that the final issue is joined. The story of Adam is by all odds the most pervasive of the four. Adam is antecedent to any act of ours. His crime was (1) a legalistic one: Could not one almost say that the Cold serpent on the poisonous tree Was l'Nsprit de gbometrie, That Eve and Adam till the Fall Were totally illogical, But as they tasted of the fruit The syllogistic sin took root?44 It was also (2) an error: Since Adam, being free to choose, Chose to imagine he was free To choose his own necessity, Lost in his freedom, Man pursues The shadow of his images. .. .45 It was also (3) a rebellion of a special kind: For as long as he was in Paradise he could not sin by any conscious intention or act: his as yet unfallen will could only rebel against the truth by taking flight into an unconscious lie; he could only eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil by forgetting that its existence was a fiction of the Evil One, that there is only the Tree of Life.46 42 Auden, "The Sea and the Mirror," The Collected Poetry, p. 400. 43 Martin Heidegger, Existence and Being, with an intro. by Werner Brock (London: Vision Press, 1949), p. 306, "Holderlin and the Essence of Poetry." 44 Auden, "New Year Letter," The Collected Poetry, p. 279. 45 Auden, "For the Time Being," The Collected Poetry, p. 420. 46 Ibid., p. 450.</page><page sequence="13">W.

Therefore, see without looking, hear without listening, breathe without asking; The Inevitable is what will seem to happen to you purely by chance; The Real is what will strike you as really absurd; Unless you are certain you are dreaming, it is certainly a dream of your own; Unless you exclaim - "There must be some mistake" - you must be mistaken.47 This is der Mensch im Widerspruch - Man in contradiction! - of existentialist neo-orthodox theology. It rests, as Auden knew well, upon the dogma of Original Sin, and was perhaps never expressed better than by Auden in his Oratorio, For the Time Being. But Rilke knew it also from the human side: Who's turned us round like this, so that we always do what we may, retain the attitude of someone who's departing.... we live our lives, for ever taking leave.48 Auden sees the tragic consequences of this flight from reality; Rilke sees its pathos. For Auden, our compounded flights from reality bring about the social crime. Where the Arcadian and the Utopian meet, there is murder! It lures us all; even the best, Les hommes de bonne volonte, feel Their politics perhaps unreal And all they have believed untrue, Are tempted to surrender to The grand apocalyptic dream 47 Ibid., p. 412. 48 Rilke, Duino Elegies VIII, p. 71.</page><page sequence="14">148 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER In which the persecutors scream As on the evil Aryan lives Descends the night of the long knives.. .49 Auden's fascination with the detective story is but an extension and subordinate theme of Adam's story. The situation of our time Surrounds us like a baffling crime. There lies the body half undressed, We all had reason to detest, And all are suspects and involved Until the mystery is solved... Who is trying to shield whom? Who left a hairpin in the room? Why did the watchdog never bark? Why did the footsteps leave no mark? Yet where the Force has been cut down To one inspector dressed in brown, He makes the murderer whom he pleases And all investigation ceases. Yet our equipment all the time Extends the area of the crime Until the guilt is everywhere .....o50 We continually seek a scapegoat, thinking that if we can pin the guilt on someone, the innocence of the rest of us is established. Not so, says Auden: we all participate in mankind's collective crime. But it is to be remarked that Auden, through his craft, is more successful in pointing to the crime than he is in solving it. He thereby runs the risk, as does all dogma, of committing the very legalistic crime he would resolve. For it is in the nature of all theology that construes itself in terms of theo- logic instead of theo-poiesis that it commits the syllogistic sin. It sacrifices its mythopoeic base in storial forms to the literalizations of dogmatic forms; it lapses from an ontology of metapoetics to the intellectualisms of Western metaphysics. Such a poet's appeal to dogma becomes an appeal outside his craft: which is to commit the sin of lbse majeste against his vocation. By the same token the mythologem of Adam loses its virtue when no longer held mythopoeically. Kierkegaard understood this perhaps better than most of his epigones: "All human speech," he wrote, "even the divine speech of the Holy Scriptures about spiritual matters, is essentially metaphorical . . . . the essence of the spirit is the quiet, whispering secrecy of the metaphorical - to one who has ears to hear with."'51 49 Auden, "New Year Letter," The Collected Poetry, p. 273. 50 Ibid., pp. 271-72. 5' Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, trans.

AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 149 Perhaps this is the reason why the fairy story has held its fascination for Auden throughout his years. Fairy tales, as Marie von Franz has indicated,"are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes."52 Their images are archetypal, and provide many clues for our understanding of the processes going on in the deep psyche. Auden is intrigued by those tales in which the third son (he was himself the third son in his family) goes on a quest after his brothers have failed, and who, by virtue of his naivete and innocent trust, succeeds in finding the treasure or rescuing the princess. In the course of this venture, the hero may encounter ogres, dragons, square castles, climb glassy mountains, have encounters at the crossroads; but Auden is intrigued by the undisclosed secret in all of these quests. Like Alice in Wonderland, there is a door through which he would pass into the Garden. Marie von Franz goes on to remark: After working for many years in this field, I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavor to describe one and the same psychic fact ... This unknown fact is ... the Self. . .53 It may be worthy of notice that in all of Auden's poetic references to the fairy tale, the adventure which he follows is always a lateral one: he never enters the cave like Aladdin, nor is he ever swallowed by beasts (like Eliot's dismembered hero in Ash Wednesday, or like Jonah in the belly of the fish). Perhaps this explains why the fourth story, that of Orpheus, is the anecdote that is not there. Auden writes one poem on Orpheus. In it he asks two questions: "what does the song (of Orpheus) hope for?" and "what will the dance do?"54 He ignores Orpheus' descent into the underworld, where through his song the underworld is enraptured and, with Eurydice, he is permitted to mount more singingly, mount more praisingly back into the pure relation... as Rilke says.55 And as for the dance, it is Rilke who exclaims, in his Sonnets to Orpheus, that "Song is existence!"... and we must learn to "Dance the Orange!" There are few references to Orpheus in Auden's poetry. There is Quant's speech, in The Age of Anxiety,56 and the reference in Memorial for the City, in which "Our Weakness" speaks: I heard Orpheus sing: I was not quite as moved as they say."5 52 Marie-Louise von Franz, An Introduction to the Interpretation of Fairy Tales (New York: Spring Publications, 1971), p. 1. 53 Ibid., p. 2. 54 Auden, "Orpheus," The Collected Poetry, p. 158. 55 Rilke, Sonnets to Orpheus, trans.

His sonnets of quest are modelled on those of Rilke: they are Rilkean sonnets. III One is inclined to agree with Nathan Scott when, in his fine essay on Auden, he observes that almost nowhere in Auden's poetry does he simply stare and look at the created world, in amazement and expectancy and adoration and praise.58 But there are signs in Auden's later work that his cerebral obduracy was beginning to relent. The poems are no longer theological in any explicit sense. He even gives an ear to "Bird-Language": Trying to understand the words Uttered on all sides by birds, I recognize in what I hear Noises that betoken fear. Though some of them, I'm certain, must Stand for rage, bravado, lust, All other notes that birds employ Sound like synonyms for joy.59 Here he has come quite simply upon the circumstance of praise. And again, surprisingly, in a review of a book by Loren Eiseley, he quotes at length the professor-scientist's unexpected encounter with a fox cub: The creature was very young. He was alone in a dread universe. I crept on my knees around the prow and crouched beside him....... .... Here was the thing in the midst of the bones, the wide-eyed innocent fox inviting me to play, with the innate courtesy of its two fore-paws placed appealingly together, along with a mock shake of its head. The universe was swinging in some fantastic fashion around to present its face, and the face was so small that the universe itself was laughing. It was not time for human dignity. It was time only for the careful observance of amenities written behind the stars ... On impulse I picked up clumsily a whiter bone and shook it in teeth that had not entirely forgotten their original purpose. Round and round we tumbled for one ecstatic moment ... For a moment I had held the universe at bay by the simple expedient of sitting on my haunches before a fox-den and tumbling about with a chicken bone. It is the gravest, most meaningful act I shall ever accomplish, but, as Thoreau once remarked of some peculiar errand of his own, there is no use reporting it to the Royal Society. 58 Scott, Four Ways of Modern Poetry (Richmond: John Knox Press, 1965), p. 89. 59 Auden, "Bird-Language," City Without Walls, p. 38.</page><page sequence="17">W. H. AUDEN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRAISE 151 Whereupon Auden concludes his review: "Thank God, though, Dr. Eiseley has reported it to me. Bravo! say I."60 Here too he has stumbled upon the circumstance of praise. What we must say, then, is simply that the whole of Auden's poetry, taken as a symbolic form, is an anecdote of quest in a time between the times. From time to time I think I see beneath his antic disposition a lonely child wanting to be found. In his several ordeals, he appeals to dogma--Marxian, Freudian, Kierkegaardian, Athanasian - whereas his contra-type, Maria Rilke, sees religion as a direction of the heart, and would bring us into the presence of the gods or would bring the gods to presence. Auden brings us sharply and realistically upon the dark night of the long knives; Rilke brings us to the dark night of "eternal blossoming." Auden, disesteeming his poetic voice, confronts the human situation as a problem, an occasion for wit and analysis; Rilke looks upon the human situation as a mystery to be marveled at and accepted. Whoever [says Rilke], within poetic creation, is initiated into the fabulous wonders of our depths ..... must arrive at developing for himself in marveling one of the most essential applications of his spirit ..... It is one of the original inclinations of my disposition to accept the mysterious as such, not as something to be unmasked, but rather as the mystery that, to its innermost being, and everywhere, is thus mysterious, as a lump of sugar is sugar throughout.6' Yet both poets, each after his fashion, were seeking the circumstance of praise. Wrote Auden: Praise, tongue, the Earthly Muse By number and by name In any style you choose, For nimble tongues and lame Have both found favor; praise Her port and sudden ways, Now fish-wife and now queen, Her reason and unreason; Though freed from that machine, Praise her revolving wheel Of appetite and season... Although your style be fumbling, Half stutter and half song, Give thanks however bumbling, Telling for Her dear sake To whom all styles belong The truth She cannot make.62 And Rilke, to much the same effect, but in his very different voice: 60 Forewords &amp; Afterwords, Selected by Edward Mendelson (New York: Vintage Books, 1974), p. 473. 61 Rilke, Letters of Rainer Maria Rilke, vol. 2: 1910-1926, trans. Jane Bannard Greene and M. D. Herter Norton (New York: W. W. Norton, 1948), p. 343. 62 Auden, "Precious Five," Nones, pp. 78-79.</page><page sequence="18">152 STANLEY ROMAINE HOPPER O tell us, Poet, what you do? - I praise, But the dark, the deadly, the desperate ways, How do you endure them - how bear them? - I praise. But the nameless, anonymous - which no word portrays - What do you call that, Poet, nevertheless? - I praise. From whence is your right, your assumed role essays, To be sincere in each mask? - I praise. And you know the stillness, and the passionate blaze, As of star, and of storm? - Because I praise.63 But enough of these critical quibbles. Let us be grateful to Auden for his craft and his wit and his genius and his wisdom. Orpheus too was dismembered. And perhaps Auden was an Orpheus precisely because he was not an Orpheus, since the descent to the underworld takes many forms. Let our concluding word, then, be from Rilke's Orphic voice to that other voice, however the gods may esteem it: He is one of those staying messengers, Who still holds far into the doors of the dead bowls of fruit worthy of praise.64 63 "O0, tell us, Poet, what you do?" in Rainer Maria Rilke, Poems, trans.
