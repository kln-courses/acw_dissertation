W. Young, and S. W. Alderson FOR MANY YEARS THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY has used anthropomorphic (human-like) dummies as an aid to under- standing what happens to a human being involved in car crashes. The first dummies used for this purpose were actually designed for the U.S. Air Force to simulate pilot emergency ejection from aircraft. Over the years these dummies have been supplied by two United States firms. It has been nec- essary to modify them to meet the needs of automotive test applications. As the tempo of automotive crash testing picked up more and more people became involved in these tests, the ex- change of reliable technical information became almost mandatory. Such exchange necessitated the development of a standard test device. Consequently, about three years ago the SAE Automotive Safety Committee initiated action to develop criteria for a series of standardized crash test dum- mies that would serve the specific needs of the automotive industry. This meant that specifications had to be prescribed for the size, shape, dynamic motions and construction of an anthropomorphic test device capable of being used for dy- namic testing. A Crash Test Dummy Task Force was estab- lished to develop these requirements, all of which are de- scribed in this paper. SIZE AND SHAPE The first decision made by the Task Force was that of determining the size of the test device. A review of past test experience and projected needs established that the most immediate requirement was for a single dummy of median size. The Task Force agreed that while additional smaller and larger devices might be required (to simulate smaller ABSTRACT - - - The SAE Recommended Practice J963 "Anthropomorphic Test Device for Dynamic Testing" describes a standard 50th percentile adult male anthropomorphic test dummy. For nearly three years the Crash Test Dummy Task Force worked with the limited data available in selecting values for the body dimensions and ranges of motion. The data for specifying the values of mass distribution were de- veloped experimentally as was a test procedure for deter- mining the dynamic spring rate of the thorax. 935</page><page sequence="2">936 J. A. STARKEY, ET AL. and larger human beings), the complexity of the tool dictated a concentrated effort on one size that would yield the maxi- mum benefit to a number of users. Therefore, the 50th per- centile male adult size was selected as the standard. At this point, a discussion of human sizing (anthropometry) is appropriate to assist one in understanding the basis for the selection of a series of component dimensions, i.e., knee height, buttock knee length, and sitting height, which are combined to make a whole. Since human beings come in assorted sizes, with a wide range of dimensional tolerances for limb lengths, for instance, the dimensional specifications of a single anthropomorphic device as representative of a wide population of human beings becomes an abstraction. Component dimensions, such as knee height, are expressed in terms of percentile. The term "percentile means that if you measure the knee height of 100 males and 60 (or 60%) of them have dimensions of 21.7 in. or less, then that figure represents a 60th percentile value. If 70 (or 70%) recorded dimensions of 22.0 in. or less, then 22.0 in. would be the 70th percentile knee height for that group of men, etc. You could then measure the buttock- to -knee length and in the same manner determine percentile for this characteristic. This procedure of measuring components is continued until all desired dimensions are obtained. Because percentiles can be determined for only one specific value at a time identical percentile of connecting parts cannot be added together to form say a leg length of the same percentile. This is, of course, not precisely true in the case of 50th percentile. In determining anthropometric dimensions for a human representation, it is also necessary to examine the human source of the data with regard to age, sex, national origin and occupation. Knowledge of the measuring techniques used in compiling the data is a valuable asset when com- paring or combining dimensions collected by various in- vestigators. It is not the intent of this paper to take each dimension selected by the Task Force and explain its derivation, since a copy of Recommended Practice SAE J963 Anthropomorphic Test Device for Dynamic Testing, is contained in the ap- pendix of this paper, and Table 1 of the Recommended Prac- tice identifies the source of each of the dimensions. How- ever, a general discussion of how the Task Force selected the sources is in order. Since anthropometry is a discipline distinct from that normally engaged in by engineers, the assistance of recog- nized experts in the field of anthropometry was sought. Two outstanding men in this field accepted the assignment, namely: H. T. E. Hertzberg, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, and Robert M. White, U. S. Army Natick Labs. The Task Force itself is made up of automotive engineers engaged in dy- namic testing, university and government researchers, and technical personnel from the two anthropomorphic dummy manufacturers in the United States. The Task Force furnished Messrs. Hertzberg and White a list of the desired dimensions and requrested that they make recommendations for values that would most nearly represent a 50th percentile adult civilian male between the ages of 16 and 70 years. After careful review of existing anthropo- metric data from a variety of sources, the participants met in a series of meetings to select those dimensions which were appropriate to the objective of describing a standard dynamic test device. It was abundantly clear that the only applicable civilian data were those contained in the Department of Health, Ed- ucation and Welfare's Public Health Service Report, Series 11, Number 8. However, this report contained less than half of the desired dimensions; the Task Force in selecting the remaining dimensions relied heavily on the recommenda- tions of Messrs. Hertzberg and White in accepting military data or adjusted data from other sources. Consideration was also given to the necessity of providing in the test device mechanical equivalents of human movement. One of the early dilemmas that faced the Task Force was that of deciding how many body dimensions were required to define adequately the body shape. After many lengthy deliberations, the group accepted the recommendation of their expert consultants on anthropometry that only the more important dimensions be specified and a master model be sculptured to describe the shape and remaining sizes. The master model is in the classical anthropometric seated erect position. The Task Force and its consultants agreed that the model should have non-descriptive face, hands and feet. However, dummy manufacturers may build the dummies with features resembling the human, providing the required dimensional limitations are held. The sculpting was ac- complished under the guidance of Mr. Hertzberg and the approved model will be cast in fiberglas for permanent record Fig. 1 - Model sculptured dummy</page><page sequence="3">FIRST STANDARD AUTOMOTIVE CRASH DUMMY 937 and reference. The three dimensional results of almost three years of effort can be seen in Fig. 1. RANGES OF MOTION Structural simulation of the human body in gross volume, mass and dimension is accomplished by the direct applica- tion of anthropometric data as design criteria. Similarly, the designed function of motion can be achieved by using the information provided by a variety of kinematic studies. Although both types of basic data normally have a wide range of variability due to factors of age, sex, structural dif- ferences and conditioning, there are significant differences between the accuracy of measurement techniques used in defining motion function and structural characteristics. These differences are amplified by recognizing the difficulty in the interpretation and application of motion data, since the best available information derived by static measuring tech- niques must be used to establish a dynamic motion capability. Specifically, while there is a reasonable and valid basis for selecting certain ranges of motion from data taken under static conditions to estimate a dynamic capability, there is no reliable way to estimate the degree of joint "stiffness" or tension because of insufficient data. The omission of joint "stiffness" values in SAE Recommended Practice J963 indicates a decision not to establish a set of arbitrary values. Realistically, we should recognize that joint stiffness can greatly alter the dynamic response of simulated body compo- nents individually and in combination. Therefore, it would seem appropriate to develop articular joints with a variable resistance to motion. The kinematic function of body motion is identified and described by the characteristics of flexibility and the degree of freedom available at the primary articular joints. Ranges of motion are measured at these joints in both single and composite, omnidirectional planes by voluntary movement or involuntary motion response to applied force. The primary simulated body joints identified as the ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, and shoulder are simple mechanical articula- tions. The human neck is an exception, involving a series of joints, and should be considered as a complex system which may be mechanically simplified without compromise to the desired function. The anatomical definitions of motion are diagramatically detailed in J963, along with the established values for range of motion. These values may be considered as conservative, representing data selected from a wide variety of population samples by age, sex, and physical characteristics and are modified to incorporate necessary design tolerances and to meet specific needs for human simulation. Data from surveys of groups having excessive motion capabilities were con- sidered in the established values but were carefully weighted to prevent an unrealistic bias toward atypical capabilities not representative of the general population. The necessity of using a test device (dummy) that simu- lates the human body components in gross size, shape, weight and kinematic function is apparent. Although some of the gross physical characteristics of the human have been copied, an exact duplication of the complex anatomical structure and articular function would be difficult and perhaps un- necessary. Some movements of the simulated test device may be best achieved mechanically by not duplicating the normal anatomical relationships of component structures, i.e. neck. MASS RELATIONSHIPS To be a valid test subject, an anthropomorphic test dummy must have the same kinematic response as the corresponding human. This requires the same distribution of mass between the various segments of the body and the same locations of centers of gravity in these segments and in the body as a whole. Accurate mass-distribution data are essential to the development of anthropomorphic test dummies. DATA SOURCES - The data utilized in these specifica- tions of the first dummies was derived from the studies of Braune and Fischer in 1889 and of Fischer in 1906 and later from a study made by Dempster in 1955. The Braune and Fischer study was based upon three cadavers, ranging in weight from 124-165 lb. The Dempster study was based Fig. 2 - Molding process</page><page sequence="4">938 J. A. STARKEY, ET AL. upon eight cadavers, ranging in weight from 110-158 lb. Neither group was representative of the average adult male but, in fact, was below average by weight. Even if the cadaver population had been satisfactory, the data would have been difficult to apply directly in dummy design because subsequent analyses showed that to match the cadaver mass distribution with that of the test dummy would be an approximation determined by the adjustments required by joint design. It is interesting to note that the Braune and Fischer data summarized the weights of individual body segments as per- centages of total body weight. The head was given as 6.95 % of the total body weight, which would make a 50th percentile head weigh about 11.4 lb, and a 95th percentile head weight about 15.1 lb. A rough estimate of the relative weights of 50th percentile and 95th percentile heads can be made by assuming the head to be spherical, so that the masses of the two heads would be proportional to the cubes of such di- mensions as circumferences. On this basis, if the 50th per- centile head weighed 11.4 lb, then the 95th percentile head would weigh 13.0 lb, not 15.1 lb. Mass- distribution data must be derived separately for various percentiles, rather than by extrapolation. It would be difficult, however, to find a single individual meeting all size and contour specifications of a selected percentile. METHODOLOGY - Phantoms (medical terminology for dummies) are used extensively in the field of radiation ther- apy to determine the dose distributions produced by various treatments. One condition for the dose distribution within a phantom to be the same as that within a corresponding patient is that the specific gravities of human skeletons, soft tissues, lung tissues and fat be duplicated in the phan- tom. Such a phantom will then have the same total mass and mass distribution as a human of the same size, shape, respiratory volume and skeletal weight. Natural human skeletons are employed in the construction of radiological phantoms. Pre-molded lungs with a specific gravity of .32 and of slightly less than median respiratory volume are inserted within the rib cage. The air spaces of the oro- nasal pharyngés, trachea and the stem bronchi are blocked off by wax inserts which are removed later. Thereafter, soft- tissue- equivalent material with a specific gravity of 1 is added to fill the mold. For greater accuracy spaces for subcutaneous fat are blocked off by clay. After the soft tissues have been cast, the clay is removed and the resulting spaces are filled with a plastic which has the speci- fic gravity of fat, about .90. Fig. 2 shows the molding pro- cess. This procedure (without simulation of fat) was performed for the head, torso and upper thighs of an Alderson Model VIP- 50 anthropomorphic test dummy. The molds used were taken from the master patterns of the test dummy, so the phantoms would have precisely the contours of the dummy. A skeleton of average weight was used, with its size selected to fit into the mold with normal separations between verte- brae, pelves and other bones. The completed phantom was sectioned by sawing into segments corresponding to the major mechanical segments of the dummy. Part 2: Its Parts, Performance, and Purposes By W. G. Cichowski, M. T. Krag, Julie H. Auerback, W. D. Horn, and W. J. Sobkow, Sr. COMPONENT OR SEGMENT REQUIREMENTS As already mentioned, test dummies were first developed for use by the military in the evaluation of pilot restraint systems and ejection devices. These first-generation dum- mies, one of which is shown in Fig. 3, had the configuration, weight distribution and limb motion of the human body, but otherwise were constructed primarily to withstand repeated usage in tests involving high impact forces. Whereas dur- ability was one of their virtues, they were grossly lacking in many human characteristics. For instance, they had no pelvic structure or spinal articulation. These deficiencies com- promised their usefulness in the evaluation of automotive restraint systems where kinematic realism is so essential, particularly with respect to jackknifing and submarining of the body. In recent years, emphasis has been placed on the develop- ment of improved anthropometric test devices. SAE Recom- mended Practice J 963, "Anthropomorphic Test Device for Dynamic Testing," reflects the results of this effort and sets forth the design requirements for the components and seg- ments of the most advanced of these devices. These require- ments are further described below. HEAD - The requirements for the head of this test device are described in the Appendix. The structure must be easily disassembled to allow for accessibility to ballasts and instru- mentation located in the cranial cavity. The supporting linkage (neck) must have sufficient torque adjustment to hold the head in an erect position when the test device is subjected to a horizontal acceleration of 2 g. An obvious shortcoming is the lack of specifications or description of neck motion or torque adjustments. Data required to ade- quately specify simulated human neck motion are not cur- rently available. This section will be revised as new tech- nology provides the required information. TORSO - The part of this design requirement dealing with the torso components recognizes that the test device will be used for evaluation of restraint systems, and in par- ticular, automotive lap and upper torso belts. This part of the design requirement is shown in the Appendix. These design requirements supplement the anthropometry</page><page sequence="5">FIRST STANDARD AUTOMOTIVE CRASH DUMMY 939 Fig. 3 - First-generation dummy Fig. 4 - Shoulder structure and mass distribution parameters and contribute to the use- fulness of the test device in studying jackknifing and sub- marining. Sound evaluation of restraint systems requires that the test device react to a crash situation similar to a human. Large variations in torso and pelvic structure, anthro- pometry, and mass distribution can influence jackknifing and submarining action. The requirement that the torso have shoulder sections geometrically and functionally similar to the human shoulder complex, shown in Fig. 4, is included Fig. 5 - Pelvic structure</page><page sequence="6">940 J. A. STARKEY, ET AL. so that the evaluation of upper torso harnesses which contact the shoulder section can be made. Rollout, slipout or hang- up as evaluated with a test device is meaningful only if the shoulder construction is representative of the human. TORSO ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC SECTION - The re- quirement that the abdominal section must be soft and pliable is an effort to simulate these characteristics of the human body. These requirements must remain broad in nature, until we learn how to specify thèse human characteristics. The pelvic structure is described as being similar to the human pelvis, as shown in Fig. 5. The contour and shape of the pelvis, the crest of the ilium in particular, is quite important when evaluating restraint systems such as a lap belt that applies force to that area. Since this area of the human body is regarded by some medical authorities as one of the strongest body structures, it is thus well suited to with- stand the force applied by a restraint system during a crash situation. The present recommended practice allows the test device to be built to a broad design specification while still provid- ing important performance parameters. It does not define basic dimensions or contours. This allows for innovation in dummy design while trying to simulate human structure and dynamic response. Data required to more specifically define an ideal torso-pelvic construction is not commonly available to the automotive engineer. It is expected that these sections of the recommended practice will be updated as more infor- mation becomes available to us.

A test device with a rigid chest structure can produce unrealis- tic test results when used as an evaluation tool for impacting steering control systems. The spring rate for the thorax was obtained from results of tests conducted at Wayne State University by Messrs. Patrick, Gadd, and Kroell. Fig. 6 is a view of their test setup. Cadaver chest force and displacement were measured during impacts with a 6- in. diameter target. From these data, it was determined that the spring rate should be 900 lb ± 100 lb/in. in the deflection range of .75 to 1.0 in. This portion of the lo ad -deflect ion curve brackets the first major yield point (inflection point) of the tested cadaver thorax. The typical cadaver chest spring rate curve obtained from the Wayne State test is* shown in Fig. 7. Two methods are mentioned in the recommended practice to determine the thorax spring rate of the test device. One test method essentially duplicates the test procedure at WSU, using the fully assembled test device on an acceleration or deceleration sled. The second method permits the removal of the thorax assembly and employs a simple test fixture such as a drop tower (Fig. 8). The physical properties of the im- pact target, its impact location, and its alignment with the thorax are the same as those used at Wayne State University. The thorax assembly and mounting fixture weight of 22 ± 5 lb and impact velocity of 22 ±7 fps provides a tolerance for impact testing. Weight and velocity variations within the Fig. 8 - Drop tower for spring rate test above tolerances do not appreciably change the spring rate in the .75-1.0 in. deflection range. The thorax spring rate between 0 and .75 in., and the 1.00 in. to maximum chest deflection (shown in Fig. 7) are affected by the dynamic test tolerances. These portions of the curve are not defined and, therefore, allow the tester maximum flexibility during his test and evaluation program. The recommended practice further specifies that this deflection measurement shall be a measure of sternum movement relative to the spine only, and not the deflection of the target pad material. As ad- ditional information becomes available from test programs Fig. 9 - Pliable covering reveals impact marks Fig. 10 - Discontinuous covering at shoulder</page><page sequence="8">942 j. A. STARKEY, ET AL. with cadavers, it is anticipated that this section of the SAE recommended practice will be updated and revised. ARM AND LEG KINEMATICS - Arm and leg kinematics are defined in J- 963. In addition to defining ranges of mo- tion and segment dimensions, J- 963 specifies adjustable joints that can be made to hold a fixed position against an acceleration of 2 g in any direction. This degree of rigidity is necessary to keep the test device in position during the ac- celerations commonly encountered prior to impact, during crash tests. EXTERNAL COVERING, DURABILITY AND INSTRUMENTATION EXTERNAL COVERING - The section of SAE J963 that describes the external covering states, "The external cover- ing of the test device shall be soft, pliable, tear- resistant Fig. 11 - Skin material cross- section Fig. 12 - Dummy riding ejection seat (courtesy of Weber Aircraft Co. and Sierra Engineering Co.) and elastic." This specification was included for several reasons. A "skin-like" covering is desired so that frictional, flexure and lacerative characteristics can be simulated. Clothes are usually applied to the test device to simulate real- life friction characteristics between the test device and the seat or restraint system to produce proper collision performance. The covering should be soft and pliable so that impacts with objects might produce revealing marks, see Fig. 9. The soft covering also attenuates acceleration spikes on the traces obtained from instrumentation installed in the test device. Fig. 13 - Insides oí a test device</page><page sequence="9">FIRST STANDARD AUTOMOTIVE CRASH DUMMY 943 Fig. 14 - Instrumentation capabilities of a test device Fig. 15 - Head cavity for instrumentation mounting SAE J963 further states that "The covering may be dis- continuous as required for unrestricted motion, except at torso sections where restraint belts will be used with test device during impact tests." At the shoulder, for example, the total upper arm flexion and hypertension may include an arc up to 260 degi to have an external covering con- tinuous over this much travel would be both difficult and un- necessary, see Fig. 10. The pelvic area is an exception, since discontinuities in this area may influence the reaction of the test device with various restraint systems. Hence, a one mold design in the seated position has been developed for this area. Definitive specifications for the external cover- ing are not listed in J963 since the properties required are not known at this time. Fig. 11 shows a typical cross-section of the skin material used today. DURABILITY - Another aspect of the test device to con- Fig. 16 - Typical body cavities sider is its durability. The question of durability must be ap- proached first by considering the purpose of the test device. If the device is to simply ride an ejection seat, see Fig. 12, it should be built as strong as possible. But if the device is to be made so as to indicate overload through failure,</page><page sequence="10">944 J. A. STARKEY, ET AL. Fig. 17 - Removeable ballast then it must be made frangible. SAE J- 963 states that "To withstand repetitive testing, the test device shall be con- structed of durable high strength materials which shall result in a minimum of repair and replacement of parts." Of im- portance to the automotive test engineer at present is a de- vice that performs consistently and does not fail. Fig. 13 shows the rather robust insides of a present day test device. INSTRUMENTATION CAPABILITIES - The final topic under anthropomorphic s concerns the instrumentation capa- bilities of the test device. Fig. 14 shows an instrumented test device installed in a car just prior to test. We have been discussing above the indication of overload through component failure, but a reliable non-destructive method of determining loading is by measuring the loads, imposed on the test device, with accelerometers, loud cells, high speed film analysis or similar device and techniques. In order to accommodate instrumentation in the test de- vice, it is necessary to provide cavities such as the head cavity shown in Fig. 15 where the instrumentation can be mounted. SAE J963 states, "There shall be provision for internal placement of instrumentation in the head and thorax and pelvic sections. All instrument cavities shall be readily accessible. They shall contain removable ballast to establish initially specified masses and centers of gravity. Care shall be taken when installing instrumentation to maintain masses and centers of gravity specified in Table 2 and Fig. 2 and 3." Typical body cavities are shown in Fig. 16. In order to ad- here continuously to the mass and center of gravity require- ments spelled out in J963, each cavity contains ballast which can be removed easily when adding instmmentation. The ballast shown in Fig. 17 can be removed by the removal of its securing bolt.</page><page sequence="11">FIRST STANDARD AUTOMOTIVE CRASH DUMMY 945 APPENDIX A ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICE FOR DYNAMIC TESTING - SAE J963 SAE Recommended Practice Report of Automotive Safety Committee approved June 1968. 1. Scope- This SAE Recommended Practice describes and defines a standard anthropomorphic test device for use in both actual and simu- lated vehicle crash impact tests. This test device is designed to be used in the evaluation of vehicle interiors and restraint systems for vehicle occupants during various impact conditions.

These shall include the functional mechanical equivalents of the spinal column, rib cage and sternum, pelvis, joint articulations at the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and exterior com- ponent coverings. 4. Component or Segment Requirèments 4.1 Head- The head shall consist of composite structures that are geometrically similar to the human head. The basic structure shall have an accessible internal ballast and instrumentation cavity and a pliable external covering with appropriate surface contours. The con- necting and supporting structure for the head shall have the capability of maintaining an erect head position up to a horizontal acceleration of 2g. 4.2 Torso- The connecting and supporting structures shall allow the test device to maintain a simulated sitting position similar to that of a human occupant of a vehicle. The design of these connecting and supporting structures shall be such that during acceleration, the lap belt restrained test device will develop a forward jackknifing motion. 4.2.1 Toirso: Shoulder Sections- The shoulder structures shall be geometrically and functionally similar to the human shoulder complex. 4.2.2 Thorax: Spring Rate- The thorax dynamic impact load- de- flection spring rate shall be 900 ± 100 lb/in. This spring rate is deter- mined by dividing the force applied to the thorax by the deflection within the range of 0.75-1.0 in. 4.2.2.1 Determination of Thorax Spring Rate- The dynamic spring rate of the thorax may be determined using a complete test device with the thorax assembly only. When the complete test device is evaluated, a simulated forward impact of a seated occupant is used. When only the thorax assembly is used, its weight along with mount- ing fixture shall be 45 ± 5 lb. 4.2.2.2 Impact Target- The impact target shall be 6 in. in diameter with an optional 0.5 in. covering of padding material. The target shall be fixed to a stationary load cell. 4.2.2.3 Location of Center of Target- The center of impact on the sternum shall be on the vertical centerline at a point located 18 ± 0.5 in. from the top of the head of an erect test device. 4.2.2.4 Alignment of Impact Target- The impact target and load cell assembly shall be aligned so that the major force axis is normal to :j 'ir till' RNt 1 1 R ' " ' - " '" &gt; ' ' j c ļ ~ ^ fig. i-body centers of gravity, weights, and dimen- "■ ^ ~ SIONS (SEE TABLE 1)</page><page sequence="13">FIRST STANDARD AUTOMOTIVE CRASH DUMMY 947 %b' ' pp ¿V* vjj| GJ L i GJ L i , I ^ FIG. 2- RANGES OF MOTION (SEE TABLE 2) FIG.

All joints shall have adjustment features which can be set to hold the test device components in any position against an acceleration of 2g in any direc- tion. 5. External Covering- The external covering of the test device shall be soft, pliable, tear resistant, and elastic. The covering may be discon- tinuous as required for unrestricted motion, except at torso sections where restraint belts will be used with the test device during impact tests. 6 . Durability- T o withstand repetitive testing, the test device shall be constructed of durable, high strength materials which shall result in a minimum of repair and replacement of parts. 7. Instrumentation- There shall be provision for internal placement of instrumentation in the head and thorax and pelvic sections. All in- strument cavities shall be readily accessible. They shall contain re- movable ballast to establish initially specified masses and centers of gravity. Care shall be taken when installing instrumentation to main- tain masses and center of gravity specified in Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3.</page></plain_text>
