<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Milton, Poet of Duality by R. A. Shoaf. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985. Pp. 224. $17.00. Paradise Lost and the Rhetoric of Literary Forms by Barbara Kiefer Lewalski. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. 370. $32.50. These two recent books on Milton ought, one feels, to be more different from one another than they are. Lewalski's professes to be written from a perspective appreciative of, if not indeed one with, that of Renaissance liter ary theory. Shoaf's, by contrast, is informed by modern theory, especially semiotics, and is therefore offering to be something rather new. Yet both pro ceed by displacing properly formal or stylistic into moral considerations, as if (abstract, putatively Christian) morality furnished poetry with its obvious end. Many of the same dull neoChristian prejudices for which William Emp son castigated establishment Miltonists twenty-five years ago crop up yet again, and solemnly subsist if they cannot be said to thrive, in these books' mildly depressing pages. Yet one must always make distinctions, and Lewalski's book does have major virtues. Her central proposition is that Milton in Paradise Lost deliber ately deploys the whole gamut of forms comprising the loose and fluid hier archy that was the Renaissance genre system: "epic, tragedy, sonnet, verse epistle, funeral elegy, hymn, epigram, and many more." She holds that Mil ton invokes and practices this mixed and shifting, yet determinate system in order indirectly to inform and comment upon his Biblical material, judging this system and discriminating among its various forms even as it allows him to evaluate the elements of the sacred story. These propositions are certainly well worth arguing. It is unfortunate, then, that Lewalski does not so much argue her case as document it. Since it is "de liberateness" that needs to be shown, Lewalski ought to stress and think upon the indications of conscious manipulation, those explicit textual signals by which the genre system is made for the course of Paradise Lost into a rhet oric. Lewalski does underscore obvious generic cues; but all too often, she as sumes that the presence of a generic paradigm, or the presence of some element that might be associated with a paradigm, constitute evidence of Milton's deliberate use of form. This assumption having been made, the question then can easily become, "to what end this deliberate use of form?", and an argument about generic composition and "style" gives way to an— impressively indefatigable—exercize in moralizing Milton. This procedure is especially unsatisfactory when the moralizing argument clearly dictates the very documentation of genre, as it does for example in Lewalski's analysis of Milton's God. She begins with the general statement that God is the most generically multiplicitous character in the poem, and then makes this claim good in practice by broadening her definition of genre to the bursting point. One can accept that the dialogue between Father and Son in Book III is "a species of epic Concilia Deorum," and that this cues us to the dialogue's essential generic paradigm. But one cannot agree that the Son's offer to die for fallen man is romance because it recalls "deeds of brav 213</page><page sequence="2">214 Criticism, Vol. XXVIII, No. 2: Book Reviews ery and self-sacrifice inspired by erotic love and noble friendship." Why reach outside the epic for analogies to such an action? Again, the dialogue of Father and Son does indeed allude to a scene between Apollo and Phaethon in Ovid, as Lewalski points out; but an allusion to Ovid does not make Mil ton's poem metamorphic epic at this point. Lewalski goes on to argue that the Father-Son exchange is (among other things) tragicomedy (!), forensic de bate (a formal genre, she tells us), and finally "a species of Socratic dialogue." The doors of Lewalski's learned perception are thrown open, and it is festival time; if he were likened to a lamb in this section, then that would not only put the Son within the Revelations-genre, it would also make the poem georgic. Lewalski is considerably more accommodating than God is, and the reason is not far to seek. She wants to impart a slightly new twist to the old argument about God's proper unrepresentability: God's generic multiplicity, she tells us, reminds the reader that he cannot really be imagined, but only approximated to. The argument about Milton's deliberate use of genre here runs athwart Milton's evident intentions—which should be apparent to any one familiar with his peculiarly literalist doctrine of accommodation, accord ing to which it would be heretical and arrogant to distrust the anthropomorphic self-representations that God, in the Bible, has supplied to his saints. This theory accounts for what is in fact the comparative nakedness of Milton's God in Paradise Lost. Lewalski dresses God up, one feels, in order to cover over Milton's radical and presumptious familiarity with him, and in order to salvage a more coherent reading than the poem makes available. More important, however, than any individual misreadings induced by it, the procedure that turns a generic into a moralizing argument prevents Le walski from even raising the question as to how a rhetoric of genres is possi ble. The concept of such a rhetoric is as much a problem as it is a solution. Say that Milton does manipulate genre to such coherent ends as Lewalski proposes; the peculiar and salutary distance from genre that this manipulation is premissed upon still asks to be accounted for. If one regrets Lewalski's turn to moral exegesis, that is largely because her learning puts her in a better po sition than most to exposit the preconditions, and thus to explain the nature, of Milton's generic practice. In spite of lapses in the documentary argument, however, and in spite of the impropriety of the documentary slant, Lewalski's basic proposition is pretty well enforced. She does make a fairly strong case for the determinate presence and the deliberate manipulation in Milton's poem of the genre system associated with and most influentially put forward by the younger Scaliger. Even though she argues that Milton is operating strictly in terms of, or within, the Renaissance system, her book thus nonetheless raises the ques tion of how to relate Milton's indubitable return to the classics, and to classi cal epic—which takes place against and behind the back, so to speak, of the official system—with the Renaissance system itself. One may not be able to see Milton, at least in practice, making the Renaissance mistake of interpret ing the Aristotelian hamartia as a character flaw or a sin (a mistake that Le walski, who should know better, evidently repeats); still, Lewalski makes it more pressing to ask how Milton's avoidance of such an error was possible, and that is no inconsiderable accomplishment. It is less easy to come to terms with Shoaf s Milton, Poet of Duality, partly,</page><page sequence="3">Criticism, Vol. XXVIII, No. 2: Book Reviews 215 it should be granted, because he is attempting something fairly new and strange, at least to Milton criticism. The book concerns numbers (one and two especially), numerical puns ("impart," "impair," "atone," et. al,), and numerically related words ("sign," "justify") in Milton's major poetry—a cluster that Shoaf calls the "lexicon of duality." Shoaf draws eclectically upon elements of psychoanalytic and semiotic theory to fashion this numeri cal diction into a moral discourse centered upon true and false forms of iden tity. Milton's theology is thus translated into a curious species of numerological morality—curious mostly because of the emphasis on num bers, but also because this morality proves to have served Dante, Virgil, Plato (though against his will), Ovid, Chaucer, and other immortal Western artists before being refined under Shoaf's pen for all varieties of modern humanity (some groups may possibly have favored access, however; see p. 56, where Shoaf exonerates himself from the charge of making language Christian by claiming "only that Christ perfectly understood language—its vicariousness or mutuality or sacrificiality—and this, in large part, because he was a Jew"). The essential moral propositions would seem to run as follows. If one wants to be whole or really one (and one does), then one should recognize that one needs help from another. If one recognizes this, then one will be come part of a couple of some sort (whether this means a coupling of one and language, one and a wife, or one and God or Christ). One must join with another, must recognize one's duality, must make two, in order to be truly one, which is also then to be ordered, at least in relation to the second. Truly to recognize one's duality and be one and ordered always involves sacrifice (of one's independence, which is evidently presupposed). So unity is attained only through sacrifice. If one does not sacrifice, or sacrifices falsely, then . . . but I begin to feel that it is impossible to summarize this argument without seeming willfully to parody it, so I will let Shoaf teach false sacrifice, or sin, in his own words, which are taken from a reading of Sin's speech to Satan toward the end of Book II of Paradise Lost: Sin (who is followed by a sign) is a mirror for Satan and his (and eve ryman's) narcissism. Sin is thus properly defined as a corruption of dif ference, or, very strictly speaking, of apartness .... Through the imagery of narcissism, Milton is recognizing that sin is the illusion and confusion in which one attempts to be one without ever becoming two or different from itself, merely copying itself endlessly instead. (And this, if we stop to reflect on it, is precisely pride, the chief of sins and hence the loneliest.) Sin is always a frustration of difference: in the sin of lust, for example, the difference of the other's body is only an illu sion to the lustful, for the lustful wants the other's body as his or her own and reduces it to his or her own, thereby confusing it with his or her own. The problem with such a passage, and with Shoaf's reading of Milton, is not just that the morality extracted is so general that it can be of little rele vance to Milton in particular. Nor is it only that the modern theory alluded to is almost always used to gloss the content, rather than to explain the form, of Milton's poem. The bigger problem is that the extreme emphasis upon num</page><page sequence="4">Criticism, Vol. XXVIII, No. 2: Book Reviews 216 bers is properly meaningless. The modern sources from whom Shoaf pulls his number theory (Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze, et al.) do speak of numbers, it's true; but in them the numbers are articulated with categories or concepts that give them a significance they otherwise don't know. Shoaf would seem to want to turn the relationship between numbers and more substantive con cepts around, with results that I believe are unintentionally comic (one imag ines Milton deliberating on whether to have his eldest read to him in Latin again this morning: "If I do it, will we both remain one, and thus three? or will I be making us into a false duality—just one?") Better, surely, that the theology go untranslated and unglossed than that it should be submitted to such ill-informed modern wisdom. Though I think Shoaf's project is seriously misguided, I would not be taken to imply that criticism informed by Lacan or Deleuze or Eco ought not to be directed at Milton. It is just that a cognizant Lacanian analysis, for example, should approach Milton in a rather different way, making an explanation of his poetry's ideology and form its object and end, instead of seeking to gloss it with Lacanian truths (equating Christ's sacrifice, say, with the repression imposed by the subject's entrance into the Symbolic). Neither would I leave this book behind without noting that it is strong in places. Shoaf's argument for Ovid as an influential reference point even for the later Milton provides an interesting sidelight, and his relation of individ ual Ovidian myths (Medea, Philomela) to Paradise Lost is insightful. Again, the last chapter, on Samson Agonistes, offers a remarkably acute reading of that tragedy's action, the category of the dual serving here—accidentally, but usefully—to underscore the play's ambivalent relation to classical tragedy, and thus to define its singularity as a form. And finally, to note a virtue that is not incidental but rather central to the book's purpose: while one may have doubts about the moral discourse Shoaf implicates his "lexicon" in, still he does demonstrate, I think, that many of these words (e.g., "partner," "im part," "impair") are complex words; or, more precisely, that though they are not exactly puns, they possess a punning dimension—they might be called semipuns. Shoaf's moralizing explanation of Milton's frequent use of the semipun, in his chapter on rhymes and puns, is clearly inadequate; but a more extensive documentation and bolder explanatory analysis of this char acteristic Miltonic figure might yield interesting results.
