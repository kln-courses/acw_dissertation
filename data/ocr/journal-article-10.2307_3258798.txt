<plain_text><page sequence="1">Painted Ladies of the Early Bronze Age ELIZABETH HENDRIX More than 4,000 years ago, during the Early Bronze Age, people inhabiting the islands of the Cyclades in the South Aegean Sea between present-day Greece and Turkey produced vessels and anthropomorphic figures from the white marble found in abundance in the mountains and along the coastlines (figs. I, 2). For many modern viewers the stark, unadorned surfaces of nearly all of these objects seem consistent with the minimal definition of their forms, leading to the supposition that their modern appearance closely resembled their original state. But is there evidence to support this notion? It is virtually impossible for us to comprehend the intent of the prehistoric carvers; the works provide the only clues. Although writing had already been invented in Mesopotamia and adopted in Egypt by the late fourth millennium B.c., it apparently had not spread to the Cyclades of the third millennium B.c. We can only hypothesize about the language of the ancient Cycladic islanders, how they perceived themselves, their world, and their cosmos, and the meaning or signifi- cance they attributed to the marble artifacts they left behind. What is certain, however, is that these objects were important to the Bronze Age people in and - Y , ' - Y ~~NAXOS ? ANT.PAROS ^ -i.E IR .dIPARO0*' MELOS . v .O k * ' * THERA .* I:~~~~~~~~~~ I.

Compiled and drawn by author around the Cyclades, as excavated examples come from contexts spanning more than six hundred years. Although marble is a relatively soft stone, it is harder than the copper tools used by the islanders, thus raising the question of how the figures and vessels were carved. The occurrence of large emery deposits on the island of Naxos has suggested to some that this abrasive material could have been used in creating the forms of the figures. Indeed, Elizabeth Oustinoff has shown that many of them were probably made by abrading marble beach pebbles, often already polished into oblong shapes by the gentle, persistent waves of the Aegean. Pat Getz-Gentle (formerly Getz-Preziosi), noted scholar of Early Cycladic figures and vessels, has shown that the proportions of many were often carefully planned with a compass, resulting in a remarkable consistency of form. Such studies are inspired by one of the most compelling features of these Bronze Age creations-namely, their subtle curves and handsome contours. It is interesting that there are only a handful of variations among the types of figures, ranging from highly schematic and "violin" shapes to relatively naturalistic forms to severe abstractions of the human figure. It would seem that the artisans were not merely attempting to reproduce what they saw in the natural world, but rather were interested in expressing the symbolic forms that held some significance I 5</page><page sequence="3">for them, such as the elongated, upward-tilting face. The main types, represented by examples with known provenance, are arranged in approximate chronological order in figure 3. The fact that the sculptural forms adhered to these few varieties testifies to the sense of cultural identity maintained by the islanders over the course of the third millennium, a time referred to as the Early Cycladic period in the Aegean islands. Early exploration of the islands by Western antiquarians and other travelers first brought the marble figures to the attention of collectors and scholars in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Already in 1837 George Finlay, a British historian tracking a lead to the tomb of Homer on Ios, purchased several "rude marble figurines" from locals on his tour of the island (quoted in Arnott; see bibliography). Before the turn of the century, excavations were under way by trained professionals in the very young discipline of archaeology. By the I970S a large number of Early Cycladic marble objects had found their way into private and public collections, their sudden and powerful appeal a reflection of the mod- ern world's new appreciation for the clean lines and supple, abstract, but still human forms exemplified by the works of such sculptors as Brancusi, Modigliani, and Moore (Moore owned three Cycladic figures). These associations make it dif- ficult to imagine the elegant white forms in other than their undecorated state, interrupted by patterns of color painted boldly across their surfaces. In fact many, if not most, Cycladic figures were decorated with one or more colors, in patterns that do not necessarily emphasize or enhance their sculptural forms. And just as the idea of bright colors applied to the sculptures and architecture of Archaic and Classical Greece was at first difficult to accept, so elaborate painting on the smooth forms of Early Cycladic sculpted marbles definitely changes the way one thinks about these objects and the people who created them. Over the last six years I have conducted a careful study of numerous Cycladic marble figures in the Museum and in collections in Great Britain, Europe, and Greece. This research has shown that red, blue, and perhaps black markings were applied to figures dated on the basis of stylistic development throughout the entire period of their production. Today, most scholars writing on the subject acknowl- edge that at least some of the figures were embellished with color, but this feature has generally been given little consideration with regard to the meaning of the objects. Rather, interpretations have focused on the fact that the majority are female, and the standard conclusion based on that observation is that they are either goddesses or concubines. Such a simple dichotomy is limiting and often counterproductive. Other scholars, such as Christos Doumas and Lucy Goodison, have observed that certain features of the marbles, including the presence of paint, may have had a symbolic significance that we cannot yet interpret, given the scarcity of evidence. My work in the Museum has been directed toward increasing the amount and quality of the evidence that can be found in the painted surface. The painted patterns offer an additional form of expression and can be examined as primary information. In the absence of archaeological context for most Cycladic figures, it is especially important to note and consider any information that the objects 6 1</page><page sequence="4">4.

Keeping in mind that the sculptures were the expres- sions of a people silent now for millennia, we might view these material remains as an opportunity to get acquainted with an ancient, remote, and fascinating society. Fourteen figures, five vessels, and the lid of a vessel constitute the Early Cycladic collection of marble objects in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. All were examined and, where necessary, repaired and/or cleaned in the Sherman Fairchild Center for Objects Conservation in preparation for their installation in the new galleries for Greek art in the Robert and Renee Belfer Court. Each "type" of Early Cycladic figure (see fig. 3) is represented in the Museum's collection, which therefore provides an overview of these works. None of the examples has a known provenance. Much of the examination process focused on the identification and docu- mentation of traces of ancient painting on the marble. Twelve of the fourteen fig- ures show evidence of paint, although some reveal these traces only under special lighting conditions. Eight of the figures and one of the vessels preserve particles of red and sometimes blue pigment. Several techniques were employed in the examination of each figure, as the sum of the results often provided more com- plete evidence for painting than any one of these methods could reveal. Five of the figures with indications of paint are discussed in detail below. They were chosen as the best examples of each type of evidence-from traces of pigment and differently weathered marble surfaces to those traces that are revealed by special techniques to be described below, such as computer enhancement and ultraviolet reflectography. 17</page><page sequence="5">6.

Reconstruction of color of fig. 6 In each case, making a careful sketch of the figure proved to be of singular benefit. The exercise of putting to paper a mark or tone corresponding to every square centime- ter of surface forces one to look at the surface much more carefully than when making a quick line drawing or setting the object up for a photograph. A small head in the collection (figs. 4, 5) provides the clearest evidence among the Museum's pieces that Early Cycladic figures were painted. The ancient pigment on this head is relatively well preserved. Traces of at least six vertical red stripes across the fore- (EDS) a c l head can be seen with the unaided eye. Red forehead stripes have also been noted on a Cycladic head in the Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Missouri, Columbia. Low-power magnification shows that the pigment of each of these stripes on the Museum's head remains in greater quantities at the edges than at the centers, suggesting that the stripes may have been outlined before being filled in. Red paint can also be found along the length of the nose and on the cheeks near the nose, perhaps the remnants of stripes beginning to extend horizontally across the cheeks. A small trace of red can be found in the neck incision just below the chin. In addition, blue pigment is visible with 3ox magnification and appears to be associated with the red, both on the forehead, in a stripe just above and slightly to the left of the nose, and on the right cheek at the end of the logical extension of the red hori- zontal cheek stripe. Particles on the upper part of the face, ranging from dark brown to black, correspond to facial features that can be easily discerned, including eyes with pupils and eyebrows, symmetrically arranged in relation to one another. The left eye is easier to see; the right eye is similar to the left, but appears smudged. In September 1993 the red pigment was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and clearly shown to be cinnabar, with mercury and sulfur as the only major elements. Thus far this mineral has not been found in the Cyclades; the closest sources known to me are in the Almaden region of Spain, in the Balkans near Belgrade, and on the coast of Turkey near Ephesus, a settlement founded, according to Greek tradition, in the tenth century B.c. The soil on the island of Naxos, one of the production centers for Early Cycladic sculpture, is rich in iron oxides and bright red in color. Yet the local red was not used for this head. Did the rarity of cinnabar enhance the value of the pigment, making it more suit- able for decorating the sculpture? 81</page><page sequence="6">8. Head from Figure of a Woman.

Reconstructions of color of fig. 8 Another figure in the collection (figs. 6,7) preserves enough pigment to con- vey at least some of the ancient painting. Considerable detail has been sculpted, including hair, eye sockets, and a penis as well as female breasts, suggesting that the figure is hermaphroditic. The Early Cycladic perceptions of gender may have been flexible (examples of "pregnant males" are known). The two breasts protrude from a square chest, the left breast smaller and higher than the right, contrasting with the otherwise symmetrical composition of the sculpture. Across the chest are traces of red pigment that create a series of vertical and diagonal stripes. Other figures of varying types preserve such traces, including one in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, where the pigment was also identified as cinnabar. The chart (fig. 3) also shows two examples with this design that date from the end of the Early Cycladic II period and were found on Amorgos and los. The presence of this par- ticular design on figures dating only to the latter part of the Early Cycladic II period may mean that it had special significance for a small community within the larger Early Cycladic culture. The example illustrated below (figs. 8, ga, b) actually preserves very little pig- ment, but shows clear traces of ancient painted design that result from differential weathering of the marble, known as "paint ghosts." The right eye and pupil and the lower line of the left eye were not originally raised above the plane of the face; paint protected the original surface from the erosion that slightly lowered the level of the rest of the face. Similar curving lines above the chin may represent a mouth. The once-painted features of the face, including the two wide eyes with tapered corners and pupils set at their centers, can best be seen in raking light. The right 9</page><page sequence="7">10.

Reconstruction of color of fig. 10 eye is better preserved than the left. When the head was examined under low (7x-3ox) magnification, red pigment was observed in the sharp angle separating the left side of the back of the head from the neck; there is no evidence of differen- tial weathering where this paint remains. It may be that the kind of paint deter- mines the effects of erosion on the stone during burial. Paint consists of a colorant, usually a pigment, suspended or dissolved in a medium. The ingredients can be varied to achieve the best effect for a given colorant. Thus a strong, dense pigment such as cinnabar can be applied to stone in a thin medium and still produce a strong color. Such paint may be thin enough for some of it to seep into the pores of the stone, in effect staining it. Azurite, how- ever (which has been cited as occurring on Cycladic objects), is a very transparent pigment, so that much of it is required before an intense blue results. For this pig- ment a bulky medium-such as wax or egg tempera built up in layers-is the best type of vehicle. The paint would then sit on top of the stone, acting as a barrier between the stone and the surrounding environment. The choice of medium may explain why red, which penetrates the stone, is the most commonly preserved pig- ment on Cycladic figures but is rarely associated directly with paint ghosts, and why paint ghosts rarely preserve traces of pigment. We might imagine, then, the 101</page><page sequence="8">eyes of this figure in blue, with a red line separating the head from the neck at the front and sides. Photographs of painted details on Cycladic figures can be computer-enhanced to heighten the contrast between areas of painted and unpainted stone. This tech- nique was used by Laurence Doyle, Jean Lorre, and Eric Doyle to transform a vague image of the famous Shroud of Turin into a picture of the cloth in which numerous details could be identified. Computer enhancement does not add infor- mation to the image, but seeks to separate the significant visual information found on the surface from the random discolorations that result from adventitious dirt and weathering. Computer enhancement of a photograph of an average-size figure in the col- lection (figs. Io, I I, I2) revealed much more detail about the painting than had been observed initially. Subsequent examination of it under low-power magnifica- tion confirmed the details revealed on the enhancement. Specifically, I was able to see on the marble surface both the pupil of the right eye and the line describing the eye. I was previously under the impression that the eye had been rendered as a solid almond shape. After studying the computer-enhanced photograph, I was able to recognize these features as areas on the stone that had a slightly different polish. I was then able to measure the width of the line around the eye and found that it was a consistent 0.2 cm all the way around. Even though the details of the eye were visible on the original photograph, I didn't see them until I noticed them on the computer enhancement. Additional details of painted designs include a paint ghost at the pubic area, indicated by a smoother triangular-shaped patch of marble, and actual traces of color, as shown in the color reconstruction. The largest figure in the Museum's collection (figs. 3, I4, I5) illustrates that additional evidence of paint on Cycladic figures can sometimes be obtained by ultraviolet-reflectance photography. UV-reflectance photography documents the way materials reflect light in the spectrum just outside the visible range. Many types of film are sensitive to this range, even when the human eye is not. The film can, in effect, render visible what otherwise is not. Vinzenz Brinkmann has demon- strated how once-painted marble could preserve the original design, even when no pigment remained. He applied techniques using ultraviolet light and photography to painted Greek sculptures from the Archaic period (ca.700-500 B.C.), achieving startling results, inspiring me to try to enhance the traces of paint on Cycladic fig- ures with this form of documentation. Red pigment was found in many places on the front and back when the figure was examined under low (7x-3ox) magnification, in incisions at the back of the left jaw, the back of the right knee, the top of the back leg groove, the top of the neck groove at the back, and on the top and the right line of the pubic triangle. There is also red paint on segments of flat surfaces that describe a variety of almond shapes when the stone is viewed in ultraviolet light. In the UV reflectographs (see fig. 14) the outlines of almond shapes, sometimes with dots in their centers or straight lines radiating from them, can be seen on the face, chest, and even on the back of the head. There are also short horizontal ellipses below the nose that appear darker and suggest the same kind of mouth as on the sculpture in figure io. One I II</page><page sequence="9">13. Female Figure.

Black-and-white ultra- violet reflectograph of fig. 13 15. Reconstruction of color of fig. 13 almond shape appears just to the left of the front leg groove, another appears on the back of the left side of the head, three appear on the right side of the face, and one on the left side. The color reconstruction (fig. 15) illustrates that the preserved traces of red pigment most often correspond either to incisions or to these dark shapes that become most apparent on the reflectographs. This evidence justifies the identification of some of the markings visible in the UV reflectograph as traces of ancient painting. The proportions of the large sculpture seem to have been carefully measured with a compass, a technique described by Getz-Preziosi in her book Sculptors of the Cyclades (see fig. 16). The arc of the head swings down to bisect the figure at the curve of the waist, the shoulder curve is completed by the opposite curve at the knees, and the curve of the toes is followed through in the implied curve described by the sides of the hips. In this way the sculpture is divided into four very nearly equal parts. Yet the small breasts are again positioned asymmetrically, so that the right one is higher than the left one. The neck incision meets in the back to form a 1 13</page><page sequence="11">16.

It is a greater challenge to accept similar evidence for asymmetrical designs or familiar shapes in the "wrong" locations (such as several eyelike almond shapes on one side of the face). It may well be that symmetrical patterns have been retained more often since they are easier to recognize, thus inspiring more care on the part of the handler, whether curator, dealer, owner, or restorer. If we hope to understand this culture better, we must keep an open mind toward its artifacts, and we must support efforts to conduct systematic excavations of Cycladic sites. Unprovenanced remains can only offer isolated clues regarding the people who made and first appreciated them. The bits of information they do carry, however, should be carefully examined rather than assumed. The present examination of the surface of Early Cycladic marble objects in the Museum provides several pieces of information about the Bronze Age Cycladic islanders. Some features of the painting seem significant to me and are outlined below. Future excavations may provide supporting or contradicting evidence for my hypotheses, which are offered as an initial step toward understanding the painted Cycladic figure. Bold painted designs draw attention to the surface of the sculptures, so that the surface may be seen as at least equal in importance to the sculpted form. The huge 141</page><page sequence="12">dark eyes, bright red stripes on the forehead and cheeks, and perhaps other markings on the small head illustrated in figure 4 are certainly as striking as the contours. The choice of cinnabar, at least on occasion, suggests that this pigment had some value beyond its color, since bright red iron oxides would have been readily available on many of the islands. If cinnabar was an imported material, its exotic origins may have added prestige to this color for the islanders. Cinnabar was identified on the small-to-average-size sculpture illustrated in figure 4. Its presence indicates that painting, or even painting with rare colors, was not reserved for large-scale sculptures. The question arises as to whether the islanders would have held the larger ones in greater esteem, since they may not have been impressed with "monumentality" as other cultures were or are. The asymmetry of much of the painting is consistent with the subtle asym- metries of sculptural form, as noticed most often in the placement and size of the breasts and in the slightly off-center incised lines (for example, the spine). This tells us much about the makers' sense of order; contrasting symmetrical and asym- metrical forms and details were part of the Early Cycladic consciousness. The almond shape seems to be a favored motif and may have had some special, even symbolic, significance. Its use for eyes on many of the sculptures may be a clue to this significance. It is startling to see eyes such as those on the sculp- ture in figure 13 in numbers and in locations that do not correspond to nature, yet it is a placement that has to be considered in the face of the evidence. Furthermore, multiple or overlapping colored shapes might indicate that some of the figures were painted on more than one occasion before being buried, perhaps as part of a periodic ceremony. It should also be noted that the act of painting may have been as important as the design itself and could explain, at least in part, the repetition of certain motifs. The different types of preservation of painting, even on one sculpture, such as that shown in figure 8, suggest that the artist had access to a technology that had developed a range of paints to take advantage of the different properties of the pigments. Moreover, the very thin, even outlining of an eye on the sculpture in figure io shows off the considerable skill and sense of refinement of the artist. My primary goal has been to increase the body of evidence by proposing that we take another look at the surface of Early Cycladic marble figures, a look that is in some cases impossible with the unaided eye. The various methods described above helped me see the surface of these beautiful marble figures and perhaps allowed a glimpse below it as well. I s5</page></plain_text>
