Concentrating on the obscur ing, or conflation, of the distinction between explanation and justification that lies at the heart of the ad hominem argument, this essay examines a number of famous passages in Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, and Dewey's Reconstruction in Philosophy in light of Marx's comments about the connection between ad hominem argument and philosophical radi calism. Jaspers's Critique of Heidegger: The Arrogance of Thought, RAY GOGEL The essay attempts to understand Karl Jaspers's assessment of the thought of Martin Heidegger by organizing Jaspers's notes on Heidegger into a cohesive critique with two related dimensions: 1) Jaspers's objec tions to Heidegger's understanding of the task of philosophy and 2) Jaspers's question of the goal of philosophical critique in general. Jaspers maintained that every thinker represents a specific "cipher" or "power of Being." The goal of philosophical critique is a "knightly com bat" in which these ciphers can manifest themselves and test each other. By participating in this essentially dialogical process we can attenuate the arrogance of our thought. Genuine communication can lead to the "foundering" of any philosophical "position" and open up the essential questionability of both thought and existence. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

Copyright ? 1987 by the Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">174 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Metaphysics of Claude Levi-Strauss ' Structuralism: Two Views, ROBERT ZIMMERMAN In the first section of this paper, the author attempts to make explicit and clarify the metaphysical assumptions and commitments which pro vide the basis of C. Levi-Strauss' structural anthropology. In the second section, he offers a critique, from the perspective of so-called analytic philosophy, of what is taken to be an unresolved and unresolvable tension in his metaphysic. The third section offers an exposition of J. Derrida's Heideggerean critique of the metaphysics of structuralism. The primary aim in exploring these divergent approaches is to shed as much light as possible on the metaphysics of structuralism. The second aim (a hope) is to use Levi-Strauss' thought as a paradigm in terms of which the hermen eutical possibilities of both approaches can be thrust into relief. The third aim (utopie) is to reach some philosophically substantive conclusions about the two traditions themselves. Schemata: Heidegger and Lewis, PATRICK L. BOURGEOIS The purpose of this paper is to delve into the fundamental level of Heidegger's ontology in Being and Time and Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics in order to render an adequate context for a radical critique which demands an expansion of his hermeneutical phenomenology in a direction which, on further investigation, makes apparent a particular point of affinity with the implicit but central role of schemata in the pragmatic philosophy of C. I. Lewis. Thus, the stages of development of this paper are predetermined by the very project itself: firstly, an in depth, evaluative re-construction of Heidegger's problematic on the radi cal level of Dasein's existential structure of comprehension, leading to a more specific focus on the schemata; secondly, this analysis leads to in sights for a critical evaluation of certain limitations, rooted in the most primordial and fundamental level of Dasein's structures and demands an expansion of the Dasein analysis; finally, in the context of this expansion, the general context will be then restricted to the one main theme of the schemata central to Lewis's pragmatic philosophy in a way parallel to its role in Heidegger's philosophy. Hudson on uToo Much"Evil, KEITH CHRZAN Hudson concludes that there is not more evil in our world than an omnicompetent deity could allow. He reasons that the argument from the quantity of evil (AQE) necessarily degenerates into the argument from any evil (AAE) and he provides a theodicy for (AAE). Unfortunately for Hudson, his attempt to reduce (AQE) to (AAE) is either trivial or falla cious, depending upon whether one interprets (AQE) deductively or proba bilistically. Moreover, Hudson's proposed reduction of (AQE) to (AAE) seriously jeopardizes his theodicy for (AAE): if Hudson is right about (AQE) then his theodicy for (AAE) amounts to the claim that necessarily erroneous human value judgements justify the evil in our world.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 175 Response to Chrzan, YEAGER HUDSON The Evolution of Philosophical Ideas in France, PIERRE-PHILIPPE DRUET Freedom as Reconciliation: The Essence of the Individual's Freedom in the Philosophy of Hegel, TADEUSZ GADACZ JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1987 The Epistemology of First Person Reference, CAROL ROVANE First person singular modes of thought and discourse display several distinctive features: the use of "I" is accompanied by referential guaran tees; "I" is irreducible to any co-referring terms; and de re attitudes play a motivational role that de dicto and de re attitudes about oneself do not play. These features could easily be explained on the hypothesis that users of "I" have a sort of immediate self-awareness in virtue of which they are able to refer to themselves directly, without appeal to identifying or individuating criteria. Anscombe observes that a Fregean conception of reference rules out such a hypothesis and concludes that "I" does not refer at all. The author accepts her premise but avoids her conclusion by showing that the features in question can be accounted for within a Fre gean framework. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 4, April 1987 Content by Courtesy, LYNNE RUDDER BAKER Recent attempts to make the concepts of belief, desire and intention scientifically respectable have focused on concepts of narrow content, which are to satisfy two constraints, one semantic and the other physical. After showing the inadequacy of Fodor's proposal to construe narrow content in terms denoting phenomenologically accessible properties, this paper argues (by means of a thought experiment) that no concept can satisfy both the constraints. A concept that satisfies the physical con straint fails to satisfy the semantic constraint, and hence is a concept of content only by courtesy. Functions, JOHN BIGELOW and ROBERT PARGETTER</page><page sequence="4">176 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 5, May 1987 Moral Realisms and Moral Dilemmas, WALTER SINNOTT-ARMSTRONG After defining moral dilemmas and distinguishing various degrees of moral realism, the author argues that extreme moral realism cannot ac comodate moral dilemmas. Realistic moral facts do not favor either al ternative in a moral dilemma, but different agents can still personally favor different alternatives, and then their personal rankings and choices determine what they morally ought to do. This refutes extreme moral realists who claim that moral judgments are independent of such personal mental factors. The author closes by responding to various objections and showing that his argument does not rule out more moderate versions of moral realism. Kantian Ethics and Supererogation, MARCIA BARON Kant's ethics is often faulted for giving "duty" too broad a scope and failing to recognize the category of supererogatory acts. Some scholars, notably Thomas Hill, Jr., have defended Kant by arguing that he can recognize that category. The author does not believe that Kant can, and tries to show why; but she also thinks that his theory is none the worse for it. This paper examines Kant's reasons for being wary of the distinction between what one must do and what is good to do but purely optional, as well as arguments in support of the position that the category of the supererogatory is of great importance to ethics. It is argued that all of the meaningful theoretical work which that category is thought to accom plish can be handled by the Kantian framework (in particular, by his distinction between perfect and imperfect duties, together with attention to the agent's character) and probably handled better. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 6, June 1987 Van Fraassen on Explanation, PHILIP KITCHER and WESLEY SALMON Bas van Fraassen has offered an account of the pragmatics of expla nation, and has claimed that the resolution of questions in the pragmatics of explanation provides a complete account of explanation. This paper argues that the latter claim is incorrect. Given van Fraassen's condi tions, it is possible for any true proposition to explain any other true</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 177 proposition. Moreover, to block the trivialization, van Fraassen would have to solve all the traditional problems in the theory of explanation. It is concluded that van Fraassen has provided a valuable account of the pragmatics of explanation but that a pragmatic theory of explanation is incomplete. Identity, Essence, and Indiscernability, STEPHEN YABLO JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 7, July 1987 Red and Right, ALAN GOLDMAN This article evaluates the claim that the analogy between moral prop erties and secondary qualities supports a realist interpretation of the former. It examines the extent to which disagreements in ascriptions of secondary qualities in normal conditions and disagreements in ascribing moral properties even in ideal conditions block realist interpretations. The problem is shown to be more severe in regard to Tightness than in regard to goodness. Relativizing away disagreement succeeds in the case of conflicting judgments regarding right or just distributions of goods only if the truth of such judgments is relativized to moral frameworks or sets of judgments. But then the claim of a moral theory that is relativist in this way to remain realist is problematic. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 25, No. 3, July 1987 Passion, State and Progress: Spinoza and Mandeville on the Nature of Human Association, DOUGLAS J. DEN UYL In general, this paper is devoted to comparing the writings of Bernard Mandeville (1670-1733) to those of Baruch Spinoza (1630-1677) in the area of social and political theory. Although Spinoza is well known to philoso phers in the areas of ethics and metaphysics, his social theory is less well appreciated. And despite the fact that Mandeville influenced such thinkers as David Hume and Adam Smith, his views are also not much discussed by philosophers. A comparison of the theories of these two thinkers should help illuminate the character of both their highly inter esting and controversial conceptions of man, society, and state. Detailed textual analysis of both thinkers is offered in three main areas: 1) man and his passions, 2) evolution and progress, and 3) the state.</page><page sequence="6">178 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Avicenna on Existence, ALLAN BACK In Islamic philosophy, in particular, with Ibn Sina (Avicenna), there appears, in quite explicit form, a view of predication at odds with many current interpretations of Aristotle and views of predication. That view is that the simple affirmative categorical proposition "S is P" is to be read as "S is (existent) as a P", and that for its truth it is required both that S be existent and that that S be P. This paper sketches out the development of that view. It then shows how this view resolves such vexing problems in interpreting Aristotle's logic and ontology as the existential import assumption and his view of first philosophy. F. H. Jacobi and the Development of German Idealism, DALE EVARTS SNOW Commentators on German Idealism from Hegel to the present have been fond of claiming that the philosophical movement between Kant and Hegel displayed a logic or necessary unfolding of thought to a degree seldom found in the history of philosophy. This paper contends that the rethinking of the scope and role of philosophy which occupied the energies of Kant's immediate successors is related only to a limited extent to the criticism of Kant, and cannot be fully understood without an appreciation of the catalytic role played by Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and the so-called pantheism controversy. The origins of the pantheism controversy and Jacobi's attacks on both Kant's and Spinoza's theories of intuition are discussed with respect to their possible influence on the concepts of intel lectual intuition of the early Fichte and Schelling. MilVs Conception of Happiness as an Inclusive End, ROBERT W. HOAG The paper challenges the simple hedonistic view of happiness tradi tionally attributed to John Stuart Mill. It argues that Mill conceives of happiness as a higher-order, inclusive end: happiness involves a diverse plurality of goods including, among other things, pleasures. This inter pretive approach is developed to explain Mill's traditionally puzzling re marks about parts or ingredients of happiness, his conception of the Art of Life, and a plausible connection between Mill's utilitarianism and the paramount value of liberty. It is then argued that this interpretive ap proach is compatible with Mill's views about the connection between de sires and pleasures and with remarks in Utilitarianism traditionally un derstood as indicating Mill's fundamental commitment to a simple hedon istic conception of happiness. Plato on Philosophic Character, RICHARD PATTERSON</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 179 THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 61, No. 2, Spring 1987 Freedom, Self-Interest, and the Common Good, RICHARD J. CONNELL The principal aim of this essay is to show that freedom must be defined in relation to the common good and that man's private good must be subordinated to and attained through the common good. As a result, freedom implies an obligation to justice. Such a notion of freedom stands in contrast to the view currently held by so many, that it is essentially the "right" to pursue one's self-interest without interference from one's neighbors or from civil authority. A primary consequence for welfare programs of the notion defended is that they ought to aim principally at making citizens capable of contributing to the common welfare. The procedure employed is empirical, and the first principles are attained from common experience. The author has eschewed a polemic against current philosophers for the reason that today philosophy is taken to be only a dialectic, and its roots?the origins of its principles?in "ob jective reality" are ignored. On that account this article attempts to ground its presentation in observation in the hope of rectifying, in con nection with this issue at least, a serious fault of contemporary phi losophy. A Problem of Unity in St. Thomas' Account of Human Action, GERARD CASEY This article considers the question of whether St. Thomas' theory of action and his theory of morality are mutually consistent. It claims that these theories are not mutually consistent, for they are connected in such a way that St. Thomas has to choose between preserving the ontological unity of human action at the cost of not being able to evaluate it morally, or, on the other hand, providing a viable ethical theory at the cost of compromising the ontological unity of moral action. The first section examines St. Thomas' account of lying. Two basic questions concerning the specificity and unicity of human action emerge from this examination: 1) what makes an act to be a specific moral act?, and 2) what makes a specific moral act to be one act? The second section attempts to show, by means of a textual examination, that St. Thomas does not appear to be able to provide an account of human action that will satisfactorily answer both these questions simultaneously. The Role of Axiotherapy in the Treatment of Modern Ailments, LAWRENCE B. DeSAULNIERS Although using a satirical, tongue-in-cheek approach, this article, nevertheless, makes a serious attempt to display and overcome the logical</page><page sequence="8">180 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS fallacies as well as the deeper cultural consequences that result from the radical split between fact and value so characteristic of much of modern reductionist thinking (for which see Henle's "Reflections on Current Re ductionism" The New Scholasticism [Spring, 1985]). The author takes the term, axiotherapy?which he had originated (as far as he knows) some time earlier?and uses it as a key to the pseudo-medical approach in the article. The logical fallacies are set forth as "dis-eases" and the various corrective measures are described as "treatments." The fallacies include reductionism itself as well as exclusive particularity, anthropomorphism, hypostatization or reification, and bifurcation. The advocated "treat ments" are highly generalized in the article, but an Aristotelian-Thomis tic complex is implicit in the entire regimen. Roger Bacon Bibliography (1957-1985), JEREMIAH M. G. HACKETT and THOMAS S. MALONEY Frege and the Aristotelian-Thomistic Tradition on Signification, ORESTS J. GONZALEZ NOUS Vol. 21, No. 1, March 1987 Hermeneutics and the Limits of Consciousness, RUDOLF A. MAKKREEL The overall thesis of the paper is that hermeneutics at the same time presupposes consciousness and limits it. A philosophy like Kant's, which stresses the limits of knowledge and claims that we cannot make sense of what is given directly without appealing to something available only indi rectly, is at least quasi-hermeneutical. Yet any theory of interpretation that endorses the hermeneutic circle demands more interdependence be tween form and content than Kant's philosophy permits. Hegel and Dilthey provide two ways of overcoming this form-content dichotomy. Hegel does so by transcending the standpoint of finite consciousness, Dilthey by reconceiving it. After also considering the contributions of Heidegger to hermeneutics, the author goes on to question Foucault's supposition that hermeneutics necessarily aims at a deep, fundamental meaning. Perfect Being Theology, THOMAS V. MORRIS</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 181 NOUS Vol. 21, No. 2, June 1987 What Is Abstraction?, STEPHEN POLLARD There is a growing consensus among philosophers that mathematics is best regarded as the science of abstract structure. Yet what it means for something to be mathematically abstract remains unclear. In partic ular, one would like to know what connection, if any, there is between the abstractors of an abstract structure and processes of mathematical ab str&amp;ction. The pioneering work of Weyl and Lorenzen on abstraction theory suggests that such a connection not only exists, but is of the great est importance. Although the Weyl-Lorenzen approach suffers from some unexpected difficulties, its general outlines can be preserved within a new and more adequate notion of abstraction (the basic idea being that "definitions by abstraction" are really inter-theoretic interpretations of a certain sort). Discontinuity and Identity, ANDREW BRENN AN Consciousness may be an episodic phenomenon. The general condi tions of identity for episodic objects are discussed, with a view to throwing light on identity conditions for minds. By considering both four-dimen sionalist and non-four-dimensionalist metaphysics, certain conditions on identity are isolated as of crucial importance: these concern matter, structure and cause, and they seem to apply successfully both to physical and to psychological cases. Of the three conditions, the one concerning structure is discussed at length, for it suggests a more illuminating treat ment of identity than one given in terms of sortal-covered continuity. A concept of survival like the one introduced in the early work of Parfit also plays an important part in the discussion, and it is emphasized that the proposals in the paper involve conceptual development rather than con ceptual analysis. The Geometry of Visual Space, ROBERT FRENCH This paper gives topologic and metric analyses of the geometric structure of phenomenal visual space. With respect to topology, it first argues that visual space is a bounded, continuous space, and then uses dimension theory to show that since regions of the space can be bounded by a one-dimensional space?a line?the space must be two-dimensional. With respect to the metric structure, evidence from wide-angle photogra phy is used to show that the global metric structure is spherical, and then to show that it possesses a local variable curvature to account for the size constancy tendency. Finally, the paper shows how this local variable curvature can serve as a phenomenal cue for depth and that it is enhanced in binocular vision.</page><page sequence="10">182 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Philosophy One and Two, ERMANNO BENCIVENGA There are two ways of doing philosophy: the philosophy of necessity and the philosophy of possibility. The former is a philosophy of coercion, which tends to reduce the number of alternatives to be considered in a rational approach to the world. The latter is a philosophy of liberation, which tends to extend the number of those alternatives. The philosopher of possibility proceeds by telling stories about how the world could be, and though he cannot prove the consistency of his stories in any definitive way, he can use them strategically to weaken his opponents. Miracles and Probabilities, GEORGE SCHLESINGER "If" Is Unambiguous, MICHAEL KREMER Statistical vs. Direct Evidence, FERDINAND SCHOEMAN Bergmannian Meditations, STEVEN LAYCOCK PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 37, No. 146, January 1987 Points of View, A. W. MOORE The concept of a point of view is pivotal to a wide variety of philosoph ical issues. In this essay, the author tries to probe it, along with such related concepts as that of a perspectival (and correlatively an absolute) representation. A perspectival representation is one which is from a point of view, an absolute representation, one which is from no point of view. The author relates his discussion to recent work by Thomas Nagel and Bernard Williams, and to the saying-showing distinction in Wittgen stein's Tractatus. The main focus of the essay is the question of whether absolute representations are possible. Acting under Duress, NORVIN RICHARDS To act under duress is to act under threat. Not every threat is equally impressive, however. Some exonerate the agent entirely, chang ing the agent from an object of criticism to one of sympathy, as when the cashier whose drawer is empty turns out to have given away the money at gunpoint. Others do not exonerate but do mitigate, as when the perjuring witness turns out to have been frightened by gangsters. Still other</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 183 threats neither exonerate nor mitigate. What ought to make these dif ferences? And, what are we to say about mixed motivation?occasions when the threat was only one of the person's reasons? These questions are connected, and call for a general account of duress. This paper re views two such accounts, then offers one in which the key is what it shows about the agent's character for him to yield to the particular threat in question. Sentences about Time, QUENTIN SMITH The subject of this essay is the issue of whether time consists merely of relations of earlier, later and simultaneity or whether it also consists of properties of futurity, presentness and pastness. The author argues for the latter position via a consideration of the semantic properties of tensed sentences. He argues that (1) such sentences ascribe properties of futur ity, presentness and pastness and (2) these sentences are sometimes true. In the course of his argument, he criticizes the token-reflexive theory of tensed sentences and the theory that these sentences refer to the date of their utterance. The Problem of the Past, DAVID COCKBURN Recent discussions of the kind of meaning possessed by our talk about the past are marked by a supposed contrast between the unproblematic present and problematic past tenses and by the idea that we can get clear about the kind of meaning which our talk about the past has prior to any consideration of the way in which the past can give us reason to do or feel certain things. The former idea, which is reflected in both "realist" and "anti-realist" approaches as well as in certain strong strands in contem porary ethics, inevitably leads to a distorted picture of our practical thought. Furthermore, the notion of "the present" to which it appeals cannot be made intelligible. The latter idea is a reflection of a picture of the relation between the theory of meaning and the rest of philosophy, in particular ethics, which must be rejected. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 96, No. 2, April 1987 Discovering the Forms of Intuition, PATRICIA KITCHER This paper tries to provide some additional insight into Kant's ideal ism by considering his theory that space is the form of outer sense in terms of eighteenth century concerns about spatial perception. In particular, it argues that Kant was familiar with Descartes', Berkeley's, and Leibniz's theories of spatial perception, and that it was reasonable for him to view</page><page sequence="12">184 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS his own theory as a considerable improvement on those of his predeces sors. It also argues that Kant's work on spatial perception fits into his general program for doing transcendental psychology: he analyzes partic ular knowledge tasks to determine what mental functions they involve; he then shows that given that we are able to perform some uncontroversial tasks, it follows that we are able to carry out those mental functions requisite for particular kinds of knowledge. Compossibility, Harmony, and Perfection in Leibniz, GREGORY BROWN This paper attempts to develop a coherent and textually justifiable way of constructing Leibnizian complete individual concepts and Leibniz ian possible worlds. Armed with these constructions, it endeavors to produce a plausible account of what Leibniz meant by "compossibility," one that will avoid the objections that have been raised against the logical interpretation of compossibility. Finally, it attempts to reconcile two, apparently conflicting, accounts of harmony that can be found in various of Leibniz's works?namely, the account in terms of simplicity of laws and variety of phenomena, on the one hand, and the account in terms of quan tity of essence, on the other. PHILOSOPHY Vol. 62, No. 241, July 1987 A Science of Mars or of Venus?, MARY TILES The aim of this paper is to create a space for considering the legiti macy of various recent radical critiques of science, i.e., critiques (whether feminist, marxist, or third world) which demand that the project of the natural sciences be reconsidered. Such critiques rest on a rejection of values which are claimed to lie at the heart of modern science. This means that they need not be taken seriously if standard defences of the value-free nature of science are allowed to stand. It is argued that they cannot stand because (a) the notion of empirical success, on which claims to objectivity in theory choice are made to rest, is underspecified and further specification reveals the role of values in determining what is to count as empirical success; (b) it can be shown, by reference to the transi tion from pre-modern to modern science, that values have played a role in shaping both the content and the empirical base of modern science. Causation in History, MENDEL F. COHEN This paper shows that the "descriptivist" analysis of Hart's and Honor?'s Causation in the Law is not true of contentious causal claims in</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 185 history and daily life. It argues that such claims presuppose or entail moral and other valuative beliefs but that their valuative dimension is systematically repressed. This gives rise to irreconcilable disputes about causes and mistaken historicist views of historical knowledge. It is sug gested that while there are good reasons for historians to eschew valuative causal interpretations, their doing so would require a massive revision of the expectations which historians and their readers bring to historical inquiries. What Is the 'Problem of Induction'?, E. J. LOWE The author argues that it is unhelpful to conceive of inductive rea soning as a formal mode of inference with specifiable canons or rules, and especially unhelpful to look for an inductive counterpart to the deductive relation of entailment. He also argues that the view that there is a "problem" about induction which may have only a sceptical solution is to a considerable extent rooted in a misconception concerning the semantics of statements of natural law, in particular the assumption that such state ments are primarily to be thought of as universal statements concerning individuals. When laws are more appropriately construed as statements about sorts or kinds, many of the traditional sceptical worries concerning our ability to confirm laws empirically or to predict future events with their aid may be seen to be misplaced. Rorty and the New Hermeneutics, FRANK G. VERGES Richard Rorty's central positions are defended. A thoroughgoing materialism sans mirroring enables Rorty to avoid metaphysical ideal ism. The causal independence of nature from thought is consistent with holding that the intelligibility conferred upon nature is entirely a human affair. Forms of metaphysical and scientific realism are rejected insofar as they embody the incoherent demand to know the world as it really is independently of human modes of representing it. The project of physi calism may be construed as the coherent possibility of predicting every event in every space-time region under some description or other. But if physicalism or materialism is construed as anything more than this, e.g., as an encompassing discourse which would include all true statements, it is obviously false, since the initial choice of descriptive vocabularies is always optional. Rorty's "end-of-philosophy" trope, however, is rhetori cal overkill, especially since it does not cohere with the contention that the term "philosophy" does not name a natural kind. Freud and Sexual Ethics, DAVID CARR In so far as Freudian and psychoanalytic theory might be held to have a bearing on problems of sexual ethics, they are likely to be regarded as essentially subversive of a traditional or conventional view of sexual mo</page><page sequence="14">186 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS rality. For, since an individual cannot be blamed for what he cannot help the alleged discovery of unconscious causes of so-called abnormal or de viant sexual preferences may appear to make the pursuit of them a matter to which morality is essentially irrelevant. Following a brief survey of Freud's writings on psycho-sexual development and the identification of a number of genuine conceptual difficulties in his account, it is argued that his view of sexual life and conduct is one which presupposes certain defi nite moral values of a quite traditional and conventional nature. The Flight from Blame, MARY MIDGLEY PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 47, No. 3, March 1987 Need Miracles Be Extraordinary?, ROBERT HAMBOURGER This paper is a defense of belief in miracles. Critics in the tradition of Hume argue that by definition miracles are too extraordinary for testi mony to establish. However, if there is even a remote chance that God exists, it simply will not be that surprising if miracles sometimes occur, and so not extraordinary if certain miracle reports are true. Against this Humeans give a simple inductive argument: miracles involve violations of regularities that have been observed as often as any, and so, by induction, it would be extraordinary if they failed in fresh cases. The author argues, however, that this argument is fallacious. In addition he argues that miracles need not always violate laws of nature and that Humean argu ments assume, unreasonably, that religious explanations of known events can never be preferable to naturalistic ones. Detecting Temporalities, GILBERT PLUMER This paper argues that ^-determinations (past, present, future) and ^-relations (simultaneous with, earlier (later) than) are in the same class, in that they are all neither historically discoverable nor sensible, but are detectable, and are detectable in the same way. This, then, constitutes a reason for thinking they are in the same class with respect to objectivity, contrary to the Russellian view that "in a world in which there was no experience there would be no past, present, or future, but there might well be earlier and later." The argument is developed to furnish an explana tion of how, in fact (and contra McTaggart), we are "immediately certain of the reality of time," the explanation being that we detect time. Concepts and Correspondence, SCOTT A. SHALKOWSKI</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 187 The World Never Lost: The Hermeneutics of Trust, ROBERT J. DOSTAL Goods and Evils, J. L. GARCIA Questions: An Essay in Descriptive Phenomenology, KARL SCHUMANN and BARRY SMITH PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 47, No. 4, June 1987 The Persuasiveness of Zeno's Paradoxes, JOHN R. McKIE It has been argued that we find Zeno's paradoxes of motion persua sive because physical time is dense and continuous, while time as we experience it is discrete. But we do not experience time as a succession of distinct, countable, consecutively ordered mental "nows." Nor is it com mon to attempt the futile mental task of traversing in thought the infinite number of spatial subintervals in Zeno's paradoxes, as has also been sug gested. Rather, we find the paradoxes persuasive because there are a number of different conceptual and linguistic problems inherent in them. For instance, understanding how it is possible for Achilles to come to the end of an endless sequence of spatial intervals requires us to distinguish different senses of the word "end." Economy of Expression and Aesthetic Pleasure, ERMANNO BENCIVENGA Many critics find economical works of art to be aesthetically more valuable, but they do not say why. An explanation is proposed here in three steps. First, it is pointed out that the spectator or reader gets involved in constructive activities, analogous to those originally per formed by the author. Second, it is noticed that such activities are gener ally useful for people's preservation and welfare. Third, a combined Freud-Lorenz model is used to explain why generally useful activities should give pleasure: pleasure is the phenomenological counterpart of the discharge of drive energy, which accompanies (not the consummation of an object, but) the performing of some moves. The Causal Indicator Analysis of Knowledge, STEVEN LUPER-FOY This paper describes and motivates an approach to knowledge that is called the Causal Indicator Analysis. The strategy is to sketch the main</page><page sequence="16">188 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS features of an adequate account of knowledge, then use that sketch to reveal some of the faults of some leading analyses defended today. The author is particularly interested in discussing the work of Fred Dretske, whose views have significantly influenced his own. These tasks accom plished, the author offers his own account and argues that it has the features an account of knowledge should have. Stated concisely, the view is that we know that a given belief is true just in case it is not irrational and our being correct about it is not simply a lucky accident. Global Anti-Realism, JAMES O. YOUNG Dummett has been concerned with showing how one might give an anti-realist account of restricted classes of sentences. This paper argues that it is possible to give an anti-realist account of all classes of sen tences. That is, in the case of no classes of sentences does truth transcend what can be warranted. The key to global anti-realism is replacing Dummett's empiricism with a coherentist account of warrant. The au thor points out that Colin McGinn's argument against global anti realism fails. Nietzsche's Theory of Truth and Belief, ROBERT NOLA The first part of this paper outlines Nietzsche's theory about the nature of the world?the world is a matrix of disembodied forces and powers. In the second part a case is made for Nietzsche's commitment to a version of the correspondence theory of truth in deciding between broad metaphysical theories: his own, and rivals such as mechanistic atomism or any substance-based or material-based theory. In the third part Nietzsche's claim that our material or substance-based ordinary modes of talk are illusory is outlined but not critically examined. Nietzsche's prag matic theory of belief and truth with respect to our ordinary beliefs is sketched and allocated a role that still leaves room for the correspondence theory of truth to account for the alleged illusory character of these be liefs. In the final section one argument for the claim that these ordinary modes of talk are illusory is explored. It turns out that Nietzsche's grounds for his claim reveal some unresolved difficulties for his position. Aristotle on Friendship and the Shared Life, NANCY SHERMAN PHRONESIS Vol. 31, No. 3 Between Knowledge and Belief, NEIL COOPER The paper's aim is to clarify the status of "the things-between" and of belief in Republic 5. The law of noncontradiction and the criterion for</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 189 individuating capacities are crucial in this. Predicative, ontological and alethic interpretations are argued to be logically linked. Plato's purpose is (a) to contrast, in an anti-Heraclitean spirit, invariant truths-objects with unstable truths-objects, and (b) to characterize in a dismissive way objects, for which beliefs about them vary in truth-value not only with time but also in other respects, and which are thus subject to epistemolo gical handicaps. His distinction between the uniform-and-invariant and the unstable is a distinction between grades, not degrees, of existence. The Theory of the Opposites and an Ordered Universe: Physics and Metaphysics in Anaximander, M. GAD FREUDENTHAL According to a received view, Anaximander held that the opposites, after emerging from the apeiron, hold each other in check, thus producing an immanent natural order. Drawing on medical ideas of health to eluci date the notion of equilibrium within the theory of the opposites, the paper argues that Anaximander did not have this concept of a dynamic equilib rium of the opposites, which rather depends on the apeiron. (Static equi librium, however, physically accounts for the stability of the earth.) Bringing medical notions again to bear on Anaximander, it is shown that the idea of an equilibrium of the opposites is not in conflict with the view that the world will ultimately be reabsorbed into the apeiron.
