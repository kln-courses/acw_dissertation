<plain_text><page sequence="1">DOROTHY H. FICKLE THE BODHISATTVA WITH A MASK T he Tibeto-Chinese collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art contains a small bronze seated bodhisattva who holds a horned lion mask before his chest (fig. I).x The presence of this mask has initiated this investigation into the identity of this bodhisattva and the meaning of the mask. The bodhisattva sits upon a lotus pedestal with his legs crossed at the ankles and his body slightly flexed at the hips, waist, and neck. His hair is piled high in a double knot topped with a jewel. His five-leaf crown, his jewelry, his lower garment, and his posture and dimensions are all reminiscent of Nepalese art, whereas his facial features, the ribbons attached to his crown, and the long scarf draped over his arms are Chinese characteristics. He wears the full complement of ornaments typical of Buddhist bodhisattvas: earrings, a short and a long necklace, armlets, bracelets, anklets. Long streamers fall from his waistband over his ankles and thence over the pedestal. All the body parts of this bodhisattva have been painted with cold gold, while the jewelry, dress, and pedestal are unpainted. The only attribute possessed by this bodhisattva is the horned lion mask. This image bears an inscription at the top of the lotus pedestal (fig. 2) which reads: Da Qing Qianlong nian jing zao, "respectfully produced [in the] Qianlong period [of the] Great Qing," the standard seven-character mark of the Manchu emperor, Qianlong (reigned 1735-96). Stylistically the image relates to the hundreds that were discovered in 1926 by Stael-Holstein in the Baoxiang Lou in the Forbidden City, published by Clark in Two Lamaistic Pantheons.2 The images in that temple probably originated among the thousands that Qianlong is known to have given to his mother on her sixtieth, seventieth, and eightieth birthdays in 1751, 1761, and 1771.3 Innumerable additional images were produced under this emperor's patronage to serve the Lamaistic temples throughout his empire. Many of these images have found their way into sculptural collections around the world. Another inscription on the base of the image (fig. 2) gives the name of the bodhisattva, gang guang tongzi, "the youth with a shining net." But why does "the youth with a shining net" hold a mask instead of a net? What is the meaning of the mask? How did the idea of a net enter his iconography? These questions can be easily answered, primarily based on previous scholarship. There is another, more far-ranging question, however, which will be the main focus of this paper. Who is this bodhisattva, and what is his function in Buddhist iconography? How has the problem about the meaning of his name affected his interpretation in manadalas throughout the Buddhist world? The Name The Sanskrit name for this bodhisattva is Jaliniprabhakumara, which, as in the Chinese version above, is generally translated as "the youth (kumdra) with a shining (prabha) net (jdlinf)." Actually, 347 Accession no. 74-36/44.

Jaliniprabhakumara is a sun bodhisattva. The jdlinf element of his name is a synonym of the sun. The earliest Sanskrit spelling for the name of this bodhisattva was Jvaliniprabhakumara.4Jvdli(nz) means "flame" or "bright light". Combined with prabha, "shining" or "bright", its meaning was intensified. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit tended to simplify the consonant clusters encountered so frequently in Classical Sanskrit, such as the jv at the beginning of this word.Jvdlinf became simply jdlinf. To the first users of this altered expression, the intention surely remained the same. Jaliniprabha still meant a "bright flame" or a "bright light", and the term was still a synonym for the sun. Gradually, however, the word came to mean something quite different. The metamorphosed form, jdlinf, had an alternate meaning, "net". Either internally in the Sanskrit-using Buddhist world, or as the original Sanskrit name for this bodhisattva began to be translated into other languages, the meaning of his name became transformed into "the youth with a shining net". We have already seen that the Chinese name for this bodhisattva is translated in this way. The Tibetan Jaliniprabhakumara is gZhon nu dra ba can gyi 'od. In practice, in both Sanskrit and Tibetan, the word meaning "youth" (kumdara or gzhon nu) is often omitted, shortening the name to Jaliniprabha or Dra ba can gyi 'od. This name is included on the list of bodhisattvas in the Mahdvyutpatti (henceforth called MVY), a Sanskrit-Tibetan glossary of religious terms begun in the late eighth century and finished during the reign of the Tibetan king, Ral-pa-can, who ruled 815-36, designed to foster consistency in the translation of Buddhist terms from Sanskrit into Tibetan.5 Alexander Csoma de K6ris, in his English translation of MVY, rendered the name Jaliniprabha as "illusory or ensnaring light". He was apparently translating gyi 'od (Skr. prabha) as "light" and dra ba (Skr. jdlinf) as "illusory or ensnaring", words which bear the connotation of "net". Based upon MVY, Edgerton, in his Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, translated the jalini or dra ba element of this deity's name as "net", or dra ba can as "having a net".6 An occasional image of this bodhisattva does hold a sun, the proper attribute for Jaliniprabha. More frequently, he holds a net, the result of the faulty translations of his name. The mask is unusual. I know of only two examples where this bodhisattva holds such a symbol. One of these is the Nelson- Atkins image. The other, also produced in North China during the Qianlong period, is reproduced in Clark.7 We shall see below that the mask, like the sun, is a proper attribute for Jaliniprabha. 4 The orthographical problems connected with the name of this bodhisattva are discussed in Franklin Edgerton, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, (reprint ed., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1972), 15, no. 2.8; Anjali Mukhopadhyaya, "Traditional Lore Regarding Mafijuiri," The Adyar Library Bulletin (n.s.

Napier in Masks, Transformation, and Paradox pointed out the link between the sun, fire, and the lion mask.8 A typical passage reads: "Agni,9 born of wood and consumer of wood, is said to make the forest black with a lick of the tongue. Conversely, as a beneficent force, Agni is the rising sun and the source of enlightenment. This complex solar imagery of devastation and enlightenment - of an ambivalent deity who is a destroyer but also a source of inspiration - underlies the notion of the third eye.'o This same imagery also assures the close connection between the solar fire of Agni and the facial features of the lion since, from Rome to India, the lion's wide-open mouth mythically accounts for the scorching heat of the sun."" This same view was expressed earlier by Chevalier and Gheerbrant in Dictionnaire des symboles, who wrote that "le masque, notamment sous ses aspects irreels et animaux, est le Face divine et plus specialement le face du soleil, que traverse le rayonnement de la lumiere spirituelle."'2 Again, "leface de Gloire'3 est la face du soleil, par ohi s'effectue la sortie du cosmos."'4 Yet again, "puissant, souverain, symbole solaire et lumineux 't l'extreme, le lion roi des animaux est charge des qualites et defauts inherents a son rang.'I Earlier scholars have also pointed out a link between the lion mask and the sun. Combaz in 1945 noted that in the classical mythology of the Eastern Mediterranean world, "les rapports entre le lion et le soleil ne sont pas douteux."'6 Cammann in 1940 wrote that the Indians often referred to the lion mask as Suiryamukha, the Sun Face.I7 Coomaraswamy, the great interpreter of Indian symbolism, wrote in 1927 that the kfrttimukha, the terrible Face of God, represents both the Sun and Death, generating and devouring his children.I8 The form of the mask has varied from place to place and time to time. The earliest examples in India appeared during the Gupta period (fourth to fifth century A.D.).'9 The Indian kirttimukha, "face of glory," originally depicted as a monster, gradually came to resemble the face of a lion. Usually the mask had round, protruding eyes, set closely together, surmounted by arched eyebrows, which originally extended into two horns, below which were the two ears. The horns usually rose upward. Flying locks of hair were displayed, and the teeth, flanked by curving tusks, were prominent in the open mouth. Gradually the lower jaw was eliminated. Sometimes from under the tusks emerged festoons of pearls or garlands which linked a number of kirttimukha together. These festoons gradually evolved into stems connecting a central mask over a doorway with other monsters called makara at either end of the arch. Sometimes there were arms and hands accompanying the face.20 This type of Indian mask travelled to Tibet, where it appeared as the zirdong, a lion face without a lower jaw, dripping festoons, pendants, snakes, or an ornamental band from its mouth. This type has 349 8 A. David Napier, Masks, Transformation, and Paradox (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1986). 9 The Indian god of fire.

This type often has arms and hands which grasp snakes or bands which issue from the corners of its mouth, and is frequently combined with two deer, two dragons, or two mnakara.22 The mask held by the Nelson-Atkins bodhisattva represents a third type, described by John Clarke as Sino- Mongolian. The jaw is squarer than on examples from Tibet, and it is distinguished "by its distinctive handle-bar shaped horns which curl downwards and outwards."23 The mask held by the image in the Baoxiang Lou pantheon also has the handle-bar horns and the flat upper jaw similar to the Nelson-Atkins example.24 Why did these two images originating in North China in the eighteenth century employ a symbol suggesting the original meaning of this bodhisattva whereas elsewhere his role in the pan- theon appears to have been forgotten? Are these two images which hold a mask, a symbol of the sun, connected with the few which hold the sun directly? In this paper I shall examine all the examples of Jaliniprabha(kumara) known to me to determine how the faulty translation of his name has affected his iconography and to isolate the instances where the artists included the correct attribute. The Iconography ofJdliniprabha The major work on the iconography of the bodhisattva Jaliniprabha has been undertaken by Marie-Th"rise de Mallmann. In Etude iconographique sur MaijuSri,25 she described the two different roles assumed by this bodhisattva, as an attendant to Mafijusri, or as a member of a particular group of sixteen bodhisattvas. She treated him again in her Introduction c l'iconographie du tadntrisnme bouddhique. 6 De Mallmann's sources were the Nispannayogdvalf (hereafter called NSP),27 a text of the late eleventh or early twelfth century by Abhayakaragupta, which outlines twenty-six major mandalas of Tantric Buddhism, the Sddhandmald (SM),28 an iconographical compendium of the seventh to ninth century, and the Kriyasamgraha (KS) by Kuladatta, date unknown.29 Benoytosh Bhattacharyya also described this bodhisattva in the introduction to his edition of NSP and in The Indian Buddhist Iconography.30 Snodgrass has described this bodhisattva as revealed in Japanese ma- terials.3I In my study of Jaliniprabha, I shall go beyond these earlier scholars by consulting a greater number of manaalas than they were able to do.

I have located this bodhisattva in nineteen different man.dalas. For each example, I shall identify and examine the text which underlies the mandala, and compare the textual description of Jaliniprabha with a published example of the mandala. First I shall examine Jaliniprabha in his role as an attendant to Mafijuiri and then as one of the Sixteen Bodhisattvas. I shall also note his location in each mandala and with whom he is associated, devoting particular attention to Candraprabha, the moon bodhisattva, who frequently forms a pair with this sun bodhisattva. This examination will demonstrate how this bodhisattva has actually been perceived in Buddhist art and literature, and to what extent the altering of his name has affected his iconography. GROUP ONE: JALINIPRABHA AS AN ATTENDANT OF MANJUSRI Mandala no. I: The Japanese Mahdkarund Garbhadhdtu (Taizlkai) Mandala Of the seven mandalas which feature Jaliniprabha as an attendant of Mafijuiri, the most widely known throughout the world of Buddhism is the Japanese Mahdkarund Garbhadhdtu Mandala. This mandala is also called the Matrix Mandala, the Mandala of the Womb World, or the Taizokai Mandara.32 It is usually combined with another mandala, the Vajradhdtu, which will be discussed in Group Two below. The Japanese Garbhadhdtu and Vajradhdtu Mandalas are together known as the Mandalas of the Two Worlds, or the Rydkai Mandara, the two most highly prized mandalas of the Shingon sect. The basic text for the Garbhadhdtu Mandala is the Mahdvairocanasutra (henceforth called MVS), originally composed in Sanskrit in India between A.D. 500 and 650 by an unknown author.33 The Sanskrit text is no longer extant. An abbreviated version of the MVS was translated into Chinese by Subhakarasimha and Yixing in A.D. 725.34 This version was taken to Japan by Kobo Daishi (A.D. 774-835) in the ninth century. In Japan the text is known as the Dainichikyo (DNK). In addition to the text (MVS or DNK), the Japanese Garbhadhdtu Mandala is based upon commentaries by two eighth-century Indian scholars, Subhabkarasimha and Amoghavajra.35 The present orthodox form of the Garbhadhdtu Mandala, the Genzu Taizukai Mandara, has resulted from a long process of evolution within Japan, beginning with the copy made in China in A.D. 805 and taken to Japan by Kobo Daishi in 806.36 This original version is now lost.37 The first 35I 32 Mandara is the Japanese word for mandala. 3 BTI 26:26; A.K.

The only surviving copy that can be linked to Kobo Daishi's lifetime is the Takao Mandara, painted in 824 with gold lines on purple cloth. It is not clear whether this Takao version was based on the Chinese original, the 821 copy, another copy, or a black-and-white sketchbook based on one of the earlier versions.39 An A.D. 191 copy of the Chinese original, recognized as the second official copy, now a fragment, is the oldest surviving full-color version.40 Two more official copies were made in 1296 and I693.4' The placement of the deities in the Takao and the 1191 versions is identical, suggesting that the latter is in the direct line of transmission from the original version. There are a few differences in the iconography of the individual figures.42 The most widely known of the Genzu Mandalas is popularly called the Shingon-in Mandala. This one, which has been beautifully published by Heibonsha,43 is outside the official line of transmission. The Shingon-in was the name of a Buddhist chapel in the precincts of the imperial palace at Kyoto. A set of the Mandalas of the Two Worlds kept in that chapel for use in certain rituals was destroyed in a fire in II77. For four years, 1178-81, the set from the Sai-in (Western Monastery) at the Toji in Nara was borrowed to use during these official rituals. This pair became known as the Shingon-in Mandalas, whereas in reality they should be called the Sai-in Mandalas, named for the temple where they traditionally belong.44 This full-color set is linked with the early Heian style and probably dates to the late ninth to the early tenth century. In Japanese Jaliniprabha is called Moko Doshi, translated by Snodgrass as "boy with the net of lights,"45 or Komyo Bosatsu, "the bodhisattva with the net of lights."46 Mammitzsch translated his name variously as "Shining-net Bodhisattva," "light net youth" or "light net hook."47 The central figure of the Garbhadhdtu Mandala is Vairocana or Mahavairocana, seated in medi- tation. Within a central square, called a "quarter" or a "mansion," Vairocana is accompanied by four Tatha-gatas and four bodhisattvas. Surrounding this is a band that contains three concentric rows of deities, who are grouped into seven more quarters. Outside this is a third band with four more quarters, and outside the entire group is a fourth band containing two hundred and two additional deities. Mafijuiri's quarter is located in the third band of the nmadala at the top (East), with Mafiju.ri himself seated in the center, surrounded immediately by four bodhisattvas. Jaliniprabha is seated at the proper right of Mafijuiri's group, accompanied by four other bodhisattvas. Jaliniprabha is the nearest to Mafijugri. His companions are Ratnaktita, Vimalaprabha, Candraprabha, and Mafijughosa. The first two of these companions are mentioned in MVS, although not in connection with Mafijuiri's mandala. Candraprabha and Mafijughosa are not mentioned in the text at all.48 The text says that Jaliniprabha "holds many precious nets."49 However, Subhakarasimha's commentary says: 352 38 Ibid., 176. 39 Ibid., 175. 40 Ibid., 174-75. 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid. 43 Yasuhiro Ishimoto, The Manydalas of the Two Worlds, 4 vols.

On the Shingon-in Mandala, his image is too badly damaged to reveal the attribute, although we can see his two hands placed before his chest. On the Takao Mandala, his two hands are again brought before his chest. He holds a noose in his right hand and a lotus in his left,52 the iconography according to Subhakarasimha's commentary. As for Candraprabha, he sits third to the viewer's left ofJaliniprabha. He carries a blue lotus that supports a crescent moon.53 Mandala no. 2: The Tibetan Abhisambodhi Vairocana Mandala This second mandala, the Abhisambodhi Vairocana Mandala of Tibet, is based on the same text as the Japanese Garbhadhdtu Mandala. In Tibet the text is called the Vairocandbhisambodhitantra.54 This was translated into Tibetan by Silendrabodhi and dPal-brtsegs during the reign of King Ral pa can (ca. 815-36).55 The Tibetan version of the mandala was based on an interpretation of the text by Amoghavajra (active A.D. 742-74), with some variations.56 An example of the Tibetan Ahhisambodhi Vairocana Mandala is no. 20 in the set of manydalas from the Ngor Monastery published by Kodansha in I984. 57The same mandala is also illustrated as no. 20 in volume thirteen of A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon (NTMP).58 The central figure is a seated, meditating Vairocana, known by the Tibetans as the Abhisambodhi-Vairocana. He is surrounded by three concentric square houses. Mafijusri,59 corresponding to the text, sits in the center of the top outermost layer, which is East, and Jaliniprabha sits at his right. In Ngor, Jaliniprabha is flanked by two smaller bodhisattvas, identified as Kumara Vimalaprabha and Kumara Ratnakitta.60 In NTMP there are likewise three bodhisattvas in a group to the right of Mafijuiri although they are not individually identified. Presumably the middle one is Jaliniprabha.

As mentioned above, Jaliniprabha is the only bodhisattva in this group prescribed by the text as an attendant for Mafijusri.6' Vimalaprabha and Ratnakuita are mentioned elsewhere in the text but not in connection with the quarter of Mafijuiri in this mandala. The other two found in the Japanese version, Candraprabha and Mafijughosa, are not mentioned at all.62 We have already observed that the text (MVS) stipulates "many precious nets" as the attribute for Jaliniprabha.63 In the Japanese version, he was actually holding a noose and a lotus. In Ngor, his attribute is difficult to see, but it could be either a banner or a jewelled net at his right shoulder. In NTMP, none of the three bodhisattvas attending Mafijuiri holds an attribute. The image of Jaliniprabhakumara published by Clark that holds a mask before his chest was located in the fifth side-chapel of the Baoxiang Lou, in a group which Lokesh Chandra has identified as illustrating the Vairocandhisambodhitantra.64 It is a mystery why this image, as well as the image at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, holds a symbol of the sun instead of the "many precious nets stipulated by the text. Perhaps the eighteenth-century artisans of North China who created these images had access to a translation of MVS or an iconographic compendium which retained the original meaning for this bodhisattva's name. We shall return to this question later. Mandala no. 3: Arapacana Maiijughosa Mandala Another text which mentions Jaliniprabha is the Mad~ju(rijjdnasattvasya-paramdrthanandma- sanmgiti, usually shortened to Man-jurindamasaimgiti (MNS), "chanting the names of Mafijusri."65 Like MVS, this text originated in the sixth-seventh centuries. It was translated into Tibetan in the eleventh century by Rin-chen-bzan-po, assisted by Kamalagupta. The text was later revised by Son Blo-gros brtan-pa.66 This text underlay seven mandalas altogether. Two of these mandalas include Jaliniprabha as an attendant to Mafijusri. These will be discussed here. In the next section of this paper I shall examine three additional MNS mandalas that treat Jaliniprabha as a member of a group of sixteen bodhisattvas. The other two MNS mandalas will be ignored because they do not include the bodhisattva Jaliniprabha. One of the two mandalas based on the MNS is the Five-Deity "Arapacana" Madijughosa Mandala.67 Because the text itself is extremely vague, one must rely upon the Sddhanamdld (SM)68 for informa- 6, MVS, 24; Snodgrass, 168-69, 379, and fig. 38. 62 Snodgrass, 379. 63 MVS, 24. 64 Clark, no. 5 B 14; Lokesh Chandra, Buddhist Iconography of Tibet, 3 vols.

There is another East Asian version of the Arapacana Mand1ala which does not include Jaliniprabha. See Christine Guth Kanda, "Kaikei's Statues of Mafiju'ri and Four Attendants in the Abe no Monjuin," Archives of Asian Art 32 (1979):8-26. 68 The date of the earliest known manuscript of the Sddhanamdla is 1163 (Bhattacharyya, 2). 354</page><page sequence="9">tion about the individual deities in this mandala. There are five deities: a central Mafijusri sur- rounded by four attendants, Kesini, Upakesini, Jaliniprabha, and Candraprabha. Jaliniprabha sits in the East, in front of Mafijusri, and Candraprabha sits in the West, behind the Master. The other two attendants are at the central deity's right and left. The five each represent one syllable of the name A- ra-pa-ca-na. Jalin-prabha or his equivalent, in connection with the Arapacana Mandala, is found in sddhanas 55, 56, 58, and 65. In SM 55 and 56, his name is Jaliniprabha. In SM 58, he is called Jalinikumara. In SM 65, his name is Sutryaprabha, "the light of the sun," another indication of the true meaning of our deity. In all of these sddhanas, the four attendant deities hold the same attributes as the central Mafijusri, a sword and a book. Examples of this mandala include Ngor 21I and NTMP 13:21.69 In Ngor, the name of our sun bodhisattva is gZhon nu dra ba can gyi 'od, the longer version of his name, equivalent to Jalini- prabhakumara, the "youth with the shining net." In both Ngor and NTMP, both Jaliniprabha and Candraprabha hold a sword and a book, the attributes stipulated by the sddhanas. Mandala no. 4: The Thirteen-Deity Vddirdj Maijujrf Mandala The second mandala based upon MNS is the Thirteen-Deity Vddirdj Man-jusri Mandala.70 This mandala is the subject of eight sddhanas in SM, but in only one, number 46, is the sun bodhisattva included. The central figure is Mafijusri as Vadiraj, with one face and two hands. He is flanked by Sudhanakumara at his right, Yamari at his left, Stiryaprabha, the name used here for Jaliniprabha, behind him in the North, and Candraprabha in front in the South.7' Additional Buddhas and goddesses form another circle around this interior group. Neither Suiryaprabha nor Candraprabha is described in this text, and I have found no example. Mandala no. 5: The Mandala of the Red MafjuSri The Mandala of the Red Manjusri, described in SM 57,72 also includes Jaliniprabha as an attendant to Mafiju"ri. Ja-liniprabha sits to the East of Mafiju*ri and Candraprabha to the West. Both perform the varadamudrd, or charity gesture, and carry apadma. I have not located an example of this mandala. Mandala no. 6: The Eight-Syllable Man-jusri with Thirty-Seven Deities Yet another mandala which includes Jaliniprabha as an attendant to Mafijusri is the Mandala of the Eight-Syllable ManjuSrf with Thirty-Seven Deities, derived from a text called the Delineated Rites of the Secret Eight-Syllable Formula and Madiala Practices of the Great Holy Ma t jurir Bodhisattva,3 which has been studied by Raoul Birnbaum. This ritual text was composed or translated into Chinese in 824 by Bodhirsi, who resided in Chang'an. According to Birnbaum, specific information about the (9 For sculptural renditions of this mana.dala, see Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art (New York: Dover Publications, 1965), fig. 358, and Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, Iconography of Buddhist and Brahmanical Sculptures in the Dacca Museum (Dacca: Rai S.

De Mallmann 1975, 194 corrected the translation, reversing these positions. The Sanskrit text of SM 46 reads daksinottarapdrSve candraprabhasuryaprabhau (de Mallmann 1964, 188), which assigns Candraprabha to the South and Stiryaprabha to the North. 72 De Mallmann 1964, 195 (Sanskrit) and 30-31 (French). The original source for the sddhana is not known. 73 T XX:II84, a text found only in Japanese collections and not in Chinese or Korean catalogues.

An example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is reproduced by Birnbaum.74 Again Mafijusri, with one head and two arms, sits in the center, and is surrounded by eight youths, with Jaliniprabha in the North, at the top of the mandala. The latter's name is translated by Birnbaum as "Radiant Net." According to the text, Jaliniprabha should sit on a lion and hold a banner.75 In the Metro- politan painting, he does sit on a lion, but his attribute is unclear. Candraprabha is not present in this mandala. Mandala no. 7: The Forty-nine-Deity Vajrabhairava Mandala The Forty-nine-Deity Vajrabhairava Mandala, based on the Srivajramahdbhairavandmatantra,76 presents the final example ofJaliniprabha as an attendant to Mafijuiri. This mandala is illustrated by Ngor no. 57 and by NTMP 14:57. The mandala is centered upon a nine-faced Vajrabhairava, an emanation of Mafijusri, who is surrounded by four male and four female vajra bodhisattvas. Around this inner group is a square house containing forty deities. In Ngor, Jaliniprabha is one of these. He is the last figure, excluding the corner deity, in the southern row, which is at the bottom. His name is spelled Dra ba can gyi 'od, Jaliniprabha. Candraprabha is in the East. Except for the central Vajra- bhairava, all the other forty-eight deities are ferocious like the Hindu god Yama, standing in dlidhdsana, with their right legs bent and left legs stretched out to the side. They all have buffalo faces, two arms, two legs, and hold a knife and a skull-cup. In NTMP, the individual deities are not identified. To summarize the iconography ofJaliniprabha as an attendant to Mafijusri, he is associated with a net in M VS, the textual source of both the Japanese Garbhadhdtu Mandala and the Tibetan Abhisambodhi Vairocana Mandala, whereas he actually holds a noose and a lotus in a Japanese example and a symbol of the sun in a Tibeto-Chinese example. For the Arapacana Mafjughosa Mandala and the Vddirdj Ma-jukri Mandala, both based on MNS, we must rely for iconographical information on sddhanas from the Sddhanamdld. The sddhanas stipulate that this bodhisattva in the Arapacana Mairjughosa Mandala should hold a sword and a book, which he does in the known examples. Suiryaprabha, the equivalent ofJaliniprabha in the Vddirdj Ma-jufri Mandala, is not described in the text, and I have located no example. For the Red Mai-jusri Mandala and the Eight-Syllable MainjuKri Mandala, the stipulated attributes are a padma and a banner respectively. In the Forty-nine-Deity Vajrabhairava Mandala, Jaliniprabha is like the god Yama, in buffalo form, holding a knife and a skull-cup. In other words, in only the first two of these seven mandalas is there any relationship to his name. The text for the Garbhadhdtu Mandalas did specify a net, the attribute derived from the faulty translation of this bodhisattva's name, but in practise he holds something else. In Japan he holds a noose and a lotus. In two Tibeto-Chinese versions he holds a mask, a symbol of the sun, derived from the correct translation of his name. In addition to the mask, we have encountered a few other clues that support the idea that Jaliniprabha is a sun bodhisattva. One is the frequent pairing of Jaliniprabha with the moon bodhisattva, Candraprabha. Another is the name Suryaprabha given to him by SM 65 for the Arapacana Mandala and by SM 46 for the Vddirdj Mandala. 356 74 Museum no. 1975.268.18.

One is the group of Vajra-bodhisattvas, each of whom has the word vajra preceding or suffixed to his individual name. These are associated four by four with the four regional Jinas or Tathagatas who surround the central Vairocana in the Vajradhdtu and other mandalas.77 The Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa, who usually reside in one of the outer circles or squares of a mandala, constitute a second group. Jaliniprabha and Candraprabha are members of this latter group. The Bhadrakalpa is the name of the present eon (kalpa), as opposed to the past and the future. Each of these three kalpas is believed to have one thousand Buddhas. Vairocana is the leader of the present, the Bhadrakalpa, so mandalas which are centered on him often contain the Thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa.78 The first reference to the Thousand Buddhas occurred in the Brahmajdla-suZtra, which was translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva in A.D. 4o6. It says: "I am called Vairocana and live in the ocean of the lotus world.... I incarnate myself into one thousand Buddhas."79 The Thousand Buddhas are all described and named in the Bhadrakalpika-sutra.80 Sometimes a set of sixteen bodhisattvas has been substituted for the Thousand Buddhas. Such a substitution is not mentioned in the basic text for the important Vajradhdtu Mandalas which I shall examine next.8' The idea of the Sixteen Bhadrakalpa Bodhisattvas seems to have originated in the commentaries, perhaps, as some claim, with Anandagarbha, who wrote such a commentary in the eleventh century.82 However, certain Japanese mandalas painted in the ninth century already include the group of Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa, as we shall see below. Furthermore, the ninth- century Tibetan dictionary, the Mahdvyutpatti, includes a definition of the Bhadrakalpika bod- hisattvas, suggesting that the concept was already known at that time.83 Among the mandalas that contain either the Thousand Buddhas or the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa, the most important throughout the world of Buddhism is the Vajradhdtu ("Diamond World') Mandala. The best known example is the Genzu Kongjkai Mandara ofJapan, the second basic Shingon mandala, which is paired with the Genzu Taizjkai Mandara that has already been discussed. The Vajradhdtu Mandala has been important in many countries throughout Asia. Its earliest repre- sentation may be the sculptural arrangement at Chandi Sewu in Java,84 which dates to the eighth century. The Borobudur in Java, dating to about 825, may also represent a Vajradhdtu Mandala.85 77 See de Mallmann 1975, 396-400. 78 K.W.

The basic text for the Vajradhdtu Mandalas is the Sarvatathdgatatattvasamngrahasitra (STTS), "the assembly of truth of all the Buddhas."87 In Japan this text is called the VajradekharasZitra (VSS) or Kongach--ky-, "Diamond Peak Sixtra."88 Recently Lokesh Chandra has clarified some confusion resulting from the Japanese title, explaining that in the school of Vajrasekhara-yoga, there are eighteen assemblies or systems. The STTS (and the Japanese VSS) is concerned with only the first of these eighteen assemblies, whereas the term Vajralekhara really applies to the entire group. Each of the eighteen assemblies, including the STTS, is in turn divided into four chapters, each of which focusses on a different deity: Vajradhatu, Trailokyavijaya, Sakala-jagad-vinaya, and Sarvarthasiddhi. Each chapter describes six types of mandalas, resulting in twenty-four for each assembly (six mandalas times four chapters). Thus the STTS should have twenty-four mandalas. The Genzu Vajradhdtu Mandala, the first Vajradhdtu Mandala that we shall examine, consists of nine separate man.dalas. The first six represent the six mandalas of the first chapter of STTS, all dedicated to Vairocana as Vajra- dhatu. The seventh is a variation of the sixth. Mandalas eight and nine are the first two in the second chapter of STTS, focussed on Trailokyavijaya.89 STTS was probably composed in the late seventh or early eighth century in the Andhra region of South India by either Nagabodhi or Santarakshita.90 A ninth-to-tenth century Sanskrit manuscript of this text was located in Nepal in 1956. This is the manuscript edited by Isshi Yamada. Vajrabodhi translated the recitation portions of the text into Chinese in A.D. 723,9~ and in 753 Amoghavajra translated the first chapter of the first assembly.92 This is the translation most frequently used by the Japanese. Amoghavajra also wrote a short summary of all the eighteen assemblies, which the Japanese call the JJhachi eshiki, "Synopsis of the Eighteen Assemblies."93 In 1015, the entire first assembly was translated by Danapala.94 who also translated the fifteenth. The sixth was translated by Dharmabhadra at about the same time. All of the other assemblies are now lost, but it is believed that many esoteric Buddhist suztras may once have been part of the eighteen-assembly VajradekharasiZtra. Danapala's translation of assembly one was sent to Japan in 1073 by Jojin, but it never became a part of the Sino-Japanese tradition.95 Danapala's translation more closely resembles the Sanskrit version found in Nepal and the Tibetan version.96 These seem to 86 Shashibala, Comparative Iconography of the Vajradhdtu-Maandala and the Tattva-Samgraha (New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1989), 12. 87 Isshi Yamada, ed.

STTS was translated into Tibetan by Sraddhakaravarma and Rin-chen-bzan-po in the early eleventh century.97 Commentaries on the text by Sakyamitra and Anandagarbha, also translated into Tibetan in the eleventh century, are useful in interpreting the Tibetan Vajradhdtu Mandala.98 Likewise, it is necessary to rely on Japanese commentaries to understand the details of the Japanese mandalas. Several versions of the Vajradhdtu Mandala have been painted in Japan. Here we shall discuss only the Genzu Vajradhdtu Mandala, also called the Nine Assemblies Vajradhdtu Mandala, the version used by the Shingon sect. In ritual practice, this mandala is combined with the Genzu Matrix or Garbhadhdtu Mandala, which was discussed in the previous section. The two form a pair known as the Ryjkai Mandara. Like the Garbhadhdtu Mandala, the VajradhdtuZ Mandala is based on materials brought back from China by K6bo Daishi in A.D. 806. The most authentic copies still extant in Japan are the partners for the Garbhadhdtu Mandalas discussed above, the Takao, painted in gold and silver on a dark ground, copied in 824 from originals brought back by K6bo Daishi,99 and the Shingon-in or Sai-in from T6ji, copied in color in the late ninth to early tenth century.'0 The Shingon- in is the most widely known because of its frequent and high-quality publication. Also important is the Kojima Mandala, painted ca. Iooo in silver line on a purple cloth.'o' The Shingon-in and the Kojima Mandalas are not true examples of the official Genzu Mandala, as their line of transmission from K6bo Daishi is not direct. The Kojima Mandala includes a few variations in the number and positions of the deities.'02 The Japanese Genzu Vajradhdtu Mandala is often called the Nine Assemblies Mandala because it is made up of nine sub-mandalas, which are based on the first two chapters of the first assembly of STTS. In the central mandala, called the Vajradhatu-mahdmandala, the central figure is Maha- vairocana, with one head and two hands, performing the bodhyagrTmudrd.'03 He is surrounded in an inner circle by a basic set of thirty-six deities; an additional twenty-four deities are in an outer circle. Surrounding them all are the Thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa. In sub-mandalas 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9, the Thousand Buddhas have been replaced by the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa. In the band containing the Sixteen Bodhisattvas, there are a total of twenty-four figures alto- gether. In the four corners are Offering Bodhisattvas, and in the cardinal directions are Bodhisattvas of Attraction who serve as gatekeepers. The Bhadrakalpa Bodhisattvas sit two by two between these eight directional deities. Thus on each side there are a corner deity, two Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, a central deity, two more Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, and a final corner deity. In all five of these sub- mandalas, Jaliniprabha appears on the top side (West) as the third figure from the right, immediately 97 TOH 479; Shashibala, Io. 98 Lim, 331. 99 Published in Chandra, Esoteric Iconography. o00 Published in Ishimoto, The MAandalas of the Two Worlds, and in Seibu, Eros + Cosmos. 101 I saw the Kojima Mandala in the Nara Museum in May i99i. 102 Mammitzsch, I75. 103 According to Marie-Ther~se de Mallmann, "Notes d'iconographie tintrique, V. A Propos de quelques mudra," part I, Arts Asiatiques 32 (1976), 178, bodhyagri is the preferred spelling of this mudrd. She cites Tucci, Indo-Tibetica IV, vol. I, io8. This word is spelled as bodhyangi in G6sta Liebert, Iconographic Dictionary of the Indian Religions (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1976), 45, and in Bhattacharyya, Iconography, 53-54. Certain texts used in this study, such as NSP and SM, use the bodhyangi spelling of this word. The meaning is the "quintessence of enlightenment (bodhi)" (de Mallmann, "Notes," 178). It is often called a "wisdom fist." A fist is made by the left hand, while the five fingers of the right hand clasp the left index finger. 359</page><page sequence="14">to the viewer's right of the western Bodhisattva of Attraction, who sits in the center. Candraprabha sits at Ja-liniprabha's proper left, next to the corner Offering Bodhisattva. The names of the Sixteen Bhadrakalpa Bodhisattvas are not identical in all texts and mandalas. De Mallmann 1975 has identified three different lists of the Sixteen Bodhisattvas, each associated with specific texts.'04 Among the lists there are differences in names as well as locations, although many of the names appear on two or three of the lists. Her first list (Appendix A) is associated with the STTS plus two other texts which we shall examine below, the Sarvadurgatipariodhana Tantra (SDP) and the Krfyasamngraha (KS). Her other two lists (Appendices B and C) appear in other mandalas which we shall also examine. To de Mallmann's lists I have added the Tibetan spellings of each name, and to her list one, I have also added the Japanese spellings. The names on the Japanese Shingon-in Vajra- dhdtu Mandala correspond to de Mallmann's list one, although with some minor spelling changes and some major position changes.'05 On de Mallmann's list one, Jaliniprabha is the last of the group of four in the West, which would place him next to the corner deity on the right end of the top row of the mandala. On the Genzu Mandalas, however, he is the third of the group of four, having moved one place to the left, just: to the right of the western gate keeper, who sits in the center of the West. Candraprabha has likewise moved from just left of that gate keeper, his position as specified in de Mallmann's list one, to the position at Jaliniprabha's left, making him the last bodhisattva in the West. These position vari- ations are consistent for all the sub-mandalas of the Genzu Vajradhdtu Mandala in which the sixteen bodhisattvas appear. Some commentators on the text say that all four of the bodhisattvas in each of the four directions should be represented with the symbol of the Tathagata of that direction, which means that the bodhisattvas of the West, including Jaliniprabha, should be represented by lotuses, the symbol of Amitabha.'o6 However, in the Takao, Shingon-in, and Kojima Mandalas, each bodhisattva has been given his own emblem. For Jaliniprabha, this is a jewelled net surrounded by flames. For Candra- prabha the emblem is a crescent or circular moon. In assemblies 2 and 9 of the mandalas, these bodhisattvas are represented by the symbol only. In assemblies 3, 4, and 8, they are in human form holding their symbols (figs. 4, a and b). Mandala no. 9: The Tibetan Vajradhdtu Mandala The Tibetan Vajradhatu Mandala is based on the first chapter of STTS plus the Tattvalokakari, a commentary on STTS by Anandagarbha (978-1o30).10 7 This mandala is similar to the central Mahdmandala of the Genzu Vajradhdtu Manddala, with some variations.r8 Ngor 22, entitled the ), o37- 104 De Mallmann 1975, 175. See Appendices A-C. The Man-jusirimuzlakalpa (MMK), an eighth-century text, presents two additional lists of the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa. See Ariane Macdonald, Le Mandala du Man-jufrim;7lakalpa (Paris: Adrien Maisonneuve, 1962), lo8-9; David Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors (London: Serindia Publications, 1987), 193; and Giuseppe Tucci, Gyantse and Its Monasteries (New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1989), 149, n. I. These two lists do not include J-liniprabha, although Candraprabha is on both of them. 105 In the South, the Genzu mandaala lists Sauraya instead of Surafigama, and the order of the bodhisattvas is rearranged in both the West and the North. In the West, Amitaprabha is first, followed by Bhadrapala, Jaliniprabha, and Candraprabha, whereas on de Mallmann's list one, the order is Amitaprabha, Candraprabha, Bhadrapala, and Jaliniprabha. In the North the order on the Genzu Mandalas is Aksayamati, Pratibhanakutta, Vajragarbha, and Samantabhadra, whereas on de Mallmann's list one, the order is Vajragarbha, Aksayamati, Pratibhanakita, and Samantabhadra.

The same mandala is also published in NTMP 13:22, and as a drawing in Chandra, A Ninth-Century Scroll of the Vajradhdtu Maandala.I09 This version of the mandala contains the full group of a Thousand Buddhas rather than the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa. Therefore Jaliniprabha is not present. Another Tibetan variation of the Vajradhatu Mandala does include Jaliniprabha, the Fifty-three- Deity Vajradhdtu Mayndala. This maydala is identical in all respects to the I, o37-Deity Vajradhatu Mandala except that the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa have been substituted for the Thousand Buddhas. In addition to its textual basis in STTS and in Anandagarbha's commentary, the same mandala is described as number nineteen in the iconographic compendium, the Nispannayogd- vall (NSP)."II An example of this manadala, based on NSP, is published in NTMP 12:19. With minor changes, the same mandala is the second of the series based on the ManjuIri-ndma sangiti (MNS), a text we encountered in Part One above."' The Sixteen Bodhisattvas of this Tibetan version are arranged according to de Mallmann's list one (Appendix A), without the variations in position we encountered in the Japanese Genzu Vajradhdtu Mandala. That means that Jaliniprabha sits at the end of the row in the West, just to the left of the corner deity, and Candraprabha sits to the left of the western gatekeeper in the center of the row. According to NSP 19, the attributes for each bodhisattva should correspond to the iconography of the Tathagata who rules over his quarter,"2 as some commentators of the basic text, STTS, have also maintained. The attribute for those bodhisattvas who sit in the West should therefore be a lotus surmounted by a vajra, as prescribed in this text for the Tathagata of the West, Amitabha. In the illustration from NTMP, Jaliniprabha appears to be in dhydnamudrd, but no attribute is discernible. Candraprabha has his right hand before his chest and his left on his hip, contrary to the NSP instruction. Again no attribute is discernible. In the pantheon from the Baoxiang Lou, an image of Jaliniprabha sits with his hands on his lap holding a lotus."3 Although the vajra that should be on the lotus is missing, this image probably illustrates this Tibetan version of the Vajradhdtu Mandala."4 In the same Baoxiang Lou pantheon an image of Candraprabha sits with his hands on his lap holding a lotus, which properly supports a vajra.II5 Maydaala no. 10: The Thirty-seven-Principal-Deity Sarvavid Vairocana Ma'ndala Other mandalas centering upon Vairocana are based upon the Sarvadurgati-parilodhanatantra (SDP), "Elimination of all Evil Destinies", written at least as early as the eighth century, the date of its first Tibetan translation."6 This text outlines thirteen mandalas altogether, all of which can be 109 P. 27. 110 NSP, Io-II, 44-47; de Mallmann 1964:222-23; 96-98; de Mallmann 1975:57-58, 124-27. Part 12 of NTMP illustrates twenty-four of these twenty-six mandalas. "' MNS 2, 29-30, 68-73. 112 NSP, 46. "3 Clark, no. A 4 B I. "14 This image was located in the fourth side-chapel of the Baoxiang Lou, where, according to Lokesh Chandra (Buddhist Iconography I:I8), the images represent the Sarvavid Vairocana Mandala, which will be discussed below. The main image in that chapel does represent Sarvavid Vairocana, with four faces, and two hands in dhydnamudrd. However, the names of the various deities and the iconography of the Sixteen Bhadrakalpa Bodhisattvas conform more closely with the Vajradhdtu Mandaalas. "1 Clark, no. A 4 B 6o "6 Tadeusz Skorupski, ed., Sarvadurgatiparilodhana Tantra: Elimination of all Evil Destinies (SDP) (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983). This edition contains both the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts and an English translation. There were two Sanskrit versions of the text, version A, translated into Tibetan by Santigarbha and Lo tsa ba Jayaraksita in the eighth century, revised by Rin chen mchog 365</page><page sequence="20">found in the Ngor collection."7 Only four of these contain the group of Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa."8 These four will be presented below. The basic mandala connected with SDP is the Thirty-seven-Principal-Deity Sarvavid Vairocana Mandala."9 At the center is the white Sarvavid Vairocana with four faces, his hands performing dhydnamudrd. He is surrounded by four bodhisattvas in the cardinal directions and four goddesses in the intermediate directions. Outside these are the sixteen Vajrasattvas, who correspond to the Sixteen Vajra-bodhisattvas. Eight offering goddesses are in the four corners, two in each corner, and four guardians are in the gateways. Along with the central figure, this constitutes the basic group of thirty-seven mentioned in the title of the mandala. The Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa are outside the Vajrasattvas, four on each side, flanking the gates two by two, as in the Vajradhdtu Mandalas. Additional deities optionally occupy the outer regions. Again the names of the Sixteen Bodhisattvas correspond to de Mallmann's list one (Appendix A). They appear, however, in a completely different order.'2x Thus Jatliniprabha, who is usually located in the West, is found in the South, and Candraprabha is in the East. Elsewhere, however, in the SDP text,'2' in a discussion of the same mandala by Tucci,'22 and in the key to this mandala in Ngor 27, the list of bodhisattvas corresponds exactly to de Mallmann's list one, placing Candraprabha to the left of the gate in the West and Jaliniprabha at the end of the row in the West, just to the left of the corner. This placement is identical to the positions of these two bodhisattvas in the Tibetan version of the Vajradhdtu Mandala we examined immediately above. Jaliniprabha is not described in this text. This Thirty-seven-Deity Sarvavid Vairocana Maadala has been published as Ngor 27, as NTMP 13:27, in Snellgrove and Skorupski as plate XVII, from the Lhakhang Soma at Alchi, and in Pal, A Buddhist Paradise, no. LS24, also from the Lhakhang Soma, Alchi.'23 In all of these examples, all of the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa are identical except for color. Each has his right hand raised before his chest, probably performing the teaching gesture, and his left hand is on his hip. No attributes are discernible. 366 in the ninth century, and now lost (TOH V:II6), and version B, translated into Tibetan by Chos-rje-dpal in the thirteenth century (TOH V:II7). Skorupski used Version B for his Sanskrit edition, but with frequent notes from commentaries on Version A. His edition includes the Tibetan texts for both versions. S7 Ngor 27-39. 18 Ngor 27, 28, 31, 39. "9 TOH 483; GDK, VI, ff. 134-200, 202-36. This maadala was outlined in the missing Sanskrit Version A. Therefore it appears in the Skorupski edition in a long footnote based on a commentary by Vajravarman (SDP, 311-13). This source lists 149 deities who make up the mandala. The same list can also be found in Chandra's preface in Tucci, Temples of Western Tibet, I:xxxi-ii. The mandala is also discussed in David Snellgrove and Tadeusz Skorupski, The Cultural Heritage of Ladakh (Boulder: Prajna Press, 1977), vol. I, 34-38, and in Giuseppe Tucci, Gyantse and its Monasteries, 3 vols. orig. Indo-Tibetica IV. 1-3 (1941), trans. Uma Marina Vesci, ed., Lokesh Chandra, gata-Pitaka Series, Indo-Asian Literatures, vols. 351-353 (New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, 1989), I:250o-65. The description in Snellgrove and Skorupski accounts for the varying number of deities represented in different illustrations of this mandala. Ngor 27, in spite of its title, actually has 209 deities. The basic group of thirty-seven deities always remains the same except for some minor name changes. 120 East: Suramgama, Samantabhadra, Candraprabha, Bhadrapala; South: Jaliniprabha, Gaganagafija, Vajragarbha, Amrtaprabha; West: Sarva'okatamonirghatanamati, Jfianaketu, Aksayamati, Pratibhanak-ta; North: Maitreya, Sarvapayajaha, Gandhahasti, Amoghadar'in.

It is illustrated as Ngor 39, NTMP 12:22, and NTMP 13:39. The central figure is S`kyasiirha, a name for S`kyamuni, golden in color, performing the dharmacakramudrd. He is surrounded by eight usnZsa deities, eight offering goddesses and four door guardians. In the outer gallery, flanking the gateways, are the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa, who are thus included in the basic thirty-seven deities, replacing the Vajrasattvas of the previous mandaala. There is a long version of this mandaala that adds many other deities in the outer regions. The Sixteen Bodhisattvas correspond to those of de Mallmann's list one, again placing Candraprabha to the left of the western gateway, and Jaliniprabha at the end of the row in the West. In SDP Jaliniprabha is described as follows: "The fourth Bodhisattva (on the west) is known as Jaliniprabha. He is beautiful and red. He holds the vajra-net."'I26NSP 22 says that "he holds a vajra cage, while his left hand is placed on his hip."'27 The Sanskrit term which has been translated as "vajra-net" or "vajra-cage" is vajrapanjaram. De Mallmann believed that this term may have ori- ginally been vajrajdla, an adamantine flame, but because I and r were often confused in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit manuscripts, vajrajdla became transposed into vajrajdra.12 8 Eventually the word became vajrapaijara, translated by Skorupski in SDP as "vajra-net" and by Bhattacharyya in NSP as "vajra-cage". De Mallmann illustrated an example of a vajra-cage used as a symbol for Jaliniprabha from a Nepalese manuscript.'29 It resembles a hanging bird cage. In the same Nepalese manuscript, Candraprabha was illustrated with a crescent moon. Vajrapanjaram thus appears to be another word derived from the wrongfully-translated jvdli, which has resulted in great confusion in the iconography ofJaliniprabha. In Ngor 39 and in NTMP I3:39, Jaliniprabha raises his right hand out to his side, with his left hand on his lap. No attributes are visible. In NTMP 12:22, which supposedly is an illustration of the mandala as described in NSP, his right hand holds up a sun, while his left is on his hip (fig. 5), although the text of NSP prescribed a vajra-cage (vajrapaiijaram). The artist who drew the illustration in NTMP 12:22 perhaps had access to a different manuscript of the NSP from the one available to Bhattacharyya for his edition of NSP or to de Mallmann. In Ngor 39 and NTMP 13:49 Candraprabha likewise has no attribute, but in NTMP 12:22, he holds a crescent moon. Mandala no. 12: Cakravarti Guna Mandala A third SDP manddala containing the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas is the Cakravarti Guna'30 or Cakravartin Mayaala.'3' Examples include Ngor 31 and NTMP I3:31. The Ngor example consists of nine concentric circles. A central white Vajrasattva is surrounded by the four regional Tathagatas: Vajrapani, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi. In the second circle are eight more 124 Ngor's terminology. 125 NSP terminology. This mandala is based on SDP, chapter I, 26-31; TOH 485; GDK VI, ff. 321-429; NSP zz, Sanskrit edition, 66- 71, summarized in de Mallmann 1975, 62-64. 126 SDP, 30.

In the fourth circle are the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, again arranged in the order of de Mallmann's list one. Other deities fill the remaining five circles. The Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas are not described in the text for this mandala. In Ngor, Jaliniprabha sits at the right end of the western segment of the fourth circle. He holds his right hand before his chest and his left on his lap, with no visible attributes. Candraprabha is the second to the left of Ja-liniprabha. He likewise possesses no visible attributes. Mandala no. 13: ?dkyamuni Kdya Mandala The fourth SDP mandala is the Sdkyamuni'32 or dkyamuni Kdya Mandala.' 33 The central figure is a golden Sakyamuni in dhydnamudrd.'34 Eight u*snsa deities surround him. Four offering goddesses are in the corners and four guardians are located in the gateways. According to the text, the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas are in a square surrounding the above. The examples of this mandaala in both Ngor 28 and NTMP 13:28, however, stop before the sixteen bodhisattvas. They contain only the seventeen deities enumerated above. Mada/ala no. 14: 2z9-Deity Dharmadhdtu Vdgisvara Maijufrf Mandala The sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas can also be found in three mandaalas based on the Man~jurri- ndma-sarmgiti (MNS), a text already encountered in the section on Jaliniprabha as an attendant of Maiijusri. Of these three mandalas, the first is the 21z-Deity Dharmadhdtu VdgfZvara Ma/juirf Mandala, "Speech-Lord of the Dharma-Realm,"'35 described in NSP 21. The central figure is Mafijusri or Mafijughosa.'36 He is white, four-headed and eight-armed, and is surrounded in the innermost circle by an additional thirty-six deities. In a first square around the circle are fifty-two goddesses, and sixteen more are located in a second square, two in each cardinal direction and two in each corner. The sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas are arranged two by two between these gate and corner deities in this second square. Outside all these is an outer circle that contains ninety-eight deities, bringing the total of the mandala to 219. In this mandala, the sixteen bodhisattvas are arranged according to de Mallmann's list three (Appendix C). Since the individual bodhisattvas are not described in MNS, we rely on the description in NSP 21. Jaliniprabha sits in the same position as in list one, at the end of the west side, just left of the northwest corner of the second square. Candraprabha, however, has moved from just left of the center gateway to the right of it, placing him to the immediate left of Jliniprabha. NSP says that J aliniprabha is "rose colored, a sword in the right hand, the sun on an abja lotus in the left hand."'37 132 SDP terminology. 133 Ngor terminology. This mandala is described in SDP, chapter II. I34 SDP, 37-38. 135 MNS, ch. 4, Wayman, 27-29, 66-67, or GDK, vol. 6, 430-630. To interpret MNS, Wayman relied on Bu-ston, vol. Pha, who in turn had relied on a commentary on the MNS by Mafijusrimitra. Wayman also used commentaries on MNS by Candrabhadrak:irti and SmrtijfianakIrti and NSP no. 21 (NSP 54-65, de Mallmann 1964, 82-96, 229-41 and de Mallmann 1975, 60-62).

In NTMP 12:21 he holds a sword in his right hand and a sun on a lotus in his left, conforming to NSP. Candraprabha's attribute is also indistinct in Ngor 40, but in NTMP 12:21, NTMP 13:40, and Lauf 26, he holds a lunar orb on a lotus. Maydala no. I5: Fifty-seven-Deity Samksiptakula Guhyaka Mandala A second mandala based on the MNS is the Fifty-seven-Deity Samksiptakula Guhyaka Mandala,'38 also called the Vajradhdtu Manal/a.'39 This mandaala resembles the Tibetan Fifty-three-Deity Vajradhdtu Mandala based on the STTS and described in NSP 19 that was discussed above.'40 A major difference is in the number of gatekeepers. The Fifty-seven-Deity Samksiptakula Guhyaka Mandala added a second group of four gatekeepers to the fifty-three deities of the STTS Vajradhdtu Mandala, bringing the total to fifty-seven. MNS on the other hand subtracted four gatekeepers, resulting in only forty-nine deities. A second difference is a matter of arrangement. In the Samksiptakula Guhyaka Mandala, the interior thirty-six deities are arranged around the central Vairocana in rings rather than grouped around each of the four subsidiary Tathagatas, as in the Vajradhdtu Mandaalas based on STTS. A third difference is that the sixteen bodhisattvas of the STTS mandala conform to de Mallmann's list one (Appendix A), whereas in this second MNS mandala the bodhisattvas follow her list two (Appendix B). The list of bodhisattvas for this mand'ala therefore differs both from the STTS mandalas, based on list one, and from the MNS mandala discussed immediately above, based on list three (Appendix C). In this mandala, the Sixteen Bodhisattvas of the Bhadrakalpa sit in a square surrounding the inner rings. Jaliniprabha is still in the last position in the West, but Candraprabha has now moved around the corner into the first position in the North. Neither Jaliniprabha nor Candraprabha is described in MNS. Wayman translated Jaliniprabha's name as "Ensnaring Light," in accordance with the definition in the Mahavyutpatti.'41 In Ngor 41, both of these bodhisattvas sit with the right hand over the chest, palm outward, and the left on the lap. No attributes are discernible. NTMP 13:41 is also devoted to this mandala, but only the central figure, Vairocana, is depicted. Manidala no. 16: Vddisimha Ma~juirr Mad'dala A third mandala based on MNS is the Manydala of Vddisimha Madjurri, with a red Mafijusri as the main figure, accompanied by a blue Sarasvati.'42 The pair is surrounded by four other Buddhas and the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, who sit in the order of de Mallmann's list two (Appendix B). According to Wayman,I43 Jaliniprabha is again the last figure in the West and holds a palace (g'yun drun 'khyil pa).'44 Candraprabha occupies the first position in the North, and holds an umbrella marked with a moon. I have not located an example of this mandala. 138 Ngor title. 139 Title according to MNS 2, chapter 54, 68-73. Also see ibid., 29-30. Wayman's translation of this chapter has relied on notes from commentaries by Smrtijfianakirti and Candrabhadrakirti, and on NSP 19. The text for this mandala is located in GDK VI: ff. 631- 703. Examples are found in Ngor 4IA &amp; B. Only its central figure is depicted in NTMP 13:41. 140 Tucci, Gyantse, 239, claims that MNS has derived from the STTS. 141 MNS 2, 73. 142 MNS, chapter VIII (MNS 2, 33-34, 86-98). 143 MNS 2, 90, quoting the commentator Candrabhadrakirti (Aryd-madjuri[--samgiti-namnavrtti, Tibetan translation in Peking Tanjur, vol. 75, I-I-I to 15-2-I). The Sixteen Bodhisattvas are discussed in 9-3-I1 to 9-3-8. 144 MNS 2, 90. 369</page><page sequence="24">Maydala no. 17: The Forty-three-Fold Mafijuvajra Mandala Another mandala which includes the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, but based on an unknown text, is the Mandala of Mafjuvajra in Forty-three Personifications'45 or the Ma a'ala of the Forty-three- Fold (Vairocana) Manjuvajra.'46 This man/dala is described in NSP 20,'47 and an example is included in NTMP (12:20). Mafijuvajra is in the center, surrounded by the four Tathagatas and four goddesses. Eight more goddesses are in a second circle. In the third circle are the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas, arranged in accordance with de Mallmann's list two. Thus Jaliniprabha is again at the end of the West side, and Candraprabha is the first one in the North. In this mandala all of these bodhisattvas have three faces and six hands, except for Maitreya, who has only four hands. Jaliniprabha has one pair of hands in dhydnamudrd, the second pair holds a bow and arrow, the third right performs abhaya- or varadamudrd and the left carries a solar disk on a blue lotus.'48 In NTM4P 12:20, Jaliniprabha conforms to this description, except the solar disk is held directly in his hand rather than on a lotus. Candraprabha's textual description resembles Jaliniprabha's except that he should hold a lunar circle on a blue lotus in his third left hand. On the illustration in NTMP I2:zo, he holds no attributes in his third pair of hands. Mandalas I8 and 19: Mahdvairocana Kdyamand/ala and Mahdvairocana Cittamand/ala A final pair of mandalas including the sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas is based on the Kriydsamgraha (KS) by Kuladatta, whose dates are unknown. The earliest extant manuscript of this text dates to the thirteenth to the fourteenth century. The text was translated into Tibetan by Kirticandra and Yar-luns-pa Grags-pa-rgyal-msthan, a Sakya abbot, who died about 1226 A.D.149 The two mandalas are really two versions of the same one: a kdyamaindala,'Is with anthropomorphic figures, and a cittamandala,I15 with symbols only. Both feature Mahavairocana as the central figure. The sixteen Bhadrakalpa bodhisattvas are located in the fourth circle surrounding Mahavairocana along with four outer offerings bodhisattvas and four gate guardians, arranged in accordance with de Mallmann's list one. Jaliniprabha is again the last one in the West, and Candraprabha has the second position in the West. According to the text for the kdyamanadala, Jaliniprabha carries a jdla, which can be translated as either a light or a net.'5s In the cittamandala his symbol is the vajra cage,'53 which we encountered in the Thirty-seven-Deity Navos.nsa Sdkyamuni Mandala discussed above. I have seen no examples of these two mangdalas. + + + 145 De Mallmann 1964 terminology.

In the Japanese Vajradhatu Mandala based on STTS, Jaliniprabha holds a jewelled net, but in the Tibetan version, he holds a vajra on a lotus in common with all four bodhisattvas of the Western quarter. In three of the mandalas based on SDP, the Thirty-seven-Principal Deity Sarvavid Vairocana Mandala, the Cakravarti Gua Maandala, and the Sdkyamuni Gdya Mandala, he holds no attribute, it is indecipherable, or I have not located an illustration. In the Thirty-seven- Deity Navosnisa Sdkyamuni Mandala, he is assigned a vajra cage (SDP) or a vajra net (NSP). However, in the example illustrated in NTMP 12:22, he actually holds a sun. Of the three mandalas based on MNS, he holds a sun on a lotus in the 21z-Deity Dharmadhdtu Vdgr-vara MaijuIr Mandala, an indiscernible attribute in the Fifty-seven-Deity Samksiptakula Guhyaka Mandala, and a "palace" in the Vadisirhha Mafijusri Mandala. In the Mandaala of Mafjuvajra in Forty-three Personifications from NSP 20, he holds a sun. In the Kdyamandala derived from KS, Jaliniprabha holds a jdla, which has been translated as either a light or a net. In the Cittamaandala, his attribute is the vajra-cage, the pakjararm. If we combine our findings from both functional categories of this bodhisattva, we have located him in a total of nineteen mangdalas. In four of these,'54 either in the text or in the example, he holds a jewelled net (jdla) and in two'55 he holds a vajra-cage (panjaram). Both of these attributes derive from the faulty translation of this bodhisattva's name. The textual basis for the mandalas which assign him a net are the MVS, at least in its Japanese interpretation, the Japanese version of STTS, and in the KdyamandIala based on the KS. The vajra-cage, vajrapaijaram, appears as his attribute in the Thirty- seven-Deity Navosnisa ?dkyamuni Manddala based on SDP and in the Cittamanidala of the KS. We can conclude that the faulty notion of the meaning ofJaliniprabha's name has crept into these four texts. In only four of the nineteen mandalas does Jaliniprabha hold a sun or a symbol of the sun. Three of these are linked to NSP and to the drawings in NTMP. Inasmuch as volume 12 of NTMP illustrates the mandalas of the NSP, it is not surprising that these two go hand-in-hand. The 21p-Deity Dharmadhdtu VdgiSvara Manjusri Maandala is ultimately based on MNS and its commentaries, but it was NSP 21 that specified the sun as Jaliniprabha's attribute, and the sun is clearly depicted on the illustration of this mandala in NTMP 12:21. For the Forty-three-Fold Ma-juvajra Mandala, known to us only through NSP 20, both the text and its illustration in NTMP present this bodhisattva holding a sun. Both the original text (SDP) for the Thirty-seven-Deity Navosnisa ?dkyanzuni Manadala and NSP 22 assign the vajrapanjaram to Jaliniprabha. However, in the example of this mandala in NTMP 12:22, the bodhisattva actually holds a sun and not the vajrapanj-aram. It would appear that the artist who drew this manddala for the NTMP collection had a different manuscript or edition of NSP than the one used by Bhattacharyya and de Mallmann in their edition of this compendium. The fourth manddala that illustrates Jaliniprabha with the proper attribute is the Tibetan Abhisambodhi Vairocana Maandala, based on the Vairocanabhisambodhitantra, the Tibetan translation of the Mahdvairocanasz7tra (MVS). This text states that Jaliniprabha holds "many precious nets." Yet in a group of images in the Baoxiang Lou which illustrates the Vairocanabhisamnzbodhitantra, an image of Jaliniprabha holds a symbol for the sun, a mask. Again, the artist who created this image must have had a text or an iconographic compendium which imparted the correct iconography for Jaliniprabha. Could it be that the original connotation of Jaliniprabha, in Tibet, rendered into Tibetan in the 371 I54 Nos. I, 2, 8, and I8. I55 Nos. ii and 19.</page><page sequence="26">Maha-vyutpatti as Dra ba can gyi 'od, did imply the "light of the sun" rather than a "net of lights" or "jewelled net" or "ensnaring light?" Perhaps these latter definitions are modern readings, incon- sistent with the thinking of the scholars of the ninth century. Of all the texts reviewed in this paper, the Nispannayogdvali (NSP) is the only one that specifies the sun as an attribute of Jaliniprabha. This text was written in Vikramasila Monastery in North India by Abhayakaragupta in the late eleventh to the early twelfth century, considerably later than most of the texts we have been examining. Abhayakaragupta first wrote a general manual of tantric liturgy called the Vajrdvalf, in which he referred to twenty-six main madndalas. In the Nispanna- yogdvalf, he set forth the details of these mandalas.'56 As source material, he must have had access to traditions in India that had not yet been tainted by the spelling error or by the faulty translation which so severely affected the iconography of Jaliniprabha. As for illustrations, with the correct interpretation, we have located two sources, one in North China, probably Beijing, and one in Mongolia. The workshop in North China produced the many pantheons of bronze images for the Qianlong Emperor in the eighteenth century including the two images which hold a mask, one located in the Baoxiang Lou, and the other in the collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Lokesh Chandra, in the introduction to his edition of NSP, noted the close relationship between the Tibeto-Chinese images of North China, including those in the Baoxiang Lou pantheons, with the Nispannayogdvali.'7 The other source for images of Jaliniprabha holding a sun is A New Tibeto- Mongol Pantheon (NTMP), originating in Mongolia. It is proper to conclude that the Tibetan Buddhist circles of North Asia retained (or returned in the eighteenth century to) the proper interpretation ofJaliniprabha as a sun bodhisattva. This sound scholarship in North Asia in the eighteenth century may have been due to Rolpay Dorje, the second Jangkya Hutuktu (1717-86). The Jangkya Hutuktus were the link between the Qing court and the Mongolian principalities. Rolpay Dorje in particular was a longtime acquaint- ance of Emperor Qianlong, enabling him to make Beijing a center of Buddhist learning. The many activities of this scholar included the supervision of a new Beijing edition of the Tibetan Tanjur and Kanjur, their translation into Mongolian and Manchu, a series of Buddhist dictionaries based on the work of Gelukpa scholars, the establishment of a school of tangka painting in Beijing, and, most important for our purposes, the compilation of several iconographical pantheons, including those illustrated by the bronze images of the Baoxiang Lou of Beijing.'58 Perhaps we owe to this great scholar the proper interpretation of this Buddhist sun bodhisattva, Jaliniprabhakumara. 372 is6 NTMP, XII, introduction. 157 NSP, I3-I4.
