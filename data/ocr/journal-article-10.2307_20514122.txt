<plain_text><page sequence="1">299 Freemasonry and the Second Spanish Republic By PATRICK J. GANNON, S.J. T HE Masonic origin and character of the Spanish Revolu tion of six years ago is understood by friend and foe in Spain, and, indeed, on the Continent generally, where the Order comes out much more into the open than in English speaking countries. The completeness of their success in 1931, when they set up their Republic without a drop of bloodshed thanks to the self-abnegation of the King-turned the heads of the Brethren a little. They forgot for the moment that they were a secret society, strictly non-sectarian and non-political. They threw aside the mask and even boasted of their spiritual offspring, the Second Republic, which was a worthy successor of the First Republic of 1868, equally Masonic and almost equally fraught with disaster to Spain and Europe. This feature of the dreadful imbroglio is, of course, passed over in silence by the great Press of the world. And the Masons themselves grew reticent as the days darkened, and they found themselves, like the sailors of Aeneas who had cut the bag of Aeolus, driving before a storm they could not control. It ;was soon seen that passions had been unleashed which would not be satisfied with Masonic theology or politics. The Comintern began to take a hand in the business, and the Grand Orient found itself divided from within and menaced from without by the more consistent anarchs in Barcelona, Valencia and Madrid. They</page><page sequence="2">300 THE IRISH MON TIIIL Y had overthrown one "tyranny" only to find themselves threatened by one far more terrible. And they had no policy save the old one of crushing L'Infime. They could deal with a defenceless church, which they had calumniated for generations. It was a famous victory; but their only one; and the methods by which it was won divided their own ranks. " Brother" L-Ierroux thought " Brother " Azania too precipitate and drastic; Brother " Caballero thought neither drastic enough; and the new regime oscillated from left to right until it found equilibrium in doing nothing but looking on while anarchy stalked the land. At length the army chiefs felt something must be done if any order or discipline was to survive. Hence the civil war. It is this aspect of affairs which a French writer, M. Jean MarquZes-RiviZere, has isolated for special study in a short volume, Comment La Franc-Ma9onnerie Fait Une Revolution (Editions Baudinieres, Paris, 1986). All should procure and read it who wish to get a little behind the scenes in the tragedy of Spain. There is nothing vague, hectic or rhetorical about this work. It is fully documented from Masonic sources themselves. He catches out the leading adepts of Spain and some other lands in moments of expansiveness, when they blurt out more perhaps than they would like to see remembered. But litera scripta manet, volat irrevocabile verbum, and our author has collected a sufficient number of these indiscretions to fix on Masonry a heavy responsibility for the downfall of Spain, perhaps of Europe -who knows as yet? I propose to synopsise his story. Virulent French Masonry entered Spain with the armies of Napoleon in 1809. A lodge was set up in Madrid under the title of The Star. Joseph Bonaparte himself was Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France, and he naturally encouraged an institution which favoured the propagation of French Revolu tionary influence in the Iberian peninsula.</page><page sequence="3">FREEMA i1SONE Y A ND SPAN1ISH REPUBLIC 301 With his downfall Masonry fell into disrepute and retired under ground. But in 1820 it emerged again, and by 1868 it was strong enough to set up the First Spanish Republic. The consequences for Spain and Europe (particularly for France) are notorious. But they were not in the original plan. Here is the programme presented by the Supreme Council of the Thirty Third Degrees to the Provisional Government: (1) Freedom for all cults; (2) Suppression of the Religious Orders and the charit able institutions dependent on them; (3) Secularisation of cemeteries; (4) Civil marriage; (5) Divorce; (6) Conscription for seminarists; (7) Abolition of ecclesiastical celibacy. (Almost identical verbally with Azafia's programme in 1931-2.) That the First Republic was the work of Masonry is vouched for by the fact that nearly all the leaders were Masons-General Prim, Malcampo, Sagasta, Dulce, Ruiz, Zorilla; and most of the commandants of the Navy, the revolt of which led up to the Republic. The testimony for this is a paper read in 1915 before the Grand Orient of Spain by the Grand Master himself, Miguel Morayta. It is hard to conceive of better evidence than this boastful admission. As the First Republic led to nothing but civil war within and the Franco-Prussian war without, Masonry once more lost caste with Spaniards, when at length peace was restored in 1874 by the restoration of monarchy. But the Grand Orient reminds one a little of the muskrats we have heard so much about. It burrows underground, multiplies rapidly, and tunnels under the founda tions of Christian society until the dykes collapse. Francis Ferrer, member of the Lodge called Truth in Barcelona, and later affiliated to the Grand Orient of France, soon appeared in the guise of a mild-mannered pedagogue. He established his Mlodern School, one pupil of which flung a bomb at the carriage of King Alfonso and Queen Ena in Madrid after</page><page sequence="4">302 THE IRISH MONTHL Y their marriage (which killed and wounded many about the carriage), and others, under the master himself, staged that fort night's Commune in Barcelona (1909), when almost every feature of July, 1936, wvas anticipated. Defeated and arrested, he was tried and shot-as dangerous a miscreant as ever paid the forfeit of crime. Yet the Press of Europe and America made a martyr of him. Let us see him a little nearer, this Masonic martyr.? At his villa a wonderfully secret " dug-out " was discovered, containing a mass of documents proving him a regular Bakunin in theory before attempting to be a Lenin in practice. In a letter to a friend he wrote: " In order not to shock people or give the Government a pre text for closing my establishments, I call them Modern Schools. But I frankly avow that my purpose is to form in these schools anarchists of conviction. For the nmoment we nmust be content with planting in the brain of vouth the ideal of violent upheaval. It must learn that against the policenzen and the tonsure there is only one mode of operationz-the bomb and poison." (Italics mine.) Already in 1892, in certain circulars addressed to revoltutionary elements, he had written: " Comrades, let us be men; let us crush these infamous bourgeois. . . . Before building up let us destroy everything. . . . If any politician appeal to your humanity kill him. . . . Abolition of all laws. Expulsion of all religious communities.... Dissoluition of the magistracy, the army, the navy.... Destruction of churches." (It xx4ll be noted that this was written many years before " Fascism "' was heard of. Yet to-day this undefined enormity, imputed without semblance of proof to the whole Spanish priesthood, is made an all-sufficient excuse for the wholesale immolation of cleries and the destruction of churches. The teaching of Bakunin, Marx and Ferrer, the</page><page sequence="5">FREEMASONRY AND SPANISH REPUBLIC 303 campaign of hatred waged by the Lodges are conveniently ignored.) The Press in France, England and America never, of course, printed these disclosures. In Spain it did, and once more Masonry submerges till even its conning tower is invisible. It manceuvres under the surface till the Dictatorship of Primo de Riven gives it a chance of once more championing " liberty " of its own choice brand. It foments and fosters discontent, em ploying the Intelligentsia of the Atenco Club. It had plenty of material to go upon. The Spaniards are in reality the most indi vidualistic of races and impatient of restraint. Further, they are regionalists and resent centralisation of government. There was indeed a quite considerable section of theoretical anarchists. Moreover, there vere real and deep-seated abuses calling for redress. No one is clearer or franker in this last admission than M. Marques Riviere. Yet he blames the Dictator most for his handling of the Masons. Primo had ample proof that certain Lodges were centres of anti-monarchist intrigue. He had them raided and closed down. He then submitted their secret and very cryptic documents to a commission of investigation. Before this could report his own fall wvas accomplished. He had thrown down the gage of battle without being able or willing to grapple with the many-headed hydra. From the moment he attacked the brethren the world Press and high finance began taking an interest in the game. The peseta was fought on the Bourses and brought down about eight points. This was the last straw for the Dictatorship. It fell. And then the Lodges had the King isolated. They openly avowed their determination to upset the throne. By 1930 their plans were laid. A revolt was attempted by Masonic soldiers, Firman Galan, Franco (not the General of to-day) and Macia, under Masonic inspiration. And a shadow</page><page sequence="6">304 THE IRISH MON, TIIL Y cabinet was already in being to take over from the King. Its president was Alcala Zamora, who always proclaimed himself a c Catholic," but later, as President of the Republic, with a salary of ?60,000 a year, did not scruple to sign the death-warrant of the Church. Of the other ten ministers seven were notorious Masons. Here are the names: Indalecio Prieto, Miguel Maura, Alejandro Lerroux, Fernando de los Rios, Manuel Azania, Santiago Casares, Alvaro de Albornoz, Largo Caballero, Martinez Barria, Nicolau d'Olver. Of these only Mauira, Casares and d'Olver were not avoved initiates. The number of Masons in Spain was abotut 5,000 out of a population of 23,000,000. Seven portfolios ouit of ten is not bad representation even for an e6lite of 5,000. When the King abdicated, the Bulletin of the Thirty-Third Degree, edited by the Supreme Council, wrote: " There has been founded in Spain a Republic based upon the three great and unalterable principles, fundamental and exclu sive basis of every human organisation: liberty, equality, frater nity. W . . XVe can say that it is the perfect image, moulded by careful hands, of our doctrines and our principles. It is not possible to realise a revolution more perfectly Masonic than the Spanish revolution. . . . The immense moral patrimony which Spain has just acquired is, before all and above all, the patrimony of our institution. We consecrate ourselves with unshakable faith and invincible resolve to defend and protect it." In order to do this more effectively they occupied all the key positions and important offices under the new regime. Here is M.

Largo Caballero and Companys, we have a catalogue of nearly all the names that shine like stars in the firmament of the Second Republic from 1931 to 1986. Beyond all doubt then, the Second Republic was even more Masonic than the First. (Fifty-five members of the First Corks Constituentes were Brethren.) It was even less succcessful. Professor Allison Peers has just told the story of the Quinquen nium, certainly without bias against the new rulers, and it makes melancholy reading. It moves from the tumultuous rejoicing of the early days to a finale which he entitles Chaos-the chaos which rendered civil war inevitable. The great Brotherhood has little reason to boast of its achieve ment now. For it cannot even plead that it did not seize power, did not assume responsibility, did not dictate policy. This, too, our author proves documentally. I can only do partially what he has done very fully. The reader should purchase his volume and study it thoroughly. It places fairly and squarely upon the shoulders of the Grand Orient the guilt of sowing the whirlwind in Spain. For the Lodges not only installed their representa</page><page sequence="9">FREEMASONRY AND SPANISH REPUBLIC 307 tives in power; they prescribed for these the utmost fidelity in their posts to the principles and commands of the Order, under threat of excommunication and other penalties not further speci fied. All this took place at a Convent of the Grand Orient held in Madrid on April 12th, 1982, of which the proceedings were published in the Grand Bulletin of the Spanish Grand Orient for September loth, 1932. Among the disciplinary decrees we read: -(1) Brothers hold ing public offices muist renew their oath to explain and justify to their Masonic superiors their conduct in these offices . . . . as also to receive directions and pay heed to them. (2) The Lodges are to collaborate with the Brothers in public posts. (3) The Brothers holding such posts are to remember their duty of brotberly love and toleration, and they must always place this Masonic fraternity above all the differences that nmight divide them in political struggles. (4) They must exercise themselves in the spirit of absolute respect for the political ideas of the Brothers, without the slightest party aim or tendency, but exclu sively for the defence of the great principles of the auigust Order. (5) A vast Masonic propaganda is to be organised. And finally the fundamental principles of the Order must be clearly formu lated by the Assembly. Everything turns on them, and the document proceeds to elucidate them. The relaxation in the Order comes from the forgetfulness of them. They pertain to the religious, political and social spheres. " The religious is the most important and is at the basis of all the rest. Becauise every political or social doctrine must rest on an ethic and this in turn on a metaphysic, that is to say, on an attempt a-t an explanation of the universe, this explanation being a religion in the widest sense of the word. " At present in Spain the religious problem is so burning that Masonry must explain precisely and clearly its position on the</page><page sequence="10">308 THE IRISH lMOlNTHLY subject. It will be well to repeat that Masonry is not irreligious, that it combats no religious sentiment or belief, but only dogmatic intolerance. " To discover the common root of our religionis or, if youi prefer the word, philosophic opinions, the root which ought to produce our brotherliness and toleration, it will suffice to demand in the Lodges a more profound and serious study of the principles, symbolism, doctrine and rituals of Masonry. "And then it will be seen that Masons-alike those who behold in the Great Architect of the UTniverse an anthropomorphic or personal God, and those who conceive Him as a universal con science, or even those who see in Him merely cosmic energy are all obliged to seek in this guiding principle the moral ground of conduct. From this it can be deduced that in this wide sense Masonry is profoundly religious, and that, just because it is so, it cannot permit the intolerance of any dogmatism, least of all that to wh'ich is wanting the profound spiritual unrest which impels us to the search after truth, the coping stone of the ideal temple wve seek to construct. " I translate this passage as best I can, admitting that the last few lines are cryptic to the point of obscurity. I take them to mean that while Masonry combats all dogmatic teaching, it combats most of all the teaching which ends Forschung or eternal seeking, described by Lessing as better than the possession of Truth. This ambiguity in the tail means little however. The drift of the whole elaborate paragraph is clear. Masonry holds, as its fundamental principle, the existence of a Supreme Archi tect, but He may be (1) an anthropomorphic or personal God (as if the two ideas were identical), or (2) a universal conscience (Whatever that may mean), or (3) merely cosmic force (such as the law of gravity). It is a somewhat jejune first principle and certainly sets little</page><page sequence="11">FREE4MASONRY AND SPAN7ISH REPUBLIC 309 litnit to the scope of free inquiry. It would be harmless enough (and merely silly from the metaphysical standpoint) if it were not coupled with a further and more active first principle, namely, war upon those who dare to think that there are a few more dogmas, reasonably demonstrated and therefore true. Here is the sting in the tail of Grand Orient Liberalism, and it means war on all genuine Christianitv. Yet because of the mere talismanic namie of Masonry it can win a world-wide sympathy for its agents even when they are undermining the basis of our whole civilisation. It is true that Masonry, for all its strict discipline, could not keep its initiates wholly united under the stress of events. Lerroux reacted against anarchy and the dissolution of Spain. General Ochoa rescued Oviedo from the Reds of Asturias, and either resigned from his Lodge or was expelled. General Caba nellos, the only one of the present Patriot generals who was ever a Mason, repudiated the Brotherhood. The Intellectuals, whether initiates or not, soon found that, with religion, art, science, literature, liberty, and a host of other good things were disappear ing under the tyranny of mob law. (Was it not Unamuno him self who defined the state of things as " the reign of lunacy "?). But official Masonry remained loyal to the Frente Popular; and as late as October 20, 1936, declared authoritatively in the A. B. C. of Madrid (now converted into a Red newspaper) that Spanish Masonry is completelv, totally and absolutely with the Popular Front." Yet this does not prevent certain publicists in Catholic lands from asserting the contrary, namely, that Franco and his followers bask in the smiles of the Grand Orient.</page></plain_text>
