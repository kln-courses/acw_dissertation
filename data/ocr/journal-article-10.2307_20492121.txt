<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH ARTS REVIEW BRONZE BY GOLD, THE WORK OF IRISH WOMEN SCULPTORS believe it is correct to say that there is no public perception of the huge body of work by women sculptors in Ireland since the end of the Second World War. The names of women painters come readily enough to mind but there is, somehow, a subconscious idea that sculpt ure is a male province and preserve. It is incontestable that two women painters, Mainie Jellett and Evie Hone, led the Modernist movement in Ireland, and I think it is equally incontestable that the sculptor, Hilary Heron, led the equival ent movement in sculpture. Lawrence Campbell, Frederick Herkner, and par ticularly Oisin Kelly, all had leanings towards Modernism but Hilary Heron was the artist whose work was most rad ical in the years immediately after the war, even if then very heavily influenced by Henry Moore. Heron quickly developed her own par ticular style of witty invention, moving from wood-carving to metal and stone. Her most innovative work was in a com bination of both, as in the Lithodendron series of stone and copper flower pieces, which combine an innocent, light-heart ed spirit with an original, skilful and economic use of materials. She rarely worked to a large scale; her 'Crazy Jane' (1958) welded-steel figure, based on W.B. Yeats's series of poems of that name, stands ninety-two inches high and is probably her largest work, whereas her male contemporaries at the time, such as Ian Stuart, were to take on very much larger works in the following decade. Another artist working at this time was the sculptor, Melanie le Brocquy, whose small, rather careful, but distin guished bronzes held their own in their quiet way throughout the experimental '60s when three women, Deborah Brown, Alexandra Wejchert, and Gerda Fromel, held a dominant position in the forefront of Irish sculpture. Deborah Brown grew up in Belfast and began her career as a painter, but relief elements gradually began to hold more importance than the picture plane. Initially these relief forms were made in papier-mache mounted on painted canvas; these gave way to fibre glass forms mounted on painted canvas, all in an abstract idiom. The relief forms acted in conjunction or counterpoint to pierced forms cut in the backing canvas, all of this sculptural interaction mingling with the interaction of colour in both the fibreglass itself and the painted can In an enthusiastic and sympathetic article, Dorothy Walker a prominent art critic, gives some account of sculpture made by women in Ireland during the past half-century. vas. The play of light, both sunlight and artificial light, was another factor in these pieces and, understandably, it was not long before the artist developed these relief forms into free-standing, three dimensional sculpture of pure colourless fibreglass, in which the material was stretched to the limits of its own lacy strength. In the 1980s Deborah Brown has returned to her early use of papier mdche in figurative work of groups of people and animals which, although vested with a keen observation of natural form, are, nevertheless, of very much less interest and strength than her fibreglass abstractions. Alexandra Wejchert trained as an ar chitect in her native Poland before com ing to Ireland in 1965. Her early work consisted of relief constructions of short pegs inserted in a painted background in dynamic rhythms which created effects of wave movements, a cross between Op art and kinetic art, both popular at the time. Later her work became more direct ly sculptural in the notable series of free standing pieces she made for the Bank of Ireland in coloured plexiglass. Here her architect's feeling for the use of materials, allied to her artist's imagination, made of the unpromising commercial material a distinguished and lively art based on her grasp of the malleability of the sheet of plastic and the curious fact that the cut edge of the sheet becomes a different col our from the sheet itself. She was there fore able to make almost purely linear sculpture by exploiting the sheet's edge colour, while holding the sheet's trans parent curving plane as the main sculpt ural element. These baroque pieces in fluenced younger sculptors like Michael Bulfin, who also produced some in teresting plexiglass sculpture during this period. Wejchert has also worked in metal, as in her giant stainless steel piece at the Allied Irish Bank Bankcentre in Ballsbridge, and her golden wall-relief in the Irish Life Building in Lower Abbey Street, Dublin. One of her most suc cessful pieces was a combination of chromium and clear plastic tubing which was exhibited some years ago in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art and in the Irish Marketing Institute. Probably the most versatile sculptor working in Ireland in the '60s and early '70s was the Czech-born artist, Gerda Fromel. She and her husband, Werner Schurmann, came to Ireland in 1955. He also was a sculptor and bronze-caster. Schurmann, who had a fine bass voice, eventually abandoned sculpture for op eratic singing and returned to his native Germany, while Fromel remained in Ireland with their three sons and devel oped her own career as a sculptor with great dedication and success. Her early work was in bronze, in a romantic Sym bolist style, having much in common with the Italian sculptor, Medardo Rosso, involving tree forms and the heads of small children. While close to a potentially dangerous area of sentimentality, the delicacy and tenderness of her touch avoided this pit fall and her work developed, in time, to a totally abstract form where her essen tial gentleness of character was sustained with immense strength by the materials she used, marble and alabaster particul arly, but also stainless steel. It is interest ing, in formal terms, that her Central European background, and her training as a student in Munich, led her to de velop the romantic tendencies of her nature, as in her bronze 'Girl' and her tiny monumental 'Castle'. When she came to Ireland, however, her work evolv ed towards an abstract mode, echoing not only cup-mark carvings on pre historic monuments in the Irish coun tryside, but Celtic ornamentation of positive / negative, inner / outer forms, embodied in large-scale, free-standing and often mobile sculpture. She captured light and movement in her work first by means of the materials she used such as translucent alabaster and polished stain less steel, but also by a hard-earned simplicity won from the forms, 'embody ing enjoyment of the spiritual through the materials,' to quote James Johnson Sweeney. The poetic quality of her sculpture is easily grasped in her small pieces, whether abstract or figurative, but it is even more remarkably evident in the very large sculpture in Carroll's factory in Dundalk: the polished stainless steel has fitting technological overtones suit -207</page><page sequence="2">IRISH ARTS REVIEW BRONZE BY GOLD, THE WORK OF IRISH WOMEN SCULPTORS able to the industrial factory building, which is a very fine work of architecture, but the poetic idea of the three tall 'sails' turning in the wind and reflecting in the water of the pool in which they stand, re affirms the harmony of architecture and sculpture. She has considerable expertise in steel and made many abstract pieces with moveable parts. One of these large scale steel pieces is unfortunately very badly sited in the Setanta Centre in Dublin, unlike the beautiful siting at the Carroll's factory in Dundalk. Through out the various media in which she show ed her technical skill, a spiritual quality always shone through. Fromel was drown ed in a tragic accident off the west coast of Ireland in 1975 at the height of her powers. Irish sculpture is lucky to have ac quired so many foreign artists of talent. Imogen Stuart was born and trained in Germany before marrying the sculptor, Ian Stuart, and moving to Ireland in the early '50s. Her work has largely consisted of church commissions and she has suc ceeded Oisin Kelly as the leading prac titioner of religious art. Inevitably her Eilis O'Connell, Kendo, 1986, painted steel, 72 x 30 x 10.

In the early 1970s two remarkable young women, Eilis O'Connell and Vivienne Roche, began to show their work. Both had been students of the Cork sculptor, John Burke, at Cork School of Art and their early work clearly showed his in fluence in large-scale abstract pieces in painted steel, beautifully made. Whatever else John Burke may have imparted to them and to his subsequent students, he certainly taught them how to make their work, with impeccably polished, stylish technical skills. They have both won numerous awards and competitions. O'Connell won the competition for a Memorial to the aviatrix, Amelia Erhardt, on the site of her landing near Derry. This tall white marble column acts as a wind in strument at the conjunction of a grid of paths on the site; she also won the first GPA Award for Emerging Artists, a British Council fellowship for a year at the British School in Rome, and the first Mont Kavanagh Award; she represented Ireland at the last Paris Biennale des Jeunes in 1982, and recently won the Ireland/PS I Fellowship in New York. In the late 1970s O'Connell injured her back lifting heavy steel and had to forego using that material. Her work then enter ed a highly creative phase, in which she freely experimented with other materials, notably her own hand-made paper. She in corporated much organic material into this paper: stones, slate, feathers, shells, so that the material itself was quite sculptural and from this she made further sculptural constructions, often to a large scale, such Vivienne Roche, Bell Sound Sculpture, bronze and steel.

A trip to Brazil, where she represented Ireland with three other young artists at the Sao Paolo Bienal in 1985, also had a distinct in fluence on her work. She easily incor porated the rich colours and exotic forms of bird and plant life from the tropical jungle into her work, especially a par ticular blue which she has used to hand some effect in small-scale painted steel pieces, often combined with organic mat erials, paper, feathers etc. While using organic materials, and balancing them, unusually, against sophisticated painted steel, her work has retained all its elegance and style, with the added interest of organic textures. Vivienne Roche has remained faithful to the more architectural concerns of clear-cut steel. As she lives near the sea on Cork Harbour, her sculpture is often related to the forms of sailing and boats, beautiful objects in themselves, and easily lending their forms to abstract sculpture. Until 1988, her major public piece was her prize-winning white steel memorial to the late President Cearbhall 0 Dalaigh, situated on the village green in Sneem, Co. Kerry, near the art-loving President's home. In 1988, she won one of the Dublin Millenium Sculpture Symposium awards for a site adjoining St Patrick's Cathedral in the Liberties, and her large stylized steel bell was one of the first of ten new public sculptures to be installed. Of the ten win ning projects, six were by young women sculptors, bringing to public notice a whole new generation of sculptural talent to which I will return later. Yet another Cork sculptor is the very stylish, witty and subversive artist, Dorothy Cross. Her series of 'Contrap tions' were architecturally-based, free standing spires and towers made of timber or lead, and often combined with wall pieces incorporating antique prints. Again, her work is beautifully made, ex quisite joinery work in timber, often allied with gold leaf and bronze. Her 1988 solo exhibition in the Douglas Hyde Gallery during the International Sculpt ure Conference in Dublin, combined the architectural structures with a new anthropomorphic concern related to men and women and their reciprocal gender fears, all conveyed with a witty surrealism that infused the somewhat dry timber structures with a satirical twist. -~~~~~~~~~~1 - Cathy Carman, I cannot say who he sleeps with now, but I can say he does not sleep alone, 1987, elm, 176 x 36 x 39 cms. Craftsmanship of the mind -in Berkeley's words-as well as of the hand, is apparent in the work of a young sculptor, Liadin Cooke, who graduated from the National College of Art and Design in 1987. Her masterly installation at the Projects Art Centre, 'Making a Dream', was a sophis ticated tour-de-force for a young artist. The installation included several indiv idual works such as the 'Sea-box', a long minimalist steel box filled with blue pig ment, with a symbolic sea-to-sky thin bronze ladder on the surface, and a rock island emerging from the blue. 'Sailing through a closed door' was a wall drawing handled on a huge scale with certainty and poise, a small bronze boat leading the geometric quadrant-angle through a corner and on to the adjoining wall. The poetic 'Sea envelope' was a lead envelope high on the wall, filled with blue which overflowed down the wall and on to the floor. The poetic theme of a dream journey found surprisingly apt expression in the minimalist style of the steel and lead constructions, animated aesthetically by the rich cobalt blue. At the other extreme from these con cerns is the rough-hewn timber sculpture of Cathy Carman, Sally Houston, and Jackie McKenna. Carman's crudely fash ioned squatting women have a deliberate feminist brutality, eschewing the dainty, and celebrating tough, battered survival. Her powerful standing figure, 'I know not who he sleeps with now but I know he does not sleep alone is a moving version of the old Irish poem, 'I know not who Eimear sleeps with tonight but I know she does not sleep alone: Sally Houston has likewise worked in rough-hewn tim ber with large chisel-marks rhythmically hacking out the surface. Occasionally her pieces are painted in Expressionistic colours which reinforce the Expression ist nature of the carvings; these pieces work unexpectedly well out of doors, particularly the more artificial-looking pieces such as the bright red and green construction in Fernhill Gardens, Co. Dublin. The Sculptors Society of Ireland, of which all these young women are mem bers, and of which one of the most active is the sculptor, Cliodna Cussen, is an ad mirable body which has considerably ad vanced the scope of public sculpture and has organized symposia in different mat erials-timber, steel, stone, etc. The tim ber symposium was held in a beautiful -209</page><page sequence="4">IRISH ARTS REVIEW BRONZE BY GOLD, THE WORK OF IRISH WOMEN SCULPTORS wood, Hazelwood, on the shores of Lough Gill in Co. Sligo. The lifesize figure of an old woman carved in timber by the young sculptor, Jackie McKenna, is one of the best integrated, looking en tirely natural in the woodland setting, searching the ground at her feet as if look ing for mushrooms, and reminiscent of early Malevich paintings of Russian peasants. Caroline Mulholland is an artist from Northern Ireland, one of the few contem porary artists who can produce credible bronze portrait sculpture. Her charming bronze chair for the Dublin Millenium is now placed at the bottom of George's Street for the 'walkers' weary shankes' to rest; the back of the chair grows into leafy branches to give shade to the sitters. Other projects for the Millenium which have been realized are Rachel Joynt's bronze, brass, and concrete imprints of runner-soles, shoes and birds on the pedestrian traffic island on O'Connell Bridge in the heart of the city, and Betty Maguire's half-submerged Viking ship I Jackie McKenna, Wood Gatherer, beech.

Kathy Prendergast is one of the most gifted artists of her generation. Although her output is relatively limited, her work is of concentrated exquisiteness that well merits waiting for it. Her small bronzes have a unique poetic quality, both in their unusual dream-like subject-matter and in the concentration of their execu tion. The larger works, like her white chalk wall in Rosc '88, are equally ex quisite. The wall, made like a traditional dry-stone 'lace' wall in the West of Ireland, was made of pure white chalk rocks, but the centre section was shaded by incredibly delicate drawing with a fine mapping pen, making 'contours' on the rock in short straight lines. Her drawing has always been exquisite and has often related to maps or technical drawing related to her own body. Equally ex quisite craftsworking, on a tiny scale, is the hallmark of the ceramic sculptor, Marie Foley, who makes minute, com Lily van Oost, Growth, wood and synthetic fibres 20 x 6.5 m, exhibited at the Bank of Ireland Exhibition Hall in 'Fibre Art '88'.

A whole range of women sculptors work in the area of organic natural materials, which seem to come more naturally to them than the technological materials like steel. Helen Comerford was one of the first feminist sculptors who, in the mid-'70s made abstract forms in fibreglass very specifically related to the female form. However, she soon veered from these to more subtle, abstract works in layered paper completely covered in graphite, stitched together to form large surfaces. Making paper seems to be an attractive option for women artists, and Comer ford has realized successful projects in this area. In fact her most virtuoso work was a life-size environment, 'Molly Bloom's Bedroom' made entirely of papier-mache, as a memorial to James Joyce in 1982, the year of the Joyce Centenary. In this she achieved a sophis ticated paradox in the treatment of col our and pattern: although the entire work was monochrome, the pale muddy colour of the untreated material, by rais ing all the patterned surfaces, such as wallpaper, clothing etc, into three dimensional relief, successfully conveyed the idea of colour with which the room was filled. Comerford also worked in a serial vein, using 'bags' of fibreglass filled according to a graduated system of colour. Women artists also seem to relate more directly to the land and to nature, par ticularly in sculpture. Although Oisin Kelly was a pioneer in creating landscape sculpture, many women have adopted this approach. Aileen McKeogh has devel oped a courageous theme of landscape sculpture, using branches and twigs in works which are more successful in a non-objective mode, when using the material in a purely organic manner to create her own individual landscape. When the pieces are more directly nar rative or representational, they teeter on a decorative edge which is on the brink of toy- or model-making. Louise Walsh, on the other hand, is a very strong young artist, working in somewhat similar materials, branches, found objects in natural materials, baskets and so on, which all go to be ground in a convincing feminist mill, emerging as telling, poetic, stringent images of women in various guises. Her women are often half-beast, such as the horse, which enjoys in Ireland an extraordinary status not only as a handsome animal which may also be the means of winning a few pounds, but as a traditional beast of burden, and a myth ical Celtic goddess. Walsh combines the equally numerous aspects of woman, in cluding the mythical, with the image of the horse to make a neat feminist point about both; in spite of their mythical status, beauty, etc., they are still widely perceived as useful domestic animals. She does not, however, labour her fem inism in a hectoring tone; her work is always poetic, ambiguous, but strong and dynamic. Other artists working in the area of found materials are Betty Oliver-Brown and Eilis Nf Fhaolain. The former has made more straightforward animal images than Louise Walsh but, as such, they are inventive, dynamic images which catch the basic movement and structure of her life-size animals with precision and accuracy, in spite of the un promising nature of the plastic bowls, toys, kitchen utensils, clothing and other odds and ends that she uses. Eilis Nf Fhaolain's quirky humour in her studies of life-size cows, for example, carries on the witty tradition of Hilary Heron, but again through a medium of genuine arte povera, sections of abandon ed cars, chicken wire, papier-mache, and so on. It may be that women's traditional role of seeking to create harmony and system in the ceaseless chaos of domestic life has given them a gift for this kind of ad hoc solution and making the best of whatever is to hand. Angela Morrissy uses old nylon tights to make expressive stuffed figures. Expressionist sculpture does seem to tend towards being a male preserve, except for Cathy Carman, and to some extent, the blunt carving of Sally Houston; it also tends to be in timber, although ceramic sculpture would seem to be a natural medium for such concerns. Una Walker, another Northern artist, uses directly domestic elements in her ritual installations, for example, pottery bowls and pottery in the form of soda bread, offerings of salt, decoration of reeds and leaves. These are assembled, however, in the perpetual geometry of circles, triangles and squares, thus com bining the organic and the geometric in these private, home-based, but quite large-scale pieces which, despite their domestic privacy, still have a public validity. Even more domestic in char acter are Lily van Oost's amazing knitted sculptures. Van Oost is a Dutch artist liv ing in the Black Valley near Killarney, Co. Kerry; she knits amazing clothing also, wool coats and jerseys which are truly sculptural, but her recent work has increased to a wild scale, vast curtains of spaced-out knitting and crochet, some times including whole figures, at other times purely abstract mountainous sculptures of wool. Teresa McKenna also incorporates tapestry and weaving into her work but in a constructivist fashion, i.e. combined with timber structures. Her wall draw ings on cut-out buckram, maroufle on paper were extremely interesting both in technique and in their archaeological subject-matter. Archaeology and pre history tend to be areas that interest women artists, perhaps in nostalgia for the power-era of the Mother Goddess but also, I think, in a desire to recapture a pre male-dominated world. There is a dual activity among women artists: one is to start the past afresh, to go back far enough to an innocent equality of male and female; the other is to lay claim to the future in the practice of new media which have not yet become male-dominated, e.g. video, performance, sound, and other new forms. Irish women sculptors have been particularly active in this lat ter field, and of these the most outstand ing is the young woman performance artist, Alanna O'Kelly. She began as a sculptor working in similar organic mat erials to many of the foregoing artists, us ing flax, wicker, and other natural materials, as in her installation in the ex hibition 'Without the Walls' at the ICA in London in 1980. Another outstanding installation of hers was 'Barriers' at the Project Arts Centre, Dublin, which filled the gallery space with the massive timber posts used to counter land erosion on the Wexford coast. This piece worked on several levels of meaning, both visual and psychological, and was a remarkably powerful, uncompromising work for a young artist. She has also devised more ambitious outdoor installations centred on the midsummer solstice, rather less original in concept. But she has reached a genuine peak of originality in her solo voice performances. While based on traditional Irish keening, she has created a uniquely personal vehicle which she uses in abstract, serial, wordless but in -211</page><page sequence="6">IRISH ARTS REVIEW BRONZE BY GOLD, THE WORK OF IRISH WOMEN SCULPTORS tensely moving calls, with all the emot ional power of the human voice strictly contained in a structured sequence. Later works, such as 'Chant down Greenham' involved a more complex and more ambitious sound environment in which the recorded sound of approachng helicopters was relayed from various points, filling the space, while O'Kelly's live voice pitched its sequence of chants against the mechanical menace. This is one of the most powerful and most mov ing live performances of any I have seen in twentieth-century performance art, heart-rending to witness as the live voice rises passionately to hold its human own against the machine, almost failing, but like the highest E-string note of a Heifetz Beethoven sonata, finally, agonizingly, reaching the summit. O'Kelly has also made notable video work and installa tions at an easier level but none ap proaching the intensity of her voice performances. Pauline Cummins, male torso from Inis t-Oirr, slide/sound installation. Shown at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, December 1985. Pauline Cummins, on the other hand, is an accomplished video artist, who is also active in organizing women artists' events, exhibitions, seminars etc. Her video piece, 'Inis t-Oirr', unites drawing, knitting patterns laid over a nude male torso, and her own erotic narrative in her distinctly seductive voice. She has also made purely sound works, in a feminist strain, which can be listened to with ear phones. She is now beginning to gain in ternational recognition for her work, as indeed is O'Kelly who has performed in the UK, USA, and at Documenta 8 in West Germany. One of the most in teresting and inventive younger artists working in this area is the young Derry artist, Moira McIver, who has produced very accomplished and beautifully made video installations, based more on fem inist politics than on the expected Derry issues of violence or nationalism. The work of artists like Cummins and O'Kelly in mixed technological media is also Linda Brunker, Foliose, Bronze. Courtesy Sculptors Society of Ireland. -212</page><page sequence="7">IRISH ARTS REVIEW BRONZE BY GOLD, THE WORK OF IRISH WOMEN SCULPTORS reflected in more traditional mixed media by other artists. The painter, Alice Maher, for example, has created a spatial en vironment in her installation 'Maculata' at the GPA Emerging Artists exhibition in the Douglas Hyde Gallery in 1988. Four painted sheets, representing four decades of the Rosary, based on four episodes in the life of the Virgin Mary -the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, and the Coronation-were hung at varying heights and angles to create an iconographic colour-space. While basically feminist in intent, the work incorporated expert iconographic information in great detail such as the image of the Virgin Mary giving birth with no expression of labour pains. The Church teaching on the matter is that the Virgin, being sinless, did not suffer the ills of this wicked world but gave birth without pain, and in consequence during the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the most intense period of devotion to the Blessed Virgin, she is never depicted lying-in, at the Nativity. Another detail of Alice Maher's installa tion concerns the midwife Salome who, in the Apocryphal Gospels, is alleged to have doubted the virgin birth, and to have had her hand withered when touching Mary's genitals. Drawing is often a preoccupation of sculptors. The Derry artist Mhairi Sutherland has used her considerable drawing skill to make impressive in situ wall drawings, or rather, part in situ: she commences her drawings on paper, strange hair-line images of satirical an imals, often with political overtones, and then pastes them to the wall and con tinues the drawing across the wall. Catherine Mulvihill has a different technique of commencing a drawing on the wall and then bringing it out into three dimensions. Since her subject matter is also concerned with elements of building construction or interiors, the drawing/sculpture often has a further il lusionist effect. Mary Farl Powers is one of the best engravers in Ireland, with vir tuoso skills in etching and lithography. In the last year or two, her engraving has become steadily more sculptural, with embossing and other similar techniques, until last year she produced completely three-dimensional work in water-colour on paper. These very beautiful abstract pieces give hope that she may develop in to an interesting sculptor. Of all the various materials that have been grist to the mill of women sculptors, glass has been noticeably absent. This is curious in a country which has a long glass craft tradition, and also because of the nature of glass itself. It is such a sculptural, malleable, and inherently decorative aesthetic material, capable of taking any shape demanded of it, but also sustaining any number of surface dec orating techniques-etching, blasting, cutting etc;-and even having that dom estic quality and usage which so many women artists like to exploit in their work. The Cork stained glass artist, Maud Cotter, makes constructivist sculpture with infill panels of stained glass. It is, however, a rather limited use of the material; basically she is making a three-sided window, like a small glass tent, with leaded sections in the tradi tional method. While this does produce a certain aesthetic effect, it seems to me that a medium of such potential could be taken to more interesting conclusions. Cork, however, still continues to pro duce pioneering sculptors, working now in quite different media from the John Burke school of painted steel. Sheila Long is a very young artist, who has pro duced large-scale coloured 'monsters', albeit friendly monsters-no doubt she watched the Muppets as a child. These large light-hearted beings have a delight ful character and are imaginatively made with, again, many organic, found objects like shells embedded in their painted plaster and fibreglass forms. On the other hand, a young artist like Geraldine Lucie, also in Cork, has shown very elegant minimal timber sculpture, beautifully carved and finish ed, quite small in scale, but extremely poised. So the Modernist wheel has turn ed back to these young women and their traditional skills, and their very wide range of sculptural concerns. In this con text I will finish with one of last year's sculpture graduates from the National College of Art and Design, a young girl named Linda Brunker whose poetic bronze figures made of bronze oak leaves astonished not only the foundry where she did her innovative casting but also the public who rushed to buy her work. Her concerns are again based on land scape and nature, and her figures, when shown in the romantic woodland gar dens of Fernhill at the foot of the Dublin Mountains, seem to take form from the leafy undergrowth. Seamus Heaney asks in a recent poem 'How habitable is the perfect form?' The perfect form is habitable when the underlying idea, the artist's intention, and the medium used to express that intention and idea, coal esce so closely and with such crucial balance that an ardent energy is released, breathing life into inert matter.
