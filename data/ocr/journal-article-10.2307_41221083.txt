<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rimbaud Rules DAPHNE MERKIN it seems as if anyone who has ever aspired to hipness has Sometimes laid claim to the nineteenth-century poète maudit and Ur-Bad Boy Arthur Rimbaud. He was born to be wild, a room-trashing rock star with a passion for drugs, drink, and degradation well before the prototype existed - or so we have come to think. Rimbaud's mythic reputation is that of a debauched and restless prodigy whose genius flared briefly before he turned his back on literature at the age of nineteen to wander the globe in search of mercantile success. In the handful of years during which he pro- duced his slender body of work, Rimbaud brought the rank odors of sex and the street to the pristinely elevated Parnassian tradition of French po- etry. Tales of sordid habits and defiant, épater-les-bourgeois gestures swirled around him already in his lifetime, conjuring up an image of someone who lived outside the law. It doesn't hurt his legendary status, either, that he died young and ingloriously in 1891, at the age of thirty-seven, after a team of doctors amputated his leg in an effort to stave off a raging infec- tion. (Like many other aspects of his life, the exact cause of his death, which has been attributed variously to syphilis and cancer, is the stuff of informed speculation rather than hard-and-fast facts.) Nor does it detract from his darkly glamorous aura that at various times in his vagabond existence, Rim- baud lived in what was presumed to be a homosexual liaison with the mar- ried poet and father-to-be Paul Verlaine, and worked at a variety of unsa- vory occupations, including gun runner and mercenary, in exotic and unexplored parts of the world. One wonders what this implacable misanthrope - whose hometown funeral was served by a beadle, a bell ringer, eight choirboys, and twenty orphan girls with candles, but was attended only by his mother and sister - ^^ Daphne Merkin, a writer and critic, is on the staff of The New Yorker. Her books include Dreaming of Hitler: Passions &amp; Provocations, a collection of essays, and Enchantment, a novel. 45</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR would have made of the lavish scrutiny that has been accorded his abbrevi- ated life and work. Within a day of Rimbaud's death, an edition of his poems called Le Reliquaire (to which the publisher had hastily appended a sensa- tionalist preface describing the late poet as "a brutish little vagrant who made himself at home in the murkiest parts of the human mind") was seized by the police. This was at the behest of a young journalist, Rodolphe Darzens, who had become intrigued by Rimbaud after reading an article in Verlaine 's Poètes maudits. Darzens would be the first of many to attempt to decipher the story of Rimbaud's disappearing act, so he had a vested interest in keeping other people's grubby hands off the elusive bard-cum-failed-entrepreneur whose scattered writing he had been assiduously tracking down. This cultural fixation on a laconic, not particularly likable, and antisocial figure who renounced everyone and everything, including his own talent, has endured over the years and shows no sign of abating. The most recent rip- ple in the ongoing wave of posthumous celebrity was Rimbaud's induction last spring into the Modern Library pantheon of authors. Rimbaud Complete includes fifty pages of previously untranslated material, and was edited and newly translated to a gritty rather than polished effect by Wyatt Mason, a writer who is now translating Rimbaud's complete correspondence; anyone who has managed to overlook the scatological and anal imagery on earlier readings cannot help being struck by it this time around. (The penultimate translation, by Paul Schmidt for Everyman's Library, was published in 1994; Mason commends that version for its "musical qualities" but deems it "wrong- headed.") Now Rimbaud keeps canonic company with such heavyweights as Saint Augustine and Thomas Mann - but not, curiously, with his fellow sym- bolistes, who stirred up the placid, formulaic universe of French poetry at roughly the same period. Stéphane Mallarmé, who crossed paths with Rim- baud only once and found him repugnant (he later described him as having the vast, reddened hands of a laundress), is absent from this august congre- gation, as is Charles Baudelaire, Rimbaud's confrère in self-loathing. It was Baudelaire, after all, who in Les Fleurs du mal virtually invented the notion of the poet with a terminal case of nostalgie de la boue; Baudelaire, whose ab- ject imagination and hashish-inspired visions helped inspire Rimbaud's own belief that the best writing came from, as he famously put it, "a deliberate de- rangement of the senses." Then again, these gaps in the lineup of authors who have earned the Modern Library's seal of approval are hardly conclu- sive, and one imagines that Baudelaire and Mallarmé may yet have their day. (Baudelaire's absence would doubtless have pleased Rimbaud, who was dis- inclined to admit to any literary precursors - least of all one who embraced the artistic uses of intoxication before he did.) The first definitive biography of Rimbaud, by Enid Starkie, came out in 1947, and was revised several times as new material came to light. Despite its somewhat baroque style and its impressionistic, almost free-associative mode of interpretation, Starkie's account remains perhaps the best at in- 46</page><page sequence="3">Rimbaud Rules tuitively comprehending the Inner Rimbaud. "He had never been capable, and was never to be capable," Starkie observes, "of the warm animal inti- macy of the young, their instinctive and physical intimacy, like that of kit- tens rolling together in the basket. There was much in him that could be hurt and he needed to protect his spiritual privacy from invasion." Starkie 's portrait of a wounded, brooding Rimbaud opened the gateway; following her lead, there have been four exhaustive biographies in the last twenty years alone. According to Graham Robb, whose excellent biography was published in 2000, Rimbaud scholars are producing "an annual average of ten books and eighty-seven articles." Although it has become hard to imagine Rimbaud as other than hell- bent on notoriety from the very start, his tame beginnings suggest nothing of the sort. The man whose nose-thumbing behavior scandalized even the more jaded of his Parisian contemporaries, and who continues to fascinate both highbrow and pierced-brow fans more than a century later, earned his first bit of acclaim as a star pupil - a teacher's pet and show-off who was taunted by his older schoolmates. Indeed, to judge by his student days, this self-contained boy from an inflexibly bourgeois, churchgoing background might have been more likely to become a mild-mannered schoolteacher than the patron saint of adolescent attitude - the sneering rebel who declared, "Morality is a weakness of the brain" - he came to be. Born in 1854, Rimbaud grew up in the provincial town of Charleville in the north of France. He was the second of four children. His father, a career officer who rose to the rank of captain, disappeared from sight shortly before his son turned six, never to be heard from again. (This ghostly paternal presence may help, at least in part, to shed light on the origins of his son's literary gifts, especially his encyclopedic impulse. Captain Rimbaud found time between his military duties to produce an almost-nine-hundred- page summary of Arabic grammatical rules, as well as a collection of Ara- bic jokes and a translation of the Qur'an. Graham Robb speculates that, had his works been published, "they might have earned him a serious reputa- tion as an Orientalist.") In any event, young Arthur was a solitary and dreamy child whose fingernails were kept clean and whose ears were fre- quently boxed by his penny-pinching, germ-obsessed martinet of a mother; Rimbaud would later refer to her as "la bouche d'ombre" [the mouth of dark- ness] , a name derived from the title of a Victor Hugo poem. His light blue serge trousers, like the clothes of his siblings, were made by her. He escaped from the grim atmosphere at home - Robb reports that the Rimbaud chil- dren "were said to have a slightly cretinous appearance, like beaten ani- mals" - by reading adventure stories, such as Robinson Crusoe or the novels of James Fenimore Cooper, and dreaming of the sea. The future wanderer - Rimbaud eventually alighted in thirteen coun- tries and would be the first European to settle in the "Forbidden City" of 47</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Harar, in what is now southern Ethiopia - was kept on a tight leash. There is a way in which Rimbaud's childhood might be said to resemble the closely tethered one of a true mama's boy, except that in his case Mama was one of the great antinurturers of all time, more Ma Barker than Old Mother Hubbard. What little affection did exist was, as Robb remarks, "inextrica- bly bound up with coercion." Mme Rimbaud picked her son up from school every day, the better to keep him from getting into mischief with other chil- dren, and his two sisters oversaw his homework. Noted for his eerie reserve and his disconcertingly pale blue eyes, he cut a brilliant academic swath at the two schools he attended, hauling home cartloads of prizes (including a first prize in Religious Education when he was fourteen), and astonish- ing his teachers with his intellectual aptitude. His primary engagement was with language; he warmed to the Latin hexameters of Horace and Catul- lus, and shone at French alexandrines and Greek verse as well. He de- voured Romantic literature and was particularly smitten with Victor Hugo and Baudelaire. Endowed with a remarkable memory and superb imitative skills, Rimbaud was a natural literary poacher. He could effortlessly copy the styles of other writers, both those who were worth imitating (François Vil- lon) and those who were not (Théodore de Banville, the leading Parnass- ian poet of the day). "Rimbaud," Robb observes, "was treating French po- etry as a private boudoir, dressing himself in different genres, inspecting his development in other poets' mirrors." The earliest of Rimbaud's published poems, "The Orphan's New Year's Gifts," appeared when he was sixteen, and is one of only three pieces that earned him notice in his lifetime. (The other two were "First Evening" and the prose poem "A Season in Hell," which was self-published.) The poem is soggy with a borrowed sentimentality and specious piety, both of which suggest the performing-monkey aspect of Rimbaud's talent. But it also has an immediacy of engagement and an almost physical rendering of emotion that points to the elasticity of his later poems: "The room is full of shadow; you vaguely hear / Two children whispering, sadly, softly. / Heavy with sleep, their heads are bowed / Beneath the long white curtain that trem- bles and rises. . . ." Within the next year and a half, everything would change. Somewhere along the way, through some inextricable combination of proclivity and cir- cumstance, the rejected child became father to the rejecting adolescent; the mother-dominated grind who lived in fear of getting his clothes dirty turned into a bored dropout with a taste for subversion and a vagrant's soul. Rimbaud's discontent was further fueled by his towering literary am- bition; he may have longed for the raw experience to be found in the world beyond the smug confines of Charleville, but he yearned even more for the admiration he assumed would be his once the tastemakers in Paris had read his poems. For all the misery of his childhood, it is clear that Rimbaud was possessed of that preternatural faith in his own gifts which self-styled 48</page><page sequence="5">Rimbaud Rules visionaries often have. He saw himself as destined for greatness very early on, in spite of the humiliations he suffered at home. This attitude was en- couraged by his friend Ernest Delahaye, who idolized Rimbaud and would continue to put himself at his ^service for the duration of Rimbaud's life. But by far the more important influence was that of his twenty-two-year-old teacher and long-suffering mentor at the Collège de Charleville, Georges Izambard. Recognizing that he had before him a "first-rate cerebral mechanism" in the guise of a seemingly compliant local prodigy, Izambard advised Rim- baud on his writing and lent him books from his own library. (These included Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, the discovery of which elicited a stern letter of protest from Mme Rimbaud, taking the teacher to task for allowing such a "dangerous" book to fall into "the hands of children.") Soon after, on August 31 , 1870, his mother's worst fears were realized when her sixteen-year-old son escaped to war-torn Paris, only to be thrown into a prison cell and exposed to influences far more pernicious than those to be found in a Victor Hugo novel. He was returned to his furious mother less than a month later by the devoted Izambard, but soon enough would be chafing to escape again. These changes - and whiffs of more to come - were all reflected in "Le Bateau ivre' ("The Drunken Boat"), which is often regarded as Rimbaud's signature poem, if so protean a writer can be said to have a signature. It's the work, at any rate, from which people who have read his poetry are likely to be able to recite a line or two - much like the opening of Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken." By the time this poem was written, within eighteen months of "The Orphan's New Year's Gifts," Rimbaud, not yet seventeen, was set on his future course, which was to be characterized by severed con- nections and abrupt departures. ("He was always," as Robb notes, "on his way to somewhere else.") Having already flung himself at an unwelcoming Paris three times, Rimbaud was about to descend on the post-Communard capital once again, newly fortified by a personal invitation from Verlaine, whose attention he had caught by sending him urgent dispatches of his own poetry. "Come, dear great soul," the older poet had grandly suggested. "We await you; we desire you." (The worshipful Delahaye, convinced that Rimbaud would "enter the world of letters like a bullet," had copied his pal's poems in roundhand so Verlaine would find them easier to read.) In his introduction to the Modern Library's new edition, Wyatt Mason ob- serves that "Le Bateau ivre" was a radical step forward in Rimbaud's "po- etic apprenticeship" - a process that had begun in "scrupulous imitation" and arrived with astonishing speed at a point of "utter originality." And the poem is indeed singularly modern both in the poise with which it establishes its own unfamiliar context - "The Drunken Boat" is narrated from the perspective of the boat - and in the lyric intensity of its anthropomorphic habitation. It begins without benefit of throat-clearing, immediately plunging the reader into the sensation of being adrift on a river that has taken control. (Part of 49</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Rimbaud's innovativeness is his refusal to ease the reader in by spelling out the implicit comparison between himself and the boat- - i.e., "I am like a drunken boat.") The poet's tone becomes eerily nostalgic toward the end, as though some irrevocable break with the past has already occurred: "If I still long for Europe's waters, it's only for / One cold black puddle where a child crouches / Sadly at its brink and releases a boat, / Fragile as a May butterfly, into the fragrant dusk." Perhaps Rimbaud was envisioning a future in which he had already taken leave of his vulnerable, poetry-making self and the culture that bred him. Or perhaps this tone of inexplicable regret was no more than a useful pose, one of many in his ongoing campaign to become a prophet in his own time: "I'm now making myself as scummy as I can," the eighteen-year-old Rimbaud wrote to Izambard. "Why? I want to be a poet and I'm working at turning myself into a Seer." The next year or two would be packed with more poems, more of what Robb calls "buggery business" with Verlaine, more travel, and more uneasy reunions with Mme Rimbaud. There would be drugs, seamy living, and low-level jobs, inflammatory talk in cafés and extravagant theorizing in the form of Une Saison en enfer. Rimbaud had great hopes for this book, which appeared in the fall of 1873, shortly after his nineteenth birthday. As it turned out, Une Saison en enfer was roundly ignored, and would be reviewed only after his death. (The prose-poems collected under the title Les Illumi- nations were first published, without his knowledge, in 1876 - years after Rimbaud had stopped writing, and was presumed to be dead; their au- thorship was ascribed to the late Arthur Rimbaud.) By May of 1876, Rimbaud had sworn off literature and signed on as a mercenary with the Dutch colonial army, from which he deserted in short order. He was twenty-one. His journey into self-imposed exile had begun, and would end thirteen and a half years later with a feverish letter dictated to his younger sister, Isabelle, from his deathbed in a Marseilles hospital. In the letter, Rimbaud addressed an imaginary "Directeur" describing him- self as "crippled and unhappy," and eager to pay up his "account." We are left with the impression of a man who has been rendered immobile but is compelled to keep moving, who still dreams of escaping his condition of self-confinement by sailing away over the waters. The tone is both abject and imperious: "I am completely paralyzed," Rimbaud concluded, "and so I wish to embark in good time. Tell me at what time I must be carried on board." Perhaps because there are fewer mysteries more glamorous than the mystery of renouncing great creative gifts, Arthur Rimbaud has re- tained his hold over our imagination. Most of us have little idea how to live with the selves we happen to be stuck with - much less how to go about shedding them in order to acquire new ones. People who do man- age such acts of re-invention - who appear to break the stranglehold of a given identity - acquire an almost talismanic stature. Small wonder, then, 50</page><page sequence="7">Rimbaud Rules that decade after decade Rimbaud is discovered anew as a galvanizing force by just those unsalubrious types that Mme Rimbaud so valiantly strived to keep her son clear of: those intent on changing (or at least chal- lenging) the world. Often the fascination takes a purely literary form, as in the translation Samuel Beckett made, early in his career, of "Le Bateau ivre" or the poem by Malcolm Lowry that consists entirely of a list of the many identities (tutor, beggar, quarry foreman, and more) that Rimbaud adopted in his lifetime. But an interest in Rimbaud's myth doesn't nec- essarily imply a finely tuned grasp of the nuances of his actual work. In the forties, for instance, the writer and poet Delmore Schwartz, who was given to bouts of manic enthusiasm, attempted a translation of "A Sea- son in Hell," notwithstanding his faltering grasp of French. (The critics had a field day pointing out the gaffes, which included Schwartz's rendi- tion of "je revais" as "I review.") And Rimbaud also inspired visual artists: Picasso did a sketch of him, Modigliani admired him, and the thrice-mar- ried painter Max Ernst paraphrased his views on romance - "Love, as Rimbaud said, must be reinvented" - although it is not a subject one usu- ally associates with this poet. In the fifties, the Beats- Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and the rest of the on-the-road gang - were linked to Rimbaud in what seems at first glance an obvious connection. But although the Beats trafficked in a permanent state of. transience, as he did, their laid-back style of disengagement was very different from Rimbaud's bilious outlook. In the late sixties, with rev- olution in the air, Rimbaud's cachet began to skyrocket. He was taken up by a throng of professional renegade-artists that included both Morrisons (Jim and Van) , Bob Dylan, and Patti Smith. In 1968 - at the peak of his fame and two years before his death in a Parisian bathtub - -Jim Morrison sent a fan letter to Wallace Fowlie, who had published the first translation of Rimbaud's complete works: "I am a rock singer," he wrote, "and your book travels with me everywhere." Van Morrison wrote "Tore Down a la Rim- baud," which he described as being about "artistic block and lack of in- spiration." And Bob Dylan, in 'You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go," somewhat melodramatically compared his own tattered romantic his- tory to Rimbaud's doomed relationship with Verlaine (which had crash- landed when Verlaine made several suicide attempts and then shot Rimbaud in the arm) : "Situations have ended sad, / Relationships have all been bad. / Mine've been like Verlaine and Rimbaud. . . ." Patti Smith, of course, is foremost among contemporary Rimbaud cognoscenti, having apparently channeled him in her formative youth. Already in 1973 she was writing liner notes for a friend's album in the form of a stream-of-consciousness incantation: "devotions. To Arthur Rimbaud. He was young, he was so damn young, he was so god damned. . . ." Like a cheerleader dressed in black leather, Smith growled, "Go Rimbaud Rimbaud Rimbaud," as part of the lyrics for the centerpiece track of her first album, Horses, and focused 51</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR another of her albums, Easter, entirely on the figure of the "been there, done that" poet. Closer to our own moment, Rimbaud continues to rule as the cultural referent of choice. In 1995 his affair with Verlaine was made into a film, Total Eclipse, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of the pervy poet. That spring, the journal Critical Inquiry published an article solemnly entitled "Rimbaud and Patti Smith: Style as Deviance." And in January of last year, a day-long Stanford University conference on Bob Dylan included a talk called "Visionary Road: Rimbaud, Kerouac, Dylan." (Rimbaud would surely have derived some satisfaction from having engendered enough recondite scholarship to inspire a parodie bibliography - a counterhistory of sorts - called Le Mythe de Rimbaud.) Still the question lurks: What do people talk about when they talk about Arthur Rimbaud? Is it his oblique and strangely impersonal verse that has outlived him, or is it his high-pitched but ultimately impenetrable life that casts such a long shadow? "The more perfect the artist," T. S. Eliot cate- gorically observed, "the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates." Try telling that to the hipster fans who have appropriated Rimbaud's glowering anguish, jangling around his persona like so much pocket change, and see how far you get. In the case of this artist, for better and worse, Eliot's somewhat priggish decree falls by the wayside - if only because Rimbaud's cultural presence has less to do with his stylistic influence and more to do with his embodiment of a particular artistic stance. And although each generation likes to discover the politics of subversion for itself, with him the Bad Boy came of age, thumbing his nose at the establishment not because he was an angry bumpkin but be- cause he had seen into its corrupt and unknowing depths and had rendered his verdict: he didn't want any part of it. "One must be absolutely modern," Rimbaud declared, and promptly went on to be absolutely modern from the moment he died (just as Eliot was old-fashioned from the day he was born) . There was more than a bit of the poseur in him, but there was also the unarguable talent. As one of his peers indelicately put it: "He stank of genius." Perhaps the most poignant irony of the Rimbaud saga is that, for all the great distance he traveled, he wasn't able to leave home. He never really gave up on his unyielding mother, never stopped looking to hereto bail him out of fixes or to offer a liberating glimpse of affection and concern - the "warm maternal gaze" he wistfully invoked in "The Orphan's New Year's Gift." It may well be that his defiance was just another form of attachment, his being a poet a phase he had to go through before settling down to embrace his mother's bourgeois convictions that money counted for everything and that loftier pursuits were to be snubbed. "One can never leave," Rimbaud wrote in Une Saison en enfer. He passed this confession off as an aside, but in a life full of secrets, this may have been the best-kept of all.
