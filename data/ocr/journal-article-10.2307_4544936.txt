<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII*-GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY by Stewart R. Sutherland In this paper I propose to examine three different accounts of what it means to talk of God as eternal. Probably the most gener- ally understood sense in which God is believed to be eternal is that of timelessness, as expounded for example by Boethius and Aquinas. An alternative view on the matter is to be found in Nelson Pike's God and Timelessness' and in Richard Swinburne's The Coherence of Theism.! Swinburne argues explicitly, and Pike implicitly, that talk of the eternity of God is better understood as talk of the everlastingness (or, as others prefer it, the sempiternity) of God. My argument is that difficulties arise in the published presentations of both of these accounts of the eternity of God. The final section of the paper will outline a third possible account of this belief which, if intelligible, will preserve some at least of the content of what the belief is often taken to be, but which will certainly exclude many of the claims regarded as true by Aquinas, as well as most of those whose mutual coherence is defended by Swinburne. I The classical definition of the eternity of God is found in Boe- thius: Eternity is the complete possession of eternal life all at once (tota simu). As part of my consideration of this account of God as eternal, I shall assume that to call someone or something timeless is to talk of what lacks both temporal location and temporal duration. The attractions of this view undoubtedly relate to the idea of God as immutable, and thus not dependent upon anything else for the manner of his existence. Theologians, however, have generally wished to add both omniscience and omnipotence to the attri- butes of such a timeless God. My own view is that despite the in- genuity expended in showing the compatibility of these claims, * Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 5/7 Tavistock Place, London WC i on Monday 22 January 1979 at 7.30 p.m.</page><page sequence="2">104 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND the attempt will always fail, and I shall briefly outline my rea- sons for accepting this conclusion. It has been argued that if God is timeless then he cannot be omniscient, for there are many important truths which a timeless being cannot know. Most crucially (as Prior has argued) a time- less being's knowledge would be restricted "to those truths, if any, which are themselves tenseless".3 That is to say, such a God could not know what is happening now, nor what will happen tomorrow, nor what happened yesterday. If such a claim is true, then it would seem to eliminate the idea of God's foreknowledge, and this will have the advantage that it avoids at least some of the difficulties of the compatibility of belief in God, and belief that in some sense at least the future actions of human beings are free. The cost of this is the claim that God is omniscient. In an interesting contribution to this debate, Paul Helm has argued that it is not incoherent to claim that a timeless knower could be said to foreknow a particular action or event: What I wish to claim is that in these circumstances the con- cept of foreknowledge applies not to a timeless knower's knowl- edge of certain events or actions, but to a temporal agent's recognition of timeless knowledge.' The implication of this is that whereas it would not be intelligible for a timeless knower to claim "I foreknow that A", where A is an event or action, it is intelligible for a temporal being to say of a timeless knower "He foreknows that A". Helm suggests the fol- lowing paraphrase: (i) At a time before this time (the time of (i)'s utterance) the statement 'T timelessly knows A' (where T refers to the timeless knower, and A is an event future to the time of the statement's utterance) is true. Within the terms of the discussion upon which he is engaged, i.e. whether a timeless knower's knowledge could be reasonably spoken of by a temporal being as foreknowledge, Helm's account seems to me to be legitimate. The cost in this case, however, is that all the difficulties in reconciling God's foreknowledge and human freedom reassert themselves. There have been a number of attempts to reconcile these, but to pursue them at the moment: would be a diversion.</page><page sequence="3">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY I05 The two possibilities outlined above are either that we accept that there are considerable limitations to be set to the truths which a timeless knower may be said to know, but thereby allow at least the possibility of human freedom, or that we accept an account such as Helm's, and with it the possible consequence that a timeless knower could know now el, where e, is whether I shall leave the house before or after 8.I5 tomorrow morning. That is to say, the concept of an omniscient timeless God is not without its problems. These problems, however, are as I shall show in due course, rather deeper than has been acknowledged so far in this discussion. They concern what it could mean for a timeless being to know anything, let alone to know everything. From this follows an even broader question of what relationship an eternal (timeless) God could have to history. This issue may helpfully be approached by considering whether a timeless God might be omnipotent. Would any limitations be set to the kinds of things which God might be capable of doing, specifically because he is regarded as being timeless? The limita- tions seem to me to be very considerable indeed. If God is timeless then it is difficult to see how he could effect changes within the temporal order. This seems to apply equally to events within creation, as well as to the event (if it is one) of Creation. In order to affect, even by initiating it, what happens in a time sequence (history) it would seem that one must be or become, if not part of it in the sense of temporally extended, at least locatable within it. I am not here making the point that the individuation of events is only possible if they are conceived as belonging to a single time-series: discussion of this issue will follow in due course. The point here is that if an event which is part of the time-series to which we belong, i.e. is part of our his- tory, then if that event is to be explained as an act, then whether the agent be Endersby the post-office clerk, or God, prima facie that agent must be locatable within that time series. It is a legiti- mate step to point out that being capable of acting in history pre- supposes being locatable within the time-series of history. The definition of timelessness with which we are working excludes temporal location; and is therefore one which excludes the possi.- bility of being in the type of connection with events necessary for being regarded as bringing them to be. The same point applies to the theological idea that God preserves the various states of affairs which constitute creation.</page><page sequence="4">i o6 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND One possible modification of the conclusion that a timeless God cannot bring about changes within history is to be found in the suggestion that the idea of God might move believers to act in specific ways and that therefore there is an extended sense in which a timeless God can affect the course of history. This would of course, still limit God's activity considerably and would cer- tainly rule out traditional notions of omnipotence. It could also be protested that it is not God who brings about change, but only the idea, or possibly contemplation or awareness of God, which affects the course of history. This would be unduly fastidious, however, for it does seem quite conceivable that one might truth- fully say that the beauty of the valley was a major factor in the defeat of the planning application, or-an example relevant to the final section of the paper-that the demands of justice settled the issue, without acknowledging the necessity of rephrasing these in some such terms as "the chairman's sense of . . .". Even so, the idea of the timelessness of God does seem incompatible with traditional notions of omnipotence, and in so doing does set further constraints to possible answers to the broader question of the relation of a timeless God to history. As can be inferred from these brief discussions of omniscience and omnipotence, some of the major problems arising from belief in an eternal, in the sense of timeless, God arise when we attempt to attribute to such a God the characteristics or activities of a person. In talking of "persons" I am not wanting to enter the maze of Trinitarian theology. Rather the issue is whether or not timeless existence is a conceivable form of existence for a person, or even a being. The problem can be exemplified by quoting a passing comment from Paul Helm's paper. In dismissing the pos- sibility of a trivial objection to his way of phrasing a point, Helm adds (Nothing, of course, hangs on the utterance of 'I foreknow A' and it may be thought artificial to suppose that a time- less knower could utter anything. If so we can substitute 'truly represent to himself that', for 'utter' or 'state'). (p. 525) The implied difficulty is, of course, that "uttering" is most ob- viously understood as the action of a corporeal being, requiring vocal chords, lips, tongue and so on. Helm avoids the obvious</page><page sequence="5">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY 107 ways out of the difficulty of what can be meant here, and rather than simply stating that the notion is to be understood analogic- ally or symbolically, he eliminates the first order spatial refer- ences by rephrasing "utter" as "truly represents to himself". Certainly this removes the discomfort of the spatial connota- tions of "utter", but it fails to recognise the more radical implica- tions of talking of a timeless being. The point here is that we are not constrained simply to limit ourselves to the notion of a non- corporeal action, but rather we are in pursuit of the wild goose of a non-tensed action, one that does not involve the possibility of temporal co-ordinates being given to it. Such is inconceivable. Actions essentially belong to time. They involve change, and as such are receptive of being located in a time series (indeed, I should argue, if they are real rather than fictitious, in the time series of which our lives are part). Here we arrive at the heart of the limitations which the concept of timelessness, as it is under- stood by the writers to whom we have already referred, imposes upon the idea of God. It excludes the possibility of action, not just corporeal action, but any action. Thus such a God is not simply not active in history: he is not active at all. The implications for theism and religious belief are far reaching. A timeless being cannot utter, but neither can he represent to himself. He cannot physically make or create, but neither can he deliberate, reflect, anticipate or intend, for these are all essentially temporal notions implying both duration and temporal location. He cannot, of course, remember or predict, suspect or confirm; nor is it easy to grasp what timeless love really can be. The question which inevitably arises concerns what sense, if any, could be attached to the claim that a God who can- not do any of these could be regarded as a person, or even as "personal". The corollary relates to whether or not such a God would meet the needs of religion. The conclusion which I draw from this discussion of the ac- count of the eternity of God as the timelessness of God is that whatever the religious attractions of the idea, it cannot be com- bined with belief in an omnipotent, omniscient, active God. II For reasons of the sort discovered in the previous section of this paper, a number of philosophers and theologians have either</page><page sequence="6">I o8 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND severely modified or actually rejected the doctrine of the time- lessness of God. One of the most recent and interesting attempts to give an account of belief in God as a temporal being is to be found in Richard Swinburne's book The Coherence of Theism. There it is argued both explicitly and plicitly that properly understood, a coherent account of belief in God preserving at least something of the belief in God's omniscience, his omnipo- tence, and the type of activity compatible with talking of God as a personal ground of being, can be given if God is understood as a temporal being. If this is so, then considerable intellectual advantage will be found in preferring the view that God is tem- poral to the belief in his timelessness. I propose to argue that the gain is more apparent than real, and I shall do so by considering the content, according to this view, which can be given to the ideas of God knowing and of God acting. In the matter of God's omniscience, certain points are not dis- puted by Swinburne. For example, he would not disagree with Helm's conclusion that if God is correctly believed to have fore- knowledge of human actions, then that would limit, or remove completely, any possibility of human freedom. Swinburne's solu- tion is to propose a modified account of omniscience which ex- cludes future free actions from the range of what may be known: A person P is omniscient at a time t if and only if he knows of every true proposition about t or an earlier time that it is true and also he knows of every true proposition about a time later than t, such that what it reports is physic- ally necessitated by some cause at t or earlier that it is true. (p. 175). Initially it is important to note that the omniscience of such a God is considerably less than Swinburne explicitly acknowledges. It may seem that to grant even modified omniscience (the know- ledge of all events which are "physically necessitated by some cause") is to grant a great deal. If one is a determinist, that, of course, allows knowledge of all events; but if, as Swinburne hints, a belief in free human action which is not either trivial or com- patible with determinism is legitimate, then a consequence of this is that what God knows about the future will progressively dimin- ish as human technology increases. For example, on this proviso, ever since human beings have been in a position to land any</page><page sequence="7">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY IO9 form of projectile on the surface of the moon, God cannot, on Swinburne's definition, have had any future knowledge of the state of the surface of the moon. Indeed since it is conceivable that human beings might have developed the technology to do this much earlier than they did, then God could not have been in a position to make many knowledge claims about the future at all. Claims about Haley's comet might still be safe from the con- tamination or interference of human technology, but it could be simply a matter of time till someone harnesses its advertising capacity by introducing colours or form into its "tail". It is not necessary to spell out in any further detail just how widespread the influence of one free human act can be in limiting the know- ledge of such a God. for the restrictions which this view places on God's omniiscience extend far beyond the generally trivial example of his knowledge of the surface of the moon. Even more basic, however, is the difficulty of giving a clear account of what the knowledge of an omniscient temporal being could be like, even if one were to argue that included in such knowledge is knowledge of human actions. The difficulty may be put in this way: when we talk of the knowledge which we tem- poral human beings have, there is a whole series of connections and distinctions which we make and which are built into the tex- ture of our life and language. In the view being examined, that belief in an omniscient temporal being is coherent, many of these connections have been cut. Some of these have been severed by postulating a non-spatial being, and some by postulating an omniscient being who is nonetheless temporal. In order to deal adequately with the former I should have to divert the discus- sion away from temporality to a consideration of Swinburne's arguments concerning the possibility of giving an account of per- sonal identity over time which does not presuppose bodily con- tinuity. Since I have some sympathy with the points being made by Swinbume in this section of his book,5 and since also it would involve a substantial digress from an initial concern with tempor- ality, I shall restrict myself as far as possible to issues arising from the speculation that God is a temporal being. As is clear from mqch contemporary philosophical writing on this subject, including Swinburne's book, worries about the coherence of belief in the omniscience of God have focussed pri- marily on the idea of foreknowledge, and to a lesser extent on</page><page sequence="8">I 10 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND knowledge expressed in propositions of the form "I am now turn- ing into the South Circular". There has been a comparative dearth of discussion of what it would be for a temporal omnis- cient knower to have knowledge of the past. Attention to this issue can help throw into relief some of the difficulties inherent in the discussion of omniscience. For all temporal knowers there has to be a distinction, not simply between past, present and future, but also between knowl- edge of what is past, what is present and what is future, and in this part of the discussion I wish to restrict myself to cases of knowledge that, e.g., (i) there was a rainstonn in Edinburgh on i6th September I978; (ii) there is not a rainstorm in Edinburgh now; and (iii) there will not be a rainstorm in Edinburgh tomor- row. Assume that each of these true claims is made on igth Sep- tember 1978, and that in each case adequate evidence of the truth of these claims is available to the person making the claims. For human beings, the grounds for (i) and (ii) could be of two different sorts: on the one hand they might be present in Edin- burgh on the day in question and be aware of the heavy rain falling; or on the other they might base their knowledge on reliable reports. In the case of God, such knowledge is not gener- ally presumed to be based upon a celestial intelligence agency, therefore it would seem that if as Swinburne intends we are to make any sense of the claim that he knows these truths, we shall have to do so in terms of a picture of God somehow being aware, i.e. in terms of knowledge by acquaintance rather than descrip- tion. Although this is already beginning to call to mind the type of trap set by Philo for Cleanthes when he encouraged his postu- lations with his "Add, a mind like the human",' let us persevere to see where the picture of an omniscient temporal knower leads. Leaving aside the fact that God is not a spatial being, we may find, even in his proposed temporality, considerable difficulties. As a temporal being God must clearly be in a position to distin- guish between remembering what has happened, and being aware of what is happening. Yet, granted also that it is proposed that he is omniscient, what account could be given of this? In the case of human beings there are two general ways in which we might point to the distinction between remembering an event and being aware of an event. One such way is degree of certain- ty: aware of our own fallibility in both contexts, it just is the case,</page><page sequence="9">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY I I I and reasonably so, that we are prepared to attach a greater degree of certainty to our knowledge claims about what we are attending to now, than to our knowledge claims about what we were attending to yesterday. Other factors being equal, the past- ness of X is an additional potential source of our being in error about X. Clearly in the case of an omniscient temporal knower, such an element would not be present as one of the marks of dis- tinction between remembering and being aware. A second way in which we might try to give some account of the difference between claims based on remembering and claims based on being aware, would be in terms of the checks which we might carry out in providing justification for such claims. In the case of what we claim about what we are now aware of, the checks might consist of looking more closely, pinching ourselves to see if we are awake, asking anyone else who happens to be there what they thought etc. In the end however, claiming to know would involve being directly aware in a particular way modified perhaps by these checks. In this case the postulated om- niscient being would not have to undertake equivalent bodily or perspectival checks; but in essence his knowledge too would in- volve being directly aware. (Indeed it is difficult to avoid the con- clusion that it would simply be, being directly aware.) In the case of remembering what has happened however, there is a marked divergence. For human beings there is a series of checks available in principle, and in the absence of which we should not be in- clined to talk of knowledge (nor, if we regard it as an achieve- ment verb, of 'remembering'). These checks all involve appeal to what we are aware of now, including the reports of others, rec- ords at the weather office, the state of one's roses etc.; and one important feature here is that we may not, and indeed in some cases could not have been aware of this evidence when, e.g., the rain was falling in Edinburgh. In the case of a postulated omniscient God, as we have seen, such appeal to indirect evidence is excluded. There are no equiva- lent checks. In his case his remembering that it rained in Edin- burgh on September i6th last is not differentiated from his awareness of the rainstorm on i 6th September last by requiring supplementation from other sources in order to become the basis for a knowledge claim. In other words, in certain contexts, and concerning certain sorts of knowledge, human beings draw a clear</page><page sequence="10">I 12 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND distinction between remembering and being aware, in the way in which appeal to other sources or not as the case may be, is re- garded as important. In the case of our omniscient temporal knower, however, no such appeal is relevant. In his case, if the notion of a check on knowledge of past events is to have any sig- nificance at all, it could only be in terms of the awareness one had being without fault. That could only be done by "regenerating" the awareness, and checking the details of one's awareness. The problem then is this: how could God distinguish between remembering an event X, and being aware of an event X? If, to put it colloquiaRly, God has "twenty-twenty" recall, what account can we give of the difference between God remembering and God being aware. If, as is being postulated, God's knowledge is imme- diate in the sense of not even being mediated through sense or- gans, and if also it is direct in the sense of by acquaintance rather than by description, is there anything in the manner or content of being aware which could differentiate for such a knower be- tween rehearsing or recalling the past, and being aware of the continuing present? It will not do of course simply to claim that somehow the difference is in the content of what one is aware of, the present being the present and therefore actual, the past being the past and therefore in a parallel sense no longer actual. As in a different context Berkeley was well aware, to distinguish be- tween what can only be called two sets of "awarenesses" it is not sufficient simply to classify one set as actual and one as non- actual: one has to give the criteria according to which such dis- tinctions are made. Berkeley's difficulties, although derived from accounting for human mental activity, are instructive, as is his failure to overcome them. On the one hand one attempt which he made was to offer criteria such as strength, distinctness, order- liness, and coherence. Now criteria such as these are ruled out by the nature of the case; for, on the one hand, the remembered events are known to have taken place and are therefore neither more nor less orderly and coherent than events known to be tak- ing place. On the other hand the lack of strength and distinctness in our memories could only be a sign of the weakness and falli- bility of finite beings. Alternatively, his further attempt to ac- count for the distinction involved positing a God of the type whose very coherence is at the moment under discussion. He did realise,</page><page sequence="11">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY 113 however, that it is not satisfactory to distinguish awareness of the actual from awareness of the non-actual simply in terms of the distinction between what is present and what is absent; for that itself is a problematic distinction. The conclusion of this argument rests on the fact that an omniscient temporal being must have knowledge of both past and present events. Unless such an omniscient temporal being is content simply to equate what has happened with what seems to him to have happened-and that would be unacceptable for a variety of reasons-then, in principle, some checks must be pos- sible. If his knowledge is immediate and direct, then checking procedures can only involve scrutinising what I have referred to as his "awareness of the past event" and his "awareness of the present event". If both "awarenesses" amount to knowledge, as I have suggested that they do, then the usual criteria which can be used to distinguish awareness of the past from awareness of the present will not apply. What sense then can be made of such a distinction? Siguificantly, for all their other weaknesses, accounts of the knowledge which a timeless knower has of past, present and future, embodied in talk of "tota simul", at least recognises this difficulty. There are of course many other ways in which accounts of be- lief in God, understood as belief in an omniscient temporal knower, can be challenged. My intention in this section of the paper has been to show that, even granted a series of presupposi- tions about how to approach these questions, unresolved diffi- culties remain. With appropriate modifications, similar problems could be uncovered about distinguishing between an omniscient temporal knower's awareness of the present, and his knowing re- lationship to the future. It might nonetheless be argued that the belief that God is a temporal rather than timeless being has the considerable advan- tage that at least a temporal being can be conceived of as acting. My argument will be that this supposition holds only if we ignore the subtle damage done to the concept of an action by assuming that the temporal being in question is also omnipotent. Swin- burne spells out the implications of such an assumption, and in so doing specifies three different types of action which may be attributed to such a God:</page><page sequence="12">114 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND The theist claims that God brings about some things him- self and makes (i.e. brings it about that) other beings bring about other things, and permits other beings to bring about yet other things. (p. 139) I shall comment on each briefly and then raise a general question about the sense of the term "action" being used here. As an example of the first type of action (which otherwise we might prima facie imagine to be typical of human action), Swin- burne suggests "creating the universe e nihilo". This is indeed an exceedingly high standard to set for "bringing about some things himself", and Swinburne agrees that human beings do not have the power to do this. In a very puzzling use of the word "pic- ture", he suggests that it is, however, fairly easy to picture what it would be like for them to have such a power. If I could just by so choos- ing produce a sixth finger or a new fountain-pen (not made out of pre-existing matter) I would have the power to bring matter into existence. (ibid.) It is difficult to see what the point, or indeed sense, of this ex- ample is. It cannot surely be intended as a help to "picturing" what God's activity is like, for if it is difficult to picture him creating e nihilo, it is not obvious that it will be easier to picture the manging director of Parker Pens, or the shop steward at Brit- ish Leyland, doing so. The point here is that the invitation of "picture" in this context is by no means easily interpreted, and could simply amount to the invitation to image a series of tem- porally connected, but otherwise apparently disjointed, scenes. The second type of action attributed to God is, however, more central to the present discussion. According to Swinburne's ac- count this seems to be at the heart of God's present relationship to his creation. God brings about "the operation of natural laws". This is a version of the traditional claim that God continues to hold the universe in existence "by making its past states bring about subsequent states". This is a very far-reaching conception, and when Swinburne argues that things have the effects in accord with natural laws which they do is, for the theist, itself an act of God (p. I40)</page><page sequence="13">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY I 15 he comes very near to saying that everything that happens either is an act of God, or that it requires an act of God as a condition of its happening. (The one possible exception would be that for a mind-body dualist it is perhaps conceivable that there might be a sub-class of human acts-thinking, imaging, etc.-which did not in any straightforward sense require the operation of natural laws.) The point of the distinction here is that whereas Swinburne seems to limit the activity of God to bringing about the effects of, e.g., turning the ignition-key, the very act of turning the ignition- key itself requires the operation of natural laws which connect the movements of nerve-endings, bone, muscle and so on. This becomes particularly important as we note further types of action attributed to God: "(God) 'permits' or 'allows' an agent Q to bring about S if he brings it about that nothing stops Q from bringing about S." (ibid.) The distinction between what God actively brings to be and what he permits has been a very important one in the history of theol- ogy, not least in so far as it has been related to the distinction between what God intends and approves on the one hand, and what he simply permits on the other. It is of significance in the discussion of the problems of evil and suffering. What Swin- burne's account achieves, however, is an erosion of the distinc- tion. If God permits one man to kill another (Swinburne's ex- ample), this is not a lack of activity on God's part; for according to Swinburne God must bring it about, not simply that the nat- ural laws necessary for connecting intention to the physical move- ment which causes the death, as well as for connecting pressure of fingers and asphyxiation, are not impeded, but in fact that each step in the process continues according to plan. In any court of law, morally imperfect though it be, a much lesser degree of co-operation would constitute grounds for conviction as an ac- complice; and many a war criminal has been found guilty of being implicated at a much greater distance than that, in the death of others. The sang-froid implicit in such a conception of God is morally grotesque. The general point which I wish to make about acts of God is that they are incredibly difficult to individuate. Certainly there are problems about the individuation of human actions; but on the</page><page sequence="14">I I6 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND -whole it would not be regarded as controversial to claim that of the events which do take or which have taken place, there are some which are clearly not my actions, or consequences of my actions. The nature of the limitation implicit in this should not however be obscured by the truth that my power and capabilities are limited. Certainly that sets limits to what I can do, but the point at issue is not one of individual capacities: it is rather one of what it is that is legitimately characterised as "an act of ..... " My argument is that amongst other conditions which apply, one very basic one is that we may individuate this act of President Carter both from the acts of other agents and also from Carter's other acts. Now the ties which bind this area of history to Presi- dent Carter in such a way as to legitimate the description "Presi- dent Carter invited the President of Egypt to Camp David" are very complex indeed; but the assumption implicit in attempting to clarify what these ties are, is that there should be a unique relationship between Carter and this area of his and our history. Thus for example, the relationship which Carter has to that area of his history which we describe as "inviting the President of Egypt to Camp David" is quite distinct from the relationship which he has to that area of his history which we describe as "inviting the Prime Minister of Israel to Camp David". Amongst other things, standard cases of the ascription of actions to Presi- dent Carter, or to anyone else, assume at a very basic level notions such as "being aware of", "paying attention to", and so on. Without being able to tie even very general descriptions such as this to areas of President Carter's experience, it is difficult to see what could be meant by attributing actions to him. It is true that there are non-standard cases of attributing actions to someone such that we say, "He wandered through the city without paying attention to where he was going", or-a different type of case- "She was unaware of the effect she was creating". I should want to stress however that these are non-standard or derivative cases whose treatment will to some extent depend upon the account given of standard examples of the attribution of actions. Consider now the case of proposed acts of an omnipotent tem- poral being responsible for the range of acts specified by Swim- burne. At this moment I can hear clocks ticking, birds whistling, a car engine being turned over, heavy traffic in the distance, leaves (several hundred) rustling in the breeze: I am engaged in</page><page sequence="15">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY I 17 the series of movements involved in writing; someone outside is sweeping the pavement; and doubtless several thousand million other human beings are engaged upon this or that activity. Now as we have seen, in each individual case myriad "acts of God" are required. There is no sense in which such an omnipotent tem- poral being can be described as having a unique relationship ta the area of history-his and ours-concerned. There comes a point where the sheer volume of "God's activity" so detaches the idea of "an act" even from basic notions such as "awareness" and "attention", that the attempt to understand how the other more complex elements of the concept of action apply to "an act of God" becomes a task which has no shape. A rather different way of approaching these problems would simply be to ask in terms of one current theological fashion, what "model" we are to adopt in discussing the activity of such a God. The frenzy implicit in the anthropomorphic picture which emerges is sufficient itself to bring about a case of theological dizziness. Perhaps it is through some such experience as this that religious thinkers of different periods have been led respec- tively to explore deism and process philosophy. In summary, I have examined the proposal that God's eternity, thought of as sempiternity, is more tolerant of the ideas of know- ing and acting which seem to be required by the belief in the omniscience and omnipotence of God. My conclusion however is that the tolerance is at best prima facie, and that thus used, the concepts of knowing and acting become detached from the series of distinctions and connections which give them the sense that they have. Thus the eternity of God understood as the sempiter- nity of an omniscient, omnipotent being is neither philosophic- ally clearer nor religiously more adequate than the proposed alternative of a timeless knowing agent. III You know, if a lot of cures are suggested for a disease, it means that the disease is incurable ... The Cherry Orchard Despite Chekhov's warning I propose to conclude by sketching an alternative account of what it means to talk of "the eternity</page><page sequence="16">I I8 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND of God". This account will depend upon finding ethical signifi- cance in the idea. It represents one way of quarrying the con- cept of an eternal, in the sense of timeless, God but it does so without the incoherence of trying to reconcile such a view with the belief in God as an agent. Nor, alternatively, will we find our- selves retreading the path followed by proposals for a sempiternal omniscient, omnipotent, anthropomorphic God. It should be acknowledged at the outset that no suggestion is made that this account represents what "the woman in pew" would claim to believe, or really believe: it does however represent one exceed- ingly important strand in religious belief, to be found certainly, but not exclusively, within Christianity.7 Some of those who talk of eternity, and of the eternity of God, are simultaneously trying to express, and also re-affirm, the possi- bility of a particular ethical outlook. The outlook, and what for want of a better expression one might call the state of soul which goes with it, are formed under the pressure of two different types of demand: on the one hand there are the demands of an ethical perspective on the idiosyncrasies and contingencies of historical existence; on the other hand there is the demand for some ontol- ogical priority to be given to this perspective, an insistence that is, that the perspective is not itself simply another arbitrary mask which is briefly donned by the actors who happen now to be crossing the stage of history. The mark of such a state of soul is initially an awareness of the constrictions which the finitude of temporality place upon us. Edwin Muir gave form to some of the elements of this in his Variations on a Time Theme: Ransomed from darkness and released in Time, Caught, pinioned, blinded, sealed and cased in Time. (from Section VII) Although there is here a reaction to mortality, the protest is not against our threescore and ten, but against the ways in which our threescore and ten itself is dominated by temporal concerns. Muir argues that unless there is the possibility of escape from time, then Imprisonment's for ever; we're the mock of Time, While lost and empty lies Eternity.</page><page sequence="17">GOD, TIME AND ETERNITY II9 The escape of which he talks in this poem, is escape within our present life rather than after it; and the possibility of escape is mooted in the lines, Or so I dream, when at my door I hear my Soul, my Visitor. He comes but seldom and I cannot tell, If he's myself or one that loves me well. (IX) To understand these images ethically is to see an ethical content in talk of eternity and of the eternity of God.8 The constraints of time which are of an ethical nature, are those which so limit our outlook that any action which we under- take will pale into insignificance when viewed in the context of the all-consuming "mountainous flame of Time". That is the ex- treme of an outlook which always locates the point of action in the future, and for which moral activity is intelligible only as seeking a purpose which is distinct from the activity itself.9 On such a view the implicit temporal gap between action and goal or fulfilment, inevitably and always allows the possibility that the point of the action may be lost; that is to say that an action whose significance resides in achieving a temporally future goal has given a hostage to fortune. Awareness of this point is one of the origins of Kant's notorious "moral argument". Whatever its de- fects as an argument however, Kant's suspicion that human be- ings could not tolerate a view of action which locates moral sig- nificance in effort rather than fulfilment, is surely well-founded. Nonetheless Kant did not give sufficient weight to the possibility that some actions do not depend upon future outcome, in so far as they are not subject to trivialisation by changing circum- stances. In such cases, whatever happens, the right thing has been done: the demands of justice or integrity or truth have been met. Clearly not all actions are of this sort; nor indeed are all morally significant. But some are and these include some which have been taken to have particular potency to inspire or even define ethical outlooks: examples here include the ways in which groups of fol- lowers have variously understood the death of Socrates, or the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Thus interpreted, these actions have an independence of time. The independence is however ethical, for it is the ethical charac- ter of the submissions in question which cannot be changed by</page><page sequence="18">120 STEWART R. SUTHERLAND what comes after. Many other types of significance which they may otherwise be thought to have are certainly historically vul- nerable. It is quite conceivable, for example, that the deaths in question might make no impact on others; but of course the ethical significance of what Socrates did in drinking the hem- lock does not depend upon Plato drawing it to the attention of later generations. In ethical terms we are talking of what has eternal significance, but by that we do not mean everlasting or unending significance. Within religious belief talk of the eternity of God has been one way of trying to articulate and define such an outlook. In this context there is believed to be further significance or gain in this way of talking. One of the fears which may be encour- aged by the pressures of friend and foe alike, is the anxiety that a decision which exhibits such an outlook may be a decision ex- hibiting the obsessive fantasies of a solitary mind. Fantasies of course may also come from without, as is well marked in Muir's uncertainty of the idea of "my soul, My Visitor", who may be a manifestation of the self, or who may be a voice from without. In either case, the expression "the eternity of God" can recognise and mark that anxiety by pointing to the ideal of a non-tempor- ally conditioned perspective, and thus can delineate further the nature of human finitude and, in Muir's sense, of the bondage of time. In addition however to marking the anxiety, it is also an affirmation of the priority given to this outlook in matters of decision, action, and belief, even if it has to be thus formulated in words unde.r strain and tension. What this expression cannot achieve, and what would amount to overworking the expression to the point of collapse, is the con- clusion that by using it, one can give a guarantee of either onto- logical priority or objectivity to this outlook. The most that it can achieve, and this is what the language of religion sometimes does more powerfully than its alternatives, is to mark and define a particularly impressive conjunction of belief and action.
