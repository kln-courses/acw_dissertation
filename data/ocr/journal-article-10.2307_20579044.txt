<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENLIGHTENED AMATEUR Texts and Pretexts: An Anthology with Commentaries, by Aldous Huxley. Harper &amp; Bros. Aldous Huxley, once the darling of the young, has, of late years, aroused resentment in the breasts of many of his contemporaries. T. S. Eliot mentions him and Bertrand Russell in the same breath; to Eliot these two are a "pair of depressing life-forcers." Huxley comes in for the parenthetical limiting sentence: Not that Mr. Huxley, who has no philosophy that I can discover, and who succeeds to some extent in elucidating how sordid a world without philosophy can be, has much in common with Mr. Russell. To followers of Middleton Murry, to neo-Marxians at large, to god-seekers in general, Mr. Huxley has become [ I70 ]</page><page sequence="2">The Enlightened Amateur anti-christ in little. He has not pretentiously advocated, or humbly bent the knee, to any current dogma. He has espoused the cause of but one contemporary writer: D. H. Lawrence. The battles joined over Joyce, Stein, and Proust have left him practically unmoved. The one con temporary English man of letters mentioned in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, he has made little capital out of this distinction. Standing well within the barrier which separates the English gentleman from the rest of the world, he has not hesitated to pillory his own class along with the international "good-timers" who crowd Mediter ranean beaches, the disciples of "the higher unlearning" who think science an end and not a means, and other doltish phenomena of our times. He terms himself a non classical naturalistic writer; he once said of his esthetic: I have a taste for the lively, the mixed, and the incomplete in art, pre ferring it to the universal and the chemically pure. Texts and Pretexts is, then, not an anthology compiled by a man of party, a man of religion, or a philosopher. Mr. Huxley puts the question in his introduction: What is the modern Ideal Man? Not the eighteenth-century Rationalist; the seventeenth-century Christian Stoic, the Free Individual of the Renaissance, the mediaeval Con templative Saint. "Nobody knows," says Mr. Huxley. And nobody, I suspect, will know until such time as a major poet appears upon the scene with the unmistakeable revelation. Meanwhile one must be content to go on piping up for reason and realism and a certain decency. [ '7I 1</page><page sequence="3">POETRY: 4 Magazine of Verse One must, in other words, do one's best as an enlightened amateur of life, literature, and art. With that lack of self consciousness characteristic of the true amateur, Mr. Huxley chooses from literature "broken and half-forgotten fragments" and sets about "fitting them into their appropriate places in the jumbled mosaic of contemporary experience." He has far less taste for the lively, the mixed, and the incomplete than he himself would admit. The writers who appear most often in these pages are Herbert, Baudelaire, Arnold, Blake, Hopkins, Vaughan, Marvell, and Shelley. He comes out flatly, in an essay on Poetry and Music, for Mozart, as against all composers before or since-Mozart who was lively but certainly not mixed. Mr. Huxley's values are sometimes strangely off-center: to him, Herbert is the poet "of the climate of the mind," as opposed to the passionate Anglican touched with a genius for God. Wordsworth is taken to task for his anthropomorphic view of nature; Whitman and Leigh Hunt are quoted on that "world below the brine" anti pathetic to man. And A. Huxley, the disabused amateur, can elsewhere appreciate mystic experience without lend ing more than an edge of his consciousness to the mystic spell. In fact, throughout essays with poetic illustrations on The Individual, Man and Nature, The Earthly Paradise and Man and Behemoth, we are continually persuaded of Mr. Huxley's good sense. Then, without warning, he makes [1 72 ]</page><page sequence="4">The Enlightened Amateur an abrupt about-face. What can good sense, what could the sensible MoliUre, make of Baudelaire's "affreuse juive" ? But we are soon back in the realm of reason, even though we may be subjected to continuous slight shocks of surprise. "The expense of spirit in a waste of shame" is separated only by a paragraph from Piccarda's speech in Paradise; George Herbert's yordan (lacking its last stanza) clears up for us the problem of obscurity in poetry; we learn the opinions of Shelley, Milton, and Blake on polyg amy, and Mr. Huxley reasonably remarks, under the heading Amor Fati: Man is so intelligent that he feels impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic. Later he backs up his case with Rochester's "Reason an ignisfaluus in the mind." Unfixed, biased only toward common sense, the amateur thus ranges through poetry in several tongues, and we follow him, on the whole, with tolerance and pleasure. For he has sought out, with charming taste and discretion, sometimes with passionate rational belief, sometimes with touching irrational enthusiasm, the pattern of life as he sees it. His ultimate cry is that life is an art, and to be lived. We realize that this creed also satisfies a Noel Coward; Mr. Huxley, however, puts it to uses that the not too pedantic reader may well consider integrated and mature.
