<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENIGMA OF JOB MAIMONIDES AND THE MODERNS H. JOEL LAKS FLUSHING, NEW YORK I T HE literature surrounding the epic of Job is a vast one. In this article I shall endeavor to provide a logical schema for relating modern interpretations of this work with the analysis offered by the medieval Jewish philosopher, Maimonides. I further demonstrate how his explanation is determined largely by his philosophic attitudes and differs radically from that reflected in talmudic sources. The meaning of pain has never ceased to be plumbed by man. How to avoid pain or, when inflicted, how to overcome it would probably account for a good deal of the development of civilization. Our concern at this point is with the problem of justification, how to find an ethical justification of suffering. Whether on a cosmic level or whether cut to the size of the individual the depiction of the "human condition" has served as an absorbing theme for novelist, artist, and poet. Humble man and scholar have alike struggled with fate, kismet, and rationaliza- tion to provide post facto explanations for the stroke of fortune. For the religious minded the difficulty involved in explaining the presence of pain is a theological one as well. It has been recently sum- marized by a prominent American philosopher of the pragmatic per- suasion as follows. The agony of the problem of evil consists in not understanding how an all-loving Father can permit His innocent children to be tortured in a world He has created. And although every honest theologian must in the end declare that the existence of evil is a Divine Mystery, the agony is not therewith dispelled. It may be at- tenuated by a temporary mood, but it keeps breaking through in every human being who has sensed in his own life and on his own skin something like the afflic- tions of Job.' It is noteworthy that in discussing human suffering and its justifica- tion Professor Hook casts an eye at the chief protaganist of the biblical drama that bears his name. Job has indeed epitomized throughout the ages the tantalizing dilemma of human existence, his susceptibility to sorrow and grief. Indeed, the buffetings administered to Job, as clas- sically portrayed in that epic text, are as relevant today as they were at any time. The ordeal of the sudden reversal of fortunes, personal Sidney Hook, The Quest for Being, p. 128. ? 1964, by the Society of Biblical Literature</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE afflictions, and the death of offspring have not lost their cogency in the twentieth century. Their agonizingly sharp edge has neither been blunted nor dulled. While pain and suffering have accompanied man throughout the ages, methods of justification may have differed. Naturally, a focal point for such disagreement may be mirrored in the interpretations offered by students of different ages in dealing with the dilemma of Job, the problem encountered in explaining the unity of the text. Con- temporary scholars differ widely in their analysis of the message and underlying philosophy of the work. Often too they are unaware of the traditional Jewish interpretations of this classic. I propose to compare the views of Maimonides with those of contemporary students, to show their elements of agreement and of disagreement, and also to refer to the ambivalent views of the Talmud with reference to Job and the basic problem of pain and its justification. Scholars, ancient and recent, evaluating the work have exposed abounding difficulties, of a textual, theological, and even logical nature. Textually, there are problems of sentence structure, phraseology, and consequent suggestions offered by them that the Hebrew text is the result of a translation from its original rendering in another language. Theologically, they venture to suggest that there is uncertainty just how "traditional" the views of the author are, whether they reflect a challenge to the status quo or mark a transition and revolutionary development from an earlier theological position. In line with this, the logical analysis of the position presented in the work tends to differ. A typical question is, are the prologue and epilogue that figure in the text essential to it or are they merely an appendage, tacked on to render it more palatable to the doctrinaire-minded powers that be. Perhaps the trenchant question posed by Sh. L. Gordon in the introduction to his Hebrew commentary on Job best reflects the spirit of bemused scholarship pondering in our day the intricacies of the text. Is Job truly the epitome of patience, he asks, as the text itself declares? Or is he the archprotestor, bitterly railing against his fate, unreconciled to his suffering? Gordon offers a "simple" solution: there is a surplus of Jobs - at any rate, two Job personalities - the narrative Job, that of the prologue; and the argumentative Job, figuring in the poetic debate. It is the former who declares with moving simplicity, "Shall we accept the good and not the bad?" while it is the latter who with bitter intensity prays "Let the day of my birth be forever forgotten!" This ambivalence and element of paradox which Gordon finds so perplexing but which our dialectically minded generation finds so stimu- lating pervades the entire text and assumes many forms. It has led Horace M. Kallen in The Book of Job As a Greek Tragedy to see it as essentially a Greek drama of the Euripidean form although with a Jewish spiritual problem and motif. Thus the "praises of wisdom" 346</page><page sequence="3">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB represent the traditional Greek chorus, the prologue and epilogue are identical with their equivalents in the Greek, while the disembodied "voice of God out of the whirlwind" at the climax of the work is the Jewish counterpart of the Greek deus ex machina. The author adopts a view of God as the God of all nature, with a standard of justice that is incomprehensible to man. This is declared to be the real intent of the work and is thus at variance with the essentially commonplace solution offered in the prologue, to the effect that suffering is designed to test man's righteousness. The latter is a cloak, designed to render acceptable the heresy, the advanced anthropomorphic-rejecting moral thought that is the true message of the author. It may be worthwhile at this point to summarize briefly the Joban narrative. Following the introduction of Job and the depicting of his character and exemplary good deeds, as well as his happy state, the opening scenes are laid in heaven. These constitute the prologue of the work. We witness God holding court with the "sons of God presenting themselves before the Lord." Job is hailed as a God-fearing man, up- right and shunning evil. Satan challenges this assertion, suggesting that this conduct may be attributed to Job's self-interest and his clever scheme to achieve divine favor which will yield the affluent and happy life which he is consequently enjoying: children, possessions, the bene- ficence of God. Were he to be bereft of these, "surely he will blaspheme thee to thy face." God accordingly grants Satan the privilege to go forth and test Job. Terrifying blows rain down upon Job. His children are wiped out, his fortune is decimated. Despite these afflictions Job remains steadfast. At the next heavenly session, however, Satan reiterates his conviction that Job's loyalty is only skin-deep. He is given more extensive powers: to do anything short of the ultimate, "only spare his life." Job is smitten with bitterly painful boils from head to foot. In spite of the fierce ex- hortation of his wife to "blaspheme God and die," Job remains steadfast and firm. "What? Shall we accept good and reject evil?" is his se- rene reply. His three friends - Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite - visit him and silently take stock of his suffer- ing. After a period, the poetic discourse between them commences. Job introduces it by ruing the day he was born. He maintains this attitude throughout the work, protesting the actions of God to whom he unquestioningly attributes his suffering, asserting his innocence. His friends, too, accept his suffering as the act of God, suggest sympathetically that he will eventually see better days, but insist that he undoubtedly deserved the suffering. Later another figure is introduced, Elihu the Buzite, and he too takes Job to task. Finally, after Job has demanded a confrontation with God, the Lord himself appears "out of the whirl- wind" and provides decisive judgment. At first he is apparently critical 347</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE of Job. Later, he declares Job to be right in his innocence and his friends to be in the wrong for doubting Job. Job is called upon to plead for the welfare and forgiveness of his friends. In the final act Job is happy once again, with children and fortune multiplied. An obvious puzzle that presents itself to the reader lies in the fact that the friends who are defending the justice of God are the ones to be rebuked by God. At first blush this appears unreasonable. Surely their view was plausible, indeed highly probable, even if, as it turned out, false. For man to sin is not improbable. "There liveth no man on earth who doeth good and sinneth not." Nor does the initial suggestion that Job is being tested seem to jibe with the subsequent debate concerning guilt which is the main burden of the work. What indeed is the purpose conveyed by the author in his literary architectonic? Judging from the prologue, we have said, the suggestion is that the purpose is to satisfy the curiosity of God, Satan, and the heavenly host as to whether Job can maintain his faithfulness despite unexpected, unprecedented, and undeserved suffering. This, however, does not seem to be at all the theme of the major part of the text, the heated debate which probes the question whether Job has sinned and his suffering consequently justified, or whether Job is as innocent as he claims and his suffering quite unjustified. II It is indeed the latter, seemingly subordinate motif that contemporary criticism has advanced as the gist of the message of the author. Most contemporary critics are convinced that the unknown author is opposing the traditional view which is defended by Job's colleagues to the effect that human suffering necessarily implies sinfulness, and divine retribu- tion for acts of evil. In the words of Samuel Wolk in the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Job lashes out against ". . . the too ready deduction that all suffering necessarily derived from disobedience with God. Be- hold a sufferer, there you see a sinner." Indeed, in his argument Job insists that he is undergoing suffering twiceover, in an unjustified manner. To begin with, there is the factual, objective suffering with which he is afflicted, so manifestly obvious to all. This pain is both physical and psychical. But then there is another and more insidious pain. That is derived from the fact that men, society, indeed his peers insist upon viewing him as obviously guilty of his fate. Therein lies the cataclysmic burden of his woe. In spite of his own certainty of his innocence, his so-called friends, pompous and complacent in their moral snobbery, feel justified in assailing him with their moral opprobrium. This of course tends to aggravate his painful distress, as he helplessly labors to breach their impervious wall of self-esteem and superiority. 348</page><page sequence="5">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB While a strong defense can be presented in favor of this argument, there are not lacking others who adopt the contrary view. In its extreme form the latter finds representation in the article by Joseph Hontheim, professor of dogmatic theology at St. Ignatius College, Holland, who writes in the Catholic Encyclopedia that in the prologue of the work we are informed of how "... with the permission of God, a holy man Job is tried by Satan with severe afflictions, in order to test his virtue. In succession Job bears six great temptations with heroic patience, and without the slightest wavering in loyalty to him. Then Job's three friends . .come to console him. Their visit is to become the seventh and greatest trial." Which is your choice? Certainly the Job who so terribly cries his innocence to deaf ears seems little like the prologue Job who manifests his stoic mettle unfalteringly in the face of cumulative pain, bolstered by an invincible faith. Little wonder that scholars find themselves im- paled on the horns of a dilemma in attempting to arrive at the estimation of which theme to declare dominant and determining. Shall we view it as an account of man's courage in the face of the dark possibilities of fate or have we a spirited dialogue concerning the meaning of pain and its relationship to the theological doctrine of reward and punishment? One can trace this ambivalent attitude toward the delineation of the Joban character throughout the literature. In the Bible itself, we find reference to Job. There, in Ezek 14 the prophet refers to three exalted personalities: Noah, Daniel, and Job. In a refrainlike spirit Ezekiel reiterates that when the Lord sees fit to wreak his vengeance upon a land nothing will save it. Though these three men be dwellers therein "they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness." Supposing the Job herein mentioned to be identical with our Job, which seems likely, it must be observed that while he is linked with two other noteworthy figures their moral superiority is not unlimited. At any rate, it is not deemed sufficient to bring salvation to others, "... they should deliver but their own souls...." Significantly, the sages of the Talmud remark of Noah, another of the three figures, that some rabbis spoke of him with approval while others were disposed to be contemptuous of his goodness, Noah seemingly being concerned with his own salvation and that of his family and blithely indifferent to the universal destruc- tion marking his era.2 Indeed comments in the Talmud indicate that Job was a far more controversial figure than he whose ark wobbled on the waters of the flood. Thus we are informed that two eminent sages who lived at the time of the destruction of the second temple, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai and Rabbi Joshua ben Hyrkanus had divergent views on the subject whether Job worshipped God out of fear or whether he was 2 B. Sanhedrin 108a. 349</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE inspired by love.3 In a later age, Rabbi Johanan voiced the opinion that Job was in fact superior to Abraham, "... for of Abraham Scripture merely records, "Now I know that thou fearest God..." but of Job Scriptures affirm, "... a whole-hearted and upright man fearing God and shunning evil."4 In a still later age, Rava differed, suggesting that Job was rebellious and heretical, wishing to "overturn the plate" and blaspheme.5 Disagreeing with him, Abaye suggested a more charitable and less stringent attitude, that "Job's ire was leveled against Satan rather than against his creator."6 Subsequently Rava himself offered a touching description of the goodness exhibited by Job. He lectured on the text (Job 29 13), "The blessing of him that was ready to perish came unto me, and the heart of the widow I caused to sigh for joy." This signifies that Job would rob a field belonging to orphans, in order to improve it and return it to them. Likewise if there was a widow whom no one wished to marry, he would attach his illustrious name to her so that people would flock to marry her."7 Nevertheless Rava still had misgivings, quoting sentences and phrases from Job which he found particularly vexatious, declaring at these times, "Dust should have been put in Job's mouth!"8 Throughout the talmudic literature this ambiguous, tentative judg- ment is constantly manifested. Thus while some declare Job to be a blasphemer, others suggest that the work might have been written by Moses. No doubt impelled by this moral paradox, their curiosity has found expression in discussions as to the time of the life of the author, whether in the era of Abraham, Moses, Ahasuerus, or later periods, perhaps finding - as some have suggested - in the concept of Job's trials a reflection and continuation of the Abrahamite and Mosaic trials as recorded in the Bible.9 Indeed, whether he was Jew or non-Jew they deemed a moot issue.Io Finally, whether Job was an existent personality or a "mashal," a parable created by the imagination of the author, received attentive consideration." III Given the problems suggested by the text of Job which the rabbinic sages found so provoking, it should not come to us as a great surprise to discover that the great medieval Jewish philosopher, Maimonides, gave the biblical work searching scrutiny as well. With his overriding concern to harmonize tradition and reason, particularly as exemplified by Aristotelian, Greek, as well as Muslim philosophy, he did not fail to appreciate the challenge implicit in this philosophic dialogue.

The perplexities of Job could not help but bring into question such a statement. With characteristic daring Maimonides refused to ignore the challenge and in fact took the occasion to offer an approach that is quite startling but wholly in accord with his position. It is in the third and final part of the Guide that Maimonides treats the text of Job, devoting several chapters to the explication of its knotty theological web. In order to grasp the unusual character of the solution he daringly suggests, I propose to select three propositions I deem particularly pertinent to the elucidation of the text. In terms of this set of proposi- tions, I feel that it is possible to formulate all the positions that have been taken in the controversies that have raged about it, and indeed delineate the different possible positions that can be logically enter- tained. Using this methodological approach we will then comprehend the essential difference between the view of Maimonides, the medieval philosopher, and those of contemporary commentaries. I offer the following general proposition: 1. All who suffer are guilty of sinfulness. Following modern logic, this can be recast into the hypo- thetical proposition: la. For all X, if X suffers, X is guilty of sinfulness. Throughout the course of the book, the friends of Job are seen as pre- pared to accept this proposition. The second proposition is: 2. Job is suffering. This proposition cer- tainly seems obvious. Yet it ought to be stated. His friends come to visit him. They silently view his manifest distress. His agony is apparent. He in turn does not attempt to hide his pain. Now, asserting the joint truth of the above two propositions, that is, of the hypothetical proposi- tion la, as well as proposition 2, which is the antecedent of proposition la, (when "Job" is substituted for "X") they draw the conclusion of la, which is proposition 3 - a typical syllogistic modus ponens of traditional logic - 3. Job is guilty of sinfulness. Here we have a simple hypothetical syllogism which constitutes the gist of the argument of Job's colleagues. Of course, the premise that suffering is the consequence of sin is based in turn on a number of be- liefs either intuitively known or revealed, such as the following: there is a God, he rules, he is just, etc. Perusal of the text indicates that these beliefs are never questioned but unqualifiedly accepted by Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. We are now in a position to appreciate Job's point of view. Job begins by denying proposition 3, Job is guilty of sinfulness. He knows on independent grounds - introspective self-analysis and self-awareness of his deeds - that he is innocent of any misdeeds. But proposition 3 is a conclusion from premises above, propositions la and 2. Job does not question the logic involved. If propositions la and 2 are true, 3 must follow. Hence he must demolish the premises. 351</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Certainly, proposition 2, Job is suffering, cannot be questioned. Job therefore has but one logical opening, that is, to question the theo- logical doctrine that is stated in proposition 1 or la, that suffering implies sinfulness, that all who suffer are receiving divine retribution. This is basically the position of modern scholars and students of Job. The author of Job, they declare, is eager to demolish proposition 1 which has heretofore been a tenet of the traditional theological doctrine, and has thus cast calumny upon those whom fate has submerged by heaping sorrows. Current commentators thus draw the conclusion that Job wishes to assert that pain is not retribution by God for evil conduct. Millar Burrows, in his article on Job in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, represents the typical attitude. Confident of his goodness, Job knows he cannot be suffering punishment. "Job .... vehemently asserting his innocence, is driven not only into anguished perplexity regarding God's ways, but even to outright denial of his justice." Driver and Gray also view it as a condemnation of the "...theory of suffering being always and merely penal...."I2 How Job can so confidently assert his goodness may seem puzzling to some. It appears to reflect a lack of that humility which one usually associates with goodness. It smacks of moral snobbery. One must, however, recall that the fact that he is virtuous constitutes an essential part of the argument, and we can view it logically as a proposition that can be validly entertained. It enables us to examine the paradox of the righteous man suffering pain in a cosmos admittedly ruled and regulated by a just and omnipotent and all-knowing God. In view of the above, the charge of the sages of the Talmud that Job was practically guilty of "overturning the plate," of blasphemy, is dramatically evident. Job apparently at no time questions the existence of God. Nor does he question or doubt the fact that his pain stems from God's will. The problem that vexes him is, where is the justice of God, surely an attribute basic in his nature? He pleads for the opportunity to confront God. Boldly he declares in ch. 13, "I would speak to the Almighty and I desire to reason with God." He urges his friends not to resort to falsehoods and manifest lies in rising to the defense of God, by convicting Job of sinfulness. "Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? Will ye show him favor? Will ye contend for him?" He asserts his love and trust in God while persistently questioning his justice. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. But I will argue my ways before him". In a final outburst of speech, he addresses himself directly to God. "Only do not do two things unto me, then will 12 ICC, Job, p. lix. 352</page><page sequence="9">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB I not hide myself from thee; withdraw thy hand far from me; and let not thy terror make me afraid... answer thou me, how many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me to know my transgressions and my sins." The epilogue in which God makes his appearance out of the whirlwind is the response to the daring challenge so boldly and righteously offered by Job. No wonder that the talmudic sage Rava was of the opinion that "dust should have been in Job's mouth" for the presumptive words he uttered. This same Rava deduced from the Joban episode the moral: (lnyx nytn Dnm o-n ] W ]'V) :13 one cannot be held accountable for what is said in pain. Undergoing suffering, one inevitably loses mastery over oneself and control over one's speech. The problem, be it observed, is not only a subjective one. Assuming that Job is justified in the conviction of his own innocence and further- more accepting unquestioningly the proposition of God's providence and that all pain stems from God, one is forced to conclude that suffering cannot imply sinfulness. This can only lead Job to question the justice of God, whom in the same breath he avows he loves and trusts. Of course, a glance at the prologue of the work does at the very onset reveal the conviction of the author of Job that pain may be present in nature for other purposes. In particular, it can serve as a test of man. Was not Abraham too tested? According to the Talmud the proposed sacrifice of Isaac was the final and supreme test to which Abraham was exposed, as founder of the faith.'4 Thus pain may be designed to reveal whether faith is mere surface dressing or constitutes an abiding and integral element in the constitution of the individual. Hence, one may deny proposition la, that pain implies sinfulness, and thus deny the conclusion that Job has sinned, without necessarily being compelled to question the justice of God. This indeed seems at times to be the position of the Talmud. In a remarkable passage we are told that Rava, the same rabbi quoted above, declared: "If a man sees that troubles are descending upon him, let him scrutinize his deeds, as it is said, 'Let us search through and examine our deeds and let us return to the Lord' (Lam 3). If, following investigation, he finds nothing to warrant his pain, let him attribute it to a neglect of the study of Torah, as it is said, 'Happy is the man whom thou hast admonished, O Lord, and teachest out of thy Torah' (Ps 94). If he investigates further and does not find that he has neg- lected the study of Torah, then they are afflictions stemming from God's love," as it is said, 'Because whomever the Lord loveth he ad- monisheth' (Prov 3)."sI '3 B.

Berakot 5a. 353</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The concept of ,mn' v, l"1n'' (love-permeated afflictions) should be of keen interest to students of precursors of existentialism. It provides a fascinating phenomenon of religious experience. Developing and sup- porting this thesis, the Talmud cites instances of various sages who were judged to be undergoing suffering which was deemed to be of the category of divine love - originating afflictions. Indeed, certain criteria for such phenomena of pain were offered. One, the suffering did not prevent the subject from pursuing the study of Torah - presumably a test of devotion. Another criterion was that one could shed it when it proved to be unbearable. For this, another sage was essential who served as the liberating agent, since, "A prisoner cannot free himself from prison." The procedure was, that the liberating sage would ask: "Do you want the pains?" and the response would be lnDw i 1n V ("neither them nor their reward")! Upon receiving this response the first sage would extend his hand, the other would grasp it and then arise cured.'6 Nevertheless, when a sage suffered pain, the sages of the Talmud did not leap to the conclusion that the explanation lay in the afflicted being the object of God's love. The principle of weighing one's deeds was still primary and more credible. They displayed fearless candor, not hesitating to be outspoken with those who were the most respected and highly placed. Thus in the same context the Talmud records that when Rav Huna, the head of the Academy, suffered the misfortune of having four hundred barrels of wine turn sour, he was seized by a deep melancholy and despair. Hearing that he was brooding, the rabbis came to visit him, and urged, "Let the master investigate his activities." The remark affronted him. "What!" he retorted, "Do you believe me guilty of wrongdoing?" They soothed him by saying, "Would we suspect the Holy One, blessed be he, of wrongdoing?" Calming down, Rav Huna proved to be in a more conciliatory and reflective mood. He said, "If you have heard aught against me, tell me." They replied, "We have heard that the master allows his tenant no share in the wines." "Aye," said Rav Huna, "the reason is simple. He steals all the produce of my vineyards and leaves me nothing." "Nevertheless," they replied, "there is a maxim, that whoever steals of a thief, smells of theft." "If so," he replied, "I promise to give him his share." Thereupon, according to one opinion, the vinegar turned winy again and, according to another, the price of vinegar rose to equal the price of wine.I7 At all events, what is relevant to our analysis is that, the talmudic sages did not find themselves in the tight dialectical squeeze in which Job and his colleagues felt themselves confined. They possessed a liberty 16 B. Berakot Sb. '7 Ibid. 354</page><page sequence="11">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB of maneuver, although they did not needlessly resort to it. Pain did not invariably stem from the divine desire to chastise and admonish, although it did have divine authority and sanction. It could, paradoxically enough, be a manifestation of God's love and selection. Still, the prob- lem of the righteous suffering and the evildoer knowing the joys of life they probed with unabated interest. IV To understand the position of Maimonides with reference to the issues raised by Job and the manner in which he differed from the afore- mentioned rabbinic view - leaning on other rabbinic statements to support his contentions - as well as differing from the doctrines of our contemporaries, a brief introduction may be helpful. In part 3 of the Guide Maimonides discusses the view of the philosophers with reference to the problem of chance versus divine providence.'8 Probing further, he distinguishes with reference to the concept of providence different schools of thought, which stress respectively: the will of God, the wisdom of God, and finally the justice of God. Thus, in ch. 17 of part 3 of the Guide Maimonides summarizes the view of the Greek and Muslim schools of philosophy as follows. Epicurus, he declares, adopts the most extreme interpretation of chance, as involved in all events, in the un- ceasing combinations of atoms. Aristotle is more reserved, limiting chance to the sublunar sphere; beyond, providence reigns. Unlike these schools of Greek philosophy the Mohammedan philos- ophers support the point of view of providence, insisting that all events take place in accordance with a divine pattern set by an Intelligence. Nothing, they say, is due to chance. However, they differ in their explanation of pain. The school of Ashariyah is of the opinion that will alone is consequential. God wills. There need be no explanation as to why God wills. Indeed, "It is proper that God should afflict the innocent and do good to the sinner."19 The rule of justice does not apply. Nor need there be compensation for pain inflicted. On the other hand, the Mutazilites insist that it is not a matter of mere will. We ought to view these actions as due to the inscrutable wisdom of God, which we mortals cannot fathom. Thus, it is conceivable that the innocent may suffer affliction; however, he may rest assured that eventually he will receive his due reward, his recompense for pain undergone. It is all a matter of God ruling human destiny in accordance with standards of wisdom that are beyond human intelligence. Maimonides rejects both chance and providence as thus interpreted. He declares that this is not in accordance with the approach of Judaism. Is Guide to the Perplexed, Part 3, pp. 65 ff. (Friedlander's translation). '9 Op. cit., p. 70. 355</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Human affairs, he asserts, are managed with justice. If man suffers anguish, humiliation, and the like, it is indeed punishment for sins performed.20 He quotes many passages from both Scriptures and Talmud in support of his position. Thus, the sages distinctly declare, "There is no death without sin, no sufferings without transgression."21 He offers a citation from the Mishnah Sotah, "The deserts of man are meted out to him in the same measure which he himself employs."22 Maimonides is convinced that this principle is necessary if the doc- trine of free will is to be maintained. He speaks of man enjoying "per- fectly free will";23 at times he adds the qualifying remark, "... within the limits of his capacity."24 Nevertheless, in whichever form, it remains a cardinal principle in his ethical and religious system. He stresses, "Against this principle we hear, thank God, of no opposition on the part of our nation,"25 thus appealing to accepted Jewish acknowledg- ment of his analysis of the Jewish theory of ethic. Premising human freedom, Maimonides then asserts that since "... wrong cannot be ascribed to God... all evils and afflictions, as well as all kinds of happiness of man, whether they concern one in- dividual person or a community, are distributed according to justice; they are the result of strict judgment that admits no wrong whatever."26 Maimonides here extends the concept of justice and the distribution of happiness from the individual to the community or group, without attempting to provide the steps essential to the demonstration that "free will" and consequent responsibility apply to the collective level. He contents himself with the blanket judgment above quoted: "Against this (extended) principle we hear, thank God, no opposition on the part of our people." In confirmation he quotes the passage from Deu- teronomy, "All his ways are judgment." Through human inadequacy we are "ignorant of the working of that judgment."27 While Maimonides thus glosses over the problem posed by society, one is at liberty to speculate whether the application of the concept of freedom to this more abstract entity does not serve to reveal difficulties transcending the individual level. Maimonides is of the opinion that there is indeed a relationship of inevitability between sinfulness and punishment. He thus subscribes to the view that others are disposed to challenge. Such inevitability is not of the logical variety in the sense that the concept of sinfulness includes the concept of punishment. Rather, acknowledging the fact 20 Op. cit., p. 72. 2I Op. cit., p. 73. 22 Ibid. 23 Op. cit., p. 71. 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid. 26 Op. cit., p. 72. 27 Ibid. 356</page><page sequence="13">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB that the universe is subject to God who rules with justice, sinfulness will inevitably have punishing consequences. On theological grounds, iniquity is both necessary and sufficient to account for pain, given the palpable presence of the divine hegemony. While passages in the Bible and Talmud can be assembled to support this doctrine, others, as we have seen, are contrariwise. The concept of "afflictions of love" certainly does not seem to support this view. Indeed, the concept of pains as trials, which the Bible applies to Abraham, appears to weaken the need for assuming such "inevitability." Maimonides at one point suggests that such an interpretation of the biblical position conforms to the Mutazilite position and is not the Jewish point of view. "The wise men mentioned in the Talmud did not notice it; only some of the later geonim (heads of the academies) were pleased with it when they heard it from the sect of the Mutazilites, and accepted it."28 Indeed, later on he is disposed to offer a novel explanation and interpretation of the concept of "trials," wholly at variance with the common sense view. Maimonides, indeed, would have rejected un- equivocally the attitude expressed by Dr. Hontheim in the Catholic Encyclopedia of Job suffering a series of trials, as wholly at variance with the Jewish philosophic position. Admitting that some of our sages do approve of it, he is nevertheless insistent that the general opinion is opposed. He rejects it on two grounds. To begin with, he reiterates his conviction that the administration of pain for any other reason than sinfulness would be a matter of injustice.29 Scripture, however, teaches the inconceivability of God being unjust. "He is a God of faithfulness, and there is no iniquity in him" (Deut 32 4). Probably realizing the evident weakness of the argument, resting as it does not so much upon a defense of justice, as upon its definition, he offers another reason. In what sense, he asks, need God try man? Surely he knows.30 Actions of man, actual or potential, are already revealed to him. "God knows the thoughts of man." There is no need to test; testing suggests a confirmation or rejection of a hypothesis. To paraphrase the Laplacian notion, God has no need for hypothesis. His omniscience is assumed. What then does testing mean in the biblical context? It means to teach. "The sole object of all the trials mentioned in Scriptures is to teach man what he ought to do or believe; so that the event which forms the actual trial is not the end desired; it is but an example serving as illustration for instruction and guidance." God does not test; he need not probe. Rather, he wishes "the world," the human race, to 28 Op. cit., p. 74. 29 Op. cit., p. 112. 30 Op. cit., p. 113. 357</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE know.3' Furthermore, he declares, 9"nb does not really mean to test one as much as to "accustom" one. Thus, by experiencing "tests" and hardships, the children of Israel in the wilderness were toughened and conditioned to overcome more effectively the lethargic and decadent inhabitants of the Promised Land.32 Finally, a "test" or trial has the pyschological effect of increasing any subsequent joy experienced.33 Maimonides concludes this discussion by stating with great emphasis: "... we must not think that God desires to examine us and to try us in order to know what he did not know before. Far is this from him: he is far above that which ignorant and foolish people imagine con- cerning him, in the evil of their thoughts. Note this."34 At all events, what emerges clearly is the insistence of Maimonides upon the doctrine that pain inevitably implies punishment. Now, this is the proposition which we saw above is involved in the Joban debate, which Job's colleagues unquestioningly assert, but which he is impelled to challenge, in view of his self-awareness, his confidence in his own innocence. Maimonides is thus in the most novel position of insisting upon a philosophic doctrine which the protagonist of a biblical work is passionately opposed to and heatedly rejecting. He thus is confronted by a most difficult choice: shall he insist upon the view which he believes accords with his whole conception of Jewish ethic and philosophy and thus reject summarily the teaching of Job? Or, in light of the suggestions of this Scriptural work, shall he undertake to review his entire philosophy? V To this problem Maimonides brings to bear his masterful intellect, his unrivaled reasoning skill. Devoting three chapters to the topic, he advances a suggestion by which he is convinced he is able to harmonize - despite the seeming contradiction - the two doctrines, thereby avoiding the seemingly inevitable collision of doctrines and the need for adopting an either/or approach. Furthermore, the explanation he offers is not ad hoc but is in full conformity with his entire spiritual philosophy, which is based precisely upon such a linguistic analysis and recasting of meanings of words which appear in the central doctrines of Judaism. Maimonides squarely confronts the issue at the commencement of his analysis of the work by declaring that the "strange and wonderful" book of Job is indeed a philosophic work, the motif of which is the theme of divine providence. It is not a story of actual fact: it is, as one of our sages has declared, a fictional narrative, conceived for the purpose of examining "the different opinions which people hold on divine provi- dence."35 Supporting this contention, he argues convincingly that even 31 Op. cit., p. 114; cf. Deut 8 16. 32 Ibid. 33 Ibid. 34 Op. cit., p. 118. 35 Op. cit., p. 93. 358</page><page sequence="15">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB those who insist that the narrative is fact would admit that the prologue, pertaining to the discussion of God and Satan, is fiction or parable. Evidently then it proposes to engage in discussions of doctrines of theological and ethical importance. Maimonides then depicts Job as one who is groping for the truth. He declares, "It is remarkable that wisdom is not ascribed to Job. The text does not say he was an intelligent, wise, or clever man; but virtues and uprightness, especially in actions, are ascribed to him."36 He argues, "If he (Job) were wise, he would not have had any doubt about the cause of his suffering, as will be shown later on."37 Thus Maimonides prepares the way for his argument that Job is, at the begin- ning, propounding a view that is false and which he later relinquishes. Maimonides then develops the idea that in the discussion concerning divine providence contained in the book of Job the diverse philosophical attitudes which we summarized above can be discovered. Each of these views finds its spokesman in the Scriptural work. Thus, Zophar offers the view of the Ashariyah that providence is simply will alone, with justice altogether inapplicable.38 Bildad represents the view of the Mutazilites that actions reveal the inscrutable wisdom of God, man being duly compensated for his pain.39 Finally, Eliphaz advances the correct theological point of view that the fate of man, and of Job as well, is in accordance with strict justice.40 This leaves our original problem still unsolved. It is Elihu, the later participant, judged by commentators to be verbose and redundant who, Maimonides argues, advances a powerful new idea.4' At first, says Maimonides, he appears to be repetitious. Denying this, Maimonides argues that Elihu is fostering the concept of clarity of meaning: particularly, that while man speaks of God's benevolence and rulership this is not to be confused with our human conception of what benevolence and rulership ought to be. "... when we say that he rules his creatures, we do not mean that he does the same as we do when we rule over other things."42 This enlightening statement of semantic import by Elihu prepares Job for the appearance of God out of the whirlwind, and for the climactic moment when wisdom is imparted to him. It is, of course, an application of the doctrine of homonymy, the semantic rule pertaining to the Bible which Maimonides developed and applied throughout his work in order to achieve his program of harmonizing Scriptures with the teachings of philosophy. To understand how Maimonides manages to by-pass the problem posed for his theology by the doctrines found within Job let us revert to the methodology which we utilized earlier. We have seen that there 36 Op. cit., p. 96. 37 Ibid. 38 Op. cit., p. 105. 39 Ibid. 359 40 Ibid. 41 Op. cit., p. 108. 42 Op. cit., p. 110.</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE are three propositions which can be formulated, through which the respective positions of Job and his colleagues can be explicated. Proposition la is that all who suffer are guilty of iniquity. Proposition 2 states that Job is suffering. This is the first part, the antecedent of proposition la. Job's colleagues then affirm both propositions 1 and 2 and they arrive at proposition 3, which is the conclusion of proposition la, that Job is guilty of iniquity. Job, we saw earlier, begins by denying 3. He is confident of his innocence. Hence, argue current commentators, he must of necessity support his claim by demolishing the hypothetical syllogism above not of course, by simply disregarding the logical force of the argument. Rather, by denying one of the premises of the syllogism, namely, propo- sition la, that all pain inevitably implies iniquity. Certainly this seems to be the gist of the argument that Job advances throughout the work. Of course, at the climactic scene with God Job seems to be reproved, a fact that commentators find difficult to reconcile with their contention. But, they retort, do not the colleagues of Job suffer a more severe re- proof? Obviously the major argument of Job is still being vindicated. Contemporary scholars assert that it is only the charge of Job that God is unjust - still resting obliquely upon the implicit acceptance of the view that pain is a sign of iniquity - which is undergoing censure. Maimonides approaches the propositional set as found in the Joban argument by accepting his view of proposition 3, namely, his denial of guilt. Job is innocent. He is not guilty of iniquity. Moreover, as we have seen, he is disposed to offer the strictest possible interpretation of the proposition la. He insists that if one is suffering, one is guilty of iniquity: the two are "inevitably" related. Justice demands that the innocent one undergo no suffering. But, Job is suffering. This is proposi- tion 2. Maimonides is thus in the untenable logical position of being compelled to confirm proposition 3, that Job is guilty of iniquity, which is the conclusion of the argument of the above propositions. But, we have said, he is disposed to reject it, having accepted Job's statement as fact concerning his innocence. How to escape this illogical position? Maimonides does so by simply denying proposition 2, namely, that Job is suffering! Contrary to the evidence which the text of Job advances to demonstrate that Job is suffering, contrary to the fact that Job's friends confirm that Job is suffering, Maimonides insists that the conclusion of the Scriptural text rests on the assumption that Job is not suffering, since he had obtained true felicity."43 This is the purpose of God's appearance out of the whirlwind. Certainly it will be granted that this removes and resolves the logical 43 Op. cit., p. 104. 360</page><page sequence="17">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB problem. Deny the antecedent of a hypothetical proposition, and you need no longer assert the consequent. Hence, given that Job is not suffering, it no longer follows that Job is guilty of iniquity. Job is vindicated in his assertion, while at the same time taken to account for voicing the suggestion that God is unjust. This confronts us with the problem of fact. God is not unjust since we affirm the proposition that Job is not suffering. We deny proposition 2. But, how can we deny the evidence of our eyes? Indeed did not Job's three colleagues arrive to confirm with their own senses the reports about the suffering of Job? Did they not sit silently, watching him grovel in pain, bemoaning his wretched fate? Maimonides has managed to escape the rigidity imposed by the syllogistic argument which had confronted him, only to engulf himself in a problem of fact, a denial of a situation supported by all the evidence of common sense. Indeed, according to Maimonides it is precisely the proposition that both Job and his adversaries are disposed to accept that is ultimately rejected. Only when Job becomes truly "wise"- and here Maimonides would probably reject the classification of one contemporary who would not assign the work a place in the wisdom literature of the Bible - does he, and eventually his opponents, concur in this denial of a proposition hitherto accepted as obviously true. Maimonides is not, of course, really denying the validity of proposi- tion 2, that Job is in pain, that is, in bodily pain. Job, says Maimonides, failed to realize that the theological proposition which strictly implicates pain with iniquity does not involve physical, corporeal suffering. This is the revolutionary slant by which Maimonides is able to dispose of the problem in accord with the tenets of his philosophy. The fallacy of the entire controversy, he asserts, circulates about the fact that Job simply was lacking in "wisdom." He was in error only "so long as he was without wisdom, and knew God only by tradition, in the same manner religious people generally know him."44 Once, however, he attained wisdom, as soon as he had acquired a perspective enlarged by a true knowledge of God, the Joban issue simply resolved itself and faded away: "no earthly trouble can disturb it."45 Like modern com- mentators, but through an approach uniquely his own, Maimonides emerges as a revolutionary, challenging those who know "God only by tradition... as religious people generally know him." The error of Job, is the dictum of Maimonides, lay in assuming that "satisfaction" and "pain," of which we speak in proposition la, refer to earthly, material pleasures and pains. "So long as Job's knowledge of God was based on tradition and communication, and not on research, he believed that such imaginary good as is possessed in health, riches, 45 Ibid. 361 44 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and children was the utmost that man can attain."46 Later, when he enjoyed the revelation of the truth the nature of intrinsic good became clear to him: "No earthly trouble can disturb it."47 Maimonides quotes effectively from the final chapter of Job, "... but now my eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent because of dust and ashes."48 That is to say, he abhored his earlier values which had led him to mourn his earthly losses and to give vent to sensations of loss by covering himself with "dust and ashes." It is because of this dramatic reversal, revealing a transformation of values, Maimonides urges, that God then vindicates Job, declaring of Eliphaz, and the others, "... for you have not spoken to me the thing that is right as my servant Job hath."49 It is Job who manifests the capacity for development and thus rises to full spiritual stature, able to comprehend and acknowledge the great spiritual truth that true joy lies in the enjoyment of the Divine Vision; that pain is really a spiritual "vacuum," the lack of or deprivation from the Divine Vision. True, there are many contingencies of life, sorrows and joys with which life is replete. These, however, are not the criteria of sinfulness - and here Maimonides is actually in agreement with contemporary commentaries although he attains his objective by an entirely different theological route. External, material trials and sufferings are not the indications of God's disfavor and the evidence of human iniquity and sinfulness, just as human pleasures are not to be taken as evidence of God's favor and of human worth. Rather, the criterion of goodness and iniquity lies in the presence of that inner awareness manifesting an affinity or harmony in the instance of pleasure, and lack of harmony with the divine presence in the seizure by suffering and unbearable ennui. This is the true measure and gauge of joy and pain - its spiritual definition, in the theological statement of justice within the philosophic construc- tion of Judaism. In more modern terms, rendered in the patois of the existentialist, pain may be viewed as the sense of nausea, manifested by aimless in- significant, purposeless existence. It is the veritable mark of Cain, stamped on human existence, the consciousness of an everwidening gulf of guilt and of despair. There is the quality of morose incapacity to confront oneself and honor one's Creator. It is only in the felt presence of the Divine that the sense of liberation, of true realization of human potentiality, is experienced. In the theological sense, Maimonides relegates material pleasures and pains to a subordinate category. Children - "our" children are sometimes classed as possessions and reflect our psychological needs are a projection of our ego. They also represent some of the most sig- 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 362 48 Ibid. 49 Op. cit., p. 105.</page><page sequence="19">LAKS: THE ENIGMA OF JOB nificant bonds which we establish during the course of our lives: of friendship and of love, in its most self-subordinating form. They are a fulfillment of our dreams and aspirations. Yet ultimately they represent contingencies over which the individual cannot really manifest sway. They therefore cannot constitute criteria of human goodness or of iniquity. These can derive solely from the essence of the inner life, cultivated by the individual and the sense of divine accord which he thus may achieve. To repeat, Maimonides is thus asserting that Job is not suffering. Hence, while suffering does inevitably imply sinfulness, Job cannot thus be indicted and judged. The reason is that suffering in the theological proposition is not to be construed in material terms, which include loss of riches, possessions, children, or the deprivation of health and the presence of physical pain. As long as he enjoys serenity of soul - and Job, as the text indicates, does enjoy the revelation of the Divine he is spiritually happy, at one with God, and hence sinless. The gist of Maimonides' message and interpretation of Job is that the semantic reference of "pain" in proposition la has been wrongly construed. It may be noted too that the appearance of God in the final scene is not a deus ex machina as Kallen would propose. Rather the revelation is essential to the argument, in which the denial of proposition 2 (that Job is suffering) is at stake. God's presence, the sense of inwardness achieved by Job, testifies that he is innocent: ". . . mine eye seeth thee."s5 Job's joy, despite material pain, manifestly is boundless. Certainly the Maimonidean interpretation of Job is highly ingenious. Moreover, it conforms with the basic tenets of his philosophic position. Be it observed that it retains the concept of divine justice as central to Judaism, integral to the concept of providence, while transmuting it so as to become, to all intents, identical with divine love. Only it is in reverse, urging in typical Jewish fashion that divine love is realizable by all who are sinless and turn to God. On the spiritual plane, pleasure and love become equivalent, the terms synonymous. It is only those who are iniquitous and turn aside from God who "suffer," forfeiting the glorious light, beyond which is spiritual pain and unbearable spiritual anguish. Thus, like contemporary scholars, Maimonides also succeeds in avoiding the obloquy by which unreflecting people, "religious people generally," have felt that physical suffering and pain convict a person. Those who insist upon seeing a necessary causal relation between physical suffering and sin are not "wise." Suffering in this sense cannot constitute a criterion of theological value for the exposure of human sinfulness. Ultimately, it is the way of life of a person, his perceptiveness of God so Op. cit., p. 104; Job 42 5. 363</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and enjoyment of the blessed state, that constitute the evidence of good or evil. Maimonides probably knew whereof he spoke. His own life was not bereft of physical pain. The shipwreck and death of his beloved brother, his busy life punctuated by the whims of caliphs, the upheavals and forced migrations of his people undergone in his time were not conducive to a sheltered existence, divorced from physical pain. It was the ability to overcome these shocks and maintain his spiritual balance and serenity which Maimonides believed, in the spirit of Job as he expounded it, provide the ultimate criterion indicative of whether he was spiritually debased or whether he enjoyed the state of blessed goodness. It might be questioned whether, bearing in mind the special spiritual meaning assigned by Maimonides to "suffering" in proposition la, he might have retained the doctrine of trials which we discussed above, limiting it to physical suffering. Thus, there need be no collision between the two doctrines of God's justice and of pain (physical) suffered for the sake of trials. Nevertheless Maimonides undoubtedly felt that the whole doctrine of trials was questionable, inconsistent with the concept of God's omniscience. Hence he was impelled to reject it. Methodologically speaking, between the medieval, Maimonidean commentary on the one hand and those of modern times on the other, the formal possibilities for variations in interpretations of Job seem to be exhausted. One can either challenge proposition la, which asserts a rigid relationship between pain and iniquity, as the moderns do, or one can assert the denial of proposition 2 as Maimonides does, insisting that Job is not undergoing "pain" in the theological sense of the word. Despite the formal limitations, however, it is amazing how many fascinating new studies based on these themes are constantly appearing. One interesting example is offered in the work on Job written by the late Robert Frost, A Masque of Reason in 1945. Continuing the Book of Job by proposing a 43rd chapter he suggests a denouement in which God confesses that pain has no purpose. All is senseless mockery. In terms of our methodology, he is proceeding by denying proposition la, probably in its most extreme, nihilistic form. Psychoanalytic thinkers, like Jung and Adler, have also dealt with Job and his significance. Thus flows the continuing stream of commentary lapping at the base of the towering work of Job, probing at the meaning of human suffering, reflecting the quintessence of human ethic as seen by each succeeding generation. It is thus worthy of note that despite all subsequent studies of Job down to our very own day the exposition offered by Maimonides has not lost its pertinence or luster. Indeed, both as an ethical treatise and as an explanation of the apparently discordant ingredients of the text one may judge it to be unmatched and unrivaled. 364</page></plain_text>
