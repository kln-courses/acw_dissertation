He layered his own personal history into the present, incorporating rem- nants of his father's passbook into the panels. The passbook, a signifier of restricted move- ment, allows the artist to chart how far he has come at the same time that he finds similari- ties between black urban history and experi- ence throughout the diaspora. Willie Bester's mixed-media assemblage, The Notorious Green Car (1995), is the most direct evocation of the repressive and constricting forces of apartheid. The work recalls the police cars that patrolled the black settlements during the apartheid regime as well as Bester's own experience of imprisonment. The densely packed frame full of compacted objects negates space and move- ment in a fashion that is at the other extreme from Jantjes's unlimited expanse. The relationship of the artists to space, movement, and barriers may be determined by their racial identity and experiences during apartheid. The exhibition, however, did not make any overt reference to their racial back- ground (or gender), although inferences can be made from the descriptive object labels. This curatorial decision can be viewed as an attempt to force viewers to move beyond biography and race in confronting and appreciating these works-to prevent them from resting comfort- ably on assumptions and prejudices, both con- scious and unconscious. However, given the significance of race within the South African context and the way it affected access to artistic training, resources, and exhibition venues, the brief discussion of apartheid in the exhibition brochure was insufficient. I do not advocate wallowing in biography and contextual infor- mation, but it is a disservice to viewers with limited knowledge of South Africa not to be more explicit about the artists' relationship to this key issue. Even though the country has moved into a post-apartheid phase, South Africa's present and future are still largely de- termined by the legacy of its racially segregat- ed past.

Cold Turkey: Stories of Truth and Reconciliation (1996) consists of two photograph-based as- semblages that reference actual events from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a public forum for victims of violence as well as for alleged attackers who came forward to testify about their crimes as a condition of their being considered for amnesty. The National Museum of African Art is to be commended for the show, despite any dif- ferences of opinion one might have regard- ing its conceptual framework. The exhibition announced that unbeknownst to many, the museum has spent the last decade acquiring an impressive selection of recent South African art and is paving the way for greater consideration of this material in our hemisphere. And this is only a part of a larger agenda. With the cre- ation of the Sylvia H. Williams Gallery, named in memory of the museum's former director, the National Museum of African Art has opened the first permanent museum exhibition space in the United States that is devoted to moder and contemporary African art. An exhibition catalogue would have been a desirable complement to the show. I was left wanting more information and historical background: the incusion of several works produced during the 1960s and 1970s by artists congregated at the art and craft center in Rorke's Drift, Natal, only whetted my appetite. Judging by the available literature, there is still much scholarly work on South African art to be done. One hopes that exhibi- tions such as this will focus more attention on the subject. The exhibition was enhanced by several pub- lic programs: the artist Rudzani Nemasetoni gave two gallery talks; the museum hosted a film series, "South African Cinema: Past, Present, Future"; and the NMAfA Web site provided the exhibition brochure on-line. The annual Smith- sonian Folklife Festival on the Mall also devoted one of their programs to South Africa. Fortunately, New York's Museum for Afri- can Art has produced the traveling exhibition "Liberated Voices: Contemporary Art from South Africa," which offers further opportu- nity to examine this compelling art. [ KILENGI African Art from the Bareiss Family Collection The University of Iowa Museum of Art Iowa City, Iowa March 27-May 23, 1999 Reviewed by Aimee Bessire As visitors entered the University of Iowa Museum of Art to view "Kilengi: African Art from the Bareiss Family Collection," they were welcomed by two large Sukuma dance figures from Tanzania. These visually provocative sculptures literally enticed one into the exhibi- tion not unlike the way they attract spectators in Sukuma dance competitions. The figures are so striking, in fact, that they were used as an emblem (a mascot of sorts) on banners and posters for the exhibition as it traveled in Europe, where it was exhibited in Hanover, Munich, and Vienna, and the States, first at the University of Iowa Museum of Art and then at the Neuberger Museum of Art (State University of New York, Purchase). 79</page><page sequence="2">Installation view of "Kilengi: African Art from the Bareiss Family Collection" at the University of Iowa Museum of Art. What perhaps was most striking about the Sukuma dance figures for some visitors was that they were so unlike the African "master- pieces" we have been conditioned to expect from museum exhibitions. In this way, they are representative of the uniqueness of the exhibition as a whole in highlighting East African art. Historically, East and Southern Africa have been marginalized, even ignored, in the Western-constructed canon of African art. This situation is slowly changing. The 1995 Royal Academy exhibition "Africa: The Art of a Continent," while problematic in many ways, was successful in laying the groundwork for the inclusion of art from these two areas of the continent. That show was preceded, in 1994, by the German exhibi- tion "Tanzania: Meisterwerke Afrikanischer Skulptur/Sanaa za Mabingwa wa Kiafrika" (Berlin and Munich), with its singular focus on the arts of Tanzania. If one examines the sections taxonomized in "Kilengi" and its accompanying catalogue, the thrust of the Bareiss collection and the cura- torial agenda are quickly revealed. Following the strengths of the collection, three sections in the catalogue are devoted to East Africa, six to Central Africa, and only one to West Africa. In an article for this journal on the Bareiss collec- tion, the curator, Christopher Roy, described his journey into what to him had been the "unknown" realm of East and Central Africa: "...like Pliny discovering Africa in 79 A.D., I discovered in the Bareiss collection dozens of powerful objects that challenged the worn-out canon of 'classical' African 'masterpieces'" (African Arts, Summer 1999, p. 57). In his catalogue essay ("Reinventing the Canon: New Forms and Functions of African Art"), Roy argues against a "western invented formalist canon" and suggests the need to con- textualize objects. He explains his criteria for selecting works for the exhibition: "Objects that are well carved, that demonstrate some age and signs of local use, and that are expressive, visu- ally exciting, intellectually stimulating" (African Arts, p. 57). Yet many would define these qual- ities as characteristic of the quintessential clas- sical canon, and in some ways this statement is at odds with Roy's desire to renegotiate it. Perhaps more important than "reinventing the canon," the objects in "Kilengi" break down assumptions that privilege West Africa and relegate places like Tanzania to a "sculp- tural desert." "Kilengi," which Roy suggests derives "from several Bantu languages of east Central Africa, means the enjoyment that comes from looking at beautiful objects" (African Arts, pp. 57-58). As the title suggests, the objects in the exhibition, starting with the Sukuma dance figures that welcomed the visitor, were meant for visual consumption, and these were excit- ing examples of African art far too little seen. Consider, for example, the anthropomorphic Makonde medicinal container with skin cov- 80 STEVE TATUM, THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA MUSEUM OF ART ering, the Kamba figure with woven cloth skirt and metal ornament, and the Maasai bas- ketry-covered calabash with anthropomor- phic stopper. Little is known about some of the objects and more research is required, as is evidenced by the unidentified male-female pair from South Africa or Mozambique. It was stimulating to see examples of arts that had not been published before, and although the majority of the pieces were figural, one hopes that later collections and exhibitions will include examples of nonfigural arts from East and Southern Africa. The exhibition displayed the visual power of these objects and attempted to contextual- ize them historically and culturally within a taxonomy of six geographical areas visually distinguished in the museum by pastel wall colors: Tanzania and Kenya in light blue; Southeastern Africa in light green; South Central Africa and Southeastern Congo in yel- low; Southern and Western Congo in gray; Northern and Northeastern Congo in light orange; and West Africa in ivory. In each of these sections, the objects were geographical- ly situated by large wall maps and contextu- alized with wall labels. Additional copies of the label text were provided in folders, color coded to match the geographical areas. The exhibition catalogue included Roy's essay along with lush color plates and black- and-white photos of each object accompanied by historical and cultural information, often from obscure sources. This section of the cata- logue in particular will be an important resource for years to come; scholars can only continue to add layers of meaning to the texts surrounding the objects. The 1999 PASALA (Project for the Ad- vanced Study of Art and Life in Africa) con- ference at the University of Iowa, which was titled "Crosscurrents: Art and Power in East- ern Africa," coincided with the opening of "Kilengi" at the university's museum and was greatly enhanced by the strong presentation of East African art in the Bareiss collection. The conference provided an invaluable cross- disciplinary forum for a dialogue surround- ing issues of East African art, archaeology, film, musical traditions, and popular culture. One can only hope that conferences such as this one and exhibitions such as "Kilengi" will lay the groundwork so that the arts of East and Southern Africa will be celebrated for the richness of their traditions rather than mar- ginalized as unique.
