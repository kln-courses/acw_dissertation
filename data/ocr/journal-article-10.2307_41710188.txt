<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rock Art in the Casas Grandes Region: Report of Seven New Sites and a Review of the Literature Richard D. O'Connor and Walter P. Parks The archaeology of Northwest Mexico has received considerable atten- tion since publication of the eight- volume Joint Expedition report of the excavation of Paquimé, the central city of the Casas Grandes culture (Di Peso 1974; Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner 1974). By comparison, the rock art of this region has received far less attention (Mendiola Galván 2002). The purpose of this paper is to review previous reports and add seven new sites to the literature on rock art in the Casas Grandes region. Adolph Bandelier was the first to report the existence of rock art in northern Chihuahua. In the spring of 1884, he explored Paquimé and the surrounding area and kept a detailed daily journal of what he saw. On May 30, 1884, he climbed to the ruins on Cerro Moctezuma, the prominent sentinel peak between Paquimé and Mata Ortiz. En route, he recorded written descriptions and drawings of two rock art sites. After his death, his wife donated his journals to the Fray Angélico Chávez History Library in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Bandelier's journals for 1882-1884 were published in 1970 (Lange and Riley 1970). The editors of this four-volume work chose to elide certain material present in the original journals, but marked these omissions with an asterisk in the text. Regarding the rock art, they included only Bandelier's writ- ten descriptions and an asterisk referencing his drawings. Tomás Jaehn, library curator, provided us with scans from Bandelier's original journal. Shown in figure 1 are the sketches Bandelier made on the day he first saw the rock art in 1884. These are the first illustrations of rock art in northern Chihuahua. Richard D. O'connor is a physician in San Diego, California, and is the director of quality for Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group. He is a connoisseur of Mata Ortiz pottery. Walter P. Parks is the author of the book The Miracle of Mata Ortiz and has a twenty-seven-year association with the potters of Mata Ortiz.

(Provided by Tomas Jaehn and published with permission of the Fray Angélico Chavez History Library) Bandelier described the sketch labeled #1 as a shield with ornaments. Sketch #2, not commented upon in his journal, is clearly a bird, possibly a macaw, known to be important in the Casas Grandes culture. It may be a pictograph because the label seems to indicate that the images in #2 are black and ginger yellow. Sketch #3, termed a horseshoe in his journal, might represent the concentric circles so common in rock art with the bottom portion eroded away. Although Bandelier left what appears to be a detailed description of his outing on Cerro Moctezuma, no one yet has identified the sites. Norwegian ethnographer Carl Lumholtz was the first to publish images of rock art in the Casas Grandes region. During his explorations in 1891 he recorded rock art in Valle de las Cuevas (Cave Valley) and adjacent areas in the Sierra Madre Occidental west of Paquimé. These images (figure 2), taken from Unknown Mexico (1902) are probably the first ever reproductions of rock art, both pictographs and petroglyphs, in</page><page sequence="3">Rock Art in the Casas Grandes Region &lt;■ 11 northern Chihuahua. An elderly Mormon gentleman identified as Mr. Nelson brought the existence of these sites to Lumholtz's attention. Local knowledge provided by Mormon families became a common means of locating rock art sites, of which Lumholtz's contact with Mr. Nelson is the first example (Lumholtz 1902). After Lumholtz, archaeological research in the region was sporadic for more than half a century. In 1958 the Casas Grandes Joint Expedition, Figure 2. Lumholtz, 1902. cosponsored by the Amerind Foundation and the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia and led by Dr. Charles Di Peso, began an exten- sive excavation of the Paquimé site. The voluminous 1974 report of this landmark project recorded two rock art sites: CHICH:C:12:3, labeled "Tapiacitas," and CHIH:C:15:23, labeled "Casas Grandes Pictographs." No images were published or any other information about the art provided. CHIH:C: 15:23 is the same site Arnold Withers reported on briefly in 1976. Withers placed the site north of Zaragoza, a community known locally as Willy, along the Piedras Verdes River on a ranch owned by Albert Whetten, member of a well-established Mormon family in the area. The images shown in figures 3a and 3b are from the Withers report. Eric Kaldahl of the Amerind Foundation provided us scans of unpub- lished slides of CHIH:C: 15:23 that Di Peso and colleagues took during</page><page sequence="4">12 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Figures 3 A and 3B. Withers. (Used with permission of the Archaeological Society of New Mexico )</page><page sequence="5">Rock Art in the Casas Grandes Region -ř 13 the original exploration. These scans indicate clearly that it is the same site reported by Withers. Polly Schaasfma, perhaps the leading expert on Southwest rock art, indicated that the site is south of Willy, not north as Withers stated in his report. Dr. Kaldahl reviewed the original site records for CHIH:C: 15:23 and a file of correspondence between Withers and Gloria Fenner. It is clear from those documents that CHIH:C: 15:23 labeled "Casas Grandes Pictographs" is north of Willy. This was con- firmed by a former owner of the ranch, Jay Whetten of Colonia Juárez (personal communication, 2011). No photos have been published of the rock art at Tapiacitas, the other site reported by Di Peso, but Whalen and Minnis (2009) published sketches of cuadros found there. Polly Schaasfma was not able to visit this site but was shown a photo of the site by Manuel Olivas of Casas Grandes and included it in her report (Schaasfma 1998). John Davis, a frequent traveler to and explorer of Chihuahua and a great friend of the potters of Mata Ortiz, accompanied members of the El Paso Archaeological Society on expeditions to Cave Valley. He investigated eighteen caves and reported his findings at the Thirteenth Regional Archaeological Symposium for Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas in 1978. He described rock art, primarily pictographs, in four caves. He noted pictographs on the walls of structures in Cueva de la Olla and on the walls of the other three caves. Lumholtz had discovered these latter caves in 1891 and described them as burial caves. They are located along the Piedras Verdes River on the side opposite La Cueva de la Olla and downstream of it. Davis noted that the figures reproduced in Lumholtz's report were taken from one of these caves. The figures Davis drew leave no doubt that this is the Lumholtz site. Ron Bridge - mon provided a photo of this rock art and reports that it is in Cueva de la Golondrina (see figure 4). Davis also described one additional rock panel farther downstream, with petroglyphs bearing no similarity to the pictographs found in the four caves (Davis 1978). In the summer of 1982, Renée Opperman visited rock art sites in the Casas Grandes region and presented her findings at the First Annual Rock Art Symposium at the San Diego Museum of Man (Opperman 1983). She described four sites but provided images from only one. The five pictures were taken at the site she described as "Petroglyph Canyon" but more commonly known now as Arroyo de los Monos. Hers is the first report of rock art in the arroyo. In recent years this site has become a tourist attraction for those willing to brave the rough roads to the canyon.</page><page sequence="6">14 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Figure 4. La Cueva de la Golondrina, first described by Lumholtz. (Photograph by Ron Bridgemon) Polly Schaafsma, accompanied by Francisco Mendiola Galván, made extensive exploratory trips to Chihuahua in 1994 and 1996 (Schaafsma 1997, 1998). She recorded thirteen sites and proposed a classification system based upon chronology and stylistic characteristics: the Chihua- huan Polychrome style and the Candelaria style, assigned to the late Archaic Period; the Jornada style and the Paquimé style, attributed to the late prehistoric farming period; and lastly the Conchos style in the historic period. Six of the sites Schaafsma visited were assigned to the Paquimé style: La Angostura, Arroyo de los Monos (Opperman's Petroglyph Canyon), Anchondo, La Cienguita, the Arroyo Seco Ranch Gate, and El Águila. Examples of the Paquimé-style art in these sites are shown in figures 5-10. The Paquimé style was assigned to sites she did not visit: the one reported by Withers, Davis, and Lumholtz, and Di Peso's Tapia- citas site. A fortified hill in west central Chihuahua described by Sayles (1936) and sites reported by Guevara (1986, 1991) were also classified as Paquimé style.</page><page sequence="7">Figure 5. Anchondo.

Report of Seven New Sites We now consider seven previously unreported rock art sites in the Casas Grandes region of northern Chihuahua. Juan Quezada, the famous Mata Ortiz ceramic artist, showed us the first site, located in an unnamed canyon in the Arroyo Seco drainage. Polly Schaasfma previously reported a rock art site at the gate to the Arroyo Seco Ranch, located south of Paquimé. Our previously unreported rock art is however located several kilometers beyond the gate in a side canyon to the Arroyo Seco. There are trincheras on the hills along the arroyo, and there is an ancient village with approximately eight to ten rooms on the bench adjacent to the entrance to this side canyon. Obvious pothunting has taken place at this site and numerous surface sherds are present. The entrance to the canyon is seen in figure 1 1 . The rock art is found scat-</page><page sequence="12">20 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest Figure 11. Arroyo Seco side canyon entrance. tered at various locations on the walls of the canyon, with the first site approximately half a kilometer from the ruins and the last about two kilometers from them. The first image may be a deer with well-defined mouth and antlers (figure 12). The additional horn that curves forward is reminiscent of the horn seen on water serpent imagery. Other images in this canyon include circles, cuadros (square forms), abstract linear forms, human stick figures, and more deer. These images are located on noncontiguous wall sites (figures 13-20). Jim Jarvis, a third- generation descendent of one the pioneering Mor- mon families of the region, showed us the second and third sites. They are located west of Paquimé in the Sierra Madre Occidental along creeks that drain into the Piedras Verdes River. These streams are locally known as Garcia Creek and Pacheco Creek, but these names do not appear on topographic maps. Both of these new sites lie west of the El Águila site reported by Polly Schaasfma and south of the sites reported by Lumholtz and Withers in the Cave Valley region. The Garcia Creek site, first visited in 2002, has numerous abstract images. One rock wall in particular is crowded with them. In figure 21 Jim Jarvis stands adjacent to this wall. Images include cuadros, volutes</page><page sequence="13">Figure 12. Arroyo Seco Ranch side canyon .</page><page sequence="14">Figure 13.

Additional images are found on other walls along Garcia Creek (figures 24-26). This site was revisited in 2010 and found to be under- water due to recent construction of a dam across a narrow part of the creek (figure 27). The photos taken in 2002 may be the only record of this site. A small prehistoric archaeological site consisting of surface masonry rooms and a typical artifact scatter is located on the hill above the creek, and may be associated with the petroglyphs. During the 2010 visit, Richard Ryan discovered a macaw pen enclosure stone at this site, indicating that the prehistoric inhabitants at this site kept domesticated macaws. Fortunately, the dam does not endanger these ruins, but numer- ous holes suggest that pothunting has occurred. The Pacheco Creek site lies on the creek that is labeled Piedras Verdes on topographical maps. People who live in the area call this section of the river Pacheco Creek and consider the confluence of Pacheco and Garcia creeks to be the origin of the Piedras Verdes River. The site is notable for its pictographs including some quite complex cuadros and linked triangles (figures 28-30). The fourth site consists of a single rock located in the hills above and east of Mata Ortiz on Juan Quezada's ranch. The people who live in</page><page sequence="21">Figure 22.

Adjacent to the human figure is an abstract geometric figure (figures 31 and 32). This is the only site not immediately adjacent to water. The significance of this is uncertain. Ron Bridgemon brought the fifth site to our attention. It is located immediately adjacent to the old Ferrocarril Noroeste de México (FNM) rail bed approximately twenty- three kilometers south of Mata Ortiz. A large wall contains numerous abstract designs and bird and human fig- ures (figures 33-35). The FNM site has been subjected to defacement by graffiti. The rail bed was laid down in 1910-1911, and there is one graffito dated 1923 evident in figure 34. Meredith Romney, a prominent leader of the Mormon community in Chihuahua, guided us to two other sites. Both sites are located southwest of Janos in the vicinity of his ranch. Site 6 consists of three caves in the Arroyo Carcay. The caves are large with ceilings and walls blackened by soot. Water was present in the arroyo in February 2011. The caves are located within three hundred meters of each other. The size of the caves can be appreciated by viewing Meredith Romney standing at the edge of the middle cave (figure 36). Pictographs were found in all three caves but those in the middle cave were most impressive (figures 37 and 38). It is possible that there are other pictographs or petroglyphs now obscured by the soot. The pictograph designs in these three caves do not appear to be similar to the classic Paquimé style. The seventh site is located along the San Pedro River and is known locally as Las Letras because of the petroglyphs. The San Pedro generally flows year-round. In contrast to the Arroyo Carcay pictographs, this site features petroglyphs that seem to be consistent with Paquimé style. Most of the petroglyphs were found on a large outcrop of rock immediately adjacent to the river (figure 39), but there were others on a second outcrop approximately eighty meters away from the river. The rock art consists of abstract and anthropomorphic designs (figures 40-43). These seven sites supplement those reported by Polly Schaasfma, and we have tentatively identified six of them as Paquimé style. The excep- tion is the Arroyo Carcay pictographs, which do not seem typical of classic Casas Grandes designs. Schaasfma also identified the Withers site as Paquimé style, along with a site she did not visit, Tapiacitas. The six Paquimé sites reported here bring the number of Paquimé-style sites to at least fourteen. These sites collectively contain a substantial number of images.</page><page sequence="27">rißure 30.

These newly identified sites contain many images, both realistic and abstract. Some of the abstract figures appear to be entoptic images, which have been attributed to visual disturbances that occur during hallucina- tory or trancelike events. Similar abstract figures are found in rock art in numerous locations around the world. They may reflect underlying changes in brain physiology that are common to all people and are not culture specific (Carr 1995). Some images in these Paquimé-style sites clearly can be categorized as entoptic, whereas others seem culture specific. Given the expansion in the number of sites and the resultant increase in individual images, analytic comparisons with other cultures in the American Southwest and Mexican Northwest may be feasible. Unfortunately, these rock art sites are endangered. Natural processes such as erosion and weathering are evident, but more alarming changes</page><page sequence="36">44 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest have taken and are taking place. Graffiti was evident at virtually all the sites we visited, even very remote ones, and the newly constructed dam completely inundated the rock art found along Garcia Creek. Documenta- tion of these scarce archaeological resources takes on new significance and urgency. Numerous arroyos, creeks, and canyons located near Paquimé and in the rugged Sierra Madre have not been explored. It is likely that tucked into these remote locations are more sites that additional inves- tigation will bring to light, "fr Acknowledgments A portion of this article was presented at the 31st Annual Conference of the American Rock Art Research Association, in Nuevo Casas Grandes, 2004.
