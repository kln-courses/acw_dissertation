<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Arabic Commentary of Yefet ben 'Ali the Karaite on the Book of Hosea. Edited from manuscripts and provided with critical notes and an introduc- tion by Philip Birnbaum, Ph.D. A thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy in the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning. Philadelphia. 1942. Pp. lxii+247. As the author states on p. vii, n. 1 "except for a few additions contained in the following pages, this introduction originally appeared in the Jewish Quarterly Review, N. S., XXXII, Nos. 1, 2, 3, in the form of an article entitled "Yefet Ben All and his Influence on Biblical Exegesis." This introduc- tion consists of two pages of biographical interest, devotes a few pages to a general examination of Yefet's manner of exegesis, and then ably traces (p. xi) some of Yefet's comments on Hosea to the Targum, Talmud and Midrash. In his treatment of Mu'tazilite influences on Yefet the author should have been more cautious, as it is very hazardous to attempt to evolve systems for Bible commentators who have left behind no special philosophical treatises, on the basis of disjointed, fragmentary and often contradictory statements. Thus, for example, Birnbaum's claim that Yefet was under Mu'tazilite influence in his explanations of anthropomorphic passages, while ascribing Se'adyah's similar treatment of the same passages to the influence of the Targumim, should be modified. Exaggerated also is the statement (p. v) to the effect that "one is almost tempted to believe that there would be little left of Ibn Ezra and IKimhi if we were to discard from their respective Bible commentaries what was earlier uttered by their eminent forerunner, the now relatively obscure and forgotten Yefet." No one can deny Yefet's influence on Bible exegesis. Yet, one might ask himself what would be left of Yefet were we to apply to his commentaries this same procrustian method. Suffice it to point here to the quotations in the present work about Yefet's dependence on teachers and exegetes, and Birnbaum's own conclusions (p. ix) "that Yefet's biblical commentary, although it claims numerous original interpretations, is in the main a compilation into which the author has con- densed the exegetic erudition of his predecessors." 37</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The rest of the introduction is taken up with discussions of Yefet's style and method of exegesis, of the Haggadic allusion (p. xxvii) to his comments on Hosea 12 4-.5, of Yefet's polemics against Rabbinic Judaism, of a few typical examples of Yefet's interpretations, and of his pedantic translation of the Hebrew text. This part of the introduction closes with a discussion of the deviations in Yefet's Hosea from classical Arabic, a subject which in the opinion of the reviewer could be dealt with only after an examination of the preserved remnants of Yefet mss. in Arabic naskhi script, some of which date back to Yefet's own lifetime. For, aside from new coinages and devia- tions in meaning, all other analyses are not definitive while we lack the criteria with which to distinguish between the peculiarities of the author and the slips, errors, and sometimes deliberate changes of the copyists, and assign each his particular share of grammatical or syntactical non-classicisms. The section dealing with Yefet's widespread influence on Bible exegesis in Christian countries, and especially the pages devoted to Yefet's influence on Abraham Ibn Ezra and on David Kimhi, deserve much praise, as do the numerous parallels to the Targum, Se'adyah, David b. Abraham al-Fasi, Ibn Janah, Ibn Balaam, Rashi, and others. But in his treatment of the Hebrew fragment of Yefet's commentary, published by T6ttermann, Weis- sagungen Hoseas, etc. (=T) the author leans too heavily upon his learned predecessors in this field (p. xxxviii), especially on the question of the existence or non-existence of several recensions of Yefet. That the T fragment "does not precisely agree with the original" in several passages is quite under- standable when we take into account the slight divergencies among the numerous Arabic manuscripts themselves, and when we bear in mind that the Hebrew translator based his translation on but one Arabic ms., not on a critically edited text. There is no need to assume the existence of several recensions of Yefet's works, when the carelessness of scribes and copyists and the many difficulties encountered in the transcription of Arabic (un- vocalized naskhi) into Hebrew script sufficiently account for such and other minor differences, occasional omissions of a phrase, or additions of a gloss. It may also be of interest to mention here that the reviewer's studies in this field have convinced him that the T fragment is not the only one of its kind, and that we are fortunate in possessing a complete Hebrew translation of a commentary by Yefet exhibiting the characteristics of the T fragment. In the Livre d'Hommage a la Memoire du Dr. Samuel Poznanski, Varsovie, 1927, Markon published a onl, 1p l:w ',pri pn i nln I y ITrm, pp. n'y-n"' 38</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS (=M), a Hebrew translation of Yefet's Arabic commentary on Ruth which he mistakenly ascribed to Salmon b. Yerubim, Yefet's older Karaite con- temporary B ble commentator, following the superscription to that unique ms. A comparison of M with the original Yefet as edited by Nahum Schor- stein Der Commentar des Karders Jephet ben 'Ali zum Buche Ruth, Berlin, 1903, chapters 1 and 2, leaves no doubt as to its authorship. The unpublished portions of the same ms., which the reviewer was permitted to examine thanks to the liberality of the Columbia University Library, exhibited the same characteristics for the other megilloth. Knowing the spirit of the times and the laborious piety of those generations one may readily assume the translation of many if not all of Yefet's commentaries into Hebrew. For the use and edification of the growing center of Byzantian Jewry there existed also Jacob b. Reuben's commentary entitled nvyn Imn, which Dr. Birnbaum (following all authorities) regards as "a Hebrew compilation of Yefet's commentary" reproduced "in a very condensed form." Insofar, however, as the published portion of Jacob's commentary is concerned (i. e. beginning with Jeremiah), the reviewer is of the opinion that Jacob b. Reuben was an epitomizer, not a compiler. The reviewer further believes that these so-called eclectic commentaries are in reality condensations of the earlier and complete Hebrew translations of Yefet's commentaries, such as T and M, and are not based upon Yefet's Arabic original. To be sure, we do encounter slight variations here and there between the epitome and the complete trans- lation, but these too, as previously stated, are to be regarded as nothing un- usual in editions based on single and often mutilated mss. Furthermore, not all of Jacob's epitomes are condensations of the Hebrew translations of Yefet's Arabic works. With the material at hand the reviewer has so far established (and hopes to be able to publish it soon) the fact that in addition to T and M, or Minor Prophets and Ruth, Jacob's Job is also based on, or culled from, Yefet. There are, however, epitomes by Jacob for which the underlying Hebrew prototypes were original Arabic commentaries by others than Yefet. Such is the case with the Book of Proverbs, and for reasons un- known to the reviewer. These restrictions, however, are not in the least a reflection upon Yefet's widespread influence, but attest more fully to the esteem in which Jacob b. Reuben held Yefet, in that he epitomized him ex- clusively for many biblical books, and not, as has been heretofore assumed by scholars, that Yefet formed but one- although the main- source for Jacob. Incidentally, the assumption of the existence of a complete set of Hebrew translations of Yefet's (and perhaps of others) Arabic commentaries, 39</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE would obviate the necessity of determining the exact amount of Arabic knowledge possessed by commentators in Christian countries. In the following section (pp. L ff.) Birnbaum establishes Yefet's author- ship of the anonymous Bodleian Codex Huntington 206, and although his thesis in the main is sound, the reviewer wishes to reserve an appreciation of it for some other occasion. The introduction closes with a description in outline of the eight mss., complete and fragmentary, which the editor used and with a page describing his method of editing. Now, during the last decade or so, a few Judeo-Arabic texts of great im- portance have been published in this country, and although each one of those editions has its merits, there is no doubt that the method followed by Skoss in his edition of the K. Jdmi' al-Alfaz is the soundest of them all, as it takes cognizance of textual deviations from the classical Arabic while re- taining the readings of the mss. themselves. Furthermore, since Judeo-Arabic does have its peculiarities, internal evidence rather than dictionary forms should be the decisive element in establishing doubtful readings. Guided by this internal evidence, the reviewer wishes to append here a few corrections to the text. P. 3, 11. 2, 20, etc. 'R:mv2, but p. 2, 1. 14, etc., correctly 'nitY'.

Such redundant (but no sense yielding) phrases are well-known to the student of old texts, and usually arise as a compromise combination of two readings such as nHKm D3 and 3't ntrt, or through the inclusion in a subsequent copy of an originally overdotted 1D7 or 'lz: to indicate an error.
