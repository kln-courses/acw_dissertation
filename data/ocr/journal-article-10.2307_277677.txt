PENDERGAST ABSTRACT Metal artifacts are discussed as possible indicators of relationships within Mesoamerica and between Meso- america and the American Southwest. All known forms of Mesoamerican metal artifacts for which age and provenience data are available are included in a typologi- cal classification, presented as a basis for comparisons and distribution studies. Data on spatial and temporal distribution, with indications of centers of manufacture or use of some types, and with suggested maximum tem- poral range for each type, are included with the typologi- cal classification. Based on these data, a series of sugges- tions is presented regarding time of initial appearance of metals in various subareas of Mesoamerica, the impor- tance of certain subareas as centers from which metals diffused, and patterns and rates of diffusion within Meso- america and between Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. THE PRESENCE in prehispanic Mesoamer- ica of a widespread and diversified metal- working industry has long excited the interest of archaeologists. Although Mesoamerican metal working rarely attained the degree of technological development found elsewhere in Central and South America, the variety of dis- tinctive objects produced, the restricted dis- tribution of many types of artifacts, and the comparatively short time span involved have combined to make metal artifacts of prime in- terest in Mesoamerican archaeology. Attempts at analysis and comparison of metal artifacts from recent excavations at Amapa, Nayarit (Pendergast 1962) have underscored the difficulties encountered in the use of exist- ing classifications, and have formed the basis of the studies presented here. Initial examina- tion of the problem indicated that, while some regional studies such as those of Lothrop (1952) and Aguilar (1946) existed, there was clearly a need for a broad typological classification which could provide a basis for comparison of metal artifacts throughout Mesoamerica, as well as for distributional analyses. From such anal- yses we might expect to be able to derive con- clusions regarding time and area of initial ap- pearance of various types of metal artifacts, area or areas of introduction of metal working in Mesoamerica, patterns of diffusion of specific artifact types, definition of possible time mark- ers, and recognition of relationships among cultures in Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. Mesoamerican metal artifacts have, in the past, been analyzed from several points of view. A number of studies, notably those of Arsan- daux and Rivet (1921, 1923; Rivet and Arsan- daux 1946), Bergsoe (1937, 1938), and Clement (1935), have been aimed at reconstruction of the processes employed in the smelting of metals and the production of artifacts. Hend- richs (1940-41) and Martinez Gracida (1897) have combined studies of production with anal- yses of mining techniques. These aspects of Mesoamerican metal working have been ex- tensively dealt with, and neither is a major con- sideration in the present study. Several analyses have combined data on pro- duction with descriptions, and occasionally comparisons, of metal artifacts from various Mesoamerican archaeological sites. Among these are the work of Aguilar (1946), Putnam (1883), Saville (1920), Squier (1851), Valen- tini (1879), the several technical analyses by McLeod (1937, 1945, 1949) and Root (1947, 1953), and, most recently, the studies by Easby (1956a, 1956b, 1957). Limited comparative studies have also been included in a number of excavation reports, such as those of Lothrop (1952) for the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza and of Woodbury and Trik (1953) for the site of Zaculeu, the former including also a limited typological classification. From this wide range of studies, we now pos- sess a considerable fund of knowledge of tech- niques of production of metal artifacts in Meso- america. A large body of data on the range of artifacts manufactured can also be gleaned from these studies and from excavation reports. The primary aim of this paper is the presenta- tion of a typological framework which will al- low re-ordering and re-examination of the data already available, in the hope of providing a basis for realization of the several results enu- merated above. For purposes of the present study, metal arti- facts are defined as including only those ob- jects which were cast or hammered from smelted ore. Excluded from consideration are objects such as beads of native metal and mir- rors of iron pyrites, since the technique in- volved in their production is essentially the 520</page><page sequence="2">METAL IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA same as that used in working other stone. Ob- jects made from ochre are also excluded. The concept of heirarchical ordering of mate- rials employed in the typological classification is a revision of Gifford's (1940, 1947) approach. For purposes of clarity, three larger categories have been added to the system: utilitarian ob- jects, objects of personal adornment, and cere- monial objects. The latter two overlap to some extent, but most of the artifacts fall clearly into one of the three groups. The criteria used in distinguishing types and subtypes vary within the three major groups, because of the nature of the materials. Thus, utilitarian objects are classified largely on the basis of apparent use, while artifacts in the re- maining two groups are in most cases separated into types by form, and into subtypes by decora- tion. While it may be argued with reason that this method of classification does not produce comparable types and subtypes, there seems to be no other valid basis for distinguishing sub- divisions of the larger categories. Furthermore, the apparent problems raised by such a system do not seem to affect either the distributional analyses or the inferences drawn from them. Within the major categories, each class of artifacts (for example, needles, knives, bells, plaques) is designated by an upper case Roman numeral. Subdivision of the class results in types of various orders of difference. Subclasses or general types are represented by upper case let- ters, specific types by Arabic numerals, subtypes by lower case letters, and further subdivisions, where they exist, by lower case Roman nu- merals. The arrangement of the numerals and letters always clearly records the hierarchical breakdown of the classification. Except for a few large and heterogeneous classes, such as bells, information on metals used in manufac- ture, provenience of specimens, and temporal and spatial distribution is included for each of the types or subclass groupings. In larger classes, these data are provided only for types or subtypes, in order to avoid repetition. Data on range of dimensions of artifacts have not been included, due to lack of such information for many specimens. Dating employed in this study is based upon the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation of the Maya and Christian calendars, a correla- tion which seems, on the basis of the recent work of Satterthwaite and Ralph (1960), to be much more acceptable than that of Spinden. Since chronological placement of many sites yielding metal artifacts is based on shaky evi- dence, the temporal placement of some types, even with the broad span indicated, is subject to question. However, although absolute dating of types is far from precise, suggested relative chronological relationships appear to have some value, and can probably be taken as essentially accurate. Both the typology and the distributio'hal studies are susceptible to several types of error apart from simple failure to include all avail- able data. One such error arises from omission of many artifact types known to exist in mu- seums and private collections, but noSincluded due to lack of data on provenience and age. Omission for these reasons extends to some forms classified by Aguilar (1946). Because of these intentional omissions, the classification and the studies based on it are not fully representative of Mesoamerican metal working. However, it must be noted that the typology is presented as an ordering device to facilitate study of distribution and dating of metal artifacts. Therefore, artifacts with a hazy date and little better than a guess as to proven- ience have virtually no place in this study. Also excluded from consideration are data contained in documentary sources. While ac- counts of early chroniclers have provided the basis for a number of excellent discussions of prehispanic metallurgy, the type of information offered by such sources is of little value here. Similarly, discussions of evidence for the presence of metals at sites from which no metal artifacts have been recovered, such as Acosta's note on the situation at Tula (Acosta 1956- 57: 94) and Lowe's brief discussion of the Ruiz site, Chiapas (Lowe 1959: 31-2), have not been considered in the typology or the distributional studies. Such analyses, like discussions in docu- mentary sources, should serve as stimuli to fu- ture investigations, which may be expected to extend the distribution, and perhaps the range of types, of metal artifacts in Mesoamerica. Although it becomes clear at first examina- tion that metal working in Mesoamerica traces its ultimate origin to similar, but often more complex, developments to the south, it has proved impossible to include here a detailed discussion of metallurgy in Central and South America. Consideration of these areas as bases for trade and stimulus diffusion to Mesoamerica is, of necessity, limited to general statements. 521 PENDERGAST ]</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Sites yielding information included in the analyses are listed by area in Table 1. In sev- eral instances, sites have been listed despite lack of descriptive data on metal artifacts in excavation reports. These sites are, for the most part, considered only in general discussions and in plotting distributions of metals without refer- ence to artifact types. The locations of all sites used in the study are plotted in Figure 1. In addition, distributions of selected artifact types and idealized representations of all types in the classification (Figs. 2-16) supplement the text. Discussions of spatial and temporal distribu- tion include a listing of areas of occurrence, ap- parent centers of occurrence or manufacture in some cases, and suggested maximum possible temporal range for each type, as well as indica- tions of differences in time of appearance and duration of use for forms appearing in more than one area.

CONCLUSIONS One of the primary concerns of this study has been the establishment of the time and area of first appearance of metals in Mesoamerica. This problem has proved to be less easily resolved than initially supposed; however, the emergence of a more or less consistent pattern of temporal relationships allows some reasonably certain statements regarding the introduction of metals in Mesoamerica. The data do not identify a single point in space which can be defined as the site of initial introduction of metals to Mesoamerica; rather, they suggest that nearly simultaneous introduc- tion occurred in two widely separated areas. Analysis of metal artifacts from Amapa, Nay- arit (Pendergast 1962), as well as those from Apatzingan, Michoacan, indicates that metal artifacts appeared on the West Coast of Mexico as early as 900, and that shortly after this date there existed in this area a well-developed metal-working industry, producing a variety of metal objects. At the same time, or at most only slightly earlier, metals made their first ap- pearance in the Southern Maya area. Since transmission of metal objects from the Southern Maya area to West Mexico in the space of 25 or 50 years seems highly unlikely, we are forced to turn to Central America as the source of both early Mesoamerican occurrences. Willey's discussion (1955: 584-5) of sporadic sea trade between Central America and West Mexico may point to one possible means of introduction of metals to West Mexico. The concept of dual introduction of metals into Mesoamerica at the beginning of the 10th century of the Christian era disregards the sug- gestions made by Sorenson (1954a, 1954b; com- pare Smith 1955) that metals were in use in early Classic or Preclassic times. The instances cited by Sorenson (1954a, 1954b: 3, 6-7) of representations in clay of what may be metal bells, and of the recovery at Cuicuilco of a fragment of sheet copper accompanied by sev- eral copper nails, dated at about 350-650, all seem suspect in the light of the present study. The former instances, it must be admitted, may indicate knowledge of metal artifacts in some areas of Mesoamerica prior to 900, although no metals have been recovered from the sites in question. It seems likely that the so-called "bell" necklaces on clay figurines reflect an idea which was not extended to production of the metal objects themselves. Lacking metal artifacts at the sites, we can only conclude that, if the figurines do represent individuals wear- ing necklaces of metal bells, the representations are of objects neither produced nor used at the sites. The Cuicuilco material, which is associ- ated with very early deposits, is highly suspect, particularly due to the presence of nails with the sheet copper. Somewhat less questionable is the metal re- covered at Copan, which seems to be Classic in date. The association of two fragments of a gold figurine with a dated stela certainly sug- gests that metal was present in northern Hon- duras by Classic times. However, Baker (1962) questions the validity of the association of the substela cache with the stela date, and recent work at Tikal (Coe 1962) suggests the re-use of both cache area and stelae. The style of the figurine legs suggests that they are of Central American origin, and that they were traded into Copan. This find should, therefore, be con- sidered as probably the earliest instance of trade of metals into Mesoamerica, but certainly not as the beginning of metal working in areas north of Central America. The statements made with regard to Copan may apply equally to the materials from the site of Tazumal, El Salvador, which are prob- ably also of Central American origin. Here, however, the appearance of metals does not seem earlier than 850, somewhat later than the Copan find. The temporal placement of metals at a num- ber of sites may have been obscured by the tentative nature of chronologies established in many areas. For this reason, dates assigned to artifact types in the distribution and summary sections of this study should be regarded as indicating the maximum possible range. In most of the areas studied, the initial dates are probably too early; only in West and Northern Mexico and the American Southwest are dates for first appearance of metals reasonably cer- tain. Further problems in dating are created by the tendency of many archaeologists to as- sign any complex including metals to the Post- classic period. This tendency, coupled with reluctance, in some cases, to suggest more pre- cise placement within the Postclassic, leaves dates for many complexes open to suspicion. 534 [ VOL. 27, No. 4, 1962</page><page sequence="16">METAL IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA Whether or not there are errors in dating of some complexes, it is clear that the differ- ences in time of first appearance of metal arti- facts in Mesoamerica are not of great magni- tude, even in areas widely separated. We are led to conclude, therefore, that, although both the stimulus and the artifacts themselves may have reached Mesoamerica in isolated instances by as early as 500, the first major introduction of the concept of metal working must have taken place in both the Southern Maya area and in West Mexico at the beginning of the 10th century. Acceptance was apparently ex- tremely rapid, for by 1000 or 1050, metals were spread throughout Mesoamerica, and by about 1100 they made their first appearance in the American Southwest. Simultaneous introduction of metals in West Mexico and the Southern Maya area suggests that both areas functioned as centers of dif- fusion of metal artifacts in Mesoamerica. The presence at Amapa of a diversified collection of metal artifacts indicates the status of this site, and probably of West Mexico in general, as a metallurgical center, thus bearing out Willey's (1955: 585) identification of West Mexico as a possible center of a well-developed metal- working tradition. Although the direction and nature of diffusion remains unclear in some cases, it is possible to point to a quantity of specific data which suggest transmission of traits from these two centers, as well as from other subareas of Mesoamerica. Each of the subareas of Mesoamerica seems to have spread influence to, and received in- fluence from, several other subareas. By analyz- ing the pattern of relationships in each subarea, we can arrive at a reasonably coherent series of conclusions regarding the diffusion of metal working throughout Mesoamerica. Central Mexico appears to have derived its early metal artifacts from the south; most of the types found in this area also occur in South- ern Mexico or in the Maya area. It is likely that trade or stimulus diffusion began quite early between the Southern Maya and areas to the north, extending ultimately to Central Mexico. It is even conceivable that the initial introduction of metals in the Southern Maya area was accompanied by more extensive con- tacts between Central American groups and Southern and Central Mexican cultures. Which- ever was the case, transmission from the south was extremely rapid, resulting in the appear- ance of metals in Central Mexico by about 975 or 1000 at the latest. This trend of in- fluence from the south seems to have been re- versed in later times; at least one type of knife (Type VIIA) appears first in Central Mexico, and subsequently in Southern Mexico, where its use was much more widespread. It is possible that, at a very early date, trade was being carried on between West and Cen- tral Mexico. There is evidence that materials were being traded from the Valley of Mexico to Amapa by about 900, and there is no reason to suppose that reciprocal trade might not have included some metal artifacts. The greater proximity of Southern Mexico to the Central area makes trade or diffusion from the south a more attractive possibility, but we cannot, on the basis of typological or temporal data, rule out West Mexico as a source of some Cen- tral Mexican metal objects, and of some of the stimuli to production of metal artifacts in the Central area. Although Central Mexico was certainly a center of the metal-working industry for some time prior to the Conquest, archaeological evi- dence from the area does not indicate such a status in earlier times. However, Lothrop (1952: 109), basing his suggestion on metallo- graphic and stylistic data, suggests that many artifacts from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chi- chen Itza are of Central Mexican origin. Sev- eral of the bell types noted by Lothrop (1952: 108) as of Central Mexican origin have not as yet been recovered in Central Mexican archae- ological sites. However, the high frequency of uncontrolled excavation in the area leaves open the possibility that the artifacts may have been found, but not reported. A single artifact type, a nose ornament (Type VA), appears only in Central Mexico; while several other types are undoubtedly of local manufacture, none seems to have centered in the area. This lack of metals in a region known to have been rich in metal artifacts in the 16th century is probably due largely to poor report- ing of excavated materials, and to extensive destruction of sites by untrained excavators, with the more elaborate artifacts often disap- pearing into private collections. In Central Mexico, as in some other areas, both distribu- tional and temporal data are probably badly skewed by quality of excavation and reporting. West Mexico, in contrast to the Central area, has been the scene of a number of well-con- 535 PENDERGAST ]</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY trolled excavations, many of which have re- vealed a variety of metal artifacts. This area seems to have been the site of a very early in- troduction of metals into Mesoamerica, and probably functioned as a center of diffusion to other areas. The possibility of trade between West and Central Mexico has been noted; an instance of trade in the opposite direction can be noted in the occurrence of a single pyriform bell (Type ID4a) at Amapa, which may have reached the site from somewhere in the Cen- tral area, where the form seems somewhat earlier. Less distinctive forms, such as needles, cannot be traced with certainty to a single source. Judging from the early date of some forms at Amapa, however, it is logical to as- sume that trade or stimulus diffusion from this area of Nayarit may account for other appear- ances in West Mexico, as well perhaps as some in Central and Northern Mexico (Pendergast 1962). The occurrence of several forms, including fishhooks (Type IXA1), bells (Types IAla-i, ICla, IC2a, IDla), and axes (Type IVA) in Northern Mexico slightly later than in West Mexico, plus the geographic proximity of the two areas, suggests that West Mexico, and per- haps specifically the site of Amapa and neigh- boring sites in Nayarit and Sinaloa, may have been the area of origin of many artifact types found in Northern Mexico. The northern area may also have served as a corridor of diffusion of traits from West Mexico to the American Southwest, where bells (Types IAla-i, IASa) appear some 200 to 250 years later than on the West Coast. Absence of one of these bell types (IA5a) in Northern Mexico may be the result of lack of excavation in certain areas. A striking example of possible trade between Southern Mexico and the site of Amapa, sug- gesting the possibility of trade with other West Coast sites, is seen in the presence at Amapa of a ring (Type IVC2) which is very strongly re- miniscent of Southern Mexican forms (Pen- dergast 1962). The form probably occurs earlier in Southern Mexico, since it seems likely to have a fairly late date at Amapa. The occur- rence of this type of ring at Amapa, where no other similarly elaborate metalwork has been recovered, should, I believe, be laid to trade, with Southern Mexico as the most likely source. Trade in the opposite direction cannot be de- monstrated at Amapa, but may be shown at Tzintzuntzan, Michoacan. Materials from Tzintzuntzan fall outside the range of artifact types recorded at other West Mexican sites, suggesting that the metal-work- ing complex represented here has its roots in some other areas of Mesoamerica. The presence at the site of a variety of objects, including sev- eral ceremonial types, which do not occur else- where in West Mexico, but are common in Southern Mexico and the Maya area, points strongly to southern ties for the Tzintzuntzan materials. Among the more closely similar forms found at Tzintzuntzan and in the Maya area or South- ern Mexico are repousse discs (Type IA2) and stylized anthropomorphic figurines (Type VIIIA1). Furthermore, the quantity of gold recovered at Tzintzuntzan is greater than that recorded for other West Mexican sites, but is similar to amounts common at sites in Southern Mexico and the Maya area. These facts com- bine to indicate that southern influence was felt in Michoacan around 1300. The late date of the Tzintzuntzan occurrence favors Southern Mexico as the source of stimu- lus to this area of Michoacan, since by 1300 types found at Tzintzuntzan had disappeared in the Maya area. Whether or not influence was felt at Tzintzuntzan from other sources cannot be determined with certainty, although con- tacts with West and Central Mexican sites seem probable. These data provide strong support for the proposal that West Mexico functioned from very early times as a center of influence in Mesoamerican metal working. Trade, or stimu- lus diffusion, from West Mexico seems to have reached at least to the east and north, including the American Southwest, while, conversely, influences can be seen in West Mexico from both the east and south, the latter probably only in the later centuries of occupation on the West Coast. Eastern Mexico, unlike the West Coast, has yielded a relatively small quantity of metal arti- facts of comparatively few types. No utilitarian objects have been reported from Eastern Mex- ican sites, and the number of types in the other categories is quite small. The temporal range given for Eastern Mex- ican metal artifacts probably assigns too early a date for initial appearance. If metals actually appeared somewhat later than the indicated 536 [ VOL. 27, No. 4, 1962</page><page sequence="18">METAL IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA initial date of 900, it is logical to attribute ap- pearance of metal artifacts in Eastern Mexico to trade or stimulus diffusion from another area. Typological ties between this area and South- tern Mexico point to the latter region as the source of Eastern Mexican developments. All of the artifact types found in Eastern Mexico, with one exception, occur in Southern Mexico as well. The single exception (ear- spools, Type IIIA1) occurs in the Northern Maya area at an early date. The East Coast specimen may have been traded from this area. A large part of the distributional picture for Eastern Mexico is almost certainly the result of lack of excavation in many areas. Where excavations have been undertaken, metal arti- facts have often been revealed, although not in quantity. There are, in addition, several mu- seum specimens supposedly from Eastern Mex- ico, but with no definite provenience data. For this area, perhaps more than for any other except the Central Maya region, hypotheses concerning dates, relationships, and develop- ment of metal working must be regarded as highly tentative. What few data are available, however, suggest strong ties with Southern Mexico, perhaps beginning as early as 1000. Southern Mexico seems to have developed early as a center of metal working in Mesoamer- ica, and to have retained this status over a considerable length of time. Again, as in other areas, the initial date assigned to appearance of metals is uncertain, but may be only slightly after 900. It is probable that the initial intro- duction of metals in the Maya area was closely followed either by stimulus diffusion or by trade northward to the Oaxaca area, where at least a few comparatively elaborate artifact types seem to be quite early. In this respect, this area differs from those already discussed, in that elsewhere the earlier materials seem to be largely utilitarian and simple, unadorned non- utilitarian objects, with the more elaborate forms appearing later. While Southern Mexico has long been recog- nized as a metal-working center in Mesoamer- ica, from which objects were traded into Yuca- tan (Lothrop 1952: 109), and probably also into Eastern and West Mexico, there seems to have been proportionally less trade from this area than might be expected. Few objects from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza can be identified as Oaxacan in origin; most are thought to have come from Central Mexico (Lothrop 1952: 109). Trade to West Mexico seems to have come rather late, probably no earlier than 1300, while Southern influence in Eastern Mexico may have been felt as early as 1000. Despite this long history of manufacture and trade of metal artifacts in Southern Mexico, the area does not seem to have exerted the widespread influence felt from the Southern Maya area and from West Mexico. In addition to trade from Southern Mexico to other areas, there seems to have been some re- ciprocal transmission of objects or ideas. The T-shaped knife (Type VIIIA) appears earlier in Central than in Southern Mexico, although in the latter area it achieved more widespread use. This may be an instance of trade or diffu- sion to the south from the Central area. In addition, objects have been recovered at Monte Alban which seem to be of Central American origin, suggesting rather late trade to the Oaxaca area from outside Mesoamerica. In sum, the Southern Mexican area is clearly one which was an important center of metal working, and one in which elaborate develop- ments appeared early and lasted over a long period of time. Furthermore, the area received a number of outside influences, both from the south and the north, and exerted some in- fluence on other areas as well. Due perhaps to partial geographic or cultural isolation, how- ever, Southern Mexican groups, although they developed metallurgy to a high degree, seem to have had less influence on metal working in surrounding areas than might be expected from a large and long-lived center. The Southern Maya area, like Southern Mex- ico, was the center of a diversified and long- lived metallurgical tradition. This area seems, as noted above, to have been among the first to receive the concept of metal working from Cen- tral America, due probably to the proximity of the two areas. The Southern Maya area ap- pears also to have served as a base for the dif- fusion of metal working to other parts of the Maya region, as well as to Southern, and ulti- mately, Eastern and Central Mexico. Few artifact types are unique to the Southern Maya, and most of the types recovered here are wide- spread in Mesoamerica, suggesting that in- fluence from this area covered an extensive region. The large number of types represented also points to the Southern Maya area as a cen- ter of diffusion to much of Mesoamerica. 537 PENDERGAST ]</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY It should be noted that a considerable dif- ference exists between materials from the more southerly sites in the Southern Maya area and those in Highland Guatemala. The Highland sites, which are in several cases later than the southern occupation, contain a wider variety of types than found to the south. In general, finds at sites in the southern zone have been sparse, and have usually comprised not more than a few types, while some of the Highland sites have yielded a great variety of types. Thus, both the typological and temporal range for the Southern Maya area embrace a wide variety of sites and materials, many of which may be only distantly related. Nevertheless, the South- ern Maya area, which is a realistic entity in many other senses, does form a meaningful unit for this study when considered as a route and base for the spread of metallurgy into the re- mainder of the Maya area and parts of Mexico. The Central Maya area has yielded a com- paratively small number of metal artifacts, due largely to lack of excavation in some areas, and to excavation in early sites in others. However, within the limited range of types noted for the area, there are some which raise interesting questions. The majority of the artifact types from the Central Maya area are also found in the North- ern Maya area, while only five of the 13 types from the Central Maya area have been found in Southern Maya territory. This would seem to indicate that metal working in the Central Maya area had its origin to the north, rather than the south. There are, in addition, four Central Maya types which appear in neither the Southern nor the Northern Maya area, but are found in other regions of Mesoamerica. There seem to be no types unique to the Cen- tral Maya area. Despite the absence in the Southern Maya area of several types found in the Central Maya region, I suspect that metal working in the latter territory probably developed as a result of in- fluence from the south. The position of the Central Maya area as a route of trade from the south into Southern Mexico would seem to dictate a strong influence on the area from the Southern Maya. When it is considered that many of the types recovered in the Yucatecan Peninsula are thought to have been traded from either the Southern Maya or, in many cases, from Central America (Lothrop 1952: 108-9), the assignment of Central Mayan de- velopments to influence from the Southern Maya seems more logical than does a northern origin. The distributional and typological picture presented for the Central Maya area is, like that for Eastern Mexico, open to question, since excavation has been limited in many areas. Further research in this region will undoubtedly reveal a more varied metallurgical tradition, and may also demonstrate the existence of locally manufactured types not known at pres- ent. The Northern Maya area has produced a considerable variety of types, many of which are known only from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza. While some, if not all, of the more elaborate metal objects recovered from the Cenote were undoubtedly traded into the area, or brought to the area to be thrown into the Cenote, there is good evidence, both in the form of similar materials from Mayapan and Dzantuin C'hen, and in the treatment of design elements, that many artifacts are of local manu- facture. This is particularly true of several types of bells. In addition, the few utilitarian objects recovered at Mayapan are probably of local manufacture, although axes from Chichen Itza may have been traded from Southern Mexico (Lothrop 1952: 109). The presence of a variety of types in the Northern Maya area does not, then, as in other areas, indicate a highly developed metallurgical industry in the region. With the exception of two artifact types, bells (Type IBlb) and cups (Type XV) there are no artifacts unique to the area. This might, as in the Southern Maya area, indicate that extensive trade had spread Northern Mayan types over a wide area. This may be true for some types. In most cases, however, a source other than the Northern Maya area seems more likely. The presence of all but a few types found in the Northern Maya area in either the Central or Southern Maya region suggests that many of the Northern Maya types entered the area from the south. This does not rule out the Northern Maya area as a base for diffusion of some types to both the south and the north; indeed, one artifact type from Eastern Mexico may have come from the Northern Maya area. Trade is also indicated in the occurrence of pyriform bells (Types ID5a, ID6a) in West Mexico and in Yucatan at approximately the same time. Here, however, the direction of trade is uncer- 538 [ VOL. 27, No. 4, 1962</page><page sequence="20">METAL IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA tain, although the apparent status of West Mexico as a center of metal working suggests that trade may have been from the West Coast south. An additional problem exists with regard to the Northern Maya area. This is that at least one type occurs both here and in West Mexico, but within time spans which are far from over- lapping. The artifact, a wirework pyriform bell (Type ID7a) is dated at between 1000 and 1200 at Chichen Itza, and appears at Tzintzuntzan, Michoacan, sometime after 1300. The virtual identity of specimens from the two sites almost rules out independent invention of the form. Since neither trade nor stimulus diffusion from Yucatan to West Mexico can be adduced to explain the occurrences, we are forced to sug- gest that the type of diffusion which probably accounted for very early appearance of metals in both the Southern Maya area and West Mexico must have continued until quite late in prehispanic Mesoamerica. That is, the bells must have been traded, or the idea must have been transmitted, to both sites at different times from a third source, presumably outside Meso- america. This same phenomenon may have occurred with other types, although nowhere else is there such close resemblance of artifacts in contexts of non-overlapping date. The North Mexican area seems to have re- ceived strong influence from West Mexico. All of the artifact types so far recovered in North- ern Mexico are found in West Mexico, with the possible exception of flattened globular bells (Type IBla). This is not true of Central Mex- ico, the only other area sufficiently close to Northern Mexico to be suspected as a source of stimulus or as a base for trade to the north. This does not, of course, eliminate Central Mexico as a source of influence in Northern Mexico; such influence was undoubtedly felt, but closer ties seem to have existed with West Mexico. A specific instance of trade between West and Northern Mexico may be seen in the pres, ence of fishhooks (Type IXA1) in both areas. The appearance of this type perhaps 50-100 years later in Northern than in Western Mexico can probably be laid to trade with West Mex- ico, perhaps specifically from the Amapa area, which is the northernmost site now known to yield fishhooks on the West Coast (Pendergast 1962). Trade or stimulus diffusion may also account for the occurrence in Guerrero and Durango of nearly identical ear spools (Type TIIB). Here again, the direction of movement may have been from south to north, although this is not certain. Axes (Type IVA) may also have spread into Northern Mexico from West Mexcio, although the form is as early in Central Mexico, which may have been the source. Northern Mexico is listed as the center of manufacture or use of three types, fishhooks (Type IXA1), globular bells (Type IAla-i), and flattened pyriform bells (Type ICla). Of these, the first two almost certainly derived from West Mexico. The third type (ICla) seems to have centered in Northern Mexico, although it also occurs in West Mexico. While Northern Mexico seems not to have been a major metal-working center, the area was of importance as a route of trade between West Mexico (and possibly Central Mexico) and the American Southwest. That the area may have had more importance than merely as a trade route is, however, suggested by recent work at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, which has revealed the existence of a greater variety of metal artifacts than previously known from the region. It is likely that, with further work, Northern Mexico will, like West Mexico, as- sume greater importance than heretofore ac- corded it as a metal-working center. The American Southwest has yielded only a limited quantity of artifacts, comprising a few types of bells and a single disc bead (Type IIA). Of these, the most common is the plain globular bell (Type IAla-i), which is common in all areas of Mesoamerica as well. This type is so widespread as to be of little value as an indicator of relationships. The remaining bell types and the disc bead, none of which is numerous in the Southwest, are all found in West Mexico, with the excep- tion of the flattened globular bell (Type IBla) which is found elsewhere only in the Southern and Northern Maya areas. Since the relation- ship of these finds is highly unlikely, an undis- covered source in West, Central, or Northern Mexico must be postulated for the Southwest specimen. All of the bell types occurring in the South- west and in West Mexico appear in West Mex- ico much earlier. Type ICla, which appears in West Mexico by about 900 and in the Amer- ican Southwest by approximately 1100, also occurs in Northern Mexico by about 1000. Both areas must, therefore, be considered as possible PENDERGAST ] 539</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sources of the Southwestern specimen. No more precise definition of origin is possible at present. Root (1947: 81) suggests that the bell from Mammoth, Arizona, (Type IC6a) may have come from Eastern Mexico, a suggestion which seems well founded in view of the apparent absence of the type in West and Northern Mexico, and the report of a specimen from an unspecified site in the Huasteca. While it is possible that a few of the South- western bells may have been locally made, the majority seem to have been traded into the area from Mesoamerica. On the basis of geo- graphic proximity, Northern and West Mexico are the most logical choices as sources for the Southwestern specimens. It is probable that both of these areas had some influence on the Southwest, with some types being transmitted from each. Northern Mexico may have con- tributed bells of Types IA1 a-i, ICla, IC2a, and IDla; bells of Type IA5a, the disc bead, and all of the above-mentioned bell types could also have come from West Mexico. While no more definitive statement concerning exact sources for the Southwestern occurrences is possible at present, it is clear that West and Northern Mexico remain the most probable sources of influence on the American Southwest. The foregoing discussion includes a variety of data bearing on the introduction and diffusion of metals in Mesoamerica and the Southwest. While the range of material discussed is great, it is possible to discern within it a broad Meso- american pattern, based on the definition of two major centers of influence in the diffusion of metallurgy. Although earlier discussions of the develop- ment of metallurgy in Mesoamerica have laid all influence to Central America via the South- ern Maya region, it appears now that West Mexico functioned along with this region as an early center of diffusion. Examination of the summary of distributional data reveals, in fact, that the number of types represented in West Mexico is greater than that found in the South- ern Maya area, and that many of the types found in West Mexico appear in several other areas, suggesting that extensive trade or stimu- lus diffusion took place from West Mexico. In a sense, Mesoamerica can be divided into two zones, one influenced largely by groups in the Southern Maya area, the other by groups in West Mexico. The former zone includes the remainder of the Maya area, Southern, Eastern, and Central Mexico, while the latter comprises Northern Mexico, perhaps Central Mexico to some extent, and the American Southwest. This division is, of course, an oversimplification; not all of the developments in a subarea can be laid to one of these two major centers. Aside from numerous local developments, there are such phenomena as the situation at Tzintzun- tzan, pointing to Southern Mexico or Mayan influence in West Mexico. If one is concerned with defining the im- mediate relationships of a single site or com- plex, division of Mesoamerica into two spheres of influence may be a hindrance, rather than a help. As an aid to understanding the nature of broader developments within Mesoamerica, however, the recognition of two major sources of diffusion of metallurgy seems to have definite value, both in the evaluation of discoveries and perhaps also in directing further research. This study has also included definitions of relationships between various subareas on the basis of typological cross-ties. A number of artifact types are of value in such relative dat- ing of complexes. Many artifact types, not included in discussions of distribution because they are known only from a single site or area, are potentially useful as a means of relative dating. The plaques from Amapa (Types XIA1 and XIB1) are good examples of such potential time markers; discovery of these arti- fact types in another site would provide a basis for dating the site between 900-1200, and prob- ably within the latter part of this time span. Presence of such artifacts in other sites might also point to trade or other relationships not suggested by other data. While similarities in artifact assemblages from various sites and subareas form the basis for the hypotheses presented here concerning inter-areal relationships, it is rarely possible to go beyond these discussions to use metal arti- facts as critical time markers. Because of the lack of precise chronological data, most artifact types cannot be tied down with sufficient pre- cision to allow pinpointing of dates. However, analysis of patterns of distribution, coupled with use of often imprecise chronological data, allows formulation of a logical scheme of tem- poral and spatial relationships. Closely allied to the question of precise dat- ing of artifact types is the complexity of the forms in question. It appears that, with the pos- sible exception of Southern Mexico, the earlier 540 [ VOL. 27, No. 4, 1962</page><page sequence="22">METAL IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA locally manufactured objects in the various subareas tend to be utilitarian, or simple non- utilitarian forms, such as the plain globular bell (Type IAla-i) which are generally devoid of decoration. Increasing use of metal is ac- companied by technological elaboration, result- ing in the appearance of a wide range of ob- jects of personal adorment, and of ceremonial ob- jects, in most areas. Within restricted contexts, at least, it is possible to assign a later date to the more elaborate artifacts, and perhaps there- by to enable more critical use of such forms as time markers. This division of an assemblage of metal artifacts in terms of elaboration is ex- emplified in the analysis of metals from Amapa (Pendergast 1962). Degree of complexity can also be used as a measure of the importance of subareas of Meso- america as centers of an intensive local metal- lurgical industry or as bases of influence in the diffusion of metal working. Considered in terms both of the variety of artifact types and of the number of non-utilitar- ian objects produced, three areas stand out as major centers. Two of these, West Mexico and the Southern Maya area, were probably major centers from which both the concept of metal working and metal artifacts themselves diffused throughout Mesoamerica. The third area, Southern Mexico, was also a center of consider- able importance, but the limited number of types which diffused from this area suggests that complexity here is an indication of the status of Southern Mexico as a major religious and social center, where both cultural demands and the existence of a class of artisans resulted in greater production of elaborate items of material culture. This statement applies to the two other areas as well, but they have the addi- tional importance to this study of having been foci of major spheres of influence in Mesoamer- ican metallurgy. These inferences and suggestions based on analysis of metal artifacts have shown the value of such analysis in providing a body of specific data from which may be drawn a logical picture of Mesoamerican metal working. Many of the limitations in this study derive from the quality of excavation in some areas and the lack of investigations in others. For this reason, the conclusions presented here must be regarded as tentative; further excavation can be expected to revise many of the specific statements, and perhaps some of the generalizations as well. To some extent, the typological classification and the distribution studies undertaken in this paper may aid in directing such future investigations, thus filling some of the gaps which now exist in our knowledge of Mesoamerican prehistory. No effort has been made in this study to follow each avenue of approach to its potenti- ally multiple ends. However, the types of in- formation which can reasonably be expected from distributional analyses have been in- dicated, and the value of such analyses in il- lustrating relationships not otherwise readily apparent has been pointed out. A series of hypotheses has been formulated. Although they are admittedly speculative, they provide a basis for organizing and interpreting developments in the metallurgy of prehispanic Mesoamerica.
