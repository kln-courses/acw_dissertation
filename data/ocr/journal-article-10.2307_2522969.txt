Despite its somnewhat mystifying title, this book on police unionism is both valuable and readable. Focusing on the political nature of the development and militant activity of police unions, it provides some interesting insights, both as to the details of the events it describes and the theoretical context into which these events fit. The author recounts in some detail the his- tory of police unionism in three cities: New York, Detroit, and Atlanta. She analyzes these three cases, generating some broad propositions about police unionism, specifically, and public employee unionism in general. In the introductory chapters, in addition to re- peating some rather conventional explana- tions of unionization of public employees, she makes several interesting points. She argues, for example, that there is a fundamental tendency of unionization to, "erode hierarchical authority relations and 'rational' decision making, two of the central requirements of modern, efficient bureaucracy." Whether rationality is a practice of such bureaucracies rather than merely an ideal is debatable, but the point is well worth con- sidering and arguing. She also traces the history of public employee militancy. From this she de- rives several conclusions of interest. For instance, she observes that employees will choose strikes and job disruptions where certain factors affect both the political and economic position of the worker, leading to his proletarianization. She suggests that these factors are relatively high in- flation, major urban unrest, intense private labor struggles, recent expansion of government em- ployment, tight labor markets (with some excep- tions), a stable employee organization, and evi- dence of government tolerance toward employee organization. It is with particular reference to these conditions that she observes police union- ization in New York, Detroit, and Atlanta. A theme that recurs frequently in the case studies is the assistance given to police tLinions by liberal elected officials who viewed collective bargaining as a means of avoiding both strikes and higher wage and benefit costs. Levi also discusses the occurrence of collusive bargaining between city officials and union officials, by by means of which each group of officials serves its own interests in remaining in power. This is an important point. It is weakened somewhat, however, by the author's failure to point out that some of the behaviors she terms "collusive" are rather common in the private sector and are gen- erally believed to be part of a legitimate and con- structive pattern of bargaining behavior. In her description of police unionization in New York City, Levi gives major credit for the de- velopment of public employee unions to the pragmatic liberalism of Mayor Wagner. Wagner is seen as using collective bargaining as a device for controlling and minimizing conflict. Levi concludes that the failure of this strategy led Wagner's successors to resort to collusion. This account is enlivened by a number of very inter- esting quotations from persons deeply involved in this struggle, giving the reader a feeling of "the real stuff" of the conflict. The great Detroit blue flu epidemic, its ante- cedents, and its aftermath are a fascinating ex- ample of police insurgency. The author sees the original formation of the Detroit Police Officers Association in 1944 as resulting in large part from the Detroit race riots and the subsequent public criticism of the police. In the 1960s crit- icism and pressure directed at the police were coupled with legislative authorization of col- lective bargaining. The result was the protective response of unionization. The Atlanta police are described as coming re- luctantly to the conclusion that unionization was literally "the only way" that they could ac- quire the representation they needed. Their as- sociation with the Fraternal Order of Police is explained simply by one of their activists as follows: "You needed strength. You needed strength in numbers, and you needed a name that carried weight." In Atlanta, the movement to unionize was complicated somewhat by accusa- tions that union organization was a cloak for racism. In her final chapter, Levi properly emphasizes the "far-reaching political consequences" of public employee unionization, concluding that, "Private sector workers may have the power to 551</page><page sequence="2">552 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW cripple the economy, but public sector workers can cripple both the economy and the state." Contrary to her statements, however, re- cent experience with public employee strikes may indicate that governments can survive and even gain popularity with a tax resistant popula- tion when they fail to keep the schools open and the busses running. She includes an interesting discussion of Marxist and neoclassical eco- nomic theory on the "purpose" of the capitalist state. This reviewer must admit, however, to increasing doubts about the usefulness of the anthropomorphism of attributing intentions and purposes to organizations, including the state. On balance, I believe this to be a valuable book, and well worth reading. Its chief strengths are the wealth of detail it provides and the use of some very broad theoretical and philosophical concepts to explain the phenomena that are des- cribed. The use of Marxist ideas, along with other theoretical statements, taps a rich reservoir of concepts that American industrial relations scholars too often ignore. The book also has some weaknesses. The cases selected for study, for example, although dramatic, are hardly typ- ical. In a more broadly based study, Police Un- ionism, Juris and Feuille correctly point out the danger of focusing solely upon the most dram- atic cases. Levi's conclusions do appear to out- strip, and be somewhat biased by, the limited and atypical nature of her cases. By comparison to Juris and Feuille, she does not tie her study to the industrial relations literature and concepts very thoroughly. One such concept, "multilat- eral bargaining," would seem to have deserved more than the passing mention she gives it, con- sidering the political orientation of her analysis. On the other hand, the author does attempt to search out the deep root causes and effects of public employee unionism, drawing upon a broader literature than is typically used by scholars in this area. This fact, standing alone, makes Bureaucratic Insurgency worth reading. It should be interesting and stimulating for stu- dents of public employee collective bargaining. Hoyt N.
