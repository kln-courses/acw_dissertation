Michael Stanley discusses an alder-wood figure deposited in the boglands of east Offaly during the Bronze Age. I i i I 1 1 i illlllllli The first according first woman man to from sprang an a ancient mountain from an Irish alder ash tradition. - tree, at least the first woman from a mountain ash - at least according to an ancient Irish tradition. Alder (feamog in Irish), like all trees, has a rich folklore associated with it. When cut, alder wood soon turns from white to blood red, and 'the red man' is among its European folk-names. In Ireland it was considered to be a tree of war and death on account of its red colour and its traditional use in the manufacture of shields (Mac Coitir 2003, 34). One thinks of the Bronze Age alder-wood shields from Annadale, Co. Leitrim, and Cloonlara, Co. Mayo. In the winter 2003 issue of Archaeology Ireland, the Irish Archaeological Wetland Unit (IAWU) reported the discovery of a prehistoric alder-wood 'figure' in Kilbeg townland, Ballykean Bog, Co. Offaly, 5km south-east of Daingean town (McDermott etal. 2003, 22-3). The object was subsequently dated to the Bronze Age, and further research suggested that the 'red man' of Kilbeg was one of seven probable alder-wood idols deposited in the raised bogs of east Offaly during the early-middle Bronze Age (Stanley 2006; 2007). While the interpretation of such objects is problematic, these discoveries, if accepted as truly anthropomorphic, bring the number of Irish prehistoric figures to eleven. These Bronze Age 'red men' stand apart in this assemblage and divining their meaning is a tantalising challenge. The Kilbeg figure The IAWU surveyed Ballykean Bog, an industrial peatland owned by Bord na Mona, in summer 2003. Forty- three previously undocumented sites were identified, generally concentrated in the south-eastern corner in Kilbeg townland, where the bog narrows. An enigmatic wooden object was identified on the bog surface here between two plank trackways dated by dendrochronology to 1425+9 BC and 1454±9 BC respectively. This artefact was crudely but unmistakably sculpted to represent a limbless human form. The Kilbeg figure consists of a curved alder roundwood (231cm long and 16cm in max. diameter), heavily damaged on one side. It is</page><page sequence="2">worked to a point at one end, beyond which is a short unworked portion retaining bark. One end of the bark section is cut perpendicular to the long axis, as if to represent a waist. Approximately half of the circumference of the remainder of the object has been surface- dressed but for a small area of bark at the junction of the neck and the main body. The opposing side is unworked but has been stripped of bark. At the opposite end the wood has been carved to form a narrow, well-defined neck. Originally attached to the neck was a bulbous head, which had fractured from the main body and broken in two. The junction of the neck and head consists of a straight edge cut perpendicular to the long axis. Eleven notches, set c. 3cm apart, are cut across its width between the bark section and the neck. These notches have one edge cut perpendicular to the long axis and the other edge cut at a 60° angle. The notches are crudely carved and on average measure 11cm by 2cm and 1cm in depth. (It is tempting to view these as representing pairs of ribs, of which there should be twelve to be anatomically correct.) A centrally placed, lozenge-shaped incision between the notches and the bark section is interpreted as representing a navel. This was created by two simple blows from opposing directions and appears to be quite deliberate, as it is out of character with the surrounding surface dressing. Despite the possible depiction of a number of anatomical features the figure is of indeterminate sex. The wood is in very good condition, exhibiting no root or insect damage indicative of prolonged exposure. This suggests that the figure may have been deliberately deposited face downwards in the bog soon after its creation. It would appear, however, that the object might have been exposed in an upright position for a period of time before this, as the pointed end is the least degraded part. A sample from the Kilbeg figure has been radiocarbon-dated to 1739-1530 cal. BC (3356+37 BP, UB-6565). Archaeology Ireland Summer 2012 The 'red men' of Ballykilleen The discovery of the Kilbeg figure was not wholly surprising to the IAWU field crew. That same summer, only 12km to the north- east, excavations in Cloncreen Bog were simultaneously exhuming wooden idols in the townland of Ballykilleen. Though closely comparable to the Kilbeg example, the anthropomorphic features of the Ballykilleen figures are arguably less convincing. In 2002 the IAWU surveyed a number of bogs in east Offaly, including Cloncreen Bog. Four roundwood artefacts were discovered in Ballykilleen, in the north-eastern corner of the bog, where most of the 117 newly identified sites were recorded. Partial exposure of two of these artefacts revealed varying numbers of incised V-shaped notches along their length. One object lay beneath a brushwood trackway; the other wa^ associated with a sparse deposit of wood. A third artefact had similar notches and a bulbous terminal. The fourth find was similarly carved but devoid of notches. The latter two artefacts were recovered during the survey, as they were fully exposed on the field surface and were in very fragmentary condition. The two partly exposed objects were secured in situ to be recovered the following year by Archaeological Development Services Ltd (ADS) on behalf of Bord na Mona. On excavation, both artefacts were interpreted as anthropomorphic figures, and two more figures were discovered during further excavations in Ik. the area (Corcoran 2003). 'RED MAN' These discoveries prompted a reassessment of the two artefacts recovered by the IAWU and it has been suggested that they might also be viewed as anthropomorphic (Stanley 2006; 2007). The first item (find no. 02E0941:4a-c) was recovered from within a short brushwood trackway. This find was broken into four fragments, only three of which are extant. It is estimated to have been c. 130cm in length originally. The entire object is dressed and one end is cut to a point; the other end was damaged so that the original end shape is indeterminate. Two V- shaped notches are cut into the broken end, one of which spans the entire circumference to create the impression of a neck and bulbous head. There are also two subrectangular sockets, one on either side of this notch. A wedge-shaped cut evident on the broken end of fragment 02E0941:4b may be the remains of a third notch, and therefore further notches were possibly incised along its length. This artefact was identified as alder and the trackway was dated to 1734-1455 cal. BC (3306±53 BP, Wk-11728). The second artefact (02E0941:5a-c) was recovered from the surface of a brushwood trackway. It had been broken into three pieces and was heavily damaged on one side. Its surviving length is 43cm and the maximum diameter is 9cm. The artefact is partly dressed along its length and broken at one end. A broken V-shaped notch close to the opposite end creates the appearance of a neck and head similar to the other Ballykilleen figures (see below). Abrasion, possibly indicative of wear, is evident on the head, neck and upper body. The intact end is cut to a curved, blunted terminal. This artefact was also identified as alder and the trackway was dated to 1770-1497 cal. BC (3349+57 BP, Wk-11730). These dates establish very close links with the directly dated alder figure from Kilbeg. Left: The Kilbeg figure following its removal from the peat. (Photo: IAWU.)

(Drawings by Simon Dick. Source: IAWU.) 36 Archaeology Ireland Summer 2012 'RED MAN' The four artefacts excavated by ADS in 2003 were interpreted as anthropomorphic figures manufactured to a common design comprising a neck, bulbous head and pointed end. The largest idol is 240cm in length. The entirety of each object is surface-dressed and between six and eleven V-shaped notches are carved along one or two sides (Corcoran 2003; Corcoran and Whitaker 2003). Three figures were discovered within 10m of each other and were deliberately deposited beneath wooden trackways/ platforms. The fourth example was c. 50m from these, associated with a sparse deposit of wood. It was observed that none of the objects displayed any evidence of weathering, although it has been suggested that originally they would have been set upright as markers across the bog (Corcoran 2003). Final excavation reports are currently in preparation, but wood species identification has confirmed that each object was carved from alder. Direct radiocarbon dating of all four figures indicates a date range of 1700-1490 cal. BC. (This unpublished information was kindly supplied by Jane Whitaker, ADS.) Previous discoveries and parallels Prior to 2001, only three prehistoric idols were known from Ireland, all of which were recovered from wetlands. The oldest figure was recovered from disturbed contexts at the early medieval 'royal' crannog at Lagore, Co. Meath. This oak figure (47cm in height) is explicitly anthropomorphic, with a clearly identifiable head, shoulders and legs. It may also have a phallus, which has led to its interpretation as a male figure. Radiocarbon dating returned an early Bronze Age date of 2135-1944 cal. BC (Coles 1990). A second Bronze Age figure, dated to 1096-906 cal. BC {ibid.), was discovered by turf-cutters at Ralaghan, Co. Cavan. This yew figure (114cm in height) represents the most explicitly anthropomorphic idol discovered in Ireland. Its head has clearly depicted facial features, the body is finely carved and, although armless, the figure has distinct legs. A circular slot in the pelvic area may have held a separate phallus but might also represent female genitalia. The third idol, from Corlea, Co. Longford, is the least representational. Its classification as anthropomorphic is subjective to some extent - although this can be said of numerous European examples (van der Sanden and Capelle 2001). It consists of a 5m-tall ash roundwood cut to a point at one end, while the other end has a carved neck and bulbous head. Two branch stumps give the appearance of a nose and an eye, and a third stump below the neck has been described as 'distinctly phallic' in appearance (Raftery 1996, 286). This artefact was incorporated within the substructure of the Iron Age (148 BC) trackway Corlea 1. In 2001 an idol comparable to the Corlea figure was discovered in bogland at Broughal, Co. Offaly. It consists of a split oak trunk (64cm in height) with a distinct head incorporating a topknot hairstyle and an undifferentiated body. Woodworking evidence suggests that this object dates from the Iron Age (Stanley 2007, 184). Wooden idols from various periods are known from northern and north-west Europe, the Kilbeg and Ballykilleen figures forming part of the more abstract end of the spectrum within this tradition. Many examples from mainland Europe exhibit carved necks and bulbous heads, but notches are rare. The closest parallel is a female figure of birch (105cm in height) from Rebild, Denmark, which has been radiocarbon- dated to 760-610 cal. BC. It has a neck and bulbous head that bear a striking resemblance to the Kilbeg figure, and also has five straight- edged notches carved into the lower body. Clearly, the closest parallel for the Kilbeg figure is found among the Ballykilleen idols, particularly the five examples with pointed ends, well-defined necks, bulbous heads and incised notches. Discussion Although not explicitly anthropomorphic, the figures from Kilbeg and Ballykilleen form part of a European tradition of similarly abstract effigies and represent a distinct regional group among Irish wooden idols. In addition to their similar design, all seven figures are carved from alder and are broadly contemporary in date. They also shared similar settings, being located at narrow sections of bog more amenable to safe passage. Anthropomorphic wooden figures have generally been interpreted as representations of deities in human form. These idols would presumably have been revered and may have been permanently on display at cult centres prior to their final deposition. Alternatively, they may have functioned as portable items, exhibited at significant times of the year. When not in use they could have been deposited in bogs for safekeeping and preservation. Idols found in close association with wooden structures have been documented, however, and the Offaly figures probably belong in this category. (Although the Kilbeg figure was an isolated find, it is possible that it originally lay beneath a trackway/platform, all evidence for which had been destroyed prior to discovery.) There is a case for interpreting some of the figures as protective markers, imbued with symbolic meaning and perceived supernatural powers, ensuring the safety of people traversing/accessing the bog on trackways or while using platforms. If set upright, they would have been helpful visual aids demarcating safe areas. The abraded example</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology Ireland Summer 2012 37 from Ballykilleen may even have been adorned with a wind-blown textile, as suggested for a figure associated with an Iron Age trackway in Wittemoor, Germany (van der Sanden and Capelle 2001, 49). The figures may also have signified ownership of particular routeways or territories - giving physical expression to a distinct cultural identity guaranteed by the presence of supernatural guardians (or effigies thereof). Nonetheless, most of the Ballykilleen examples appear to have been deliberately deposited beneath/within structures. Perhaps they were deposited in this manner so as to confer supernatural protection upon the sites and those who used them. These figures may have been revered in other contexts prior to becoming offerings of this sort, or perhaps they were created specifically for the purpose. The unweathered condition of the figures certainly indicates that they were not subject to prolonged exposure. An alternative interpretation is that these idols were ritually deposited as human effigies in lieu of actual human sacrifices. Alder's blood-red colour was perhaps symbolic of the blood of victims of ritualistic killings - a precursor to the ritual deaths evidenced by some Iron Age bog bodies. A late Bronze Age alder figure from Balluchulish, Scotland, may have been such an offering. An account of its discovery suggests that it was deposited face down in a pit at the base of a bog and held in place by stakes and wickerwork. It may be significant that the Kilbeg figure was similarly deposited in a prone position. Evidence from Iron Age bog bodies indicates that certain individuals were ritually slain, deposited in bogs and held in place by brushwood, stakes and so on. It is difficult to believe that these wooden 'human bodies' are not metaphorically related to actual human remains recovered from bogs (O'Sullivan 2007, 188). Kelly (2006) argues that the ritualistic mutilation and deposition of some Iron Age bog bodies is related to sacral kingship and the maintenance of fertility, sovereignty and power. As such, it is notable I wood from Left: Aalborg Ltd. carved Right: before 760-610 (Photo One Rebild, figures Freja', it towards Historical cal. widens. of courtesy the a Denmark, BC. discovered birch-wood the Ballykilleen A Museum.)

Right: Freja', a birch-wood figure from Rebild, Denmark, dated to 760-610 cal. BC. A fifth notch is carved towards the base, just before it widens. (Photo courtesy of Aalborg Historical Museum.) that alder also has folkloric links to kingship. For instance, the Welsh tale Branwen, daughter of Llyr relates the death of a king named Gwern (meaning alder), and a Danish legend tells of an 'alder king' carrying children away to their deaths. The idea of an alder effigy acting as a substitute for a human body is also contained within two Scottish tales, one of which describes the abduction of a woman by fairies and the leaving of an alder log in her place (Mac Coitir 2003, 34, 37-8). Alder has generally negative associations within Irish folk tradition, linking it with bad luck, war, fire and death. This is shared across Europe. Might the deposition of the alder- wood figures in Kilbeg and Ballykilleen speak of some dark episode - war, disease, famine - that befell the Bronze Age people of this region? While the notches potentially carried specific cultural meanings forever lost to us, O'Sullivan (2007, 187) has described the, Kilbeg figure as representing 'an almost starved human torso with projecting "ribs'". The same might be said of the Ballykilleen figures. Were Offaly's 'alder kings' sacrificed to somehow make amends? ■ Acknowledgements The surveys of Cloncreen Bog and Ballykean Bog were commissioned by Duchas the Heritage Service (whose functions are now undertaken by the National Monuments Service, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht).
