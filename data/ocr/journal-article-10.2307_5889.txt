<plain_text><page sequence="1">find that buffalo apparently do not take account of predation when selecting grazing patches, and that there is no evidence to suggest that there is any effort to time activity patterns to avoid predator activity; all this in spite of the fact that nearly 88% of adult and subadult animals end up as a lion's meal! The author extends his consideration of social behaviour in this species by looking at cognition, intel- ligence and decision-making. Inclusion of such a con- sideration may be seen as potentially disastrous in 'credibility terms since it becomes all too easy to fall into the twin pitfalls of anthropomorphism and anec- dote. Prins, however, manages to keep this discussion firmly in the field of behavioural ecology by con- sidering this in terms of adaptive significance of the species' social evolution. By stressing the variation of individual buffalo within the herd from the general advantages of the 'average' group member, he high- lights the social inequality which exists between indi- viduals and leads into the concept of the herd as a means by which behavioural adjustments of indi- viduals may be a response to information garnered from the behaviours of conspecifics. In all, this is a highly informative and easily read- able text which makes an excellent companion to, and extension of, the earlier work of Grimsdell (1969) and Sinclair (1977), and helps dispel many of the old myths propagated by white hunters about this animal.

EDITORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995 We record that the winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995, announced at the AGM meeting in Sheffield in December, was Mr Gareth Russell. Gareth Russell's paper, 'A century of turnover: community dynamics at three timescales' (Vol. 64, pp. 628-641) with Jared Diamond, Stuart Pimm and Timothy Reed arose from his PhD programme currently being conducted at the University of Tennessee. The paper aims to develop a model of how the observed turnover of bird communities changes with the interval over which they are censused. It is the first such model to incorporate the effect of a non-equilibrium number of species. The model fits well the data from 13 small British and Irish islands and suggsts two, asymptotic components to turnover that are important over different timescales. Gareth will graduate in May of this year, after which he will be taking up a post-doctoral position. For 2 years, he will be spending 8 months of the year at the newly formed National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara, and 4 months of the year at the Centre for Population Biology at Silwood Park in the UK. ? 1996 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, 398-400 400 Book Reviews</page></plain_text>
