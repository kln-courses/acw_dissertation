<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PROBLEMS OF TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN THE ODES OF SOLOMON A PROBLEM that was much discussed in the earlier years of the present century, and was the subject of a number of articles in the Journal, was that of the original language of the Odes of Solomon. The Odes had survived only in Syriac,1 apart from a few preserved in a Coptic translation, and some scholars2 believed that the former language was the one in which they had been composed. Others, however, argued for a Greek3 or for a Hebrew4 original, while yet another opinion3 was that, although the Syriac had been translated from the Greek, the Greek was itself a rendering of an originally Semitic work. The arguments for composition in Syriac seem to me to have established a slight balance of probability in its favour, but the evidence then avail able did not suffice to prove one hypothesis and to discredit the others. The question was reopened in 1959, when Dr. M. Testuz published6 a papyrus (number XI) from the Bodmer collection containing Ode xi in Greek and dating from the third century A.D. Now, at last, the Greek text of one of the Odes can be compared with the Syriac, and it might have been expected that it would solve the problem of the original language. Such an expectation would have been over-optimistic. Scholars have certainly claimed to find relevant evidence in the papyrus, but the conclusions drawn by them have differed from one another, and a series of hypotheses similar to those of the earlier years of the century 1 I have adopted the numbering of verses in vol. i of R. Harris and A. Min gana, The Odes and Psalms of Solomon (Manchester, 1916), which is not always the same as in vol. ii (1920). Although the two manuscripts containing the Syriac text use the Serta script, the quotations in the present paper are in Estrangela, because the question of confusion between letters sometimes arises and it is desirable to see the alphabet in which the Odes were written in ancient times. Vol. ii of the edition by Harris and Mingana contains a bibliography of the earlier literature, and a list of more recent publications is found in E.

Vôôbus1 has favoured a Syriac original, while A. Adam2 has argued for the slightly different theory of composition in an Aramaic dialect other than that of Edessa. M. Testuz, A. F. J. Klijn,3 and M. Philonenko,4 on the other hand, believe that the new evidence supports the hypothesis of a Greek original, though Testuz holds that the Greek was strongly influenced by 'un milieu ou des écrits sémitiques' or by both (p. 57). The theory of a Hebrew original has been defended at length by J. Carmignac,3 who has compared the Odes with the Hodayoth from Qumran. The purpose of the present paper is to consider the bearing of the Greek text of Ode xi on the problem of the original language and to assess the strength of the arguments that have been based on it. Some other matters relevant to the problem will also be examined. I A number of verses in Ode xi will now be studied, in order to discuss evidence that has, or has been thought to have, a bearing on the problem of the original language. Reference will frequently be made to the articles of Vôôbus and Carmignac, but page numbers will not normally be cited, since they discuss the verses of the Ode in order and it is easy to find their comments on a particular passage. Verses 1-3 Verses 1-3 contain a play on words in the Syriac. The Ode begins with the statement 'My heart was cut (îv^àtK'), and its flowers appeared', while verse 2 says 'the Most High cut me and verse 3 speaks of 'his incision (cnènov^)'· The poet appears to be referring, in this context, to the cutting or pruning of a tree, and it may be noted that the cognate noun (ι&lt;ϊ^) is sometimes used of a slit in the bark of a vine.6 But the verb and several cognate nouns can also be used of circumcision, and there is no doubt that the poet is alluding to the Old Testament idea of circumcizing the heart. There thus appears to be a double entendre in the Syriac, which is akin to, though not identi cal with, the practice found elsewhere in the Odes of using a root twice in close proximity in two different senses (Harris and Mingana, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 101-3). 1 A.

EMERTON The Greek text has ΠΕΡΕ1ΕΤΜΗ Θ Η in verse 1, ΠΕΡΙΕΤΕΜΕΝ ME ME in verse 2, and Η ΠΕΡΕΙΤΟΜΗ ΑΥΤΟΥ in verse 3. Although Carmignac says that the Greek can refer only to circumcision, there seems in fact to be a similar double entendre to that of the Syriac. As well as denoting circumcision, the verb ■περιτεμνει,ν can mean1 ,to cut, clip round about, prune (vines)'. A play on words is thus found in Greek as well as in Syriac. This fact does not enable us to decide which text is original in verses 1-3, but it nevertheless offers some help in determining the language in which the Odes were probably composed. First, a similar double entendre is found in the Syriac, but not the Greek, of verse 5, which is discussed below. Second, Carmignac's reconstruc tion of the supposed Hebrew original lacks the play on words. He suggests נמול in verse 1, מל in verse 2, and מילתו in verse 3; but the verb מול means 'to circumcise', and he does not claim for it any other meaning. He might, indeed, have compared Lev. xix. 23, which says of fruit trees: 'ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision (וערלתם ערלתו את־פו־יו): three years shall they be as uncircumcised (ערלים) unto you' (R.V.); but the root מול is not used, and there is no reference to cutting or pruning. Incidentally, it may also be observed that Carmignac's opinion that there are echoes of the Song of Sol. ii. 12 and of Isa. xlv. 8 (in the text of the A scroll from Qumran) in verse ι is far from certain. It is difficult to see why the writer could not have said 'its flowers appeared' (incidentally, the singular is used in the Song of Sol.) and 'sprouted' without quoting the Old Testament. Carmignac's further claim that his reconstruction is probable because it contains a play on words between ויפרח and (ויפר(ה is the kind of argument that gains strength only if a number of examples can be found; in any case, as has been seen, although he obtains one additional example of assonance, he loses what might well be regarded as a more important play on words in verses 1-3—and a play on words found in two texts that have not been reconstructed but have been preserved in manuscripts. Verses Verses 4 and 5 The Syriac text may be translated as follows: 4 From the beginning to the end I received his knowledge (or, knowledge of him); 5 And I was set firmly on the rock of truth, Where he established me. Before discussing the comments that have been made on these words since the publication of the Greek papyrus, I shall consider the view 1 Η. G. Liddell and Η. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (9th ed., revised by H. S. Jones and R. McKenzie, Oxford, 1940), ad 10c.</page><page sequence="4">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 375 of Harris and Mingana (op. cit., vol. ii, p. 270) that the composer of the Ode 'has been imitating' Wisd. vi. 22. They draw attention to the words in Wisdom rendered in the R.V. as 'from the beginning . . . the knowledge of her . . . the truth'. The allusion seems possible,1 though not certain, and the point is worth considering, since discussions of the original language of the Odes have sometimes involved the question whether it is possible to detect echoes of the Old Testament in a version that can be identified (cf. Harris and Mingana, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 110 ff.). Now that the Greek text of Ode xi has been recovered, it is possible to inquire whether the allusion, if such it be, to Wisd. vi. 22 is closer in the Greek to the LXX or in the Syriac to the Peshitta.2 To judge by verses 3, 5, and 6 (see the discussion of 'rock' and 'spring' below), it would certainly appear that, if the man responsible for the Greek Ode had intended or detected a biblical allusion, he would have used the words of the LXX. The evidence is best set out in tabular form: (a) 'from the beginning' : Peshitta 70.111 pa —Syriac Ode rC'àuiii pa LXX L·τ' άρχης —Greek Ode ΑΠ ΑΡΧΗΣ (b) 'the knowledge of her' : Peshitta —Syriac Ode cniv^i» LXX την γνώσιν αυτής —-Greek Ode ΤΗΝ ΣΥΝΕΣΙΝ ΑΥΤΟΥ (c) 'the truth' : Peshitta (variant —Syriac Ode κ'ϋϊ-.ι LXX την άληθειαν —Greek Ode [Σ]}ΤΕΡΕΑΣ The agreements of the Greek Ode with the LXX in (a) and of the Syriac with the Peshitta in (b) do not suffice to prove dependence, and the differences suggest that there is an allusion to neither the LXX nor the Peshitta. This conclusion is less favourable to the hypothesis of a Greek than to one of a Syriac original, since the Greek text of Wisdom was 1 Klijn draws attention to a number of affinities between the Odes and Wis dom in Aspects du judéo-christianisme, pp. 174 f. Harris and Mingana, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 116, detect an exact 'coincidence' between the language of Ode xxiii. 1-3 and that of the Peshitta of Wisdom iii. 9 and iv. 15, but I doubt whether the similarity need be explained as a borrowing from the Peshitta. 2 J. A. Emerton, The Peshitta of the Wisdom of Solomon (Leiden, 1959), ad loc. 3 Square brackets indicate a letter restored by Testuz. I have reproduced the spelling found in the manuscript, but have ignored errors corrected by the scribe.</page><page sequence="5">376 J. A. EMERTON certainly in existence when the Odes were written, whereas the Peshitta of Wisdom may not have been, for the books of the Apocrypha are com monly believed' to have been translated into Syriac after those of the Hebrew canon, and the translation may not have been made before the second century a.d. when the Odes were most probably composed. If, however, the poet wrote in Syriac and did not have access to the Peshitta of Wisdom, how did Ode xi. 4 f. come to be dependent on Wisd. vi. 22 ? There is no difficulty in the hypothesis that a poet who wrote in Syriac may have used a book in Greek. If, therefore, the Ode is dependent on Wisd. vi. 22, the dependence is more easily compatible with a Syriac than with a Greek original. Such an argument would be a very strong one, were it not for the uncertainty whether there is, in fact, an echo of the passage in the Apocrypha. A part of these verses that has been the subject of discussion by several scholars since the publication of the Greek Ode is the first line of verse 5 : re'iix-.i r&lt;Ls-a2L As. èn^èvt.re'© ΕΣΤΗΡΙΧΘΗΝ ΑΠΟ [Σ]ΤΕΡΕΑΣ ΠΕΤΡΑΣ Harris and Mingana (op. cit., vol. ii, p. 139; cf. p. 99) have drawn atten tion to the presence in the Syriac of what 'at first sight, at all events, appears to be Semitic paronomasia' here and elsewhere in the Odes. Now, however, the question is complicated by the fact that the Greek too contains a play on words, as it does in verses 1-3 ; and it may be added that Carmignac, like Grimme before him, has no difficulty in conjecturing a play on words in his reconstructed Hebrew text of verse 5. It might therefore be thought that the argument for paronomasia in this verse is irrelevant to the question of the original language. Never theless, the new evidence does make a contribution to the discussion. It confirms the opinion derived from the study of the Syriac Odes that the poet was interested in a play on words and encourages the reader to believe that the other examples that have been detected were in tended by him; the opinion is further confirmed by the presence, noted above, of a different kind of play on words in verses 1-3. If that is so, then a fresh value as evidence is acquired by examples of play on words that are found in Syriac but are unlikely to have existed in Greek. Harris and Mingana (op. cit., vol. ii, p. 169) refer, for instance, to the appearance of A^rC, n«d\\, r&lt;LÙ\ , and in Ode xxxv, and it is not at once obvious how this particular play on words could have been 1 R. Duval, La littérature syriaque (Paris, 1899), p. 36, and A. Baumstark, Geschichte der syrischen Literatur (Bonn, 192a), p. 18.</page><page sequence="6">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 377 achieved in Greek, or, for that matter, in Hebrew (it is not reproduced in Grimme's reconstruction of the Hebrew). As they say, 'it may be bad philology, but it is Syriac philology'. The further question now arises whether the Greek text of this clause contains an allusion to the LXX. J. Daniélou1 has pointed out that the phrase ΣΤΕΡΕΑ ΠΕΤΡΑ in the Ode is also found in the LXX of Deut. xxxii. 13 and Isa. 1. 7; the Epistle of Barnabas vi. 3 quotes the latter passage and applies it to Christ. Chapter xi of the Epistle also uses the word πέτρα in a quotation of the Old Testament and goes on to speak of water, and this reminds Daniélou of the reference to waters in Ode xi. 6 ; in particular, the words ΑΠΟ ΠΗΓΗΣ ΖΟΗΣ in the Ode resemble Barnabas's quotation of πηγήν ζωής horn]ei. ii, 13. There is undoubtedly a similarity of thought between the two passages, but it is probably un necessary to postulate literary dependence of the Ode on the Epistle, and Daniélou does not make such a claim. Nor does he argue that, be cause the Ode quotes the LXX, it must have been composed in Greek,2 but the evidence collected by him might be thought by some to point in that direction. If the Greek Ode is dependent on the LXX, the ques tion is whether the poem was composed in Greek with the Greek Old Testament in mind, or whether a translator from Syriac into Greek used a familiar biblical phrase. There is nothing in Ode xi. 5 that shows the verse to be dependent in thought on a reading found only in the LXX. On the other hand, στεριά πέτρα occurs several times in the Greek Bible (Isa. ii. 21, v. 28, li. 1) in addition to the places mentioned by Daniélou. Similarly, πηγή ζωής is found a number of times : Ps. xxxv (xxxvi). 9, Prov. xiii. 14, xiv. 27, xvi. 22, xviii. 4, Ecclus. xxi. 13, Jer. xvii. 13 (cf. the Song of Sol. iv. 15). Both expressions are therefore the kind of phrase that might well have come to the mind of a translator seeking a suitable rendering of the Syriac, and they do not prove that Greek was the original language. The Syriac Ode does not use words that are clearly chosen with the Old Testament in mind. The strong probability that the LXX is echoed in the Greek Ode seems to be con nected with the fact that ΖΟΗΣ is found in verse 6, although there is nothing corresponding to it in the Syriac ; in verse 7, however, the Greek does not repeat the idea, but the Syriac adds ndxu after rdjLsa. So far, the evidence from play on words in verse 5 has appeared com patible with either a Greek or a Syriac origin. Vôôbus, however, has argued that the verse must have been composed in Syriac. His opinion 1 Recherches de science religieuse, xlix (1961), p. 577. 2 In an article written before the publication of the Greek Ode, Daniélou regards a Syriac origin as possible; see H. Cazelles (éd.), Supplément au diction naire de la Bible, vol. vi (Paris, i960), col. 677.</page><page sequence="7">378 J. A. EMERTON that the Greek has lost the poetic charm of the Syriac is perhaps sub jective, but he also advances a stronger argument: the Syriac can mean 'Wahrheit' as well as 'Festigkeit', whereas the Greek ΣΤΕΡΕΑ has only the latter meaning. The Greek thus loses some of the inten tionally rich ambiguity of the Syriac and is therefore, he thinks, likely to be secondary. Vôôbus's argument is sound but in need of expansion. The point is not merely that the Syriac phrase can mean either 'the firm, solid rock' or 'the rock of truth', whereas the Greek can mean only 'the hard, solid rock' ; it is that 'truth' is a concept which is frequently found in the Odes and which is expressed by the word rC'ûï. in the Syriac text. It may be added that the presence of the idea of 'truth' in the Odes is attested by the Greek of verse 3 which has OA Ο Ν ΑΛΗΘΙΑΣ, where the Syriac equivalent is riiii-i Ktuiordrj. The Syriac of xi. 5 thus contains an idea that is characteristic of the Odes but is lacking in the Greek text of the verse. Moreover, the likelihood that with its two meanings is original is strengthened by comparison with the double entendre found in both the Syriac and the Greek of verses 1-3. It seems more probable that the Syriac of verse 5 is original than that the very frequency of the word elsewhere in the Odes has influenced a translator from the Greek. A further support for the originality of the Syriac may be derived from a comparison with Ode xxxviii. 16 which, like xi. 5, begins with It is unlikely to be a coincidence that xxxviii. 15 ends with nfiir. in a context where it must mean 'the truth'. The placing of two cognate words next to each other is in accor dance with the fondness for a play on words which is a characteristic of the composer of the Odes, and it cannot here be reproduced with the Greek words used in xi. 5, since they would not both give the meaning required by the context. Finally, Wisd. vi. 22, on which Ode xi. 5 is perhaps dependent, has a word meaning 'truth' in the LXX as well as in the Peshitta. The conclusion should therefore be drawn that the Syriac of the first line of verse 5 is more likely to be original than the Greek. Vôôbus advances a further argument for the originality of the Syriac of verse 5. He raises the question how the Greek came to have the pre position ΑΠΟ which seems strange in the context, and he suggests that it may have arisen from a Syriac original. He puts forward the hypothesis that rCs^cix. was read as ^ ν»τ\ and that it was understood to mean 'by the rock' after a passive verb. The theory is ingenious but, as is so often the case in discussions of the original language of the Odes,</page><page sequence="8">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 379 the evidence is capable of being explained in more than one way. Carmignac suggests that the Greek is a corruption of ΕΠΙ, and his explanation seems as good as that of Vôôbus; indeed, it has the advan tage of supposing that the Greek once made better sense than, on Voôbus's view, it does now. If the present reading of the Greek is ex plained in Carmignac's way, it has no bearing on the question of the original language of the Ode, since the Greek text could have been cor rupted either after it was translated from the Syriac or after the Syriac was translated from it. In any case, it should not be regarded as certain that the Greek text cannot yield a reasonable sense as it stands. The choice of the verb was, of course, determined by the desire to have a play on words, and I am indebted to Professor G. R. Driver for the suggestion that the force of the preposition is that the poet is hanging from a rock and clinging to it. He compares Homer's εκ δίφροω καθήμενος, 'seated clinging to a chariot', which came to mean little more than 'seated in a chariot'. The conclusions of this discussion of verse 5 may now be summarized. First, if—as seems possible, but not certain—the verse is dependent on Wisd. vi. 22, then it is more easily explained on the hypothesis of a Syriac original. Second, the fact that both Greek and Syriac contain a play on words favours the originality of paronomasia elsewhere, and such paronomasia sometimes supports the belief in a Syriac original. Third, the Greek text is probably dependent on the LXX, but the dependence can be attributed to a translator as easily as to an author. Fourth, the fact that the Syriac play on words includes the idea of 'truth' strongly favours its originality. Fifth, ΑΠ Ο can be explained as the result of either an inner-Syriac or an inner-Greek corruption, though there is no insuperable objection to the Greek as it stands. The argu ments thus seem, on the whole, to support the originality of the Syriac. Verse 6 The meanings of the Syriac and of the Greek appear to be very similar in the first line of verse 6: cv.six3 ecdVsa KAI TO [Υ]ΑΩΡ TO ΛΑΛΟΥΝ ΗΓΤΙ[ΣΕ] ΠΡΟΣ ΤΑ ΧΕΙΛΗ ΜΟΥ The Greek yields a possible sense if the verb is translated 'came near, approached'. Yet a better sense is offered by the Syriac, for the Syriac verb can mean, not only 'drew near', but also 'touched', and it is better to say that the waters touched the poet's lips than that they merely drew near them. Such a meaning cannot, perhaps, be excluded from the</page><page sequence="9">380 J. Α. EMERTON Greek, since, when used transitively, the verb can mean 'to bring near, to bring up to', and Liddell and Scott quote an example in which it is used with the dative of bringing kisses to the lips; it is therefore con ceivable that it could here be used intransitively with the preposition ΠΡΟΣ to mean 'came up to'. Nevertheless, the balance of probability seems to be that the Greek text contains a Semitism and that the Syriac is original. Verses 8 and 9 . rdèvn&gt; "ino àxnzir. r^a»TSio à&gt;cA iuJLaètPCO But I abandoned vanity; And I turned towards the Most High. The Syriac text thus contains two verbs, but the Greek has only one : AAA ΕΞΕΊΡΑΠΗΝ ΤΩΝ ΜΑΤΕΩΝΕΠΙ TON ΥΨΙΣΤΟΝ. Vôôbus thinks that the passage testifies clearly to the originality of the Syriac. In the first place, he maintains that the defectiveness of the Greek is shown by a comparison with the following verses, which expound more fully the theme of the passage, namely, the abandonment of vanity as folly, and the fruits of repentance. The argument is not very strong. It is true that Àmax., the only Syriac word that has nothing corresponding to it in the Greek, is also found in verse 1 o, where the Greek has Α ΦΗΚΑ ; but it is not necessary to suppose that the writer must always have ex pressed an idea in precisely the same words, and the Greek of verses 8 f. implies that vanity was abandoned when it says that the poet turned from it. Secondly, Yoobus maintains that the Syriac is better metrically. This argument is more weighty than the first, although it is difficult to be sure what is to be expected of a writer trying to compose in Greek a Semitic type of poetry. Verse 10 And I abandoned folly which is cast (rd»sx.) over the earth, And I stripped it off and cast it (chiv»:ix-0) from me. The Syriac text uses the verb K'.tx. in two different senses, and such a play on words is characteristic of the Odes (Harris and Mingana, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 101-3) and may be compared with the different kinds of word-play in verses 1-3 and 5. The play is lost in the Greek, which has the words KEIMENHN and ΕΡΙΨΑ, and also, it may be added, in Carmignac's Hebrew restoration (HSIS and rcVwi).</page><page sequence="10">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 381 Verse II And the Lord renewed me in his clothing, And possessed me (&gt;UuQ) in his light. The use of the verb r£in in the Syriac text has long appeared strange, and the fact that Harris and Mingana suggest in vol. i that ,ΛΙα^Ο should be read and mention Frankenberg's emendation in their notes on the verse in vol. ii testifies to their uneasiness about it. The Greek, however, has a verb that makes better sense: Κ AI ΑΝΕΚΤΗΣΑΤΟ ME. The verb can mean 'to refresh, revive' (cf. Liddell and Scott, ad loc.), which suits the context well. Yet it can also mean 'to regain for oneself, to recover', and Klijn1 points out that the Syriac can be explained as a translation of the Greek understood in that sense. He notes that the verb κτάσθαι is sometimes translated rdo in the Syriac New Testament. Here, then, for the first time in the present discussion, is a good argument prima facie for the priority of the Greek. Nevertheless, the Syriac is not totally impossible, and Klijn's explana tion might be used the other way round to account for the way in which the Greek translates the Syriac. Verse 12 The Syriac text contains the words \ iu re^.i »A.»xUr&lt; which may be translated, 'he gave me incorruptible rest (or, refreshment)'. In contrast, the Greek has Κ ΑΙ ΑΝΕΖΩΟΠΟΙΗΣΕΝ ME ΤΗ ΑΦΘΑΡ ΣΙΑ ΑΥΤΟΥ. As Klijn (op. cit.) points out, the difference in mean ing between the Syriac and the Greek verbs is probably to be explained as the result of a confusion between QwOrc', from the root jjCU, 'to rest', and kiuirC', from rdm, 'to live'. Vôôbus once again has no doubt about the originality of the Syriac. First, he says that what the context demands is a new creation, not merely a renewal ('Wieder holung'), but his objection to the Greek is unconvincing, since it may be doubted whether the idea of 'life' is as weak as he appears to suppose. Second, he maintains that it is impossible to explain how the Syriac arose from the Greek, whereas the Greek can be accounted for as the translation of a Syriac original in which the roots ucu and rdui had been confused. However, the explanation will work either way: it is equally possible that a translator from Greek into Syriac wrote ^lujrC and that a copyist corrupted it to &gt;1^^. Third, Vôôbus argues that the idea of 'rest' is more likely to be original, because it is an important 1 Nederlands Theologisch Tijdschrift, xiv (1959-60), p. 448.</page><page sequence="11">382 J. A. EMERTON concept in the Odes and in related literature. The objection to this argu ment is that the theme of 'life' is also important, as a study of the many examples of ι&lt;ω and its cognates listed by Harris and Mingana in their concordance shows. Vôôbus's further argument that the Greek under stands the ΑΦΘΑΡΣΙΑ to be God's, and that it thus misses the true meaning of the ascetic ideal connected with 'rest', is dependent on the view that 'rest' is original, which is the very point at issue. He has thus not succeeded in proving that verse 12 testifies to the originality of the Syriac text. Verse 15 The Syriac text of verse 15 says that the poet's breath or breathing took pleasure 'in the pleasant fragrance (rtLsaxttas cruris) of the Lord'. According to the Greek, however, his breath ( ΑΝΑΠΝΟΗ) rejoiced 'in the fragrance of the kindness (EN ΕΥΩΔΙΑ ΧΡΗΣΤΟ ΤΗΤΟΣ) of the Lord'. Vôôbus argues that the Greek is secondary, since it has avoided the anthropomorphism of the Syriac, and he draws attention to other evidence in Syriac literature for the concept of God's 'pleasant fragrance'. While it can hardly be claimed that the argument is decisive, such evidence as this tells in favour of a Syriac original and can acquire cumulative force if enough of it is found.

The Greek text of verse 20 and the first part of 21 contains a some what different construction : ΙΔΟΥ ΟΙ ΕΡΓΑΖΟΜΕΝΟΙ ΣΟΥ ΚΑΛΟΙ ΜΕΤΑΒΟΛΑΣ ΠΟΙ ΟΥΣ IN ΑΓΑΘΑΣ ΑΠΟ ΤΗΣ ΠΟΝΗΡΙΑΣ ΕΙΣ ΧΡΗΣΤΟΤΗΤΑ. Testuz translates the passage as follows: Voici, tes ouvriers excellents accomplissent de bonnes transformations, (Ils changent) ce qui était mauvais en choses précieuses. The Greek thus makes the workmen turn what was evil into what is good, instead of themselves turning from wickedness to God's pleasant ness, as in the Syriac. Both Adam (op. cit., p. 150) and Vôôbus believe that the Greek is secondary. Not all their arguments are equally strong; thus ΧΡΗ ΣΤΟΤΗΤΑ, even if Vôôbus is justified in regarding it as pale and lacking in the 'Lebendigkeit' of the Syriac, is not therefore necessarily less original. Nor is there any need to follow them in maintaining that ΑΓΑΘΑΣ should not be applied to ΜΕΤΑΒΟΛΑΣ, but only to people. A further problem is raised by the words ΜΕΤΑΒΟΛΑΣ ΠΟΙΟΥΣΙΝ ΑΓΑΘΑΣ which correspond to ^i!\^coo . in the Syriac text. Adam and Vôôbus claim that the expression ΜΕΤΑ ΒΟΛΑΣ ΠΟΙΟΥΣΙΝ is strange Greek. On the other hand, there is evidence for a tendency in popular Hellenistic usage to replace the middle by the active voice in 'the idiomatic use of ποιείσθαι with a noun as substitute for a verb',1 and the writer of the Greek Ode, who was in fluenced by the Greek Bible, was not ignorant of the many ways in which ποίΐΐν is used in the LXX. Vôôbus also asks which text can more easily be explained as a translation of the other, and argues that it is impossible to see how the Syriac could have arisen from the Greek, whereas the Greek can be explained as the result of the mistaken view that is a noun, rather than a participle. That still leaves the ignoring of nc'nûi». to be explained, and Vôôbus suggests that either the word had been accidentally omitted from the Syriac text because of its similarity in appearance to or, though it was in the manu script used by the translator, he overlooked it for the same reason (this 1 J.

Preisigke, Wôrterbuch der griechischen Papyrusurkunden, vol. ii (Berlin, 1927), cols. 326-32.</page><page sequence="13">384 J. A. EMERTON explanation has also been suggested by Carmignac). As an alternative to Vôôbus's explanation, it might be suggested that the translator, having misinterpreted ^.ιΛΑαπο, simply ignored k'.tSa. because he could not easily work it into his understanding of the sentence. Vôôbus also sug gests that, because the translator failed to understand the verse correctly, he had to ignore after K'àxcisaiflonX ; he apparently means that, according to the Greek understanding of the verse, what was evil was changed into something good, whereas the Syriac speaks of the labourers themselves turning to God's pleasantness. If, contrary to Vôôbus's opinion, it were believed that the Greek is original, the same argument could be used in reverse to explain why the Syriac adds The fact that the Greek has nothing corresponding to this Syriac particle will be further discussed in section II of the present paper. The second line of verse 21 also raises a problem. Vôôbus believes that the meaning of the Syriac is that the blessed ones have turned the bitterness of the trees away, not from the trees, but from themselves. He also maintains that 'the bitterness of the trees' refers figuratively to lust and marriage and that the verse thus reflects the ideals of Syrian asceticism. He regards as secondary the different idea found in the Greek: ΜΕΤΑΛΑΣΣΕΤΕ TO ΠΙΚΡΟΝ ΤΩΝ ΦΥΤΩΝ EN ΤΗ ΓΗ ΣΟΥ. Testuz suggests, doubtless rightly, that ΜΕΤΑΛΑΣΣΕΤΕ stands for ΜΕΤΑΛΑΑΣΕΤΑΙ, and he translates the clause, 'L'amertume des plantes se change'. It seems obvious to Vôôbus that the Greek reveals a failure to understand the Syriac in speaking of the bitterness of the trees being changed and in not making the workmen the subject of the verb. He suggests that the error arose partly as a result of the misunderstand ing of at the beginning of the verse and partly because was read as a plural and erroneously regarded as the subject of the verb. Vôôbus may well be right in his conclusions, and yet there are two reasons for hesitating to follow him in his reasoning. First, bitterness does not always stand for lust in the Odes. Thus, in xlii. 12 Christ is bitter ness (rC^i-So) to Sheol, and in xxviii. 15 the cognate noun ri'àtoi is used in a more general sense of wickedness or cruel treatment.1 1 In the Gospel according to the Egyptians, to which Vôôbus refers, 'bitter ness' certainly stands for sexual desire; he also mentions a passage in the Acts of Thomas—W. Wright, Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, vol. i (London, 1871), p. —which speaks of the 'bitter tree' (rC'v^SO rtflSurO in a context</page><page sequence="14">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 385 Second, the idea of removing bitterness from a plant is found in Syriac literature in a sermon of Ephraim Syrus,1 who speaks of the devil sow ing tares, and then says: 'The Good One, in his glorious paradise, sweetens their bitterness' (rcdjj» rgjj..aTJ5a cafia..ii&amp;=&gt; Even if Ephraim is quoting the Ode and has misunder stood it, his interpretation shows that the meaning attached by Vôôbus to 'bitterness' was not obvious to a Syrian writer. Thus, whether or not the Syriac is prior to the Greek, it cannot legitimately be objected that the latter contains an improbable thought. The conclusions of this examination of verses 20 and 21 may now be summarized. Although the arguments for the originality of the Syriac in verse 20 and the beginning of 21 are not conclusive, it is perhaps easier to explain the Greek as a rendering of the Syriac than to see how the latter could have been derived from the former. The arguments for the originality of the Syriac in the second line of verse 21 are even less strong. Further problems connected with verse 21 are considered immediately below. Verses 21 and 22 Verse 22 is probably the most difficult in the Ode, and no completely satisfactory solution of the problem has yet been proposed. The fol lowing discussion will draw attention to the inconclusiveness of the suggestions that have been made, and it may be doubted whether the hypothesis here advanced will be regarded by others as any more satisfactory. The problems of verse 22 cannot be discussed without considering the preceding verse once again. The lines of the two verses are dis tinguished by letters of the alphabet in the following translation of the Syriac: 21 a And turn from wickedness to thy pleasantness, b And have turned the bitterness of the trees away from them, c When they were planted in thy ground. where opposition to sexual intercourse is expressed. In the latter text, however, it is conceivable that 'bitterness' is a general term for wickedness that includes lust but is not restricted to it. For a reference to other relevant material in ancient literature, see A. F. J. Klijn, The Acts of Thomas (Leiden, 1962), p. 238. I doubt whether the passage from the Qumran scrolls which Vôôbus quotes supports him in his narrow interpretation of 'bitterness'. K. Rudolph, Revue de Qumran, iv (1963-4), p. 551, notes the following places in the Hodayoth where 'bitter ness' is mentioned: v. 32, 34, viii. 28, xi. 19, 22. * S. E. Assemani, Sancti Patris Nostri Ephraem Syri Opera Omnia, vol. vi— vol. iii of the Syriac texts—(Rome, 1743), p. 588; cf. Harris and Mingana, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 18.</page><page sequence="15">386 J. A. EMERTON 32 d And everything has become like a remnant of thee, e And an eternal remembrance of thy faithful servants. The verse division is misleading (and was changed by Harris and Mingana in their second volume) : a should go with verse 20 and will therefore be ignored in the following discussion. What remains con sists of two pairs of parallel lines, b and c, and d and e. The chief prob lem of the passage is the phrase rendered 'like a remnant of thee'. The Syriac noun means 'remainder, remnant, residue, the rest' (cf. Payne Smith, op. cit., ad loc.), and it is very difficult to find an appropriate sense for it in the present context. Since it is parallel to 'remembrance' (cdJT^O.l), it might be suggested that it denotes, not only something left behind, but also 'souvenir', 'reminder', and such an understanding of the word seems to be presupposed by the rendering 'like a remembrance of thyself' given by Harris and Mingana ; but there is no evidence for the development of this meaning, and it is very questionable. The Greek form of the passage complicates matters yet further: 21 b, c ΜΕΤΑΛΑΣΣΕΤΕ TO ΠΙΚΡΟΝ ΤΩΝ ΦΥΤΩΝ EN ΤΗ ΓΗ ΣΟΥ 22 d ΚΑΙ ΓΕΙΝΕΤΕ ΤΑ ΠΑΝΤΑ ΩΣ ΤΟ ΘΕΛΗΜΑ ΣΟΥ ΕΥΛΟΓΗΜΕΝΟΙ ΟΙ ΔΡΩΣΤΕΣ ΤΩΝ ΥΔΑΤΩΝ ΣΟΥ e ΚΑΙ ΜΝΙΑΙ ΛΙΩΝΕΙ ΑΙ ΤΩΝ ΠΕΙΣΤΩΝ ΤΩΝ Δ ΟΥΛΩΝ ΣΟΥ. Apart from disagreements that have already been discussed, there are three principal differences. First, the Greek equivalent to the difficult Syriac is TO ΘΕΛΗΜΑ. Second, the Greek adds another line between d and e. Third, b and c are telescoped together, and so, despite the Greek addition, the total number of lines remains the same. Klijn1 and Philonenko- maintain that the newly discovered manu script contains evidence for the secondary character of the Syriac. They argue that it can be explained as a translation of an inner-Greek cor ruption: TO ΘΕΛΗΜΑ may have been corrupted to TO ΛΕΙΜΜΑ, which would have been correctly translated rdi^vc-. Such a corrup tion is possible, though the two Greek words are not so very similar that all doubt is removed. However, to draw attention to the possibility of an inner-Greek corruption does not prove that the Syriac is secondary ; it could be suggested that TO AEIMMA was the original Greek reading Nederlands Theologisch Tijdschrift, xiv (1959-60), p. 448. Zeitschrift fur die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, liii (1962), p. 264.</page><page sequence="16">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 387 and that it was a translation of the Syriac. But there is a further con sideration that might appear to settle the question in favour of Greek priority: Klijn and Philonenko maintain that the Greek text makes sense in contrast with the Syriac, and that the nonsense of the latter is best explained as dependent on a corruption of the good sense of the former. Yet the priority of the Greek line as a whole is less obvious than they suppose. Testuz is doubtless right (supposing ΓΕΙΝΕΤΕ to stand for ΓΙΝΕΤAI) in rendering the sentence, 'Et tout (y) est fait suivant ta volonté' ; but the use of ΩΣ does not appear natural in Greek (cf. Adam, op. cit., p. 150), and it looks suspiciously like a translation of which is good Syriac in the context. Therefore, whatever may be thought about the noun most appropriate to the line, the use of ΩΣ tells strongly in favour of the view that the Greek Ode is a translation of the Syriac. An opinion very different from that of Klijn and Philonenko is held by Vôôbus. He maintains that it 'sogar mit Hânden zu greifen ist' that the Syriac is original. The Greek translator was, he suggests, as puzzled as modern readers by the Syriac and he had to extract, or rather to insert, what sense he could. Seeing the verb an è\rï^ in the previous verse, he was reminded of the Syriac word for 'will' (presumably and so he rendered rCLtaix- as TO ΘΕΛΗΜΑ. This theory that a translator simplified a difficult passage may be set alongside the argument that the Greek is more original because more meaningful, but Vôôbus's suggestion has the weakness that the Syriac is left without a satisfactory explanation. He does, indeed, refer with approval to Harnack's1 theory that people can share in God's being and so become like parts ('Teile') of God, but the explanation is not very convincing: rdi^Tt- does not mean 'parts', and it is not clear why 70 ,%So\a should be used of people in a context that applies more ob viously personal terms to human beings. The same weakness is found in Adam's discussion of the verse (op. cit., pp. 150 f.). Since the Greek contains an unusual expression, he believes that it is secondary and suggests that it arose from a misunderstanding of the Syriac, but he does not explain how the misunderstanding arose or what the Syriac means. Yet another explanation has been offered by Carmignac who, al though he believes that the Odes were originally written in Hebrew, has 1 A. Harnack and J. Flemming, Ein jiidisch-christliches Psalmbuch aus dem ersten Jahrhundert (Leipzig, 1910), p. 41.</page><page sequence="17">388 J. A. EMERTON suggested that reUa.ii, is the result of an inner-Syriac corruption. He holds that a word meaning 'will' is original, and has proposed the view that the present Syriac is a corruption of Carmignac's sug gestion does not seem probable: although the two words end in the same way, the beginnings do not resemble each other, and confusion is not very likely. It is presumably because Carmignac himself is not satis fied with the theory that he now appears to have abandoned it.1 Before attempting to carry the discussion further, it must be asked whether c or e should be regarded as the parallel to d, and which is therefore more likely to throw light on its meaning. The answer to that question depends on the answer to the further question whether the additional line in the Greek is original. The meaning of the additional line is not difficult to determine. Testuz suggests that ΔΡΩΣΤΕΣ should be read as ΔΡΑΣΤΑΙ (Car mignac prefers ΔΡΩΝΤΕΣ), and his suggestion, which is confirmed by a comparison with vi. 13, is probably right. He then offers the transla tion, 'Bénis soient ceux qui sont préposés à tes eaux'. More than one scholar has observed that there is a similarity between the additional line and Ode vi. 13 : -. reuivrsa ocn.i ,cncux»3xZ9al A*àcn . ,00 COM O.UMaOn^rC'.l ^ CVJCT3 Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, Those that have been entrusted with his water. There are, indeed, a number of similarities between Ode xi and vi. 13. Thus Ode xi speaks in verses 6 ff. of the waters, and in verse 18 (which is linked with verse 21, shortly before the additional line, by a reference to planting) uses the same word for 'Blessed'. Similarly, the word in verse 22 recalls cui*L»cnA&gt;rC:i in vi. 13, and in verse 22 suggests the same thought as tcriftiaeJsttataal The simi larities between the two passages can be interpreted in two ways. In the first place, they can be regarded as evidence that the additional line, which is thus in keeping with the thought of Ode xi, is original. Secondly, they can be explained as the reason why a scribe was reminded of vi. 13 and added it as a gloss. Alternatively, it is possible that the line 1 In Revue de Qumran, iv (1963-4), pp. 429 ff., he suggests a confusion be tween mNtP and ΓΥΠΉ1Ρ, but his new solution of the problem is satisfactory only if the very doubtful theory that the latter Hebrew word can mean 'will' is accepted.</page><page sequence="18">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 389 was added by a translator from Syriac into Greek. He understood d in a way that made it the parallel to b-c; but that left e hanging in the air, and so the translator inserted as a parallel a line borrowed from vi. 13. Against the hypothesis of a scribal or translator's addition borrowed from vi. 13, however, is the fact that the Greek of verse 22 has ΕΥΛΟΓΗ ΜΕΝΟΙ, whereas we should expect MAKAPEIOI, which corresponds to «. ocrnrj£t\j in verse 18. A further reason for thinking that the additional line is original1 is that it makes better sense of e. According to the Syriac text, line e means 'everything has become ... an eternal remembrance of thy faithful servants', and it is difficult to understand so obscure a statement. On the other hand, it makes good sense, if the additional line is supplied, to bless first the ministers of God's waters and then the remembrance of them. The waters referred to are presumably those of verses 6 ff., possibly the waters of baptism. While the principle difficilior lectio potior must not be forgotten, there is thus good reason to think that the additional line is a genuine part of the poem. If it is, the conclusion should not be drawn that the Syriac Ode as a whole is necessarily secondary. It is possible that the line once existed in Syriac and that it was lost by homoioteleuton. Since the Greek has ΕΥΛΟΓΗΜΕΝΟΙ, the Syriac of the additional line would probably have had which perhaps goes more naturally than ^ ocnxacù^ with the impersonal noun A possible objection to the originality of the Syriac must now be considered. If a line is added between d and e, it might be thought better to keep the total number of lines the same by telescoping b and c with the Greek. However, there is no objection to supposing that the three lines b, c, and d go together, since there is other evidence in the Odes for the grouping of lines in threes. Thus, the Syriac of verses 1 and 23 of Ode xi is best arranged in this way. Similarly, if Testuz's arrangement of the Greek text, which is based on signs in the manu script, is correct, such a grouping is found in the second half of verse 3 together with verses 4 and 5, while verses 6-9 and 13-16a form strophes each with an odd number of lines. Although it does not here have any value as evidence for the originality or otherwise of the Greek, it may also be noted that the more compact Greek of line b-c is comparable to 1 Carmignac argues for its authenticity on the ground of its symmetry with 'Bienheureux!' in verse 18 and 'Voici!' in verse 20, but I cannot detect much symmetry in the arrangement, and it is not very apparent in his Hebrew restora tion, where he puts the first two exclamations each at the beginning of a stanza but the third in the second line of a stanza. cc</page><page sequence="19">390 J. A. EMERTON the fact that the Greek text is shorter in verses 8 f., as was noted above, and that it appears in some verses to compress into a single line what is best understood as two in the Syriac. If the opinion that the additional line is original is correct, line d must be understood in a way that fits its parallel line c. It is possible that the meaning 'will' found in the Greek is original, for it fits the context well. Yet, as has been seen, the strangeness of ΩΣ suggests that the Greek is a translation. The Syriac of verse 22 might be explained in the way suggested by Klijn and Philonenko, if we were to follow Baumgartner in believing that the Syriac is a translation from Greek, but that the Greek, in turn, is a rendering of a Semitic original. Against this view, however, there is evidence elsewhere in the Odes that appears to testify to a Syriac original; moreover, there is no direct evidence for the existence of the Odes in any Semitic language other than Syriac, and it is desirable not to postulate such a work unless there is no satis factory alternative. It must therefore be asked whether it is possible to account for the evidence on the hypothesis of a Syriac original of verse 22. It is difficult to see how rdl^ir. could have arisen out of a Syriac word meaning 'will', but there is no difficulty in explaining the Greek reading either as a corruption of TO ΛΕΙΜΜΑ or, to follow Vôôbus, as a guess at the meaning of an obscure Syriac text. But that leaves the reading of the Syriac to be explained, and it has been seen that the weakness of the discussions of the verse by Adam and Vôôbus is that they have no satisfactory suggestion to make. A new explanation of the Syriac is therefore needed, and a conjecture may be tentatively pro posed. It may be suggested that the Syriac originally read, not but a noun meaning 'a field, a piece of land, a farm' (cf. Payne Smith, op. cit., ad loc.). The meaning of line d would then have been, 'And everything has become like thy field'. The reading yields a sense in keeping with the agricultural imagery of the Ode, and com parable to that of the second line of verse 12, the Syriac text of which may be rendered, 'And I became like the ground which sprouteth and rejoiceth in its fruits'. The first three words are rd^irC' èuoeno, and thus consist of the verb used at the beginning of verse 22, then the same particle, and then a word meaning 'ground' or 'land'. The Greek too of verse 12 is comparable to that of verse 22 : ΕΓΕΝΟΜΗΝ ΩΣ ΓΗ. If K'iîn.nc'was the original reading in verse 22, it is easy to see how the corruption may have arisen. A scribe perhaps assimilated the end of the word to that of rdiVvO.lO later in the verse, and wrote ρθΛΛΧ-rc'. A later scribe was puzzled by the word, but the letters suggested to him that rdJAix. was intended, and he corrected it accordingly.</page><page sequence="20">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 391 The conclusions to be drawn from an examination of verse 22 may now be summarized. First, the strange use of ΩΣ suggests that the Greek text is a translation. Second, it is not easy to see how rdi^ix, could have arisen out of a Syriac word meaning 'will', whereas the Greek can be explained as a corruption or a guess. Third, the additional line in the Greek is probably a genuine part of the poem. Fourth, if the Syriac text is prior to the Greek, it may be conjectured that is a corruption of nsSskX.K'. Verse 24 riLsaaoAa rCcrAri' v·^ r*tix=&gt;C\X. Praise be to thee, Ο God, the pleasure that is in the eternal paradise. There is general agreement about the translation of the first three Syriac words in the verse, but Adam (op. cit., pp. 149, χ 51) has proposed a render ing of the last three different from the one given above. He thinks that rel2axfloci=3 is in the nominative case and that the words express a wish, like those at the beginning of the verse, and he translates them, 'Erquik kung (sei) im Paradiese immerdar !' This way of understanding the words is most improbable. For one thing, the translation ignores the letter dalath at the beginning of For another, it is not justifiable to supply 'sei' in the second half unless is understood there as in the first half ; the meaning would then be, 'Erquickung (sei dir) im Paradiese immerdar!' But it does not seem appropriate to wish God rdsaflofta, that is, 'gladness, delight, felicity' ; the pleasure is more probably what he gives to man. It is therefore better to suppose that the word is in apposition to 'God' and that the verse should be translated in the way I have suggested. The Syriac certainly makes good sense, which is more than can be said for the Greek: ΔΟΞΑ ΣΟΙ ΤΩ ΘΩ ΠΑΡΑΔΙΣΩ ΣΟΥ ΤΡΥΦΗΣ ΕΩΝΙΑΣ. Since the Greek yields no sense, Adam maintains that it cannot be the language in which the Ode was written. But his objection to the originality of the Greek proves too much. It is normally to be assumed that a translator intended his rendering to mean something, unless, like Aquila, he adopted a principle of translating in a slavishly literal way. Yet the present text does not make sense, and cannot be accounted for as a word-for-word rendering of the Syriac: the order of the words is different, and it is not easy to see why the Syriac should have led a translator to put ΠΑΡΑΔΙΣΩ in the dative case. Nor is it</page><page sequence="21">392 J. A. EMERTON easy to accept Vôôbus's view that the translator misunderstood the Syriac, unless he believed himself to have some understanding of it. There is therefore good reason to suppose that the Greek was intended to make sense and that, since it does not now do so, its text has not been preserved intact. Testuz suggests that Τ Ω WQ is an error for EN ΤΩ, and translates the verse : 'Gloire à toi en ton paradis de délices éternel les'. Alternatively it may be suggested that EN ΤΩ has dropped out by homoioteleuton. If the Greek doxology had, before its corruption, wished God praise in his paradise, its meaning would have been acceptable. Whether or not such an emendation is adopted, there is good reason to suspect that the text as it now stands is corrupt, and it is highly unsatis factory to argue with Adam and Vôôbus for the priority of the Syriac on the basis of a comparison with a doubtful Greek reading. There is another consideration, which both Adam and Vôôbus appear to have overlooked: the expression ΠΑΡΑΔΙΣΩ . . . ΤΡΥΦΗΣ has been bor rowed from the LXX. It will, however, be best to postpone a discussion of this subject until section III. Apart from the use of a phrase taken from the LXX, the doxology thus does not help us to decide which is the original language. II One of the scholars who argued earlier in the century for a Greek origin of the Odes was Dom R. H. Connolly. He maintained, among other things, that with a pronominal suffix is sometimes used in the Odes in a way contrary to Syriac idiom. Strictly speaking, he said,1 'it should not be used (in cases where a possessive suffix is grammatically possible) except to give some sort of prominence to the possessor or to emphasize the fact of possession'. Indiscriminate use 'after a noun, and equivalent to μον, αύτοΰ, in the same position, is frequent in translations from Greek (though not in the earliest), but is hardly met with in native Syriac works'. He gave as examples of improper use in the Odes those found in viii. 20 (second occurrence), xii. 4, xvii. 12, 14, xxv. 2, xxvi. 2, xxviii. 10, and rOwir&lt;=3 in xi. 21. In view of Connolly's ex tensive acquaintance with Syriac literature, his opinion on the matter is very weighty. It must now be asked whether any fresh light is thrown on the question by a study of the Greek Ode, and the opportunity will be taken to reconsider the whole question of the use of s in the Syriac text. 1 jf.T.S. xiv (1913), p. 537- For a different view, see A. Mingana, Zeitschrift fiir die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, xvi (1915), pp. 189 f.</page><page sequence="22">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 393 The particle is used three times in the Syriac text of Ode xi: v^·» S and c&lt;X.ir£a in verse 21, and ρ^ιδϊχ. il in verse 22. The second phrase is one of Connolly's examples v&gt;^ of the improper use of Λλ.ί, and it is not to be supposed that he would have viewed the others with greater favour. The corresponding Greek words are ΕΙΣ ΧΡΗΣΤΟΤΗΤΑ, EN ΤΗ ΓΗ ΣΟΥ, and ΤΟ ΘΕΛΗΜΑ ΣΟΥ, respectively. It is unnecessary here to raise again the problem of the meaning and textual history of the third noun in the series, which has been discussed above. The sur prising fact about the Greek is that the first noun is not followed by ΣΟΥ, although the Syriac has Thus a Syriac expression which Connolly believes to be characteristic of translations from Greek is found in a place where the Greek text lacks the word to which it is supposed to correspond. It is true that the Greek text does not always appear to be in a perfect state of preservation, and it might be suggested that ΣΟΥ has been lost by scribal carelessness. But it was noted above that Vôôbus is probably right in believing that the absence of 'thy' from the Greek and its presence in the Syriac are integrally related to the different understandings of turning in the two texts. Alternatively, it might be suggested that the Syriac translator introduced under the influence of the other occurrences in his translation of the verse; yet he could easily have used a simple suffix, as he does later in verse 22 and elsewhere in the Ode. The evidence of the Greek Ode thus tells against Connolly. Another significant fact appears from a comparison of the Greek with the Syriac of Ode xi: although ΣΟΥ twice corresponds to in verses 21 f., the Greek frequently has ΜΟΥ, ΣΟΥ, ΑΥΤΟΥ, or ΑΥΤΗΣ elsewhere in the Ode where the Syriac has a simple pronominal suffix ; later in verse 22, for example, the Greek has ΤΩΝ Δ ΟΥΛΩΝ ΣΟΥ and the Syriac y^.Tivi. Such a simple suffix is, indeed, regular in the Syriac Odes, and the use of A».t is relatively uncommon. That raises the question whether the use of the Syriac expression is as indiscriminate as Connolly suggests. Before the way in which it is employed in the Odes is examined, the point may be made that, in any case, a writer in</page><page sequence="23">394 J· A. EMERTON Syriac, possibly living in a bilingual region in Syria, may have under gone Greek influence on his style (cf. Vôôbus, op. cit., p. 278). He certainly makes use of the particles and which had been borrowed from Greek : they are used sixty-four and twenty-three times respectively, according to the concordance of Harris and Mingana. It is therefore conceivable that the influence of Greek style may have led him to use rather more frequently than would otherwise have been the case. The concordance records that Aj.i is used twenty-three times in the Odes. Some of these examples can be excluded from the discussion (and Connolly does not claim that every instance is contrary to Syriac idiom), since they are used in a different way from the one under discussion : the expression is employed predicatively in eight places, vii. 12, viii. 20 (first occurrence), xxiv. 6, xxvi. 1, 5, 6, 7, xlii. 20, to which can be added viii. 14, where &gt;l»:i means 'from those that are mine'. The number can be reduced by a further eight, because the use can some times be explained as intended to give some emphasis to the suffix: viii. 16 (bis), 18, 20 (second occurrence), xi. 21 f. (ter), xvii. 9, of which that at viii. 20 and one of those in xi. 21 appear in Connolly's list. It must be admitted that there is a subjective element in a judgement where emphasis is appropriate; but it does not seem out of place to emphasize, for example, that the pleasantness and the land are God's in xi. 21, or to say, in viii. 20, that God has set his chosen ones at his own right hand. In two of the remaining six places, where the particle is not used predicatively and where emphasisis is not so plausible, a further reason may be suggested: in xxv. 2 and xxviii. 10 (both in Con nolly's list) the line would be excessively short without it, and it may have been employed for the sake of metre. The same explanation will perhaps fit xvii. 12 (another of Connolly's examples), where the case for it is not so strong but where there may also be a desire to distinguish 'my love' (&gt;1λ.τ r£=cu») from 'my request' (,è&gt;&amp;2m) ; the latter means 'a request to me', and the suffix is thus used in a different sense from the other occurrence of 'my' in the same line. That leaves only three examples (all in Connolly's list) that still need to be explained. The expression αΛ».ι r&lt;è\a»r&lt;1» in xii. 4 may have the particle for the sake of emphasis : the phrase is the first in a series of attributes of God, and the poet may have wished to introduce a certain distinction from 'his worlds', expressed with a simple suffix, in the previous line. The particle may have been placed after tVÀvâ i as in xvii. 14 because there was a desire to emphasize the fact that it was God's blessing (though, admittedly, 'my fruits' in verse 13 does not</page><page sequence="24">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 395 receive the same emphasis), and the poet may have been influenced by the thought that ,Α-»η would balance the prepositions with the first person singular suffix in verse 13 (&gt;.=&gt;), the second half of verse 14 (, b\o\), and verse 15 (Λ)· It may also be noted that 'my blessing' corresponds in sense to 'my love' (Λ*3 rCneu») in verse 12, which was discussed above. Finally, cal*.! was perhaps added to κ,λ\χ».ιο rï&amp;vsat in xxvi. 2 partly under the influence of orA^.i.i, which is used predica tively, in verse 1, and partly in order to balance cnèteA later in verse 2. Although, as I have admitted, an attempt to decide when the use of is appropriate in particular contexts is sometimes subjective, it may be claimed that a reasonable explanation can be found for every occurrence in the Odes. The poet employed it relatively sparingly, and he does not appear to have done so indiscriminately. Its use, therefore, does not testify against composition in Syriac, especially when allow ance is made for some Greek influence on the style, even where a trans lation of a Greek text was not being made. Ill When verses 4 and 5 were examined, it was shown that the Greek Ode is not dependent on the Greek text of Wisd. vi. 22. Verses 5 and 6, however, contain Septuagintal phrases, and it was argued that they could be explained as the work of either a poet writing in Greek or a translator from Syriac into Greek. There are other quotations of the LXX in the Greek Ode, and they must now be discussed.1 Verse 3 contains the clause ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ MOI ΕΙΣ ΣΩΤΗΡΙΑΝ, which is also found in Exod. xv. 2, Ps. cxvii (cxviii). 14 (cf. 21, 28),Isa. xii. 2 (cf. lxiii. 8). The corresponding words of the Syriac Ode, ètocno rûoiaai ... Λ do not resemble the Peshitta nearly so closely. The similarity is greatest in Isa. xii. 2, but even there the wording is not identical: rtiniosX Λ rC'OcnlO. Nevertheless, the quotation of the LXX in the Greek could be explained as the work of a translator from the Syriac. In several other places, there may be a quotation from the LXX, but 1 I have used the text in H. B. Swete, The Old Testament in Greek, for the LXX, and for the Peshitta I have consulted W. E. Barnes, Pentateuchus Syriace (London, 1914), G. Diettrich, Ein Apparatus criticus zur Peiitto zum Propheten Jesaia (Giessen, 1905), W. E. Barnes, The Peshitta Psalter (Cambridge, 1904), and A. M. Ceriani, Translatio Syra Pescitto Veteris Testamenti ex Codice Ambrosiano Sec. fere VI Photolithographice Edita (Milan, 1876).</page><page sequence="25">396 J. A. EMERTON there is more uncertainty. The phrase ΟΔ ON ΑΛΗΘΙΑΣ is found in verse 3, and also in Gen. xxiv. 48, Tob. i. 3 (in the plural), Ps. cxviii (cxix). 30, and Wisd. v. 6 (cf. Ecclus. xxxvii. 15). On the other hand, it would be an obvious translation of K'iir.s r^uiorc' even if it did not occur in the LXX. Similarly, the words ΕΠΙ ΠΡΟΣΩΠΟΝ ΤΗΣ ΓΗΣ in verse 13 echo Gen. ii. 6, etc., but they correspond exactly to Αλ-, which is a natural phrase in Syriac. How ever, in view of what has been seen in verses 5 and 6, and in the earlier part of verse 3, it is probable that the words used later in verse 3 and in verse 13 were chosen because they are Septuagintal. The choice could have been made by either the composer of the Odes or a translator. It was noted in the discussion of verse 24 that the phrase ΠΑΡΑΔΙΣΩ ΣΟΥ ΤΡΥΦΗΣ has been borrowed from the LXX. The Hebrew word ]"7.S is understood to mean 'delight', and the expression |"7S is rendered παράδεισος τής τρυφης in Gen. iii. 23 f., Joel ii. 3, Ezek. xxxi. 9 (cf. xxviii. 13, xxxi. 16, 18). The fact that the Greek text of Ode xi. 24 has a phrase from the LXX does not of itself enable us to decide whether the Greek is original. A much more complicated question is raised by verse 16, which has the words Κ ΑΙ ΠΗΓΑΓΕΝ (doubtless an error for ΕΠΗΓΑΓΕΝ, as Testuz points out) ME ΕΙΣ ΠΑΡΑΔΙΣΟΝ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΟΠΟΥ Ο ΠΛΟΥΤΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΤΡΥΦΗΣ ΚΫ. Here too the Greek Ode makes use of the Septuagintal interpretation of 'Eden' as 'delight'. Yet the meaning of the verse in Syriac is very similar: . cn^aoocis.i retire" It appears that the Syriac Ode understands 'Eden' in the same way as the Greek. Yet the Peshitta treats ]"7S7 as a proper name and trans literates it , instead of translating it like the LXX. Thus in both the Greek and the Syriac Ode an Old Testament expression is inter preted in a way that is found in the LXX but not the Peshitta. That testifies, prima facie, to the originality of the Greek Ode. Before considering further the apparent evidence for the priority of the Greek, it may be observed that the additions to the text found in the Greek text of verse 16 contain other verbal resemblances to the story of the garden of Eden in the LXX of Genesis, and also to related passages in Ezekiel: (a) Verse 16a ΔΕΝΔΡΑ ΩΡΕΑ ---ΤΑ ΞΥΛΑ ΑΥΤΩΝ-, Gen. ii. 9 πάν ξΰλον ώραΐον (cf. Ezek. xxxi. 9, 16 f.).</page><page sequence="26">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 397 (b) Verse 16c 0 ΠΟΤΑΜΟΣ ΧΑΡΑΣΕΠΟΤΙΖΕΝ ΑΥΤΑΣ- Gen. ii. ΙΟ ποταμός Se .. . ποτίζΐΐν τον παράδεισοι*, and also ii. 6 πηγή (cf. Ode xi. 6) 8è . . . όπότιζΐν πάν τό πρόσωπον της γης (cf. Ode xi. 13). (c) Verse 16c ΚΑΙ ΚΥΚΛΩ ΤΗΣ ΓΗΣ. The text of the Greek Ode is probably corrupt, but there is a clear resemblance to Gen. ii. 11 and 13 οΰτος ό κύκλων πάσαν την γήν (cf. also Ezek. xxxi. 4). The above passages contain reasonably clear allusions to the LXX, but there are other examples that are more doubtful. Verse 16b con tains the phrase Ο ΣΤΕΦΑΝΟΣ ΑΥΤΩΝ, and the same noun is found in Ezek.xxviii. 12 before averse that has the words iv τη τρυψή τοΰπαραδεί σου. Two further doubtful examples appear in verses that do have counterparts in the Syriac text: 01 ΠΕΦΥΤΕΥΜ[Ε]ΝΟΙ in verse 18 and ΟΙ ΕΡΓΑΖΟΜΕΝΟΙ in verse 20 are derived from the Greek verbs used in Gen. ii. 8 and ii. 5, 15, iii. 23, respectively. Although not all the above examples are equally convincing, there is good evidence that the Greek Ode quotes the LXX. However, a prob lem is raised by one of them. Why is ΧΑΡΑΣ added after Ο ΠΟΤΑΜΟΣ in verse 16c ? The phrase is reminiscent of Ps. xxxvi. 9, which contains the words Dj?$n ϊρΠδ *7Π2"]. There are other affinities between this passage in the Psalter and Ode xi. Thus, Harris and Mingana (op. cit., vol. ii, p. 269) compare the drinking and drunkenness of verses 7 and 8 of the Ode with the first word in verse 9 of the Psalm (KIT); similarly, the references to the 'spring' in verse 6 and to 'his light' in verse 11 of the Ode recall Π^Π "lipp and ï|"]ÎN3 in verse 10 of the Psalm. It has also been seen that the words for 'spring of life' in verse 6 of the Greek Ode are those found in the LXX of Ps. xxxv (xxxvi). 9. In view of the resemblances between the Ode and Ps. xxxvi, it is tempting to look to the latter for the origin of ΧΑΡΑΣ. If, however, it was derived from the Psalm, it was not from the LXX version, which has καΐ τον χειμάρρουν της τρυφής σου. It would be especially surprising if the writer of the Greek Ode had avoided ΤΡΥΦΗ, despite his use of it earlier in verse 16 and in verse 24. It must therefore be asked whether the problem could be solved by postulating a Syriac original. We do not know whether this part of the Ode ever existed in Syriac, but, if it did, it might have used some of the words found in the Peshitta of Ps. xxxvi. 9: cu.rc' rCnx.Ax rdsixflarj vyLiU ^sao. It is particularly likely that the Syriac of this verse of the Ode, if it existed, would have used since it is derived from a root that appears frequently in the Syriac Odes and seems to have been a favour ite of the man responsible for them, and it might well have been</page><page sequence="27">398 J. A. EMERTON translated as ΧΑΡΑΣ in the Greek Ode. It is true that the Greek of verse 15, where the Syriac has the same adjective, uses ΧΡΗΣΤΟΤΗΤΟΣ, but that noun may have been chosen because it was thought more suitable to the context (see the discussion of the verse above). Thus, the Greek of verse 16c contains a word which may have been used under the influence of Ps. xxxvi. 9, but which has not been taken from the LXX; the Syriac text of this part of the Ode is not extant, and may never have existed, but it may have used a word from the Peshitta of the Psalm that would account for the Greek. Most of the examples of agreement between the Greek Ode and the LXX that have been discussed in this section of the present paper have been taken from verses of the Ode that are extant only in Greek. But there are also two resemblances worthy of note between the part of the Ode preserved in Syriac and the Peshitta. First, verse 15 says: My breath (&gt;àviari) took pleasure in the pleasant fragrance of the Lord. The Peshitta of Gen. ii. 7 uses the word of the breath breathed into Adam by God, whereas the word used in the Greek Ode, ΑΝΑΠΝΟΗ, is not quite so close to the LXX's πνοή. Second, verse 16 of the Ode says : And he brought me (►AaOrC'o) to his paradise. The Syriac Old Testament is not quoted exactly, but the verse re sembles in thought the Peshitta's paraphrase of the beginning of Gen. ii. 15. According to the Massoretic Text, 'the Lord God took (np_*l) the man, and put him into the garden of Eden' (R.V.), but the Peshitta substitutes for 'took' a word meaning 'led' (·*=η). The LXX, however, renders the Hebrew literally as ελαβεν. It is quite likely that the Syriac Ode here shows the influence of the Peshitta. If so, there is reason to suspect that the Greek Ode's ΠΗΓΑΓΕΝ, which has no support in the LXX, is dependent on the Syriac. The hypothesis that the Ode was composed in Syriac by a poet who sometimes alluded to the Old Testa ment without quoting verbatim would account for another fact. Verse n's words, 'the Lord renewed me in his clothing', recall the statement in Gen. iii. 21 that God clothed Adam and Eve, but the words of the Syriac Ode are not the same as those of the Peshitta. Although the lack of verbal agreement is compatible with composition in Syriac, it is not so easy to reconcile a Greek origin with the failure of the Greek Ode to quote the LXX, since the other evidence considered has shown that it normally reproduces the LXX exactly. Harris and Mingana (op. cit.,</page><page sequence="28">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 399 vol. ii, pp. 111 ff.) discuss the relation between the Odes and the Peshitta, and claim to find evidence for the use of the latter by the former. Yet in some of their examples, though the thought of the Peshitta is re produced, a synonym is used—as in the verses examined above—in place of the word found in the Old Testament. If the Odes were com posed in Syriac, this occasional substitution of synonyms appears to have been a literary method of the poet. Finally, it is necessary to look again at what appeared to be evidence for the originality of the Greek Ode, namely, the probability that both it and the Syriac Ode betray the influence of the interpretation of 'Eden' as 'delight', which is found in the LXX but not in the Peshitta. It may be doubted whether the conclusion that the Ode was composed in Greek must necessarily be drawn. Just because the Peshitta does not contain this interpretation of 'Eden', it should not be assumed that a reader of the Syriac Bible could not have known of it. Syriac has a verb ^3»^. which, in the pa'el theme, means 'to make pleasant, to delight', and the cognate noun has the meaning 'softness, delicacy' (cf. Payne Smith, op. cit., ad loc.). Since the root existed in his own language, a speaker of Syriac could easily have understood pi? in the same way as the LXX. Indeed, Ephraim Syrus makes the point clearly in his commentary1 on Genesis: ch\. It was noted above that the noun ïpni? in Ps. xxxvi. 9 is rendered rtL*s*nai-i in the Peshitta and that the root jasas is a favourite in the Syriac Odes. There is therefore no difficulty in the hypothesis that the composer of the Syriac Ode understood 'Eden' to mean 'delight' independently of the LXX and that he used r^sasocia to express the idea. It is impossible to draw unambiguous conclusions from this study of the quotations from the Old Testament. The Greek Ode contains a number of words and phrases that have been borrowed from the LXX, whereas the Syriac Ode does not show the same verbal agreement with the Peshitta. There are, however, some places where the Greek is more easily explained as secondary, and the agreements with the LXX can be accounted for as the work of a translator. Even the agreement of the Ode in both its Greek and its Syriac forms with the LXX, but against the Peshitta, in understanding 'Eden' to mean 'delight' is not in compatible with a Syriac origin. A comparison of the Ode with the Old 1 R.-M. Tonneau, Sancti Ephraem Syri in Genesim et in Exodum Comentarii (Louvain, 1955), p. 28.</page><page sequence="29">400 J. A. EMERTON Testament does not, therefore, enable us to decide the question of the language in which the Odes were composed. IV Reference has frequently been made in this paper to an article by A. Adam, and it is now time to consider the principal theses that he advances. He argues that the Odes were composed in Syriac and that the Coptic version was made from a Syriac text. However, he believes that the language in which they were composed was not the Syriac of Edessa, but a closely related dialect, and that they were originally written in the Aramaic or square script, not in the Syriac alphabet (that is, presumably, not in Estrangela). Two parts of Adam's theory will now be examined. First, he maintains (pp. 150 f.) that the Syriac text, not the Greek, is original. Unfortunately, his arguments are not always presented as fully as could be desired. Thus, he says that the parallelism of the second halves of verses 19 and 20 is 'ungriechisch', but he does not expound or give reasons for his opinion. Similarly, his discussion of verse 16c (found only in the Greek) is too brief to be satisfactory. The Greek text of this additional verse is : Κ ΑΙ Ο ΠΟΤΑΜΟΣ ΧΑΡΑΣ ΕΠΟΤΙΖΕΝ ΑΥΤΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΚΥΚΛΩ ΤΗΣ ΓΗΣ ΖΟΗΣ ΕΩΝΙΑΣ ΑΥΤΩΝ The second line is certainly difficult, and Testuz can translate it only by supplying a verb ('coulait') corresponding to nothing in the Greek. Adam suggests that the line may be a mistranslation of a Syriac text meaning, 'Und ringsum lag das Land ihres Lebens in Ewigkeit'; but he does not offer the reader a reconstruction of the postulated Syriac original, and it is therefore impossible to test the strength of his hypo thesis. When he does state his arguments more fully, their force varies. Some of his comments have already been considered in the discussion of verses 20-22 and 24, but there is a passage that has not yet been examined: verse 16b—another verse found only in the Greek—uses the noun ΣΤΕΦΑΝΟΣ of the branches of a tree. Adam objects that this is impossible in Greek, and explains it as a rendering of the Syriac kÛlAîl, which can mean 'Vollgestalt' as well as 'Krone'. But it is difficult to see why it should be regarded as impossible for a writer in Greek to think of such a figure of speech, or how a reference to the Syriac rdlAa, helps matters; I can find no evidence that the word ever means 'Voll gestalt'. Incidentally, Adam makes no mention of a fact that is worthy</page><page sequence="30">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 401 of consideration, even though it must form a parenthesis in the dis cussion of his views. The word γϊΆΑλ is used a number of times in the Odes: a crown or chaplet is worn by the blessed in v. 12, ix. 8, 9, 11, xvii. i, and particular attention may be drawn to xx. 7 f., where some of the same themes as in xi appear: And come to the paradise, and make thyself a garland from his tree, And put it upon thy head. It is in keeping with the poet's way of writing to speak of the crown of the trees in xi. 16c and to wish, at the same time, to remind his readers that the Christian's crown is to be made from a tree in God's paradise. It is doubtful, however, whether this has any bearing on the question of the language used. It is also interesting to note that the theme of crowns appears in the sermon of Ephraim Syrus that was quoted above to illustrate the idea of sweetening the bitterness of plants; Ephraim goes on at once to say of God: ^ acaiVAt caicuMO To return to Adam's article, there is more force in his argument that certain characteristics of the Greek text tell against a Greek origin : the paucity of particles, the frequent use of ΑΥΤΟΣ in the oblique cases, and what he calls 'die Voranstellung der Verbalbegriffe'. On the other hand, he believes that the extensive use of KAI may reflect popular Hellenistic usage, and that the way in which the perfect ΚΕΚΑΘΙΚΕΝ is used may also be Hellenistic. Adam may well be right in his view that the Odes were not composed in Greek—indeed, the conclusion of the present paper is that they were probably written in Syriac—but it is not easy to be sure precisely what kind of Greek is to be expected in, for example, the milieu subject to Semitic influences that Testuz has suggested. Second, I do not propose to discuss Adam's argument that the Coptic Odes were translated from the Syriac (though, even if he is right, it does not necessarily follow that the Odes were not originally composed in Greek), but only his view that the text from which the translation was made was in the square script, not in Estrangela. His principal argument is that, in vi. 9, the Coptic presupposes a dalath where the present Syriac text has waw, and he thinks that the point is confirmed by the fact that the two Syriac manuscripts of the Odes dis agree whether to read a dalath or a waw in xxiii. 17 and in xxv. 7 (where the Coptic presupposes a dalath). Adam believes (pp. 153, 155) that the confusion between these two letters is impossible in the Syriac alphabet but easily explicable in the square script. The opinion that a</page><page sequence="31">402 J. A. EMERTON confusion could not have occurred in Syriac is surprising: the letters dalath and waw are not dissimilar in Estrangela, and confusions between them are, in fact, found in manuscripts in that script.1 It is not always clear where Adam is maintaining merely that confusions between letters postulated by him would have been possible in square script and where he is arguing that they would have been more likely than in Estrangela; but it may be observed that a confusion between and v\icr)CU in vi. 9, and between (which is, it may be noted, a distinctively Syriac form) and rtiieo in vi. ι ο is no more difficult in Estrangela than in the square script. Adam's view that the Odes were written in the latter alphabet thus appears to be totally unsupported by the evidence. This unfounded opinion about the script appears to be one of his reasons for believing that the Odes were composed in a dialect other than that of Edessa. The other argument advanced by him is that the use of Λλ.ι is not in accordance with Edessene idiom; it has, however, been suggested in the present paper that this view too is mistaken. Adam has thus advanced some strong, though not conclusive, argu ments against the theory that the Odes were composed in Greek, but his view that they were originally written in the square script and that the language was a dialect different from the dialect of Edessa must be rejected. V The last subject to be discussed is the theory of Carmignac that the Odes were composed in Hebrew by a member of the Qumran sect who had been converted to Christianity.2 It would be outside the scope of the present paper to examine the many affinities of thought that he, like other scholars, detects between the Odes and the Dead Sea scrolls. Affinities of thought with a Hebrew literature are compatible with com position in a language other than Hebrew. Thus Vôôbus3 holds that Syrian Christianity and ascetical thought owe something to the Qumran sect, and that there are affinities between the Odes and the Hodayoth, but he argues that the Odes were composed in Syriac. He 1 Emerton, The Peshitta of the Wisdom of Solomon, pp. xli, xliii. 2 Op. cit., and also his essay, 'Un Qumrânien converti au Christianisme: l'auteur des Odes de Salomon', in H. Bardtke (éd.), Qumran-Probleme (Berlin, 1963), pp. 75 ff. See also A. Ehrhardt, Studia Theologica, ix (1955), p. 89, reprinted in Ehrhardt, The Framework of the New Testament Stories (Man chester, 1964), p. 106 (cf. p. 108). Testuz, op. cit., p. 58, believes that the author was an Essene, but apparently not a Christian. 3 Op. cit., pp. 275, 287, and History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient, vol. i (Louvain, 1958), pp. 17 if.</page><page sequence="32">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 403 also draws attention to similarities in thought between them and other Syriac documents. Similarly, K. Rudolph1 is able to point out resem blances in Gnostic writings. The parallels recorded by these and other scholars remind us that the similarities between the Odes and the Qumran literature are not the only factors to be borne in mind, and that they do not prove that the Odes were composed in Hebrew. Carmignac's argument, however, is not based solely on affinities of thought, or of literary form, between the Odes and the Dead Sea scrolls. He offers a reconstruction of the supposed Hebrew text of Ode xi, and gives reasons in his notes on individual verses for believing Hebrew to have been the original language. To do full justice to his theory, it would be necessary to take up his points one by one and to discuss them in detail in relation both to the Syriac and Greek texts and to his re construction of the Hebrew. It is not possible to undertake so long a task without devoting to Carmignac an amount of space disproportionate to the subjects already discussed. His arguments must therefore be dealt with briefly. First, Carmignac maintains that neither the Greek nor the Syriac is likely to be original. Like Adam, he draws attention to the paucity of particles in the Greek and to the probability that it is sometimes in ferior to the Syriac. On the other hand, he maintains that there are places where the Greek is superior to the Syriac, and therefore that the latter too is unlikely to have been the original. If the evidence thus tells against the originality of both the Greek and the Syriac, the poet must have written in another language, which was probably Hebrew. The argument thus depends on the view that sometimes the Greek and some times the Syriac is the better witness to what the poet wrote. I have examined the places where the Greek is thought by Carmignac to bé superior to the Syriac (verses 1, 3, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24), and I am not convinced that he is necessarily right. Verses 22 and 24 have been discussed above, and it has been seen how difficult it is to reach a decision. Other arguments seem to me to be equally inconclusive: for example, I see no objection to the repetition of ptfLuior^'in verse 3, and I do not regard the assonance ΘΑΛΟΥΣΑ Κ ΑΙ ΓΕΛΟΥΣΑ in verse 12 as sufficiently striking to be important. Second, he claims that there are echoes of the Hebrew Old Testa ment in verses 1 (Song of Sol. ii. 12, and Isa. xlv. 8 in the text of the A scroll from Qumran), 14 (1 Sam. xiv. 29), and 16 (Gen. ii. 15). Such allusions seem very questionable, and I have already commented on those alleged to be present in verse 1. Revue de Qumran, iv (1963-4), pp. 523 ff.</page><page sequence="33">404 J. A EMERTON Third, the alleged examples of confusion dependent on a Hebrew text are no more convincing. An instance in verse 9 may be ignored, since Carmignac himself admits that it is uncertain. Another instance— confusion between the roots 'to rest' and 'to live'—in verse 12 is also possible in Syriac, as has been seen. The other two examples are in the Greek addition to verse 16 and cannot be compared with the Syriac, but the suggestions made by Carmignac would also be possible in Syriac. Fourth, there is even less to be said for the argument that verses 19 and 21 contain examples of a Hebrew idiom, namely the use of waw consecutive with the imperfect to continue a construction begun with a participle. The Syriac text offers no difficulty, and there is no reason why it should not have been original. Fifth, the argument to which Carmignac seems to attach most impor tance is the presence of a large number of examples of rhyme, and asso nance or play on words in his reconstruction of the Hebrew text; he claims to find nineteen in all. In discussing his examples, it must be remembered that the Hebrew text has been reconstructed by Carmignac and that the examples of rhyme and word-play may be, in part at least, no more than a testimony to his own ingenuity and skill in handling Hebrew. In any case, not all his examples tell as strongly in favour of a Hebrew original as might appear at first sight. The number must be reduced by the omission of those examples that are also possible in Syriac. Thus, the Syriac text of verses 5, 18 f. (three lines ending in the second person masculine singular suffix), and 20 either has a play on words or rhyme, or can be understood to have it just as well as the Hebrew. Similarly, the assonance between DSttni and VIBOT in verse 15 seems no more probable than that between and ; in fact, neither example is very convincing. Twoof Carmignac's instances come from the Greek addition to verse 16 and cannot be compared with the Syriac; but the word-play in the reconstructed Hebrew rests on the fact that the same Greek words occur more than once, and it would be equally easy to produce a play on words by translating the Greek into Syriac. It was noted above that the example of assonance in verse 15 is not very convincing, and it may be added that a number of Carmignac's instances of word-play or assonance are rather poor (e.g. "iVan Nib2 in verse 12, and blD in verse 23). Such doubtful evidence has little value, and equally strong—or equally weak—examples can be found in the existing Syriac text: for instance . , . ,ν*»λ\Γ&lt;'ο and rCèxeuaJ^ cn= inverse x, cnàtcA rc\\o, ,b\A OA, and in verse 2, «disb reûLsao and in verse 6; and other examples could be quoted. I</page><page sequence="34">TEXT AND LANGUAGE IN ODES OF SOLOMON 405 doubt if all such Syriac words are rightly regarded as examples of deliberate assonance or word-play, but they are no less convincing than some of Carmignac's examples, and they are found, not in a recon struction, but in a text that has actually been preserved from ancient times. Carmignac's evidence is thus unconvincing; on the other hand, it was argued above that his rendering of the Ode into Hebrew has lost an example of double entendre in verses 1-3, and of the use of a root in two different senses in verse 10. It may be unfair to Carmignac to pass judgement on his learned, ingenious, and lengthy article so briefly, but I trust that I have given a clear account of the kinds of reason that lead me to question his arguments. Yet I should also like to record that his notes are often a valuable aid to the study of the Odes, and that the question of the relation between the Odes and the Qumran literature is one that deserves exploration. Concluùon The negative conclusions of the present paper can now be sum marized. First, the use of l»s does not testify to a Greek origin. Second, Adam has failed in his argument that the poet used a dialect slightly different from that of Edessa and wrote in the square script. Third, Carmignac's attempt to prove that the Greek and Syriac texts of Ode xi are translations of a Hebrew poem is unconvincing. Fourth, some arguments that have been advanced for the originality of one of the two texts in particular verses have not succeeded in proving their point: for example, it is difficult to decide whether the idea of 'rest' or that of 'life' is more original in verse 12 and either view is compatible with an origin in either language, and it is unsatisfactory to argue about verse 24 on the basis of a Greek text that is probably corrupt. It is much harder to reach clear-cut positive conclusions. Some evi dence appears, prima facie, to favour a Greek origin. A plausible argu ment can be advanced for the priority of the Greek text in verse n, although it falls short of proof. The Greek Ode contains a number of phrases from the LXX, but they may be the work of a translator rather than of the poet, and some possible echoes of the Old Testament are more easily explicable if the original language of the Odes was Syriac. It has been claimed by some that the puzzling v^r^in verse 22 is best explained as a translation of a corrupt Greek text; but it is also possible to account for the evidence on the hypothesis that the Ode was composed in Syriac, and the strange use of ΩΣ probably testifies to a Semitic original. Other evidence tells against the priority of the Greek. «21.2 od</page><page sequence="35">4o6 J. A. EMERTON The paucity of particles in the Greek text offers slight support for a Semitic original, though too high a standard of literary achievement should not be expected from a Hellenistic writer who may not have been very well educated and who may have lived in a bilingual region. In verses 21 f., it is somewhat easier to explain the Greek as a translation of the Syriac than to suppose that the latter was dependent on the former. Verse 6 makes rather better sense in the Syriac than in the Greek, and the verb in the latter can be plausibly, even if not certainly, regarded as a Semitism. The final argument is the strongest: the play on words in both Greek and Syriac in verses 1-3 and 5 favours the originality of the Syriac in verses 5 and 10, and also in other Odes where it is not always easy to see how word-play would be possible in Greek. On the whole, therefore, it is probable that the Greek is not original. That leaves the possibility that the Odes were composed either in Syriac or in some other Semitic dialect. Two considerations favour the originality of the Syriac. Virst, the Greek in verses 21 f. can be explained as a mistranslation of the Syriac. Second, we actually have a Syriac text, which contains examples of the word-play that is characteristic of the Odes, whereas there is no clear evidence for the existence of the Odes in any other Semitic language. The most probable conclusion to be drawn is that the Odes of Solomon were composed in Syriac. J. A. Emerton</page></plain_text>
