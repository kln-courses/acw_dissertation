Standing 255 feet high in the narrow confines of a remote mountain valley that is difficult of access, susceptible to flooding by spring meltwaters, and once protected by a network of mud-brick towers, the minaret's existence only came to the attention of Afghan and foreign scholars in the 1950s. Since its discovery, the minaret has attained the rank of a national symbol in Afghanistan, while assuming canonical status as a cynosure of medieval Persianate architecture among art historians. In 2002, it was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List, although this has done little to stem the widespread looting of the site. Despite its renown, the monument has remained enigmatic, its date uncertain, its</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS: FLOOD ON SOURDEL-THOMINE 537 function disputed, and its immediate archi tectural relations unknown. The inscription of Surat Maryam, an entire QurDanic chap ter (sura) relating to Mary, the mother of Jesus, on its surface is unique in the Islamic world and has further fueled speculation about the raison d'?tre of the minaret and the cultural milieu that gave rise to it.1 The mountainous province of Ghur, in which the minaret stands, was a rather mar ginal region of the eastern Islamic world that converted to Islam only in the ninth or tenth centuries?much later than many of the surrounding areas?and was famed chiefly for its large hunting dogs. Ghur en joyed a brief moment of glory in the half century after 1150, when one of the maliks (chiefs) of the region sacked Ghazna, the eponymous capital of the Ghaznavid sultans who had dominated the eastern Islamic world for almost one hundred and fifty years, and assumed the title of sultan. This dramatic event, which earned its perpetrator the sobriquet Jahan-soz (World-burner), marked the abrupt entry of these mountain chiefs onto the wider political stage and be gan their meteoric rise from regional obscu rity. The apogee of the Ghurid sultanate was reached under the reign of sultans Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad b. Sam (558 599/1163-1203) and Mucizz al-Din Muham mad b. Sam (569-602/1173-1206) of the Shansabanid clan. The brothers ruled in a condominium, with Ghiyath al-Din, the el der statesman, overseeing the westward ex pansion of the sultanate from Firuzkuh in west-central Afghanistan. Mucizz al-Din was based in Ghazna, from where he extended the sultanate's reach into the former Ghaznavid territories in the Indus Valley and into north India after 588/1192. An other line of the dynasty, famous for its pa tronage of Persian literati, ruled from Ba miyan. At its zenith in the last decade of the twelfth century, the Ghurid sultanate stretched from the Iranian metropolis of Nishapur in the west to the Indian city of Benares in the east, from the steppe of Cen tral Asia in the north to Sind in the south. The floruit of both dynasty and region was short-lived; the death of Mucizz al-Din in 1206 effectively marks the end of Ghurid power and the disintegration of the sultan ate. Since its discovery, the minaret has been recognized as the chef d'oeuvre of Ghurid patronage, whose high aesthetic values are today attested by only a handful of fragmen tary monuments scattered across Afghani stan, Pakistan, and north India. The Jam minaret is believed to be a precursor of the most famous of these, the Qutb Minar in Delhi (from 1199). Its basic elements and historical context were sketched in a brief study by Andr? Maricq and Gaston Wiet in 1959.2 A number of subsequent short arti cles have supplied further details.3 Although the minaret bears a foundation text, schol 1 The Minaret of Jam (photo: Josephine Powell Photograph, Courtesy of Historic Photographs, Fine Arts Library, Harvard College Library) arship has long been divided about its inter pretation, with opinion split between a read ing of 570/1174-75 and 590/1193-94. The latter date has long been accepted in most of the literature on the minaret, which has consequently been identified as a commem orative monument, erected after a major Ghurid victory against the Chauhan rulers of northwest India in 588/1192. In light of this id?e re?u, denunciations of idolatry and unbelief in its QurDanic inscriptions have often been read as allusions to the defeated Indian foes of the Ghurid sultans. Despite the undoubted contributions that these past publications have made to our understanding of the minaret, many ques tions remained, awaiting a definitive mono graphic study such as the present one. Ja nine Sourdel-Thomine was uniquely positioned to undertake the task, not only in her capacity as the doyenne of Islamic art history in France but also in light of her long-term interest in medieval Afghan archi tecture, architectural decoration, and epig raphy. She is particularly associated with the study of Ghurid architecture through her work on the important multiperiod palace complex at Lashkari Bazar in southern Af ghanistan and her pioneering attempt to define a Ghurid architectural style.4 In one sense, the present study continues the work of the D?l?gation Arch?ologique Fran?aise en Afghanistan, for it is largely based on documentation garnered by the architect Marc Le Berre, a member of the D?l?ga tion, during the fall of 1960, long before the Soviet invasion and consequent civil strife terminated research at the site. It also represents the culmination of decades of rumination on its subject, however, and takes full advantage of recent research on Ghurid architecture and history. The monograph is divided into four chap ters, each dealing with a different aspect of the monument. Chapter 1 considers the to pography of the site of Jam in light of the 1960 survey, as well as the contentious issue of whether the modern Jam marks the site of the destroyed Ghurid summer capital of Firuzkuh. Chapter 2 analyzes the architec ture of the monument and the formal prin ciples governing the articulation of its exte rior. Chapter 3 offers a stylistic and taxonomic analysis of its floral, geometric, and epigraphic ornament. Chapter 4 consid ers the content of its epigraphic program, including both historical and Qur?anic in scriptions. The comprehensive attention to detail throughout the work, while commendable, tends to obscure the thread of the author's argument, and concise summaries of her conclusions at the end of each chapter would have been welcome. One might also quibble with the relative dearth of cross referencing between text and image, which sends the reader scrambling at key points in the narrative, breaking its continuity. The problem is reinforced by erratic placement of the images: figure 56, which falls on page 96, is not discussed until page 133. That said, the monograph is of singular impor tance for the history of medieval Islamic architecture, rich in empirical observations and innovative hypotheses capable of recon figuring an entire art historical landscape at one fell swoop. Such insights are all the more welcome when that landscape is as dimly perceived and poorly understood as medieval Ghur. The work opens with a discussion of the immediate architectural and topographic relations of the minaret, whose apparent isolation from any monumental architec tural remains has led to speculation about its function. This problem, not unique to Jam, is also posed by other eastern Iranian and Afghan minarets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, some of which may have functioned as beacons to guide wayfarers rather than places from which the adhan, the call to prayer, was given.5 The isolation</page><page sequence="3">538 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 3 and restricted visibility of the Jam minaret renders the former function unlikely. The minaret stands on the south bank of the Hari Rud, at a point where the river val ley enlarges. The French survey of 1960 re corded a wide esplanade with a riverside containment wall of fired bricks just east of the minaret (figs. 12, 14B). The author identifies this as the remains of a possible mosque, although without addressing the somewhat idiosyncratic placement of the minaret on the qibla (Mekka-oriented) side of a mosque. The mosque may have been constructed from more ephemeral materi als, such as the mud brick and pis? from which the fortified structures on the sur rounding hillsides were built. A twelfth-cen tury minaret at Qasimabad in Iranian Sistan, which today stands in splendid isolation, was once similarly associated with a mud-brick mosque, as may also have been the case with two freestanding minarets in Ghazna that probably inspired the Ghurid minaret.6 The disappearance of a mud-brick structure, leaving a minaret constructed from more durable fired brick, would hardly be surpris ing: the destruction of the Friday Mosque of Firuzkuh, the Ghurid summer capital, by flood just before 597/1200, at the zenith of Ghurid power, highlights the vulnerability of monumental architecture in this region.7 Although something of a consensus has emerged since the initial 1959 publication on Jam, accepting its identification with Firuzkuh, alternative sites have been sug gested; these include Taywara, much further to the south. Sourdel-Thomine registers the topographic limitations of the valley site (into which sunlight barely penetrates in winter) and the difficulties of access, which are such that it could not have supported an imperial capital in the sense that most modern scholars imagine (with an army of slave soldiers and mercenaries, an attendant state bureaucracy, and so on). It should be noted, however, that recent illegal excava tions on the hills surrounding the site have reportedly uncovered evidence for a great density of occupation in small, multistoried structures, recalling medieval accounts of Firuzkuh as heavily populated.8 Neverthe less, the author's interrogation of the con cept of a "capital" is well taken; the Persian historian Zakariya ibn Muhammad Qazwini (d. 682/1283), writing of Ghurid Firuzkuh (albeit after its destruction by the Mongols), describes it as a fortress (qalca) rather than a city.9 Not far from the minaret, the Hari Rud joins the Jam and Bedahan Rivers. Using aerial photographs, Sourdel-Thomine dem onstrates that these river valleys are cardi nally aligned, leading east-west and north south respectively. Leaving open the possibility that Jam is indeed the site of Firuzkuh, the author suggests that the site functioned as a kind of omphalos, a sym bolic center intimately connected to the rul ing Shansabanid family and Ghurid elite, rather than an imperial capital (pp. 45-51). There is nothing implausible in this sugges tion, especially in light of other indications of a taste for cosmological architecture on the part of the Ghurid maliks.10 In making a case for the elite associations of the site, the author might also have brought the ceramic evidence discussed ear lier in the same chapter (pp. 41-45) to bear on her argument. In particular, the retrieval of shards of luster and enameled (minai) pottery in 1960 and reported finds of both types of ceramics during recent ille gal excavations at the site are intelligible only in this light.11 Luster and minai were the luxury ceramics of the eastern Islamic world in the twelfth and thirteenth centu ries and were probably transported to the site from the central Iranian city of Kashan, the major production center at this date. The export of costly and fragile wares over such long distances and the retrieval of their remains (even in small numbers) from such a remote site is in itself indicative of a market for luxury goods. Some members of the Jewish community, whose presence in Jam is established by a series of tombstones (the majority dating from the period of the Ghurid sultanate), may have been interme diaries in this long-distance trade.12 Despite the emphasis in modern scholar ship on Firuzkuh, all the indications are that in fact Herat was much more important to the exercise of Ghurid imperium and artistic patronage than this remote moun tain stronghold. In the second half of the twelfth century, a major metalwork school was centered in the city, whose Friday Mosque was rebuilt in 597/1200, during a period when stylistic and epigraphic evi dence confirms the participation of its deni zens in Ghurid architectural projects as far away as the Indus Valley and the north In dian city of Ajmir. Although the Ghurids did not secure their control over Herat un til 571/1175, it was here that Ghiyath al-Din died and was buried. The Mongol historian cAla al-Din cAta Malik Juvayni (d. 1283) re fers to Herat as Ghiyath al-Din's ancestral power base and mentions embassies to the Ghurid court being sent to see the sultan in the city, making no such claims for Firuz kuh.13 While the assertion of an ancestral connection to Herat is erroneous, it is nonetheless revealing. In Chapter 2, the author moves from the topographic context to the form and struc ture of the minaret, which was constructed from fired brick, terra-cotta, wood, and stucco. The exterior elevation consists of three cylindrical shafts of decreasing thick ness from bottom to top, set on an octago nal socle and reaching a total height of over 255 feet (65 meters). The summit is crowned with a small (and remarkably well preserved) pavilion. The transition between different sections of cylindrical shaft was originally masked by projecting balconies borne on wooden armatures and a type of applied stucco revetment in the form of sta lactite, or muqarnas, vaulting. The summits of the two uppermost sections were deco rated with epigraphic bands framed with zones of floral and geometric brickwork; these were offset against the unadulterated brickwork of the lower parts of both sec tions. The lowest cylindrical section was the most lavishly decorated, with a wide tur quoise-glazed epigraphic band set between geometric medallions and palmette motifs. A series of brick panels covered the lower two-thirds of this section, their interiors filled with geometric patterns executed in relief. The outlines of these panels were formed by narrow epigraphic bands bearing the entire Chapter of Mary. To these basics, Sourdel-Thomine's study adds a wealth of closely observed detail that considerably enhances our knowledge of the minaret's structure and decoration. Among the new information is the fact that although the circular shaft of the minaret appears from the exterior to consist of three telescopic sections, structurally there are in fact only two. The interior is occu pied by two distinct staircases, both of which originated in a single entrance. The reason for this idiosyncratic element is unclear, and this is one of many that await further inves tigation. The discussion of the ornament in chap ters 2 (pp. 72-96) and 3 also provides a myriad of new details. The taxonomies of both the vegetal ornament used as framing ornament throughout the minaret and the geometric patterns that occupy the forty eight panels of the lower shaft are ex tremely useful and provide a range of data that will undoubtedly inspire future re search. Among the many interesting fea tures that the monograph brings to light is the occurrence of a flowering-vase motif in a band of vegetal ornament intervening be tween the two epigraphic friezes of the sec ond section (fig. 61, p. 115). Analogous flowering-vase motifs were integrated into the epigraphic frieze recovered from the palace of Mascud III (d. 1114) at Ghazna, and a vase or lamp is also among the few pictograms appearing on coins issued at Firuzkuh in the decade before 1170, which suggests that the motif may not be merely decorative.14 Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Sourdel-Thomine's study is her effort to map the relations between different aspects of the complex multidimensional ornamen tation of the minaret's lowest shaft. This analysis is presented graphically in figure 55 (reproduced here as Fig. 2). Most previous authors have been content to describe the overwhelming wealth of decorative details in general terms, but Sourdel-Thomine's care ful attention to detail enables her to detect an axial hierarchy in the decorative scheme.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS: FLOOD ON SOURDEL-THOMINE 539 She notes that all the inscriptions on the minaret terminate on its western face (face 8) and demonstrates that the eastern and western faces of the minaret (faces 4 and 8) constitute the axis around which the entire decorative program is articulated (p. 93). These are the densest and most lavishly adorned; eight-pointed stars are found only on these faces, for example. The eastern face is further distinguished by the presence of a knotted rhomboid pattern that is unique among the conjunction of epi graphic bands delineating the geometric panels of the minaret. Since the qibla was sometimes conventionally taken as west in Afghanistan and Central Asia (especially among adherents of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence), this is evidently the side of the minaret that one would have faced as one prayed toward Mekka. These welcome observations are not merely of general inter est: ultimately, such insights into both for mal and spatial relations make it possible to demonstrate the meaning of the epigraphic program, as we shall see below. Chapter 4 considers the inscriptions of the minaret, which are contained in five encircling bands. As the author notes in her pal?ographie analysis (pp. 104-12), one of the peculiarities of the minaret is its almost exclusive dependence on varieties of angu lar script at a time when cursive had been commonly used for monumental inscrip tions in the region for over a century. The sole use of cursive here is reserved for the architect's signature, providing a dramatic contrast with other early Ghurid monu ments, such as the Shah-i Mashhad madrasa (religious school) (571/1176) in Gharjistan and a tomb at nearby Chisht (562/1167), both of which combine cursive scripts such as naskKi with angular kufic. The two uppermost bands of the minaret contain religious texts, with the final inscrip tion appropriately chosen as the shahada, the Muslim profession of faith. Below this is an extract from Qur?an 61:13-14: "And [He will give you] what is dearest to you?help from God and early victory. So give good tidings to those who believe. O you who be lieve." The three lower bands are occupied by increasingly elaborate and bombastic ren ditions of the name and titles of Sultan Ghiyath al-Din. A concern with legibility re veals itself in their positioning and in the use of turquoise blue glaze for the letters of the central historical text. A similar desire to highlight the name and titles of a patron is witnessed in the placement, framing, and form of inscriptions on other twelfth-cen tury minarets, including that at Dawlatabad in northwestern Afghanistan (502/1108-9). The epigraphic ensemble culminates in an extraordinary but poorly preserved rendi tion of the sultan's titles surrounding the lowest portion of the minaret, its octagonal socle. The inscription demonstrates a stun ning calligraphic virtuosity, with the hastae n Q i rr i =" - 5 ?Tg 5 L&gt;yj ? 5 5 8 7 5 4 3 11 2 Minaret of Jam, schematic diagram of the epigraphic bands containing Surat Maryam (drawing by Claire Hardy-Gilbert, reproduced by permission of Janine Sourdel-Thomine ) (vertical elements) of ten-foot-high letters forming three alternating knot patterns at their centers and terminating in dense scrolls, each filled with a single palmette similar to those found in the brick friezes of the superstructure (fig. 49). In a terra-cotta panel integrated into the geometric ornament on the lowest shaft of the minaret (fig. 56, pp. 133-34), we find it described as the work of a micmar (archi tect) , one of the earliest recorded uses of this term on a medieval Islamic monument. The author's reading of the name, cAli ibn Ibrahim al-Nisaburi, suggests that he or his family hailed from the important eastern Iranian city of Nishapur. A Nishapuri archi tect was also apparently mentioned in the foundation text of an undated minaret at Sirwan near Herat, which has now disap peared. Although the author's attempt to link the two is unconvincing, Nishapur may well have supplied the Ghurid sultans with artisans skilled in a variety of media; the colophon of a superb Qur?an manuscript dated 584/1189 (the only manuscript that can be confidently ascribed to Ghurid pa tronage) bears the signature of a scribe with a Nishapuri nisba (toponymie).15 A series of geometric and vegetal medallions on the Jam minaret recalls similar features on con temporary metalwork and manuscript illu mination from the eastern Islamic world, one of many indications of a link between contemporary architecture and decoration in other media, including perhaps textiles. The final historical text on the minaret is the dating inscription (pp. 135-39). This appears above a rectangular panel of geo metric brickwork on the north face (face 2), directly above the octagonal socle, where it is believed that an entrance once existed. Ironically, in view of the uncertainty sur rounding it, its placement suggests a desire for legibility. The inscription is now consid erably elevated, and combined with prob lems of access to the site, this has led to a dependence on photographs for its reading. Compounding the problem is the fact that in the absence of diacritical marks (which were often omitted in medieval inscrip tions), the words for "seventy" (sabln) and "ninety" (tis^tn) in Arabic are virtually indis tinguishable. Ralph Pinder-Wilson has ar gued for a reading of 590/1193-94, and this date has been cited in most literature on the minaret. Using the photographic mate rial garnered in 1960, however, Sourdel Thomine reads the inscription as bi-ta??kh sana sabcln wa khamsamfa (on the date of the year five hundred and seventy [1174-75 CE] ) rather than tisc~in wa khamsamfa (five hundred and ninety). Since so much de pends on the author's reading, and since the date is one of many great unknowns that the present monograph is intended to resolve, the lack of a good photographic detail of the inscription is to be regretted; it took this reviewer a magnifying glass and a considerable amount of time poring over figure 36 before he was convinced of the author's reading.16 The titles used on the minaret, its decora tive style, and the use of turquoise-glazed elements have all been cited in support of the later dating. None of these holds up to close scrutiny, however. In the inscriptions</page><page sequence="5">540 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 3 of the minaret, the Ghurid sultan is re ferred to as Ghiyath al-Din, the laqab (hon orific title) that he acquired sometime after his accession to the sultanate in 558/1163. Drawing on numismatic evidence (p. 138), Sourdel-Thomine deftly dismisses assertions that the title was gained only after the cap ture of Lahore in 582/1186. To the single gold dinar formerly in the Kabul Museum (and presumably now lost) that the author cites, one might add a silver dirham minted at Firuzkuh that employs the title "sultan" and the laqab "Ghiyath al-Din" and bears the name of the cAbbasid caliph al-Mustan jid (r. 555-66/1160-70) or his successor al-MustadP (r. 566-75/1170-79).17 The style and treatment of the epigraphy is also consistent with a reading of 570/ 1174-75. The longest inscription on the minaret, the entire QurDanic Chapter of Mary, is deployed as a narrow band one and a half feet (fifty centimeters) wide that cir cumscribes the geometric panels on the low est shaft of the minaret and intersects itself at various points (pp. 139-53, Fig. 2 here); an epigraphic panel of identical form is found in the Ghurid madrasa at Shah-i Mashhad (571/1176).18 The extraordinary knotted inscription of the octagonal socle employs a tripartite division into baseline, median knot, and foliated terminal that is found earlier in the inscriptions of the Qasimabad minaret (ca. 1125-50) and in the inscriptions of the Shah-i Mashhad ma drasa. The foliate terminals of the socle in scription differ from those of Shah-i Mash had, their tight, single palmettes harking back to Ghaznavid or Seljuq prototypes ex emplified by the inscriptions of the madrasa atKhargird (470/1077). Similarly, the restrictive use of turquoise glaze to highlight the titles of the sultan on the first cylindrical section of the minaret does not of itself indicate a late date. Al though the only other dated Ghurid monu ment in which turquoise-glazed epigraphic elements appear is the Friday Mosque of Herat (597/1200), there is no shortage of earlier twelfth-century comparanda. The use of turquoise glazing to pick out the letters of an inscription is found on the Kalyan minaret of Bukhara as early as 520/1127. The foundation text of a minaret at Sin in central Iran dated 526/1132 is articulated in this way, as are the inscriptions on a series of minarets in the Isfahan Oasis and as far east as Tabas dated or datable between the 1150s and 1190s. The early use of the tech nique in the Jam minaret may be preco cious by comparison with the Friday Mosque of Herat, one of few Ghurid comparanda available, but viewed in the wider Iranian context, it is by no means implausible. In deed, the deployment of glaze in the service of legibility might be seen as part of a broader cultural phenomenon, witnessed by an exponential increase in the use of silver inlay to highlight script and decorative de tails in the metalwork industry that flour ished in Herat from at least the 1160s. Redated to 570/1174-75, the minaret is shorn of any Indian associations, since it antedates the first Ghurid incursions into the Punjab by at least a year. The author suggests that it commemorates the seizure of Ghazna from the Ghuzz Turks, who had occupied the city, in 569/1173. The practice of constructing minarets to commemorate military victories was known at the Ghaznavid court,19 and assuming that the date given in the foundation text reflects the commencement of work at the site, the presence of Qur?an 61:13-14, with its invo cation of victory given to the believers, might offer support for such a reading, es pecially since many of the Ghuzz were pa gans. Moreover, the capture of the former Ghaznavid capital had more than regional significance; it was a pivotal event for the development of the Ghurid sultanate. After the victory, Mucizz al-Din was installed as ruler of Ghazna and elevated to the rank of sultan, sharing in the sovereignty of his el der brother. Identifying the likely commem orative function of the minaret does not, however, resolve one of the central myster ies surrounding it: Why was it felt necessary to cover the surface of this remote structure with the entire Surat Maryam? Sheila Blair has noted that Ghurid pa tronage of religious monuments (mosques, minarets, madrasas) was "part of a coordi nated campaign to champion Islam . . . both to combat the heathen and to counter in ternal heresies."20 In his initial publication on the minaret, Wiet drew particular atten tion to the Ghurids' associations with a pop ular pietistic sect known as the Karramiya, a connection that Sourdel-Thomine revisits in her concluding remarks on the epigraphic program of the minaret (pp. 155-56). Born in Sistan, the eponymous Muhammad ibn Karram (d. 255/869) had preached in re mote regions of the eastern Islamic world such as Gharjistan and Ghur, where his preaching is said to have been instrumental in the conversion of the region to Islam.21 Although their disappearance in the wake of the Mongol invasions in the early thir teenth century has led scholars (especially those concerned with material culture) to overlook them, the Karramiya enjoyed a widespread popularity in the eastern Islamic world in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Karrami madrasas and khanqas (convents) were established in all the major cities of eastern Iran and Transoxiana, including Herat, Merv, Nishapur, and Samarkand. The sect competed for patronage, material resources, and spiritual adherents with rep resentatives of other legal and theological traditions, chief among them the Hanafi and Shafici madhhabs (law schools), two of the four orthodox Sunni schools of jurispru dence. Some evidence exists that the popu lace of Ghur combined Karrami theology with Hanafi legal precepts, but factional ri valry between these various sectarian tradi tions frequently led to civil strife and out breaks of violence in the cities of eastern Iran. When the Ghurid sultans finally broke with the sect in 595/1199, switching their allegiances to the two orthodox law schools, the feelings of the inhabitants of Ghur were sufficiently inflamed that riots broke out in Firuzkuh.22 Nonetheless, during their rise to power, the Ghurid sultans were closely affiliated with the Karramiya, reflecting the domi nance of the sect among the population of their mountain homeland. Their patronage of the sect extended to building mosques and madrasas for them, opening the possi bility that the minaret of Jam was indeed a Karrami monument. As the author acknowl edges, in the absence of detailed studies on the sect, she is dependent on conjecture and circumstantial evidence in presenting her hypothesis. There are, however, scat tered materials that provide an insight into Karrami beliefs. Using these to build on Sourdel-Thomine's careful reconstruction of the spatial relations of the epigraphic bands, it is, I believe, possible to demon strate the veracity of the author's intuition, while gleaning an insight into the ways in which monumental architecture and royal patronage were implicated in the vibrant and often fractious religious life of the re gion during its brief floruit in the twelfth century. In order to do so, we have to first broach the rather arcane world of medieval kal?m (speculative theology) and the issue of anthropomorphism in particular. Among the most theologically problem atic verses in the Qur?an are those that seem to imply the divine possession of cor poreal attributes, apparently contradicting or undermining the notion of an eternal and uncreated deity, which was central to Islamic thought. The opponents of the Kar ramiya depict the latter as taking a particu larly literalist or anthropomorphist ap proach to these questions, with the result that they were sometimes known as mujas sima, those who ascribe jism (body) to God. The nature of various divine attributes and qualities, among them divine speech, was aggressively contested by various sectarian groups in light of these anthropomorphiz ing verses. The issue was of some impor tance, central not only to the question of God's nature but also to the ontological sta tus of the Qur?an itself as the textualized trace of a speech act. At one extreme of the argument stood the Muctazalite opponents of the Karramiya, who asserted that the Qur?an consisted of words and sounds and was therefore not eternal but originated in space and time. At the other end of the spectrum were those scholars of the orthodox Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence who argued that the sounds, words, and even the material fabric</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS: FLOOD ON SOURDEL-THOMINE ^\ of the Quran were eternal and enduring. The Ashcari theological tradition, closely associated with the Shafici law school, sought to mediate between the two poles, distinguishing between the meaning of God's words, which constitute a kind of internal speech (kal?m nafsi) that is part of His di vine essence (and therefore eternal) and revealed commands, promises, and threats spoken by prophets, iterated in stories about them or transmitted in revealed books, all of which are created expressions of His eternal Word. The Karramiya also appear to have steered a middle course between extremes, judging from the account of their beliefs in the book of Muslim sects and divisions writ ten by Muhammad ibn cAbd al-Karim al Shahrastani (d. 1153), a resident of Khurasan who had firsthand experience of them: They hold that there are many incidents [haw?dith] in God's essence; such as, for example, information about past or fu ture events, the books revealed to the prophets (peace be upon them), stories, the Promise and the Threat, and com mands. In this category also are acts of hearing and seeing in regard to things audible and visible. Bringing into being and annihilation consist of God's Word and Will; for example, his saying "Be" [kun] to the thing that He wills to be and His willing the existence of that thing. His saying to a thing "Be" consists of two sounds. Muhammad b. al-Haysam [a Karrami theologian, d. ca. 1017] ex plained bringing into being and annihi lation as Will and Choice, this being con nected with His Word by the testimony of the Qur?an: "To anything which We have willed, We but say to it 'Be' and it is [kun fayakun]" [Qur?an 16:40]; or, again, "Verily, when He wills a thing, His command to it is 'Be,' and it is [kun fayakunT [Qur?an 36:82].23 In their attempt to distinguish between eter nal attributes and temporal acts, the Kar ramiya differentiated between attributes of essence (such as Power and Knowledge) and attributes of acts (such as creation).24 While God has eternal power to act, acts themselves are contingent and temporal in cidents (haw?dith) facilitated by His Power; every created thing and every temporal event is created and annihilated by the inci dents that arise in God's eternal essence. These are called into being not through Power, which is intrinsic to this essence, but through the divine command kun! (Be!) Like the words of the Qur?an, and those revealed in commands, promises, prophetic stories, and warnings, this imperative exists in time as a reflection of Power, which is eternal. As Shahrastani indicates, the Qur?anic phrase "kun fayak?n" (Be! And it is) occu pied a central position in Karrami polemics concerning the relation between divine nature and the created universe. The phrase occurs six times in the Qur?an, in cluding verse 35 of Surat Maryam.25 The positioning of this verse in the epigraphic program of the minaret offers striking sup port for the suggestion of a Karrami con nection. Sourdel-Thomine draws attention to the unique conjunction of the bands that bear the inscriptions of the minaret on its east ern face (face 4), where they form a single plaited rhomboidal knot, echoing the knot theme of the monumental inscription on the socle. The author notes the fact that "the most significant parts" of Surat Maryam, verses 35 to 41, begin within this central knot and continue in the pointed arch panel below, which is also unique among the various geometric panels that the epigraphic bands describe. It is precisely here, at what is clearly the visual and icono graphie fulcrum of the minaret (what Ro land Barthes might have identified as its punctum), that verse 35 falls. There is no statistical logic for this positioning. The verse is not the median point of the chapter but the thirty-fifth verse in a series of ninety eight; considerable care was thus taken to ensure that it fell precisely within the unique forms on the eastern facade. The verses that begin within the bands of the knot (Fig. 2, between I and J), then run down the lefthand frame of the arched panel below and the right side of the star beneath read as follows: This was Jesus, son of Mary: A true account they contend about [34]. It does not behoove God to have a son. Too immaculate is He! When He decrees a thing He has only to say: "Be," and it is [kun fayakun]. [35] The chapter then continues: [Jesus only said:] "Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path." [36] Yet the sectarians differed among them selves. Alas for the unbelievers when they see the Terrible Day! [37] The significance of these verses is said to lie in the fact that they "vigorously condemn the attitude of non-Muslim monotheists, Jews and Christians, invoking against them the witness of ancient prophets, chief among whom were Jesus and Abraham" (p. 154). This is obviously relevant to the cul tural context of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem (72/692), in whose interior verses 34 to 37 of sura 19 had appeared almost five centuries earlier. Here, the emphasis on the mortality of Jesus revisits a locus classicus of doctrinal difference between Islam and the Christian majority of the city. Yet there is little evidence for a Christian population in medieval Ghur, and it seems unlikely that the entire epigraphic program of the Jam minaret was designed to address the tiny community of Jews known to have existed in the vicinity of Jam. Such a literalist reading assumes an immutability and transparency of meaning belied by the existence of a rich exegetical tradition and by the ability of Qur?anic scripture to acquire particular va lences related to the contexts in which it was deployed.26 Rather than an address to some nebulous monotheist or polytheist "other," the central epigraphic program of the minaret should be understood instead as a bold address to the fractious monotheist "self." At the heart of the decorative scheme, in the focal in scription of the minaret, we have a distilla tion of the themes of prophecy, revelation, promise, and warning central to Karrami belief. The same themes are reiterated at regular intervals throughout Surat Maryam, which invokes a dazzling array of ancestors and prophets, including Aaron, Adam, Abraham, Idris (Ezra), Isaac, Ismacil, Jacob, John, Jesus, Moses, Noah, and Zachariah. Indeed, it is hard to think of another Qur?anic chapter in which such a multitude of prophets appear. The theme of the Book is also repeatedly emphasized, often in con junction with the commemoration of these saintly figures, and dire warnings are visited on those who deny the unity of God or dis believe in Him. The care taken to position verse 35 is the clincher, for it evidently reflects the central ity of the Qur?anic phrase kun fayak?n in kal?m concerning the complex relation be tween Divine Will and Word, Power and cre ation. The linkage between the person of Jesus and the creative power of the divine command kun! throws these issues into high relief, since the Virgin Birth (in which Mus lims believe) offers one of the ultimate proofs of God's ability to call into being with His command. The highlighted verses also reject Christian belief in Jesus' divinity (which contradicts the notion of tawKid, the oneness of God, central to Islamic thought), recalling contemporary criticisms that the sect's anthropomorphist views came close to those of Christianity.27 The Qur?anic com mentary of Abu Bakr cAtiq b. Muhammad al-Surabadi (d. ca. 1101), a Karrami of Nishapur, links the phrase "kun fayak?n" in Qur?an 19:35 with the creative power of God, while emphasizing that the verse con tains a rebuttal to those who assert that Jesus was His son. Surabadi's Qur?anic com mentary is an especially important docu ment, since its inclusion in a unique Qur?an manuscript commissioned by Sultan Ghiyath al-Din in 584/1189 (perhaps for one of the Karrami madrasas that he endowed)</page><page sequence="7">542 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 3 demonstrates its use in Ghurid religious circles.28 Considered within the frame of Karrami theology (or at least what we know of it), Qur?an 19:34-35 addresses the relation be tween God's eternal essence and His tempo ral creative powers, while underlining that the latter did not extend to the production of divine progeny. If the choice of Surat Maryam reveals the entire program of the minaret as a doctrinal exposition of Karrami theology, the focal verse highlights the issue of anthropomorphism and establishes its appropriate limits. These questions were central to the polemical exchanges between the Karramiya and their opponents, which were routinely conducted within the rhetori cal frame of infidelity (kufr) and heresy (tabdi?). Assuming (as seems likely) that the verses were chosen because they reflected contemporary concerns, the polytheists and unbelievers referred to in verse 37 are far more likely to refer to the Ghuzz Turks who had just been evicted from Ghazna, or to the Muslim opponents of the Karramiya, who depicted them in turn as spreaders of sedition, rather than the distant Hindus, with whom the Ghurid sultanate had yet to engage militarily. As this digression suggests, the great strength of Janine Sourdel-Thomine's achievement in this fascinating and wel come monograph is to demonstrate that aside from representing an architectural and aesthetic tour de force, the minaret of Jam reveals a remarkably sophisticated inte gration of architectural form, decorative elaboration, and epigraphic content. By do ing so, the author opens a unique window on the complex relation between architec tural patronage, dynastic aspirations, legal proscriptions, and theological disputations in the turbulent but vibrant marches of the eastern Islamic world. As Sourdel-Thomine notes (pp. 154, 160), the construction of the minaret was not a heuristic enterprise but one that reflects a great deal of plan ning and probably active collaboration be tween artisan, theologian, and patron. Moreover, the orchestration of the epi graphic program so that a key verse both describes and coincides with the nodal point of the decorative program hints at an early use of paper notation, documented only from the thirteenth century onward.29 The revelation that the preeminent archi tectural monument of the Ghurid sultans constituted a Karrami document hidden in plain sight opens the possibility that other known Ghurid monuments may also have been constructed for the sect. An obvious candidate is the richly decorated but frag mentary Shah-i Mashhad madrasa in Ghar jistan, an area associated with the biography of the sect's founder, built for a female pa tron (perhaps the daughter of Sultan Ghiyath al-Din or her mother-in-law) in 571/1175-76. To judge from the axial ori entation of the Jam minaret, the Karramiya, like their contemporaries in the orthodox Hanafi school of jurisprudence, adopted a conventional western qibla in their mosques and madrasas. That common ground should exist between the two on such a fundamen tal matter is perhaps not surprising, in view of reports that the citizenry of Ghur ad hered to Karrami doctrines in matters of theology and Hanafi precepts in matters of law.30 The fragmentary state of the Shah-i Mashhad madrasa makes its qibla orientation difficult to determine, but suggestions that it was occidented leave open the possibility that it was among the madrasas constructed for the sect by the Ghurid elite.51 Finally, the connection between the Jam minaret and the Karramiya offers further support for a date of 570 rather than 590. Assuming that the foundation text dates the start of construction, a reading of 590/ 1193-94 would see the Ghurid sultans em barking on a monumental assertion of pi etistic doctrines that they were to abandon in favor of more orthodox positions just five years later, in 595/1199. Robert Hillen brand has noted that the proliferation of script on Ghurid monuments constitutes them as "huge billboards proclaiming vari ous messages at those who enter them";32 in a similar vein, Sourdel-Thomine sees the minaret of Jam as "a permanent signboard" (p. 160). However deliberate the choice and positioning of the "signs," the need for modern photographic technology to deci pher many of them suggests that their effec tiveness as discursive statements was some what circumscribed by their scale and placement. This may have had its advan tages: one can only imagine the response of the Ghurid sultans to their own legacy after 1199, when their mountain fastness was dominated by a 255-foot-high assertion of the Karrami doctrines that they had just re nounced.

Everything rests on the question of whether or not the hasta of the initial letter of the dis puted word extends horizontally leftward at its terminal point, as Pinder-Wilson suggests in his text and accompanying drawing, "Ghaznavid and Gh?rid Minarets," 169, figs. 22-24. This would identify it as the Arabic letter t?? rather than the first of the three</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS: HERBERT ON ATHANASSOGLOU-KALLMYER AND WERTH 543 hastae of the letter sin. Sourdel-Thomine ar gues that Pinder-Wilson has been misled by the decay of the horizontal brick frame above the inscription, which was presumably more intact in 1960. The three initial strokes of the disputed word decrease in height as one reads from right to left; careful examination of the three vertical strokes of the letter sin in the preceding word sana shows the same char acteristic (although not as pronounced), sup porting a reading of sin rather than ta. One might also mention the inevitable vagaries of the photographic medium on which both scholars depend: the raking light in Pinder Wilson's figure 24 produces quite a different impression of the inscription than that given in Sourdel-Thomine's figure 36, which was evidently taken at a different time of day. 17.
