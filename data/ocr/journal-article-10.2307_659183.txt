<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ANCIENT MEGALITH IN JALAPA, VERA CRUZ BY J. WALTER FEWKES On my visit to Mexico in 1905 I saw in the court-yard of the Preparatory School at Jalapa an ancient sculptured stone of more than passing interest. I learned that this stone was presented to the school by Sr Teodoro Dehesa, Governor of Vera Cruz, and it is said to have been found near Tuxpan in that state.2 Through the kindness of the Governor I obtained the photograph reproduced in the accompanying plate xxix. I did not make an exact measurement of this megalith, but the bas-relief figures on it are little less than four feet. It is made of soft, light gray stone, and is nearly rectangular in shape, but slightly broader at one end than at the other; it was evidently once buried in the ground about one-third its length. The edges and top are straight and smooth. The general shape of the megalith and the figures thereon suggest that it was one of a series of upright stones standing in row, like those on each end of the stairway of the "palace" at Palenque. The stone sculpturing on one face is an excellent specimen of the artistic work of the eastern or coast peo- ples of aboriginal Mexico. In some, perhaps in most, particulars, the technique is Aztec, but in others more Huaxtec or Maya. I am acquainted with two published figures of the Jalapa mega- lith. One of those is given by Mrs Nuttall in her interesting article, " A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans," in which she points out that the human figure so conspicuous upon its face probably represents a priest making the sacrifice of drawing blood from his tongue by piercing it with a sharpened stick. In the same paper (p. 4) Mrs Nuttall refers to the megalith in question as follows: According to Sahagun the priests fasted during the four days preceding this festival and at noon blew conch-shells, flutes, and whistles, and then passed 1 This visit was made possible by an allotment of funds by the Smithsonian Institution. 2 According to Sefior Leopoldo Batres it was found at Quilozintla, Vera Cruz. 3 Archaological and Ethnological Papers of the Peabody Museum, I, no. 7, fig.

An interesting bas-relief pre- served at Jalapa illustrates this painful rite, the most graphic description of which is given by Friar Mendieta in his Historia Ecclesiastica Indiana (cap. xvII). A second figure of the megalith, taken from the same photo- graphic negative as the one here reproduced, was published by Sefior Leopoldo Batres in I905.' The manuscript of the present paper had been sent to the printer and the plate that accompanies it printed before I knew of Sefior Batres' article. In his brief description of the megalith, called by him the " Estela de Quilo- zintla," Sefior Batres identifies the human figure as the god Ehecatl, and the reptile as Quetzalcoatl, the latter so placed as to receive the blood from the tongue of the former in a penitential rite. Quotations from several older writers given by Mrs Nuttall leave no doubt of the validity of her interpretation of the action of the priest figured on the stone under consideration. It is more espe- cially the object of this article to discuss and interpret these sym- bols of the man and the animal with a view to the identification of the supernatural being to which they refer. The sculptor has cut in bas-relief on the surface of this stone two figures, one of which represents a human, the other a reptilian, being. It would appear from the almost identical symbolism on the heads of these two figures that one represents an anthropo- morphic and the other a zoomorphic personation of the same con- ception - a supernatural being. In other words, the one, a priest, is making an offering to the other-a god personated by the reptile. The figure of the priest appears to be standing on the body and tail of the symbolic animal which raises its head to his breast. Close comparison of the cephalic symbolism of these two figures reveals a suggestive similarity of the bonnet of the priest to the head of the reptile - a resemblance indicating that the figures are closely re- lated. The natural interpretation of this relation is that the priest personates the same supernatural being as that symbolically rep- resented by the reptile. The main part of the bonnet, exclusive of feather adjuncts, resembles the upper part of the head of the reptile near by. We detect a curved snout, which recalls the long nose of certain Mayan figures, a circular eye, and the line of the upper jaw at 1La Lipida Arqueoldgica de Tepatlaxco-Orizaba, Mexico, 1905.</page><page sequence="4">FEWKES] AN ANCIENT MEGALITH IN JALAPA 635 one end of which (that corresponding to the angle of the jaw) is a tooth curving backward. A similar curved tooth is repeated at the end of what appears to be a second parallel lip, in which the place for teeth is occupied by a row of circles, each with a central dot. An unusual appendage occupies the position on the rear of the head- dress near which one would naturally expect to find the ear. This is an incomplete circular disk with notched margin, from which hangs a curved body commonly represented in idols from the Vera Cruz region. The structure and significance of this will appear later in comparative studies of the same structure in the reptilian figure. The association of a reptile and a priest wearing a bonnet with reptilian symbolism recalls figures of men and serpents in some of the Mayan codices. For instance, we find several leaves of the Codex Cortesianus given up to a series of pictures of serpents accompanied by men wearing helmet masks with a symbolism almost identical with the heads of the sutrrounding reptiles. These men are identi- fied by Dr Schellhas as belonging to the group designated by him God B.1 It is probable that they represent priests personating the same god that is represented zoomorphically by the accompanying serpent. Precisely in the same way the human figure on the Tux- pan megalith may represent a priest personating the same super- natural being as the adjacent reptilian monster. Brief mention of certain common symbolic features in the two figures may be made before we consider their identification. The human figure naturally claims our attention first. Its left side is shown in the relief and the right leg is extended somewhat in ad- vance of the left as if the person were walking. The most striking object connected with this figure is the sharpened stick grasped in the hands and drawn through the tongue. As before stated, the attitude of the figure is that of a priest drawing blood from his tongue, while the reptile before him evidently represents symbolic- ally the being to which he is sacrificing. The priest is destitute of 1 The majority of the figures in both Aztec and Mayan codices represent not gods, but priests personating supernatural beings. The artist who made them drew masked men he had seen in ceremonial dances, just as the Hopi make paintings of men in ceremonial paraphernalia personating their kachinas.</page><page sequence="5">636 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGISY [N. S., 8, 19o6 clothing with the exception of a breech-cloth, the ends of which hang from the belt in front. There are sandals on the feet, and between the legs a small mammal1 and two circles which are cut in low relief. This is an Aztec figure and may refer to the date of the manufacture of the megalith or of the building of some pueblo in the neighborhood. Above the head and before the face of the priest there is a row of circles bounded by raised bands similar to the ornamentation on the body of the reptile. This series of circles ends abruptly in the upper right-hand corner of the megalith, as if it were formerly con- tinued on an adjoining stone when in situ. There is likewise a series of faintly incised figures on the surface of the megalith between the row of circles just referred to and its edge. It would be instructive to find out whether this stone once stood in line with others, forming a series on the face of each of which were sculptured a priest and an accompanying reptile. If so, the resemblance to figures in the Codex Coitesianus would be even more striking. The main characteristic of the human figure, the one which reveals the identity of his symbolism with that of the accompanying reptile, is an elaborate ceremonial bonnet with pendant feathers and other adjuncts. This object is tied to the head by a strap or band passing under the chin. From this bonnet a "trailer" made of feathers bound together extends down the back of the priest almost to his feet. To the top of the bonnet is attached, at the middle, a pointed object placed horizontally. This extends into two feathers fastened to the blunt or rear end. The perspective of the bundle of feathers called the trailer of the bonnet is more or less faulty, a rear view being shown instead of a side view as would be more natural when seen laterally. This may be a good point at which to say something concerning the decorations on the legs and arms of the priest. It is not clear to me whether these ornamentations should be regarded as body painting or tattooing, but they are probably intended for one or the other rather than for clothing. The designs represented are not especially noteworthy, but it is interesting to observe that circular 1Sefior Batres suggests that the animal is an ocelot.</page><page sequence="6">FEWKES] AN ANCIENT MEGALITH IN JALAPA 637 figures and dots appear at the joints and elbow, and that these are repeated at the waist, knees, and ankles as well as at the wrists. In other words, wherever there are joints, circles are represented. This may be a symbolic way of depicting the articulations at these places, in which event the circles may be regarded as parallel with the fig- ures of eyes found in similar positions in drawings made by the North- west Coast Indians. As the figure of the animal is represented with a leg, it is evi- dently a lizard-like being rather than a serpent. This leg rises from the center of a disk notched at the periphery, like that on the bonnet of the priest, but relatively smaller. It takes the place of the curved body that hangs down at the side of the neck in the case of the bonnet. The leg is provided with curved claws which grasp an unknown body. The head and mouth of this animal are especially reptilian. The lower jaw curves outward and downward and is armed with rows of rectangular teeth. A tongue projects beyond the mouth opening. The upper jaw likewise has teeth rectangular in profile and curving upward. At its extremity it is armed with a single tooth project- ing outward. There is a curved appendage, probably dental, ex- tending backward at the angle of the jaw, recalling a structure in the same position in the bonnet worn by the priest. The body of the reptile is serpentine, with the surface marked by a row of circles and curved bodies on the margin, representing curled ends of feath- ers. The body terminates in a circle from which extend parallel lines representing feathers. Below the horizontal part of the serpent's body there are several thorns similar to those in the hands of figures of priests in some of the codices, performing the penitential rite. The significant association of the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures on this megalith recalls that of certain drawings ascribed to the "God B" and the serpent in the Codex Cortesianus. This parallelism is emphasized by an examination and comparison of a structure in the mouth, common to both. I refer to the "tooth " at the angle of the jaw. This backward-pointing organ is one of the distinguishing characters of the mask and cephaloglyph of the "God B " in the codices, especially in the Cortesianus-Troano. It</page><page sequence="7">638 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 8, 1906 is found also in the serpent figures that accompany the " God B " in these codices. In the figures of both priest and reptile on the Tuxpan megalith a similar backward-curving object occurs in the angle of the jaw; the possession of this organ increases my belief that the figure in bas-relief on the stone corresponds to that called in the codices the " God B." If this identification is reliable, several interesting questions suggest themselves. There is little doubt that the megalith was carved by Totonac or Huaxtec sculptors, and its technique shows marked affiliation with work of the Maya, who were linguis- tically allied to those peoples. It has little in common with Aztec work, so pronounced in the Teayo ruin, except in the animal figure between the feet. The similarity of the figures in bas-relief to some of those representing the " God B" of the Codex Cortesia- nus-Troano would seem to indicate that this codex is Totonac or Huaxtec. There is considerable resemblance also between the figure of the reptile cut on the face of the megalith and certain reptiles in the Codex Nuttall. Seler' has brought together those to which I refer, and others of similar form, and concludes that they represent Xiuh- coatl, the Fire Snake. This would lead us of course to regard the figure of the megalith as Aztec rather than as Huaxtec. I am in- clined to believe that the reptilian monster on the megalith repre- sents a sky god allied to Quetzalcoatl and that the human figure represents a priest of that god. One objection to the identification of the human figure as a priest of Xiucutli, or Xiuhcoatl, is the form of the gorget or ornament suspended from the neck and hanging on the breast. The megalith figure bears what is apparently the cross-section of a conch-shell, the recognized symbol of the God of Air, Quetzalcoatl. The figures identified by Dr Seler as Xiucu- tli have on the breast in place of this gorget another of rectangular form with terraced extensions at each corner. While the head of the reptile on the same stone closely resembles figures of Xiuhcoatl, the Fire Serpent of Seler, the bonnet of the priest is more like known 1 Das Pulquegefdss der Bilimek'schen Sammlung. Gesammelte Abhandl., Bd. II, p. 937.</page><page sequence="8">FEWKES] AN ANCIENT MEGALITH IN JALAPA 639 figures of the head of Quetzalcoatl. It may be that this fact and the possibility that both reptile and priest personate the same god have some importance in showing the identity of Quetzalcoatl and Xiuhcoatl or that Xiuhcoatl is but another attributal name of the former god. I fail to find the characteristic symbolism of Ehecatl in this serpent figure. In briefly summing up the results of my studies of this mega- lith, I find that the two figures on it are connected, one represent- ing a priest performing a rite of blood-letting from the tongue, the other a zoomorphic personation of a supernatural being. Both represent the same god. The similarity of the bonnet of the priest and the head of the serpent to those of the priest with the helmet of the " God B " and the serpentine personation of the same, together with their association in both cases, shows some connection or implies that the human figure on the Tuxpan megalith represents a priest personating Schellhas' " God B," generally called Quetzalcoatl.
