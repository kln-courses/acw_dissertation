<plain_text><page sequence="1">GROWING WINGS. By Sarita Van Vleck. Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc., Garden City, N.Y. viii + 128 p. 1963. $3.95. According to the jacket of this book, its subtitle is "The Perennial Cycle of Birds," an appropriate description of the contents. The book is an attempt to present facts of nature to the layman. Miss Van Vleck describes the bird's year by carrying the reader from early spring migration through courtship, nesting activities, and raising the young, to fall migration and winter flocking again. Many of the author's line drawings illustrate various aspects of bird behavior, and her examples are taken from many species of birds, the most frequent one being the Redwinged Blackbird. In some ways this book is reminiscent of 'Wallace Grange's Those of the Forest, since the latter dealt with the annual cycle of a hare. No doubt this book will have its greatest appeal to those who have a meager knowledge of birds, and in this sense it will perform a great service. In writing this type of book any author would be compelled to oversimplify and generalize, perhaps with undue caution to possible exceptions. A great many of the generalities in Growing Wings would cause ornithologists to raise questions. Here are some samples: ". . . mating, [is] a relationship . . . unknown to promiscuous species"; "The strongest sperm meets the egg at the oviduct's top"; "Altricial birds hatch in twelve days as half-formed birds . . .[whereas] Precocial birds hatch after a month . . "; ". .. thus carrying out nature's design to eliminate those who are different from the majority"; "Common Crows [are] . . . able to eat almost anything eatable." In addition to these and other unfortunate sentences, there are numerous typographical errors, dependent clauses used as complete sentences, and occasional sentences wherein words were evidently (accidentally?) omitted. Perhaps the most apparent feature of the book is the author's extreme anthropomorphic expressions, many of these being quite humorous. The chapter on mating will serve to illustrate this point. Herein, a "maiden Robin felt it was time to wander next door"; "geese have shattered the fidelity image by divorcing and remating with someone else"; male Boat- tailed Grackles are likened to "sailors passing through ports"; and, as a cli- max, "A pair of English Sparrows made hay while the sun was shining by copulating fourteen times in succession .. ." Somewhat later, however, Miss Van Vleck states that "The physiology of avian copulation is simpler than</page><page sequence="2">512 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 70(2) that of the mammal...." On this point, the reader, but not this reviewer, may draw his own conclusions. The final chapter on "Winter" is the best written and most "meaty." In the last few pages the author's abilities in writing and expression reach their peaks as she touches briefly on some contemporary problems of bird conservation. The declining numbers of Bald Eagles are used to illustrate man's radical change of the environment and its consequences. A plea is made that man shall not be like the hunter who, after slaying a migrant bird, comes to appreciate its beauty only through its passing.-DAVID W.
