<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FEELING OF EFFORT. Dr. William James, Assistant Professor of Physiology in Harvard University, has recently contributed to the Anniversary Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, 1880, a dissertation, bearing the above title, from which we extract in the meantime the following summary of "Conclusions" :-- "(1). Muscular effort, properly so called, and mental effort, properly so called, must be distinguished. What is commonly known as 'muscular exertion,' is a compound of the two. - (2). The only feelings and ideas connected with muscular motion are feelings and ideas of it as effected. Muscular effort proper is a sum of feelings in afferent nerve tracts, resulting from motion being effected. (3). The pretended feeling of efferent innervation does not exist--the evidence for it drawn from paralysis of single eye muscles vanishing when we take the position of the sound eye into account. (4). The philosophers who have located the human sense of force and spontaneity in the nexus between the volition and the muscular contraction, making it thus join the inner and the outer worlds, have gone astray. (5). The point of application of the volitional effort always lies within the inner world, being an idea or representation of afferent sensations of some sort. - From its intrinsic nature or from the presence of other ideas, this representation may spontaneously tend to lapse from vivid and stable consciousness. Mental effort may then accompany its maintenance. That (being once maintained) it should, by the connexion between its cerebral seat and other bodily parts, give rise to movements in the so-called volun- tary muscles, or in glands, vessels, and viscera, is a subsidiary and secondary matter, with which the psychic effort has nothing immediately to do. (6). Attention, belief, affirmation, and motor volition, are thus four names for an identical process, incidental to the conflict of ideas alone, the survival of one in spite of the opposition of others. (7). The surviving idea is invested with a sense of reality which cannot at present be further analysed. (8). The question whether, when its survival invo1ves the feeling of effort, this feeling is determined in advance or absolutely ambiguous and matter of chance as far as all the other data are concerned, is the real question of the freedom of the will, and explains the strange intimateness of the feeling of effort to our personality. (9). To single out the sense of muscular resistance as the 'force sense,' which alone can make us acquainted with the reality of an outward world, is an error. We cognise outer reality by every sense. The muscular makes us aware of its hardness and pressure, just as other afferent senses make us aware of its other qualities. If they are too anthropomorphic to be true so is it also. (10). The ideational nerve tracts alone are the seat of the feeling of mental effort. It involves no discharge downward into tracts connecting them with lower executive centres; though such discharge may follow upon the completion of the nerve processes to which the effort corresponds."</page></plain_text>
