<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICAN ARTISTS IN AMERICA The African-American Institute, New York September 20, 1977-January 14, 1978 When one hears that "African art is dead," one must realize that there has been a striking omission in that often repeated statement. It should instead be, "The traditional art of Af- rica is dead." Even then, there must be seri- ous doubt about listing the death of so seminal an art, whose impact is found in abundance in the art of the Western world. Anyone who visited the exhibition of African artists in America at the African-American Institute 84</page><page sequence="2">may recall Mark Twain's remark that the re- ports of his death had been "greatly exagger- ated." Guest curator Tritobia H. Benjamin as- sembled works of twenty artists from nine African nations who, at the moment, reside in the United States. Their media included oils, bronze, pastels, graphics, wood, textiles and mixed media. This extensive creative effort invited serious attention. The exhibition co- ordinator, Jane Wilder Jacqz, was ably as- sisted by designer Jacqueline Springwater. This exhibition of contemporary African art reflected several motifs found in the tradi- tional subjects of early African artists. A painting by Chief Oloruntoba entitled The Secret Pot of Medicine evoked the work of the Oshogbo artist Twins Seven Seven. Both Kwabena Adum Ampafo-Anti and Paul Ofori-Ansah of Ghana displayed accept- able craftsmanship, although one could not find a truly new idea beyond the fantasy- burdened images of Amos Tutuola' s writings. There is an incipient danger here of reflecting subjects without genuine originality even in treatment. The world of fantasy offers a strong appeal to contemporary African art- ists, who seem to have no limits in depicting colorful anthropomorphic characters and meticulous details in line, color and form. The tall, majestic figure of A Fulani Woman sculpted by Felix Eboigbe of Nigeria expressed a dynamism that recalled the statues of Vincent Akwete Kofi of Ghana. Louis Mwaniki of Kenya, observing simplifi- cation of form and of means, produced an original series of sculptures in The Family. Interestingly, he deftly suggested the nail fetish motif of traditional Congo sculpture in his work. The several sculptures of Amir I.M. Nour from Sudan were outstanding. There was a sense of balance and textural perfection in his work, especially observable in Dolls and in Hanging Gourds. One felt a sense of satisfaction in the vari- ety of material in the show. There was still the thrust toward neo-traditionalism-the effort to capture mystery as if it were the sole pro- vince of the African artist. There was fond- ness for riotous color, apparently preferred by some West African artists. Mohammad Omar Khalil of Sudan, unlike Skunder of Ethiopia, portrayed the atmosphere of restraint that has often marked East African artists. There was variety and promise in this exhibition, as well as the slight, inescapable fear that the atelier experience of the African artist in America may adulterate his African- ness; he finds himself caught between traditionalism on the one hand and neo- traditionalism on the other. The way out only the artist himself can devise, but he must find it within himself and it will demand consum- mate skill. We should be mindful of the fact that the stream of aesthetic excellence which flows toward the greater cultural development of mankind flows on because of man's genius which unites creativity with skill.
