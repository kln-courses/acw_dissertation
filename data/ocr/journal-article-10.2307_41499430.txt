Fifteen 4-year-olds and fifteen 5-year-olds from a public kinder- garten in northern Taiwan participated in this study. The children were interviewed before and after an instructional intervention to examine their understandings about how the weight, volume, and material of an object are related to sinking and floating. During the intervention, children manipulated objects made of different materials and were assigned to one of the three groups: scaffolding-material (provided with teaching scaffolding and allowed to see the materials of the objects), scaffolding (teaching scaffolding only), and material groups (seeing the materials only). In the first two groups, 16 teaching strategies based on six scaffolding principles were employed. Analyses of inter- views showed that before the intervention, the 4-year-olds seemed to have a variety of explanations for sinking and floating and a majority of the 5-year-olds used weight as an explanation for floatation. After the intervention, both 4- and 5-year-olds in the scaffolding-material and scaf- folding groups improved their understandings of floating and sinking. Particularly, three out of five 5-years-olds in the scaffolding-material group related the material of an object to its buoyancy and generalized their explanations to the objects made of the same material.

This study provides insight into how to support young children to learn science through effective teaching strategies. Keywords Early childhood • Science education • Scaffolding • Sinking and floating Introduction Preschoolers and kindergarteners have many opportunities to manipulate objects and observe the phenomena of float- ing and sinking of objects in their daily life. When doing these activities, they develop explanations of why an object floats or sinks. Previous research has shown that children's explanations are rooted in their perceptual experiences and different from scientific ones. For example, preschoolers use anthropomorphic reasons to explain buoyancy (e.g., Butts et al. 1993; Piaget 2001), and most 4- and 5-year-olds tend to believe that a single property of an object (e.g., weight, volume, material, or color) can cause it to sink or float (Tenenbaum et al. 2004). Is it possible to help preschoolers and kindergarteners understand the scientific concepts behind sinking and floating? To judge whether an object can float in the water, children need to compare the density of the object to the density of water; and density is defined as the ratio mass to volume. The concept of buoyancy may be too difficult for young children to understand because it requires them to coordinate multiple properties of an object including den- sity, mass, and volume. Thus, Piaget (2001) suggested that Springer</page><page sequence="2">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 657 children would not fully understand the concept until their late childhood (about age 9). Based on this suggestion, the design of a developmentally appropriate learning activity for young children should focus on manipulating objects rather than developing a scientific explanation of why an object floats or sinks. Other researchers, however, argued that young children already develop some ideas about density and buoyancy even though they cannot articulate their reasoning and explanations (Kohn 1993; Smith et al. 1985). Also, under adults' guidance or assistance, children could adjust their initial explanations and improve their understanding about the concept of buoyancy (e.g., Smith et al. 1985; Tenen- baum et al. 2004). In other words, young children's learning activities of floating and sinking can go beyond direct manipulative experiences with objects. Starting with young children's experiences and initial explanations, teachers could advance their scientific learning by employing effective instruction. Although previous studies have found that children's understandings about floating, sinking, and density grows after educational interventions (e.g., Butts et al. 1993; Tenenbaum et al. 2004), little is known about what teaching strategies contribute to the growth. Taking the notion of scaffolding that allows children "to participate at ever- increasing levels of competence" (Palincsar and Brown 1984, p. 122), this study focuses on the scaffolding strate- gies that help children bridge the gap between their initial ideas and the intended understandings about buoyancy. Thus, in this study we ask: (a) What are 4- and 5- year-olds' initial ideas about floating and sinking, respectively? (b) What scaffolding strategies can teachers use to promote young children's understandings of floating and sinking? and (c) What understandings do young children develop after teachers scaffold their learning? The findings of this study could shed light on effective teaching practices for supporting young children's development of scientific understandings. Young Children's Explanations for Buoyancy Researchers have investigated young children's early explanations of floating and sinking. One type of explana- tions for buoyancy is moral or anthropomorphic without mentioning any physical characteristic of an object. For instance, in Piaget (2001), 4-5-year-olds attributed buoy- ancy to moral necessity and believed that a boat remains afloat because that is something it must do. Examples of anthropomorphic reasons involve "personalities" of an object, such that a floating object is clever than a sinking one. A second type of explanations involves children's observa- tions about a property or a physical characteristic of an object. Children of 5 and 6 years old in Butts et al. ( 1 993) and Piaget (2001) started using hardiness, color, weight, mate- rial, or volume of an object for their explanations. Similarly, Tenenbaum et al. (2004) found that most kindergarteners used the material of an object (e.g., magnet sinks) or one property of an object (e.g., lighter things float) as explana- tions for floating and sinking. These properties or charac- teristics are usually perceptual and this type of explanations heavily relies on children's manipulative experiences. According to Piaget (2001), the two types of explanations indicate different developmental stages. Moral or anthro- pomorphic explanations are used in an early stage that ends at about age five, whereas the second type of explanations are usually generated by 5- and 6-year-olds. However, none of these explanations are scientifically accurate. Developing scientific explanations of buoyancy require coordination of two or more properties of an object. As mentioned previ- ously, the concept of buoyancy is associated with densities of a liquid and the object in the liquid; and density is defined as mass divided by volume. Children have to somewhat inte- grate the two properties, weight and volume, in order to explain floatation. Piaget (2001) suggested that children do not develop some understandings of density until age six to eight. However, Kohn (1993) found that although 4- and 5-year- olds may not be able to integrate two properties of an object, they already had some knowledge about density and its relationship to buoyancy. In her study, 4- and 5-year olds were asked to predict whether objects can sink or float in the water. These young children and adults showed similar patterns in their predictions. Both groups were more likely to make a correct judgment when the density of an object was much higher or lower than that of water. When the density of an object was close to water, both groups had difficulties to make accurate predictions. If preschoolers and kindergarteners already have some ideas about floata- tion and density, how can teachers build on their prior knowledge to help them learn more about buoyancy? Rather than introducing a formal definition of density, Smith et al. (1985) suggested using "material kind" to help children differentiate the concepts of weight and density. Children in their study were presented with a large alumi- num piece that had the same weight as a small steel piece, and they were required to answer questions of "Are there two objects made of the same kind of stuff or are they made of different kinds of stuff' (p. 211). The results showed that about half of the 4- and 5-year-olds and almost all the 6-9 year-olds could explain why one object is heavier than another with the same size by appealing to the different materials the two objects are made of. By directing their attention to the material, young children may be able to recognize the differences between density and weight, and to perceive the existence of a relation between weight and ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">658 J Sci Educ Technol (2011) 20:656-666 volume of an object. Drawing on the findings of Smith et al. (1985), this study designed interventions that guided young children to focus on what material an object was made of rather than teaching them the complex concept of density. In summary, before receiving formal instruction, pre- schoolers and kindergarteners have developed some ideas of sinking and floating that can be built on, expanded, and brought into science classrooms. However, little research has been done on what strategies teachers can use to interact with children's ideas in order to further their understandings about buoyancy. Taking the notion of scaffolding, this study examined the scaffolding strategies that can help children bridge the gap between their initial ideas and the intended understandings about buoyancy. Scaffolding Young Children's Scientific Learning Two teaching approaches have been taken when educators consider appropriate ways to promote young children's scientific understandings. One approach emphasizes the readiness to learn and tends to follow Piaget' s step- wise developmental stages to design appropriate instruction. The advocates believe that children are not ready to learn sci- entific concepts until they are mentally matured. As Metz (1995, 1997) argued, however, designing science education curricula for young children on the basis of this teaching approach may underestimate children's abilities to reason abstract and complex concepts. This approach also ignores the critical role of support and guidance by knowledgeable adults. On the other hand, another teaching approach is invoked by Vygotsky's notion of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) that is defined as the distance between a child's actual developmental level and his or her level of potential development under adult guidance (Vygotsky 1978). This approach focuses on how to design support and instruction in order to scaffold children's learning within the ZPD (e.g., Reiser 2004; Stone 1998; Wood et al. 1976). Scaffolding is a process in which knowledgeable adults provide decreasing amounts of guidance to support chil- dren to achieve higher cognitive goals that children cannot achieve independently (Fretz et al. 2002). Decisions on in what ways and how much guidance should be given rely on adults' knowledge about children's current developmental levels, the levels of their potential development, and the process of achieving upper developmental levels (Bredek- amp and Coppie 1997). What are preschoolers' and kindergarteners' current development levels? Developmental psychologists have found that young children have cognitive limits such as poorly-developed metacognition, limited ability to think aloud, and little domain-specific knowledge (Metz 1997; Vygotsky 1978). Additionally, their short- and long-term Springer memories are not fully developed (Bredekamp and Coppie 1997). All these cognitive limits influence young children's reasoning and learning of complicated scientific concepts. Therefore, support and guidance from knowledgeable adults is important in assisting children to develop deeper understandings about science. As Wood et al. (1976) sta- ted, "tutorial interactions are, in short, a crucial factor of infancy and childhood" (p. 89). Past research has found that when provided with appropriate scaffolding, young children could deepen their scientific understandings. For example, Butts et al. (1993) showed that 5- and 6-year-olds changed their concepts of floating and sinking when they were given opportunities to manipulate and discuss the rules of floating under adults' guidance. Additionally, in response to adults' higher-level cognitive questions, children in return gave higher-level cognitive answers (Butts et al. 1993). Tenenbaum et al. (2004) also revealed that after attending scaffolding pro- grams, kindergarteners increased their abilities in explain- ing floating and sinking and demonstrated deeper conceptual understandings. Other studies also demonstrate young children's improvements in science under adults' guidance. Heath and Heath (1982) investigated the effects of physical and verbal interventions on children's science learning. They found that when 3-6-year-olds in the experimental group were handed unfamiliar objects (physical intervention) and verbally invited to explore and interact with these objects (verbal intervention), these children spent more time on manipulating objects, con- ducted more high-level cognition activities, and engaged in more scientific activities that required their use of scientific materials. In addition, Hadzigeorgiou (2002) showed that provided 4-6-year-olds with structured learning activities and guidance, these children could develop understandings about the concept of mechanical stability and apply the concept they had learned to complete evaluation tasks. Although researchers have found that appropriate inter- vention activities or instruction could promote young chil- dren's scientific understandings, very few studies addressed specific teaching strategies that adults can use in scaffolding children's understandings of floating and sinking. Accord- ing to Wood et al. (1976), to assist a child to complete a difficult task, adults can provide scaffolding that fulfill one of the following tutoring functions: (a) initiating and maintaining the child's interests in a task, (b) decreasing the number of unnecessary movements in order to ensure a task is manageable for the child, (c) keeping the child in the right direction of achieving the task, (d) pointing out discrepan- cies between what the child do and what might be a correct solution, (e) controlling the child's frustration during a task, and (f) demonstrating solutions to a task. In recent years, researchers have revisited and reexam- ined the definition of scaffolding, which provide insight</page><page sequence="4">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 659 into how to develop scaffolding strategies that would be useful to meet the functions listed by Wood et al. (1976) and improve kindergarteners' scientific understandings. Stone (1998) suggested that during the scaffolding process, an adult gradually increases, then decreases assistances, and eventually transfers responsibility of completing a task to a child as he or she gradually masters a task. Also, Stone stressed that shared understandings of a task and effective communications between an adult and a child are essential elements of effective scaffolds. Additionally, Reiser (2004) expanded previous research and identified two mechanisms of scaffolding: structuring and problematizing a task. To structure a task, an adult decomposes a complicated task to a manageable order, decreases unnecessary options, and monitors a child's progress. During a process of proble- matizing a task, an adult encourages a child to express ideas, asks him or her to make decisions, and points out discrepancies in his or her thoughts or among peers' thoughts. Quintana et al. (2004) also suggested that helping children to articulate their thoughts and ideas is one of the key elements of scaffolding. Making one's thoughts visible would help children make sense of the task and manage the process of completing a task. Furthermore, after reviewing relevant research, Pea (2004) indicated that scaffolding involves modeling children how to complete a task, and channeling a child's attention toward relevant aspects of a task in order to maintain the direction of achieving a task. By reviewing the studies above, we identify six scaffolding principles that can guide us to design strategies to promote young children's scientific understandings: 1. Affective supports: controlling children's frustration and maintaining their interests. 2. Articulation: encouraging children to express their thoughts. 3. Focusing: guiding children to focus on relevant aspects of tasks. 4. Modeling: demonstrating solutions to a problem or completion of a task. 5. Problematizing: pointing out discrepancies in chil- dren's thoughts and providing cognitive conflicts to encourage children to think further. 6. Promoting shared understandings: providing children with guidance to facilitate understandings of tasks. Methods Participants Thirty children from a public kindergarten in northern Taiwan participated in the study. These children were from families of middle or low socioeconomic status. Fifteen of them were 4-year-olds (seven boys and eight girls) and 15 of them were 5-year-olds (eight boys and seven girls). The mean age of the 4-year-olds was 4 years and 8 months while the mean age of the 5-year-olds was 5 years and 9 months. This study involved three groups based on two key intervention components that influence children's under- standings of buoyancy: teacher scaffolding and children's perceiving of the objects' materials. The reason we chose the material kind of an object rather than its density as one of the components because the literature has suggested that material is a property that is easier for young children to directly perceive and can be used to explain buoyancy (e.g., Kohn 1993; Smith et al. 1985). To investigate the effects of these components on children's explanations, we assigned them into three groups: scaffolding-material ( S-M ), scaffolding (S), and material (M) groups. There were 10 children in each group (five 4-year-olds and five 5-year-olds). The first author, who had a master degree in early childhood education and 3 years teaching experience in kindergartens, played the role of tutor and interacted with children in the three groups. In the scaffolding- material group, the tutor employed scaffolding strategies to support children's learning process and allowed them to see the materials of the objects. In the scaffolding group, the tutor also used scaffolding strategies but the children did not know what the objects were made of because the objects were covered by colored tapes. Objects made of the same material were covered by the same colored tape. Therefore, by seeing the tape colors, children could iden- tify the objects that were made of the same material even though they did not know what the material really was. In the material group, the tutor did not provide any scaf- folding but children could see the materials of the objects. All three groups were allowed to manipulate objects. Procedures Pre-Interview The purpose of the pre-intervie ws was to explore children's initial explanations about floating and sinking before the intervention. The first author (the tutor) interviewed all children individually and all of the interviews were vid- eotaped. Each pre-intervie w lasted about 10 min. The tutor first asked a question to ensure that children knew what floating and sinking meant. She then provided children with three sets of experimental objects (Table 1) and asked children to predict buoyancy (or otherwise) of the objects and to explain why an object floated or sank. Children could touch the objects and feel the weights but were not allowed to place them into the basin filled with water. The tutor asked questions for elaboration if needed and did not give any feedback to children.

All intervention processes in the three groups were videotaped. Each intervention lasted about 30 min. For children in the scaffolding and scaffolding-material groups, the tutor started to interact with them individually, guided them to test the buoyancy of the objects used in the interviews, and employed scaffolding strategies to support their learning. Scaffolding was given through the tutor's verbal prompts, gestures, and demonstrations that led children to reach a higher level of understandings about buoyancy. Depending on children's initial status, a higher level could involve partial or full understandings of the relationship between material and buoyancy that objects made of the same material can all float or all sink. Take one strategy, providing opportunities for cognitive conflicts (Strategy 1 1 in Table 2), as an example. When children explained that an object sank because it was heavy, the tutor provided children with another object that was hea- vier but it floated in the water. In doing so, the tutor challenged children's ideas, created opportunities for cog- nitive conflicts, and forced them to reconsider and revise their initial explanations. Another example is the scaf- folding strategies that follow the focusing principle (Strategies (5)- (7) in Table 2). If children did not mention any of the three properties (i.e., volume, weight, and material) in their explanations, the tutor would ask ques- tions to direct children's attention on these properties: Which one is bigger? Which one is heavier and what happen to the heavier one in the water? Are they made of the same material? Examples of verbal prompts used by the tutor in the scaffolding and scaffolding-material groups are listed in Table 2. For children in the material group, after the pre-inter- views, they could start to play with the three sets of objects used in the pre-interviews. They could manipulate these objects on their own, use the scale provided by the tutor to measure the weights of the objects, place objects in the water, and observe whether objects can float in the water. The tutor answered questions raised by these children (such as how to use the scale) but did not provide any guidance to intervene children's manipulations of objects. Post-Interview The purpose of the post-interviews was to examine chil- dren's understandings about sinking and floating after the intervention. Similar to the settings in the pre-interviews, the post-interviews were videotaped and conducted by the tutor. Each post-interview lasted about 10 min. Because the three pre-sets of objects were used in pre-interviews and the interventions, we designed the other three sets of objects for the post-interviews (Table 1). Similar interview questions were used during the post-interviews; children were asked to judge whether an object in the sets will sink or float in the water and then to explain their answers. Children were not allowed to put experimental objects into the water, and the tutor did not give any feedback to children's predictions and explanations. Data Analysis Video recordings collected from the interviews and inter- vention processes were transcribed in verbatim. All tran- scripts were then imported into a database and organized by the NVivo analysis software (QSR International, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia).

We also revised codes that shared similar definitions, cat- egorized codes based on their characteristics, and removed codes that were not relevant to our research questions. The coding scheme was finalized after a repeated review of the data and included two parts: scaffolding strategies (Table 2) and children's explanations (Table 3). After the transcripts were coded, we counted the instances of children's explanations and scaffolding strat- egies used, identified the range of variation, and generated assertions about the possible connections between chil- dren's age, their explanations, interventions, and scaffold- ing strategies (Creswell 2007; Huberman and Miles 1994). These temporary assertions were then validated by con- firming evidence from the data. Findings To answer the research questions, this section first presents findings from the pre- and post-interviews to show the 4- and 5-year-olds' initial ideas about floating and sinking and their understandings after the intervention. Analyses of the intervention processes are then presented to reveal what and how scaffolding strategies were used by the tutor to children with different ages and in different intervention groups. Young Children's Understandings About Floating and Sinking Explanations Before Intervention During pre-interviews, the 4-year-olds generated 60 explanations about floating and sinking and their older counterparts provided a similar number of explanations (67 in Table 3). Before the intervention, the 4-year-olds' explanations for the buoyancy of an objects included weight (30.0%), volume (16.7%), irrelevant answers (15.0%), and don't know (11.7%) while the 5-year-olds' explanations included weight (56.7%), material (10.5%), volume (6.0%), and power of water or objects (6.0%) (Table 3). It appears that these children used weight as an explanation for buoyance more often than they used other factors as explanations. Particularly, among the 4- and 5-year-olds who considered weight as an important factor, a majority of them thought that an object sank because it was heavy. Additionally, the 4-year-olds' answers showed a large variation whereas more than half of the 5-year-olds' responses were related to the weight of an object. The 5-year-olds considered the weight of objects (47.8%) and the materials of objects (10.4%) as factors that affected an object to sink or float more often than the 4-years-olds did.

Explanations After Intervention After the intervention, the 4-year-olds in the scaffolding- material (4-S-M) and scaffolding (4-S) groups used weight and volume of objects more frequently to explain the buoyancy of objects than they did before the intervention (Table 3). As presented later, these explanations might be related to the tutor's frequent use of focusing strategies. Only one child in the 4-S-M group started relating the material of an object to its buoyancy. He concluded that "all things made of iron sank." In addition, the 4-year-olds in all three groups generated similar numbers of instances (5 in the 4-S group; 6 in the 4-S-M and 4-M groups) of other explanations (e.g., irrelevant, don't know). These findings suggest that constructing understandings about the real- tionship between material and buoyancy was very difficulty for the 4-year-olds. In terms of 4-year-olds in the material group, they showed a wide range of responses, and the pattern of their responses was similar to that of the 4-year- olds' responses before intervention. Therefore, manipula- tive experiences might not be enough for children to further their understandings about floatation. Although approximately half of the 5-year-olds' expla- nations in the scaffolding-material (5-S-M) group still included weight as an important factor (Table 3), four instances of explanations produced by three children in the 5-S-M group showed their partial understandings about the relationship between material and buoyancy. In response to the tutor's questions in post-interviews, the three children explained that the object floated because "it was made of plastic" or the object sank because "it was soap." In addition, they could generalize their explanations to the Springer</page><page sequence="8">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 663 objects made of the same material. The excerpt below shows an example and is from the post-interview of a 5-year-old boy, Hung. Tutor Why does this [plastic pad] float? Hung Because it is made of cotton, it floats Tutor It is made of plastic. Does all plastic stuff float? Hung (nod) As long as they are [made of] plastic, [they] all float Tutor (pointing at a piece of soap) Do you know what this is? Hung Soap. Soap will sink Tutor All soap sinks? Hung Yes Tutor If I cut it (the soap) to a smaller size? Hung [It] should also sink Tutor If I make it a bigger piece of soap? Hung It will definitely sink It seems that during the post-interviews, some 5-year- olds in the S-M group generated their explanations on the basis of their daily experiences and formalized their experiences into a simple rule such that things made of soap will sink. Their experiences with plastic and soap allowed them to identify "material" as a factor that causes floatation. Furthermore, some of them no long used volume or weight as part of their explanations. Similar to the 5-S-M group, most of the 5-year-olds in the S group who could not see the materials of the objects still believed that an object sank because it was heavy. Although scaffolding was provided, no explanation generated in this group related the material of an object to its buoyancy. This finding suggests that scaffolding alone might not promote children's understandings of this difficult concept. The 5-year-olds in the material group were allowed to see the materials of the objects and to play with objects on their own. The analyses of post-interviews revealed that without the tutor's scaffolding and guidance, children in this group seemed distracted by properties of the objects and features of the surroundings. Their explanations included weight, vol- ume, as well as other object properties (e.g., color and har- diness). Compared with the 5-S and 5-S-M groups, the material group provided a variety of answers and demon- strated a pattern similar to the 4-year-olds in pre-interviews. Furthermore, some of them identified the materials of the objects but none of them used the material as part of their explanations. This finding suggests that without an adult's scaffolding, 5-year-olds may not be able to focus on crucial features of a phenomenon and make meaningful explanations. Scaffolding Strategies Used The analyses of the intervention processes showed that 16 scaffolding strategies based on the six scaffolding principles were employed (Table 4). The most frequently used strategies were: ask for explanations (103 instances for 4-year-olds and 99 instances for 5-years-olds) and ask for predictions (80 instances for 4-year-olds and 75 instances for 5-years-olds). Because children in the study usually provided short answers and did not spontaneously elaborate their answers, these two strategies were used to encourage children to articulate their explanations and predictions. Other frequently enacted strategies were to promote shared understandings of the tasks; the tutor used prompts, questions, and gestures to help children carry out experiments, make comparisons, and remind children of their previous ideas (Table 4). Table 4 also shows that the total number of the instances of scaffolding strategies for the 4-year-olds (462) were slightly higher than the total number for the 5-year-olds (448). This may be because, compared to the 5-year-olds, the 4-years-olds were more likely to misinterpret the tutor's questions and guidance. Analyses showed that some 4-year-olds kept talking or doing things that were not rel- evant to the tasks and some ignored the tutor's prompts and guidance. The scaffolding strategies used among different inter- vention groups were also examined. Table 4 shows that the 4-S-M group received the most instances of scaffolding strategies. During the intervention, the 4-year-olds in this group hesitated to explain and changed their explanations frequently. Thus, the tutor asked them more questions in order to probe their ideas. In addition, the tutor provided more opportunities for cognitive conflicts in the 4-S-M group than in other groups. Since the five children in this group were more likely to have a hard time generalizing their thoughts, the tutor provided more examples and sit- uations that guided them to think beyond their original explanations. Furthermore, analyses of the intervention revealed that children in 4-S-M group needed more guidance on recog- nizing the crucial features of a phenomenon. Table 4 indicates that the 4-S-M group received an average of 3.4 instances of "focusing" compared to 1.6 instances for the 5-S-M group. Particularly, the tutor led children in the 4-S- M group to focus on the weight of objects. They also received more instances of "encourage children to make comparisons." Having more instances of focusing and making comparisons may be because these children had a wider range of initial explanations about buoyancy and the tutor needed to make more effort to direct children's attention to important properties of the objects. Analyses of the interactions between the tutor and the 4-year-olds suggested that some scaffolding strategies seemed not appropriate for them and could not help them achieve a higher level of understandings. This may be because the cognitive level required by the task was far â Springer</page><page sequence="9">664 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 Table 4 Instances of scaffolding strategies for 4- and 5-year-olds in different groups Scaffolding strategies 4- Year-olds 5- Year-olds S-M S Total S-M S Total Affective supports Control frustration 2 0 2 2 2 4 Maintain interests 3 1 4 2 0 2 Articulation Ask for explanations 63 40 103 49 50 99 Ask for predictions 41 39 80 40 35 75 Focusing On material 4 4 8 3 4 7 On volume 3 2 5 2 4 6 On weight 10 4 14 3 2 5 Modeling Correct errors and provide information 15 7 22 10 9 19 Demonstrate how to use tools 4 6 10 7 6 13 Problematizing Point out discrepancies 10 8 18 11 13 24 Provide opportunities for cognitive conflicts 18 12 30 13 15 28 Promoting shared understandings Ask for hands-on experiments 22 25 47 22 21 43 Ask sorting questions 24 12 36 25 17 42 Encourage comparisons 22 15 37 13 20 33 Encourage the use of tools 8 6 14 8 8 16 Remind previous ideas 18 14 32 18 14 32 Total 267 195 462 228 220 448 S-M scaffolding-material group, S scaffolding group, M material group beyond these 4-year-olďs current or potential levels. For example, two of the five 4-year-olds in the S-M group were not provided with the opportunities for cognitive conflicts. The analyses showed that these two children either could not provide any explanation or gave answers that were irrelevant to the tutor's questions. Without an explanation or a description of their ideas, the tutor encountered diffi- culty providing counterexamples to create cognitive con- flicts because they did not express an idea to be challenged. For these two children, the tutor employed more strategies of modeling in order to demonstrate the completion of the task. Table 4 also shows that the 4-year-olds in the scaf- folding group received the least scaffolding. It appeared to be difficult scaffolding children's learning about buoyancy when the objects were covered by color tapes. Because the information about what the objects are made of was asso- ciated with children's perception and previous experiences, without this information, children could not use their per- ception and experiences as learning resources and the tutor could only guide them to focus on an object's weight and volume. Therefore, in response to a question of whether the objects are made of the same material, the 4-S group tended to answer "no" or "I don't know." This suggests that children's perceiving of the objects' materials was critical for learning as well as teaching the concept of buoyancy. When children could see the materials of objects (i.e., 4-S-M and 5-S-M groups), the tutor could easily focus their attention on the materials of objects by asking "What are they made of?" or "Do the objects made of the same material float (or sink)?" Children then would observe and manipulate objects in the water basin to answer the tutor's questions. After that, they may combine their previous experiences with the manipulative activities to generate explanations for buoyancy. Discussion and Conclusions In this study, we found that before the intervention, the 4-year-olds seemed to have a variety of explanations for sinking and floating and a majority of the 5-year-olds used weight as an explanation for floatation. After the interven- tion, both 4- and 5-year-olds in the scaffolding-material and scaffolding groups showed improvements in explaining and understanding of floating and sinking. The 4-year-olds in Springer</page><page sequence="10">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 665 these two groups focused more on using the weight and volume of an object as explanations. Particularly, three out of five 5-years-olds in the scaffolding-material group devel- oped understandings about the relationship between an object's material and its buoyancy. Additionally, compared with the 5-year-olds, 4-year-olds needed more scaffolding when learning a complex concept of buoyancy. Some scaf- folding strategies were not effective to some of the 4-year- olds; this is probably because the task required a higher developmental level of understandings that was not achiev- able for them. Finally, combining scaffolding with children's perceiving of the materials of objects is a more effective way to support children's learning about sinking and floating. Piaget (2001) stated that the most explanations of buoy- ancy generated by 4-5-year-olds are moral and anthropo- morphic. However, in this study, we found that only one tenth of the explanations could be classified as moral and anthropomorphic. Almost half of the 4-year-olds' explana- tions were related to the weight and volume of objects. This finding suggests that 4-year-olds have started to notice the physical characteristics of objects when asked to explain why an object floats. Compared with the children in Piaget' s study, the 4-year-olds in this study demonstrated more sophisticated understandings about floating and sinking before the intervention. In terms of 5-year-olds' initial understandings of buoy- ancy, previous studies argued that children tended to use only one property of an object as explanations for floatation (i.e., Butts et al. 1993; Tenenbaum et al. 2004) but these studies did not provide quantitative data to show which property is dominant in their explanations. This study showed that most of the 5-year-olds viewed the weight of an object as a dominant factor that causes an object to sink or float. The findings of children's initial explanations extend the literature and deepen the understandings of young children's conceptions about floating and sinking. These findings could also help educators develop and employ scaffolding strategies to support young children achieving upper developmental levels (e.g., Fretz et al. 2002; Reiser 2004; Stone 1998; Wood et al. 1976). Additionally, this study sheds light on young children's various improvements in the understanding of floating and sinking after receiving scaffolding. We found that after the intervention, 4-year-olds tended to use weight and volume of objects as explanations for buoyancy whereas some 5-year- olds were able to use the materials of objects to explain buoyancy. These findings reveal children's potential devel- opmental levels about the understandings of buoyancy. On the basis of these findings, educators can thus set appropriate goals for children with different ideas of buoyancy when designing early science curricula. We found in this study that when supported by appropriate scaffolding, young children improve their understandings of floating and sinking. This finding is consistent with previous studies, which argued that appro- priate instructional supports optimize children's scientific understandings (i.e., Butts et al. 1993; Hadzigeorgiou 2002; Tenenbaum et al. 2004). Although past research discussed the benefits of using scaffolding strategies, very little research has investigated what specific strategies can be used to promote scientific understandings of young children with different developmental levels. To fill this research gap, we identified and examined 16 scaffolding strategies based on six principles. Furthermore, this study reveals that not all scaffolding strategies were helpful for every young child. Scaffolding strategies that are appropriate for some children are not effective for others. We conclude that teachers should employ different scaffolding strategies for children with different initial levels of understandings. Our findings also align with Wood et al. (1976), who found that younger children need more instructional sup- ports from adults to complete a difficult task. The 4-year- olds in this study received more instances of teaching scaffolding than the 5-year-olds did. The reason that 4-year- olds needed more scaffolding was because they frequently changed their thoughts, had hard time generalizing their thoughts, and ignored the tutor's guidance. These cognitive limits are also evidenced in previous research (e.g., Piaget 2001; Wood et al. 1976). Piaget (2001) indicated that younger children change their explanations frequently. Also, Wood et al. (1976) found that young children are more likely not to pay attention to adults' guidance. Based on the understandings of younger children's cognitive limits, we suggest that educators need to provide younger children with more scaffolding to help them achieve a higher cognitive goal. In Butts et al. (1993), the strategies used by the teachers were mainly questioning. Also, the manipulative experi- ences were not differentiated in their study. To extend their study, we employed more scaffolding strategies and inclu- ded two types of children's perceptual experiences: touch- ing and seeing. We found that both perceptual experiences were important to children because without perceiving the materials of objects they were not able to draw on their previous experiences. Additionally, the findings of the 5-year-old material group suggest that scaffolding is also crucial for children to learn the concept of buoyancy. In other words, to the 5-year-olds, the perceiving of materials and the tutor's use of scaffolding strategies were synergistic in which the effect of children's perception depended on the tutor's enactment of scaffolding strategies. Without either one of these, the 5-year-olds did not demonstrate improve- ment in their understandings. We therefore suggest that when helping young children learn the concept of floatation, a tutor can encourage children to perceive the materials of objects as well as provide them with scaffolding strategies. Springer</page><page sequence="11">666 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:656-666 Also, a tutor can provide children with objects made of materials with which children are familiar. Providing familiar objects would help children use their previous experiences with these objects as their learning resources to comprehend why an object floats or sinks. This study suggests that teachers could guide kinder- garteners to focus on the materials of objects and use this property to explain floatation. However, will it cause children difficulty drawing a connection between floatation and density as they start learning these concepts? Because children at these young ages may not be able to generate an explanation on the basis of two properties of an object, this study showed that the idea of "material" would be devel- opmental^ appropriate for kindergarteners to comprehend. Additionally, compared to using volume or weight to explain buoyancy, associating "material" with concepts of density and floatation is more scientifically appropriate. However, this association should be temporary; when children achieve a higher developmental level and are able to comprehend the relation of weight and volume of an object, teachers should teach children the concept of den- sity and use it to explain buoyancy. This study was subject to some limitations. First, each child in the intervention groups only received a one-time intervention. Receiving an intervention more times may reinforce children's understandings of floating and sinking. Second, the children were not familiar with the tutor. Children may be less comfortable with completing a diffi- cult task under a stranger's guidance. On the other hand, it is often more difficult for a tutor to lead young children to achieve a difficult task when the tutor has not built a trust- worthy relationship with children. Without such a relation- ship, a tutor may not be able to control children's frustration effectively and give them enough emotional supports to complete a task. Third, only one type of learning activity was provided in the study, which was a hands-on activity. Integrating hands-on activities with other learning activities such as reading, drawing, visiting a water museum, and playing games may improve young children's understand- ings of buoyancy better. Further studies could employ the intervention more times and investigate children's improvements in under- standing of the concept of floating and sinking after the intervention. Moreover, researchers can incorporate more learning activities and tools into an intervention to help children learn the concept of floating and sinking. Com- parisons of children's improvements after receiving an intervention more times or receiving an intervention of multiple learning activities and tools will help researchers find out the key factors of an effective intervention. Lastly, future research could investigate how the teaching strate- gies in this study help young children in understanding other scientific concepts. In doing so, researchers will gain a more comprehensive picture of appropriate teaching scaffolding for young children.
