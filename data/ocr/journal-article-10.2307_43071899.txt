Evaluating Science Boohs For Children Why should elementary science teachers become in- volved in the process of selecting good science and mathematics books for school and public libraries and in advising parents as to the books they should pur- chase for their children? The reasons are self-evident in a cursory review of what is happening in the revi- sions of the educational process. Many concerned individuals and organized groups have been engaged for the past decade in assessing the traditional teaching methods and curricula in sci- ence and mathematics, and in bringing them up to date. Realizing that all responsible members of a literate society need a cultural background in the sciences and mathematics, whatever their trade or profession, some universities and colleges long have offered cultural courses in the sciences for nonscience majors. Such cultural courses usually rely heavily on collateral read- ing in standard works consisting of biographies, essays, treatises, histories, anthologies, and current reports of working scientists. The newer elementary and secondary courses in the sciences and mathematics being developed through the collaboration of working scientists, college faculty members, and elementary and secondary school teach- ers are based on the same fundamental objective: Science, including mathematics, is a part of all life and culture. Therefore, fundamental scientific literacy must be part of the sum total of knowledge of every person. In other words, the basic science courses in elementary and secondary schools are for all students - not merely for those who have vocational goals in science and technology. The objectives of the recent approaches to science education place emphasis on the broad, dynamic principles, laws, and processes which often lead to no final answers, but contribute segments of a gradually developing body of knowledge. Science, then, is a continuous expansion of an incomplete body of knowledge. The AAAS Commission on Science Education, for example, in its new elementary science curriculum for grades 1 to 6, now being tested and evaluated, takes a multidisciplinary approach with the objectives of teach- ing the following elements: recognizing space-time rela- tions; recognizing number relations; observing; classi- fying; measuring; communicating; inferring; predicting. Groundwork is being laid for the all-important task of education - teaching a student to do his own thinking. Modern science and mathematics curricula neces- sarily must rely heavily on collateral reading as well as involve the student in meaningful individual science experiences. Such reading provides breadth and depth to the knowledge obtained from the textbook and labo- ratory exercises. It enables the reader to understand more clearly broad applications, implications, and future possibilities for the skills and techniques he has learned. Since "science is the servant of man," accord- ing to I. Bernard Cohen, the reader can understand best how it has served in the past, how it is serving in the present, and how it may serve in the future through collateral reading and thinking. An analysis of elementary school library collec- tions as well as children's departments in public libraries indicates a deficiency in science and mathe- matics books (averaging 10.2 percent in school libraries in contrast to the recommended 25 percent). Too many of the science books are out of date and poorly chosen. Frequently, budgets for the purchase of new books are unrealistic or not available. The traveling libraries administered by the AAAS from 1959 through 1964 demonstrated that children will read liberally and voluntarily if they are presented with interesting and challenging material, and many of them have an appetite for books marked by publishers NOVEMBER 1965 9</page><page sequence="2">as suitable for older age groups. Initially and upon receipt of the traveling collections, many librarians wrote that the books were "too hard" for most of the children and that they needed easier books. They were requested to wait and observe the reactions of their young readers. Many responded a second time indi- cating that their first appraisals of the books in relation to the reading ability of the students were in error, for "all the books are out." As children, and many of their teachers, became acquainted with authentic and inspir- ing books for the first time, there was growing interest and improvement in reading on the part of the "reluc- tant" and "slow" readers. Reading appropriate books stimulated interest in individual science projects. Good collections of science and mathematics books are indispensable in all school, college, public, and home libraries. Reading for students should be chosen as "occupational reading." Reading is the occupation of students and they are paid for their work in terms of knowledge, ability to think, and increasing personal skills. Selection of science books, either for the home library or for school or public libraries, should be based on the same standards. Books for children and young adults, however, are difficult for the layman to evaluate. The following gen- eral suggestions, based on criteria used in the evaluation of books for The A A AS Science Book List for Children and the new AAAS publication, Science Books: A Quarterly Review , may be helpful: Authorship- Who is the author? Do his education and experi- ence qualify him to write a book on this subject? Subject and Content- Is the subject one of fundamental interest and im- portance to the prospective reader? Is the subject handled in sufficient depth so that it will constitute a worthwhile learning experience for the reader? Is the organization logical in sequence of ideas and details? If the book answers the fundamental questions of "how" and "why" using appropriate technical terms, it probably is a worthwhile purchase. If it is a super- ficial survey covering too broad a scope, perhaps it should be avoided. Illustrations - If the photographs and drawings are accurate, are accompanied by adequate explanatory legends, and are directly keyed to the text, they serve a useful purpose. Mere embellishments that add nothing to the text, but add to the cost of the book, are seldom worthwhile. Vocabulary- Most young children converse freely and intelligently with adults, acquire a broad vocabulary through radio and television, and hence can and should read any words that are the best choice for expressing scientific ideas and concepts. "Controlled vocabularies" for chil- dren's books are totally unnecessary, and are being discarded by many authors who formerly adhered to them. With pronunciation markings, and definitions either in the text or in a glossary, a reader of any age can understand and learn to use correct technical terms. Biographies- Science biographies for children and young people should be written as contributions to the history of science and therefore stress the biographee's discov- eries, contributions, and professional attainments and associations. A fictionalized biography that relies heavily on manufactured conversation and relates non- essential personal details may be interesting reading, but has no value in science education. Nature Study Versus Science- Animal tales and folklore have their important place in children's literature, particularly for preschoolers. When they begin school, children deserve more sub- stantial fare - no talking animals, no anthropomorph- isms, no "Dick and Jane" reading matter. Superficial nature study ("look and see") never was very exciting to most children. The same material taught in terms of biological science (Who? How? Why?) is interest- ing and enables students to "get involved." Buy genuine biology books for children in preference to superficially descriptive and sentimentally written "nature books." Look for books that give complete life histories or ecological studies. Physical Science and Technology- Merely descriptive books about rockets, missiles, air- planes, atomic reactors will entertain but are not edu- cationally worthwhile unless they introduce the reader to fundamental scientific laws and principles - and to the painstaking underlying research and experimenta- tion. Such books should demonstrate to the reader how and why his science and mathematics courses are basic preparation for those who want to be scientists, technologists, doctors, engineers, and space travelers. Experiment Books- "Doing things" and "making things" are essential activities for all children. If "experiment books" are designed to demonstrate scientific facts and principles, encourage the reader to do additional experimentation on his own initiative, and stress the value of additional background reading, they are good purchases. Reaching Upward and Outward- In selecting reading for children and young people, it is well to buy books that they will have to "grow into" - books that hold their interest but require re- peated reading and study to understand and enjoy thor- oughly. Books should be chosen not only to deepen the reader's major fields of interest, but to acquaint him with other, unfamiliar areas of knowledge. High school 10 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="3">students report frequently that their good scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests have been made possible by their varied and liberal voluntary reading habits that date back to grade school days. Career choices are made, frequently, on the basis of background acquired through collateral reading which has expanded the read- ers' knowledge to fields not explored completely in the classroom lesson. The application of the foregoing selection criteria results in the rejection of many so-called children's science books produced by free-lance writers who lack sound scientific training or who handle facts carelessly. Professional science writers, scientists, and science edu- cators are the best-qualified authors of good science books. The new elementary science curricula that are being prepared and evaluated will begin to emerge as commercially published teacher's manuals within a year or so. There is an urgent immediate need for the writing and publication of children's books produced in the same spirit and dynamic concepts of the curricu- lum materials. It is hoped that more people with good scientific backgrounds will study the new curriculum materials and put their imagination and ingenuity to work in the production of children's science books that are needed for collateral and recreational reading by children. The market for children's science books has been greatly increased through the financial assistance available through the National Defense Education Act and the Library Services Act. Other legislation pro- viding federal aid to education, when enactment and implementation are completed, will further magnify the potential market.</page></plain_text>
