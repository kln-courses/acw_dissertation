In Klänge Altamerikas: Musikinstrumente in Kunst und Kult [Sounds of the Ancient Americas: Musical Instruments in Arts and Cult] the distinguished ethnomusicologist and music-archae- ologist Ellen Hickmann presents the large Freudenberg collection of pre-Hispanic musical instruments and sound tools, currently housed in the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen in Mannheim, Germany. In the richly illustrated book Hickmann describes and discusses about 300 sound artifacts pertaining to various South American, Central American and Mesoamerican cultures roughly dating between c. 1500 B.C. and A.D. 1500. Written in a clear language, the detailed and beautiful designed book gives an impression of the richness of pre-Hispanic music cul- tures. Readers will discover a wealth of little known or even unknown information regarding many aspects of sound and music making in the prehistoric Americas. Without doubt, Klänge Altamerikas has to be placed at the top of the list of music-archaeological research handbooks on pre-Hispanic soundscapes. As in the case of her previous book, Musik aus dem Altertum der Neuen Welt [Music in the Antiquity of the New World] (Hickmann 1990)], the English and Spanish editions are indispensable. In terms of cultural and organological diversity, and state of preservation, the Freudenberg collection of pre-Hispanic musical instruments is of exceptional quality. Most of the objects, including not only ceramic musical instruments, but instruments made from metal, shell, bone, plant fiber, and other materials, are in perfect, even playable condition. On the basis of certified thermoluminescence (TL) data, all of the objects are roughly dated and their au- thenticity proved. Just a few cases of falsification were detected (pp. 21-22). The significance of the collection is demonstrated by the fact that musical instruments of important cultural core areas, namely the Moche and Chimú valleys of Peru, and the Maya area, the Gulf Coast and West Mexico of Mesoamerica, are part of the largest collection of such objects brought together in one place outside of their countries of origin. Therefore, Klänge Altamerikas is of interest for a wide audience, and it is to the credit of the combined work of Dieter and Eva- maria Freudenberg, Ellen Hickmann, and the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen, that the collection is publicized in its entirety. Instead of a cultural division as main criterion, Hickmann grouped the instruments ac- cording to organological and morphological features: (1) flutes and whistles, (2) sounding figurines, (3) whistling vessels, (4) horns and trumpets, (5) drums, (6) rattles, and (7) other sound tools, such as stone gongs and scrapers. Following a short introduction to the collec- tion the author outlines several important aspects discussed in the book, such as identifying pre-Hispanic sound artifacts and grouping them, the close relation of indigenous music and dance practices with religious concepts, the role of shamanism, the overall similarities in pro- duction and use of pre-Hispanic musical instruments between geographically and sometimes divergent cultures, and the possibilities of drawing conclusions on the basis of ethnographic analogy. In the manner of a synthesis, some general thoughts on music, dance and song among pre-Hispanic cultures conclude the book. The division applied by the author reveals a current dilemma in music archaeological research, especially when discussing musical instruments of ancient cultures and cultural ar- eas, in which primarily archaeological and less often written information is present. Thus,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews • 145 one cannot be sure if a sound tool was used for music production, and it is even unclear if a concept of music comparable to contemporary western concept(s) existed at all. Likewise, the pre-Hispanic indigenous classifications of tools for sound and music making are little known, even if there are attempts to break this code on the basis of scattered information found in sixteenth-century written sources, music iconological information, and ethnographical infor- mation on contemporary ethnic groups in which living traditions are thought to be preserved. As yet no conclusion can be drawn and attempts must be considered speculative. A scientific way to avoid this dilemma is to divide the sound artifacts according to the classification system of musical instruments proposed by Hornbostel and Sachs (1914) and others. Ellen Hickmann follows this system in the most general sense, organizing the instru- ments in the following manner: (duct) flutes, i.e. aerophones in which the sound is generated by a stream of air channeled in a duct and directed to the edge of a windway; horns and trum- • pets, i.e. aerophones consisting of curved or straight tubes, in which the sound is generated by lip vibration; (skin) drums, i.e. membranophones consisting of a soundbox with a membrane, which is struck (the membranes are usually not preserved); rattles and other sound tools, i.e. idiophones in which the proper body of the instrument is set into vibration. Two individual chapters are dedicated to morphological subtypes, which are not classified as such by Horn- bostel and Sachs, namely Tönende Figurinen [sounding figurines] and Pfeifgefäße [whistling vases], the former globular flutes and whistles in zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and fitomor- phic shapes; the latter globular whistles, in which the incoming air is driven by a liquid inside of one or several prefixed recipient chambers brought in motion. From the point of organol- ogy, "sounding figurines" is a somewhat imprecise term, as figurines with rattle pallets could be labeled the same, but are placed in the category of idiophones. Additionally to these "flute figurines" or "rattle figurines" some cultures produced hybrid instruments composed of two distinct organological types, such as the "flute-rattle figurines", i.e. flutes in shape of a figu- rine with a rattle pallet located inside the resonator (p. 24). However, it is probable that from the point of view of the indigenous instrument maker these instruments formed categories, which often played an important role in domestic musical practice. Whistling vases, on the other hand, probably were used in funerary rites and concern concepts of the afterlife. As Hickmann correctly points out, many pre-Hispanic flute and whistle types are yet not fully classified in organological terms, the rich body so far undescribed and these unique instrument types widely neglected (p. 26). A glance at the Freudenberg collection reveals both the great variety in morphological and decorative forms of pre-Hispanic musical instruments and a great consistency of certain organological types, which were widely established in the so-called Formative or Pre-classic periods (according to the cultural area, about 1000 to 1500 years before 200 B.C. and A.D. 150) and then subsequently modified. Apparently, there was not a linear evolution, but co- evolutions of large traditions of considerable depth with repeated reunions during times of cultural contact and transition. Nevertheless, some circum- American aspects of pre-Hispanic music remained despite regional, temporal and cultural differences and probably can be traced back to a common substratum shared by all cultures. One such aspect is the close affiliation, if not congruence, of music and dance practices with religious concepts, including the idea that musical sound establishes communication between expert mediators and the spiritual world. Although the role of shamanism in pre-Hispanic musical practice and the many conceptual implications are still not well understood, a series of repeatedly occurring elements is present which can be related to shamanic practices. The information on the use of music as a powerful means in religious activities, including hallucinogenic intoxication utilized in curative rites</page><page sequence="3">146 • the world of music 51(1) - 2009 and spirit invocation of ancestors and numinous beings, is far too present to neglect (pp. 14- 16). Indeed, the world of pre-Hispanic musical instruments is full of mythological beings with fantastic features appearing to emit strange sounds, such as air noise, fluttering and buzzing sounds, edge tones, aural harmonics, beats and difference tones. As sound was so important in pre-Hispanic societies, one vital topic, acoustics, is left for future research of the Freudenberg collection. Thus, in Klänge Altamerikas the actual sound qualities of the preserved instruments are only generally described. A highly interesting study field, the experimental testing of playing techniques and acoustical possibilities of the work- ing specimens, still needs to be explored.
