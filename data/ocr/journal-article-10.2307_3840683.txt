Mosby's Place, Language, and Identity in Afro-Costa Rican Literature (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 2003), to show the continuity of Duncan's texts with the Afro-Caribbean literary tradition of the English-speaking West Indies, and the writerly practices and thematic concerns of modern Latin American fiction. University of Missouri, St. Louis LORNA V. WILLIAMS Daphne Patai and Will H. Corral, eds., Theory's Empire. An Anthology of Dissent. New York: Columbia UP, 2005. ix + 725 pp. The subtitle, "An Anthology of Dissent," captures accurately the substance and thrust of the essays collected in this hefty tome. An impressive number of philosophers, linguists, literary critics, and sociologists teaching and writ- ing in both Europe and the United States, register, over the course of thirty years, their objections to and disciplinary dismay with many of the tenets of what has been called theory, but especially deconstruction and pragmatism. Most of the arguments put forth have already been aired in journals, books, and conferences. What is new and important is to hear the multiple voices of dissent coming together and sounding loudly, now that theory, despite its many critics, has permeated work across the disciplines in the humanities. The anthology focuses on the negative effects of theory-mainly Derrida- on the study of literary history and the interpretation of texts as inherited from the first half of the twentieth century. In the first part, "Theory Rising," the key note is sounded by Rene Wellek's essay entitled "Destroying Literary Studies" originally published in 1983. The second part, perhaps the most interesting, features the polemics between Jacques Derrida and his critics on the question of the referent. "Literary Theory and its Discontents" by the philosopherJohn R. Searle (1994) maintains a certain freshness as it tackles three influential positions on textual meaning. Searle attempts to dismantle "Stanley Fish's claim that the meaning of a text is entirely in the reader's response; the claim made by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels that the meaning of a text is entirely a matter of the author's intention; and the view ofJacques Derrida that meaning of, well, what?" (147). Searle claims that these authors "make general remarks about the nature of language without making use of principles and distinctions that are commonly accepted in logic, linguistics and the philosophy of language" (147). For Searle the confusion entailed in the differences between Fish, Knapp Michaels and Derrida stems from a shared ignorance of the fact that in analytic philosophy "most concepts and distinctions are rough at the edges and do not have sharp boundaries [ .. ] and since 1953 we have to develop theories why the cannot. Indeed, in 481</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS addition to examination of the problem of vagueness, there have been quite extensive discussions of family resemblances, open texture, underdetermina- tion and indeterminacy" (147). "Empire Building" is the title of part three. Here the essay by the Brazilian philosopherJ. G. Merquior, "Theorrea and Kulturkritik" (1986) sets the tone for a series of harsh polemics with presentism, post-colonial criticism and Paul de Mann. Merquior opens his essay with a salvo against the post-modern read- ing of Nietzsche. He asserts that "it does not in the least follow that because our knowledge of the world presupposes interests and values the world itself is therefore but a product or projection of those values or interests" (234). Mequior particularly decries the subsequent sacking of mimesis based on the idea that what we call "correspondence to reality rests on no more than shared language which imposes on things a conformist adjustment to unconscious or manipulated social meanings rather than grasping their real nature" (234). The trouble is, he adds, that "it does not follow from this premise that 'there is no mimesis"' (234). The fourth part, "Theory as a Profession," considers the effects of cultural studies on the professoriat and its role in determining the present star system. This subtitle follows in the wake of Geoffrey Galt Harpham's essay originally published in Profession: Conversations on the Future of Literary and Cultural Stud- ies (2002). Gait Harpham discusses the tensions between the star system and the proletarization of the professoriat in the American academy. He squarely blames the rise of theory for this regrettable situation. "How did the univer- sity [ ... ] come to germinate a whole class of overcompensated sybarites?" (382), he asks. The answer, he believes is counter intuitive but inescapable. "Theory, at least in the humanities, gave birth to the star system" (382). As the critic traces the institutionalization of theory, he presents a long list of particulars, chief among them is the capacity of theory to "materialize objects out of thins air" (383). This force is only comparable to the power theory acquired across institutional intra murals (385). "In everyday parlance, theory and power may be antonymous, but within the university, they rapidly became synonymous [ .. . ] the prestige of theory was remarkably concrete. Theorists, especially foreigners [ .. . ] possessed the power of decree" (393). The author issues here a call for the next generation of scholars to retrieve history from theory, and he outlines ten lines of attack for doing so (393). In proposing a concrete project that would correct and heal the damage that theory is sup- posed to have brought on to the university, this is one of the more valuable essays in the volume. Part five ranges over the post-modern recasting of identity. The introduction points to the glaring contradictions that drive the treatment of the production of identity. While all identities, like meaning itself, are unstable, no one can question the truth of the assertions made from identitarian positions (397). Kwame Anthony Appiah's nimble and bemused rendition of how moral judg- ments have entered literary theory remains quite pertinent. In "The Battle of the Bien-pensant" (2000) Appiah reflects on academic moralism, a phenom- 482</page><page sequence="3">MLN enon with a long tradition. Appiah examines the contexts and assumptions on which today's academic moralism sounds new and different (442). The rise of the "essentialist" charge is given much credit in dismantling the old "we" of Protestant academic moralism. Having made of "essentialist humanism" a term of opprobrium, it was now, ironically possible, to be labeled an essentialist for saying both that people were different and for saying that people were the same. As a case example Appiah analyses the story of how the work of Susan Gubar went from being regarded as ground breaking feminism to being none other than the repositioning of essentialist criticism. Appiah believes that a "quondam insurgent critic fell victim to a new insurgency" (445). But the question for Appiah is not the irony of the case. Rather he is interested in describing and understanding the "climate of moral inflammation" (446) that made it impossible for Gubar to respond to and criticize her critics without having her character impugned (446). Appiah concludes that the "intertwin- ing of academic and social agendas has given rise to an outlandish rhetorical inflation, a storming-of-the-Bastille bombast brought to bear on theoretical niceties. Individuals get taken for kinds" (446). This essay opens the door for the chief claims made in part six, "Theories as Surrogate Politics." With part seven the volume makes a turn in the road and begins to ad- dress a project of restoration, now that theory is said to have run its course. And yet, the critique of concepts such as social construction and epistemic violence continues in controversial and important essays by Noam Chomsky and Meera Nanda, respectively. Nanda's essay is particularly interesting because it documents the bizarre twists that Gayatri Spivak's intervention in subaltern studies can take. The volume comes to a close with part eight, "Still Reading After All These Theories ...." Perhaps the strongest articles in the group are the texts authored by Marjorie Perloff and Wayne C. Booth. In "Crisis in the Humanities? Reconfiguring Literary Study for the Twenty-first Century" (2004) Perloff argues for a return to poetics (671) in as much as poetics used to be and can continue to function as a branch of philosophy (672). Poetry has always been classified as one of the arts (672) and, like novels for the cultural critic, poetry can also do "cultural work" (673), that is to say, poetry is also historical. For Perloff, a return to poetics would contain the damage done by the contemporary fear of the pleasures of representation and rec- ognition that have trivialized the status of literary status in the academy. Like other critics in this section Perloff argues that literature is indeed one of the highest of human achievements and criticism should not only restore that intrinsic value to fiction and poetry but, more importantly, pass on to future generations the capacity to rediscover the pleasure of reading. Such a move would come full circle and restore literature to the central role in humanist education that Ren6 Wellek feared it would loose ("Destroying Literary Stud- ies" (1983)) under the epistemic claims of theory. Thirty years ego Wellek feared that literature, as postulated by Michel Foucault's discourse theory, would be subsumed under a sort of cultural and social history of letters. Wellek feared even more Derrida's deconstructionism. 483</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS He was particularly anxious about a theory that he said asserted that man lives in a prison house of language that has no relation to reality (43). Wellek saw this thesis as particularly indebted to Nietzsche's characterization of truth as a "mobile marching army of metaphors, metonymies and anthropomorph- isms [...], illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions" (43), and of course to Saussure's consideration of the referential function of language as irrelevant (43). For Wellek what was in play here was nothing less than the abolition of man, the denial of the self and the opening to a blinding nihilism that permitted the followers of Derrida to contend that poetry names the void, and Derrida himself to offer a "world of signs without truth, and without origin [ ... ] beyond man and humanism" (43). Restoring to language the capacity to name, infusing poetry with the power to speak the world, would indeed assuage Wellek's fears, but the history of the last forty years shows that, despite a large and capacious critique of deconstruc- tion, theory's ascent could not be contained. Perhaps one needs to ask if the explanation for the success of theory, given its many philosophical flaws, lies not with the strength of its claims, but rather with a historical convergence of forces in the American academy that guaranteed its success and kept it afloat long after the chief theorists-Lacan, Foucault, Derrida-ceased to be important in Europe. Perhaps a socio-historical perspective on the reproduc- tion of discourses of power would shed some light on the inefficacy of the critique of deconstruction. Not all critics share Wellek's perspectives or fears. Many take more nuanced approaches or offer more detailed critiques. John M. Ellis, for example, asks if theory is really to blame for the malaise in literary criticism. The author of Against Deconstruction (1989) advances the idea that it is not theory that has made everything political but rather bad theory. He contends that "bad theory is largely a one-way street, going only from the general to the particular: the theory prescribes political and social attitudes as the basis of what criticism should do and literature should be, but it cannot allow for feed back from literature itself because that would show that there is more to literature than this particular theory can allow" (93). Ellis reminds the reader that literary theory has a history which critics enthused by deconstruction ignore at their own peril. The forgetting effect of theory has led proponents and practitio- ners of new historicism, for instance, to forget that literary historicism has a history, one that was propounded, not so long ago, by the German philoso- pher J. G. Herder. Herder's cultural relativism held that "literature should be measured not by normative ideas such as those in Aristotle's Poetics but by the standards of its own time and culture" (95). But the problem that arises is how to determine what is relevant within the historical background. New Criticism is in fact the reaction against this lack of focus and criteria. Ellis then asks, "What contribution have race-gender-class theorists made to this discussion?" (96). For Ellis, they have, ironically, essentially adopted the historicist position. The race-gender-class critics have also added a belief in the zeitgeist, an assumption that politics is the most important content of 484</page><page sequence="5">MLN literature and the idea that the most basic concern of politics is oppression through imperialism (96). For Ellis, this composite of ideas constitutes New Historicism, and while the focus is now not lacking, there is a reduction of the number of issues in both politics and literature. Ellis takes New Historicism to task for its adoption of zeitgeist theory and finds it a telling irony that German scholars abandoned the idea of the "spirit of the time" precisely because of the unrealistic uniformity it assumed (97). For Ellis, New Historicism does not really contribute new theoretical analyses. It does better with "dogmatic assumptions" (97) that support the idea that literary works are generated from and directed towards the politics of a given period. This only shows that New Historicism can be faulted for the same anachronism leveled at the old historicism (97). Ellis marshals an impressive series of arguments to deconstruct the race-gender-class criticism, not the least of which is an appeal to Charles S. Pierce's legacy on the "impossibility of producing a final test of the truth of any proposition" (101). He points out that this idea about the validity of scientific truth, once popularized by Thomas Khun in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), reached scholars in the humanities with "bizarre results" (101). "The trouble was that the humanists who now took up these ideas knew nothing of their context and development and therefore did not realize that they had long since become familiar to philosophers of science. Instead they thought that something cataclysmic had happened: for humanists the nature of scientific truth itself seemed to have been undermined" (102). Ellis's contention that the problem has been not theory but bad, often decontextualized, advancement of propositions that reflect on the problem of signification, describes problems in many fields beyond English, cultural studies and post-colonial studies. It certainly describes the situation of literary and cultural studies in reference to Latin America. Ellis is not alone in decrying the overwhelming production of "theoretical" readings that reduce the interpretative parameters of many complex and singularly dynamic texts to race-gender-class readings (101). In a sense Ellis would agree with Tzvetan Todorov, who in "Traveling Through American Criticism" (1984), finds deconstruction to be a sort of dogmatic skepticism (55). Todorov's critique of J. Hillis Miller and Paul de Mann goes even further, for he argues that dogmatic skepticism "decides in advance what each texts means-namely nothing" (55). In doing so, decon- struction encourages the production of monotonous readings in as much they will "all make the same findings-oppression of race-class-gender" (55). Todorov believes that "this dogmatic aspect is doubtless what accounts for deconstruction's extraordinary success in academic institutions: the formula has only to be applied to new subject matter to result in an 'original' ex- egesis" (55). Todorov links deconstruction to pragmatism in their common Nietzschean origins (57). He points out that they have common enemies too: universal values, justice, ethics, truth, knowledge, science (57). In the face of this powerful critical school, Todorov asks "what recourse is open to those who continue to believe that literary works have some relation to the 485</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS world and that some values are better than others, that some are even worth fighting for?" (57). While Todorov's question encapsulates the thrust of this volume, the answer he offers may not be generally shared. Looking at the map of the American academy, Todorov finds that the only other position here is Marxism, "so that the choice boils down to a straight forward one between post-structural- ism and Marxism" (57). Todorov briefly describes the Marxism that he has in mind. "Marxist criticism recognizes the relation of literary works to the world and to values, but it rejects universality: truth and justice are grounded in history, rather than reason" (58). Todorov thinks that Marxism thus conceived, as an oppositional force to poststructuralism, is not as radical as one may think, for above and beyond quarrels, both schools are fighting a common enemy: humanism. He finds in Michel Foucault the best attempt to hybridize these two schools. The path for the future, according to Todorov is a "critical humanism," one that would hopefully avoid the camouflage of European colonialism (58). For Todorov the guiding question remains: what does the text mean? Theory's Empire does offer a very good sampling of the struggle that the American academy has witnessed over the meaning of the text. It shows that the struggle over theory has been fundamentally political. Another volume might show what gains have been made with the best of New Historicism, Post-Marxism, Post-colonial theory, to name a few positions that of course are not here debated for the liberating power that they brought in relation to the received understandings. In the field of Latin American letters and non-alphabetic representations alone, colonial studies would not be the same without "theory," for better mainly and for worse some of the time. It has had more that its share of the same results always already. As the importance of literature inevitably continues to diminish with the rise of film and elec- tronic communications, the fights over the meaning of the text and who is competent to establish that meaning, become only more cutting and press- ing. This is true not only in the classroom and the university setting but in society at large. If culture as a whole, and the writing of history itself, are to be examined as if they were primarily textual artifacts, choosing one's own interpretative approach is a decision of paramount importance. Beyond the problem of philosophical grounding, the question of ethics seems paramount. Pointing to the shortcomings of deconstruction is indeed a salutary activity, although I am sure that many readers will find the volume reiterative. How- ever, getting passed the insufficiencies of deconstruction will call for much more than restoring literature and literary interpretation to a central place in the humanities for the very definition of literature has been profoundly and critically altered. The humanities are indeed experiencing a crisis that is related to the excesses of deconstruction. However, to circumscribe the crisis to the deconstruction alone would give it too much credit. The crisis in the humanities is actually more closely linked to the global social and economic forces that are redefining knowledges and persons as individuals, citizens and 486</page><page sequence="7">MLN interpreters of themselves and the world. Theory's Empire offers a powerful retrospect on the rise of "Theory" in the American academy despite a highly charged and relentless critique, but I am not sure that a return to poetics or to a consensus on the "high value of literature" is really going to lead us out of the crisis. This volume will be necessary assignment in all courses dealing with theory. The Johns Hopkins University SARA CASTRO-KLAREN Magali Roy-Fequiere, Women, Creole Identity, and Intellectual Life in Early Twentieth-Century Puerto Rico. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 2004. xi + 310 pp. The revisionist turn in Puerto Rican literary criticism that emerged around the 1980s coincided with two intellectual trends that signaled a major shift in conceptual frameworks: the production of numerous historical studies on the island, to mark the beginning of what has been called "la nueva historiografia" in Puerto Rico; and the establishment of Women's Studies programs, to indicate the constitution of gender as a legitimate object of study in academic disciplines in universities throughout the world. All three projects entailed bringing to light cultural practices that previous scholars had forgotten or overlooked. Magali Roy-Fequiere's Women, Creole Identity, and Intellectual Life in Early Twentieth-Century Puerto Rico follows suit in the sense of recovering the voices of women and blacks in her reassessment of texts from a significant moment in Puerto Rican cultural history: the Generation of 1930. Reportedly derived from a doctoral dissertation, the book takes up a recurring issue in Puerto Rican intellectual discourse ever since the island's insertion into the U.S. political space in 1898: the perceived need to construct a recognizably Puerto Rican identity in a modern colonial society. The book's eight chapters are preceded by an introduction, where the author provides a historical overview of the period in question, and outlines the theoretical and critical framework for the analyses that follow. Here, she sets forth her general idea of Puerto Rican nationalist discourse as a locus of "creation and invention" (2), an idea derived from Eric Hobsbawm's concept of invented traditions. Roy-Fequi&amp;re also locates her study within the fields of Women's Studies and Cultural Studies, as is evident from the following state- ment: "My argument is that discourses of national identification presuppose certain gender relations that have complicated ramifications for those they address as well as for those they marginalize. [... ] Moreover, the women intellectuals of my study often do not-or cannot-escape the dominant practice of inscribing the subject as male and white" (7-8).
