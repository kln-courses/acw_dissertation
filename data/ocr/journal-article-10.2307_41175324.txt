<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christian Education Vol. XXXII JUNE, 1949 No. 2 Religious Knowledge and Higher Education BERNARD IDDINGS BELL PURPOSE to offer what seem to me a few pertinent remarks about the proper relationship between religious knowledge and the work of an institution of higher learning. I may say at once that I do not see that this relationship is essentially different whether higher education is conducted under the auspices of a religious body or under secular auspices. In a true sense every college, if it is indeed an institution of higher learning, is unde- nominational. A denominational college, Catholic or Protestant or what you will, sees to it, of course, that the answer of its own communion to religious problems receives an adequate and sym- pathetic presentation, and that those who are of its traditional persuasion are given opportunity for devotional approach to God; but if the Church-related college does no more than this, if it excludes from consideration the contributions of other religious traditions, if it refuses a respectful treatment of the positions even of disbelievers in the validity of any religious tradition, then it is not properly an institution of higher learning. Similarly if a university is run under purely secular auspices - a land-grant university, for instance - it is not thereby justified in ignoring or even minimizing the importance of due and careful study of what Dr. Bell, clergyman, educator and author, is Canon of the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul, Chicago. Such parts of this article as are from Dr. Bell's book, Crisis in Education (Whittlesey House, New York, 1949), are used here by permission of the publisher. [89]</page><page sequence="2">Christian Education religion has been and what it is, what religion has contributed and still contributes toward the increase of human knowledge and understanding. Since the purpose of higher education is solely the advance- ment of knowledge, it may clarify our understanding of the sub- ject under consideration if we consider, not at too great length, what knowledge is. Knowledge consists of experience digested by reason. Rea- son arranges in some sort of order what has been encountered and observed, either directly or by imaginative sharing the experience of others. Education involves, therefore, a training of the reason logically and competently to function and also a securing of as large and profound and balanced an experience as possible. There are five varieties of human experiences, and none of them can be neglected in a sound education. The first type of experience consists of direct acceptance of nature, nature in all its charm and intricate variety. This is not the same thing as scientific experience, to which it bears much the same relationship that poetry bears to literary criticism. Just as one may be a critic of poetry and yet have no appreciation of poetry and sometimes drive the poem as poem quite out the win- dow, even so one may be no end of a scientist and yet altogether miss the significance of nature, nature as something to be respected and loved. This first sort of experience embraces the totality of things, approached with acceptance rather than analysis. Experience of this sort helps to induce such a sense of inner unity with that which naturally is as results in humility, admira- tion, serenity in the midst of strife. To teach reverence for nature to the youth of America today, especially to those who must live in the larger places, is difficult ; but unless a college does it some- how and does it well, wise and wholesome graduates will not be turned out by that college. The second variety of experience is scientific experience. Every man is to some degree a scientist; he can learn things by using his Åˆve senses; he can hear and see and taste and touch and smell, and measure what he sensibly perceives. The third category of experience is quite different from either of the first two ; and it is as necessary as either or both [90]</page><page sequence="3">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education if a man would grow competently toward knowing. I can manipu- late sound, form, color, words until they do my will, until they embody insights into order and significance which originate not in them but in me. I can make them carry my vision so clearly that I can convey it to others and intensify it within myself. This is what is known as creative, or artistic experience. I can do still another sort of thing ; I can discover, appreciate, evaluate, and to a degree understand other persons. The process of perceiving them and coming into some degree of unity with them is a thing difficult to describe, but we all know what it is. Only a little does it depend upon what the five senses reveal; it is different from sensing the dignity of nature; it has not much to do with creative art. Its name is mystical experience. There is no human experience which does not come under one of the heads just mentioned. At least potentially and to some extent actually every human being is a scientist, a nature valuer, an artist, a lover or mystic. Through all of these he finds him- self more and more in touch with what is external to himself ; and the more he is thus variously in touch with Reality the more he understands himself. By means of a manifold experience he reaches out to his world, gropes toward the totality of things. Each kind of experience furnishes him with material that reason may examine, weigh, relate to what previously has been ex- perienced. It needs to be recognized, further, that the fourth variety, mystical experience, always has been and is and always will be of two subvarieties : the first, experience of contingent persons; the second, experience of cm ultimate Person, to which latter has been given the name "religion." Sometimes the humanist thinks that the only contact of person with person which is possible or necessary is contact with men and women. In this he is almost certainly mistaken. On examination a humanist usually turns out to be either one who has degenerated from religion because he has found the search for God too mentally exacting or too emotion- ally exhausting or else one who has perceived the inadequacy of things but has not had enough practice in living to discover that human companionships are also insufficient. The humanist is [91]</page><page sequence="4">Christian Education almost sure to gravitate either toward scientific mechanism, nega- tion of purpose, essential hopelessness, or toward theism. There are, then, really five manners of experience. An ade- quate college program involves developing an increasing expert- ness in all of them : scientific, appreciation of the nature of things, creative art, social relationships, religion. If the cultivation of any one is omitted, an avenue is closed toward understanding and harmony with Reality. Omit any one or leave it in an embryonic state and the student becomes, quite literally, unbalanced. It is worthwhile to look back on education in times past and note how the five sorts of experience have been combined, in varying degrees of balance or the lack of it. Hellenic Education Let us first look at Hellenic education. The Greeks com- bined the creative discipline and the scientific discipline with a reverence for things that are, for nature per se, in a harmony never excelled since their time. An Attic youth was helped con- stantly to regard himself, first of all, as an artist. No people has ever had such appreciation of artistic achievement, a more general good taste, a greater ability to shape exquisite objects even for vulgar uses. Equally, the Greeks were devoted to science. For at least fifteen hundred years after the period of their greatest vigor, neither in perfection of scientific method nor in volume of observed fact did any people excel them ; and only the Arabs came anywhere near to equalling them. The third discipline, experi- ence in human relationships, they also brought to a high degree of cultivation. As for their reverence for things that are, for nature as a whole, no one who has read their literature can doubt it. The defect in Hellenic education was that it neglected the cultivation of contact with ultimate Personality. The Greeks in their flowering period were as nearly irreligious as men well can be. They abandoned faith in the gods. Olympus became the habitat of what were scarcely more than personifications of man's passions or, in the minds of the learned, protagonists of speculative concepts. The Greek became a contented skeptic - in the end, of [92]</page><page sequence="5">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education course, a by no means contented skeptic but still a skeptic. He rarely sought communion with the challenging Reality beyond him, with the hidden strength beneath him. Like every irreligious person, he was more and more weakened by conceit. Hellas be- came an easy prey to peoples more aspiring, more visionary. The Persians undermined its culture. Rome absorbed the wreckage. Next let us look at Roman education. The Romans were a literal-minded, matter-of-fact, highly efficient set of parvenus. Like all newly rich upstarts they bought up the culture of their predecessors and vulgarized it. They took over the Aegean methods of education, including a tolerant in- difference toward religion. Their arts were for the most part pedestrian and imperceptive. Soon their gods were only variants of the Olympian family and, like the originals, of small relevancy to thought or life. The only cult that mattered in imperial Rome was the worship of the military power of the emperor, of the state. Roman education starved the human hunger for a truth higher than may be discovered by physical experiment, for beauty beyond human power to create, for goodness that is more than canny benevolence and patriotism. The Greeks had had science, crea- tive art, social amenities, reverence for that which is, and no re- ligion to speak of. The Romans went in seriously only for ap- plied science ; the rest of their culture was imitative. When Christianity came into this Romanized world, the re- leased enthusiasm for religion that followed was like the rushing of a long-pent flood. A people which for a great many years had believed only in itself and in the things of the senses became at great speed a people seeking with fanatic interest knowledge of that which is beyond this world. After the Empire had slowly crumbled from within, after the resulting confusion had resolved itself at last into the order of the Middle Ages, an educational system emerged fitted for the new emphasis on religion. This education had an other-worldly unbalance in respect to the cate- gories of experience. The Middle Ages were not ignorant or without culture, but they were lopsided. The teaching of the period made much-pro- portionately too much - of religious knowledge. Artistic, or crea- tive, experience was, it is true, not neglected. Rarely have the [93]</page><page sequence="6">Christian Education arts flourished more vitally than among those who painted the primitives, brought the plain chant to perfection, carved Gothic statuary and ornament, raised the great cathedrals. What medie- val man neglected was what the Greco-Roman world had most valued, namely, experience of fact. Only rarely have men and women been so little interested in the visible and tangible universe. The absurdity of this maladjustment began to attract the at- tention of leading minds, and possibly there would have been a normal recovery of balance had it not been for the Crusades. By themselves and through their aftermath the Crusades were des- tined to sidetrack educational rebalance for several centuries. They sent armies of by-no-means unintelligent people from the West into what is now Greece and the Near East, where much of the literary and artistic treasure of the ancient world had been pre- served. The Crusaders brought back home with them, for good and for ill, contacts with the long-ignored remnants of more an- cient days. This did not result in the introduction into Western culture and education of that science for lack of which the Middle Ages were growing sterile. Instead, the Crusaders returned with an almost incredibly absurd faith that all the wisdom man could ever gain was to be found in the classical authors, numerous manuscripts of whose works they bore home with superstitious reverence. In vain wiser men protested against the substitution of resurrected thought for original thought. The day of "Classical Humanism" had arrived. So powerful was the Classical Humanist movement that it captured the schools and universities. It left an impress upon education which can even now be felt. Growth of Inductive Science Classical humanism made the Renaissance, but it has had little to do with the making of the world of today. The controlling element in the development of modern culture has been the growth of inductive science, to which neither the Middle Ages nor the Renaissance gave much attention. The renewed interest in observing facts accurately and reason- ing out generalizations on the basis of such observations, which is what inductive science is, began, it is true, back in the Middle [94]</page><page sequence="7">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education Ages. It is interesting to speculate about what might have come into being in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries from a com- bination of scientific induction, scholastic deduction, and a highly developed religious technique. From such a union might have resulted the most perfect thought and the most adequate education ever known. But, as we have said, Classical Humanism interfered. Then the Reformation, child of the Renaissance, split Europe; and inductive science was retired by Protestant leaders to a limbo even more Stygian than that into which medieval Catholicism had pushed it, to reemerge in modern days only in unbalanced reaction. The distinguishing feature of modern education has been this rise of scientific interest and a development of scientific method at the increasing cost of the other experiential disciplines, including of course that of religion. Of any observable phenomenon science asks: "What is this?" and "Whence comes it?" and "How does it behave?" With the "Why ?" of anything, with its essential meaning, with more subtle matters than can be observed through the senses, science is not concerned. No reputable scientist denies this limitation. His in- terest as a scientist lies with facts and forces and with nothing else. Science has transformed almost everything. Some of its many good products have been intricate machines which have made pos- sible for the masses possessions and activities undreamed of before, even as luxuries, curative and preventive medical and surgical devices and sanitary arrangements which have doubled the span of life for the ordinary man, means of communication which have brought all nations into neighborhood with one another, though not into 'peace. More important still is the vast knowledge of the cosmos, of matter-energy, which has been dug out and classified - "pure science" as distinct from "applied science." This new knowledge is wholly to the good. Most unfortunate, however, has been an increasing assump- tion, now held by a majority of people, including an immense number of educators, that scientific knowledge is the only knowl- edge that really is knowledge at all. This notion is pernicious, dangerous to mankind. The chief problem in education today is how to restore a realization that man is meant to be not merely a scientific methodologist and mechanical workman but also a poet, [95]</page><page sequence="8">Christian Education a dreamer, a mystic, an artist, and a philosopher. There are a good many thinking people, including some eminent scientists, who fear that in an excessive devotion to science we are becoming - indeed have already largely become - as lopsided as were any of our ancestors, that our higher education has again become un- balanced ; who feel that we are leaving dormant, undeveloped, the artistic, creative, poetic, religious faculties; who believe that we are out of touch with the wide stream of human experience and in peril because of it. It is not necessary nowadays that a college stress the importance of cultivating scientific experience and re- quire some study of it for a degree. Nor is there much need for a college to present a brief for the necessity of cultivating powers of artistic creativeness or promoting social experience or of par- ticipation in the esthetic disciplines or of social studies. What must be reemphasized is that if a human being is permitted to leave out a required consideration of what religious experience is, he is being deprived of an access to Reality which properly is his. It is not by following the pathway of dialectic argument that undergraduates are best led to an appreciation of religion as a factor in life and therefore of education, but rather by considering the vast number of highly intelligent and useful people, both past and present, who have known Reality in terms of experience of an ultimate Person, who have found that there is in the universe something which corresponds to the ability of man to arrive at personal contacts. The wise religionist constantly studies and bids other men study the spiritual geniuses of the race. From them alone may be reached an understanding of the proper place in edu- cation of religious experience. # There always has existed and still exists, behind a not al- together lovely ecclesiastical shell, giving it meaning, the quiet life of the long succession of the saints, the people who have been in comradeship with God and who through that comradeship have found peace. It is these seeking and finding souls who reveal to us the nature of the religious experience and its importance in a balanced knowledge, in an adequate philosophy. The religion with which a college needs to concern itself is a mystical thing. When we examine the lives and writings of the saints we discover that to them religion 15 nothing less than a [96]</page><page sequence="9">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education living and conscious experience of contact with a Spirit, a Mean- ing, who is before all things and in all things and beyond all things; who loves as no mortal being can love; who can be loved with a degree of self-surrender such as no created being will permit us ; who through that love reveals such significance, such possibilities, in the world and in man's self, as are not only past words to express but past the power of man otherwise to discover. To be religious is to find essentially within one's uni- verse a love past knowledge, to taste peace beyond imagination; to feel, all unafraid, the pulsing energy which eternally creates all things, including ourselves. Such is the experience of the mystics, and such is their admittedly symbolical language. Their witness cannot be ignored by anyone who is looking for an adequate edu- cation - and will not be, except for prejudice. The Role of the Religionist The role of the religionist in higher education today is very much like that of the scientist in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ; he vigorously protests against an undue curtailment of experience. The religionist has replaced the scientist as the re- minding voice from the wilderness. He cries aloud that what man most needs to cultivate is what he most neglects, that he should supplement his knowledge of facts with that knowledge of supreme Personality, which gives meaning to facts and to life. The religionist is quite sure that the modern college is not leading modern man into the full stream of human experience, that modern man needs to be reintroduced to the contemplation of God. He insists that unless modern man be so persuaded, the human race will continue to grow increasingly unbalanced. For a long time the necessity of co-operation between the re- ligionist and the scientist in the quest for truth and in an adequate education has not been recognized ; and those who in reality have no quarrel have become highly suspicious of one another. This suspicion is not chiefly due to the scientists or to the religionists but rather to a third group of people. The leading scientists at the moment do not seem to be against religion. Indeed, they are often alarmingly sympathetic [97]</page><page sequence="10">Christian Education toward religion. Their will to assist in its reutterance is not always tempered by knowledge. They say extraordinary and sometimes ignorant things when they endeavor to make pronounce- ments about God and the spirit. But, while many of the utter- ances of leading scientists about religion are more than a little childish, from what they say it is at least certain that they are not opposed to religion. Many of the best of them are vocally desirous of finding a way to supplement the knowledge which they have gained scientifically, whose intrinsic limitations no one understands better than themselves. It is another group who sit in the seat of the scorners and disturb intellectual clarity: The bright young people of between the wars. They seem unaware that the world of thought has moved in the last twenty years. They control organs of expres- sion which help mold the ideas of the ignorant; they edit sub- sidized journals of opinion ; they construct most of the smart columns and syndicated editorials in the daily press ; they write most of our plays and movies ; they are to be found in large num- bers in our literary faculties and in our schools of education. Their stock in trade consists for the most part of the follow- ing things: (i) an openmouthed admiration for science, all the greater because they have rarely submitted themselves to the humbling discipline of scientific technique; (2) a vast contempt for the religions of the past, which they have rarely taken the trouble to examine; (3) an insistence upon a supposed analogy between the universe and an evolving organism, an analogy which fails to take into consideration lately discovered physiochemical phenomena that make organic evolution seem only an incidental feature of the cosmic scheme; (4) a strange joy in maintaining that man is but a beast, combined with a delicate pacifism which, be it admirable or not, at least is inconsistent with beastliness - a sort of desire to be Nietzche and John Dewey at the same time; and (5) a willingness to reverse the old prescription and say in- stead of, "You shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free," rather, "By mere freedom from standards and restraints you will arrive at the truth." The world of thought is moving away from these persons, but they still continue to muddy the waters in education. The [98]</page><page sequence="11">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education best thing for a college to do with them is to ignore them. If the physical scientists, the religionists, the naturalists, the artists and the students of human contacts can turn jointly to the reconsidera- tion of what constitutes an education, to the restoration of sound thinking based upon adequate experience; there will be less con- fusion of mind in educational circles and more of that mutually helpful co-operation which properly exists between those who, by various methods and by complementary avenues, are seeking the one Truth. The necessity facing the modern college has been well stated by that highly distinguished scientist who is Director of the Shef- field Scientific School at Yale, Dr. Edmund W. Sinnott. Address- ing those gathered to keep the centennial of that school in October, 1947, he said: "Men of science minister to the world in many ways, but perhaps their most important service now is to join hands heartily with their colleagues in all other fields, assuring our young men today, upon whose shoulders soon will rest such grave responsibilities, that breadth and catholicity of education from which alone can grow the wisdom they must have to save a desperate world." "This," he went on, "is the grave mandate of our universities. Never in history have they been called upon to render service to humanity as great as this. Man, not matter, is the chief problem of the world today. If we train his mind to master material things without at the same time enlarging his spirit so that he may appreciate the value of immaterial things and thus become the master of himself, he is but half a man. The greatest peril now is not from lack of education but from one- sided, partly educated men. Only whole men can save the world today and to train them well is the imperative task of every uni- versity." I have talked over with any number of educators the neglect of religion by most of our institutions of higher education. I have asked why religion is not taught as a discipline as basic and re- spectable as the scientific discipline, the creative discipline, the social discipline. I have pointed out that ignorance of religion and religions lessens the human impulse toward endurance and daring as well as toward compassion and charity ; that it prevents a right valuation of human motives and therefore hinders a sound [99]</page><page sequence="12">Christian Education understanding of history, sociology, human behavior in general; that it interferes with appreciation of the arts ; that - but it is not necessary to go on. The greater part of those to whom I have spoken do not for a moment deny ( Î¹ ) that American higher edu- cation does ignore the powerful and unavoidable character of re- ligion and (2) that by this ignoring it does great harm to its stu- dents both as individuals and as builders of a sound society. But, they ask, how can one teach religion in a university committed to no sectarian approach to life or truth? There are so many religions, so many varieties even of Christianity, to take cnly one of the religions - three hundred or so kinds of Protestants and at least three varieties of Catholics, Roman, Orthodox, Angli- can ; various sorts of Judaism. To none of these may a university commit itself without constriction of outlook. They say, these conscientious and troubled directors of higher education, that for the sake of peace and good-will on the quadrangles the wise thing to do is to bar religion altogether from university consideration. By the same reasoning higher education ought, it would seem, to bar the teaching of philosophy, since philosophers differ among themselves so widely ; and history, because of the varying theories held about history ; and politics, for fear of offending Democrats or Fascists or Communists; and science, because mechanists and vitalists debate vigorously and often hatefully about the meaning of what has been discovered scientifically. But no, it seems the danger is only serious when we come to religion. Their fears are mostly thoughtless and conventional, unreal and unimaginative. I know they are, know it from experience. In a college where I once occupied a chair, I was asked by the faculty to look after a year's required undergraduate course intended to help them relate their religion to the scientific disci- plines to which they were being introduced. The students came from widely varied backgrounds ; Anglican, Lutheran, Protestant of every sort, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, Jewish Liberal, as well as backgrounds that bade them look upon religion as nothing more than an archaic superstition. At the end of a year I was compelled to report to my col- leagues that what they desired could not be done. The trouble is not that it is impossible, or even difficult, to correlate religion [100]</page><page sequence="13">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education and science, but that our students have nÃ² religion to relate to anything, at least no religion which involves thinking, no religion about which one can talk intelligently. With rare exceptions, all they possess in the way of religion is some vague loyalty to an ecclesiastical group - about half of them have this; a number of prejudices, chiefly against communions other than that with which they are vaguely affiliated; a few quaint moral taboos; scarcely more than infantile notions about God; devotional techniques which rarely go much beyond "Now I lay me" and "God bless papa and mama." One cannot tie that sort of thing up to what is arrived at by way of scientific study. Maybe it would be well, I suggested, if the faculty would permit me first to teach the men, objectively and with no care for what might be their reactions, a little about what religion has been and still is and about what religious people of the major faiths today believe and do and why they believe and do it. The administration consented, and for several years the course was taught. Former students write me even yet to express thanks for the help it gave them. The object was to present, with no attempt to influence the student's belief or disbelief in anything, the basic facts, ideas and practices back of all religions and, in particular, back of Judaism and Christianity, the religion of the West. The following topics were dealt with seriatim : 1. The concept of supernatural reality; religion as an attempt to find contact with that reality; a review of the development of religion from its vague beginnings in a sense of manu, on through fetishism, animism, anthropomorphism, henotheism, to mono- theism. 2. The basic concepts back of religious practice; the concept of sin, the concept of salvation by sacrifice, the concept of mystical aspiration, the concept of prayer (together with something of prayer technique). 3. The development of Judaism from the animism of Genesis through the anthropomorphism of Abraham and the henotheism of Moses to the moralized monotheism of the later prophets ; a brief survey of Jewish history as throwing light upon this develop- [101]</page><page sequence="14">Christian Education ment ; a brief survey of *the Old Testament, with comment upon its folklore, legal codes, history, poetry, drama and philosophy. 4. The Christian religion, both as a development from Juda- ism and as a new thing in its concept of Incarnate God seeking man in response to the search of man for God ; the effect of this concept upon the ideas of sin, sacrifice, mystical aspiration and prayer. 5. The concept of the Church as the mystical body of Incar- nate God; reliance upon grace or supernatural help from Christ, the conquering Comrade; the two major and five minor sacra- ments; the priestly and prophetic ministry. 6. The story of Catholic Christianity to the Reformation : its basis of authority in religion; the definition of doctrine in the fourth and fifth centuries; the growth of the papacy; the schism between East and West ; the place of the Church in the medieval world; the significance of monasticism; the weakening of the medieval ideal. 7. Protestant Christianity: its basis of authority, the Bible; its relationship to Humanism and to the rise of nationality ; Lu- ther's main principles and those of Calvin; the wars over defini- tion; the triumphant era of Protestantism; its undermining by biblical criticism and the development of science. Also the rise of modernism, with the principles thereof. Also the Counter- Reformation in the Roman Church. Also the Anglo-Catholic position. 8. The Christian ethical life: its emphasis upon positive rather than negative morality ; the conventional analyses of sins - positive and negative, thought, word and deed, personal and so- cial; the technique of repentance, the Catholic sacrament of Pen- ance and its Protestant equivalents ; moral conversion as a process rather than a sudden achievement. 9. Christian worship: the Catholic sacrifice of the Mass; the ancient offices ; the worship of Protestantism ; the service of beauty to worship ; the more usual vestments and ornaments of worship. The intention was not to convince the student but to inform him. So carefully was this kept in mind that never once was there the slightest indignation at the presentation on the part of Roman Catholics, Anglicans, various kinds of Protestants, Jews. As the [102]</page><page sequence="15">Religious Knowledge and Higher Education course went on the result was usually that each student understood more fully the implications of his own inchoate religion and also came to a fair appreciation of the practices and beliefs of those brought up in ways different from his own. It deepened convic- tion and cultivated tolerance. Unless religion is studied in some such objective fashion as this, unless it is looked at as a part of the race's experience, it is not likely that reactions toward it will be anything but sentimental, unhealthy, denominational, divisive; if it is so studied, the bogie of a possible sectarianism is soon dispelled. Whatever be deemed a proper answer to the question of how to restore a religious understanding to the secularized and there- fore lopsided approach to learning and life which characterizes most higher education today, one thing ought to be clear, namely, that the problem is primarily not one of undergraduate incapacity or indifference but rather one of faculty neglect. The undergraduate by and large takes his beliefs and dis- beliefs, his likes and dislikes, his notions and his prejudices from his instructors. There are a few rare souls among undergraduates who question the ipse dixits of professors ; the vast majority have neither desire nor ability to do so. Even the occasional rebels are less resistant than they think they are. What the faculty thinks, the student will think also. Certainly this is the case in respect to the place of religion in pursuit of knowledge. Con- sequently, in seeking to restore to higher education a diet which will include religion of some sort as a necessity to sound thinking and sane doing, attention should be concentrated where it rightly belongs, on the administration and the staff of scholar-teachers. It seems to many thoughtful observers that the attitude of the teaching staff is curiously overlooked by those who approach the problem of how to get on with, possibly to improve, higher education in respect to religion. Their aim seems, rather, to be the plausibly laudable one of dealing with the religion of under- graduates as though it could be immunized from the attitudes toward religion which originate at the higher scholarly levels. Nothing could be more unreal. The problem of religion and higher education will never be solved by undergraduate bull ses- sions or by more deftly led discussion groups as long as these re-</page><page sequence="16">Christian Education main extracurricular, extramural, or by special courses taught by a Department of Religion whose activities, optional or required, are regarded with polite tolerance, or even scorn, by the faculty people generally. A few undergraduates may perhaps be salvaged by such approaches; but while we are saving them from intellec- tual blind spots many more are being infected by irreligious con- tagion. What is most needed is to get at the administration and the staff. Because many of us are deeply concerned with the unbalanced approach to truth which has for too long a time characterized our modern secularized higher education, we welcome the emphasis on Religion as contributory to sound thinking which has begun again to be placed at Yale, at Princeton, at the University of Iowa, in other quarters. ****** MORE MINISTERS ATTEND SEMINARY Between 1938 and 1947 numbers of Protestant seminarians rose from 13,000 to 24,000, Roman Catholic from 16,000 to 23,000, Jews from 900 to 2,000. The rise in Protestant numbers is partly caused by the fact that many "Bible schools" are rated now as seminaries. A third of the Protestants and a tenth of the Jews and of the Catholics (who usually start seminary training early) are veterans. At one major seminary - as TIME reported re- cently - the age of the average seminarian is now 28, while ten years ago it was 23. * * * * TEEN-AGERS LEAVE SCHOOL BY MILLIONS In 1947, the Census Bureau says, Î¹Ï„/2 million of the 9 mil- lion American youth of 14 to 17 had dropped out of school: 970,000 had completed only a grade-school course, while the other 559,000 quit during high school years. Cash value of staying in school for as long as possible was revealed by figures that median salaries for the non-high school group were at 44 years of age $1,806 and at 64, $2,097 - while high school graduate earnings at these same ages were respectively in excess of $2,403 and $2,954. Protestantism has a stake in maximum education of all. (Statis- tics are for non-farm youth.) [104]</page></plain_text>
