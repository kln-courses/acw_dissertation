      <p>Epigraphic and archaeological data documenting the development of cultural complexity in southern Arabia suggest that first millennium South Arabian kingdoms are the outcomes of long-term indigenous social dynamics largely unrelated to centralized manipulation of agricultural surplus. In theoretical terms, a general cultural-evolutionary sequence has long been thought key to understanding the formation of hierarchically ordered, politically centralized societies in antiquity from antecedents, usually characterized as chiefdoms (Earle 1991; cf. Yoffee 1995, 2005), or kinship-based communities of relatively high-density and sedentary populations, supported by an agricultural base whose resources (land, surplus) were held and distributed by hereditary members of an ethnic or kin-based group. There are good reasons to broaden the inventory of autochthonic social complexity cases to include South Arabia in the first millennium BC. Archaeological evidence now shows that South Arabian kingdoms, perhaps better described as federations (Magee 2013) or urban-based tribal polities (Schiettecatte 2008:40), are a case of indigenous, if late, complex societies. They arise long after the collapse of a Bronze Age world system (Frank 1993) implicated in secondary state formation in a periphery connected to core Near Eastern states by cross-cultural exchange (Algaze 1993; Chase-Dunn and Hall 1991; Edens 1992; Frank 1993; Kohl 1997; cf. Ratnagar 2001; Stein 1999). With the possible exception of Dilmun (Bahrain), Arabian societies did not develop stratified classes and political centralization in the Bronze Age (Cleuziou 1997, 2007; Cleuziou and Tosi 2007; Newton and Zarins 2000) and in most regions were not held together through sedentary occupations. Where there were Bronze Age settlements, there were no urban sites. Significantly, later Arabian hereditary kings’ power, prestige, and access to wealth were structured through pilgrimage practices largely unrelated to agricultural surplus (McCorriston 2011:59–61, 65–68, 78–80), or to prestige goods exchanged with a core state, or to influence and tutelage of more advanced neighbors. Here as elsewhere the emphasis is not on what constitutes a state (a matter of some dispute; e.g., Cohen 1978; Crumley 1976; Possehl 1998:264) but on the developing sociocultural complexity in Iron Age and pre-Islamic Arabia, in which urban centers were ruled by hereditary kings who commanded military force to expand sovereignty and control people and whose central role in economic affairs was commemorated on large-scale public works and in the issue of coinage. Because the medium for writing economic texts was highly perishable, administrative activities, including contracts and payments, are poorly preserved. Therefore, to what extent the political economy was centralized is difficult to assess, but the emergence of South Arabian socioeconomic complexity was unequivocally rapid and independent of Assyrian or other regional state interference in the late second to early first millennium BC. This paper argues that South Arabian states instead were constituted out of the existing social dynamics of prestate indigenous and largely mobile Arabian groups.</p>
      <p>In the highly mobile world of Arabian pastoralists, the periodic gatherings and rites of pilgrimage played a paramount role in constituting social groups (McCorriston 2011). Pilgrimage ritual is not unique to Arabian social identities, but in Arabia it played an exceptional role in linking mobile peoples and very small settled populations in wider social networks to support specialized exchanges. Arabian pilgrimage is a constellation of gathering, sacrifice, and feasting at a sacred place to assemble and reify communities that are not coresident, and it is used here not to denote a particular ritual but to name the structuring practices that shape and reshape social arenas. The power of pilgrimage to constitute social identities while enabling economic exchanges has been extensively discussed elsewhere (e.g., Lahti 1994; McCorriston 2011; Morinis 1992; Wheeler 1999). The social dynamics of Arabian pastoralists practicing pilgrimage point to an alternative for the prevalent cultural-evolutionary model of state formation grounded in materialism with an accumulation of staple agricultural surplus and its transformation into labor, power, prestige, and luxury goods (D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1991; Stein 1994). Instead, an alternative model identifies strengthened group solidarity and the accumulation of authoritative resources by charismatic leaders as the key changes that resulted in state-level cultural complexity, with the accumulation of agricultural surplus and wealth-based maintenance of prestige and power as later phenomena. Although difficult to see archaeologically, these social variables of solidarity and charisma can be formulated from the social theory of Arab historian Ibn Khaldūn and tested against the archaeological record in Ḥaḍramawt (modern eastern Yemen). Archaeological studies now trace the earliest markers of group solidarity through small-scale stone monuments erected by pastoralists and can detect pilgrimage gatherings and appropriation of authoritative resources during an era when there exist but few traces of developing agricultural settlement systems prior to the emergence of the state.</p>

         <title>Archaeological and Epigraphic Background</title>
         <p>It is difficult to trace the origins of South Arabian complex societies from extant archaeological data in southern Arabia. There is a notable dearth of evidence in the centuries just prior to the establishment of the hallmarks of Arabian cultural complexity. These hallmarks include massive public projects that enlisted substantial organized labor groups—for example, city walls and large-scale irrigation dams and canals; writing using (Ancient South Arabian) local scripts; differential status and offices based on wealth; wealth differences expressed in houses, burials, and votive offerings; and highly specialized occupations integrated in a complex economic system. South Arabian complex societies arose at about the time of the Neo-Assyrian empire (tenth–seventh centuries BC) and persisted through the middle fifth century AD. Throughout their histories, South Arabian kingdoms were manifestly engaged in exchange with other areas of the Near East, and their relatively late appearance and trade relationships suggest an influence from the great Assyrian empire to the north (Eph’al 1982; intended by Hopkins and Wallerstein 1982). But there are alternative interpretations of the South Arabian archaeological data from the third millennium BC through the middle of the first millennium BC, and many now accept that the late urban centers emerged from indigenous roots (e.g., Avanzini 2009; Cleuziou 1997; De Maigret 1990; Edens, Wilkinson, and Barratt 2000; Harrower 2008<italic>a</italic>; Schiettecatte 2006, 2008, 2010). The older diffusion-based model of exogamous origins has been fueled, on the one hand, by a perceived lack of settlement in the second millennium BC, just prior to the emergence of Arabian states (De Maigret 2002 [1996]:185), and, on the other hand, to a pervasive Wittfogelian idea linking complex societies to complex irrigation systems, inimically therefore to Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and Egypt.</p>
         <p>Surprisingly little is known of the immediate chronological predecessors of the South Arabian kingdoms, which appear full-blown in epigraphic records, in text references from northern states, and in the archaeological record of the first millennium BC. In southern and southwestern Arabia, where the Sabaean, Mineaen, Qatabānian, Awsān, and Ḥaḍramawt kingdoms flourished from the seventh century BC through the first centuries AD, evidence of writing extends only as far back as the ninth century BC (De Maigret 2002 [1996]:83; Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>:79–80) and appears as a distinct Semitic alphabet by the late second millennium (Avanzini 2009; Ryckmans 1991:30; see table 1). Archaeological evidence and dedicatory inscriptions show the founding of enclosure walls from the second millennium BC (Breton 1999:22), surely a sign of cooperative labor projects on a large scale. Such projects were notably amplified with the construction of massive, cut-stone walls, which only appeared in the first millennium BC (Breton 2002:145; Darles 2008:145–148) and represent an altogether greater investment of labor and complex organization. Also in the first millennium appeared the development of internal areas of differentiated architecture, including temple compounds from the ninth century BC. The earliest excavated Sabaean house already shows wealth in the materials and labor involved, dates to the ninth century, and lacks precedent for its scale and elaboration in construction (De Maigret 2002 [1996]:73–184; Fedele 2009; cf. Edens, Wilkinson, and Barratt 2000). Assyrian texts from the late eighth and early seventh centuries BC mention tribute or gifts from Sabaean kings, known in early Saba’ as <italic>mukarrib</italic> (Eph’al 1982; Lemaire 1996). One of South Arabia’s earliest historical inscriptions (RES 3945) is also among the most famous. It is the seventh-century BC account of <italic>mukarrib</italic> Karib’il Watar’s military defeat of the Awsān state and the destruction of its palace, king, and sublimation to the tribal confederacy of Sabaeans under the federal god Almaqah, at which time the states of Awsān and Ḥaḍramawt were already named as vassals of the Sabaean confederacy (Hoyland 2001:39; Robin 1996:55–58).<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float">

         <p>Epigraphic evidence appears in the first millennium BC and documents the practices of fully developed archaic states. It is available from dedicatory inscriptions in temples and on significant public works, historical and genealogical inscriptions, and few cursive documents on perishable media. The highly visible and much vaunted irrigation works like the great Mar’ib dam that supported the Sabaean capital have inscriptions showing their late first millennium BC reconstruction and expansion from earlier systems (Bowen 1958; Brunner 1997<italic>b</italic>; Gentelle 1998:89); expansion of such irrigation works also significantly enlarged the modest catchments of the desert oases in which they were founded (Hehmeyer 1991:37; Schiettecatte 2006:157, 484). Assyrian and later classical texts attest to the importance of caravan traffic in aromatics as a significant economic mainstay of South Arabian states (Hoyland 2001:39; Müller 1976) and an important source of wealth for the elites of lowland capitals. While fed with difficult-to-manage irrigation, these centers also managed the overland flow of camel caravans, which emerged as transport systems sometime after domestication of the dromedary. Ensuring the passage of goods through territories beyond the modest irrigated basins of the desert margin was a significant concern of the mature state, one met in part through pilgrimage. Temples and sacred precincts were dedicated to federal gods whose paramount status was reinforced not only through supplications of local inhabitants but also through tribute-bearing pilgrimages by confederated or vassal tribes who visited at prescribed times in a state of purity, bearing no weapons, and participated in ritual banquets sponsored by the elite residents of state capitals (Breton 1979; Ghul 1984; Maraqten 2008:241; Noja 1985; Robin 2000:158; Robin and Breton 1982; Sedov 2005). Pilgrimage to the shrines of local divinities is also well attested among the tribal confederates of Arabian states. Sabaean and Qatabānian royal interventions and authorizations in such pilgrimages appear in a number of inscriptions (Ghul 1984; Korotayev 2003; Obermayer 1999:51; Pirenne 1991) and are particularly evident in the inscriptional and archaeological evidence from a highland temple site (of the local deity) at Jabal al Lawdh (Robin and Breton 1982).</p>
         <p>Epigraphic and archaeological evidence also shows urban sponsorship of pilgrimage, which lay at the core of South Arabian state identity and was reinforced through the tithes and first fruits offered by tribal pilgrims and the sacrifices and ritual banquets performed by sedentary elites. The politically centralizing role of (<italic>mkrb</italic>) <italic>mukarrib</italic> was consolidated through authoritative resources as the sacrificer and determinant of where and when pilgrimage would be oriented. Additionally, it was the <italic>mukarrib</italic> who received tithes, which probably included frankincense and other resinous aromatics growing in highland Ḥaḍramawt (Ryckmans 1973<italic>b</italic>).</p>
         <p>Social differentiation and classes are also embedded in textual references to formal titles like <italic>mukarrib</italic>, king (<italic>mlk</italic>), and clan leader (<italic>qyl</italic>; Korotayev 1993<italic>b</italic>), and offices like sacrificer (<italic>rshwt</italic>; Pirenne 1972, 1976:183, 203), administrator (<italic>qyn</italic>), tithe gatherer (<italic>qzn</italic>; Beeston 1972:266), and community headman (<italic>kbr</italic>; Schiettecatte 2006:416). Specialized labor is also attested, as for example, the four-generation family of masons (<italic>grby</italic>) at Raybun (Frantsouzoff 2001). There remained a powerful adherence to kinship structures and metaphors of kinship as the basis for class membership in the (<italic>byt</italic>) <italic>bayt</italic> (house), a term whose meanings across time and communities could include members of a kin group (Korotayev 1993<italic>a</italic>; Robin 1984), members of a corporate landholding group (Beeston 1972), and members related through client status (Korotayev 1994<italic>a</italic>).</p>
         <p>The archaeological record provides a complementary picture of the Iron Age kingdoms but is also sparse in the second and early first millennia BC, leaving a notable chronological and cultural gap in material expression prior to the emergence of urban kingdoms, which has puzzled archaeologists expecting a sequence of developing social complexity marked by increasing evidence of wealth and economic specialization in the locations where states appeared. Archaeology shows that irrigation had begun as indigenous technologies in the highlands of southwest and south Arabia as early as 3200 BC (Harrower 2008<italic>b</italic>; Wilkinson 1999) and may have been quickly adapted to spread the spate-water floods of the desert margins across dry but otherwise arable land (Brunner and Haefner 1986; Francaviglia 2002). In the highland region of western Yemen, where agricultural crops are attested as early as the late fourth millennium BC, winter cereals and pulses from the Levantine area appeared first (Costantini 1990; Ekstrom and Edens 2003) as the outcome of new technologies (terracing, diversion flow) that held moisture from summer rainfall to grow winter crops (McCorriston 2006). The date palm oases critical to the settlement of interior and desert margins of Arabia seem to be a slightly later phenomenon (Cleuziou 2001) and one that produced no urban communities before the first millennium BC (Edens 1999; Mouton 2009). Nor did well-documented contacts with Mesopotamia and the Indus generate secondary Bronze Age states in Arabia (Cleuziou 2007). Bronze Age cultures from the middle third to early second millennia were differentiated one from another with highland, walled settlements supported by terraced agriculture in western Yemen (Edens 1999; Edens, Wilkinson, and Barratt 2000) and small communities of agro-pastoralists without walled settlements using different architecture and ceramics along the interior desert margins (De Maigret 1990; Edens 1999; Schiettecatte 2010:474). Surveys in the highlands of southern Yemen (McCorriston 2000, n.d.; McCorriston et al. 2011) and Dhufār (Zarins 2001) manifest similar traces of agro-pastoralists after about 2500 BC, but these sites lack ceramics, the midden accumulations, planned layout, and adjacent resources that would suggest permanent occupation or even numerous contemporaneous households. Where excavations and dating have provided chronological sequences, these show a gap after about 1800 BC (McCorriston et al. 2011; Zarins 2001) with only a few indications of human activity in the mid-upper reaches of major wadis that feed the lowland desert margin (McCorriston 2000; Sedov 1996<italic>a</italic>, 1996<italic>b</italic>, 1996<italic>c</italic>; Zimmerman 2008). No settlements have been found in connection with third millennium spate-water farming in the desert lowlands. Simple, rectilinear mud-brick architecture and painted ceramics in scant excavation soundings mark the earliest known (and widely separated) occupations in middle to late second millennium BC Ḥaḍramawt (Badre 1991; Breton et al. 2010:13–14; Darles 2008:146; Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>). During the second half of the second millennium BC, there existed a southwest Arabian Bronze Age coastal plain civilization with strong ties to pre-Aksumite African cultures (Buffa 2007; Edens 1999; Keall 1998; Vogt and Sedov 1998; Zarins and al-Badr 1986) but showing almost no cultural continuities with the South Arabian civilizations that immediately follow.</p>

         <title>Arabian Civilization Was Autochthonic</title>
         <p>Arguments that once attributed first millennium states to a migration from the north (Van Beek 1969:79–266; see also Höfner 1959; Knauf 1989; Robin 1982<italic>a</italic>; Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>) have now been largely abandoned (Avanzini 2009; Dostal 1989<italic>a</italic>, 1989<italic>b</italic>; Schiettecatte 2006, 2008; Wilkinson 2005). The original migration suggestion can be traced to multiple strands of reasoning, now controversial or discredited. First is the archaeological appearance of new ceramics (Van Beek 1969:79–266) unrelated to previous cultural groups, or (in Ḥaḍramawt) unprecedented by any ceramic tradition. Whereas similarities in decoration but not form suggested that these were most closely related to ceramics from the Levant (Sedov 1996<italic>a</italic>, 1996<italic>c</italic>; Van Beek 1969:356–359), further discoveries and analysis have shown a diversity of traditions (Edens 1999; Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>), including contemporary but unrelated ceramics at Sabir, reaching back to the thirteenth and even perhaps the fourteenth centuries BC (Buffa 2007). Moreover, archaeologists are today less ready to identify particular ceramic traditions with ethnically different people. The suggestion of an influential migration also owes something to history of research, for the first Iron Age excavations and limited evidence from Arabia were accomplished and interpreted by archaeologists fresh from Levantine and biblical backgrounds in which migration theories have a long role.</p>
         <p>Linguistic studies of naming (onomastics) have revealed a dominance of patronymic names with fewer matronymic clans in the Middle Sabaean state (Avanzini 1991, 2006; Korotayev 1993<italic>a</italic>, 1994<italic>a</italic>). The reasons for this are unclear, and explanations range across a number of possibilities, including a shift from cognitive to unilinear descent (Dostal 1989<italic>b</italic>) and an influx of patriarchal northern mobile peoples in the first quarter of the first millennium BC (Höfner 1959; Robin 1982<italic>a</italic>). In the case of South Arabia, many scholars have been consciously or not influenced by paradigms of historical anthropology in a perceived shift from early matriarchy to later patriarchy, a motif without firm substantiation but familiar since Morgan, Engels, Robertson-Smith, and other late nineteenth-century social historians (McCorriston 2011:70–71). In understanding the emergence of southern Arabian states, it is important to decouple ancient arguments about an original matriarchy and its replacement by patriarchy (Korotayev 1994<italic>a</italic>) from assumptions of population replacement. Shifts in descent and kinship narratives may equally stem from the socioeconomic changes introduced with sedentism, shifted dependence on farming (Dostal 1989<italic>b</italic>), and reallocated household labor (e.g., McCorriston 1997; Mitterauer 1992).</p>
         <p>Finally, in support of a northern migration, there is a link between the writing systems of southern Arabia and Semitic alphabets elsewhere prior to the thirteenth century BC (Ryckmans 1991:30). Nevertheless, this may not mean that Ancient South Arabian was derived from a northern Semitic language but that it was formed locally as a convergence of dialects (Avanzini 2009; see also Rubio 1999 for a similar argument for Sumerian, and Schiettecatte 2010 for cultural linkages across a broad western Arabian cultural sphere). Other cultural traits are indisputably local and remain highly influential, including pilgrimage and Arabian religion. Pilgrimage was not introduced to the bedouin from urban contexts, although this notion surely draws subtle inspiration from early Islamic (urban) writers despising (Central Arabian) bedouin ignorance in the early centuries of Islam (Atallah 1969). Instead, pilgrimage was a long-standing practice among mobile pastoral groups within southern Arabia (McCorriston 2011) and was a primary element in forging community ties. The South Arabian pantheon is also native, predates South Arabian civilization (Pirenne 1976), and attests to the strong role of local ideologies. The emergence and federalization of pilgrimage as a state function in the lowland agricultural basins draws upon indigenous Arabian practices by predominantly mobile agro-pastoralists whose archaeological traces have been generally slight and, until recently, less investigated than sedentary people’s.</p>

         <title>Arabia Followed a Different Path: Animal Domestication and Mobile Pastoralists Developed Antecedents to Complex Societies</title>
         <p>In an early synthesis of Arabian prehistory, Maurizio Tosi (1986) suggested that the long continuities in foraging-herding economies were an alternative to the materialistic rise of adjacent Old World civilizations. A compelling and comprehensive review of the South Arabian urbanization process concludes that long-term management of agricultural territories by small, agglomerative communities was the crucible in which administrative and social complexities were forged, greatly stimulated by the introduction of camel transport and caravan traffic (Schiettecatte 2006:399; see also Magee 2007). But these processes have left few archaeological remains in the core territories of nascent kingdoms. A few deep soundings under principal urban sites have produced evidence of irrigation, new ceramics, and new architectural technologies such as rectilinear mud-brick architecture in the middle to late second millennium BC (Badre 1991; Benoist et al. 2007; Breton et al. 2010; Darles 2008:145–146; Schiettecatte 2007), but much is left to inference from later records, and nascent complexity is but a speculation that agricultural settlements should be there, founded on materialist expectations. I argue that earlier and contemporary records from pre- and a-historic pastoralists contribute fundamentally to our understanding of the Arabian path to (late) formation of complex societies.</p>
         <p>The South Arabian kingdoms and earlier confederacies lay in a west to east crescent along the southern rim of the desert basin called Ramlāt As-Sabatayn, but there are very few indications of long histories of prior settlement, and there remains some disagreement concerning the extent or significance of the early traces that have been reported. The ancient capitals of Ma’rib (Saba’, Sheba), Timna’ (Qatabān), Hajar Yahirr in Wadi Markha, and Shabwa (Ḥaḍramawt) lie at the mouths of highland drainages where they open to the lowland desert interior. In summer months, perhaps only several times a year, and with great force, the runoff waters from entire highland catchments would provide critical moisture for irrigating date palms and cereal crops. The irrigation works developed to manage spate water were impressive, and at their zenith required organized oversight (Harrower 2009). Ma’rib has deep anthropogenic sediments that may have begun forming in the third millennium BC, but the dating evidence is relative and geomorphological, based on extrapolating an early date from first millennium BC radiocarbon dates and an assumed continuous and steady rate of sediment accumulation through uninterrupted irrigation (Francaviglia 2002; Herberg 1987; cf. Gentelle 1998:88). The founding date of the town is unknown, but the Ma’rib tell consists mostly of late mediaeval deposits with traces of early second millennium occupation (Eichmann and Hitgen 2003; Schiettecatte 2006:172). Sedimentation in the Wadi Markha is dated from extrapolation of underlying sedimentation rates from an early second millennium BC radiocarbon date on loose charcoal in sediment (Brunner <italic>a</italic>), and the question remains whether the age of the charcoal dates the age of its deposition. In excavation of tells in Wadi Bayhān (Qatabān), the high heights of wall preservation from ancient South Arabian civilization accounts for the height of tells; there is no accumulation from preceding settlement (Breton 1998:129). Earlier settlement and permanent agricultural occupation found in upstream drainages, which are easier to manage, have been attested but unfortunately not well-enough dated to close the chronological gap (Blakeley et al. 1985; Ghaleb 1990, 2005). In particular, there are no certain chronological and cultural in situ continuities with the first Sabaean settlements (Edens 1999). If prestate settlements existed at the desert margins, they would be buried under accumulated anthropogenic sediments where people practiced spate-water farming for several successive millennia.</p>
         <p>Extensive geomorphological, sedimentological, and archaeological analysis of such sedimentary sequences have studied erosional cut banks and sections to provide chronologies and indicators of human and natural processes in their formation. In more than 60 years of intensive investigation, no buried villages, houses, floors, or walls have been reported (e.g., Schiettecatte 2006:184; cf. at Hajar Yahirr, Brunner 1997<italic>a</italic>, 1997<italic>b</italic>). On the other hand, there are reasonably common discoveries of temporary settlement in the numerous hearths and even human-set fires found in natural sedimentary sections (e.g, Inizan and Ortlieb 1987; McCorriston et al. 2002, 2005). If these slight remains of mobile foragers and pastoralists can be found, then also should appear permanent occupations of villages and increasingly complex settled communities with special function architecture, such as granaries and big houses, had they once existed. These have not been found; the archaeological record shows no development of irrigation, agriculture, and settlement alongside emerging social classes manifested by architectural differences, settlement sizes, systems, or layouts, storage, wealth, differentiation of labor, or administration as in states constituted through agricultural production (cf. Bernbeck 1995; McCorriston 1997; Stein 1994). While such remains may yet come to light, an alternative hypothesis suggests that other factors may be important.</p>
         <p>The introduction of domesticated camels was surely important for the development of caravan trade, but invoking camel transport shifts emphasis on exchange rather than production of a surplus to facilitate that exchange. It was not the influence of first millennium BC caravan traffic that sparked complexity in southern Arabia. It is apparent that the South Arabian kingdoms were already developed by the time Assyrian demands for luxury goods in the seventh century led to direct contact between Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and one <italic>mukarrib</italic>, “Karibilu king of Sheba” (Eph’al 1982:123), generally understood to be the seventh century BC Kar’ib Il Watar, son of Dhamar’ali (Lemaire 1996:38), who led an already developed confederacy to hegemony over its neighbors (Hoyland 2001:39; Robin 1996). The prized commodity linking southern Arabian caravans with northern states was aromatic resins, most notably frankincense, which grew nowhere in the lowland kingdoms, nor in the long-settled highlands of north Yemen, but in the southern Yemen and Dhufār highlands lacking late second and first millennia settlements (Groom 1981; fig. 1). These were the regions in which pastoralist groups maintained significant mobility, and the production of incense and its passage to irrigated oases took place within their territories. Aromatics exchange, carried on donkeys, was already important in the Bronze Age and even Neolithic (Lawler 2010; Zarins 1997, 2001). Moreover, vigorous trade in aromatics, copper, and other resources did not result in formation of complex societies and emergence of states in Bronze Age Arabia, which held to its tribal traditions (Cleuziou 2007). To account for the emergence of social complexity attendant on emerging systems of labor specialization, surplus, and exchange that culminated in oasis centers wealthy from caravan traffic, one must account for frankincense production in the highlands.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>Clues to this production and its transport to the lowlands lie in the social dynamics of largely mobile, forager-pastoral peoples who left few archaeological traces but whose socially constituting mechanisms relying on nonmaterial variables of group solidarity and authoritative resources stretch back long before small farming settlements in Ḥaḍramawt. Lack of houses and settlement does not imply that people were absent, and monuments, shelters, and water management structures attest their presence in Ḥaḍramawt, the kingdom nearest to the source of frankincense. Whatever the environmental-material underpinnings of an increased economic emphasis on farming and settlement in Arabian lowland oases of the late second and early first millennium BC, it is clear that the social practices that established and reified group identities, including the integration of tribal groups into a federated complex society, were deeply embedded in the preexisting practices of mobile Arabian pastoralists.

         <title>The Archaeological Sequence in Ḥaḍramawt</title>
         <p>This paper summarizes the important example of pre-kingdom archaeological remains in Ḥaḍramawt, which shows scant evidence for any second millennium BC settlement. Two major centers, Raybun and the Ḥaḍramawt capital Shabwa, have been extensively excavated over 30 years. At Shabwa, the earliest, if slightly documented, occupation dates to the middle second millennium (Badre 1991; Breton et al. 2010). Otherwise, the major architecture, including walls, palace, and temple, can be traced from the tenth to the sixth centuries BC (Darles 2008:145–146). Raybun was founded on virgin soil no earlier than the thirteenth century BC. From the very founding of the site appeared rectilinear mud-brick houses, burnished red-slipped and red-painted pottery without local precedent, and the stone foundations of what later became an important temple (Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>).</p>
         <p>The French Archaeological Mission in Ḥaḍramawt has probed the chronological and regional context of settlement at Makaynūn, a walled center in the eastern interior (Wadi Masilah) of Wadi Ḥaḍramawt and closely flanked by northern and southern highlands. Like other sites, an impressive stone wall appeared in around the first millennium, with traces of earlier (mud-brick) occupation. A natural stream channel may have provided small-scale local agricultural potential, but it dried prior to the founding of the city walls and the man-made irrigation canals in the early first millennium BC (Benoist et al. 2007; Schiettecatte 2007).</p>
         <p>Surveys in Ḥaḍramawt have shown that sites with early ceramics were situated upstream (Sedov 1996<italic>a</italic>, 1996<italic>b</italic>, 1996<italic>c</italic>; Zimmerman 2008). Likewise, irrigation technology also first appeared in the highlands. As in the western Yemen highlands (Wilkinson 1999, 2003), irrigation technology appeared at the end of the fourth millennium BC (Harrower 2008<italic>b</italic>) in the gentle second- and third-order streams where spate-water flow was easier to control and could be managed at a smaller scale by mobile pastoralists who left no settlement traces (McCorriston 2006; McCorriston et al. 2005, 2011). It is significant that these canal and check dam technologies of Wadi Sana were independently invented and differed from contemporary terracing in highland western Yemen and oasis management in Oman (Cleuziou 1997; Wilkinson 1999, 2003), suggesting a local highland origin and subsequent development of the irrigation systems that supported Arabian complex societies. But there are no nearby traces of settlement, suggesting that it was the mobile and manifestly pastoral people already in the highlands (Crassard et al. 2006; Martin, McCorriston, and Crassard 2009; McCorriston and Martin 2009) who developed irrigation and practiced the first agriculture in Ḥaḍramawt (Harrower 2008<italic>b</italic>).</p>
         <p>The earliest dated house structures in Ḥaḍramawt are widely spaced alignments of circular stone houses at Shi‘b Munaydar. The site lies on rocky slopes along the upstream edges of Wadi Idim, at the foot of the highlands and overlooking springs (McCorriston 2000; McCorriston et al. 2002:68, 79–80). Limited excavation has so far yielded only one radiocarbon date on a hearth over bedrock. Calibrated to 1520–1407 BC, it dates an occupation of houses placed among and adjacent to third millennium BC tombs (McCorriston 2000). If the inhabitants practiced irrigation, they left no obvious storage technologies, no differentiated house sizes and layouts, and no special function architecture like granaries. The Shi‘b Munaydar settlement could actually be older than second millennium BC, for the local springs had already dried up, there is no sign that tombs were dismantled to furnish stone for houses, and a late fourth millennium BC rural sanctuary without adjacent dwellings lies just downstream at Rawk (Steimer-Herbet et al. 2007<italic>a</italic>, 2007<italic>b</italic>). Whatever is the date for building stone houses, there is no evidence for agricultural use of the springs. Modern inhabitants still can practice small-scale runoff farming (a field here or there) using modest and unpredictable flow from tiny, local catchments, as in third millennium Wadi Sana (Harrower 2008<italic>a</italic>). Available evidence suggests that Shi‘b Munaydar was a Bronze Age site occupied seasonally to keep pastoral flocks near to winter pasture, with at least one house reoccupied by mobile herders in the middle second millennium BC.</p>
         <p>Systematic investigations downstream in Wadi Idim, in Wadi Daw’an, and in Wadi Ḥaḍramawt–Wadi Masilah itself find no evidence for settlement earlier than the last centuries of the second millennium BC by the “ancient Wadi Ḥaḍramawt culture” (Sedov 1996<italic>c</italic>:86; Zimmerman 2008) with its burnished red-slipped and red-painted pottery and mud-brick architecture. The earliest such sites are thought to occupy the edges of the wadi but later moved downslope and downstream to occupy the center of the natural alluvium that forms the lowest terrace (Sedov 1996<italic>a</italic>, 1996<italic>b</italic>, 1996<italic>c</italic>:80). This latter move, if confirmed by future excavations and dating, may show a growing confidence in farmers’ abilities to control the stronger spate waters downstream and also a deepened commitment to agriculture and cooperative agricultural land and water use in larger groups, at the same time prioritizing farming over the ready access to upland seasonal pasture lands, more readily accessed from upstream locations. The new style of ceramics continues to suggest influx from elsewhere, but one need look no further than coastal Sabir for mud-brick antecedents, rectilinear building plans, and second millennium BC irrigation canals (Vogt and Sedov 1998).</p>
         <p>Mobile pastoralists were part of Ḥaḍramawt’s landscape from earliest times. Archaeological evidence for domesticated animals and pastoralism is generally poor both because archaeologists have preferred to excavate materially rich settlements and because there are few sediments to preserve faunal remains in rocky terrain. Nevertheless, faunal remains of cattle, sheep, and goats show that domesticated animals have played a major role in the socioeconomic structure of mobile people since the Neolithic (Cleuziou and Tosi 1997; Fedele 2008; McCorriston and Martin 2009; McCorriston et al. 2012), and a pan-Arabian rock art corpus shows increasing representation of domesticated animals over time in areas never farmed (Anati 1972, 1974; Khan 1993; Rachad 2007). Further evidence linking the rock art representation of domesticated animals to mobile pastoral groups comes from <italic>wusum</italic>, distinctive tribal brands found in discrete territories in rock art and still used on herded animals today (Khan 2000). Rock art is notoriously difficult to date, but the majority appears to have been created after 5,000 years ago (Khan 1993; Newton and Zarins 2000:155–161). In Ḥaḍramawt’s southern highlands, several rock shelters have yielded radiocarbon dates on charred mats of caprine dung pellets (AA60240, 4048–3804 BC; AA60243, 4229–3802 BC; OS16958, 3621–3118 BC; OS18691, 3702–3398 BC), the residue of sheep and goat herders who fired old campsites to clean them for new use, as is practiced by herders in the region today. Many rock shelters show signs of later use, including graffiti showing camels, Old South Arabian script, and surface remains of campsites of indeterminate date. Climate-driven change in environmental conditions, including a shift from depositional to erosional flow in highland drainages (Harrower, Oches, and McCorriston 2012; Lézine et al. 2010) made the stratified preservation of mobile camps less likely after 3,000 BC, so it is difficult to date the archaeological (surface) remains of mobile peoples who were surely present during the third to first millennia.</p>
         <p>The most obvious material remains of pastoralists and their socially constituting practices throughout prehistory in southern Arabia are small-scale stone monuments (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; Braemer et al. 2001; McCorriston 2011; McCorriston et al. 2011, 2012) linked to rock art and mobile pastoralists of the Bronze Age third to second millennia BC (Newton and Zarins 2000). Small-scale monuments (further discussed below) include the tombs and probable cenotaphs of some distinctive individuals; not everyone was buried in a tomb because the numbers of tombs and monuments can hardly account for all tribespeople over several millennia. Monuments served as important mnemonic devices to archive oral information across the broad temporal and spacial ruptures of mobile, segmented societies (Connerton 1989; McCorriston et al., in press; Van Dycke and Alcock 2003). As such, small-scale monuments played an important and enduring role in preserving authoritative resources used in organizing and maintaining a large social collectivity for resource defense (McCorriston et al. 2012) or other economic purposes.</p>
         <p>One such purpose for Arabian kingdoms was the collection of frankincense. Since frankincense had to be collected and transported from the territories of mobile people, presumably pastoralists, it was necessary to anchor these groups into larger social communities to facilitate transport to the northward caravans. At lowland oases, sanctuaries and pilgrimage centers were constructed through the persuasion of local leaders, also probably those involved in organizing agricultural construction and water allocation. Confederation of territorial tribes (whether settled or not; e.g., Obermeyer 1999; Wilkinson 2005) into political and economic entities relied on pilgrimage practices. Indeed, rather isolated sites of second millennium rectilinear architecture and painted ceramics may represent as-yet archaeologically ill-defined gathering places for mobile, largely pastoral people where practices of social constitution—such as pilgrimage and feasting—intermittently took place. This interpretation lies within a long Arabian tradition of social constitution (McCorriston 2011) and links mobile pastoralists, their charismatic leaders, and the formation of kingdoms through the settlement of mobile groups, a theme resonant in Ibn Khaldūn’s theory of history.</p>

         <title>Ibn Khaldūn’s Theory of State Formation</title>
         <sec id="sc5.1">
            <title>Ibn Khaldūn in History</title>
            <p>‘Abdar-Raḥmān Abu Zayd ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad Ibn Khaldūn (d. 1406) lived in the middle-late fourteenth century AD while Europe struggled through the high Middle Ages, Inquisition, dogma, and orthodoxy. Five centuries before Marx and historical materialism, Ibn Khaldūn crafted an entirely independent universal theory of history, for centuries untranslated from the original Arabic and ignored in the Western canon. Ibn Khaldūn’s intellect was fostered through his life as a scholarly elite. Born of an Arab Hadrami family, Ibn Khaldūn’s immediate ancestors went to Iberia with the Ummayyid dynasty and thence migrated to North Africa in the twelfth century. Ibn Khaldūn himself was tutored in Qur’an, Hadith, and jurisprudence, the highest sources of knowledge in the Islamic world and based on divine revelation and precedence. He also studied Arabic poetry and grammar and thereby exercised an analytical, comparative, and rational epistemological approach. His learning qualified him for judgeships, counselorships, and the patronage of rulers wherever he traveled, like his well-known, near contemporary, Ibn Battuta. Ibn Khaldūn served as a court functionary for a Merinid Sultan at Fez, and he thereby became engaged in the warring dynastic struggles of North African states. At one point he was imprisoned under suspicion of collusion, freed, raised desert Arab armies in support of the rulers, then was employed by yet another sultan to pacify the tribes. Finally, he was sheltered under tribal protection and took the 3-year opportunity to write his <italic>Muqaddimah</italic> (Introduction) to his <italic>Kitāb al-Ibār</italic> (Book of universal history; Dawood, in Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:vii–ix; see also Cheddadi 2006:20–30).</p>
            <p>In many ways the <italic>Muqaddimah</italic> is the outcome of his experience with warring North African petty states of the fourteenth century, but it is Ibn Khaldūn’s genius that transforms this experience from particular chronicle to a general philosophy of the appearance and dissolution of civilizations. Foremost concern for a medieval Muslim like Ibn Khaldūn was the decay of the unified Islamic caliphate—highly evident in his experience of the beginning Christian Reconquista in Iberia and the petty fragmentation of Muslim principalities. In writing a universal history, Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:120–121) grappled with the philosophical issues of the history of the Arabs. How was it that the Arabs, to whom Allah revealed Qur’an through the Prophet Muhammad, had lost rulership of the Islamic empire?</p>
            <p>Ibn Khaldūn wrote a consciously Islamic philosophy, incorporating Islamic assumptions and ideas such as the notion of original grace (<italic>khalāq</italic>, createdness) as the inherent human condition rather than a Christian belief about humanity as inheritors of original sin. This has significant repercussions for anthropology. For Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:92), bedouins living in harsh desert conditions “adopt the natural manner of making a living, namely … they do not possess conveniences and luxuries” and were, therefore,<disp-quote>
                  <p>closer to the first natural state and more remote from the evil habits that have been impressed upon the souls [of sedentary people] through numerous and ugly, blameworthy customs. … Sedentary life constitutes the last stage of civilization and the point where it begins to decay. It also constitutes the last stage of evil and of remoteness from goodness. Clearly the bedouins are closer to being good than sedentary people. (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:94)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>This is an important point of departure in adapting an alternative archaeological approach to the rise of civilization—also known as the development of complexity—from Ibn Khaldūn’s non-Western theory. Western approaches have long labored under the (biblical) burden of Eurocentric histories that place civilization, first European but later any civilization, at the end and apogee of historical development, deriving progressive complexity from lesser, simple, even primitive, beginnings (Childe 1950 [1942], 1951 [1936]; Morgan 1877; Sahlins and Service 1960; Sanders and Price 1968; cf. Yoffee 2005). A biblical eviction from Eden and meritorious labor through agriculture before acquiring the grace of civilization has no place in Ibn Khaldūn’s fundamental worldview. Instead, bedouin solidarity is pitted in dynamic and cyclic opposition to socially dissolute sedentary life.</p>
            <p>Although Ibn Khaldūn drew explicit inspiration from Aristotle’s cyclical framework of political economy (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:41; Mahdi 1964:32–33), his <italic>Muqaddimah</italic> to a universal history was a revolutionary approach in conceptualizing history as a process that could be explained in theoretical terms, and it breaks from his predecessors and contemporaries in this respect. It is significant today as an alternative to the Western canon emphasizing simple developing into complex (with less attention to dissolution and reversal of complexities) and offers a significant new avenue for archaeological inquiry into long-standing problems of social evolution and the emergence of civilizations.</p>
            <p>These problems have long been cast in a Childean materialist model of the Neolithic and Urban Revolutions, inherited in part from the linear and deeply flawed social progressivism of Lewis Henry Morgan (McCorriston 2009, 2011). Cultural evolutionists have transformed the materialist assumptions inherent in Childe’s framework into population and resource dynamics that underpin transformations in social form, generating thereby the familiar typologies of bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states (Sahlins and Service 1960; Service 1975; Steward 1972 [1955]; White 1949). While many archaeologists studying emergent complexity and archaic states have shifted their focus from chiefdoms to the flow of power, prestige, and wealth in transforming political economies (D’Altroy and Hastorf 2001; Feinman and Marcus 1998; Stein 2004; Yoffee 2005), there still exists an inherent linearity from simple to complex and a fundamental reliance on the material advantages of surplus and control of staple and wealth surplus in the emergence of hereditary leadership and class. Under these assumptions, archaeological indicators of wealth would accompany the emergence of hereditary leadership. Anthony Giddens (1984:261–265) usefully differentiated such material allocative resources from authoritative ones (see below) but also argued that both can be stored in physical repositories (ergo, material correlates of social behavior) that aid in perpetuating long-term social frameworks.</p>

            <title>The Bayt-State Theory</title>
            <p>Ibn Khaldūn’s starting point and worldview looks quite different. He suggested a fundamental dichotomy between existence in the <italic>bādiyah</italic> (desert, barren places) and <italic>hadārah</italic> (settled civilizations) while conceiving a historical process through which bedouins (occupants of <italic>bādiyah</italic>) and civilized folk were transformed into the other. Within the process of beginning settled life lay the seeds of its dissolution, and the transformation of bedouin into sedentary people necessarily brought them farther from their natural disposition (grace) and to the “last stage of civilization and the point where it begins to decay” (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:94). (Four centuries later Jean-Jacques Rousseau agreed essentially with Ibn Khaldūn’s perspective on the primitive, and it was Rousseau’s philosophy that gave to Western science and anthropology the concept of the Noble Savage; Rousseau 1941, 1972). Thus the bedouins and their way of life are the basis for sedentary life and cities.</p>
            <p>The sentiment that bedouin life held great virtue was not exclusive to Ibn Khaldūn’s time but reflected a long-standing ideology among Arabs. Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, some of which was composed by sedentary people like the Kinda prince Imr al-Qays from Ḥajrayn, extols the virtues of desert life (Hitti 1961 [1937]:95).<sup>1</sup> Biographies of the Prophet Muhammad describe how his mother fostered him with a nomadic tribeswoman as was the habit of the time (Ibn Hisham [d. 218] 1955:70–71). Fostering an infant removed it from the diseases that plagued urban areas and also plausibly introduced the values of bedouin life. Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:95–98) described these values as fortitude, independence, self-reliance, courage, and above all, strong social ties or group feeling (<italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>). Under Ibn Khaldūn’s theory, hereditary leadership would emerge without significant wealth. In Giddens’s (1984:162) terminology, knowledge of a genealogy that confers close kin ties and fosters social solidarity is an authoritative resource.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>‘Aṣabīyah</italic> lies at the heart of Ibn Khaldūn’s historical process, from which I will extract the <italic>bayt</italic>-state theory. <italic>‘Aṣabīyah</italic> is the foundation of political authority (<italic>mulk</italic>) and can be inculcated through charismatic leadership, especially of prophets, whose success as a mark of God’s favor can be attributed to <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>. History shows that the loss of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> means the loss of royal authority (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:107, 124–125). As the means of both political ascendancy and dissolution, <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> receives close consideration in the dynamic tension and cycling between leadership of bedouin and settled life. As explained in greater detail below, the terminological choice of <italic>bayt</italic>-state to name Ibn Khaldūn’s theory of state formation uses indigenous concepts of <italic>bayt</italic> common to both bedouin and settled communities in southern Arabia. <italic>Bayt</italic> has contextually variable connotations as kinship group, territory, symbolic icon (tomb, tent, standing stone), and corporate landholding group (Beeston 1972, 1979; Bujra 1971; Chelhod 1984; Hartley 1961; Korotayev 1994<italic>b</italic>; Lammens 1919:60–84, 91; Pirenne 1976:191–192, 204) and served as metaphorical anchor in state formation as kinship-based communities were transformed into class-based societies.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>‘Aṣabīyah</italic> stems from, above all, close blood relations as a natural (i.e., conferred by God) human disposition, but while emphasizing the significance of biological relatedness, Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:98) recognizes kinship relations and the idiom of biological kinship as powerful stimulants for group feeling. Ethnic identity stems from kinship relations and itself nurtures <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, as do the close relations of clientship and alliances, especially when expressed “exactly or in approximately the same way as does common descent” resulting in idiomatic kinship.</p>
            <p>Just as several circumstances—blood relations, or all social contacts framed in the metaphor of blood relations, or unifying around charismatic leadership (e.g., prophets)—strengthen <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, so can circumstances limit it. For example, as numbers increase and territories grow in size, group feeling is attenuated (Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:128). This can also happen through loss of purity of lineage, as kin are “swallowed up by other nations” (Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:99, 109, 141). Environmental conditions foster <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>: Ibn Khaldūn is very clear in his assertion that the harsh conditions of desert life and the restricted material goods—luxuries, conveniences, foods—encourage the human qualities among the bedouin that make stronger social ties, including persuasive leadership to restrain and repel aggression. Conversely, the luxuries and material goods of sedentary life weaken group feeling. Wealth, appropriated by the powerful and desired by the weak, as is inherent human nature, in effect creates classes, which weaken <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> (Ibn Khaldūn (1967 [1377]:135–138). Ibn Khaldūn also noted such patterns with the creation of client relationships (through material wealth) to keep kin at bay (1967 [1377]:146).</p>
            <p>Ibn Khaldūn was also specific in attributing the rise and fall of states to dynamics in <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> as it is linked to power. Since man’s nature is to be mutually aggressive, leaders who can curb that nature through either respect or force acquire authority. The persuasive nature of particular individuals, who can restrain the aggression of men upon other men through strengthening group feeling, leads to an increased following. As one’s following increases, so group feeling embraces clients and associates no longer related by blood, but the leader, able to command authority, will eventually find himself able to command force, abetted by strong group feeling among his followers (Cheddadi 2006:299; Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:107–109, 246).</p>
            <p>Dynasties follow a four-stage cycle from the rise of royal authority built upon mighty <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> “with its expression in soldiers and upon money, which supports the soldiers” (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:246) through the dissolution of group feeling, replaced by humiliation, envy, persecution of kin, isolation, and dissolution. Once “senility takes hold of the ruling dynasty and fiscal structures are disintegrating” (Ibn Khaldūn 1967 [1377]:254), a new leadership with “desert attitude” will seize power, with the old dynasty (i.e., state personified by its rulers) reduced to its former <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> built on (much attenuated) blood ties alone.</p>
            <p>Nascent dynasties appropriated the trappings of civilization—in other words, the material shell of a state. In the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldūn had no experience with modern nation-states built along the principles of common constituency across groups of class, gender, ethnicity, and religion (Kertzer 1988). Instead, his theory is induced from a history of Islamic states, in which royal authority derived ultimately from the Prophet passed to non-Arab dynasties, whose principle of rule over nonconstituents (some of whom were non-Muslims) was an uncontested fact of life. In many respects, Ibn Khaldūn’s medieval perspective on what constitutes a state is much more appropriate for prehistory and archaic states than the nation model. In Ibn Khaldūn’s view, royal authority means ruling by force, a force sustained by group feeling. Success at federalizing group feeling among groups unrelated by blood or kinship provides the necessary manpower for coercive force.</p>

            <title>Archaeology and <italic>‘Aṣabīyah</italic>
            </title>
            <p>In some ways, Ibn Khaldūn’s theory pleads for an Arabian archaeological application. With its recognition of both tensions and cyclic dynamics between <italic>bādiyah</italic> and <italic>hadārah</italic>, the theory resolves an unfortunate and inherent Western tendency to view the tribes of the desert as diametric opposites to sedentary life and civilization, a historical prejudice inherent in millennia of Orientalism (Said 1979). Roman historical sources depicted “Saracens” as dangerous (Parker 1987), despite the mutualistic economic relationships that bind pastoral and agricultural producers into a single society throughout much of Arabian history (Banning 1996; Lancaster and Lancaster 1999<italic>a</italic>, 1999<italic>b</italic>). Relying on Western sources provides little insight into the sophistication of Saracens (e.g., Nabataean Petra, Palmyra) or the disaffection and motives of Saracens militarily excluded or overrun by Romans. Ottoman, British, and French administrators learned to fear the strength of disaffected mobile Arab groups, whose group interests rarely aligned with those of imperial occupying forces. Not incidentally, the linear progressivism built into colonialist doctrines that justified the supremacy of Western civilization portrays tribes and mobile groups as inferior and less developed. Recent scholarship explodes this notion in the ancient world, and it is increasingly clear that several powerful Bronze Age and Iron Age states were constituted through the social frameworks—especially lineage narratives—that sustained their largely pastoral, highly mobile ancestral forebears (e.g., Castel and Peltenburg 2007; Porter 2002, 2009; Schwartz et al. 2003; Stein 2004; Turchin 2009).</p>
            <p>If Ibn Khaldūn’s model resolves the spurious split between desert and sown, a greater problem in its archaeological application is that <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> itself is behavioral not material. Ibn Khaldūn’s model has been applied to ethnographically and historically documented tribal dynamics both explicitly (Barfield 1990; Kostiner 1984) and implicitly (Caton 1990:94–96; Dresch 1990; Gellner 1969; Tapper 1990:60), but the archaeological record does not afford direct observation of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>. Archaeological application of Ibn Khaldūn’s theory therefore requires material correlates for <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, which the <italic>bayt</italic>-state theory emphatically suggests is antithetical to lavish material culture and inversely correlated with a rich material record of settled life. One might assume that societies rich in luxury goods such as the inhabitants of South Arabian urban centers with large and costly housing, refined public inscriptions, elaborate metalwork, alabaster statuary, and imported linen clothing would have diminished <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> because of the inverse relationship between <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> and wealth. But even if this were a tenable inference, albeit not a quantifiable one, it would be methodologically spurious to correlate a scant material culture (absence of evidence) with a stronger <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>. There are few remains and no settlements in most regions of Arabia during Iron Age (ca. 1000 BC-300 AD) civilizations, but the reasons may include poor archaeological preservation and mobility of pastoral groups, and <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> surely varied in time and place. The challenge therefore is to identify signs of strengthened and weakened <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> in the material record.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, the keys to this problem lie within an emerging archaeological culture history and landscape archaeology of settlement and mobility in the southern Arabian highlands. In western Yemen’s Dhamār plateau, agrarian settlements maintained economic ties to Bronze Age mobile pastoral groups using the drying marshes of the highlands (Wilkinson 2003) and escarpment (Khalidi 2006) and perhaps also with Khawlān, the arid grazing lands overlooking the desert interior (De Maigret 1990; Edens 1999; Edens, Wilkinson, and Barratt 2000). These relationships were to formalize in the highland-lowland alliances of later Arabian states (Korotayev, Klimenko, and Proussakov 1999; Obermeyer 1999). In Ḥaḍramawt, no significant Bronze Age settlement has been found, although sanctuaries and iconography there indicate a cultural continuity with Khawlān pastoral groups (Steimer-Herbet et al. 2007<italic>a</italic>, 2007<italic>b</italic>). By the Iron Age, settlements at Makaynūn, Raybun, and Shabwa consolidated surrounding territories (Benoist et al. 2007; Mouton et al. 2006:235; Schiettecatte 2006:394–400; Sedov 2003), even as monument building, and monument reuse in maintenance and claim of group territories (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; McCorriston et al. 2011) increased in the adjacent highlands of the southern plateau. These newly available archaeological records of monuments suggest strengthened <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> among nonsedentary pastoral groups as a formative platform upon which tribal federations and ultimately Arabian states were built.</p>

            <title>New Evidence</title>
            <p>Extensive survey and testing of monuments in Ḥaḍramawt and elsewhere in southern and southeastern Arabia reveal an intense and widely documented episode of tomb building, interment, and reburial during the late fourth to early second millennium BC (e.g., Braemer et al. 2001; Cleuziou 2007, 2001, 1997; Potts 1990:62–191; Steimer-Herbet 1999, 2004; Vogt 1997), eras that will not be further discussed here. In the subsequent second millennium BC, archaeological remains, including tombs, are curiously and comparatively scant, but a second episode of small-scale commemorative monument building and reuse took place from about 900 BC–500 AD, with its greatest intensity in southern Ḥaḍramawt between 400 BC and 100 AD.</p>
            <p>In the southern uplifted plateau of Ḥaḍramawt, 16 new radiocarbon dates (from a series of 30 new dates on archaeological structures) point to a variety of activities at tombs and small-scale stone monuments in this period (McCorriston et al. 2011; see table 2, fig. 2). The high circular tombs (HCT) of the Bronze Age show no sign of reuse in the early second millennium BC, during which time other interment styles (e.g., wall tombs, tumuli with stelae) were used. These later styles are far less numerous, suggesting that the number of people meriting elaborate mortuary treatment were fewer in the second millennium. High circular tombs were reused for new human interments from about 900 BC (AA83498, 1054–810 BC; AA83500, 221–411 AD). In one case (AA79762, 70 BC-234 AD; AA83496, 417–582 AD), a preexisting high circular tomb was used to sacrifice a camel in the widely discussed pre-Islamic practice of <italic>al-balīyah</italic>, which entails leaving a living mount bound at the tomb of an honored man (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; King 2009; Uerpmann 1999; Vogt 1994). Also important at this time are the repetitive finds of charcoal and thermally altered rocks atop and within high circular tombs. Excavation and sieving of a number of high circular tombs has established that the sedimentary deposits around human remains were eolian in origin. Bodies were interred uncovered on the ground in a rock chamber that readily trapped windblown dust accumulations that reach about a meter depth. Large charcoal fragments and fired rock in localized concentrations came from human activities at the tombs, always stratigraphically overlying burials and originating on the chamber roof or high within it, after eolian sediment had accumulated. Some of these concentrations have been dated to the first millennium BC (AA81818, 779–417 BC; AA81817, 766–415 BC; AA79767, 396–119 BC). From concentrations of fire-related materials, the eolian nature of the matrix, and stratigraphic sequences, excavators have ruled out secondary deposition of charcoal and thermally altered rock through human dumping of occupation sediments as tomb matrix; there are, moreover, no candidate sites or sources of sediment near these remote tombs built on bedrock. There are a number of high circular tombs that have faunal remains—a limb or mandible or cranial element of sheep or goat but not the entire animal—in upper sediments. This evidence points to in situ deposition of the remains of fires and food as revisitation of existing burial sites.<table-wrap id="tb2" position="float">

            <p>These visits represent events whose purposes, other than new burial, are difficult to ascertain. There were no first millennium settlements near the high circular tombs and one tumulus reported here; thus, there were no permanent residents. Settlement of any kind is very limited in prehistory of the southern plateau (Braemer et al. 2003; McCorriston 2000; McCorriston et al. 2005; Vogt and Sedov 1997, n.d.). If the remains were merely the detritus of passing nomads sheltering a cooking or warming fire from the wind, then one might expect a wider chronological distribution of charcoal fragments from the Bronze Age to the present. There have been mobile pastoralists continuously in the southern plateau, and to the present day they camped repeatedly in rock shelters close to the wadi bed, lower in elevation than the plateau and terraces where tombs were situated (McCorriston 2006; McCorriston et al. 2002). The high circular tomb interiors are cramped spaces, and although they could shelter a fire, they are built on high locations, exposed and far from pasturage and shelter for herds. Furthermore, burning traces observed on in situ construction suggest that fires were set on top of them, not within. It is likely that collapse and rockfall brought charcoal and thermally altered rock into the tomb chambers.</p>
            <p>Other studies of high circular tombs throughout the Arabian peninsula suggest that a pattern of revisitation in the first millennium BC was not limited to Ḥaḍramawt. A pipeline survey in Shabwa province (western Ḥaḍramawt) showed that high circular tombs were constructed in the third millennium BC and reused for burial in the first millennium BC (Crassard et al. 2010), a practice also likely in the environs of Ma’rib (Breton 1999:26; De Maigret and Antonini 2005). The nature of these revisits may have been simply a renewal of ancient burial practices (Crassard et al. 2010:176) inexplicably lapsed during the second millennium BC, or, as elaborated below, these revisits may represent a new appropriation of ancestors and the corporate tribal groups they anchored through physical placement of the recent dead at long-extant tombs. In this case, material remains and the remains of activities detected at them serve as physical markers for <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> among mobile peoples with little other material culture in the first millennium BC.</p>
            <p>A final component of Ibn Khaldūn’s theory offers important advantages in an archaeological application. Ibn Khaldūn relied on the role of charismatic prophets (e.g., the <italic>kāhīn</italic> of pre-Islamic times, and of course the Prophet Muhammad) as historical phenomena channeling <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>. Indeed, it is said that the relationship between the wise man, law, and community is the most important contribution of Ibn Khaldūn’s social thought (Mahdi 1964:56). Particularly in prehistory, coarse chronological resolution of the archaeological record seldom identifies individuals or individual lives (Binford 1962, 1965; Kolb 1997), but the historical and theoretical significance of agency has long been recognized, even as it remains elusive in material terms (Bourdieu 1977 [1972]; Brumfiel 1992; Brumfiel and Fox 1994; Giddens 1984; Joyce et al. 2004). As anthropologists increasingly emphasize the flow of power, prestige, and wealth in the formative chronologies of emergent hierarchies, a <italic>bayt</italic>-state model that explicitly recognizes historical agents within a structural framework aligns well with an anthropology that emphasizes the agency of individuals. In the Arabian case, some of these individuals appear historically with the first inscriptions extolling the military consolidations, building walls and agricultural works by <italic>mukarribs</italic>. There were surely leaders before <italic>mukarribs</italic> who, along with their predecessors, were disposed within an existing social world. Individual agency is notoriously difficult to identify in prehistoric archaeological records, yet the archaeological record of Ḥaḍramawt contains some clues. Using the iconography of anthropomorphic stelae (Newton and Zarins 2000) and Arabian ethnohistory, I have argued that the limited number of tumuli with stelae represent the interments of subsequently apotheosized tribal leaders from the middle third to middle second millennia BC, to whose tombs tribesmen returned in pilgrimage (McCorriston 2012; McCorriston et al. 2011:15–16). So-called warrior burials of single individuals buried with bronze weapons (like those depicted on tumuli with stelae) have been linked to emergent political status across the broader Near East (Newton and Zarins 2000; Philip 1995:153). I have argued elsewhere (and elaborate below) that pilgrimage is a meta-structural, socially constituting phenomenon that persists throughout massive economic, social, and political change in Arabian prehistory, and thus the agency of charismatic individuals is socialized and embedded within pilgrimage societies that shape their dispositions (McCorriston 2011).</p>

         <p>1. The social foundations for Arabian states are grounded in the societies and social relationships of Arabia’s indigenous pastoral groups, whose shared hardships and scant material wealth (apart from animals) was linked to their mobility in arid environments. The argument that pilgrimage is strongly associated with Arabian mobile groups is elaborated elsewhere (McCorriston 2011) and here briefly summarized. Writers across the social sciences have long pondered the formulation and maintenance of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> in terms of group identity and social constitution. While probably first, Ibn Khaldūn was not alone in identifying the agency of charismatic individuals set against longer-term social institutions that outlive the span of individual lives (Bourdieu 1977 [1972]; Giddens 1984; Weber 1964 [1922]). Such institutions perpetuate social memory, which can be maintained and transmitted through daily unconscious habit (Bourdieu 1977 [1972]) and also through what are described as incorporating and inscriptive practices of lesser frequency (Connerton 1989; Rowlands 1993). But these infrequent practices rely on someone knowing what is the done thing to do—hence the role of authoritative resources and charismatic leadership.</p>
         <p>Inscriptive practices archive and retrieve information and involve cognitive activity as well as bodily habit (Watkins 2004). Knowing where to go on pilgrimage, and when, and what to bring or not to bring, and the order and manner in which objects are to be used, distributed, and retrieved involves both technologies (Mauss 2006) and calculus (Donald 1991; Gell 1992:274). Manipulation of the authoritative resources for archiving and retrieving information can be a powerful tool in the development and maintenance of states and the group identities that constitute them (Giddens 1984:162–165; Kertzer 1988) and can develop in tandem with manipulation of allocative resources like the control of food surplus (D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Giddens 1984:162–265).</p>
         <p>2. Mobile Arabian pastoral groups socially constituted themselves and established group identities (as tribes, or supra-household groups) based not only on the sustained proximity of daily routine (Bourdieu 1977 [1972]; Giddens 1984) but also on the inscriptive  (in the sense of Rowlands 1993) experience of pilgrimage. The genealogical ties that linked mobile pastoralists to each other and to nonpastoral tribal members in the first millennium BC needed periodic reinforcing through the formulation and representation of social memory, especially the recitation of lineages. With infrequent, yet codified gatherings in consensually recognized places, pilgrimage (<italic>a</italic>) provided social areas for retrieval and manipulation of such authoritative resources, (<italic>b</italic>) served to strengthen <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> among mobile, fragmented people, and (<italic>c</italic>) was effective in the social constitution of broader groups than the smaller households knit with one another in immediate, daily encounters.</p>
         <p>Were these tribes who intermittently practiced pilgrimage pastoralists? Late inscriptions clearly indicate grazing rights and territorial boundaries for pastoral groups who, as did Arabia’s historical bedouin, maintained fixed strongholds and socioeconomic ties with urban dwellers and settled farmers and participated in federated complex societies (Frantsouzoff 2009; Obermeyer 1999; Pirenne 1991; Robin 1982<italic>b</italic>). The argument here is not that all ancient Arabian tribes were entirely pastoralist but that the inscriptive practices that bound tribes into states are structuring frameworks of mobile societies and the mobile societies that predated settled farming were pastoralists.</p>
         <p>The <italic>bayt</italic>-state model suggests that <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> was strongest among nonsedentary bedouin linked by kinship ties and shared hardship without material wealth. These stipulations suggest that archaeologists must look for alternatives to the allocative resources of staple surplus (grain supplies) among settled agrarian peoples that usually fuel materialist theories of emergent social complexity and status differentiation. Furthermore, calculations of available land and water show that Arabian oasis agriculture produced modest to no surplus beyond the subsistence needs of settled populations, even at its technological zenith (Wilkinson 2003:160–164), and the capacities of the earliest irrigation works in urban zones were even smaller (Schiettecatte 2010:487). Although definitive evidence of individual leaders is difficult to establish archaeologically, the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model suggests that the inscriptive mechanisms for social constitution among mobile groups, channeled by a charismatic leader as authoritative resources, played a large role in the establishment of Arabian kingdoms.</p>
         <p>In ancient Arabia, the term <italic>bedouin</italic> (Ibn Khaldūn’s) implicates mobile pastoralist tribes—people linked through genealogical ties of kinship and lineage narratives to territories and the resources these represented for grazing and other economic activities (including exchanges of aromatics that grew in the highlands for imported textiles and metals from the outside world). It is important to distinguish between the (mounted, camel-riding desert nomads) bedouins of Ibn Khaldūn’s model and mobile (sheep, goat, and cattle) pastoralists, whose range and speed was limited without camels in Arabian prehistory. The introduction of camels played a significant role in expanding the material exchange networks of indigenous pastoral groups during the first millennium BC. Large, widely-ranging livestock meant that truly specialized pastoralists could exploit hyper-arid zones (Johnson 2002). On the one hand, camels contributed to the ability of such groups to conduct swift and unpunishable raids on agricultural settlements, although textual accounts of mounted bedouins in the central deserts only appear in the first centuries AD (Dostal 1989<italic>a</italic>; Eph’al 1982; Zwettler 2000). On the other hand, camels can provide transport for material goods, including frankincense. Frankincense could not only be carried for the benefit of urban economies but also by and for the benefit of mobile pastoralists otherwise reliant on small livestock who were seeking to build flocks (e.g., McCabe 2004:80) and maintain specialized pastoralist lifestyles. In such circumstances, pastoralists with access only to marginal grazing pastures (e.g., arid interior and uplands) might collect and exchange frankincense that grew there for finished crafts and agricultural products like dates and cloth that in turn might be exchanged for new livestock. Thus, domesticated camels facilitated exchanges with farmers and meant new services could be provided, such as guiding caravans (McCorriston 2011:78–84). The introduction of camels in the first millennium BC offered new opportunities for the specialization and integration of pastoral and agricultural producers, and these economic ties were reinforced through pilgrimage.</p>
         <p>3. This relationship grew out of pilgrimages before complexity—that is gatherings, sacrifices, and feasts practiced by mobile pastoralists at open-air sanctuaries, monuments, or other sacred locations. This is crucial to the argument that the development of southern Arabian complex societies was an indigenous alternative to well-known material pathways to state formation. Recent archaeological research in the highland southern Jawl (plateau) of Ḥaḍramawt shows a sharp increase in commemorative construction of small-scale stone monuments and reuse of highland tombs during the first millennium BC (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; McCorriston et al. 2011), and it is these monuments far from settlement that provide clues about the dynamics of formative states.</p>
         <p>Re-use, re-visiting, fire, and domesticated animal bone together at tomb sites suggest ritual rites in commemoration of the dead. If the original dead were long-gone third millennium burials of the original high circular tomb builders (and most think that such tombs were robbed shortly after interment; e.g., Braemer et al. 2001; Crassard et al. 2010), then ritual revisitation one or two millennia later requires further explanation. In Ḥaḍramawt, revisitation residues at tombs may be the archaeological traces of intensified territorial claims for lineage groups (e.g., Beeston 1979; Cleuziou 2001) or groups syncretizing their own lineage narratives to visible antecedent peoples through reverence and ritual at ancestral tombs. This practice has relict manifestations in the historical appropriation of pre-Islamic tombs (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; McCorriston 2011) and maintenance of genealogies among diaspora Ḥaḍrami descendants of the Prophet Muhammad (Ho 2006; Knysh 1993).</p>
         <p>Ethnographic studies suggest that nonliterate people (as we may safely presume mobile Ḥaḍramawt peoples to have been) generally remember about five to eight generations of genealogical ancestors (Gell 1992:16). (Exceptions exist in the formidable recitation of epic genealogies like the Hawaiian Kumulipo or Indian Mahabharata, which also require rare talent and special devotion.) After eight generations, ancestors between present day and an eponymous ancestor tend to be dropped, leading albeit not inevitably to apotheosis. This process has already been suggested as the origin of local gods associated with geographically and territorially defined highland tribes in the Sabaean state (Henninger 1999 [1981]:116; Obermeyer 1999:50) and for the origins of Ḥaḍramawt’s first federal god Ḥawl (De Maigret 2002 [1996]:261–265). Similar origins may account for some of Ḥaḍramawt’s pre-Islamic shrines (Ingrams 1936:531; Rodinov 1997:108–109). Deification of tomb occupants is a recurrent motif in Arabian proto-history and pre-Islamic history (Atallah 1969:44; Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009; Chelhod 1955:118–119; Henninger 1999 [1981]:116; Lammens 1919:88, 94, 95; Pirenne 1976:204) and remains a subject of Unitarian (Wahabian) struggles against apostasy within Islam (Rentz 2004).</p>
         <p>South Arabian inscriptional evidence shows that rites and religious adherence accorded to tribal gods in high South Arabian civilizations were maintained through the ties of fictive and real kinship (Korotayev 1993<italic>a</italic>:60; Pirenne 1976:204). In highland areas of southwest Arabia, tribal gods had sanctuaries that continued to be sites of pilgrimage (Ghul 1984; Obermeyer 1999:42) during the heyday of Iron Age Arabian states: the early interventions of Sabaean <italic>mukarribs</italic> at the Jabal al-Lawdh sanctuary of ‘Athtar dhu-Dhibān are particularly well attested (Robin and Breton 1982). In the case of Ḥaḍramawt, I suggest that in the early first millennium BC, archaeological evidence of reuse and visitation at high circular tombs and tumuli can be interpreted as visits to apotheosized tribal ancestors of highland, mobile pastoral groups.</p>
         <p>Why consider such sites as anchors for the lineage narratives of pastoralists? Evidence from Ḥaḍramawt supports a widely accepted interpretation that the Arabian phenomenon of megalithic structures, tumuli, and high circular tombs was as the work of mobile pastoral groups (Buffa 2007:237; De Maigret and Antonini 2005; Edens 2002; Newton and Zarins 2000; Steimer-Herbet 2004; Zarins 1992). First of all, surveys show no permanent settlements with durable architecture in proximity or even within a day’s walk of most small-scale monument sites (McCorriston et al. 2005). Even small-scale water management structures in the highlands lack adjacent settlement: if used for irrigation, they were used by mobile people, most likely agro-pastoralists (Harrower 2008<italic>a</italic>). The sparse late second and early first millennium archaeological records in the southern Arabian highlands point not to a lack of occupants or decline in socioeconomic complexity but to a climatic downturn (Lézine et al. 2010) with continued, albeit tethered, mobility near springs and permanent water sources (restricting the distribution of archaeological records to areas where current population density has effaced and reworked earlier traces; e.g., McCorriston 2000; Zarins 2001). Where sedentary late second to first millennia BC populations first appeared in the mouths of major discharge systems at the desert margins—an inhospitable environment for sedentary life—mobile groups had preceded them as corporate groups in exclusive territories in the third millennium BC (e.g., Braemer et al. 2001; Cleuziou 1997, 2001, 2007). Sparse second millennium BC archaeological remains also are consistent with the appropriation of authoritative resources by fewer charismatic leaders (thus a smaller number of tumuli with stelae, wall tombs, and reused HCT through time).</p>
         <p>In addition, the sacrifices left at tombs are mostly the remains of domesticated caprines (Everhart, McCorriston, and Twiss, forthcoming) rather than wild game. Prestige metal weapons (of the kind rarely found in tombs and visible on monuments and rock art) point to widespread economic networks associated with pastoral mobility during the second millennium BC (Giumlia-Mair et al. 2002; McCorriston 2012; Newton and Zarins 2000; Vogt 1997). Perishable items like grain, dates, livestock, textiles, dried fish, honey, dyestuffs, and frankincense may also have circulated along these networks, which plausibly expanded in increasingly arid environments. Pastoral groups can reduce the herd size required for their subsistence by exchanging with agricultural producers (Dahl and Hjort 1976: 267; Johnson 2002) and could thereby reduce grazing pressure under increasingly arid conditions.</p>
         <p>Finally, faunal evidence associated with monuments shows that mobile cattle pastoralists claimed and maintained territories through sacrifice and commemoration at gathering places in the southern Arabian highlands from the fifth millennium BC, long before agriculture was available (McCorriston et al. 2012). Social collectivities based on territories therefore cannot be a consequence of agriculture and settlement, and the pastoralists who developed tribally defined social entities—that is, lineage-based, segmentary allegiances in geographic territories—to defend and assure access to resources were the originators of the Arabian <italic>bayt</italic>, the building block of Arabian society (Beeston 1972, 1979; Korotayev 1993<italic>a</italic>).</p>
         <p>4. Federalizing sovereigns directed pilgrimage to central capitols where tithes could be channeled to the coffers of the sovereign and paramount social groups. Powerful groups, known in the later Sabaean kingdom as <italic>qaylite bayts</italic> (Korotayev 1993<italic>b</italic>, 1994<italic>a</italic>), maintained control of resources in part by distribution to client groups affiliated through the idiom of kinship and lineage (Beeston 1972, 1979; Korotayev 1994<italic>b</italic>). This was an arrangement that effectively masked wealth-based class relations in terms of kinship and lineage, a shift in <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> significant in the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model. South Arabian inscriptions show that the ruling group—initially drawn together through a charismatic <italic>mukarrib</italic>—appropriated preexisting pilgrimage and manipulated the authoritative resources of a pilgrimage society toward consolidation and maintenance of federal identity. Korotayev (2003:66) traces the development of the Sabaean confederacy from <italic>mukarrib</italic>-led commonwealth to kingdom with the ascendancy of the deity Almaqah lord of Awwam (at Ma’rib), who received more tithes and dedications than ‘Athtar (a widely recognized and probably earlier southern Arabian deity [Robin 2000]). Sabaeans called themselves “<italic>wld ‘lmqh</italic>” (children of Almaqah), and “the national god was a symbol of fusion … of the heterogenic elements of the state” (Ryckmans 1973<italic>a</italic>:101; translation mine from French). In Ḥaḍramawt, the cult of Sayyin integrated segmented lineage groups into one ethnic, cultural, and religious community (De Maigret 2002 [1996]:265; Frantsouzoff 2001:61). Ryckmans (1975:447) argues that the very concept of the state is based on a particular relationship, often formulaic in representation, between the federal god, the sovereign, and the nation. Political sovereigns also assumed intermediary roles between the tribal leaders and the federal god and presided over socially constituting rituals—sacrifices and feasts at state temples, collection and apportionment of offerings, royal hunts, and intercession for rain (Korotayev 2003; Pirenne 1976:183; Ryckmans 1973<italic>b</italic>).</p>
         <p>While there is strong likelihood that the intervention of Sabaeans in Ḥaḍramawt catalyzed the emergence of a Ḥaḍramawt state (Frantsouzoff 2005), the consolidation of state identity was firmly linked to the Ḥaḍramawt federalizing gods, first Ḥawl and Sayyin together, then Sayyin alone after 500 BC (Sedov 2005:22). Sayyin’s link to bull iconography and cattle sacrifices suggests long-term continuities with the ritual practices of indigenous cattle pastoralists of southern Arabia (Dostal 1983; McCorriston et al. 2012), whose descendant traditions persisted socially and economically among historical occupants of Mahrah and Dhufār (Dostal 1989<italic>a</italic>; Zarins 1992). Toward Sayyin’s sanctuaries in Shabwa and other lowland Ḥaḍramawt centers were directed pilgrimages and sacrifices here suggested to have been previously offered at the highland tombs of eponymous ancestors or at revered tombs to which groups attached themselves through reuse and appropriative visits and sacrifice.</p>
         <p>The <italic>bayt</italic>-state model implicates charismatic leadership and strong group feeling in such dynamics. Archaeological correlates for strengthened <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> exist in the reuse of high circular tombs and tumulus monuments in the first millennium BC. Additional archaeological evidence is also present in the chronologically discrete (200 BC–300 AD) construction of small-scale stone monuments known as <italic>triliths</italic> or <italic>athafy</italic>, which have been etymologically and historically linked to commemoration of gatherings and social group identities (Bin ‘Aqil and McCorriston 2009). <italic>Athafy</italic> were constructed of unworked local materials, and, while crude in construction, they conform to a rigid design template that signaled information, about which archaeologists can now only guess. The <italic>athafy</italic> of Ḥaḍramawt belong to a geographic distribution that includes the highlands of Mahrah, Dhufār, and the interior of northern Oman and the Arabian Gulf (Wilkinson 2003:176–177) as well as the interiors of eastern and western Saudi Arabia (Zarins et al. 1981). The construction of <italic>athafy</italic>, which are highly symbolic alignments of upright stones with lines of hearths before them, fall into a broader Arabian tradition of setting up stone benches (<italic>zf</italic>; e.g., Robin and Breton 1982:610), standing stones (Atallah 1969; Keall 2010; Mouton 2010; Pirenne 1976, 1991), or platforms (McCorriston 2011; McCorriston et al. 2011) to commemorate the gathering, sacrifice, and feasts that strengthen <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>. Their construction coincides temporally with state-sponsored pilgrimage to Ḥaḍramawt’s urban centers after 500 BC and with fires set on high circular tombs and tumuli.</p>
         <p>That strengthened local manifestations of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> are apparent in the highland regions of tribal pastoralists during the confederated Ḥaḍramawt state is an important expectation in the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model. As federalizing pilgrimage drew tribes-people into Shabwa and other state centers, tithes were collected from pilgrims assured of safe passage and conflict-free exchange with other tribes (Korotayev 2003:70; Pliny 1938:63). Among such tithes were surely frankincense and myrrh collected in tribally held highland territories. While none doubt that Arabian states grew rich on caravan traffic in resinous aromatics, there has been little attention to the source of these—in highland areas, away from immediate control of irrigated urban centers, and most accessible to pastoralists whose tribal territories included the habitats of frankincense and myrrh. The means by which frankincense arrived in urban centers lie at the heart of Arabian state formation. Arabian states were founded on pilgrimage practices, and the model implies that these were directed by charismatic leaders. Traffic with faraway states in the Mediterranean and Asia came later and brought the wealth implicated in state demise, not state emergence in the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model.</p>
         <p>5. The <italic>bayt</italic>-state model therefore rests on Ibn Khaldūnian axes of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, segmentary tribal identities within territories and strengthened through lineage narratives, and charismatic leadership. <italic>Mukarribs</italic> or earlier agents wrested and directed pilgrimage practices toward places by initiating or reorganizing lineage narratives, which can be inferred from archaeological records in the revisitations at tombs. The <italic>bayt</italic>-state model clearly outlines the transformative process through which a lineage head as sacrificer and pilgrimage leader at a local shrine (Pirenne 1976; Ryckmans 1973<italic>a</italic>:98) was transformed through strengthened <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> and the economic power of wealth (accumulated tithes and their allocation) into royal authority. By the time epigraphers and archaeologists can document a full-fledged kingdom centered in lowland irrigated oases, ancestors had long since been apotheosized, and the narrative of social identity in <italic>bayts</italic> masked (in the metaphor of territorial kinship) a class society based on wealth. As territories became more populated in prehistory, people turned to diversified and intensified economic strategies for their exploitation. These included irrigation agriculture, exchange, and specialization of production. Social identities nevertheless remained focused on pilgrimage, that is, gathering, sacrifice, and feast as a way of bringing people together (at ancestral tombs and other territory places). Mobile pastoral groups—the bedouin of the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model—are the basis for and historically gave rise to the emergence of complex societies in ancient Arabia.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>There are a number of important implications raised by the identification of Arabian states as a case of indigenous state formation and by the application of Ibn Khaldūn’s modified theory to explain it. First, the core-periphery models that heretofore explained Arabian states as secondary and peripheral need some reexamination. Such models rely on exchange of raw or minimally processed materials in the periphery for highly manufactured goods generated in the core, a condition typical of capitalist world systems and nineteenth-century colonial empires but not true in the ancient Near East (Wallerstein 1974; cf. Stein 1999). In the Arabian case, long-distance trade in frankincense and other aromatics may date back to the Early Holocene (Zarins 2001). Archaeologists might reasonably argue that the first millennium BC introduction of camel transport and reorganized exchanges with the Mediterranean and West Asia did create new trade opportunities and a flow of luxury goods. But if Arabian states were truly the <italic>incense kingdoms</italic> that they have so often been dubbed, then it is critical to understand the mechanisms of incense production in tribal highland territories as a resource to which urban dwellers could have access through tribal consensus. This consensus was obtained through pilgrimage relationships to federal temples and federal intervention in tribal political and territorial systems.</p>
         <p>Arabian kingdoms did develop around settled communities reliant on large-scale irrigation works (Brunner and Haefner 1986; Harrower 2009), but they were not consolidated through elite control and redistribution of an agricultural surplus as would be expected in cultural-evolutionary models of primary state formation. The Arabian archaeological record provides no evidence of surplus storage and redistributive apparatus at major centers, apart from the facilities for temple feasts offered at pilgrimage (Sedov 2000:3, 2005). With limited agricultural land supporting relatively small populations, there was little staple surplus to collect or convert into wealth (cf. D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Halstead 1989), particularly from rural communities. By the time archaeological evidence suggests an agricultural basis capable of generating a substantial surplus, the mechanisms of social constitution were already firmly rooted in the economic base of mobile pastoralism, which preceded farming by at least 1500 years. Dedicatory inscriptions emphasize offerings to the temples as sacrifices, often in the form of votive statues and plaques, and temples have been suggested as “insurance companies” for the members of respective tribes and communities (Korotayev 2003). But the main function of temples was to bind communities sociopolitically. Allocative resources from agricultural production such as the staple surplus of agricultural grains that fueled status differentiation in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus do not appear to have been early components of complex economies in Arabia.</p>
         <p>Instead, even as I assert that agricultural surplus was nearly epiphenomenal to state formation in Arabia, I offer a new perspective on formation of complex societies, one that inverts a materialist model at the base of cultural-evolutionism to emphasize ideological (Hodder 1991; Leone 1982) and indeed long-term structural frameworks (Sahlins 1976). To summarize, a cultural-historical sequence in Ḥaḍramawt now suggests that<list>

                     <italic>‘Aṣabīyah</italic> began at least as early as the middle fifth millennium BC. Genealogically-based groups (tribes) appeared in the third millennium BC with the construction of high circular tombs.</p>

                  <p>There exists almost no archaeological record of the middle to late second millennium BC. New cultural markers—decorative ceramics for presentation and display rather than preparation and storage, and few localized and isolated architectural traces, possibly sanctuaries—are best explained as the remains of small sectors, possibly seasonally sedentary, of socially integrated agro-pastoral communities that were, for the most part, mobile. The focus should be on these wider collectives rather than on developing agricultural settlement systems. Ibn Khaldūn argues that <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> will be most strong among peoples with few material possessions and that states arise under conditions of strong <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>.</p>

                  <p>The role of pilgrimage in Arabian states represents a fundamentally different reliance on authoritative resources (i.e., genealogical knowledge and claim to first ancestor) over the allocative surpluses (i.e., material goods) provisioning emergent elites in many archaic states.</p>

         <p>Ibn Khaldūn’s <italic>bayt</italic>-state model of <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> and charismatic leadership provides the crucial social institutions and agency at the heart of many contemporary anthropological and sociological approaches to social change (e.g., Bourdieu 1977 [1972]; Braudel 1972 [1966]; Giddens 1984; Weber 1964 [1922]:46–72). Had his manuscripts been sooner translated from Arabic and integrated into a Western canon, Ibn Khaldūn would be fairly judged the founder of sociology some 5 centuries before the great contributions of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim. His work, in many ways prescient of latter theoretical frameworks, was unknown to Western scholars before the mid-nineteenth century. Convergences may be noted but no influences: Ibn Khaldūn’s <italic>Muqaddimah</italic> stands alongside the greatest pieces of historical, philosophical, and sociological thought while sadly and oddly isolated by its historical context (Cheddadi 2006:499; Goumeziane 2006:179–184), making it relatively inaccessible to contemporary social sciences. The <italic>bayt</italic>-state model advanced here is not the only attempt to draw inspiration from Ibn Khaldūn’s work for the interpretation of ancient state formation. Peter Magee (2007) argued that southeastern Arabian oasis formation was an indigenous process drawing on <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> without discussion of important factors that sustain it, such as pilgrimage and authoritative resources manipulated by charismatic leaders. Peter Turchin (2009) offered a general model for scaled-up polity sizes stemming from antagonistic interactions between mobile steppe pastoralists and settled farmers at steep environmental gradients worldwide. In Turchin’s comparative historical approach, no archaeological data have been used to test strengthened group feeling among pastoralists with poor material culture. The model also differs from the <italic>bayt</italic>-state approach in its reliance on antagonism between existing farmers and herders and in its emphasis on evolutionary theory of group selection, rather than on charismatic leaders manipulating authoritative resources. Similar points include the state appropriation of “supranational ideologies” (Turchin 2009), what the <italic>bayt</italic>-state model considers pilgrimage.</p>
         <p>Relying on Ibn Khaldūn’s work need not contradict several fundamental tenets in the historical materialism of Marx (underpinning most archaeological, cultural-ecological, and even evolutionary approaches; Sahlins 1976). In his reliance on the conditions of desert life, Ibn Khaldūn offers a convergent emphasis on a material-environmental base critical in historical materialism. With shared desert hardship as a crucible for strong <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, Ibn Khaldūn’s approach aligns with materialist theory in which the social relations of production pattern with the means of production, in this case, the economic and environmental constraints of food production in desert settings. Furthermore, an emphasis on material surplus as the basis for class struggle (Marx) and loss of group feeling (Ibn Khaldūn) provide key areas on which to focus archaeological inquiry into the emergence of states. Where archaeological records show increasing material cultural remains with sedentism and emergent diversification and complexities in economy, then <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic> is challenged by luxury and faces decline or needs to be rallied by charismatic leaders whose authoritative resources (how to perform pilgrimage) reinforce social solidarity. Any attempt to interpret an archaeological record within a <italic>bayt</italic>-state framework must identify and investigate material correlates for strengthened <italic>‘aṣabīyah</italic>, a challenging proposition in the face of what Ibn Khaldūn’s theory predicts should be a mobile life with bare necessities and sparse in material goods and permanent architecture. In the heart of Arabia where Islam was born, Ibn Khaldūn’s <italic>Muqaddimah</italic> and <italic>bayt</italic>-state model provide the appropriate theoretical framework for an explicitly Islamic archaeology.</p>
