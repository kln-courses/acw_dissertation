<plain_text><page sequence="1">8 Alchemy in the Ancient World: From Science to Magic PAUL T. KEYSER "Alchemy" is the anglicised Byzantine name given to what its practitioners referred to as "the Art" (texvn) or "Knowledge" (ejivott||iti), often characterised as divine (0e(a), sacred (iepa) or mystic ((xvoxikti).1 While this techne underwent many changes in the course of its life of over two thousand years (and there are traces of it even in modern times, as I will discuss), a recognisable common denominator in all the writings is the search for a method of transforming base metals (copper, iron, lead, tin) into noble (electrum, gold or silver).2 There is unfortunately no modern critical edition of any of these writings (the extant editions being old or uncritical or both), though the Bud6 has begun the process.3 In this essay I sketch the background and origins of the ancient alchemy, as well as its later transmutation into a mystical art of personal transformation. Finally I turn to the modern period and briefly examine the influence of this mystical tradition in our own world-picture. Background I begin with the first evidence of human chemical technology, which takes us back, well before the ancient period of merely 2,000 years ago, to the Palaeolithic Middle Pleistocene of 200,000 years ago—and the mastery of fire.4 The achievement of this first controlled chemical reaction marks a 1 W.

No doubt (though we lack positive proof) fire was used for cooking food and hardening wood—themselves important and mysterious processes (why after all should destructive heat make things harder and more durable?). But 26,000 years ago (one cycle of the precession of the equinoxes), south of what is now Brno in Czechoslovakia our ancestors first produced a new material having properties entirely dissimilar to those of the parent material—I mean baked clay.6 But this new material was not to be used for pottery until a period more than twice as long as all of recorded history had passed—the people at Dolni Vestonice seem to have been chiefly interested in causing their molded animal figurines to explode on firing. This is relatively easy to accomplish with a sufficiently wet and thick clay body (though harder with loess, the raw material at Dolni)—potters must be taught (as I know by experience) to build or throw thinly. These explosions were probably ritualistic (the archaeologists often interpret the unknown as the sacred: omne ignotum pro sacro)—I am reminded of the fire-cracked Chinese oracle bones. Fire hardened clay, and this miracle material came to be more common than stone, in the form of pottery vessels (the original form of which was probably clay-lined baskets). After the Agricultural Revolution fire was used not only to cook but to bakeP This again marks a decisive step—that fire hardened and preserved wood, bone, clay and food had long been known. The new magic was leaven—the invisible yeast preserved by bakers in sourdough (as fire was in fennel-stalks)—which transformed clay-like dough into raised bread. Again the symbolism was powerful enough after millennia to lodge at the core of Christianity. Doubtless Neanderthals like jackdaws collected shiny rocks. Among these were pyrites, the most valuable, the fire-stone, the fire-starter, as well as bits of copper and gold of no apparent value (we have come so far that pyrites is now called "fool's gold").8 At some point it was discovered that Brain and A.

Keyser 355 the latter stones were soft enough that they could be carved like tough wood or bone, later still that they could like stiff dough or clay with difficulty be pounded into shapes. This hammering hardens the copper. The thought must have soon occurred—perhaps this stuff could be further hardened like clay, wood, bone in the fire? It was tried—and the failure was a source of wonder. Copper does not, like clay or bone, fracture if heated and quenched, nor does it harden—but rather it becomes softer! This made it easier to hammer. These early discoveries seem to have occurred in Armenia or North Iran, about seven thousand years ago.9 The earliest copper finds in Mesopotamia are at Tepe Gawra (4000 3500 B.C.)—a site to which I will refer again.10 Just a bit later we have the earliest dated smelted copper (and copper slag) from Tepe Yahya in Iran (3800 B.C.), and at about the same time there is evidence of copper smelting in Egypt." Smelting was probably discovered accidentally in a pottery kiln (kilns are first recorded by archaeologists at this time)—green malachite was reduced to red copper.12 This was a magical transformation, like the firing of clay and the baking of bread, and represents the first artificial production or imitation of a natural substance—specifically the production of a valuable metal from something to which the metal has no resemblance or known connection. Near Ur of the Chaldees at A1 'Ubaid have been found the earliest examples (from ca. 3500-3200 B.C.) of the deliberate production of tin bronze.13 It is not clear just how this was done, but from an alchemical point of view the most significant fact is that it was. This was probably a Sumerian discovery, as only their language distinguishes clearly between copper and bronze: copper is urudu and bronze zabar.14 By doing something to a red metal the Sumerians produced a yellow metal (which was more 9 A.

Silver was rarer than gold in Egypt; by about 2000 B.C. it was being produced in the Near East from argentiferous galena by cupellation—that is the galena was roasted to produce lead, which was oxidised in a fired clay crucible leaving only the silver.22 By the fifth century B.C. the Egyptians had learned the long-known cementation process by which impure gold or electrum is heated with clay, sand and salt in a closed vessel to produce refined or purified gold. Both processes must have seemed magical and arbitrary.23 I have discussed prehistoric and early metallurgy—the connection to alchemy is clear. Now I must make a detour into Egyptian and Sumerian chemistry—also connected with alchemy—to mention two other important artificial substances: glass and beer. The first artificial stone was fired clay. The Egyptians were using a gypsum mortar (similar to our cement or concrete) from predynastic times, and it is they who invented faience (a fired ground-quartz paste).24 We do not 15 T. T.

Keyser 357 know where or when glass was first made, but it has been found in Egypt from 2500 B.C., in Mesopotamia a bit later, usually in the form of beads.25 Popular in Egypt primarily during the New Kingdom, glass long remained a fixture of Mesopotamian technology—in fact the oldest extant glass recipe, from the seventeenth century B.C., is a Sumerian-Babylonian cuneiform tablet.26 The writer "anticipates" the deliberate obscurity of later alchemical texts, but the recipe is recognizably that for a green glass. Later seventh century B.C. recipes produce soda glass and crown glass equivalent to our modern glasses—but the recipes include the building of human embryos into the furnace walls. One of the Egyptian recipes found its way into the Greco-Roman tradition as caerulium: sand, green malachite, chalk and salt were fused at just the right temperature to produce a sky-blue glassy stone27—without any embryos. The fermentation of sweet fruit juices—wine—probably goes back to the Palaeolithic and occurs spontaneously due to the presence of the yeast of the mold family found on the fruit skins.28 This miracle too was long remembered as such—the Greeks worshipped Dionysus as the bringer of wine, wine is symbolic of the blessings of God in the Hebrew Scriptures and wine is, with bread, one of the sacred substances of the Christian religion. The connection of wine specifically with alchemy I will address shortly. The invention of beer is often credited to the Egyptians—the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (1. 20. 4) credits it to the god Osiris. The process of malting (soaking grain in water till it begins to sprout) generates the sugar necessary for fermentation—the whole process is far more complex than the production of wine 29 A neo-Babylonian tablet of the fifth-fourth century B.C. preserves the Sumerian beer recipe:30 we even know how the Sumerians and Egyptians drank it—through straws (Fig. 1). This beer process is also recorded for us in Greek writings—in the 25 Lucas (above, note 9) 179-84; J. R. Partington, The Origins and Development of Applied Chemistry (London 1935; repr.

A.D. 300 by Zosimus31—where it is explicitly connected with the alchemical transformation of base metals to gold.32 Origin The techniques of the Egyptians and Mesopotamians represent the foundation stones of the edifice we call alchemy. Built onto this techne was the Greek philosophy of nature. So far as we know these Near Eastern peoples were not inclined to seek explanations for these processes. But from the times of Thales (seventh century B.C.) the Greeks began to develop a natural philosophy, seeking to understand the world not in terms of the actions of anthropomorphic deities alone but also in terms of "natural" forces. The earliest of these thinkers were hylozoistic monists—they explained everything in terms of one thing, which was some material endowed with life-like properties. Thus Thales thought everything was originally water, out of which earth and living things grew; others suggested air or fire. Empedocles, Plato and Aristotle contributed to the development of the "Four-Element" Theory which persisted down to the seventeenth century A.D. (Shakespeare and Milton). In this model everything was made of some combination of the four elements (Fire, Air, Water, Earth), related as in Fig. 2.33 In this theory the two pairs of primary opposites Hot/Cold, Dry/Wet— themselves like our modern quarks never separately observable—combine to produce the four elements. Each element has its natural place and a natural motion towards that place (up/down). To explain the perpetual circular motions of the seven planets AristoUe added a separate and distinct material "first body" which he called aither, and a non-material "fifth substance" to explain the soul. Later in the third century B.C. these two concepts were blurred and merged under the name "quintessence."34 To this last point I shall return, but first I must explain the chemical theories which result from this four-element model. First, elements (stoicheia) may transform into one another by a change in their constituent opposites—thus Water becomes Earth when the Wet leaves and the Dry comes, a mixture of Fire and Water may become Earth plus Air by a kind of double decomposition reaction (Cold/Wet + Hot/Dry -&gt; Cold/Dry + 31 Lucas (above, note 9) 14; Forbes, SAT EI (1965) 70 and Arnold (above, note 29) 85, all from Chr.

Keyser 359 Hot/Wet), and (hardest of all) Water may become Fire if both Cold and Wet pass away and Hot and Dry come to be. So much for atomic physics— chemistry involves mixtures or blends of the four elements. Ever since Anaximenes had postulated that the elements transform into one another by rarefaction and condensation, the notion that mathematics might enter chemistry was about. Plato in the Timaeus tries to construct the elements from fundamental triangles grouped into four of the five "Platonic" solids (thus betraying his Pythagoreanism). Aristotle too allows arithmetic—there are differences in degree of the four elements and a compound will exhibit a certain ratio of combination: this is effectively Dalton's "Law of Definite Proportions" of 1808. This theory remained not without application.35 For example we read that substances made of Earth plus Water are solidified by heat because it drives off the water, and by cold which drives out the natural heat—in this case (if Earth predominates) heat will again liquify them. The example of iron is given—it can be melted by extraordinary heat (and this is part of the making of steel).36 Again, gold, silver and other metals are composed of water for they are all melted by heat. Aristotle wisely refrained, however, from assigning specific numbers to the compounds (cp. Meteor. 4. 10 [389a7—23]). Plato (who also made metals of water) did assign definite numerical ratios to the elemental transformations: 2 Fire = 1 Air, 2.5 Air = 1 Water (Tim. 56e). Aristotle does not mean that ordinary water and earth combine to form substances such as gold or iron. In fact both stones and metals are formed by the agency of an ill-defined pair of "exhalations" (dva0u(j.idaeiq)— metals primarily by the moist exhalation, stones primarily by the dry. But all metals are affected by fire and contain some earth (from the dry exhalation)—only gold is not affected by fire.37 Presumably the baser the metal the more earth or "dry exhalation" it contained. Plato too indicates that the water which forms metals is a special kind of which the best is gold ('Tim. 58d, 59b): Pindar had already proclaimed water as best, together with gold which shines out (Oly. 1. 1, cp. Isthm. 5. 1-3). Aristotle was president and chairman of his own university—his successor Theophrastus wrote a number of books in which he ventilated difficulties with the four-element theory (without suggesting a competing theory). For example he points out that fire is self-generating yet requires fuel, can be created but mostly by violence (i.e., not naturally: De Igne 1 5). More important for the rise of alchemy, he records a number of recipes for preparing artificial stones. He knows that yellow ochre (&lt;»%pa) when heated in closed airtight pots turns to red ochre (^iX-coq: De Lap. 52-54). 35 See I. During, Aristotle's Chemical Treatise: Meteorologica Book TV (Goteborg 1944). 36 Forbes, SAT IX. (1972) 218. 37 D. E. Eichholz, "Aristotle's Theory of the Formation of Metals and Minerals," CQ 43 (1949) 141-46.</page><page sequence="8">360 Illinois Classical Studies, XV.2 Again he gives recipes for making white lead (yinA&gt;0iov) and green verdigris (ioq) by exposing lead and red copper to vinegar (to make the acetates: De Lap. 56-57). Finally from red cinnabar is made quicksilver (xmoq apyopoq) by pounding the red sandy substance mixed with vinegar in a copper mortar with a copper pestle (De Lap. 60). I draw attention to the interest in the color transformation as well as to the transformations between stony or earthy substances (cinnabar, white lead, verdigris) and metals (lead, copper, quicksilver). This is the sort of thing in which the alchemists were greatly interested. Singled out for remark is the method of producing brass (with a beautiful color) by mixing a certain earth with copper (De Lap. 49)38—Aristotle himself had already remarked of bronze production that the tin seems to disappear into the copper leaving only the color of the tin (GC 1.10 [328bl3-14]). Physical Matters of Alchemy Such scientific speculations contined throughout antiquity—theories were modified and reiterated. Alchemy proper began when a neo-Pythagorean writer applied magical notions of sympathy and antipathy to the Egyptian techniques sketched above.39 This was the obscure but influential Bolus, who wrote under the name of Democritus about 200 B.C.40 His treatise, Physical and Mystical Matters, is partly preserved in various alchemical MSS and contains recipes for imitating purple dye and a mystical vision whose message is, "Nature delights in nature, nature conquers nature, nature controls nature," followed by recipes for the imitation of gold.41 These notions of sympathy were for the era very scientific—the Stoics believed in an all-pervasive pneuma (spirit) which bound the universe together in sympathy and this was used to justify astrology. The planets had been associated with metals by the Babylonians: Gold/Sun, Silver/Moon, Lead/Saturn, Electrum/Jupiter, Iron/Mars, Copper/Venus, Tin/Mercury (Fig. 38 See the commentaries of E. R. Caley and J. F. C. Richards, Theophraslus on Stones (Columbus, OH 1956) and D. E. Eichholz, Theophraslus: De Lapidibus (Oxford 1965). 39 See in general the references in note 1 above, and L.

Later texts make Tin/Jupiter and Mercury/Mercury.42 The association of the planets with certain divinities is Babylonian, as the Epinomis attributed to Plato tells,43 although Plato already in the Timaeus builds on the (probably universal) belief in the divinity of the planets (Tim. 38c-40d). And astrology is connected with alchemy from the beginning, for almost the earliest astrological text of which we have traces, that called Nechepso-Petosiris after the two Egyptian kings who allegedly wrote the thing (it is probably second century B.C.), quotes Bolus' mystical message, "Nature delights in nature,... "44 (note that the order of the planets in Fig. 3 is the astrological order). Much discussion has been generated over the place where alchemy originated—probably it was indeed Alexandria in Egypt.45 In any case all our earliest traces of it come from Alexandria. While the number of recipes preserved is too vast easily to survey, a few high points must be mentioned. Bolus gives recipes using arsenic, antimony or mercury for transforming copper to silver (Phys. Myst. 4)—thus coloring the surface— gold is produced by tinting silver with sulfur {Phys. Myst. 7). But we often do not understand just what the alchemist was about—obscurity seems to have been paramount for him—or her. Two of our earliest extant treatises are by women. One is very obscure indeed although we know the authoress, Cleopatra (not the queen) sought to make gold: Fig. 4.46 Note the symbolism of the Ouroboros (tail-eating) snake, and the inner circle of Greek (el&lt;; eotvv o ocpiq o ex&lt;dv tov iov nexa 8t&gt;o ovv&amp;rmaxa) "one is the snake which has the ios (rust?) after two compositions"; note as well the 42 Berthelot, CAAG I (1887) 73-85, 92-106; for the later text see II (1888) 24-25 Greek, 25-26 French. 43 Epin. 987a-d; J.

But what does it all mean? In the lower right is a distillation apparatus, to which I will return after mentioning the second female writer on alchemy: Maria the Jewess after whom the bain-marie (or double-boiler) is named.47 Note the bain-marie just below the mystic circle; the TpiPiKoq, "three-armed still," is explicitly given as Maria's invention.48 Apparently numerous pieces of apparatus were her inventions, but it seems that the bain-marie itself was known to Theophrastus (De Odor. 22) 49 It is not impossible that she made some modification or improvement—stills had been known for ages as well (to this point I shall return). One of her procedures involved the use of "our lead" or "four-body" (tetrasoma), an alloy of copper, iron, lead and tin which is "killed," corrupted and then whitened and yellowed to produce gold; another involved "salting" the base metal (this procedure was called taricheia, which is the ordinary word for mummification). The notion of preliminary corruption and later ennobling is consistent with Aristotle's doctrine of elemental change (as noted already). She also mentions the standard alchemical "divine water" usually interpreted as sulfuretted water (i.e. a solution of hydrogen sulfide or calcium sulfides) which was used in the yellowing stage. Maria's tribikos was based on earlier stills. Since it is not usually realised how early is the evidence of distillation, allow me to digress a moment. Earlier I warned that Tepe Gawra would be mentioned again. It is from this site that the world's oldest still comes—a 3500 B.C. Sumerian device (Fig. 5). This seems to have been used to distill botanical essences—which would collect in the double rim and would later be sponged out, so the texts tell us.50 The stages in the evolution of the alchemical still are shown in Fig. 6.51 In the first century A.D. Greco-Roman writers record the distillation of mercury (Diosc. MM 5. 95 [110]) and pitch (Diosc. MM 1. 72. 3 [96]). Experiments have shown that the ancient styles of stills could easily have distilled the water off from vinegar to concentrate acetic acid, and, as well, could have been used to distill alcohol.52 Maria's early stills (the tribikos) were made of copper—late in the first century A.D. blown glass was invented and she preferred glass for her later apparatus.

Mesopotamia, and associated with magicians. This object consisted of a sealed copper tube down the middle of which was suspended an iron rod: Fig. 7. The tube once contained a liquid, probably vinegar, and seems to have been an ancient wet-cell or battery. Modern tests show that it could generate about one half volt at a few milliamps. What could the device have been used for? The first publication suggested electroplating and even the physicist George Gamow agreed, but the technological context is absent. I have suggested a connection to the attested use of living electric rays (torpedines) in the first century A.D. as a local analgesic in cases of gout and headache, and modern clinical practice (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) confirms that about one half volt at a few milliamps is effective.60 The plating of metals was practised in antiquity, by various more or less mechanical or thermal means: for example in Roman times a gold or silver amalgam was applied and the mercury boiled off (Vitr. 7. 8. 4; Pliny, HN 33. 20. 64-65, 33. 32. 100, 33. 42. 125, 34. 48. 162-63; PLeydenX 27 and 57). A more chemical process, called cementation or surface leaching, in which a base alloy of gold or of silver is attacked by substances which corrode away the base metal near the surface so that the object appears nobler, was also used: our earliest recipe for this is in Bolus, Physical and Mystical Matters 12.61 Archaeological evidence suggests that this or some similar method of coloring metals was practised from a very early date in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Two Egyptian examples are especially instructive. In King Tut's tomb were found numerous gold rosettes which were colored purple. The American physicist Wood was called in to solve the problem and he determined that the gold contained 1% iron and traces of orpiment (native arsenic sulfide: As2S3) and that when such an alloy is cold worked and then heated a bit below red heat, a purple or violet color is produced.62 To the empurpling of gold I will return in a moment. The second example concerns an Egyptian bowl and ewer of the V Dynasty in the Metropolitan Museum which have been shown to be arsenic plated, as well as an Anatolian bull figurine of the late third millennium B.C. similarly plated.63 The alchemical texts speak of arsenic (or antimony) plating as a way of producing silver from copper: PLeydenX 23. 60 P.

Keyser 365 One widespread use of precious metals in antiquity was for coinage, a monopoly of the state.64 Now it seems that in the first century B.C. the incidence of coin forging rose, judging by the Roman law passed against it65 The method of fakery in view seems to have been producing pewter (tin-lead alloy) coins. Either plated base metal or substitute alloys could be detected by their lower density, especially if gold was to be imitated. In the case of imitation silver, for which the alchemists give numerous recipes, including at least one involving arsenic,66 the density problem would not have been so severe—though anyone willing to use Archimedes' method could detect the forgery. Yet coins of very low density made not only of pewter but even of an arsenic or antimony alloy have been found—the earliest examples are from Macedonia, not far from Thessaly and Thrace.67 Perhaps these developments in the production of imitation silver by the alchemists prompted Menelaus to write his book on the density of alloys in the late first century A.D.68 To the alchemical writers (Cleopatra, Maria, Zosimus, etc.) the most important aspect, even of the "scientific" alchemy I have been describing, was the production or imitation of gold. There are numerous recipes, some incomprehensible, some involving merely coloring the surface or debasing the gold with both copper and silver, to preserve the color. By far the most interesting involves another apparatus attributed to Maria the Jewess, the KtipoxaKii;.69 Originally a device used by encaustic painters to keep their colored waxes soft, it was used by the alchemists to produce alloys, especially their most successful imitation of gold—a 13% mercury in copper alloy, used until recently by jewelers as a substitute gold.

To the final stage I will return in a moment. Another variation, mentioned above, involved the use of tetrasomy ("four-body"), a copper-iron-lead-tin alloy (on which Maria improved by substituting a simpler copper-lead alloy), which was heated over sulfur. This produced a complex black sulfide. A similar process was known in Egypt from New Kingdom times, for making niello—a fused black copper-silver sulfide known to Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D.71 In any case the reduction of base metal to non-metallic "matter" was necessary, as Aristotle had taught, before any upward transformation was possible. I have mentioned Zosimus' interest in fermentation—this may be explained by reference to alchemical theories in which the black mass was converted to silver then gold by "divine water" whose action is explicitly compared to that of yeast.72 To this water I would compare Plato's water from which gold forms. Instead of mercury or sulfur, orpiment was sometimes used to act as the yellowing agent.73 The final stage, after the yellowing to gold, was iosis—which word could mean corruption/rust or purpling. Usually commentators prescind from giving a precise chemical explanation, but the purple gold (containing orpiment) of Tutankhamon perhaps provides a parallel. Is it possible the alchemists were in fact trying to produce purple gold? Mystical Matters But we must turn to the iosis of alchemy itself—its mystical stage. Why did this occur? As humans we are distinct from the animals by our Faustian urge for the unattainable of which greed is the excess and contentment the defect. Again we are distinguished by our individuality—ape and dog packs show the evolutionary priority of the State (as Eduard Meyer has shown). Mysticism seems to me to be, as religion is, our attempt to deal with our helplessness (to borrow an epigram of Arthur Darby Nock), and in particular it is our ever-vain search for unity both internal and external. We seek the 70 Cp. Berthelot, CAAG n (1887) 146 Greek, 148 French (= Zosimus 3. 1. 1 ff.) and see Taylor (above, note 2) 128,132-33. Pliny, UN 33. 46. 131 gives the recipe; for discussion see K. C.

The current of this feeling is part (perhaps even one of the chief parts) of the transformation which overwhelmed Mediterranean culture between 180 and 280 A.D.—I mean (with Peter Brown, Alexander Demandt, Hans-Peter L'Orange and Samuel Sambursky) the change from the Classical or Greco-Roman world to the Late Antique world.74 The Late Antique Period runs roughly from 280 to 640 A.D. and is characterised by the ascendancy of the transcendanL One can see this change in all aspects of life—religion (and Christianity did not cause but suffered from this change), philosophy (I need only mention neo Platonism), government (the reforms of Diocletian imposed ca. 285 A.D. laid the foundation of the Middle Ages), architecture (the use of vast internal space in the basilica churches), and art. Perhaps in sculpture it is most clear: though I am not an art historian, I follow L'Orange here. Classical statues and busts are balanced and confident and gaze forthrightly at the viewer; one can sense their humanity. In the famous Delphic Charioteer of the early fifth century B.C. the face is modeled naturally, the lips are parted as if about to speak, the eyes are forward, focused on what must have been the horses. The portraits of Constantine are well known for their Late Antique characteristics and mark in a way the culmination of the trends: note the stark planes of the face, outlined with pure curves at the eyebrows and the face itself suffused with an otherworldly look while the eyes are directed towards heaven. Busts of the second and third centuries A.D. show pure curves in the face; all such seem to portray figures unaware of the viewer or his world. I have tried to convey all too briefly an impression of this overwhelming paradigm shift in the ancient world—alchemy too underwent this shift and transformed from a scientific (if erroneous) search for transmutation into a mystical search for personal transformation. What were the internal roots of this, what background can we find for understanding chemistry as mysticism? Democritus, the pre-Socratic philosopher to whom is attributed the ancient theory of atoms, the same under whose name Bolus wrote, connected the atoms making up the soul with those of fire or of the sun.75 While 74 H.-P.

Yet this particular point was something of a commonplace—Plato in the Timaeus explicitly connects human souls and the stars76 putting them into one-to-one correspondence, while other philosophers including Aristotle put forward hypotheses about the substance of souls and stars such that by the first century B.C. they were more or less equated.77 Hipparchus the great astronomer who discovered the precession of the equinoxes in about 130 B.C. was praised because he proved that the stars are kindred with man and our souls are part of the heavens.78 Instead of being made of this quintessence, the mind or soul could also be thought of as the mixing of the elements or atoms, and the perfection of the soul as the proper mixing or balancing by means of the stellar substance, the quintessence. In any case, the philosophic notion of perfecting the soul was that the soul's true divine nature must be brought out. Plato had already compared the soul to gold in a famous passage in the Symposium (216d-17b)—the soul, that is, of a good man, Socrates. Gold was, since Babylon, the metal of what even Pindar had called the warmest star (Oly. 1. 6)—and most ancient Greeks knew that the stars were fiery. Thus it was only logical—the perfect soul is purified, made heavenly, made golden, as even Pindar in that same Victory Song had sung (Oly. 1. 1). The idea must be nearly universal, as it is even found in the Hebrew Scriptures, in the Psalms, where the Law of God, which perfects the soul, is better than gold, even much fine gold.79 In Proverbs and in the prophets God working on the soul is compared to a refiner seeking to cleanse the noble metal of its dross.80 And this salvation is explicitly compared to purification of gold and silver by fire when Paul writes to the Corinthians:81 "If anyone's work is burned up having been penalised he will be saved, but just as through fire."82 The prevalence of the worship of the Unconquered Sun83—which went so far that Christians adopted the birthday of the Sun (the Winter Solstice) as the birthday of the Son of God—may have had an influence, since the Sun is the planet whose metal is gold. There is also no doubt some original connection to the Golden Age of Hesiod, from which the human race has subsequently declined through Silver (and Copper) to Black 76 Tim. 41-43; see A. E.

Keyser 369 Iron.84 Not surprisingly the alchemists, as had their philosophical forebears, sought to reverse this: black, white silver, yellow gold—and even to outdo it—with the transcending iosis. In any event the transformation happened: what had begun as an experimental science founded on the best scientific thought of the age— Aristotle's four-element theory—became a search for personal transformation. Let me cite some highlights. Zosimus in his vision sees the Man of Copper becoming the Man of Silver and thence the Man of Gold: again immortality is promised to souls capable of entering into the secrets of heaven.85 Contemporary with Zosimus are two alchemical papyri, really recipe books (cited above), and found in a grave with other magical and Gnostic papyri.86 A bit earlier the Christian Bishop Hippolytus had associated alchemical recipes, including that for distilled alcohol, with the magical tricks of the Gnostics. One group of Gnostics is even credited with obtaining gold from bronze.87 Gnosticism was the first successful Christian heresy, in which the essence of salvation lay in learning the secret Gnosis—just as for the alchemist—by which the immortal and spiritual soul could shrug off the merely physical dross of the body and rejoin the purely spiritual Logos.88 Usually this Gnosis is revealed in some vision or ritual—note the vision of Zosimus and the ritual enacted by Bolus to attempt to gain the secret knowledge of his dead master.89 I have already suggested how some of these apparently alchemical ideas are to be found in the New Testament; later Christian thought was also sometimes influenced—in the Martyrdom of Poly carp (15. 2) we read how when he was burned he seemed as if he were gold in the refiner's fire (or bread baking). We may also note the prominence in both Gnosticism and alchemy of the snake Ouroboros. Later we have writers who are explicitly Christian and explicitly alchemists—Stephanus of Alexandria in the seventh century A.D., for example.90 He writes:91 84 Hesiod, W&amp;D 106-210; cp.

What does this mean? Elsewhere Stephanus writes as a Pythagorean (Lecture 2):n "The multitude of numbers compounded together has its existence from one atom and natural monad; this which exerts a mutual tension comprehends and rules over the infinite as emanating from itself. For the monad is so called from its remaining immutable and unmoved. For it displays a circular and spherical contemplation of numbers like to itself, I mean a completion of the five numbers and of the six." And (Lecture l):93 "You the whole are the one nature, the same by which the whole becomes the work. For by an odd number [preferred by the Pythagoreans] thy all cosmos is systematised. For then you shall understand . . . then you shall discover..." and so on. Elsewhere he writes as a Gnostic (Lecture l):94 "Put away the material theory so that you may be deemed worthy to see with your intellectual eyes the hidden mystery. For there is need of a single natural thing and of one nature conquering the all. Of such a kind, now clearly to be told you, that the nature rejoices in the nature and the nature masters the nature and the nature conquers the nature." And he exhorts his hearers to a Christian alchemy (Lecture l):95 "Alone we are made friends with him by Love, and we receive from him the wisdom springing forth as an abyss from the abyss [so a Gnostic would say] that we may be enabled by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to gush forth rivers of living water." The connection is that "copper like a man has both soul and spirit"—air gives us our spirit, fire gives it to the copper. A bit later the poet-philosopher Theophrastus (fort, eighth century A.D.) writes that the object of alchemy is to pour the unchangeable matter from the form of lead into the form of gold—he compares a sculptor working bronze, but I am reminded also of Paul's image in the letter to the 92 Taylor 1937 (above, note 90) 127. 93 Taylor 1937 (above, note 90) 123. 94 Taylor 1937 (above, note 90) 123. 95 Taylor 1937 (above, note 90) 125.</page><page sequence="19">Paul T.

We live in a scientific and post-Christian age, do we not? Not entirely—there is much pseudo-science about, and three great figures were heavily influenced by alchemy: I mean Newton, Goethe and Jung. Newton regarded alchemy as a part of his intellectual life as important as his work on gravitation, and tested recipes for obtaining gold from sulfur and mercury.97 Goethe, though living in the age of Lavoisier and Priestley at the dawn of modern scientific chemistry, believed in alchemy in the sense of obtaining mystical substances with transmutative powers.98 Goethe's belief was that "as Nature works in particular things, so also does she work in universal things," that there is a symmetry in all parts of Nature animated by one Spirit—this is wholly Stoic. Within this there are pairs of polar opposites and the goal of alchemy is to produce an incorruptible permanence embracing all opposites, achieved by a descent to death and corruption, followed by an ascent—the links to ancient (and medieval) alchemy are plain, but all that is left is the magical and mystical aspect. Jung's interest in alchemy and Gnosis extended to the purchase of one of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic codices; in his seventeen volumes of collected works, fully three are devoted to alchemy (only one to the collective unconscious). He translated and commented on the Visions of Zosimus cited above—he connects the symbolism of alchemy and the structure of the unconscious.99 I do not pretend to understand it. All three of these men have influenced our modern world, which itself shows evidence of mankind's continuing fascination with the mystical.100 Not long ago an article appeared in the prestigious scientific journal Nature in which it was claimed that solutions of certain antigen-proteins diluted by such a factor that it was not possible that even one molecule of the protein 96 C.

This "naturopathic" claim was soon refuted (it seems the naturopath on staff had "subconsciously" fudged the statistics), but new naturopathic clinics spring up like mushrooms. Activists oppose the use of animals in research on the grounds that "a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy"—this is a Pythagorean argument. Belief in reincarnation, a cardinal Pythagorean tenet, is widespread (as Herodotus did in another connection, I omit to mention the name of the Californian well known for this). Alchemy, palm-reading, tarot cards and the like are no longer so popular—but "channeling" is, and need I mention that every newspaper feels obliged to publish horoscopes, read religiously by millions? Our age has witnessed the old dream of the alchemists become a reality. Transmutation is possible, and I myself have used one such artificial element in my scientific chemical research—Technetium, element 43, with a half-life of some 200,000 years. It is unnerving, to say the least, to discover that American foreign policy has been directed by astrology in an age enlightened by nuclear fires, fires produced by the transmutation of Uranium (named after the first new planet to be discovered) into Plutonium (named after the third new planet). In such a context the scientific study of ancient alchemy may be very enlightening indeed.
