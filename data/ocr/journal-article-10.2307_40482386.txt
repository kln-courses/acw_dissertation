Kaplan, B.A. içsjy who had a special passion for modern American art Known for his austere paintings of industrial landscapes and urban architecture as well as his poetic watercolors of fruits and flow- ers, Charles Demuth (1883 -1935) was a lead- ing exponent of modernism in America. Although he produced most of his work in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a trip to New Haven, Connecticut, takes the visitor on a journey through his intimate world of artistic creation. That journey is made possible by the generosity of Dr. and Mrs. William R. Hill, who gave their collec- tion of Demuths working drawings to the Yale University Art Gallery in 1995 in loving memory of her uncle, Richard Weyand, to be used as a teaching resource for students, scholars, and artists. Mrs. Hill inherited the collection through her uncle, who, begin- ning in the 1930s, lived with Demuths life- long friend, Robert Locher, a stage designer and decorative artist. Demuth, who died from diabetes at age fifty-one, had willed his drawings and watercolors to Locher. At the death of Demuths mother, Locher- in further testament to Demuths great affec- tion for him - also inherited the patrician eighteenth-century family townhouse where the artist had created most of his work. Locher and Weyand converted part of it into an antiques store, and Weyand undertook the task of documenting Demuths life, writing, and art. Portions of Weyand s cata- logue raisonné and scrapbooks are now in the Collection of American Literature at Yale s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, which also houses Demuths corre- spondence with avant-garde artists, writers, and theater personalities as well as four of his paintings donated by his close friend Geor- gia O'Keeffe.1 Therefore, the Hill collection adds to the wealth of material already at Yale, including watercolor masterworks at the Gallery, making the University a center for the study of Demuth s life and art. Unprecedented insight into Demuths creative process can be gleaned from looking through the Hill collection, comprising forty-two drawings and watercolors in vari- ous stages of completion. Many are fragile, small sketches; some are of true distinction. As a group, the works prove that Demuths reputation can afford scrutiny of even his slightest sketches, for they reveal his master- ful touch and witty personality. The draw- ings encompass a wide range of subjects - still lifes of flowers, fruits, and vegetables; figurai drawings of sailors, sunbathers, and vaudeville entertainers; Cubist-inspired landscapes; and studies for major paint- ings - and span his entire career. In this 75</page><page sequence="3">article, a small selection of gems from that treasure trove will illuminate moments in his artistic journey. Born in Lancaster into a financially com- fortable family, Demuth was lame since childhood, possibly the result of poliomyelitis. He remained a prolific artist despite restric- tions caused by illness throughout his life. Charming works in the Hill collection, including an academic ink-wash portrait probably depicting the artist's father and a watercolor of a girl pulling a wagon that evokes personality through pose, were made during his student days.2 In 1905 Demuth entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he studied first with Thomas Anschutz, then with William Mer- ritt Chase, and saw the works of renowned nineteenth-century realist Thomas Eakins. In 1907 Demuth interrupted his studies to travel in Europe, where he developed an appreciation for modernism, especially the art of Paul Cézanne. He returned to Phila- delphia but made frequent excursions into New York City. Charles Daniel, who pro- moted American modernists like Man Ray, Stuart Davis, and Max Weber, championed Demuths work. Around 1909, he also began frequenting Alfred Stieglitz s 291 gallery, although the legendary dealer-photographer did not represent him until later. In 1910, Demuth saw Stieglitz's exhibi- tion of drawings by the celebrated but con- troversial French master Auguste Rodin, whose sexually frank drawings shocked some critics. Those drawings continued to inspire Demuth when he returned to Paris in 1912. With a sensuality reminiscent of Rodin but with less feeling for feminine beauty, Demuth created a watercolor of a female nude (fig. 1), probably during a drawing ses- sion at the Académie Moderne. Following a teaching methodology developed by Rodin's assistant, Antoine Bourdelle, students made sketches from models who changed poses every five minutes.3 In response, Demuth filled the page- with the models extremities running off the sheet on three sides, as if the confines of the paper could not contain her energy. He captured her fluid contour with a calligraphic pencil line, added quick circles for the belly, right breast, and head, and then applied an amorphous wash. The model's frontal stance with spread legs revealing black pubic hair represents a departure from the restrained representations of the female nude made by most American artists. This appropriation of Rodin s brazen approach to erotic subjects and the technique of applying wash over a graphite outline would continue to characterize Demuths watercolors. But his touch would become increasingly confident. Demuths watercolor of boys bathing (fig. i)4 also reveals his search for inspiration in art, for it does not derive from observation of an actual scene but rather from images of nude male bathers by Eakins and Cézanne. In Demuths watercolor, the rhythmic stand- ing, lying, diving, swimming nudes carry your eye across the page as if on rippling waves. The emphasis on the flat patterning of bodies against land, water, and sky recalls Cezanne's large-plate colored lithograph of The Bathers (National Gallery of Art, Wash- ington, D.C.) that was exhibited at 291 in 1910.5 But Demuth never aspired to the master's monumentality in figurai composi- tions and had not yet adopted his modern aesthetic of emphasizing geometric forms in nature and leaving untouched areas of paper to serve as compositional elements, as he would in later landscapes and still lifes (see page 74 and figs. 5 and 12). Beginning around 191 5, Demuth pro- duced figurai compositions drawn from circus and vaudeville acts, which he saw in both New York and Lancaster, where per- formers regularly debuted before moving to larger markets. A sensual undercurrent, evident in Demuth's Rodinesque watercolor of a model, runs through these images. In Vaudeville Dancer (fig. 3)/ he records a woman wearing the mask-like grin put on to engage an audience. His line, which curls back on itself, indicates that he drew rapidly from the figure in motion - as Rodin often 76</page><page sequence="4">Fig. i. Charles Demuth, Female Nude, ca. 1912.

The elastic body, composed of interconnected ovals, conveys the fluidity of kinetic motion. He places the dancer in the center of the page, the equivalent of center stage, with her high kicking leg shooting off to the right - constructing a distinctly modern balance of object and space. In finished watercolors of dancers, Demuth usually spotlighted the star performer s cen- trality, echoed her energy in the movements of background chorus figures, and floated saturated washes over the pencil line, blot- ting some colors while letting others run into one another with a restless vitality that embodied the frantic rhythms of the great American vaudeville tradition. The artist, who loved theater and aspired to be a writer, subtitled one of his plays '"You Must Come Over/ A Painting: A Play," which exalts actors in musical reviews as practitioners of a quintessentially modern American art form. One of his characters declares: "But I love Broadway and . . . vul- garity, and gin. In fact I love my country." Demuth used "You Must Come Over," the catch phrase of a female impersonator who garnered acclaim in vaudeville, in the sense of an American inviting a European to visit this country. His close friend Marsden Hartley shared his belief that vaudeville deserved to be regarded as an art form, and he defined it as such: "I do not know why I think of vaudeville as I think of a collection of good drawings. Unless it is because the sense of form is the same in all the arts."9 While working with Hartley in Bermuda and Provincetown in 1916 and 1917, Demuth turned his attention to Cubist-inspired landscape abstractions. Those abstractions evolved from naturalistic renderings of trees in which he exploits the flow of pigment by pooling color in the ripples of the sketchpad paper, giving texture to form (fig. 4).10 Soon after seeing Cézanne s depictions of rooftops and trees at the Montross Gallery in New York in 1916, Demuth similarly suspended fragments of architecture and nature in a shallow space in watercolors like Red Chim- neys (fig. 5). He used pencil lines to define roofs, walls, chimneys, and branches, con- centrating all the energy in the center, with no lines reaching the edges of the sheet. This strategy gives explosive punch to his composition; tree branches and buildings, in a melding of organic and linear forms, intersect with centrifugal force, then dissi- pate as they radiate outward. Demuths process mirrors the way flower buds develop; his image unfurls from the center to create a perfect balance of geometry and organic vitality. That same approach energizes his still lifes of the 1920s (see page 74 and fig. 12). In 1920, Demuth was diagnosed with severe diabetes. In January 1921 he confided to Stieglitz: "most of the time, well, I'm not up to doing very much about anything. Will see you I hope some time soon when things are more or less - more or less - God knows what."11 That August he left on what would prove to be his last trip to Europe, but failing health compelled him to return early. During his voyage home on board the Paris in November 1921, he made at least five tiny sketches on ships stationary of the monu- mental steamship; the most finished is in the Hill collection (fig. 6).12 In it, he focused on a narrow slice of the ship, collapsed depth into a linear geometric pattern by applying grids similar to those in his landscape abstrac- tions, and selected a provocative phallic form, the tall funnel, as the compositional anchor. In the painting, he intensified the horizontals at the bottom and the echoing curves throughout, fashioning a synthesis of European abstraction, American realism, and personal vision (fig. 7). The study already contains the sharp-edged, simplified forms that are the hallmark of Precisionism.13 Demuth's focus on a phallic funnel may be understood not only in the personal context of his homosexuality but also in the public arena of the avant-gardes candid punning on male genitalia14 and ambivalent fascina- tion with machinery as emblematic of viril- ity. Sadly, his voyage cut short, Demuth 78</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4. Charles Demuth, Tree, sketch #27 from Charles Demuths Sketchbook, ca. 19 17.

In June 1922 he entered a sanatorium in Morristown, New Jersey, where he endured Dr. Aliens starvation diet, a common but not promising treatment for diabetics. Shortly after his eyesight began to fail, Demuth became one of the first people in the United States to receive experimental insulin treat- ments, which he regarded as "a sort of trick. I feel, - I will wake, - it is not possible."15 In 1923, he commenced his poster portrait series as farewells to his friends when he believed he might soon die. The poster portraits improbably wedded the accessible boldness of advertising with the elusive symbolism of emblematic portraiture. They served to affirm both his professional and personal ties to those artists, writers, and theater personal- ities who shared his ambition to create a dis- tinctly American modernism.16 Poster Portrait: Dove (fig. 8) is set out- doors, an appropriate format for fellow Stieglitz-circle artist Arthur Dove, whose abstractions were based on natural forms. The land, water, sickle, grapes, and cone- form symbolize both the American soils and Dove s fertile output, for he was a farmer as well as an artist. Four studies for Dove in the Hill collection offer insight into the develop- ment and meaning of Demuth's painting. He began with an arc, a form predominant in Dove's abstractions, then placed it on a ground line, transformed the arc into a sickle by adding a handle and, in the fourth study (fig. 9), added a cone-like form and grapes whose shapes echo the oblong and round shapes favored by Dove in his own art.17 The sickle, emblematic of farming, was also recognizable at the time as a symbol for the Workers' Party. Here, the sickle underscores Demuth's admiration for Dove's abstract art, which was lauded as "revolutionary" in a special 1913 issue of Stieglitz's magazine Camera Work.1* Surprisingly, Demuth's private drawing discloses an unflattering view of Dove, later suppressed in the public painting. Their friendship faltered in 1921 when artist Helen Torr, the wife of cartoonist Clive Weed, one of Demuth's best friends from his student days at the Pennsylvania Academy, left her husband for Dove.19 A sickle is used to cut down - or castrate - tall weeds, such as the one depicted at the left in the study, a refer- ence to Weed. Tied around the sickle's handle, the ribbon, painted red in the final portrait, refers to auburn-haired Helen, nicknamed "Reds." What scholars have usu- ally interpreted as a cone is, in fact, hops, a collection of cone-like seeds used to brew beer.20 The grapes and hops together evoke the homemade wine and beer made by Dove for gatherings of friends. But the phallic hops also may be interpreted as a condem- nation of Dove's behavior toward Weed: the scientific name for hops, Lupulus, is the Latin diminutive for wolfi an allusion to the plant's ability to smother other plants, like the weed in Demuth's drawing that hops, like a botanized wolf, would devour.21 Completed after the homages to painters in the Stieglitz circle, Calla Lilies (fig. 10) is the first poster portrait that does not boldly announce the name of the subject. Those in the know would have recognized this figure as vaudevillian Bert Savoy,22 "the greatest female impersonator the stage has ever known," who was killed instantly by a bolt of lightning at Long Beach, New York, on June 26, 1923.23 Demuth's portrayal of the calla lilies reveals the anthropomorphic qual- ities inherent in their forms: curved stems sway at the "hip," the leaves are held high in a gesture suggesting the pose of the late vaudevillian in promotional photographs. Calla lilies are an appropriate symbol for someone gifted in the art of gender disguise, for the trumpet-like spathe serves as femi- nine clothing concealing the plant's phallic reproductive organ. Demuth depicts the lilies in three stages of "undress." The windswept flowers are tossed diagonally across a blue void, a reminder of Savoy's death at Long Beach. 81</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 8.

Gift of Dr. and Mrs. William R. Hill in memory of Richard Weyand. 1995.51.7 Comparing the drawing to the painting reveals a change of mind: Demuth signifi- cantly altered the shell's form. O'Keeffe later identified it as "a beautiful shell" given to her by "one of his girl friends . . . because she knew he had always wanted it, and she wanted him to see that she gave it to me."24 For his portrait of Savoy, whose cross-dress- ing performance articulates fantasies about mingling genders, Demuth appropriately selected a shell whose history links it to a woman whom both he, a homosexual, and O'Keeffe, a bisexual, found attractive at some level. Simultaneously, Demuth made a visual pun, for the shell, with its bluish tinge and crimped, crisp outer leaves, resembles a vegetable - Savoy cabbage.25 Demuth's paint- ing, like Savoy's art of impersonation, both discloses and withholds information, forcing us to wonder about the enigmatic relation- ship between seeing and knowing. Conceal- ment and revelation - that is what Demuth's poster portraits are all about. And the draw- ings for them in the Hill collection unveil hidden meanings. In the 1920s, Demuth produced his poster portraits for an inner circle. Outsiders complained that they were written "in a code for which we have not the key";2 conversely, some insiders found his still life watercolors suspect because, unlike his posters, the public understood them and they sold relatively well. Nonetheless, in the balance of object to ground and realism to abstraction, Demuth's watercolors of the 1920s remain potent modernist statements in which he brought a personal adaptation of Cubism, seen in Red Chimneys, Paquebot "Paris" and Poster Portrait: Dove, to expres- sive arrangements of flowers and fruit. Unfinished watercolors like Tomato and Red Pepper (fig. 12) 27 clarify the technical 84</page><page sequence="12">processes that make Demuths masterworks appear effortless. By this time, he had received acclaim for his watercolors of flow- ers and began experimenting with still lifes composed exclusively of fruits and vegeta- bles. He centers the pepper and then moves outward, constructing his composition as he did in Red Chimneys (see fig. 5). Tomato and Red Pepper is notable for the conviction with which he silhouettes the forms with an eco- nomical pencil line, then suggests modeling with the simplest of means by employing facets of crystalline red watercolor. In the virtuoso Green Pears (page 74), 28 Demuth set for himself the same challenge: to maintain a limited color range while building form only with those colors rather than with tone. Like the reds in Tomato and Red Pepper, the varied greens glow with reflective light. He organizes elements from the center outward with a strong sense of pattern within a shallow space, underpin- ning the composition with immaculate pencil lines, then laying down watercolor washes of nuanced planes, suggesting rounded forms through a faceted blotting of wash. The tables surface consists only of untouched paper on which the bowl and pears cast transparent shadows. Demuths pencil lines against untouched paper heighten awareness of the means he uses to achieve his art, engaging the viewer in a perpetual act of creation. Green Pears was among the watercolors featured in exhibitions organized by Stieglitz in the 1920s and '30s at The Intimate Gallery and An American Place. It is austere, with a starkness and monumentality comparable to Demuth's paintings of industrial landscapes from the same period. Yet even his stripped- down compositions like Green Pears retain a theatrical personality, a figurai aura. The harsh lighting and shallow space evoke a stage set, with the central pear, elevated above the chorus on an overturned plate, the star performer. The quirky shape of the pears stem and leaf serve as a kind of costume. The Hill collection includes one of sev- eral versions of a costume Demuth designed "after Beardsley" for his wealthy Lancaster friend Blanche Steinman (fig. 13). 29 Like the best of Demuth s large watercolors, such as Green Pears, this small, rhythmic contour drawing is marked by restraint. Every nuance counts - from the placement just to the right of center, to the figure's slight upward tilt. Demuth transformed the bodice into a face mask. Because he was preoccupied with con- cealment and revelation, he used masks in stories, illustrations, scenes of nightlife and vaudeville, and in costume scenes for masked balls, popular in the 1920s. As we have seen, during that time Demuth was dedicating most of his energies to the creation of his poster portraits, in which masks figure prominently. The last portrait in the series, Love, Love, Love (Fundación Colección Thyssen- Bornemisza), is conventionally known as an homage to Gertrude Stein but probably was intended for Robert Locher, to whom Demuth gave the painting after its exhibi- tion at Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery in 1929.30 This theatrical poster with a half-mask would be appropriate for Locher, an illustra- tor and stage designer who not only used masks in his costumes and illustrations but also incorporated a half-mask into his signa- ture. In 1930, after Locher had begun a rela- tionship with the younger Richard Weyand, Demuth confided to Stieglitz that he was ill and that "something else happened to me which almost finished me in another direc- tion."31 In the poster, the severe cropping of LOVE, its threefold repetition, and the shift- ing diagonal division of the color fields may allude to this developing situation. Around this time Demuth returned to his circus and vaudeville theme to draw a juggler at rest (fig. 14). Although he never stamped it, he folded the paper to be mailed to his friend "G.O'K" - Georgia O'Keeffe - enhancing its personal significance; in pen on the reverse, he addressed it to her at Marie Garland s H &amp; M Ranch, where she stayed in 1930, 1931, 1934, and 1935.32 Using 85</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 13.

The stationary man, who holds a ball, is either waiting to juggle or has just exited the stage. His meditative expression recalls that of psychologically unmasked clowns by Antoine Watteau, whose painting Gilles appears on the easel in Demuth s portrait of the lonely eighteenth- century artist in an illustration for Walter Pater's "A Prince of Court Painters." The closing lines of that literary portrait articu- late Demuths self-identification with Wat- teau and his alter-ego performers: "He had been a sick man all his life. He was always a seeker after something in the world that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all."33 Numerous contemporaries described Demuth, who often chose to conceal his homosexuality and the seriousness of his dia- betes, as secretive. No artist made more of an effort to get behind his mask than O'Keeffe, who made frequent excursions to Lancaster when Demuth was confined there by illness. 86 13 h</page><page sequence="14">15 i6 */ A mutual friend recalled: "Georgia adored Demuth. I always thought this was because she and Demuth were very much alike. Geor- gia is an introvert. She is a wonderful person, but very hard to get to know, just as he was."34 That empathy would have contributed to O'Keeffe's understanding of Demuths bond with performers skilled at hiding their true selves, like this solemn juggler. The protagonist in many of Demuth s stories, preserved by Weyand, is a homosex- ual artist or writer, an outside observer, a witness to other people's happiness who finds solace in creativity. In an epigram, Demuth asserts that it is only when "the individual needs something beyond sex, direct or indirect, [that] he is likely to create."35 In his last years, marred by debil- itating bouts of diabetes and the loss of Locher to Weyand, art offered Demuth "something beyond sex" as his drawings became sublimated expressions of desire. His repetition of groups of three people competing for attention in images spiked 87</page><page sequence="15">with homosexual innuendo may have auto- biographical roots. The sailor depicted on the right in this sketch (fig. 15) appears in others (see figs. 16 and 17). 36 In Three Figures, he is the object of a longing gaze, cast at his crotch by the central, androgynous character. The oblivious sailor, with a hand confidently on his hip, engages the woman across from him. The feet squeezed onto the paper at bottom mar this otherwise observant record- ing of body language. Demuth used a more assured contour drawing as the template for On "That" Street, a watercolor in which he adds background allusions to Sands Street, a site for homosex- ual cruising near the Brooklyn Navy Yard (figs. 16 and 17). 37 The study includes two of the three figures - with the disembodied, jaunty oval of a sailors hat reserving a place for the third. In the finished scene showing a fashionable man picking up two sailors, the inward postures convey secrecy. The central man rests his weight on one leg and leans as if holding a cane in his unseen hand. Demuth used a cane as a personal emblem in many watercolors, and in a memorial tribute to him, Hartley recalled the way his elegant friend so successfully integrated his lameness with his sense of style that his cane contributed to his identity.38 Although Demuth devoted most of his depleted strength to making watercolors, three studies in a sketchbook in the Hill col- lection reveal that he exerted precious effort planning After AlU his final work in oil and his last major architectural painting (figs. 18 and 19). 39 Based on Lancaster's Armstrong Cork Company complex,40 the studies docu- ment his successive recording and rearrang- ing of factory buildings with numerous windows, fire escapes, pipes, power lines, smokestacks, and, at the lower right, a cyclone separator.41 The artist scribbled occasional color notes - "white," "red," "black," or "white edge" - that correspond to his final choices, with the exception of "black" inscribed in the right corner of the most finished study where a diagonal of white appears in the painting. Demuth made only one significant compositional change: he moved a double-sided light or siren atop a pole, placed near the center against the sky in the sketch, to the left against the building in the painting, giving greater prominence to more monolithic verticals of buildings and smokestacks. Enigmatic titles serve as signposts to meaning in Demuth s work. After All derives from Walt Whitman's poem in Leaves of Grass: After all not to create only, or found only, But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded, To give our own identity, average, limit- less, free, To fill the gross, the torpid bulk with vital religious fire, Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate, To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead, These are also the lessons of our New World; While how little the New after all, how much the Old, Old World!42 While neither celebrating nor condemn- ing his hometown's industrial architecture, Demuth recognizes the factory as a national icon of modernity by endowing it with the importance of a religious structure through compositional devices: the elevated vantage point above the street and the verticals tow- ering like spires against a sky punctuated by force lines resembling beacons of light. He reiterates Whitmans homage to the New World as derived from the Old, but marked with our own identity, made in America. Despite the barren cultural landscape for avant-garde artists, Demuth embraced his American identity: "What work I do will be done here; terrible as it is to work in this 'our land of the free.' . . . Together we will add to the American scene. ... I feel that all together we are more or less fine."43 This 88</page><page sequence="16">Fig. i8.

On hear- ing the news that one of his works had been accepted into the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with characteristic grace Demuth told Stieglitz and O'Keeffe that others deserved the honor more. He closed his letter with the refrain: "Love,- Yes, I send you both that, it is all we really have, - after all, - "44 In affec- tionate farewells to friends and in the title of a final painting, Demuth's "after all" carries the hope that through their shared quest for a modern American art, they would endure. Demuth continued to work almost to the end, producing his last known sketches during the summer of 1934 on a final visit to Provincetown, where he stayed in the vacation home of Lancaster friends, Frank and Elsie Everts. One late beach scene is undoubtedly a self-portrait, for the topless artists body is slightly deformed (fig. 20). 45 On the horizon, sailboats evoke Demuth's longing for freedom from physical con- straints as well as his journey through life and art. With pants rolled up above the knees, the fictional artist sits with a palette before him and holds a watercolor brush aimed at the blank sheet, propped against the piers of a wharf. The fictional sheet mimics the rectangular shape of the real one. A paint box and brushes rest in the lower left corner. With these tools, Demuth created a protean range of subjects in a distinctive modern style that defies easy categorization. In 1950, before Weyand s death scattered Demuth's unsold drawings and watercolors, Andrew Ritchie organized a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Ritchie, who would later become director of the Yale University Art Gallery, showed sketches alongside masterpieces. His words, written more than half a century ago, anticipate the value of the Hill collection coming to Yale: "Here, then, is an artist who has left us as rich and varied a mine of subject matter as any modern American I can think of. Yet all of it is of a piece and in all of it one can trace the growth of [Demuth's] personal style and the influences that helped to form it."46 90</page><page sequence="18">Weyand inscribed numbers on Demuths works that correspond to his catalogue raisonné. Listed in these notes are Weyand s numbers preceded by the initial W, followed by the notebook number if the catalogue entry is now located at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Also listed are numbers subse- quently given to works by Emily Farnham (hereafter F) in "Charles Demuth: His Life, Psychology, and Works," PH.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 1959, vol. 2; works on paper listings commence on p. 695. 1. Demuth willed his unsold paintings to O'Keeffe. In addition to receiving Demuths unsold drawings at his death, five years later, Locher received Demuths sketchbooks as a gift from Augusta Demuth, the artist s mother. Locher died in 1956, leaving Demuths works to Weyand, who died soon after, intestate. After Weyand s death, Demuths works, along with Weyand s catalogue and scrapbooks about the artist, were divided into four parts and distributed to Weyand s siblings. Dorothy Weyand Grether, Mrs. William R. Hill's (Ann Grether) mother, inherited some of Demuths works on paper, most of which the Hills gave to the Yale University Art Gallery in 1995. Mrs. Hill also gave the sections of Weyand s catalogue and scrapbooks belonging to her and to her sister Louisa Weyand White to the Yale Collection of Amer- ican Literature (hereafter YCAL) at Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library; the portions belonging to their two brothers remain unlocated. On October 16, 1957, Parke-Bernet, New York, sold eighty-three works by Demuth from the Weyand estate; a second sale from the same estate of eighty-six works was held on February 5, 1958; Sotheby Parke Bernet held a third sale of fifty-four works on October 28, 1976. On the disposition of Demuths works, excluding those at Yale, see Sanford Schwartz, "Auctions: Glimpsing the Hidden Demuth," Art in America 64 (October 1976) : 102-3. 2. W804, Notebook 5, YCAL, entitled by Weyand Man with Derby Hat, was identified by Mrs. Hill as a portrait of the artists father and resembles pho- tographs of him; it may be dated ca. 1907. The draw- ing of a girl, signed "CD. 1910," corresponds to W805, Notebook 5, YCAL, and F185; Farnham identifies the subject as "one of the Lancaster County Plain people." Alvord L. Eiseman ("A Study of the Development of an Artist," ph.d. dissertation, New York University, 1976, p. 68 and plate 41) states that the drawing shows that Demuth was "neither stylisti- cally or conceptually more than a student." I thank Mrs. William R. Hill and appraiser Marcia R. Rosen- thai for sharing thoughts on the Hill collection at the time of its acquisition in 1995. 3. W107. Weyand Appendix 322, YCAL, compares three photos of Demuth s nudes from this period, with 107 being the least delicate and most forthright. A comparative example is described by Demuths friend Laetitia H. Malone (W633, Notebook 5, YCAL) as "a slight line drawing touched up with watercolor, a nude done in the methods of Rodin's drawings which Charlie did when we were in Paris ... in a quick lose life class." On Rodin, see Barbara Haskell, Charles Demuth) exhibition catalogue (New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1987), 27-29. My place- ment of works in the Hill collection into Demuths life and oeuvre draws on primary sources and the reconstruction of his development by Haskell and other scholars; for a selected bibliography of the extensive Demuth literature, see Haskell, Charles Demuth, 237-40.

This drawing is the template for at least two watercolors that Demuth gave to Blanche Stein- man for a "Black and White Ball," as catalogued by Weyand: W522-23, Notebook 4, YCAL; a version is reproduced in Haskell, Charles Demuth, 199. 30.

Demuth to Stieglitz, October 12, 1930, YCAL; Haskell, Charles Demuth, 204, interpreted the "some- thing else" as a possible reference to Lochers involve- ment with Weyand. Alvord L. Eiseman {Charles Demuth [New York: Watson Guptill Publications, 1982], 23) wrote: "Demuth's relationship with Robert Locher was an example of his devout loyalty and complete discreetness. Although the relationship was known in Lancaster, it was seldom discussed." Until the early 1930s, Locher was married to Beatrice Howard, although this was allegedly a marriage of convenience. 32.
