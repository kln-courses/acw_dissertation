MUSEUMS AND FIRST PEOPLES IN CANADA (1) Anita Herle, Assistant Curator (Anthropology) Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology In 1992 a Canadian Task Force, set up in collaboration between the Assembly of First Nations and the Canadian Museums Association, published its Report on Museums and First Peoples (2). This paper will look at the background to the Task Force, outline the contents of the report and discuss some recent collaborative projects between museums and First Peoples. My information is based on a series of interviews conducted in 1992 with Native and non-Native museum professionals who were members of the Task Force, arti- cles in the Canadian national press and specialist journals, and informal discussions with former colleagues. While the material on which this article is based is not comprehensive, it provides a good overview of the current situation and includes activities of civic, provincial, university, national and Indigenous museums in four provinces. The Context: The Spirit Sings Individual museums in Canada have been strengthening their relation- ships with First Nations communities for many years. However, these issues have only recently become formalised within a national frame- work. The impetus for setting up a Task Force on Museums and First Peoples was the Lubicon Cree boycott of The Spirit Sings, an exhibi- tion organised by the Glenbow Museum in Calgary to coincide with the 1988 Winter Olympics. The boycott was not specifically aimed at the content of the exhibition but at its main sponsor, Shell Oil. At the time the Lubicon were involved in a land dispute with the Canadian government and Shell was extracting oil from land claimed by the Lubicon. The Lubicon people lobbied museums around the world, including several British museums, to boycott The Spirit Sings by 39</page><page sequence="2">Anita Herle withholding artefacts from the show. At the same time, Treaty Seven Indians, whose traditional territory includes Calgary, participated in both the Olympics and the exhibition while supporting the Lubicon land claim. Nevertheless, approximately 10% of the lending institu- tions withdrew their support for the exhibition. When the Spirit Sings opened there were protests and pickets outside the Glenbow Museum and at several museums and galleries across Canada. Numerous debates both within the museum profession and between museums and various First Nations groups arose out of this confrontation. The debate was covered widely in the national press. Fuelled by pub- licity, the confrontation over The Spirit Sings brought into the open important issues which had been simmering for some time about the relationship between museums and First Peoples in Canada. When the exhibition moved to Canada's capital city Ottawa, George Erasmus, the then National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations (hereafter AFN), invited George Macdonald, director of the Canadian Museum of Civilization (hereafter CMC), to co-sponsor a symposium. It was the vision of George Erasmus that prompted a cooperative approach to the issue. The Spirit Sings exhibition sparked a fair amount of controversy in Canada. It raised questions that museums had to deal with and a lot of questions that Native people had to address ... What kind of role should Native people play in the presentation of their own past, their own his- tory? ... When the exhibition came to Ottawa we had to ask the indige- nous community what we were going to do. We could have continued with the boycott. But we needed to get beyond that. What we are embarking on now is the beginning of a different kind of relationship between two potentially strong allies (Foreword, Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, Ottawa 1992). Following an initial working session between museum and Aboriginal representatives it was decided that the Canadian Museums Association (hereafter CMA) and the AFN should organise a national conference. In November 1988 "Preserving Our Heritage: A Working Conference Between Museums and First Peoples" was held at Carleton University in Ottawa. A consensus was reached among 150 participants at the con- ference about the need to establish a task force. The task force's mis- sion statement was "to develop an ethical framework and strategies for 40</page><page sequence="3">Museums and First Peoples in Canada Aboriginal nations to represent their history and culture in concert with cultural institutions" (ibid). Consultations and discussions were held with numerous representa- tives of Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal museums, cultural institutions, special interest groups and Native elders. The task force had 25 mem- bers who worked within three regional committees. Tom Hill, Director of the Woodlands Cultural Centre on the Six Nations Indian reserve, and Trudy Nicks, Ethnography Curator at the Royal Ontario Museum, were appointed as co-chairs. Each regional committee held several meetings and consulted directly with concerned institutions and individ- uals. Over 4000 invitations to make submissions on the issues were dis- tributed. The draft report of the Task Force was submitted in November 1991 and subsequently passed by the Council of CMA and the Special Chiefs Assembly. The final report, entitled Turning the Page: Forging New Partnerships Between Museums and First Peoples, was published in 1992 and widely distributed to Canadian museums and Indigenous community organisations. Principles and Recommendations of the Task Force The Task Force Report recommendations are not statutory, but provide a framework for negotiations between museums and Indigenous people within Canada. In many cases the report summarises the current best practices of individual museums and their relationships with First Peoples. However, some of the recommendations represent a major challenge to current museological practice. As there is no comparable document for museums in the UK, it will be useful to summarise the main points in some detail. The beginning of the Task Force Report lays out a number of princi- ples considered crucial to the creation of partnerships. It acknowledges the historical roots of inequality and urges museums and First Peoples to work together to remedy the current situation. The importance of First Peoples being allowed to speak for themselves is emphasised, yet the report also recognises the skills and expertise of museum profes- sionals. 41</page><page sequence="4">Anita Herle An equal partnership involves mutual appreciation of the conceptual knowledge and approaches characteristic of First Peoples, and the empirical knowledge and approaches of academically-trained workers (ibid:7). The report recognises that First Peoples and museums have mutual interests in cultural materials and related knowledge concerning the past, present and future. Partnerships are advocated in all areas of museum activity concerned with Native heritage, including the collec- tion, documentation, interpretation and exhibition of Native artefacts and associated public and educational programming. First Peoples are not satisfied merely with assisting in ongoing museum projects: true partnerships must include the participation of First Peoples in the devel- opment of policies and funding programmes. The specific recommendations to establish these partnerships focus on three major areas: interpretation, access and repatriation. Interpretation includes the involvement of First Peoples in processes of planning, research, presentation and maintenance of all exhibitions and projects that include Aboriginal cultures. The inclusion of Aboriginal languages in documentation and display is recommended. Access includes improving the opportunities to view collections in store and related documentation. With the assistance of First Peoples, museums are encouraged to develop a process whereby all information related to Native collections is disclosed, including the means of acqui- sition. At the same time it is noted that Aboriginal peoples should respect the concerns of museum professionals regarding collections management and preservation. The report also stresses the importance of access to employment at all levels within museums, including the participation of First Peoples on governing committees or boards of directors, in order to ensure the adequate representation of Indigenous heritage. Art museums are encouraged to work with First Peoples artists to enhance their collections of contemporary art. A more detailed section on repatriation is divided into three areas of concern: human remains, objects of cultural patrimony, and the repatria- tion of foreign holdings. Human remains of individuals remembered by name and remains which are affiliated with a named First People are to be reported to that Nation, tribe, clan or family. In addition, the treatment and disposition of remains and associated burial objects that cannot be 42</page><page sequence="5">Museums and First Peoples in Canada affiliated with a named group should be decided through negotiation with an advisory committee of First Peoples. The report neither guarantees nor rules out the possibility of scientific research on human remains in specif- ic instances. "The First People may work with scientific interests for a mutually agreed upon time period and may have the remains re-interred in a manner consistent with local traditional practices" (ibid:9). With regard to objects of cultural patrimony the report recommends that "the treatment, use, presentation and disposition of sacred and cere- monial objects should be decided on moral and ethical grounds with the involvement of First Nations as equal partners" (ibid:9). It calls for restitution for anything that was acquired illegally, as judged by current legal standards. Even when artefacts have been acquired legally, muse- ums are encouraged to consider requests for the transfer of title for sacred and ceremonial objects as well as all objects which have an ongoing importance to an indigenous community. An alternative to transfer of title is to loan specific sacred and ceremonial objects for use in traditional ceremonies, provided an agreement is reached regarding the conditions and length of loan. Important objects may be replicated either for repatriation or retention. Finally, museums are encouraged to share the management of cultural property by involving the appropriate First Peoples. This includes defining access to collections and determin- ing their use and storage conditions. In the event of disputes between Native individuals, individuals and communities or between communities, the onus should be on First Nations to resolve the dispute according to customary practice. The report urges both the CMC and the AFN to promote the repatria- tion of human remains and objects of cultural patrimony in foreign holdings subject to the recommendations outlined for such artefacts within Canadian museums. Requests for repatriation will be strength- ened by lobbying national governments, UNESCO, ICOM and other professional associations. The importance of professional and technical training initiatives is essential to the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force. The report urges that funding be provided by the Federal govern- ment to promote educational programmes. Training for First Peoples must be provided in a culturally appropriate manner with priority given to funding programmes controlled by First Peoples. Cultural knowledge 43</page><page sequence="6">Anita Herle held by Indigenous individuals should be acknowledged as legitimate. In addition, there needs to be increased training for non- Aboriginal peo- ples in Aboriginal cultural knowledge and approaches. The final recommendations of the Task Force Report address imple- mentation. The Federal government is urged to allocate special funding over five years to assist with the recommendations of the Task Force and to study ongoing financial needs beyond the five year period. It is noted that special funding will be needed for numerous projects related to the development and implementation of the Task Force guidelines. These include training, museum internships, improving documentation and compiling inventories, supporting collaborative projects and assist- ing in repatriation negotiations. Finally, it is recommended that a joint committee be set up to monitor the implementation of principles and recommendations . Despite the guidelines set out by the Task Force, there are numerous specific issues, particularly those regarding repatriation, which are to be resolved by negotiations based on moral and ethical factors (emphasis mine). These negotiations "are to be guided by traditional knowledge and authority of First Peoples as well as scientific knowledge of academically-trained museum personnel" (ibid:9). While one welcomes the equal weight given to distinct value systems (3), it is inevitable that these systems will occasionally collide. Most curators welcome increased access, but it has serious implica- tions in terms of funding, collections management, staffing and conser- vation. Lack of documentation often makes it difficult to ascertain vil- lage and tribal affiliations. In addition to assisting First Peoples go through catalogue records or view pieces in store, increased access involves active encouragement of Indigenous people's involvement with museums; it means going to remote communities to talk to elders. As one curator from a multidisciplinary museum said in interview, "it took a while for my director to understand that it was important for me to drive 200 miles to have a cup of coffee". Access may include the loan of sacred material to community leaders for ritual occasions. In other cases Indigenous representatives may take care of an object's spiritual needs within the context of the museum. For example, the false face masks at CMC are periodically ritually fed. CMC is now building up a living history collection which is acces- 44</page><page sequence="7">Museums and First Peoples in Canada sioned separately from the main ethnography collection. The living his- tory collection includes items that are intended occasionally to be lent back to their communities of origin. Perhaps ironically, increased access by First Peoples will result in the restriction of general access to sacred materials. For many museum professionals "repatriation" is the R word. Curators are nervous about the possibility of losing the very collections which provide the basis for research and for the existence of the muse- um itself. However, with the exception of human remains, many of which have been repatriated, to date CMC and other museums have had relatively few requests for repatriation. Exceptions include grave goods and specific pieces taken from known owners under the auspices of the anti-potlatch law. The most notable example occurred in 1978 when the then National Museum of Canada (now CMC) repatriated material seized in 1922 after a potlatch hosted by Dan Crammer (4). The repatri- ation was held up for several years due to differing opinions among the Kwaguith (5) as to where the material should go and how it should be displayed. This material now forms the basis of two Native Kwaguith museums: the U'Mistra Cultural Centre at Alert Bay and the Kwaguith Museum and Cultural Centre at Cape Mudge. Appropriately these museums, which were specifically built to house repatriated potlatch material, have themselves been used like potlatch goods in competing status claims between rival lineages. This case serves as a reminder of the complications that can arise in repatriation debates. As First Peoples feel they have the right of access to Indigenous col- lections and their interpretation within established museums, they are less likely to be hostile to the activities of the institution in question. Indigenous communities are very concerned about the preservation of their heritage which includes the conservation of their cultural artefacts. Despite the varying conditions under which museums accumulated First Peoples collections, it is recognised by many that if it was not for muse- ums many of these pieces would not exist or would be hidden away in private collections. Interpretation appears to be the main issue. The fact that it is no longer tenable for curators of ethnographic collections to be the experts about the artefacts in their care is disheartening for some museum staff. Recent developments can be seen to undermine an accumulated body of 45</page><page sequence="8">Anita Herle knowledge and expertise and to challenge the authority of scholarship. However, most curatorial staff now view the incorporation of alterna- tive viewpoints in the display and management of museum collections as a learning opportunity with significant benefits. In some instances a multi-vocal approach has been used as a practical way of incorporating differing viewpoints. The increasing number of Native-run museums and cultural centres have also set out to upgrade the professional quali- fications of their staff. The process of consultation and negotiation has greatly strengthened the relationship between museum staff and contemporary Native com- munities with mutual benefits. This is of enormous value to current research and has also provided a wealth of information about artefacts already in museum collections. Many Native elders are willing to share their experiences and memories, providing valuable information regard- ing the understanding of museum collections (6). This is particularly important now because many elders still remember how certain objects were used, or the names of individuals who made or owned specific artefacts. In this way, very specialised knowledge, often based on oral history, has been recorded for the future. For Aboriginal Canadians, participation in the interpretation and presentation of their own culture can be a crucial aspect of cultural regeneration. COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS The final section of the Task Force Report very briefly outlines recent collaborative projects between museums and First Peoples. The list, which includes 14 museums and cultural centres, is by no means com- prehensive, but it provides an overview of different types of initiatives. The final section of this paper will look in more detail at some collabo- rative projects, including a few exhibitions which were produced during or after the Task Force's Report. Many of the Task Force recommendations have already been adopted, at least in part, by numerous museums and cultural centres across Canada. Institutions such as the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (hereafter MOA) have been involved in collaborative projects for many years (7). MOA has been used as a model for other museums. Curators routinely consult 46</page><page sequence="9">Museums and First Peoples in Canada with First Peoples regarding interpretation and display and, more recently, exhibitions have been co-curated by individuals from the appropriate Indigenous community. First Peoples take an active role in public and educational program- ming and Native artists and performers are involved in the development of interpretative presentations. In the Northwest Coast cultural area, Native carvers have used objects in MOA's collection to study tradition- al designs and inspire the creation of contemporary pieces. The muse- um has played a significant role in the so-called renaissance of Northwest Coast art. The Glenbow Museum The Glenbow Museum in Calgary was also one of the first museums to develop a loans policy which acknowledged the significance of reli- gious and ceremonial objects to First Peoples. The policy, adopted by the Glenbow's Board of Governors in 1988 (8) makes provision for cer- tain sacred objects to be loaned to appropriate individuals or communi- ties for ceremonial purposes. Several loans have been made of sacred bundles (9) to members of the Blood and Peigan nations. The bundles remain in the community for an average of three to four months. Loans of this type involve a compromise on both sides: while the museum acknowledges that loan material will be handled and exposed to uncon- trolled environmental conditions, the Native people concerned realise that the object's level of spiritual care will be diminished when it is returned to the museum. Through the course of negotiating these loans, the elders have become more aware of considerations regarding physi- cal conservation and the museum workers have been made aware of the special nature of the bundles and been taught how to treat them with respect. This includes special handling and storage conditions. Requests from researchers to study or photograph sacred objects must be accompanied by a supporting letter from the appropriate Band Council, ceremonial organisation or family members. The Glenbow Museum also developed one of Canada's first Native intern programmes. After some initial difficulties and a low completion rate, the museum has adopted a more flexible approach to the training programmes, which are now geared to meet the needs of specific indi- 47</page><page sequence="10">Anita Herle viduals and communities. Through a study programme to upgrade liter- acy skills the museum has benefited from interns relating stories about individuals who owned objects in the collection. All activities related to First Peoples are overseen by the Glenbow Native Advisory Council which includes representatives from numerous tribal groups. The Advisory Council meets a few times a year to review progress and dis- cuss future plans. The Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History At the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History in Regina, a five year project to redevelop the Native Gallery is nearing completion (sched- uled to open in summer 1993). The first step in this project was to set up a consultative process which began by enlisting the assistance of a Native consultant who helped to compile a list of knowledgeable elders. Museum staff visited elders throughout the province, bringing tradition- al gifts of cloth and tobacco and ceremonies were performed praying for the success of the project. A group of elders representing the various tribes throughout the province was invited to the museum to discuss the plans for the new gallery. As a result of this meeting some of the exhibits were significantly altered. Involvement with the exhibition is providing economic benefits for some Native artists. Commissions for the gallery include a full size bison teepee, clothing and mannequins modelled from real people. Additional contemporary material was purchased from Native commu- nities. The production of a dance video, which is being developed by a Native film-maker, includes fees paid to the sponsoring Native Bands. Indigenous people are involved in writing texts for several sections of the gallery. A multi-vocal approach has been taken: at the introduction Native texts will be juxtaposed with archaeological interpretations of the peopling of North America and the sections on trapping and treaties will also include texts giving a Native perspective on these issues. Native representatives are being encouraged to develop ideas for the use of a large area which will be set aside for public programming. Staff hope that this will allow the gallery to become a forum for First Peoples to make statements about their own culture. 48</page><page sequence="11">Museums and First Peoples in Canada The Canadian Museum of Civilization The Canadian Museum of Civilization, formerly the National Museum of Canada, re-opened in 1989 at a new location in Hull, immediately across the Ottawa River from the Parliament Buildings. The two large curvilinear buildings, inspired by natural land formations, house the national history and ethnography collections. The main anthropology gallery (10) or Grand Hall has six life-sized Northwest Coast houses arranged in a single row, simulating the layout of a traditional village facing the sea (Plate 1). Stylistically, each house represents a distinct cultural group, and as one moves along the gallery one is walking along the coast from the southern Coast Salish house to the most northern Tsimshian house. The forest is represented by an enormous net backdrop which hangs behind the houses while totem poles and large feast bowls stand along the imagined shoreline in front of the houses. The houses were built by Native craftsmen and artists from the areas represented. The designs were based on a combination of ethnographic records, historical photographs and the knowledge of elders. Galleries within the houses are used for the display of smaller and more light sen- sitive artefacts, changing exhibitions, and interpretative performances. First Peoples from each of the areas represented are involved with plan- ning the displays within the interior of the houses. There is no false attempt in this gallery to present Northwest Coast culture as pristine. For example, the inside of the Kwakwaka'waka house recreates the interior of a family home as it was in 1937. The room set includes a western style sideboard, wicker chair and pram, a glass topped traditional style Northwest Coast bent cedar box contain- ing ceremonial objects, and an elaborately carved and painted house post, while framed family photographs and a picture of the Last Supper decorate the walls. New influences have continually and creatively been reworked with traditional elements. Overall, the underlying mes- sage in the gallery is that Northwest Coast culture and art is very much alive. 49</page><page sequence="12">Anita Herle Indigena 1992 was the quincentenary of Columbus and events to acknowledge this event were very highly politically charged, particularly in North America. The 1992 exhibition at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, Indigena, was a cooperative venture by the CMC, the Indian Art Centre of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, and the Society of Canadian Artists of Native Ancestry. It was co-ordinated by two Native curators, Gerald McMaster and Lee- Ann Martin. The exhibition included eight writers and nineteen visual artists from across Canada who responded with great passion to the experiences of the last five hundred years. In the introduction to the catalogue the cura- tors clearly outline the significance of 1992 for Indigenous peoples: While the rest of the world revels in its accomplishments, indigenous peoples will reflect on this "meeting of cultures", addressing such issues as historicity, cultural conquest, Aboriginal title, identity and sovereign- ty. Perhaps there will be something to celebrate - aside from a nautical error - if 1992 can be a date when consciousness about indigenous his- tories and continued existence begins to be presented to a substantial audience throughout the world (McMaster and Martin 1992a: 12) In the exhibition individual Indigenous artists address such issues as colonisation, cultural conflict, the attempted destruction of traditional practices and values, separation from land and the break-up of families. Lawrence Paul's mixed media piece situates the exhibition in the con- text of contemporary political issues as First Peoples struggle for self- determination (Plate 2). Entitled The Transformation of Bill Wilson (11), the artwork draws on the imagery of traditional Northwest Coast transformation masks. A highly stylised and brightly coloured anthro- pomorphic face opens to reveal a central message written in bold letter- ing, "SELF GOVERNMENT NOW". In the central panel of Carl Beam's triptych series Burying the Ruler, a large photograph of the artist holding a ruler is reproduced on a grainy and streaked surface with the title of the series written in red along the bottom. The piece is a visual pun on the word ruler: according to the curators, "the ruler he holds symbolises the standards by which aborigi- nal cultures are measured and found to be lacking from a Euro- 50</page><page sequence="13">Museums and First Peoples in Canada ó i &lt; © 6 O I i u I x 1 O &amp;&gt; .s cd I I CU 51</page><page sequence="14">Anita Herle Plate 2 The Transformation of Bill Wilson by Lawrence Paul.

Herle. 52</page><page sequence="15">Museums and First Peoples in Canada Canadian perspective "(McMaster and Martin 1992b:3). The imposition of European standards is developed in Eric Robertson's wall installation Bearings and Demeanours. At the bottom of the installation is a row of surveyors' measures topped by collars. The measures symbolise the imposition of European standards which divided the land and created precise boundaries, separating Indigenous people from their land and history, and the collars suggest restraint. In contrast, the upper half of the installation shows the interrelationship between religion, history, land and wealth in traditional Northwest Coast society. Three copper potlatch hats are mounted in a triangular formation above three bird's beaks, each holding a small sphere, allud- ing to the myth of the Raven stealing the sun back from the Chief of the Skies. The material of construction is reminiscent of the copper plaques which were the most valuable objects exchanged at potlatches. The removal of people from traditional lands and on to reservations is powerfully depicted in Joanne Cardinal-Schubert's installation Preservation of a Species: DECONSTRUCTIVISTS (This is the house that Joe built). A group of stick figures wearing head scarves is enclosed by a black picket fence. The edges of the installation are sur- rounded by black walls which are used like blackboards to discuss aspects of racism and the artist's family history. Cardinal-Schubert, her- self an non-status Indian, is highly critical of the Indian Act which has been used to define Native people and control their lives. Peep holes in the walls, like those at a construction site, emphasise the sense of sepa- ration from the dominant society. National Pastimes, seven oil paintings by Jim Logan, depict a group of Native children playing ice hockey in small town Canada. According to the artist "in these paintings you will find evidence of the tragic reali- ties of life that are temporarily forgotten by those involved with the game that has been entitled our National Pastime" (ibid:9). The six smaller paintings reveal scenes of alcoholism, suicide and violence and hint at the recently revealed atrocities of sexual and physical abuse in church-run residential schools. Several Native artists exartiine historical incidents involving violent confrontations. Rick Rivet's acrylic paintings Wounded Knee and Custer question the "official" version of history. Joe David's installa- tion, Old World Order, New World Order, juxtaposes the massacre of 53</page><page sequence="16">Anita Eerie the Iroquois by Champlain with the armed confrontation between Mohawk warriors and the Canadian army at Kaneshsatake (Oka) in the summer of 1990. The stand-off at Oka, which lasted over two months, attracted international attention and brought out into the open bitter dis- putes regarding Native land rights and self-determination, issues which are still to be resolved. Newspaper clippings discussing the confrontation at Oka float with ghost-like images of First Peoples in Jane Ash Pointras' painting Shaman Never Die. Juxtaposed in the top right corner is an historic photo of Chief Poundmaker, a leader in the Resistance Movement (Riel Rebellion) in the 1870s and 1880s and also a spiritual leader. Poitras relates the tragedy of Aboriginal people to a loss of traditional spiritual- ity. "Only through spiritual renewal can we find out who we really are, be empowered to achieve our potential and acquire the wisdom to elim- inate the influences that bring tragedy upon us and destroy us" (Poitras in McMaster and Martin 1992a: 167). Underlying the brutal depictions of the consequences of colonisation is the hope of reconciliation. 1992 is also a point of departure for the future and for the rediscovery of indigenous identity. In the third panel of Burying the Ruler, Carl Beam suggests the possible co-existence of two value systems and proposes that "contemporary aboriginal cultures can regain strength through belief in traditional values and spirituality" (McMaster and Martin 1992b:3). Despite the exposure of atrocities in National Pastimes the artist places a young fiddler in each painting symbolising "the possible future that is possible in an atmosphere of mutual respect and interchange between Canadians of aboriginal and European ancestries" (ibid:9). In addition to the stated purpose of the exhibition, to provide a forum for contemporary Native artists to address the issues surrounding the 1992 quincentenary, Indigena also challenges Western museological distinctions between art and artefact, traditional and modern, Aboriginal and Western forms of expression. These classifications are not relevant to contemporary First Peoples. Woodland Cultural Centre Over the last decade First Peoples have been setting up their own muse- 54</page><page sequence="17">Museums and First Peoples in Canada urns and cultural centres. One example is the Woodland Cultural Centre located on Six Nations Indian Reservation in Brantford, Ontario, about 50 miles from Toronto, Canada's largest city. Woodland's director, Tom Hill, was the co-chair for the Task Force on Museums and First Peoples (see above). Until the 1970s many young Native Canadians were forcibly sent to residential schools as part of a policy of assimilation. The residential school in Brantford was closed in 1969 and taken over by the Six Nations Council. In 1983 it opened as the Woodland Cultural Centre. Currently it has a full-time staff of approximately 25, including curato- rial staff, educators and administrators. In conjunction with the muse- um, the Centre boasts an ambitious and successful education section. In addition to providing educational programmes for local Native schools on traditional and contemporary Indigenous cultures, last year they catered to almost 20,000 students from multi-ethnic schools in Toronto. Next to the Cultural Centre a new purpose-built building was con- structed for the museum. The museum's permanent collection contains approximately 2,500 ethnographic pieces in addition to archaeological material. It includes recently purchased contemporary material, as well as historic and contemporary material primarily donated from Six Nations people. A false face mask, included in a tribal art auction, was purchased with the assistance of a Canadian cultural property grant. The permanent displays include a large section on wampum, which was used to record important political and religious ceremonies. The staff are particularly pleased in having successfully negotiated for repa- triation of much of the wampum in the collection. In May 1988 eleven Grand River wampum belts were returned from the Heye Foundation and further pieces followed from the New York State University and the Royal Ontario Museum. Some of the wampum belts record treaties between the British and Six Nations, many of which were subsequently broken by British and Canadian politicians. The repatriated belts were a central feature of a special exhibition mounted in 1989, Council Fire, which focused on the adaptation of complex traditional forms of gov- ernment among the Iroquois and Algonkian. The Woodland Cultural Centre has subsequently placed several pieces of wampum in the care of confederacy chiefs, considered to be the rightful owners. The permanent exhibition area of the museum uses professional and 55</page><page sequence="18">Anita Herle relatively traditional museum display methods, including the incorpora- tion of room-sets and dioramas. The first sections of the permanent exhibition are organised chronologically and movement is subtly con- trolled by the layout of the galleries, beginning with the recreation of a traditional Iroquois long house and an attempt to recreate daily life prior to contact. Sections on first contact and the fur trade are followed by galleries which look at the strains of adaptation and acculturation. While the museum's purpose is to give an historical account from the Native point of view, overall the text is remarkably generous to Europeans. With the arrival of the Europeans the prehistory of this area effectively ends and the historic [period] begins. The beliefs customs and traditions of the First Nations and Europeans differed dramatically. In spite of these differences, the First Nations taught the Europeans many skills such as herbal medicine and survival in a new land. In return the Europeans offered tools, weapons, cloth and beads. Agricultural pur- suits were to change encouraged by the newcomers' zeal to Européanise the Native people's beliefs and customs (exhibition text panel "The Fur Trade" Woodlands Cultural Centre 1992). Religion and ceremonial life are discussed in a section called "the Spirit of the Forest" which focuses on the Iroquoian falseface society. This section includes a large graphic illustration of someone wearing a falseface mask (Plate 3) and a model of a falseface being carved. "Blessed" falseface masks are not shown and along with other sacred material are kept in separate areas of store with restricted access or may be made available to the appropriate community for religious or cere- monial reasons. According to the guidelines in Woodland's Museum Policies, "Only images of masks which have not been 'blessed' or have not been used in any ceremonial function will be presented in any Centre sponsored display" (Woodland Museum:23). Towards the end .of the exhibition the visitor passes through the "First Nations Hall of Fame", a narrow gallery which celebrates the accom- plishments of individual First Peoples. These figures serve as important role models to the many Native children who are escorted through the museum by education officers. The end of the exhibition looks at the contemporary life of Six Nations People.

Noted for their skill at ironworking and their command of heights, many Iroquois men working away from the reservations have made their professional reputations through the construction of bridges and skyscrapers. While the distinctive character- istics of different First Nations groups of the Eastern Woodland area are highlighted in separate display cases, the final display looks at the devel- opment of a pan-Indian identity in North America. The development of regional and national cultural and political organisations and improved communications have contributed to a broader Indian identity. Pow wows, not merely a forum for competitive dancing, are important socio- political functions where people from different areas meet to exchange information and goods. Clothing styles no longer reflect a distinct tribal identity, as is clear by the costumes on display "... to dress like an Indian today is to wear a Sioux bonnet, Navaho turquoise jewellery, beaded belts and western styled jackets, trousers and skirts" (text panel Woodland Cultural Centre 1992). While most of the of the museum area is used for the permanent dis- plays, there is also a large temporary gallery with a very active pro- gramme of well researched changing exhibitions which utilises innova- tive curatorial techniques. Fluffs and Feathers Fluffs and Feathers, an exhibit on the symbols of "Indianness", origi- nally opened at the Woodland Cultural Centre in 1988. Cooperative negotiations between the ethnography department of the Royal Ontario Museum (hereafter ROM) and the Woodland Cultural Centre prepared Fluffs and Feathers as a travelling exhibition. The exhibition opened at ROM in late 1992. In the exhibition, countless images depicting all too familiar stereotypes confront the viewer. In a "cabinet of curiosities", Native objects are displayed alongside natural history specimens, rocks and fossils. The interrogative text asks, "What do you think this means about the way they thought of Indians?" (text panel Fluffs and Feathers 1992). From nineteenth century World Expositions to Wild West shows, romance novels and Hollywood films, stereotypes of Indians as "weird, wonderful and wild" have been presented to captive audiences. 59</page><page sequence="22">Anita Herle Brightly coloured advertising posters show Indian war dances and numerous scenes of Buffalo Bill to the rescue, one with the caption "The Death of Chief Tall Bull: An Actual Historic Event at the Battle of Summit Springs in which Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill) as chief of scouts succeeds in ending the earthly career of the hostile redskin." Photographs of Hollywood stars who acted as "redskins" challenge the viewer to identify the "real Indians". Needless to say, there are very few Indigenous people beside the mainstream stars, including Rock Hudson thinly disguised as Taza, Son of Cochise (Universal Pictures 1954). A case containing romance novels reveals the stereotype of the romantic but dangerous savage. The words pop out from the dust jack- ets. "Bronze warrior. White captive. He forced her to learn the pleasures of Savage Heat." Captions from inside the book are suspended above the texts, "those eyes, those cold, mean killer black eyes were unmis- takably those of a fierce, untamed savage" {Savage Heat). The visitor is invited to explore the fantasy of being "Indian", by dressing in fancy dress, complete with feather headdress, or posing next to "Indian" cut-outs (Plate 4). The cut-outs are set against a "typical" Indian village backdrop which combines teepees originating from the Plains area with totem poles from the Northwest Coast. Non-Indigenous Canadians have played at being Indians for over a century, at regular events such as Banff Indian Days or the Calgary Stampede. Here the exhibition skilfully probes the nature of ethnic and cultural identity and stresses the importance of looking beyond cultural stereotypes. This section also explores the relationship between Indians and tourism in Canada. Indians have often been used as a cultural resource by out- siders. Native symbols have been appropriated by various levels of Canadian government, institutions and corporations, New Age organi- sations and numerous commercial products. A large section entitled "How much is that Indian in the Window?" is full of artefacts which barrage the visitor with familiar stereotypes that have been promoted in advertising: vicious heathen, romantic savage, or symbol of Canada. A Lucky Strike cigarette advertisement showing physical combat between two warriors has the caption "Nature in the raw is seldom mild and raw tobaccos have no place in cigarettes". The romance of Hiawatha and Minnehaha is depicted on a biscuit tin. The gallery abounds with Canadian souvenirs based on Indian themes: 60</page><page sequence="23">Museums and First Peoples in Canada miniature teepees, birchbark canoes, dolls with fringed leather clothing and plastic totem poles. The caption of a Canadian government adver- tisement reads, "Paleface my skin is dark but my heart is white for I also give to Canadian Patriotic Fund". Whether showing positive or negative stereotypes, this type of advertising has the effect of objectify- ing Indigenous Canadians. The conclusion goes beyond notions of Indianness and invites the vis- itor to think about stereotyping in general. The stereotyping of one group of people by another is an act of power and control. The text panel ends: You cannot exert control over another person, another group of people unless you think of them as inferior and yourself as superior. At the beginning of this exhibition the introductory panel asked you to think about your image of Indians, what it is really asking is "how do you see yourself1? (Text panel Fluffs and Feathers 1992) This powerful exhibition exposes historical myths about Indigenous Canadians in a manner which is both amusing and shocking. Most of us are familiar with these types of images, and there is a danger that the exhibition may actually promote the stereotypes it attempts to expose (12). However, the clear storyline and careful contextualisation in Fluffs and Feathers highlights the serious, degrading and objectifying implications of stereotypes and addresses racism and ongoing injus- tices. Given the current political climate, it is unlikely that such an exhi- bition could have been produced by non-Indigenous curators without attracting considerable protest. Conclusion The dialogue which is occurring today between First Peoples and muse- ums in Canada is being conducted on a case by case basis within the guidelines set out by the Task Force. This is quite different from what is happening in the United States where recent Federal legislation has imposed blanket legislation regarding access and repatriation. While many of the Task Force recommendations have already been developed by numerous museums and cultural centres across Canada, some represent a completely different attitude to that previously held by 61</page><page sequence="24">Anita Herle museum professionals. Curatorial authority is no longer unchallenge- able. While the general mood among the museum community appears to be one of cooperation and optimism, there is no doubt that difficult decisions will have to be made which will inevitably involve compro- mises and alter professional standards. An open attitude of cooperation is absolutely essential to the process that is going on. If decisions are being made on moral and ethical grounds as opposed to legal ones, there is an enormous grey area in which issues are to be resolved by negotiation. How does one define "cultural patrimony"? What happens when different value systems collide? The grey areas not only include the relationship between museums and First Peoples, but differing options and values held by members of Canada's 50 distinct Indigenous groups. A fuller understanding of the relationship between museums and First Peoples in Canada must take into account the broader issues regarding Indigenous rights and self-government, a debate which has become centre stage in Canadian politics. It is generally predicted that some form of Native self-government will be in place by the year 2000. In Canada and elsewhere, global processes of decolonisation and démocratisation have brought issues regarding the politics of culture to the forefront. It would be wrong to suppose that the implications of the Canadian Task Force Report and collaborative initiatives are limited to encounters between museums and their immediate Indigenous popula- tions. Issues regarding interpretation, access and repatriation are urgent for all museums with ethnographic collections and post-imperial Britain is no exception. Members of Indigenous communities worldwide are taking a closer and often critical look at the way they are represented by international museums. It is crucial for British museums to develop sen- sitive policies to deal with the cultural and political issues that will inevitably arise, including requests for repatriation. These trends will not result in the demise of museum collections or diminish the importance of museum ethnography. Rather, as Canadian examples have shown, collaborative projects involving collection, inter- pretation and representation will strengthen the museum as an impor- tant site for anthropological research. The preservation and curation of cultural objects is central to the concerns of Indigenous peoples and anthropologists should take this seriously. Museum ethnography, long seen as peripheral to the discipline of anthropology, will become more 62</page><page sequence="25">Museums and First Peoples in Canada salient as vital issues involving cross-cultural encounters are raised within our institutions. The increasing involvement of Indigenous peo- ples with museums is a significant opportunity for the future.

Notes 1. This paper was presented at the Museum Ethnographers' Group Conference "Museum Ethnography annd Communities" at Liverpool Museum on 1 April 1993. 2. Currently, the terms First Peoples, First Nations, Aboriginal, Indigenous, or Native Canadians may be used interchangeably to refer to Canada's original inhabitants. 3. In fact, First Peoples do not form a homogeneous group but repre- sent the members of over 50 distinct Indigenous groups within Canada. 4. The Canadian government imposed a potlatch ban which lasted from 1884 to 1951. Those involved with the "illegal" potlatch were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Subsequently an arrangement was offered whereby the people arrested would avoid imprisonment if they and their families surrendered their ceremonial regalia. Many refused and were sent to jail but families from Alert Bay, Cape Mudge and Village Island forfeited their precious objects. As a result, over 450 objects were appropriated by the then National Museum of Canada and other major museums. 5. The Kwaguith now generally prefer the name Kwakwaka'waka 63</page><page sequence="26">Anita Herle which means speakers of the Kwak'wala language. 6. In 1985 the Glenbow Museum initiated an innovative project in which Native elders were hired as professional consultants to review and assess artefacts and photographs in the museum's collections, cf. Elizabeth Churchill "The Blackfoot Elders Project: Linking Peoples and Objects in Museum Research" in Native Studies Review, Vol. 3. No.2, 1987. 7. cf. Michael Ames "Cultural empowerment and museums; opening up anthropology through collaboration" in Susan Pearce (ed) 1990, Objects of Knowledge« Athlone Press. 8. It is no doubt relevant that this is the same year that The Spirit Sings opened at the Glenbow Museum. 9. Sacred bundles, sometimes called "medicine bundles", are required for some religious ceremonies. The bundles contain items with spiritual power. Knowledge regarding the contents of bundles and the signifi- cance of the items contained is usually "secret" or restricted. 10. Galleries which will represent other Indigenous cultural groups across Canada have yet to reach completion. 11. Bill Wilson is a contemporary Native politician from British Columbia who is a strong proponent of Native self-government. 12. In 1990 an exhibition at the same museum, Into the Heart of Africa, provoked violent protest. While the intent of the exhibition was to expose the prejudice and exploitation involved in the imperialist vision of Africa, the project back-fired. Critics claimed the exhibition promoted racism and protesters demonstrated outside the Royal Ontario Museum for approximately six months during which period violence erupted between the police and demonstrators on several occasions and people were arrested. The curator of the exhibition, Jeanne Cannizo, was treated as a scapegoat and her professional career and personal well-being were threatened by the protesters. 64</page><page sequence="27">Museums and First Peoples in Canada References Ames, Michael. 1992.
