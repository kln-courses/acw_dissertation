<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPIRITUAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS By ROGER SHARROCK THREE centuries of readers of The Pilgrim's Progress have ignored Bunyan's Calvinism, and for a very good reason. Earlier Noncon- formist and Evangelical readers no doubt took his theology for granted, but once the storms of seventeenth-century controversy and persecution had cleared away there was no polemic near enough to the surface to suggest a sectarian bias in the book. Ignorance, the unwary youth who trusts in the goodness of his own heart and is severely snubbed by Christian and Hope- ful, may be a hit at Quaker reliance on the 'inner light', but to notice this is to delve in past controversy which does not increase one jot our appreciation of the vividness of the picture: the shocked complacency of the youth when brought up against the uncompromising twice-born religion of the genuine pilgrims. From the first, the keynotes in the appreciation of Bunyan were his stylistic virtues and his universal appeal.' So that when his work began to engage the attention of professional critics from Macaulay onwards, it was the miracle of the sublime tinker, the literary common denominator of Christendom, which they acclaimed, not the Calvinist or the Puritan. Yet the same Bunyan had published a characteristically Puritan doctrinal work, The Doctrine of the Law and Grace Unfolded, and even had attributed to him a treatise on Reprobation Asserted. Yet another good reason for the neglect of the theological side is that for most people Calvinism means predestination. One would expect the acceptance of such a principle as that of divine election and reprobation to have an unfortunate effect on religious allegory: one might envisage a spiritual exclusiveness in the pilgrims that would make them intolerable characters in any work of the imagination: at the same time one might expect this dogma to drain away all dramatic interest from the Christian life in the world, leaving the Field of Folk as the scene of an uneventful march to the scaffold or the throne.

Yet Bunyan's story is not only interesting, but in places excitingly adventurous, with the breathless adventure of romance which makes the reader curious about what happens next. Dogmatic discussion is kept well on the fringes of the main episodes of adventure and can conveniently be ignored by the modern reader. So Calvinism goes by the board, because the book is not dull, and not narrowly propagandist. But these are not considered adequate reasons for abstaining from an examination of the Catholicism of Dante's Divina Commedia, a far greater work of art, or the theological structure of Piers Plowman, about which several theories have lately been advanced. In directing attention in this article to the Calvinist basis of Bunyan's ideas about salvation, I do not wish to delve in minutiae bearing no relation to The Pilgrim's Progress as a part of literature; I intend to show how Bunyan's beliefs and the spiritual experiences recorded in his autobiography help to decide the form taken by the allegory, the order of the episodes, and the dovetailing of one into the other. I There is a central principle in Calvinist theology which resolves the tension between the total depravity of fallen man and the transcendent goodness of God; the soul can achieve salvation through no merely human righteousness, only through the imputed righteousness of Christ displayed in his incarnate life and sacrifice, and 'imputed' or given to man because of no individual merits but by free grace in election.' Like other attempts at systematic theology, this is a restatement of one main article of traditional Christian belief around which the rest are built up. Calvin professes to find all the Fathers except Augustine unconvincing on the perplexing question of the limits of human free-will; he holds that man's will was indeed free before his fatal choice, but that after the Fall it has shared in the corruption of all his other gifts; the continued use of the term 'free- will' is simply unfortunate because of its capacity to mislead.2 He differs radically from Augustine in tracing the origin of grace to election-the marking out for salvation of a soul by God before the beginning of time- not baptism, and in attributing the endurance of the soul in its course to the sanctifying power of grace, not to individual perseverance. It is this doctrine of election and reprobation which has usually drawn the critics of Calvinism, but what concerns us here is not the unpitying logic on which they usually dwell, but the striking dramatic potentialities. Bunyan's own doctrinal writings show clearly that he was impregnated with all the Calvin, Institution, ed. Pannier (Paris, 1936), ii. 251-92; iii. 64-5. 2 Ibid. i. 107-8.</page><page sequence="3">104 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) situations of this theology and had full command of the enthusiastic preacher's manner of reconstructing them dramatically. When the pilgrim path becomes wholly an illustration of the work of grace in election, there is no possibility of a treatment of the full life of man like that in Catholic allegory, or even in Spenser. No Braggadochio flaunts his way through Bunyan's pages and most of the humorous passages are about backsliders or heretics. The terrors and splendours of conversion to the twice-born soul take the place of the rich bustle of the life of the church; simply to know when grace is really present becomes of prime importance, ranking above heroic deeds performed for the faith. So the progress of Bunyan's pilgrim begins only when this tremendously significant action of grace has been initiated: Christian listens to the words of Evangelist. When only a quarter of the story is told, Christian receives the imputed righteousness of Christ and is relieved of the burden of his sins. This episode is related so briefly and baldly that its importance might well be overlooked: He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below in the bottom, a Sepulchre. So I saw in my Dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble; and so continued to do, till it came to the mouth of the Sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and said with a merry heart, He hath given me Rest by his Sorrow; and Life, by his Death.' Then three shining ones give him a change of raiment, set a mark on his forehead, and entrust him with 'a Roll with a Seal upon it' (the token of his election). Christian has had an assurance of grace that tells him, as a voice seemed to tell Bunyan himself at a famous crisis of Grace Abounding, that his righteousness is in heaven:2 he now knows his inward leanings to the Scriptures and to good works are not the hollow self-deceptions of the reprobate. Appropriately, this assurance comes immediately after his visit to the Interpreter's House. The symbolic revelations of that epi- sode represent the fruits of Bible study, and a bestowal of grace would be expected to follow an intense concentration on the Scriptures. The episode casts a special light on the remaining three-quarters of Part One. Christian, Faithful, and Hopeful are fixed and set in the path of salvation; it is the horrors of temptation they have to undergo, not the possibility that they may waver, which engage our attention. What happens at Vanity Fair is not a treatment of the temptations of the world and the flesh in their effect on men in the manner of Spenser's Bower of ' The Pilgrim's Progress, ed. Brown, p. I68. 2 Grace Abounding, ?? 229-32.</page><page sequence="4">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 105 Bliss, but an account of the persecution to be endured by the saints of God with its basis in the text 'When men shall revile you and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake'. Because the central characters are chosen, the static passages of conversation about their fellow travellers have a tone of calm superiority which might be considered damaging to the book's humanity as a work of art; and even in the accounts of temptations the view of human experience given is narrowly limited by the power of resistance the pilgrims have received in election. Thus the Hill Lucre episode does not treat avarice with anything like the fullness of Spenser's picture of the Cave of Mammon: Guyon is led aside from the way into the cave (this, of course, is necessary for the pictorial method of the allegory in The Faerie Queene); he falls to rise again. A few words shouted from the roadside in answer to his invitation to enter the silver mine are all that Christian needs to settle with Demas: there is no question of a choice of two ways of life presented and a decision to be made. Christian begins by saying, when the less experienced Hopeful suggests they should view the place: Not I ... I have heard of this place before now, and how many have there been slain; and besides, that Treasure is a snare to those that seek it, for it hindreth them in their Pilgrimage. Then Christian called to Demas, saying, Is not the place dangerous? hath it not hindred many in their Pilgrimage ? The elect are above this particular temptation, and the Hill Lucre stands fittingly aside from the way; it is left to By-ends and his companions to go over to Demas 'at the first beck' and perish in the pit. In the Doubting Castle episode it may seem that theology has given place to pure chap-book adventure, the raw-head-and-bloody-bones of some black-letter Seven Champions of Christendom found on the stalls of Stourbridge Fair. Chris- tian and Hopeful have indeed fallen this time: Christian leads them astray along By-path Meadow and they are soon fast in the dungeon of Giant Despair. It looks at first as if the traditional type of Christian adventure story has justified itself. This, then, is the gilding of the pill by which Bunyan so excelled his fellow Baptist Benjamin Keach's fictional wares that he beat them out of the market. Chance and danger have reasserted themselves in a world freed from the compulsion of Calvinist determinism. But if so it is the strangest of adventure stories, for during all their perils Christian carries with him the means of their deliverance: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate Speech, What afool, quoth he, am I thus to lie in a stinking Dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty! I have a Key in my bosom, called Promise, that I The Pilgrim's Progress, ed. Brown, p. 229.</page><page sequence="5">106 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) will, I am perswaded, open any lock in Doubting Castle. Then said Hopeful, That's good news; good Brother pluck it out of thy bosom and try.' God's covenant with his elect has not been forgotten; Christian can only neglect it for a time, till his own regenerate heart recalls him to the promise of faith. No allegorical intermediary brings Christian the key; it is with him all the time, emphasizing at the expense of narrative interest a prin- ciple of Puritan psychology. Escape is now certain, though the story- teller Bunyan makes the iron outer gate of the castle difficult to overcome: 'but that lock went damnable hard'. Professor Firth saw in this Bunyan's colloquial warmth getting the better of the proprieties.2 There is also a grim theological pun involving the whole conception of the soul's struggle against the despair which means damnation. How could a progress the end of which was fore-ordained keep the interest of a novel? For The Pilgrim's Progress considered as a secular work of art gives an impression of unified power beyond the attractions of romance. Nor do the vigour and purity of the English comprise the whole of its appeal. As well as romantic variety of incident, giants and hob- goblins, and racy common speech, there is something which breeds a continuous interest in what the main characters are doing. We do not come away with the feeling that we have witnessed a merely inevitable progress of the chosen believers to the Kingdom of Heaven, although the Calvinist framework might seem to entail that. This is because the drama- tic excitement of the struggle with evil is transferred to the inner life of Christian; the spectres of doubt and spiritual terror which still raise them- selves in the confirmed professor provide the interest, because they are seen from his side. We look through his eyes and share his own uncer- tainty about the outcome, though actually on the longer view of the divine purpose there is no uncertainty. One of the most dramatic features of Calvinism is the implication of the inscrutability of Providence;3 when it is considered in relation to predestination the faithful professor, who is without some positive assurance of the Spirit, may feel like the apostate Francis Spira or Bunyan's Bedford contemporary, John Child,4 that he has doom hanging over him. Bunyan spent more time in dire spiritual struggles after his conversion than he did before it, and the greater part of ' The Pilgrim's Progress, ed. Brown, p. 239. 2 C. H.

Of this life of Spira there is an earlier edition with the date 1649, published by Christopher Meredith, and now in the Bunyan Library at Bedford.

After an extremely scrappy account of his early unregenerate life, the narrative of his 'calling' continues with incident after incident down to particulars of the texts which haunted him for days like living presences, and then a few pages about his ministry are added to complete the book. This is the form taken by many a Puritan spiritual autobiography: conver- sion, calling, and ministry are recounted, with a wealth of detail expended on the second division. Once again the psychological method of the preachers explains why this should be. The two great sins of Puritanism, as Professor Haller has remarked,' were excess of confidence leading to hypocrisy, and, at the other extremity, diffidence leading to despair in vocation. The latter was often the more grievous, and the abundant literature of Puritan soul-healing came into existence to provide diagnosis and treatment. Such a treatise as Goodwin's A Childe of Light Walking in Darkness (1636), with its 'whole discourse about Satan's part', was written for this purpose; the very title of Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners is aimed as a restorative at the victim of such a despondency. Thus the temptations dealt with by Bunyan in his allegory represent the typical sins of a believer; at the same time they provide the tension neces- sary to make Calvinism interesting. There is no treatment of the weakness of the flesh (Faithful's recapitulation of his encounter with Wanton is the briefest mention of this). The Slough of Despond, Doubting Castle, and the terrible figure of the man in the Interpreter's House who is utterly without hope: 'I am become a Man of Despair'-these figures of spiritual malaise beset Christian in his dark night of the soul; over-confidence appears in his losing his scroll, and on the occasion when Hopeful and he are chastized by an angel. Since Bunyan had already dealt directly with these experiences in his own person in Grace Abounding, that book clearly provides a key to much of the psychology of conversion and calling which is figured allegorically in the First Part of The Pilgrim's Progress. It is worth noting here that all these remarks apply most particularly to that part, where the subject is the experience of the individual soul. When Faithful and Hopeful are intro- duced, though they lighten the way for Christian, they come as individuals with their own lonely soul-searchings behind them. The fight with Apol- lyon is the typical episode: a lonely and dramatic struggle. In Part Two the tone is utterly different and behind it there is a difference of method. Christiana and her family move through a gayer and less stressful world than that of the First Part; many of the former perils are commemorated only by tablets. This represents the settled life of a Nonconformist com- munity, a church of believers like Bedford meeting. Problems of courtship 'Haller, The Rise of Puritanism (New York, 1938), PP. 15z ff.</page><page sequence="7">108 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) and marriage are introduced. It is the woman's world of social detail and everyday behaviour, A Swiss Family Robinson after Robinson Crusoe.' Christian is always, till he crosses the river, balanced on a crisis which lifts him right out of the sphere of ethics. The echo of his original cry, 'What shall I do to be saved', can be heard throughout. In the sequel, doctrine is present, but incidentally rather than structurally (as in the delightfully simple embroidery of the apples which turn Matthew's stomach and the pills which cure him). It is in the first part that the personal drama of Calvinism is found at its purest. II When the stages in the author's calling described in Grace Abounding are compared with the episodes of the First Part, it is remarkable how in the grasp of his vividly concrete imagination quotations from Scripture are already, even within the limits of autobiography, becoming personified. Ideas about justification speedily take on sensuous life; the metaphors are not merely illustrative imagery but express the essence of his experience. In this Bunyan conforms to a particular type of mystical mentality. But he does not aspire like the great mystics to a spiritual union with the divine love. His concern is only with salvation. He enjoys the immediate illumi- nation of the mystic; for instance, in this celebrated passage where the relief that came to him found words very like those of Luther he had read: But one day, as I was passing in the field, and that too with some dashes on my Conscience, fearing lest all was not right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul, Thy righteousness is in Heaven; and methought withal, I saw, with the Eyes of my Soul, Jesus Christ at God's Right Hand. . . . Now did my Chains fall off my Legs indeed; I was loosed from my Affliction and Irons; my Temptations also fled away; so that, from that time, those dreadful Scriptures of God left off to trouble me; now went I also home rejoicing, for the Grace and Love of God.2 ' Ronald A. Knox, Essays in Satire (London, 1928), p. 2o6: 'Christian goes on a pil- grimage, Christiana goes on a walking-tour.' 2 Grace Abounding, ?? 230-I. Bunyan is giving in dramatic terms the substance of the following passage in Luther from the section entitled 'What difference there is between Faith and Hope': 'There is nothing more deare or precious in all the world to the true children of God, than this doctrine. For they that understand this doctrine doe know that whereof all the world is ignorant: namely, that sinne, death and all other miseries, afflic- tions, and calamities, as well corporall as spirituall, doe turn to the benefite and profit of the elect. Moreover, they know that God is then most nere unto them when he seemeth to be farthest off, and that he is then a most mercifull and loving Saviour, when he semeth to be most angry, to afflict, and destroy. Also they know that they have an everlasting righteous- ness, which they wait for through hope, as a certain and sure possession laid up for them in heaven, even when they feele the horrible terrours of sinne and death .. .' (Commentary on</page><page sequence="8">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 109 But the objective character of this interior experience is not complicated by any elaborate metaphysical interweavings as in the case of mystics with an intellectual background and education. All Bunyan's visitations take the form of texts of Scripture remembered or seen in a new light:' they are distinguished by the exclusively sensuous nature of the vigorous imagery in which he describes them from the reports of other mystics who usually combine concrete figures with emotional and intellectual. 'What sentence fell upon me, that piece of a sentence dated in upon me'; when he introduces his experiences like this we feel that the word of the Bible has become to him a physical presence; Puritan Bibliolatry has found its poet. In his moments of illumination God makes the Scriptures 'shine before me . . . dwell with me, talk with me, and comfort me'. Tactile images predominate over the figures drawn from the other senses,2 and it is this which gives a particular harsh concreteness to Bunyan's spiritual confes- sions, reproducing in the vocabulary an almost physical sense of the strain between the tempter and the tempted: This sentence lay like a mill-post upon my back. (? 90go.) That scripture did also tear and rend my soul. (g 105.) These places did pinch me very sore. (? I79.) These thoughts would so confound me, and imprison me, and tie me up from faith. (? 186.) The texts which threaten become personified as actual devils and tormen- tors; they are ready to take their place as evil spirits in the Valley of the Shadow of Death where we shall eventually trace them. There was the time when, for about a week or a fortnight, he was much followed by the scripture 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you' (Luke xxii. 31). The auditory illusion was so strong that he would look over his shoulder to see if some man had actually called: I thought verily, as I have told you, that somebody had called after me, that was half a mile behind me; and although that was not my name, yet it made me suddenly look behind me, believing that he who called so loud meant me.3 Galatians, ed. 1575, f. 233). Bunyan's account of Christian and his burden may also have owed something to Luther when he discusses Galatians vi. 5 (f. 271), 'For every man shall beare his owne burden'. ' Or, in psychological jargon, he was 'a victim of verbal automatisms, both motor and sensory' (William James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 1903, p. 157, in a discussion of the melancholy preceding twice-born conversion which includes an estimate of Bunyan's case). 2 The following proportions are given by E. Mercault, Le Cas 'Bunyan' et le tempera- ment psychologique (Clermont-Ferrand, 191o): Tactile imagery . . ? 40 Visual . . . . .

It is really misleading to analyse in formal literary or psychological terms these powerful expressions of Grace Abounding in an attempt to pigeon-hole them as 'imagery'. Bunyan was trying to reproduce as exactly as possible what actually happened to him, not selecting metaphors, but describing the sensory experiences which did take place. He possessed a type of mind which instantly transferred every conception into concrete terms; this is more important as an explanation of the manner of these confessions than any influence from the physical imagery of the Old Testament, for imita- tion of Hebrew style is less conspicuous in his prose than might be supposed. The method is anthropomorphic; the texts he had taken one by one accord- ing to the habits of the sectaries and pored on for days at a time became living persons, malicious or consolatory. Naturally attracted to the estab- lished literary modes of Puritanism, he took kindly to the type of figurative sermon which was already half-way to being an extended simile. The Strait Gate, written just before Part One of The Pilgrim's Progress, makes use of so many similitudes that it makes the form seem to have reached saturation-point; beyond this stage the writer can only dissolve his sermon in a string of figurative sentences or go on to make allegory and parable the basis of his work. For Bunyan's temperament it was easy to do this and consign the Bible references to his margins; he also blended with his allegory the matter of the other Puritan form, the enthusiastic autobio- graphy, giving to Christian's story the dramatic urgency of his own conversion. This too was made easy since the spiritual experiences of Grace Abounding were already so objectively treated. III Christian's progress from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City corresponds with remarkable closeness to the history of the author's conversion, though some of the episodes in The Pilgrim's Progress which " In the Second Part, though the pilgrims have daylight to help them through the Valley, there are certain terrors remaining and among them 'a hollow Voice of Roaring'. 2 The Pilgrim's Progress, ed. Brown, p. 191.</page><page sequence="10">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 111 can be recognized as echoes of this personal experience have been shifted out of sequence. The City of Destruction corresponds, of course, to the account of Bunyan's upbringing and early impieties in the first sections of Grace Abounding. There are no details here to guide us farther because the scope of the allegory is necessarily more limited than that of the autobio- graphy; the dreamer sees Christian from the start as an accused soul asking 'What shall I do to be saved ?', and there is no space for his natural life before this crisis. In the same way the allegory ends with his salvation, and has no time in between to show Christian as the guide and exhorter of others, whereas according to custom' Bunyan concludes his confessions with an account of his calling to the work of the ministry. Any treatment of pilgrims as pastors is left till Part Two. There the heroic figure of Great- heart suggests rather a reminiscence of Gifford, the first minister of the Bedford church who had received Bunyan into its communion, than a self- portrait; but the pastoral problems with which Greatheart has to deal are those which would be familiar to the author himself. Christian feels the terror of sin among his wife and children, who are unsympathetic. Indeed they think he has fallen into 'some frenzy dis- temper'. Christiana is not called till the beginning of Part Two. Likewise it was after he had 'changed his condition into a married state'z that Bunyan first began to concern himself over religion. In this case the relationship was reversed, a pious wife and a sinful husband. The difficulties of a mar- riage where only one partner had a strong urge to godliness receive atten- tion also in The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (168o), where Badman's first wife finds after a hypocritical courtship that she is tied to a reprobate. This problem of intermarriage with unbelievers was always arising in a minority sect with a strict standard of outward behaviour. We know little of Bunyan's first wife, and though he speaks of her piety with respect, it is significant that she had nothing to say of that central evangelical doctrine of reliance on Christ's blood alone which was to arouse him when he heard it from the lips of the poor women of Bedford. In fact, one passage about his wife, by its omission of any regard for the workings of the Spirit, lays her open to the charge of being a legalist:3 She also would be often telling of me, what a godly Man her Father was, and ' Cf. the form of Thomas Goodwin's autobiographical notes, Works (1704), v, pp. v-xix; The Life and Death of Mr. Vavasour Powell (1670). 2 ? 5. 3 Nothing is known of Bunyan's first marriage except for the brief mention of it in Grace Abounding. It presumably followed his army career which came to an end about July 1647 (Lords' Journals, ix. 343, for the disbanding of O'Hara's regiment). The marriage is not recorded in the parish register of Elstow which might suggest a ceremony before a Justice of the Peace under the Commonwealth. Dr. Brown was able to find little material for the years between Bunyan's demobilization and 1653.</page><page sequence="11">112 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) how he would reprove and correct Vice, both in his House, and amongst his Neighbours; what a strict and holy life he lived in his Days both in Word and Deed.' It looks as if there was more of works than faith in Bunyan's father-in-law, and in any case the effect on him was not to 'reach his heart' but to make him fall in with the religion of the times. He went through a period of outward reformation, though he did not at first abandon his swearing or leave off his fondness for sports in the churchyard till the terrible moment when a voice seemed to dart from heaven and say, 'Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?' During this period he attended church twice a day and showed great devotion to all the exter- nals of worship ; and all this time he was not sensible to the danger and evil of sin. He compares himself to the man who 'wearieth himself with vanity, for he knoweth not the way to the city of God' (Ecclesiastes x. 15). Even when he does become ashamed of his swearing and dips into the Bible, he takes most pleasure in the historical part: 'for Paul's epistles, and Scriptures of that nature, I could not away with them.' This was to the Puritan experienced in souls a sure sign of an unawakened heart. He has no understanding that for salvation righteousness must be imputed to him: 'I ... was going about to establish my own righteousness.'3 Now in the allegory Christian is shown at the start reading his Bible and experiencing a real conviction of sin. There is no preliminary period of legality. The story of the early groping of one who 'knoweth not the way to the city of God' falls outside the pilgrimage to that city. It is not till ? 46 of Grace Abounding, when Bunyan tells how he began to look into the Bible with new eyes and to find sweetness in the Pauline epistles, that a point is reached comparable to the situation of Christian when he meets Evangelist in the field. But in the second edition an episode was added which does something to represent in a typical character study this period of legal Christianity. This was the masterly sketch of Mr. Worldly Wise- man who tries to send Christian to the village of Morality to be helped off with his burden by 'a Gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man (and a man of a very good name)'. Bunyan does not disturb the dramatic suddenness of his beginning by introducing the episode there; he brings it in when Christian has received his instructions from Evangelist x Grace Abounding, ? 15. 2 His mention of 'a priest', 'clerk', and 'vestments' suggests an Anglican service, and since the Vicar of Elstow, Christopher Hall, got his living under Laud in 1639 and retained it at least two years after the Act of Uniformity, it is possible he never conformed to the pre- scriptions of the Solemn League and Covenant. But the sectary Bunyan might speak even of the dress of a Presbyterian minister as 'vestments' and of the forms of his service as if they were liturgical. ' ? 36.</page><page sequence="12">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 113 and is on his way towards the Wicket Gate. Christian is halted on his way to find Mr. Legality's house by an overhanging hill, which the marginal note explains is Mount Sinai, representing the condemnation of the old law: and also that side of it that was next the way did hang so much over, that Chris- tian was afraid to venture further, lest the Hill should fall on his head: ... There came also flashes of fire out of the Hill, that made Christian afraid that he should be burned.I He then re-encounters Evangelist who rebukes him and sets him in the right way again. This recalls one of the experiences which shook Bunyan out of his old habits during the period he spent, in Puritan phrase, 'under the law'. After giving up bell-ringing, in which he had taken great delight, he still used to stand in the steeple-house and look on, until the fear began to haunt him that one of the bells might fall. Then he went only to the steeple door until the fancy that the steeple itself might fall drove him away entirely.2 Thus the same feeling, a terror of an object falling from a height, connects the two incidents; and both incidents, the real experience and the piece of allegory, are illustrations of the same theological principle: how inexorable is the pressure of the Mosaic Law on the sinner who has not found grace. There is no question of a conscious modelling by Bunyan of the allegory on the autobiography; but he was drawing on the same store of personal experience for both, and sifting it through the same categories of Puritan psychology. In Grace Abounding there is no single sudden dawning of grace to wipe out entirely the darkness of unregeneracy; conversion is a long process of struggle, and so many are the crises of alternate exaltation and despair that it is difficult to distinguish separately the different stages recognized by Calvinist dogma-conviction of sin, effectual calling, assurance of grace, sanctification, and so on. In this Bunyan is closer to the facts of individual psychology than other Puritan spiritual autobiographers, who, though they usually describe a series of preliminary warnings and intimations of grace, often from sermons, and a long period of wrestling with temptation, tend to let the pattern of conversion they were traditionally acquainted with artificially order their experience. Bunyan lets the stages from legal Chris- tianity through conviction of sin to the 'dark night of the soul' which precedes illumination merge imperceptibly into each other. The most serious battles with temptation, taking up the whole central part of the book, came after Bunyan had received certain gifts of grace. So for Chris- tian the principal giants and monsters are met after he has passed the Cross. There is a clear turning-point when Bunyan saw that only the love of x The Pilgrim's Progress, ed.

This was when he listened to the poor women of Bedford sitting in the sun and 'talking about the things of God'.' He was led to a more earnest searching of the Bible, and then when he had perceived the prime necessity of faith, to doubting whether he possessed faith or not. The alien happiness of the elect of Bedford appeared to him 'in a dream or vision' at this time. They seemed to be on the sunny side of a high moun- tain, while he remained in frost and snow on the other side, prevented from reaching them by a wall: About this wall I thought myself to go again and again, still prying as I went, to see if I could find some way or passage, by which I might enter therein; but none could I find for some time. At the last, I saw, as it were, a narrow gap, like a little doorway in the Wall, through which I attempted to pass; Now the passage being very straight and narrow, I made many efforts to get in, but all in Vain, even until I was well nigh quite beat out, by striving to get in. At last, with great striving, methought I at first did get in my head, and after that, by a sideling striving my Shoulders and my whole Body. Then was I exceeding glad, and went and sat down in the midst of them, and so was comforted with the light and heat of their Sun.2 This is, of course, the theme of Matthew vii. 14: '. .. strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life', itself a summary of the whole allegory of The Pilgrim's Progress. Gospel imagery has sunk into Bunyan's consciousness. He had written a tract round this text during the third imprisonment, The Strait Gate, published in 1676. But, above this general parallel, the Wicket Gate to which Evangelist directs Christian resembles the door in the wall of the author's dream.3 Both are seen as the ways to desirable goals which cannot be reached immediately. The door needs some straining to get through, and the Slough of Despond and Wiseman's diversion intervene before Christian reaches the Gate. Also Bunyan glosses his dream with the explanation that the mountain is the Church, the wall the Word, and the gap in it Jesus Christ. Now though the Gate is opened by Goodwill in Part One, in Part Two 'the Keeper of the Gate' who admits Christiana and Mercy speaks in the role of Christ throughout the episode. For instance, to Mercy he says, 'I pray for all them that believe on me, by what means soever they come unto me'. It is not so easy to find the equivalent experience in Grace Abounding which corresponds to Christian's acceptance at the Wicket. It seems most satisfactory to consider the acceptance simply as marking the Chris- tian's entry into church fellowship with a community of believers. Bunyan became associated with Gifford's congregation during his first period of ' 37. 2 54. 'Matt, 7. 14' is noted in the margin in both cases.</page><page sequence="14">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 115 heart-searching and temptation.' Already he had undergone temptations of despair, less severe than the spiritual malaise which was to afflict him later. Immediately after his description of the vision of the door in the mountain separating him from the saved of Bedford, he goes on to tell of his doubts of his own election, springing from Romans ix. I6. This is indeed 'Dispond' and the physical character attached to this particular visitation (there is always such a sensory concomitant) is the sensation of sinking: 'I was often, when I have been walking, ready to sink where I went, with faintness in my mind.'2 And in a nearby passage, close to the section in which he mentions his associations with the Bedford church, he says, 'I found myself as on a miry bog that shook as I did but stir'.3 To combat this gnawing doubt he clung to the sentence: 'Look at the genera- tions of old and see: did any ever trust in the Lord, and was confounded ?' He was led to an intensive study of the Bible, right through from Genesis to Revelation, to see if he could find this saying. The phrase 'sitting under the ministry of holy Mr. Gifford' may indicate a closer relationship with Gifford about this time in which the pastor guided him through the Scrip- tures, no doubt applying to difficult texts that symbolical method of exegesis which was later codified by Benjamin Keach. And after the acceptance at the Wicket in The Pilgrim's Progress Christian's pilgrimage is interrupted by the static episode of the Interpreter's House, a treasury of emblematic pictures, not all biblical, but all supported by texts which show how Bunyan thought of the Bible as an allegory of truth in those places where the details taken at their face value seem without spiritual signifi- cance. In i688 he added a section to the sixth edition of Grace Abounding which makes quite clear that he was learning about such a mode of inter- pretation at this period. This was written after the composition of a second emblematic episode for the Second Part of The Pilgrim's Progress in 1684, after the appearance of Keach's volumes on Scripture metaphor in 1681-2 had revived the subject in Bunyan's mind: I was almost made, about this time, to see something concerning the beasts that Moses counted clean and unclean. I thought those Beasts were types of Men; the clean, types of them that were the people of God; but the unclean, types of such as were the children of the wicked One. Now, I read that the clean Beasts Chewed the cud; that is, thought I, they show us we must feed upon the Word of God. They also parted the Hoof; I thought that signified we must part, if we would be saved, with the ways of ungodly men.4 Thus Bunyan's acceptance into the Bedford church comes between a Slough of Despond and a period of concentration on the types and figures ' ??78, 118. 2z 62. ?3 83. 4 ? 71.

Any attempt to take some of the later moments of revelation in his confessions as a pattern for the entry through the Wicket Gate ignores not only this but the much closer resemblance of such moments to the momen- tous incidents at the Cross. IV Christian comes to the Cross from the Interpreter's House, and when he comes up with it the burden of sin which the law did nothing to lighten is wiped out by the sacrifice of Christ which imputes his own righteousness to the believer. At this point Christian knows he is justified, although doubts about his election appear later, in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and in Doubting Castle. In the same way Bunyan's initial anxieties were smoothed away by a confirmation of grace before his worst spiritual struggles took place. The progress of his conversion after his realization of what was needful and turning to the Bedford church was as follows: I. Conviction of sin. A profound understanding of his own imperfect nature, intensified after his introduction to Gifford. (Grace Abounding, ?? 78 if.) 2. A temporary gift of grace, prompted by a chance passage in a sermon, as in similar experiences of Goodwin and others. (?? 90-3.) 3. 'A very great storm' of temptations, heralded by his hearing the cry 'Simon, Simon', as described in ? 94. (?? 90-114.) 4. Effectual calling,' followed by a gradual restoration to grace. (??i 115-30.) 5. A second wave of temptations. At ? i99 this is spoken of as lasting two and a half years. The climax of this was when Bunyan thought he had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost by denying Christ. He was subsequently haunted for months by a text from Hebrews xii. 17, concerning Esau: 'For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.' (?? 132- 235, followed by an analysis of the temptation, ?? 236-52.) 6. A final assurance of grace, preceded by 'a great cloud of darkness' which was accompanied by physical weakness. The highest pitch of exaltation is reached in a vision embodying a passage from Hebrews xii about the company of the saints. This gave Bunyan a picture of a I That this is what takes place at this stage is confirmed by what Bunyan says later: 'I was perswaded that those who were once effectually in Christ, as I hoped, through his Grace, I had seen myself, could never lose him for ever....' ? 135.</page><page sequence="16">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 117 whole band of the elect passing into the New Jerusalem, like that presented in the closing scenes of Part Two when the pilgrims cross the river. (?? 253-64.) The fourth stage, that of effectual calling, is introduced in terms closely parallel to the account of Christian's experience at the Cross. Bunyan was travelling into the country, meditating on the hostility of his heart towards God, when the scripture came into his mind, 'He has made peace by the Blood of his Cross' (Col. i. zo). 'This was a good day to me; I hope I shall not forget it.' He now had comfortable assurances concerning all the great truths of Christ's life, and says of his meditation on the resurrec- tion: 'I have seen as if he leaped at the Grave's mouth for joy that he was risen again, and had got the conquest over our dreadful foes.'I This recalls the connexion of the Cross with the Sepulchre in The Pilgrim's Progress. The climax of this fourth stage is described as follows: 'Now had I an evidence, as I thought, of my Salvation from Heaven, with many golden Seals thereon, all hanging in my sight... .'2 This is followed by his acknow- ledgement of the counsel he derived at this period from Luther's Commen- tary on Galatians, which provided the very phrasing for a later revelation when he heard the words 'Thy Righteousness is in heaven'. The House Beautiful is, like the Interpreter's House, a static episode breaking into the movement of conversion from stage to stage which follows the plan of Grace Abounding so consistently. Some critics have seen in the episode an idealized picture of the Bedford church, and this may well be the case. Its faintly ecclesiastical tone is alien to the stark religious individualism of the rest of Part One; it looks forward to the more social atmosphere of the Second Part, where the House Beautiful is only one of many places of rest which refresh Christiana and her troop with communal pleasures. It does, however, afford an opportunity for the illus- tration of one of the great stock metaphors of Puritan preaching-the Christian warfare, based on St. Paul's words about the whole armour of God (Eph. vi). This is when Prudence, Piety, and Charity take Christian into the armoury and harness him from head to foot 'with what was of proof, lest perhaps he should meet with assaults in the way'. Thus armed, Christian goes down the hill into the Valley of Humilia- tion. This valley, and its neighbour, the Valley of the Shadow of Death, provide the strongest spiritual terrors of his pilgrimage, apart from the im- prisonment in Doubting Castle. What he suffers at the hands of men in Vanity Fair does not belong to the saga of conversion. But this part of S?? xI 6, 122. 2 ? 129.

Christian says to Apollyon, 'I have obtained my Pardon of my Prince'.</page><page sequence="17">118 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) Christian's experience, the persecution when men shall revile him and say all manner of evil to him, does find a place at the end of Grace Abounding in our modern editions. Bunyan's own story of his arrest under the Eliza- bethan Conventicle Act in i66o, his examination before the justices, his trial and imprisonment, was never published with the rest of his autobio- graphy in his lifetime. It would no doubt have stood little chance of finding a printer, being liable to be misconstrued as an incentive to hold illegal con- venticles. The manuscript was handed down by the Bunyan family and finally printed by James Buckland in 1765. Bunyan faced Keeling and Chester at the assizes with the same bold confidence in the righteousness of his cause which inflamed Faithful to martyrdom at Vanity Fair, before Lord Hate-good and a packed jury containing Mr. Blind-mind, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, and Mr. Implacable. The parallel with the trial scenes in The Holy War' is even fuller, but there is no doubt that Bunyan's personal experiences gave him material for both. The two periods of great spiritual danger in Christian's journey after he leaves the House Beautiful, the time from his entry into the Valley of Humiliation to his meeting with Faithful and his imprisonment with Hopeful in Doubting Castle, correspond to the third and fifth stages of Bunyan's conversion noticed above. However, all the typical characteris- tics of his worst hallucinations are drawn on for the imagery of the Valley of the Shadow of Death. The devil who whispers many grievous blas- phemies into his ear, the sensation of being pursued, the general darkness, recalling Bunyan's reiterated statement that in these moods of despair all sensible things became disgusting to him-all are present. The debate and battle with Apollyon resemble the temptation described in ?? 107-10. In both the tempter asks his victim to transfer his obedience from God to Satan, who is his original master; in The Pilgrim's Progress the idea of feudal allegiance to a lord, with the claim of a rival lord on the vassal's services, is employed. This leads up to a pitched battle of the St. George and the Dragon type, emotionally in keeping with the characterization of Christian as a loyal knight. In the background is the text: 'No man can serve two masters'. Bunyan, during the period he has described as 'a very great storm', was also tormented by thoughts urging him to transfer his allegiance completely to the evil powers: Sometimes, also, he would cast in such wicked thoughts as these: Matt. 4. 9. that I must pray to him, or for him. I have thought sometimes of that-Fall down, or if thou wilt fall down and worship me. The theological seriousness of the other great temptation episode, that of Doubting Castle, is perhaps somewhat obscured for us by the brisk I The Holy War, ed. Brown (Cambridge, 1905), PP. 301-I4.</page><page sequence="18">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS 119 folk-tale method of Bunyan's analysis. The despair which seizes Christian and Hopeful is that spiritual malaise which eats away the hope of salvation. It is just such a disease which beset the author in the fifth stage of his con- version. This attack followed immediately after the peace and confidence given him by his assurance of grace, a type of swift transition familiar in the narratives of mystical experience. Only a short while before he had had 'evidence of my Salvation from Heaven, with many golden Seals thereon'. In the same way Christian and Hopeful, after easily spurning the evils of Demas, spend some time in great comfort by the River of the Water of Life, 'which David the King called the River of God', as it runs by the pilgrims' way. This is meant to signify that at this stage a certain amount of spiritual solace is afforded to them. But soon, as with Bunyan in his early days, the way becomes hard again; quiet contemplation of the joys of heaven is succeeded by restless self-examination: 'Now I beheld in my Dream, that they had not journied far, but the River and the way, for a time, parted. At which they were not a little sorry, yet they durst not go out of the way.'I But soon they are drawn to find what they think is a better way in By-Path Meadow, and fall into the hands of Giant Despair. In the parallel section of the autobiography Bunyan is first haunted by a voice inciting him to give up Christ. The voice seems to murmur, 'Sell him, sell him.' At last a moment comes when he feels that he has given in to these promptings and inwardly answered, 'Let him go.' The most terrible re- morse follows-has he betrayed Christ like Judas ? Is this the sin against the Holy Ghost? Again and again in his account of these reflections Bunyan repeats the text which weighed most on his spirit: 'For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears' (Hebrews xii. I7). This experience has a peculiar interest, because, unlike his other trials, it seems even in Bunyan's view to have been caused by a misunderstanding playing into Satan's hands rather than an objective assault by the powers of darkness. The chief point was that Bunyan was mistaken; he never surrendered Christ voluntarily, and he adds a long disquisition to his account, aimed at those as inexperienced in spiritual matters as he then was, on how he arrived in this situation. The conclusion is that though he erred at the beginning in not praying for divine aid against temptations to come, he had not fully understood how the promises of God's covenant with him ruled out the possibility of his repentance being rejected (? 248). Yet he allowed the continually resounding text from Hebrews to hold such a rejection over him. The circumstances of the Doubting Castle episode where they clash with its adventure story frame- work are very similar. Christian carries the key to the prison all the time I The Pilgrim's Progress, ed. Brown, p. 233.</page><page sequence="19">120 R.E.S., VOL. 24, 1948 (NO. 94, APRIL) but does not think of it; that is, 'the Promises' (G.A. ? 248) had never really forsaken him. In this same analysis of this temptation in Grace Abounding, he uses the metaphor of a key when pointing out the advantages of his sufferings-a deeper understanding of the power of Scripture: The Scriptures now also were wonderful things unto me. I saw that the truth and verity of them were the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; those that the Scriptures favour, they must inherit bliss; but those that they oppose and con- demn must perish evermore. (? 246.) Now did my Chains fall off my Legs indeed; I was loosed from my Affliction and Irons; my Temptations also fled away.... (? 231.) Interestingly enough Bunyan revised the text of both autobiography and allegory with great care at this point. The description of Doubting Castle was greatly expanded in the second edition where the whole business of Mrs. Diffidence and her counsels as well as details of the Giant's treatment of his prisoners were added.' Finally, in their view from the Delectable Mountains, when the pilgrims have made their escape from Doubting Castle and are in the company of the shepherds, some of the victims of the Giant are pointed out to them: they perceived, as they thought, several men walking up and down among the Tombs that were there. And they perceived that the men were blind, because they stumbled sometimes upon the Tombs, and because they could not get out from among them.z Bunyan is working into a grim picture a hint from Proverbs xxi. 16: 'The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.' Christian and Hopeful look at each other in silence when the shepherds point out that these are strayers in By-Path Meadow who did not escape the Giant. And Bunyan describes his own suffering when he thought he had yielded to the supreme blasphemy in exactly the same terms: O the unthought of imaginations, frights, fears, and terrors, that are effected by a thorough application of guilt leading to desperation. This is the man that hath his dwelling among the tombs with the dead, that is always crying out and cutting himself with stones.3 So close are the correspondences between the spiritual biography and that side of The Pilgrim's Progress, predominant in the First Part, which sets out the religious history of the individual soul. x Cf. the expansion of the conversation with By-ends, Ist ed., pp. 170-3, where additional particulars of his kindred are given in later editions. 2 The Pilgrim's Progress, ed.
