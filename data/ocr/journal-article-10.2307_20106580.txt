<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carol Radcliffe Bol?n, Forms of the goddess Lajj? Gaur? in Indian art. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1997. xiv + 162 pp. Carol Bolon has written the most comprehensive study to date of the iconographie forms of Lajj? Gaur?, the name most widely used in modem India for a Hindu goddess whose historical name still remains unknown. Lajj? Gaur? images are striking since they generally depict a headless, nude female lying on her back with her legs spread and bent at the knees, in a position suggestive of both sexual readiness and giving birth. Found particularly in central India and rendered in stone relief or terra cotta, the images range from a mere two inches to larger than life size. Following Stella Kramrisch, Bolon argues that the Sanskrit word utt?napad, meaning 'one whose legs are extended in parturition,' best describes the image. Also, the commonly applied epithet, 'nude-squatting goddess,' is inaccurate since Lajj? Gaur? does not generally squat but almost always lies supine. Bolon further points out that Lajj? Gaur?'s name is often mistranslated as 'Shameless goddess' rather than 'Gaur?, goddess without reason for shame.' Bolon begins by defining four iconographie categories of Lajj? Gaur? images. These range from the minimally anthropomorphic Form I (utt?napad pot forms), through Forms II and III (lotus-headed images without and with arms), to the completely anthropomor phic goddesses of Form IV. Her study, accompanied by 130 clear photographic plates, is based on an examination of 124 images of the goddess and highlights iconographie features, regional peculiarities, and chronology. She notes that the utt?napad pot forms of the goddess are most abundant in the south and belong to the third and fourth century. The full-torsoed, armless, lotus-headed Form II figures, predominantly found in Maharashtra, derive from the fourth to the ninth century. The Form III figures, with human bodies and lotus heads, date from the fourth to the tenth century. Form IV figures are exclusive to the north and are chronologically late. All forms of Lajj? Gaur? are also found depicted on carved plaques, accompanied by other figures, such as a bull, a lihga, and a lion. These plaques, Bolon suggests, reveal that by the fourth century Lajj? Gaur? had become incorporated into the Hindu pantheon as an adjunct to the triad of male gods, Brahma, Visnu, and Siva. She was especially coupled with Siva, as his Sakti. Utilizing F. Bosch's notion of 'resemblance-elaboration,' particularly useful in the study of symbol development, Bolon next examines related iconographie forms which were incorporated into images of Lajj? Gaur?, the most relevant being the lotus, the brimming pot, and the mark of fortune (sr?vatsa).</page><page sequence="2">276 / International Journal of Hindu Studies 2, 2 (1998) Within her concluding arguments, Bolon suggests that Lajj? Gaur? likely emerged first as an aniconic tribal or local village deity whose earliest form, one which continues to endure to the present, was a pot. Later elaborations, such as the distinctive legs in utt?napad pose, breasts, and lotus flower heads, are consistent with her functions as a fertility goddess. She is 'the elemental source of all life, animal and plant,...and is the source of Fortune. She personifies the sap of life..the vivifying element embodied in water, the support of all life' (6). Subsequently, Lajj? Gaur? underwent a progressive anthropomorphism and eventually was incorporated into the Hindu pantheon. Bolon argues that the appearance of Form III figures at various times in select regions (for example, highly refined forms during the Early C?lukya period [seventh century] in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) suggest both royal patronage and Br?hmanization of the goddess. By the tenth century, full anthropomorphism was commonplace, and Lajj? Gaur? lost her most distinctive iconographie features. Abstract linear Tantric symbols of the yoni, worshipped for fertility, may have replaced her symbolic function. Iconographie representations of Lajj? Gaur? seem to vanish by the eleventh century. Bolon's study is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Lajj? Gaur?, whose images had never heretofore received a thorough cross-regional analysis. It is a necessary addition to library collections and recommended reading to all with specific interests in South Asian iconography and goddess worship traditions. I, for instance, noted intriguing parallels between the historic development of Lajj? Gaur? icons and aspects of the Durg? P?j?, a contemporary ritual in which the goddess Durg? is worshipped in a variety of forms, including a pot, an anthropomorphic clay image, and abstract Tantric symbols.
