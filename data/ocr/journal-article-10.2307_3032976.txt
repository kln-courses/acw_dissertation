<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Social Psychology of No-ua Primates? J.K. CHADWICK-JONES The author is professor of psychology at Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Canada. A few years ago, while reading some of the works of Claude Levi-Strauss, I came across his discussion in Elementary Structures of Kinship (1949) of the contributions of child psychology to our understanding of adult social exchange. He cited the studies of young children by Susan Isaacs, especially because of the insights they gave into the way children resolve their disagreements. In his subsequent books Levi-Strauss did not return to this theme, but he reiterated the postulate of a human genetic substratum underlying all reciprocal behaviour. From there, my search for more discussion of the origins of social exchange took me into the ethological and eventually into the primatological literature. I was surprised to find that a few contemporary researchers, either reporting on empirical studies or referring to them, were citing social exchange ideas, borrowed mainly from social psychology, in order to explain the behaviour they had observed in monkeys and apes. This was something of a paradox. In leaving aside my normal field of study - social psychology - in order to explore primatological research, I had not anticipated finding the concepts from social psychology that were being applied by analogy to the understanding of primate behaviour. It suggested to me the need for an answer to the question 'Could there really be a social psychology for non-human primates?'. An affirmative answer would mean that there is social behaviour for which evolutionary explanations are not sufficient or which cannot altogether be understood by sociobiology. Complex human cultural forms provide obvious obstacles to a purely sociobiological explanation, but what of the case of monkeys and apes? There are some well-known examples of learned behaviour that is handed on e.g. washing potatoes by monkeys, but they seem too rudimentary to support a 'social psychology' of non-human primates. Human social psychology presupposes an elaborate cognitive and behavioural area of study and its connections to biology are not directly demonstrable. For some sociobiologists, 'proximate' explanations are inconsequential; by this view, there would not be much scope in primatology for social psychological explanations or for any explanations if they did not rely on evolutionary theory and natural selection for their scientific validity. Several reasons suggest that the answer may be positive. First, there are the similarities in non-human primate behaviour to the human. This gives a validity at first sight which is so convincing for investigators of monkeys' or chimpanzees' social behaviour that terminology used to describe human behaviour is liberally borrowed, despite occasional misgivings about anthropomorphism (although Japanese studies have traditionally taken a more openly sociological view). A second reason for having a social psychology of non-human primates lies in the variations we expect in the social behaviour of a species, some of them non- adaptative, over a range that is not completely determined by evolutionary pressures. Natural selection operates through variation and there is also the phenomenon of 'genetic drift', when restricted sampling produces a chance range of social and other behaviour that is not tied down to explanations in terms of reproductive success; and social behaviour may 'drift' into distinctive forms in small populations. Variations in social behaviour between troops of monkeys could also be due to differences in the immediate environment (social structures vary with habitat); or else because of differences in age/sex ratios and the number of generations and juveniles, which are all factors influencing relationships and alliances. So, explanations in terms of evolutionary strategies may not totally cover the subject matter. A third reason relates to the time-scale needed for tracking evolutionary effect. Social behaviour in the short-term (observational studies usually last for weeks or months) can be 'understood' in a different sense to 'understanding' in the evolutionary time-scale. This is the area for proximate explanations where, to give an example, the social behaviour of monkeys A and B on one occasion is understood because of events in their relationships with each other on a previous occasion. Recent descriptions show chimpanzees settling old scores and switching alliances with almost Machiavellian cunning; the explanations used in these instances are proximate ones and all else is conjectural. At least one investigator goes so far as to cite cite Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) Social Psychology of Groups in support of his views on social exchange between chimpanzees. No doubt, the social psychology of non-human primates can be accepted as an area of proximate explanations that are not inconsistent with the supposed objective of maximizing contributions to the gene pool and that can be reconciled, logically, with evolutionary theory. The complex integrated analysis of biological systems that sociobiologists see as providing (eventually) the way to understanding social behaviour, does not share its scientific framework (some sociobiologists have stated this plainly) with the proximate explanations of a social psychology for primates. But as things are (and as they seem likely to stay) the only kind of reduction that is possible from proximate to ultimate explanations is no more than a logical reduction - achieved by the mere statement that observed social behaviour appears to be consistent with maximizing contributions to the gene pool (improving genetic fitness). Primatologists continually make such statements anyway - hoping to win, by doing so, the imprimatur of scientific respectability. From a sociobiologist's point of view, the trouble with social psychology (and sociology) is that the explanations these disciplines offer do not have the backing of evolutionary or adaptationist theory.

There may be additional misunderstandings, because there is no unified body of theory in these disciplines. Divisions exist, such as those between individualist or collectivist orientations in theories which may also be implicitly political in their interpretations of contemporary social behaviour. As things are, some researchers might be tempted to ignore the social psychology altogether and to do no more by way of explanation than attach plausible evolutionary conjectures to the discussion of whatever is observed. Even further problems arise because of that part of the subject-matter under study which concerns intersubjectivity among monkeys and apes. Observers can only make inferences, from descriptions of overt behaviour, about possible intentions and the meaning of social acts of monkeys and apes. For example, the question 'what does this act mean?' is well illustrated in discussions of infants being used as 'buffers' in conflicts between male baboons, where an adult picks up either his own or his opponent's infant. There are several possible meanings of this: in the former case it may not only provide a 'buffer' but may signify intention to fight or it may be that the infant is picked up for its protection as 'genetic investment'. Additionally, the infant may be not any infant but belongs to a female grooming partner and since the grooming relationship ('alliance') has considerable reproductive importance as a protection for the female, she will be likely to intervene on the side of the male. Sometimes an infant jumps onto the back of one of the contesting males: is the benefit for this active participation a later alliance with the adult male? Such questions on the meaning of social acts do not necessarily find their complete answer in restatements of the evolutionary logic, insofar as we want to know what these acts mean within a given social context and what their consequences are for the other animals over the short term. This suggests scope for a narrow band of social psychological explanations. Analogies with human social psychology may be useful, as has been found with explanations of social grooming (allogrooming) connecting this activity with alliances or coalitions. The analogy to human social exchange has repeatedly been made. Among monkeys and apes the physical act of grooming is frequently shown to be also a social act of appeasement, soothing a potential aggressor. Grooming serves to integrate individuals into a social structure and to confirm alliances; the distress calls of grooming partners are heeded more than those of non-partners. Grooming has been shown to work as a tit-for-tat strategem or even as a 'pass-through tax' when grooming is directed to an adult male obstructing a pathway. A variety of similar evidence exists. But there are important further issues, not so much over the meaning of the behaviour but over which of the available theories in human social psychology is most adequate. In fact, it may not be the entrepreneurial view of exchange that is most useful so much as an anthropological view of social exchange which emphasizes the social and material conditions influencing how and with whom reciprocal relationships take place. Some primatologists locate the origins of social exchange in maternal behaviour, a view that could well supplant the Hobbesian political theory assumed as a background by many social psychologists. Despite the possibilities for the interpretation of primate behaviour such as we have mentioned in relation to social grooming there will always be severe limitations (and that is why I have referred to a 'narrow band') on the study of an intersubjectivity that is without language. Yet the analogies and similarities to human social behaviour are insistent and call out for more explicit theoretical treatment as a social psychology as well as a sociobiology. I have suggested why there is a favourable case for a social psychology of non-human primates. Acceptance of a favourable case would raise several major problems for primatologists. There is no meta-theory backing, as there is for explanations within the framework of evolutionary theory. And which social psychological theory might be most suitable? It is a difficult question and I shall leave it unanswered; but at least the question moves discussion away from empiricist ideas that still circulate and mislead investigators into thinking that the data collected have primacy over the theories that influence which data are collected for study. Sherman and Austin, two male chimps using a portable keyboard to request foods outdoors on a 'cookout' and helping to put kitchen utensils away, from E. Sue Savage- Rumbaugh's Ape Language: from Conditioned Response to Symbol (Oxford UP., ?30). This is a development of the famous project by RT and R.A. Gardner to teach Washoe, another chimpanzee, American Sign Language, which was comprehensively debunked by Thomas A. Sebeok and Jean Umiker-Sebeok in Speaking of Apes (Plenum, 1980 - see RAIN 39, Aug. 1980, 'Sebeok's Pince-Nez'and review by M Redshaw, 41, Dec. 1980). Savage-Rumbaugh adopts a centrist position on the ape-language controversy, arguing that the productive question to ask is not whether apes have full language competence as we know it in humans, but what facets of language are found in non-human forms, and in what circumstances. A possible application of the new research is in teaching language to mentally retarded children.
