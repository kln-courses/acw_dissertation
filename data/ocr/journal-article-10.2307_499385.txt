<plain_text><page sequence="1">GANDHARA AND LATE ANTIQUE ART: THE BUDDHA IMAGE LATE Antique art, particularly in its provincial manifestations, represents a phase of artistic expression significant not only for its intrinsic aesthetic merit, which, con- trary to popular opinion, is sometimes considerable, but also for its revelation of a period of culture when the old classic humanistic values were locked in a death struggle with the dynamic and overwhelming forces of Oriental and barbarian art, a struggle that was to end with the victorious emergence of mighty and new spiritual forces that produced Mediaeval art in the West and the great and truly ghostly beauty of developed Buddhist art in India and the Far East. Classic art, which held a mirror to catch the familiar, friendly face of nature, was no more compatible with Oriental art and its endless yearnings after the other world than it was with the fan- tastic and dynamic imaginings of the barbarian soul in Gaul and Britain. In Gandhara art we have the same spectacle of classical forms endeavoring vainly to express in material terms the ideals of an immaterial religion that we have in the attempts of the Early Christian sculptors to adopt the Graeco-Roman forms so unsuited to their spiritual ideals. Herein lie the reasons why classical art could not survive in a world whose thoughts were beyond Nature and the accidental beauty of the human form. And it is precisely as an exemplar of this universal process involving the death of classical art and the rebirth of spiritual and really traditional thought in art that the much-maligned Graeco-Buddhist school of Gandhara is of particularly vital import: to understand fully its r61le in the last great struggle between East and West we must first know its precise chronology and its relation to the world of western art in the early centuries of the Christian era. In an earlier article on Gandhdra sculpture, the writer has analyzed at consider- able length the chronological and stylistic evolution of this hybrid school of Late Antique sculpture in northwestern India and Afghanistan.' On the basis of further research it is now possible to consolidate the opinions expressed there on the rela- tions between Gandhdra and the Roman Empire; as will be indicated in the course of this study, certain modifications of earlier hypotheses are in order. For the sake of unity, the present essay will concern itself only with the Buddha image, although the author has in preparation for publication yet other striking similarities in types and techniques that confirm even more strongly the intimate relationship between the Graeco-Roman school in India and the art of the late classical world. Although it is undeniable that there is evidence for the existence of a provincial Hellenistic or Graeco-Parthian art in northern India in the second and first centuries B.C., it appears more and more certain to the present writer that this final and slight legacy of Alexander's successors in Bactria had only a very minor influence on the later Graeco-Roman school of Gandhira. On the basis of actual inscribed fragments and remains found under reliable archaeological conditions, there is every indication that the Gandhara school of SB.

THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA</page><page sequence="2">224 BENJAMIN ROWLAND, JR. sculpture came into existence before the reign of Kaniska (198-160 A.D.). Consid- ered as part of the stylistic development of the Late Antique world, there is every reason to suppose that the great majority of these so-called Graeco-Buddhist carv- ings are the result of a sudden and intensive mass production that began no earlier than the second century A.D. and was almost entirely the work of artisans imported from the Roman East; the "best" phase of this style corresponds to Roman and Syrian work of the time of Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus; later, it con- tinues to reflect the final stages of classic sculpture in the fourth and fifth centuries; and ultimately it is reabsorbed into the Indian tradition. An omnipresent factor in Gandhara sculpture is the necessarily non-realistic, abstract quality of Indian re- ligious art which both contends with and ultimately supersedes the classical ele- ment, just as the ferocious and dynamic strength of barbarian design prevailed over antique naturalism in Europe. The first Buddha images to be made in northwestern India that are in every re- spect under Late Antique influence are dated in the late second and early third cen- turies A.D. All of the examples before this, and they are few enough, belong to an "archaic" phase of Gandhara art that was in a way simply an extension of the old Indian school of sculpture to the northwest frontier.2 The two Buddha images, illustrated in figs. I and Q, which belong to this category, are of the greatest significance for this investigation, because we know the exact years of their dedication. These statues, from the sites of Loriyan Tangai and Hashtnagar (Chdrsada), have on their bases inscriptions referring to the 318th and 384th year of an unspecified era.3 Vogel 4 and Bachhofer,5 taking this to refer to the Seleucid era of 312 B.C., have dated them at 6 and 72 A.D. respectively; Foucher, applying an otherwise unknown "Maurya era," beginning in 3Q22 B.C., decided that the idols were made in 4 B.C. and 62 A.D.6 As I have shown elsewhere,' there is no foundation for the use of either of these methods of reckoning in Indian chronology and a more likely era would be the Saka era of 150 B.C., so that the images could be dated in 168 and 234 A.D.8 A recent investigator of the problem, N. G. Majumdar, has even suggested the possibility that we have to do with the Vikrama (iM'alava) era of 58 B.C.: the two Buddhas would then be placed in 260 and 326 A.D.9 I believe it will be demonstrated by the comparisons to be made with Late Antique sculpture that only the two last possibilities can be seriously considered in fixing a proper date for these statues. Before arriving at any definite conclusions, let us first examine the style of the statues themselves. In figure 1, the fragment from Loriyan Tafigai, we see a standing Buddha figure, lacking head and hands and otherwise badly damaged; the canon of the proportions, were the statue complete, must have been something like five 2 Rowland, op. cit., pp. 391 ff. 3 J.

The garment has a hardness and stiffness that makes it look as though it had been hammered out of metal and is a far cry from the soft, clinging togas of the Hellenistic and Augustan periods. In the other Buddha image, which is sixty-four years later, the scheme of the folds is even more clearly readable. The most distinctive feature of the drapery of this and innumerable other Gandhara statues is the drapery of the upper robe which falls - or, rather, hangs - in a stiff apron in front of the legs. This part of the garment is carved in a definite formula of rigid folds that in cross-section form a billowing pat- tern, but have very little to do with any actual drapery. The Gandhara sculptors seem to have elaborated a very rigid formula of drapery design: almost invariably, as can be seen in the Charsada figure and in the almost identical figure in Worcester (fig. 3), there is a series of five to eleven major folds of ridges below the waist that protrude like ribs against the dark background. This convention, even to the number of folds, is repeated over and over again so that, although carved from stone, the draperies might have been cast from an identical mould. This technique strongly sug- gests the presence of copy books, or compendiariae, within the guilds that wrought these statues. If we search for classical prototypes for this treatment of drapery, it will be apparent at once that we have to do with a development beyond the naturalistic presentation of a garment with easy, free and form-revealing folds that is character- istic of the Hellenistic period and of the carving of drapery in Roman art of the first century of our era. Taking into account the disparities arising from the way the FIG. 3. - BUDDHA, WORCESTER ART MUSEUM, WORCESTER, MASS.</page><page sequence="5">GANDHARA AND LATE ANTIQUE ART 227 costume was worn, the robes of the Gandhara Buddhas may be compared very well to the togas of the Roman Imperial statues. In the first place, the conception of the drapery is in both cases totally different from the function of the garment in Hel- lenistic sculpture: in a statue like the Sophocles of the Lateran - chosen as a typical Hellenistic draped figure- the robe models and defines the body, although it has a definite volume of its own. In the portrait statues of the early Imperial period, as, for example, the Marcus Calatorius from Herculaneum and the bronze Mammius Maximus, there is a continuation of the Greek tendency to consider the drapery as a separate volume, something almost detached and playing little part in defining the body beneath: it is more like a deeply indented and dramatically arranged curtain hung in front of the figure.1' The "Baroque" depth of the relief and the theatrical swing of the long, weighted folds reaches its culmination in a bronze statue from Ponte Sisto."1 It is precisely from Roman draped portraits such as these that the Buddhas of Charsada and Loriyan Tafigai ultimately derive. The treatment of drap- ery as a sort of "shield" in front of the body is well illustrated in the various reliefs of the Nirvana. In these, although the Buddha is in a recumbent position, the folds of the robe are carved as for a standing figure.12 The Charsada image may further, however, be more directly compared to a second-century portrait in the Museo delle Terme in Rome.13 Indeed, the earliest really close parallel for this detail of Gandhara art is to be found in the reliefs of the Monument of Marcus Aurelius (161-180 A.D.) in the Museo dei Conservatori in Rome.'4 The schematization of the draperies in the figures of this relief is simply a further development of the tendencies already ex- amined in the statues of the first century A.D. Taking into consideration the differ- ences in costumes (toga and saifghati), it will be noted that the actual carving of the folds is remarkably similar: there is the same reduction of the garment to a series of ridges disposed in repeated parabolic loops; the crests of these ribs of drapery tend to be on the same plane. These tendencies become even more pronounced in the re- liefs from the time of Septimius Severus (197-211 A.D.), notably the panel on the interior jamb of the arch of the money-changers and in certain individual figures from the arch in the Forum.15 One could add to these a statue of Marcus Aurelius in the British Museum.16 In all of these the drapery descends in a great cascade, with the border of the mantle raised so that it almost appears as a heavy swag separate from the rest of the garment, a feature that immediately suggests the deep trough of drapery that we have seen in the Gandhara statues. An even closer parallel can be found in the drapery of the figures on the Asiatic sarcophagi, especially the frag- 10 R. Paribeni, I1 ritratto nell'arte antica, Milan, 1934, Tav. CLXVIII; K.

In this we have a speci- men of ribbed drapery, very close indeed to the Graeco-Buddhist convention. It was apparently from prototypes such as these that the first generations of Eurasian craftsmen in Gandhara developed the peculiarly limited formula that has been described above. With this latter comparison, the question is raised for the first time whether or not Gandhara art is an offshoot of Hellenistic sculpture in the East or whether we can say that it was influenced by Roman Imperial art. As will be apparent in the examination of a second type of Gandhara drapery, both of these premises are true. There is nothing in the art of northwestern India of the first century A.D. to indicate an independent development towards either of the two forms in question: in other words, both the style of carving the toga in Imperial Rome of the second century and the even more abstract formulae developed in Asia Minor and Syria were introduced almost simultaneously -introduced presumably at a time when Roman trade with India was flourishing and to meet the demands for imagery in the revived Buddhism of Gandhara. This second type of drapery mentioned above is represented by a large number of Gandhara statues: in these the folds are reduced to a series of strings, sometimes radiating from the left shoulder, sometimes falling in a succession of loops down the median line of the body, and in every case suggesting more a surface ornament than the definition of a real garment and its structure. The principal specimens of this type have been found at Paitavi and Begram (fig. 4), in the vicinity of the ancient Kdpi'a in central Afghanistan.s" To this class of sculpture there belongs also the 175- foot Buddha at BBamiyan.19 We do know that this type of drapery found its way into the sculpture of the Gupta period at Mathura, as evidenced by a dated image in the museum at Luck- now: the statue is from the Katra mound at Mathura and is dated in the 230th year of Gupta or 549-550 A.D.20 Are the Afghan statues as late as this, or is there any evi- dence for dating them earlier than the appearance of this form in Indian art? Both the Charsada Buddha of 234 A.D. and another dated statue of Q?16 A.D. from Mamane Dheri show this type of string drapery almost fully evolved.21 However, the evidence for dating all of the Afghan sites is extremely fragmentary and unsatisfactory: 22 the reliefs at Begram were found together with large quantities of Syrian glass of 17 C.

How much earlier they could be is a vexing question. By comparison with Gandhara statues, the smaller figure might be as early as the third century. It is not without relation to the statues of Loriydn Tanigai and Chdrsada. The larger (175-foot) colossus at Bamiya-n is the largest speci- men of this - here, literally - "string" drapery, for, as M. Hackin has described it: "On the right thigh of the great Buddha the holes for the wooden pegs which sup- ported the mortar (of which the drapery was made) still form a dotted line, indicat- ing the original course of the folds of the monastic garments. Cords were stretched from one peg to the next and these cords are still to be seen in places. These pegs and cords served as a support for the lime mortar coating. In the spots where this support still remains, the drapery resembles padded ridges arranged in parallel lines from the left shoulder, diverging, however, from the parallel toward the centre of the breast to curve upward and return toward the right shoulder." 26 What appear to be Chinese imitations of this system of drapery are found in dated bronze images of 443 and 486 A.D.21 and in the attendant figures in Cave 18 and Cave 99 at Yiin Kang,28 although in these the actual folds are flat and ribbon-like and not padded as in the Indian examples. The statue in Cave 18 at Ytiin Kang is dated 489 A.D., and the standing Bodhisattva of Cave 22 is probably to be dated shortly after the beginning of Tan Yao's activity in 454 A.D. Therefore, since both in style and in the concept of the gigantic Buddha as Mahapurusa, equivalent to the universe itself, the colossi of Yiin Kang are modelled on the great statues at Bdmiydn, it must be assumed that these latter must be earlier than 450 A.D. :29 the Begram and Paitaivd figures, which are identical in style with the larger Buddha at Bimiyan, must then date from this same period.3A The reduction of the classic drapery to a web of parallel padded pleats, frequently in bifurcated formations, that is so popular in Gandhara sculpture,.is nothing new in the Middle East: it makes its appearance in a terracotta by the artist Menophilos, which may be dated in the first century A.D.3'1 Something of the same system may be seen in the figurines from Seleucia, which have been dated in the first century of our era and later.32 It seems unlikely, however, that the style should have had its origin 25 Sir J.

Postponing for the moment the in- stances of this technique in Palmyra, we may find a suggestion of the fa- miliar padded loops as early as the first century B.C. in the monument of Nimrud Dagh 33 and again in the Par- thian bronze statues recently discov- ered at Shami in southwestern Iran.34 Stein, Godard, and Picard have all attributed these monumental bronzes to the Parthian period: certainly the resemblances of the head of the larg- est statue to the coin portraits of the Arsacid rulers seems to confirm such an attribution, which is further sup- ported by the style of dress and the resemblance of the work as a whole to the few known examples of Parthian relief sculpture. A possible additional evidence for the dating of the Shami bronzes was the discovery with these Parthian royal statues of a Roman bronze head in a style strongly suggest- ing the portraiture characteristic of the period from the Republic to Augustus - approximately the time of the birth of Christ.35 This type of drapery is not present in the sculptures of 39 A.D., on the frieze of the temple of Bel at Pal- myra, but examples of it become more and more numerous in the grave re- liefs of the first and second centuries from this site:36" 1 mention only a frag- ment from Kasr-el-Abiad, dated 100- 150 A.D. by M.

Before taking up the question of the relation of the Near Eastern monuments just mentioned to the reliefs of Gandhqra, it is necessary to say something of the history of this peculiar drapery form. As the present writer sees it, this particular style represents a reversion to what could be called ancient Oriental forms, for rea- sons in part religious and in part technical. It seems to me quite possible that the string drapery is a misunderstood develop- ment from the Hellenistic method of representing a thin, transparent upper gar- ment by a series of ridges that still reveal the arrangement of the heavier dress be- low."" If only the system of portraying the outer robe were retained and the carving of the undergarment suppressed, we would get something like the familiar Late Antique formula of surface-carving in loops and padded "U's" that are found in Palmyra and Gandhdra. Some recollection of the original function of this ridged drap)ery seems to survive in India and Syria, in that, frequently in the depression between the padded loops, the drapery is carved into a sharp but low ridge, the crest of which parallels the direction of the enclosing string folds: in cross-section, then, the profile of the folds would be alternately round and sharp.40 It seems not unlikely that the purpose of the subsidiary ridge was to indicate the presence of a garment underneath the outer robe represented by the padded folds, but generally, like the latter convention, it seems a mere surface decoration with no real functional pur- pose whatever. Such a development as this could be said to go hand in hand with the general tendency to revert to ancient Oriental techniques-in this case, a return to the method practiced in all archaic art, indicating the drapery folds by lines incised on the surface of the body, without regard for the volume and substance of the gar- ment. In the beginning, such an abstraction was part of the tradition of non-repre- sentational art in the Orient, in which almost mathematical rhythms in line and shape were used as substitutes for, or improvements on, nature. Such schematic and ordered interpretations were at once readable and more final than imitations of the casual and accidental shapes of actuality. Schematizations like the striations, "Bagel-falte," omega-folds, and chevron patterns, forms extremely beautiful in them- selves, that we see in "archaic" periods of art, are not the result of ineptness in "naturalistic" portrayal of actuality, but are really concentrated and clarified mental images or mental creations of ideal schemes of folds which, even though they do not exactly follow any real drapery or garment, suggest what we could term a more or less universal or absolute system of folds - more final in the unity and perfec- tion of its abstract arrangement than could be achieved by the imitation of an actual model.41 The "ineptness" in such a system of representing drapery lies not in the 1" As on the Skopaic reliefs of the column drums in the temple of Artemis at Ephesus (G. Rodenwaldt, Die Kunst der Antike, Propyldien Kunstgeschichte, iii, Berlin, 1927, 433), or in a third-century draped figure from Magnesia, now in the museum of Constantinople (A. W. Lawrence, Later Greek Sculpture, New York, 1927, pl. 50), and cf. Van Ingen, pl. XV, 106, No. 208. 40 This technical parallel with Palmyra is corroborated by the fact that in numberless examples, the Gandhaira figures are wearing jewelry of a completely Palmyrene type. Cf. M. Rostovtzeff, "L'art greco-iranien," Revue des Arts Asiatiques 7, 1931-32, p. 209, n. 1; the adornments of others, especially the torques, are a continuation of the types of Graeco-Parthian jewelry found at Sirkap (Taxila). 41 Mere inadequacy and nai'vet6 is offered as an explanation for this type of drapery by G. Combaz in his L'Inde et l'Orient Classique (Paris, 1937), p. 120: "Le parallklisme et la convergence des plis sont</page><page sequence="11">GANDHARA AND LATE ANTIQUE ART 233 failure to copy nature, but rather in the relative success or failure to suggest within the limits of the self-imposed abstract formulae the essential nature- structure, or- ganization, form - of the object by the realization of the mental image in the ma- terial. The linear drapery of the Late Antique period, as exemplified by the sculp- ture of Palmyra, Seleucia, and Gandhara, surely represents not only a technical evolution from earlier classic types, but also a not unconscious return to the ab- stractions of earlier periods.42 The ineptness or crudity of this, like other phases of Late Antique art, is due to the confusion of the traditional systems of abstraction with the naturalistic tendencies inherent in classical art everywhere. There is no more likely moment for the development of this peculiarly hybrid technique to have taken place than the epoch of the Arsacids, when we may imagine the Greek style introduced by Alexander's successors was being gradually absorbed by the still vital tradition of the ancient Orient. Although the so-called loop or string drapery is already prophesied in Parthia and in the terracottas of Myrina and Seleucia, it does not attain its final develop- ment until the second century A.D. in the sculpture of Palmyra which was, we may be sure, like the whole civilization of this desert city, indebted equally to Rome and Parthia. This date fits in well with its appearance in GCandhiira images which, on other grounds, cannot be dated earlier than the first half of the third century A.D. The identity of the Palmyrene and Gandharan drapery technique seems to exclude the )possibility that the latter was developed independently: it appears on the con- trary much more likely that this drapery formula was introduced ready-made, fully evolvetd, together with other types and techniques of Late Antique art around 200 A.D. The great majority of the Gandhiara Buddhas have the sharply-cut features, the imlpassive, luminous beauty of the Palmyrene adolescents; the analogy extends to the technical device of representing the eyeball as slanting upward and outward under the lid; again, as in the Palmyra heads, the I)upil is more frequently than not incised.41 These, I need hardly point out, are mannerisms that again make their ap- pearance in the clear, hard portrait sculpture of the Constantinian period. Dr. Scherman raises the question whether the "snail shell" curls that become part of the standard iconography of later Gandhara Buddhas is an indication of Palmyrene influence "oder oh man . . . an verschiedenen Orten auf dieselbe Darstellung selbsthindig verfallen ist." 4 Although possibly the Indian traffic with Palmyra may have been responsible for a revival of this formula, the type of hair treatment in in- dividual curls was so universal in India and the ancient Orient that it cannot justly be ascribed exclusively to Palmyra. les caractbres essentiels des premiers essais de draperie chez tous les peuples." This author, like so many other authorities, fails to see the aesthetic and philosophic reasons behind such forms which made men seek to improve and organize, rather than copy nature. 42 It must, of course, be admitted that in many of the cruder examples of Late Antique carving, the methods of incision and linear stylization are just as often the result of technical incompetence as they are caused by the artist's deliberate purpose. 43 The eyes of many of the Gandhdira images are of the completely Indian "lotus-petal" shape.

Again, it seems due to something more than accident that practically every known example of the standing Buddha in Gandhara is carved in the proportion of five heads to the total height.45 This is again the norm for the standing figures in the grave stelae and memorials of Palmyra and Dura-Europos: it applies likewise to the figure sculpture of the Constantinian period in Rome.46 Originally a form of expres- sionism, the creation of figures with large heads was part of the general tendency toward spiritualization in the art of the Late Antique world; its purpose was to concentrate attention on the head as the most important part - perhaps as part of the new interest in the individual - to focus particularly on the huge, hypnotic eyes which were about the only device known to the classic world- likewise adopted from earlier Oriental sources to the Fayuim portraits-for expressing an other-worldly, ghostly feeling and one that contributes largely to the radiant quality of some of the better adolescent heads from Palmyra. The stylistic connections between Gand- hdra and Syria seem to be more than amply confirmed by the new evidence of ac- tual importations of Syrian glass discovered by M. Hackin at Begram.47 In closing, it will be appropriate to summarize the results to be derived from the comparisons made in the preceding paragraphs and to draw some general conclu- sions on the place of Gandhara in the twilight of the Hellenic world. It is apparent that the art of Gandhara was affected by waves of influences coming from the West -from Rome itself and the Eastern Roman Empire. This much is clear from the arguments advanced above. But something remains to be said about the spiritual forces-really of international character-that were active in Gandhara, as in all the territories of Rome. The changes that took place in late Roman art are attributed to the so-called "Orientalizing" tendencies already initiated in the Parthian period but temporarily arrested by the revival of Hellenism under Roman protection. In this process of disintegration the classic forms came to be conceived in a linear, frontal style that, in certain aspects, seems like a return to the archaic, or, perhaps, a survival of the archaic spirit in regions never completely dominated by Hellenic ideals; figures be- come isolated in their own atmosphere and take on an inhuman rigor; a luminous, spiritual quality animates mask-like faces with enormous eyes; the drapery is hardly more than a mesh of ornamental striations that, in accordance with the oriental tendency towards coloristic effects, is reduced to a design of sharp lights and darks. All these changes were obviously due more to change in point of view than to what is usually called "decadence." These tendencies toward loss of plasticity, disembodiment of form, linear organ- ization and the great feeling for flat color and surface decoration are, on the one hand, the result of the transformation of Hellenistic art in the hands of peoples used to thinking of art in terms of textiles or metal work. Again, these same peoples, 45 The measurement includes the usnisa. 46 See, for example, the figures in the Memesis relief from Dura-Europos (Excavations at Dura-Europos, 1928, pl. IV, 1); the figure of Aphlad likewise from Dura (Excavations at Dura-Europos, 1931-32, pl. XIII), and, for the Palmyra figures, Ingholt, op. cit., pls. 1, 2 and 3. The figures of Tetrarchs at San Marco, Venice, measure 51 heads high; the Christ in the Psamatia sarcophagus about 52. 7 J.

The resemblance in the spiritualized "immaterial" look of Palmyra reliefs and the sculpture of the Danubian provinces is to be explained by just such a parallel in religious points of view. In Gandhara and Iran, as in the Germanic colonies, the processes mentioned above were quickened by the existence of religious and racial temperaments that conceived their deities in abstract rather than representational, symbolic rather than concrete, terms. In the Christian world the opposition to naturalistic images was based partially on the Mosaic law, partially on the mistrust of the pagan gods or "'demons." Since these tendencies can be seen alike in Dura-Europos, Sofia, Trier, Gandhara, and Roman Britain, there is no ground for attributing them entirely to "Oriental" influences, but rather to the reaction to classic art by "barbarian" peoples on the Rhine, the Danube, the Indus. What may seem crudeness and ugliness in these works is due more to a change in point of view than to decadence: the preference for recording things seen and known by these various "barbarian" peoples, the attempts to express new life and action, mitigated against the continuation of the cold, perfect types of classicism.48 When these latter are attempted, they are obviously adapted to artistic formulae intui- tively known to their makers: the Palmyra reliefs are often strong and vital as spiritualized portraits - and this is true of certain G'andhra Buddhas: the classic drapery has been reduced to the "archaic" Oriental pattern: the same dualism exists in "Graeco-Buddhist" sculpture, with the living ethnic portrait heads of Hadda and the usually cold masks of the Gandhara Buddhas. That this movement was already well under way in the East in the third century is exemplified by the fragment of the draped figure from Shapur, by the reliefs on the arch of Galerius, and, most strongly of all, in the sculpture of the school that was most largely responsible for the transformation: the Syrian centres of Palmyra, Dura, and Baalbek. One may compare with these carvings, reliefs from Sofia and Skoplje, stelae from Spalato and Aquileia, that appear almost as works of the same school. 49 In a funerary statue at Este we find the same bifurcated folds that are so marked a feature of late Gandhara and early Chinese sculpture.50 In looking through the plates of publications like Ferri's admirable, but little- known works on Roman art on the Rhine and the Danube, one notices that the work is at once unified and diverse in quality: the crudeness, that is, a seeming technical incompetence, but really a persistence of the archaic or "traditional" point of view of some of the sculpture, might at first be regarded as deceptively "Mediaeval." Indeed, all of this provincial work - the best in Germany, Bulgaria, and India, to namnie but a few centres - does give a foretaste of the Mediaeval spirit; it represents a unity in which classic art, for the racial and religious reasons outlined 48 It will be recalled that, much earlier, this point of view was held by Plotinus who preferred rude life to "marble beauty " (Enneadies vi, 7, ?2). The passage from Plotinus, as noted by Hinks (Carolingian Art, London, 1935, pp. 34-35), is of supreme importance, since it seems to record the discovery of the "soul" in Christian art. 19 Cf. S. Ferri, L'Arte romana sul Danubio, Milan, 1933, figures 556-558, 39W, 394, 395. 50 Cf. S.

The same luxurious Syrian emperors who installed the Oriental gods in the temples of Rome were also responsible for the introduction of ateliers of craftsmen from the same eastern provinces. The activity of Syrian workers in Gaul and Italy is well known; I have mentioned the part they played in the development of the Gandhara school. One can, if one insists on using the terminology of Strzygowski, think of this as a struggle between Northern and Southern, Mazdaean and Dravidian tendencies: actually, it is a case of the barbaric mind of the races in the Roman Empire and the Oriental mind producing the same result within the fabric of late classic art. When these ideas of Roman Imperial art, or, better, Roman provincial art, triumphed even in Rome itself and Byzantium, the mentality of Mediaeval art was already fully evolved. It is not in the least startling to find parallels or prototypes of "Romanesque" or " Gothic" in the sculpture of Armenia and Gandhara, since the characteristics later defined by these terms in Western European art had already come into being in these artistic provinces of the Roman Empire. The resemblance between sculpture and sculptural patterns in Gandhara, Pal- myra, and Gaul must, in part, at least, be explained by trade and the rapidity of communications down the arteries of the Empire. That they were due in part to similar spiritual forces at work on the boundaries of Imperial Rome has been sug- gested. BENJAMIN ROWLAND, JR. FOGG MUSEUM OF ART</page></plain_text>
