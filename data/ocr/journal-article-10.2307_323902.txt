<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS some Slavic peoples" (p. 103) and as such "it left many traces that still persist in folklore and in folk art" (p. 103). At the same time, Citevskij's conception of analogies leads him toward a new understanding of the baroque which for him "assumes in many ways the legacy of the Renaissance" (p. 94). According to him, "The 'rebirth' of the classics continues, although the baroque interprets them differently and attempts to reconcile them with Christianity" (p. 94). The ambitious treatment of material in a limited space of some 225 pages is impressive, but makes the problem of oversimplification inescapable. The wealth of information covers the course of the last thousand years of Slavic literary development. Such an inclusive approach at times makes analysis difficult and fosters some dubious generalizations such as ". .. emanations from Russian romanticism began to spread, primarily among the Ukrain- ian, Slovakian, and Czech literatures" (p. 147). Cizevskij's work is divided into twelve sections covering various literary periods which are placed without precise chronological boundaries because no literary period really ends with the turn of another period. They are: "Introduc- tion," "The Beginnings of Slavic Literature," "The Early Middle Ages," "The Late Middle Ages," "The Russian Literature of the Muscovite Period: Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," "The Hussite Movement," "Renaissance," "Baroque," "Classicism," "Romanticism," "Realism," "Neoromanticism (Modernism)." The in- troduction is significant, for there the author outlines his method and surveys the basic nature of his work. In his conclusion, the author lists problems which he could not include in his work, but which are essential in order to make the comparative history of Slavic literatures more genuine and profound. His sixteen pages of selected bibliography are of extreme value. The author's tone of writing is cautious and modest, exemplified by phrases such as "This problem, however, can only be alluded to here" (p. 197) or "I hope that such a general work as the present one will be of value as a first step toward a synthetic study" (p. 25). His critical evaluations are admirably sound and perceptive; therefore both the general reader and the specialist will find rewards in this work, for it is a model of humanistic criticism based upon sound scholarship. 2Cievskij's many astute obser- vations on style and characterizations of various literary periods are of the greatest interest and value. The book, however, is marred by the editor's "Foreword" which is filled with historically wrong and politically biased statements about the "eastern or Russian Slavs." Also, some of the footnotes added by the editor are unnecessary and ineffective. The translation of the book, in general, is good. There are, however, too many typographical mistakes (see especially Sevcenko's poem on p. 142). But the book on the whole is a highly readable work and offers valuable insights into Slavic literatures. It is still too early to measure or evaluate its full impact on comparative studies; only time can tell how much it will contribute to the understanding of Slavic literatures. Vanderbilt University Press deserves special credit for undertaking the publication of the English translation of Comparative History of Slavic Literatures, for the volume's attractive cover, and for the general layout of the material. WOLODYMYR T. ZYLA Texas Tech University HARJAN, GEORGE. Jan Parandowski. Twayne's World Authors Series. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1971. Pp. 160. $5.50. George Harjan in his rather brief survey of the writings of Jan Parandowski (1895- ) presents one of the recognized modern masters of Classical Polish prose, whose style is held up as a model for the young, and a man of letters whose service to Polish literature and culture are far- ranging. Since 1933 Parandowski has served as the only President of the Polish P.E.N. Club and since 1962, as Vice- President of the International P.E.N., through which he has been able to offer assistance not only to Polish writers, but also to writers from Western European countries, especially in the years just before the holocaust of WW II. Paran- dowski has seen his own work widely translated into Western European languages and has reciprocated with excellent translations of numerous authors, among them, Romain Rolland, Th6ophile Gautier, and H. G. Wells, as well as with essays on Erich Maria Remarque, Anatole France, Gustave Flaubert, James Joyce, and a fictional recreation of the life of Oscar Wilde entitled King of Life (1930). In his essays and fiction Parandowski helps keep in the foreground of the Polish reading public's attention such giants of Western, European culture as Dante, Petrarch, Copernicus, Galileo, and Shakespeare, to mention but a few examples of Parandowski's cultural service to his nation. This however forms but a small sector within Paran- dowski's focus of interest. What he is probably most noted for throughout his life of teaching, criticism, and art is his continuing effort to preserve the learning and culture of Classical Greece and Rome. This is reflected in his pop- ularization of the Iliad and the Odyssey for young people, as well as in his extremely highly regarded translation in prose of the Odyssey. Also in this vein are his early Eros on Olympus (1923), a highly popular collection of short stories depicting the amorous .adventures of the gods and goddesses; Aspasia (1925), a miniature portrait of Pericles' wife; and the novel-length recreation of the Olympic games in 476 B.C., The Olympic Discus (1932). This last work is a celebration of the Olympic spirit of amateurism (already then under threat from professionalism!), and in that spirit its author was awarded a bronze medal at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin over the protests of the hosts. Parandowski's propagation of Classical culture proceeds from his deep love and knowledge of that culture and from his belief in the continuity and unity of Western European culture surviving all the tragedies of History and in Poland's integral role in that continuity and unity. Such works as Two Springs (1927), Three Signs of the Zodiac (1939), Mediterranean Hour (1949), Alchemy of the Word (1951), and even the autobiographical Sundial (1953) illustrate Parandowski's restatement of what might be called the Polish idea, namely that "Poland lies on the Mediterranean." Indeed Parandowski's creativity might prompt a larger version of that statement, i.e., that all of Europe lies on the Mediterranean. The collection of short stories Three Signs of the Zodiac may be taken as represen- tative of this central facet of Parandowski's art. These stories proceed from "Agean Civilization," a general pic- ture of Classical culture to sketches of the life and times of figures as diverse as Aristides, Ptolemy II, Cicero, Dante, Muhammed II, Copernicus, Galileo, Shakespeare, Kochanowski, Didero, Joseph Conrad, etc. In this fashion the stories demonstrate the common heritage and continui- 65</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS ty of Western European culture and civilization reaching their culmination in the Cross of Christendom in the last story of the cycle, "The Holy Father Blesses." Parandowski wrote only one novel as such, which may be taken as something of a curiosity for a man who voices such strong support for the traditional novel form, although he does admit of late to a certain impatience with the necessity of working out narrative forms for his subjects. In any case, his one novel, Heaven in Flames (1935) is outstanding. It is generally regarded as his highest achievement and certainly should be translated into English even though the early 50's with the popularity then of Salinger and of James Dean's role in "Rebel Without a Cause" probably were the most fertile ground for reception of Parandowski's rebel. Of course Parandowski's young hero rebels for a specific reason, a crisis of faith in God and the Catholic Church. Still, the resulting malaise spills over into his whole life, thus making for more similarity with a Holden Caulfield, for example. Particularly successful is Parandowski's picture of the complex, flawed, compromised, hypocritical, and out- and-out selfish responses of adults, both lay and clergy, to the challenge and honest questioning of the young hero. In this novel Parandowski presents a world in which the most honest are the least successful, where honesty is traded off for success in the bureaucracies of church and state. The only reservation I have about Professor Harjan's over-all excellent introduction to Parandowski, which is clearly a labor of love, is that he fails to bring Parandowski the man, the creative personality, across to the reader. He obviously knows well, respects deeply, and has great personal affection for Parandowski, so that this failure seems paradoxical. Parandowski is clearly a reticent man, and this reticence is seemingly compounded by Mr. Har- jan's own reserve, so that by the end of this study we do not have much of a "feel" of the man. Perhaps this is an unavoidable pitfall in writing about a living author for whom one has such deep respect and affection. The reserve here does however seem to extend overmuch to Paran- dowski's creative personality, aesthetics, and philosophy of art. Whereas we read, for example, that Parandowski was constantly preoccupied with questions about the problems of the writer and his function in society and life (p. 113), works where these questions are specifically taken up, such as Alchemy of the Word (1951) are not granted much discussion, with the result that the reader is not left in much of a position to assess Parandowski's answers to these questions. FRANK J. CORLISS, JR. Wayne State University GERBER, ADOPH. Great Russian Animal Tales. A Collection of Fifty Tales. New York: Burt Franklin, 1970. Pp. 112. $12.50. Originally published in 1891, that is, before the great comprehensive inventories of folktales had been prepared but after the appearance of Kaarle Krohn's monograph on the Wolf-Bear-Fox "folktale-chain" in Northern Europe, this book contains fifty tales abridged and translated from the German of Leskien. It will, therefore, be most read nowadays as a supplement to the relevant sections of M. Wosien's work on Russian folktales (Munich, 1969). In his introduction Gerber proposes to single out the evident parallels with medieval literary manifestations of the stories and, as an innovation in his day, to isolate in a synopsis all the instances of agglomeration of simple adventure-episodes and their transferences from tale to tale. These are the now well-known "functions" of V. Propp and "emic units" of A. Dundes, in an older guise. The introduc- tion goes on to examine questions of origins, of polygenesis and of hypothetical "original form," concluding that practically all Russian animal tales were primitively non- Russian. One may note that theories of origins are still being surveyed in our own day, especially well in K. H. Jackson's work on Welsh tales (Cardiff, 1961). A generation after Gerber, Von Sydow was to suggest that it is always the less cultured and urbanized peoples who are likely to show a preponderance of animal-tales as against other species of folktale, and that other beings-demons or folk-heroes-"convert" to animals in simpler societies when the original tale has been accepted. The leading animal-characters in Gerber's selection are Krohn's three-the Fox being always female-and the Cat, presented always as male. Quite recently Fritz Harkort [Fabula, 9 (1967)] has made speculations about the animal folktale which are in line with attempts to get away from the inventory, in the direction of a study of the psychological and cultural forces which produce the folktale and keep it in being. So it is that he presents the animal tale as the oldest of all the types, dating back to the earliest cultures of hunters and food-gatherers. Such primitives would inevitably amass information about the beasts they hunted and the predators which were their competitors for food, and only after civilized diversification did other types of wisdom exert influence on storytelling. At that point the animal folktales were progressively supplanted. For this reason they are not so much a special kind, when they are recorded in later ages, as survivals from times when the whole of storytelling implied the presenta- tion of beasts as characters. The anthropomorphism of animals in folktales has, therefore, its origin in the primitive's observation that animals and men share many potentialities and have to obey an identical law of necessity. This observation perhaps underlies the lack of didacticism to be extracted from true animal folktales, as a contrast with the sophisticated Aesopic story which has most affinities with the proverb. Usually they tell of one animal-character duping another, or perhaps misjudging his intelligence and failing to dupe him. Frequently the context is of explicitly sexual outrage. There is consequently no reinforcement of any moral code, and the teller of animal folktales merely invites the hearers to agree with him that the world is full of vanity. We may applaud those who come off best at duping their fellows as we would the winner of a riddling-contest or a field-game. Mere exposure to the trend of folktale of this comic kind will in time inculcate a kind of ethic. As an appendix to his collection Gerber provides a summary of the plot of Lisa Patrikjevna, an epic elaborated in 1882 by A. MoZarovskij from selected Fox-and-Man tales. There is additionally a useful table of cross-references with collections of tales from all over the world which were extant in 1891. ALAN SOONS Rice University 66</page></plain_text>
