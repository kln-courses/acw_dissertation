Giving life or life-like characteristics to inanimate objects is called anthropomor- phism. If we talk about "she" and refer to a ship, this is anthropomorphism. If we speak of "God" and give Him a human reference, this is anthropomorphism. Much of children's literature contains anthropomorphic reference; but if you ex- pect to find anthropomorphic articles trip- ping over each other you will be disap- pointed. The Readers Guide , Education Index and Library Literature contain little. While much written is anthropomorphic, little is written about anthropomorphism and its practice. It is clear- that anthropo- morphism is one of the vehicles we use to explain our relationship to the world and to the universe. Anthropomorphism was a commonly ac- cepted occurrence among the ancient peo- ples. A cave artist painted animals on the wall, hoping the wounded animal on the wall would become the animal killed in tomorrow's hunt. The ancient Semites wor- shipped Marduk and the Carthaginians Baal, raising stone images in their honor. Not only were these statues worshipped, but responses were expected from them. The Greeks had a change of clothes for Athena's statue. Medusa was so horrible she changed men to stone, and Midas had a golden touch that changed his daughter to gold. St. Francis of Assisi called the sun, wind and rain his brothers. Anthropomor- phism. E. L. Cherbonnier wrote in the HAR- VARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that when man seeks to explain God by using human attributes, he is practicing anthro- pomorphism; but this is acceptable if we are to love God.1 We never think of Michel- angelo's paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel as one vast anthropomor- phic paint pot. Anthropomorphism is not new; it has been practiced for thousands of years, particularly in religious areas. Hans Christian Andersen wrote fairy tales. Some of these fairy tales include anthropomorphism; for example, THE DROP OF WATER, THE FLAX, THE FIR TREE, and THE CONSTANT TIN SOLDIER. Andersen is not the only writer to do this. Oliver Wendell Holmes gave the Frigate U. S. S. Constitution a person- ality, and a large portion of the nation rallied to save the ship from demolition, thereby preserving it for future Americans. For years the poem, OLD IRONSIDES, was a great favorite of eighth grade boys.2 Perhaps it still is. 190 1 Cherbonnier, ""Logic of Biblical Anthropomor- phism", p. 203. 2 Core, FAVORITE POEMS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN, p. 259.</page><page sequence="2">Anthropomorphism in Children's Literature 191 The twentieth century has not seen an- thropomorphism die. A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh was published in 1926, and Chris- topher Robin's toys are not lifeless things. Christopher Robin easily steps into fantasy with his friend Pooh. Winnie the Pooh is still popular among children and grown- ups.3 In 1930, Anna Parrish published THE FLOATING ISLAND in which dolls talk and have all the emotions of man. In this story people are not really important, for they don't know about this secret life of the dolls. A shipwreck occurs and the dolls are cast adrift. The dolls argue and share exciting adventures. A ship is sighted and the dolls give a distress signal. The dolls are rescued from their floating island by a sailor who sees their distress signal, but finds only the lifeless dolls. In 1922, Margery Bianco published one of the many stories about her family's toys. Margery Bianco once stated that she got her ideas from, ". . . among the family toys, only we did not think of them as toys."4 THE VELVETEEN RABBIT is about a stuffed toy who wants to become real. The rocking horse tells him that if a ". . . child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with but really loves you, then you become real." 1942 saw Enys Tregathen publish THE DOLL WHO CAME ALIVE. A child whose stepmother is unkind, a "Grandmother who didn't love me", and a leg that is lame, com- bine to create a letting for fantasy. The child washes her doll, buys clothes for her doll, and loves her doll mightily. The day comes when the doll is ordered thrown away. The child cannot destroy what she loves and yet she is afraid to disobey. She and the doll leave the real world and enter the world of the "tiny folk". The year 1927 saw Margery Bianco write another anthro- pomorphic story, the SKIN HORSE, and everyone is familiar with an earlier classic by Collodi called PINOCCHIO. Why are anthropomorphic stories popu- lar? They are not reality. Toys do not talk. Toys do not love back. Can it be that these inanimate objects can do what people are not able to, or dare not do, or is Cor- nelia Meigs right when she say s, "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible."5 In the May, 1962, issue of ELEMEN- TARY ENGLISH, an article appears in which the author lists seven stories that continue to be popular, despite the authors belief they are unworthy; one of these is RAGGEDY ANN tales.6 May Hill Arbuth- not states, "Children like stories about their own toys and are very egotistical about them.7 Raggedy Anns and Andys are still popular toys. I suppose children want to escape from reality as much as adults. There is satis- faction in chastising a doll which has mis- behaved. There is comfort in holding some- thing you love without the danger of love being withheld from you. There is pleasure in being the commanding spirit, the one who understands perfectly and will not err. Tennessee Williams' GLASS MENAG- ERIE has a Laura who steps beyond the wall of reality, ". . .but for children there is no wall."8 Virginia Lee Burton has written many stories employing animated machines. These machines have names and personalities. Choo-Choo, the train, who must prove him- 3Gunderson, "A. A. Milne and Today's Seven Year Old", p. 409. 4 Ferris, ed.

Norman Bates' WHO BUILT THE HIGHWAY has road building machines bragging, "I build the highway". In Wilfred Bronson's BEETLES, a beetle's stomach is compared to a car engine, and John Lewellen in the MIGHTY ATOM com- pares the atom to Mighty Mouse.9 Other books make similar comparisons. The "ex- perts" argue long and often over whether it is good teaching to use anthropomor- phism in science. We often learn by comparing the known with the unknown; perhaps other compari- sons can be found. The Bell Telephone System in their movie, НЕМО THE MAG- NIFICENT, compares the food for our bodies with the fuel used in gasoline en- gines. All of us use anthropomorphism. In the course of a day the following have crossed my mind. "The car went around the corner on two wheels!" "The hammer hit the nail!" "The stone gave him a lump!" Ever hit back at a door that you ran into? Ever yell at your car when it wouldn't start? Ever ask something how it fell? Ever thank a telephone recording? In a folk-tale from West Africa entitled TALK a number of objects that speak are included: A yam, a stick, cloth and a brook. Men frightened by them run to the chief and tell him the story. The chief seated on his stool just outside his hut is not amused and chases them away, calling them fools, and threatening punishment if they don t stop spreading such nonsense. "Fantastic, isn't it," his stool said, "Imagine a talking yam." Bibliography 1. Arbuthnot, May Hill, Children and Books, Rey. ed., Fair Lawn, New Jersey: Scott Fores- man, 1957. 2. Cherbonnier, E.
