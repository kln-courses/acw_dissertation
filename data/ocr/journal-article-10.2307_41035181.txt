In advanced indust- rial societies, technocracy immediately suggests the growing hold of applied natural and social sciences on every sphere of life. In con- temporary literature, however, the concept appears to denote many different things--a new social group, perhaps even a new ruling group, a new style of rule, a new dominant ideology and even a new phase of social organization. An unambiguous use of the term demands some pre- liminary theoretical and conceptual clarifications . Despite their differing emphases, all contemporary conceptions tie the technocratic role to both the advance of scientific knowledge and to the ongoing transformation of governmental functions. They *This essay sums up part of the theoretical work preliminary to a research on Latin American technocrats that was to be undertaken as a part of the Politics of Modernization Project, directed by David E. Apter, now of Yale University. Although I am ultimately responsible for the development of the ideas presented here, I owe so much to the long discussions with Carlos Estevam Martins and to his comments on the first draft, that the extent of this collaboration must be under- scored. **Max Weber, "Science as a Vocation," in H. Gerth and C.W. Mills, From Max Weber, p. 152.</page><page sequence="2">2 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY also share the same modern sociological antecedent in Max Weber's central concept of rationalization. For Weber, the process of ration- alization has three principal and interconnected historical expres- sions: industrial capitalism, bureaucratic domination and modern science. Marcuse formulates their general interrelation: The specifically Western idea of reason realizes itself in a system of material and intellectual culture (economy, technology, "conduct of life," science, art) that develops to the full in industrial capitalism, and this system tends toward a specific type of domination which becomes the fate of the contemporary period: total bureaucracy.2 The legitimacy of the bureaucratic form of domination is en- tirely based on functional efficiency. Bureaucracy shows its superi- ority over other forms of social organization in its handling of large scale problems, and appears, therefore, as an institutional re- sponse to the historical concentration of various kinds of managerial functions. In the West, bureaucracy receives its most decisive im- pulse from the concentration of the means of administration in the hands of the modern nation-state and from the concentration of the means of production in industrial capitalist economies. In the poli- tical sphere, the advance of governmental bureaucracy parallels the political decline of the patrimonial elites. In the economic sphere, bureaucratization substitutes the professional manager for the capi- talist entrepreneur. Therefore, the advance of rationalization also means the emergence of new controlling elites. Further, in Weber's analysis, "Abstract reason becomes concrete in the calculable and calculated domination of nature and man. "3 Technical or functional rationality is inseparable, in Weber's treatment, from its specific historical forms: the complex of economic and political institutions characteristic of Western capitalism. The uneasy consequences of this analytical shift appear in Weber's own ambiguity toward the process of rationalization. As Karl Loewith points out, Weber saw it as an ineluctable, though inherently contradictory, phenomenon. Loewith asserts that "... every radical rationalization creates irrationali- ties with the necessity of a fate." While functional rationality remains the condition sine qua non of individual freedom and intelligent choice, it also constitutes the "iron cage" within which human conduct is determined by those very structures which it originally created. This "unintended consequence" springs from the reversal of the relationship between means and ends: As that which was originally merely a means . . .</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 3 becomes an end or an end- in- itself , actions in- tended as means become independent rather than goal-oriented, and precisely thereby lose their original "meaning" or end, i.e., their goal- oriented rationality based on man and his needs.5 The contradictory character of rationalization appears clearly in the bureaucratic structure with its inherent tendency toward secrecy and insulation from the lay public. Although bureaucracy originally em- bodied the advance of formal democratic principles against the resi- dues of feudal privilege, it contains within itself anti- democratic tendencies : . . . democracy inevitably comes into conflict with the bureaucratic tendencies which, by its fight against notable rule, democracy has produced .... The most decisive thing here ... is the leveling ojF the governed in opposition to the ruling and bureaucrat ically articulated group which, in its turn, may occupy a quite autocratic position, both in fact and in form.^ Moreover, even scientific progress and the advance of technical mas- tery over the natural and the social worlds do not mean increasing democratization. For, indeed, this vast knowledge is anything but broadly distributed: The increasing intellectualization and rationali- zation do not, therefore, indicate an increased and general knowledge of the conditions under which one lives. ^ Thus, for the average modern man, the social world becomes more rath- er than less subject to forces which to him appear to be incalculable and beyond his control. In the historical and theoretical context of Weber's analysis, technical rationality inevitably works against sub- stantive equality and substantive democracy. At the heart of the contradiction between rationality and ir- rationality in the modern world, stands the key structural aspect of control over the direction, and the unintended consequences, of the process of rationalization. As Karl Mannheim expressed it some years later, in a starker form than Weber: . . . [Industrial rationalization served to increase</page><page sequence="4">4 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY . functional rationality but ... it offered far less scope for the development of substantial rationality in the sense of the capacity for independent judg- ment .... [Functional rationalization is, in its very nature, bound to deprive the average individual of thought, insight and responsibility, and to trans- fer these capacities t£ the individuals who direct the process of rationalization. 8 [emphasis added] With the advance of rationality in all spheres of life, knowl- edge - both scientific and technical - proceeds toward further and further specialization. Technicity, and, therefore, bureaucracy as "organizational technique," are dialectically linked to the advance °f t'ie social division of labor. But technocracy, as Mannheim sug- gests, is tied to the political consequences of functional rational- ity: to paraphrase Weber, "it lives in a house of power." This power itself does not reside in superior knowledge (which, as Weber repeat- edly made clear, is specialized knowledge) but, rather, in directing the functions performed by specialists. It develops, not from scien- tific progress in itself, but from the bureaucratized structures which expropriate "the intelligence of the whole" in favor of new adminis- trative and governing elites. The concept of technocracy provided by Weber and Mannheim goes beyond the apparent equivalence between technocracy and "scientific government": technocracy is tied to the emergence of new forms of domination which are in permanent tension with democratic participa- tion. Historically, the Western process of rationalization concen- trates decision-making powers at the summit of bureaucratic organiza- tions. These bureaucratic organizations represent new forms of domination, which are submitted to the abstract requirements of func- tional rationality--calculability and technical efficiency. Theoreti- cal reason, manifested in scientific knowledge and in the progressive quantification of all aspects of experience, appears, therefore, as a necessary element in the decision-making process. Technocratic roles represent the entry of this "theoretical reason" at the decision- making centers of the apparatus of domination. We shall therefore consider "technocrats" those members of the public or "private" ad- ministrative and governing elites who, on the basis of their training, can claim scientific or technical expertise. Within a Weberian framework, moreover, technocracy is a tend- ency, and not a completely actualized phenomenon. This creates added ideological risks. Ideological legitimation is vital for a group which is still in both the process of constituting itself and in the process of acceding to power. But its ideological interpretations of itself will tend to cloud the real nature of its rise to prominence.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 5 A particularly sensitive focus, in this case, will be the relations between expertise and power. Thus, the claim to control on the basis of expertise does not exhaust the reality of the technocratic role, but expresses one of its central ideological legitimations. From these legitimations flows another central ideological element: the presentation that is made of the apparatus of power. As suggested above, the expert1 s role becomes "technocratic" only when it is inserted at high levels of responsibility in a public or private apparatus of power. Public or private "governments," be- cause of their dimensions and the scope of their functions, neces- sarily rely on bureaucratic implementation. An emphasis on bureau- cracy's very principle of legitimacy-efficiency in the management of large-scale problems - immediately implies that "technocratic" or "techno-bureaucratic" government is first, inseparable from functional rationality and second, inherent to the structural principles of arti- culation of all industrial societies. Weber's concern with the his- torical specificity of Western rationalization led him to equate rationality with its capitalistic forms. This ideological shift can be carried one step further: when the concept of technocracy is used independently from the socio-political context in which it applies, it tends to carry with it the notion of an emergent social order. Because it is totally rational, this social order is rid of conflict. Thus, what was for Weber a trend linked to a specific form of domina- tion, is made to transcend its particular historical origins. In other words, a tendency which is largely dependent upon the changing nature of the mode of production is severed from the relations of production under which it unfolds. There is no better illustration of this ideological conception than the words of an American president who was himself a "techno- cratic statesman": What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion, but the practical management of a modern economy. What we need are not labels and cliches, but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical questions involved in keeping a great economic machinery moving ahead. 9 The accent is on pure instrumental ism, on eliciting a consensus whose objective bases are already present in the society.10 The minimiza- tion of social conflict stresses, by implication, the guidance of a "neutral" or "transpolitical" state. Indeed, the implicit appeal to an univocal notion of rationality, embodied in scientific and tech- nical expertise, is inseparable from the depoliticization of social</page><page sequence="6">6 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY and economic issues. Thus, technocratic ideology legitimizes techno- cratic power by negating the political nature of the apparatus of domination in which technocracy is rooted. Theodore Roszak gives a good summation of this ideological presentation of power. He defines technocracy as: . . . that society in which those who govern justify themselves by appeal to technical experts who, in turn, justify themselves by appeal to scientific forms of knowledge. And beyond the authority of science, there is no appeal .... While daily poli- tical argument continues within and between the capitalist and collectivist societies of the world, the technocracy increases and consolidates its power in both as a transpolitical phenomenon, following the dictates of industrial efficiency, rationality, and necessity .... The technocracy is not generally perceived as a political phenomenon in advanced in- dustrial societies. It holds the place, rather, of a grand cultural imperative which is beyond question, beyond discussion.il Both the technocratic role and the technocratic ideology are rooted in structural transformations. These constitute the histori- cal matrix within which the technocratic ideology can become dominant , i.e., they provide the groups in power with a generalized basis of legitimacy. The Structural Matrix of the Technocratic Role Two major aspects can be distinguished in the theoretical back- ground of the concept of technocracy and its chief ideological conno- tations. One is structural: it includes the new forms of domination which result, directly and indirectly, from bureaucrat izat ion and from the impact of technology on the distribution of power in advanced capitalist societies. The other aspect is ideological: it concerns the new bases of legitimacy claimed for the transformed power struc- tures . In 1940, when Mannheim described the structural processes under- lying the new configurations of power and the emergence of techno- cratic roles, he enumerated three ways in which ffapart from the con- centration and centralization of capital . . . positions of social power are monopolized": the concentration of social knowledge and decision-making power above and beyond the highly specialized but nar- row competence of the technician; the concentration of political means</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 7 into the hands of state bureaucracies; and the concentration of mili- tary means in modern armies. 12 To a certain extent, the concentra- tion of the means of production and that of decision-making power in the state apparatus appear to be independent though parallel pro- cesses. What tied them together, for Mannheim, was the "principle of increasing interdependence11 in advanced industrial societies: the in- crease in the scale of organizational units widens the chain of con- sequences of a particular decision and thus increases the social costs of a mistake in decision-making. On the other hand, the devel- opment of scientific and technical knowledge increases the previsi- bility of these chains of consequences. There is a difference, how- ever, between specialized knowledge, which is a necessary auxiliary of rational decision-making, and strategic social knowledge- -knowl- edge, that is, which derives from the concentration of social power. The growth of scientific knowledge and the advance of bureau- cratization widen the distance between the public and both the sci- entific and the governing elites. To a large extent the two pro- cesses are distinct. They converge, however, when scientifically- grounded expertise enters the political decision-making process: the technocratic function in fact consists largely in making scientific and technical information available to the governing elites. This in- formation is ad hoc, relevant, that is, to particular problems. It is neither available nor readily comprehensible to the public. Nor do most political decision-makers have the necessary expertise to dir- ectly interpret these complex and specialized data. The technocratic staff not only coordinates the work of the specialists, but also "translates" it for the non-expert decision-makers: theirs is the task of preliminary interpretation. The political implications of this function will be examined later. What is relevant now is that the concentration of power transforms specialized knowledge into a factor of further power. In both private and public organizations, the decision-making process depends on the technocratic function and is structured along similar lines.13 Structurally homogeneous techno- cratic roles appear, therefore, in both the economic system and the state apparatus. Their similarity of training and, above all, their similarity of function and outlook, might create the conditions for a unification of these technocratic elites. The modern university plays a crucial role in this aspect of technocratic development. The university's role in the growth of sci- entific knowledge need not concern us here, although it is a neces- sary condition of the technocratic phenomenon. More important is the university's monopoly on scientific and technical training. The university trains the scientists and technicians who carry on basic and applied research. At the lower echelons of power, tech- nical advisers and scientific consultants feed necessary expert infor-</page><page sequence="8">8 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY mation into the public and private apparatus of decision-making. Higher up the ladder, university training provides the initial "mer- itocratic clearance'1 to the nbrain-trustersff who move in the orbit constituted by the government and its dependencies, the international organizations, the corporate sector of the economy (including the major firms of financial and legal advisers to the corporate world), the big private foundations, and increasingly, the major universi- ties themselves. I4 Informally, elite schools have always provided the bases for an "establishment" by giving their selected students access to a network of connections, confidence and allegiance which is probably more di- rectly significant for their careers than the "meritocratic" badge of the degree. But the ideological significance of the university would be limited indeed if it operated only in exclusive schools, that is, only in the direct ideological moulding of an elite group. As Gabriel Kolko has remarked for the United States: Twenty six per cent of the highest federal executives come from working class and farmer origins, and an in- creasingly larger percentage from non- Ivy League schools, and there is no evidence whatsoever to prove that social and educational origins determine policies of state. *5 Because universities monopolize, in our societies, technical and scientific knowledge, the conception of rationality which they trans- mit can appear "naturally" as universal rationality. University training and certification not only sanction the "superior knowledge" of the recipients, but also make them into "bearers of reason." In the university, however, the ant i -democratic aspects of any concen- tration of power or knowledge are legitimized by the allegedly uni- versalistic criteria of recuitment. The university provides the tech- nocratic leadership with the necessary scientific and technical sup- port, the lower-echelon specialists, who are moulded in the university by the same conception of reason that directs the technocratic outlook. These specialists are thus ideologically prepared to serve under tech- nocratic leadership, and to legitimize it as the embodiment of ration- ality. It appears, therefore, that the university plays a double ideo- logical role: as a training ground for both specialists and future technocratic elites, it gives the latter a "meritocratic" legitimacy; and as the monopolizer of technical and scientific knowledge, it re- inforces and sanctions the univocal conception of reason on which technocratic ideology is founded. Mannheim's description of the structural processes of power con- centration can now be completed: economic power or capital is concen-</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 9 trated and monopolized in the modern corporation; the means of vio- lence are concentrated and monopolized in the modern army and the modern police; the means of administration are concentrated and monop- olized in the modern bureaucracy; and scientific and technical knowl- edge is concentrated and monopolized in the modern university. Com- mand of the means of violence and the means of administration deter- mines the concentration of political power in the hands of the modern state. Finally, the ideology which develops along with these struc- tural transformations tends to legitimize them in terms of "a concen- tration of rationality11: both decision-making power and social knowl- edge appear to be concentrated in the hands of a technocratic estab- lishment, whose monopoly is thereby justified. Before examining the actual scope of the new technocratic roles, it would be useful to briefly point to the major historical develop- ment which unifies all these different processes of concentration of power, for the resulting structures are neither independent nor coun- tervailing. The passage from competitive to monopoly capitalism is marked by a shift in the prevailing philosophy of the new corporate economic rulers and, more specifically, in their conception of the role of the state. As James Weinstein points out in his study of the Progressive Era in the United States: The changes in the concept of the proper role of govern- ment and in the techniques of maintaining political and social stability reflected the end of "free11 competition and the rise of a new corporate oligarchy . . . • In fact, the increasing centralization of power and the expert management of business and social life by federal and state governments, met the needs of corporations whose scale of operations was national and international. 16 [emphasis added] The consequences of this shift became more clearly visible, and more extensive, in the restructuration of Western capitalism which fol- lowed the Depression and World War II. The need to minimize cyclical fluctuations and their social and political consequences, joined with the need to maintain capitalism's world sphere of influence, made for an increasing intervention of the state in the economy. At the same time, foreign policy and national defense became matters of major im- mediate interest to the international corporations. The rise of the defense industry and its growing importance under monopoly capitalism is but the most visible and striking illustration of the merging of "private11 and "public" interests. To analyze the relations between private economic power and the state would exceed the purpose of these</page><page sequence="10">10 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY notes. 17 In any case, it is more fruitful to focus on the fusion be- tween the two sectors of power, as does Herbert Marcuse: To the degree to which the international concentra- tion of economic power progresses, individual capi- talists are increasingly subjected to the interests of capital as a whole. Capital is ever more direct- ly and immediately fused with the state, with the government .... In other words , what we witness is that monopoly capitalism tends toward state capital- ism.18 Nationally and internationally, the rise to prominence of the technocrats is a product of these structural developments. The tend- ency toward increasing concentration of power and toward stabiliza- tion under new structures of domination is more marked in the most advanced industrial countries. In underdeveloped countries, however, technocratic roles are becoming more and more visible. Their func- tion and their effectiveness vary, depending upon each country's in- ternal configuration of power and external situation of dependence. In some Latin American countries the saliency of the technocratic function reflects the attempt to reach the internal conditions that will provide the political stability and the sizeable markets foreign capital requires. In these countries, the technocratic presence cor- responds to a new phase in their relations of dependence with the dominant world economies. The multinational corporations and the changing inter- imperialist balance are the dynamic elements of this new phase. In dependent countries, therefore, the very field of ac- tion of the state and its technocrats is limited by external factors which are not under the national government's control. Nevertheless, the technocratic conception of rationality is apparent in our Latin American illustrations. 19 In many, if not most cases, the techno- crats have been trained at the same universities as their counter- parts in the more advanced countries. More important, the structural background of their rise to prominence has the same political fea- tures: because the monopolization of social power, in Mannheim's terms, conflicts with the process of fundamental democratization, it implies : ... a decline in importance of those institutions which were based upon local representation, most obviously the decline of Congress and the increas- ing importance of the executive branch in the shaping of policy and in the initiation of legis- lation. 20</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 11 We have tied the technocratic role to the convergence of two inter- related processes: first, the growing division of labor and organiza- tion of modern industrial societies, with the correlated advance of functional rationality, that is, the increasing calculability and ef- ficiency in the determination of means with relation to definite ends, and second, the transformations in the structure of domination and in the decision-making processes in the new phase of capitalism. The emergence of technocratic power is, however, still a tend- ency and this largely accounts for the concept1 s ambiguity and ideo- logical connotations. Now, the various dimensions implied by the technocratic role need to be more closely examined. Principal among these are the relations between technocracy and technical expertise (which obviously does not exhaust the meaning of technocracy) , the particular concept of rationality attached to the role and, finally, the ambiguous relations between technocratic power and class power at the level of the state. Technocracy and Technical Expertise The notion of expertise which emerges from the preceding con- siderations involves two apparently contradictory dimensions: on the one hand, the immediate efficiency of technique is based on growing specialization; on the other hand, the type of "expertise11 called for by the new phase of rationalization is not specialized but function- ally polyvalent. The notion of expertise is concerned, that is, with "the intelligence of the whole" and is extended over the broad range of global policy planning. In her study of French engineers and administrators in techni- cal and technocratic positions, Nora Mitrani finds evidence of this divergence of specialization and polyvalence. For most of her re- spondents in positions of high responsibility, the technician is a subordinate specialist. Their view can be summarized as follows: The technician specialized in a given question is directed by the technician in, general ideas , in Lyautey's words; the former deserves the name of technician; the latter, that of technocrat.21 In a similar vein, a highly-placed Argentine planner comments: The "cold" technician, the specialist, is neces- sary. But the technician with a global vision, he is strategic. 22 Implicit in this outlook is the notion of a developing "technique of</page><page sequence="12">12 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY administration" or command. Mitrani further distinguishes the tech- nocrat from the technobureaucrat: while the technocrat is chiefly concerned with the overall administration of things and appears to hold a simplistic view of human behavior, the technobureaucrat prides himself on his "awareness of the human factor" and his knowledge of social complexities. The same Argentine planner illustrates this view: To conduct an interdisciplinary staff, requires more than scientific knowledge: it takes professional breadth, imagination, intellectual flexibility. For me, to be an architect, is not a technical training: it is a domain, from which one can look at things. I know what a structure is . I look at the world through that concept, I see its diversity, I under- stand the interdisciplinary. 23 Although the technobureaucrat would reject the term "human engineer- ing" as too obvious in its implications, his attitude is that of one skilled in the manipulation of men as things. His tendency is to transform the behavioral sciences into applied techniques which per- fect and justify his function of control. Actually, Mitrani1 s distinction is only apparently based on functional differentiation. At high levels of decision-making, the "management of things" (the construction of a new airport, the deploy- ment of a system of weapons, the development of a new line of produc- tion) involves relative priorities and implies social and political consequences; it fades naturally into the "management of men." The outlook, however, is the same: nature and society are quantifiable phenomena, and action upon them is governed by criteria of efficiency and functional rationality. Mitrani concludes: Today, the technobureaucrat is characterized by his technicity--or, rather, by claiming technicity--in the fields of economics, administrative management and behavioral sciences. 24 Even at the level of broad and complex problems, the technocratic claim to power is justified by command over knowledge. However, be- yond a certain hierarchical rank, the trend toward increasing specialization is reversed, "training consists above all in the ac- quisition of general methods of analysis. "25 It would be too simple to assume that polyvalent scientific knowledge or training, in either the behavioral sciences or in tech- niques of management, become the bases for universalistic recruitment</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 13 into technocratic positions. The clearcut case of the French elites highlights the symbolic relevance of a degree from the "right11 schools: entry into schools such as the Polytechnique or Ecole Nationale d'Administration also means entry and socialization into an elite milieu. Here, in fact, is one of the contradictions of the technocratic ideology: this ideology legitimizes power by appealing to the command of expertise, that is, to specialized knowledge which is available only to those who have undergone specialized and esoteric training, but as the expert accedes to technocratic positions, the initial con- trol over a specialized area of knowledge becomes secondary to the command of "general ideas" and "general methods." It follows that access .to technocratic roles depends on factors other than expertise. The "right contacts"- -obtained through elite schooling, party affili- ations, business connections, particularistic ties or other biographi- cal incidents --are a significant variable in the development of a technocratic career. Clearly, from Mitrani's study, the technocrat or technobureau- crat is defined in terms of functions. In the more fluid and tenuous position of the Latin American technocrats, we often found that the man builds his functions. A technocrat in Frei1 s government put it in these words: Every professional ascends to the extent to which he builds up his own job and gives it prestige. A pro- fessional must not wait to be promoted. [Of his past, he said:] It is true that I acted as a politician, but not with the aim of getting votes. What I wanted was to be able to do some day what I am doing now. In that sense, they can say that I am the most poli- tical of the technicians. 26 Training is only a footstep toward a career, and the steps of this career are only apparently linked with the initial field of speciali- zation. The broader the area of concern of the technocrat, the more his claim to expertise serves an ideological function: Every promotion to a superior rank implies a double movement: detachment from a function which is pre- cise and simple, but limited, and attachment to a more complex function, exercised over a broader field. This broader field, however, itself appears as a relatively simple element within a still broader and more complex whole. The more the tech- nical field widens, the more it becomes dependent</page><page sequence="14">14 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY upon a total social phenomenon. 2 7 As the field of responsibility widens, the purely technical as- pects of action are diluted. Certainty, characteristic of technical actions of relatively narrow scope, is progressively reduced. In areas of expanding uncertainty, the action of the technocrat tends to become political, i.e., concerned with global ends and with the so- cial power that can be mustered to realize them. A modest but re- vealing illustration is provided by the head of a technical ministry, perhaps the least "technocratic11 in attitude of all the officials we interviewed. He says: Techniques define strategies .... To make cement, we can use a damp or a dry process. The objective is to make cement, even though the dry process is more efficient. If we started from scratch, I am sure that the political decision is going to accept the solution I propose. But the problem is that we don't start from scratch, we start from ten or twenty. So the alternatives are to go back to scratch or ... to continue with the damp process ¡. In effect, forced to choose between competing technical solu- tions or to evaluate contingent side effects in terms of preferabil- ity, the technocrat must rely on the consideration of goals extrinsic to the issue at hand. He is bound to interpret the "total social phenomenon11 and thus to exceed the bounds of functional rationality. 2^ To present decisions of this scope as based on technical and scien- tific certainty is, in fact, to bolster the legitimacy of purely po- litical decisions with an appeal to functional rationality. An ex- ample is last year's controversy over the Amchitka nuclear test: The various groups who protested the test claimed, among other things, that the Administration had classified a highly critical memorandum, prepared by the chairman of the President's Council on En- vironmental Quality, Russell Train. Train's re- port warned that Ma nuclear blast like that scheduled on Amchitka could actually trigger a series of small tremors that might build up pro- gressively to a major earthquake ..." [He] warned that a tsunami , or tidal wave, might be touched off and threaten coastal towns all around the Pacific. Before the protesters obtained the re- lease of the document, tfthe AEC conceded that all</page><page sequence="15">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 15 these consequences were within the range o£ pos- sibility , but contended firmly that they were most unlikely. "30 This enormous responsibility is made possible by the centralization of power. Given the structural origins of technocratic roles, it seems inevitable that they should become increasingly independent from specialized expertise. The functions to which the technocrat is called in a "technologized" apparatus of power, staffed by special- ists, are line functions, i.e., functions of coordination and strategy-mapping. The technocratic roles are concerned with the or- ganization of technical processes and functions and with the media- tion between different elements, including the human elements, in- volved in the realization of any given project. As an examination of the high level "technical11 advisers of the modern Presidency re- veals, these men: . . . are scientific and technical entrepreneurs whose power is largely based on their ability to mobilize organized intellectual, scientific and technical manpower, and other resources ... in be- half of going institutions. They are much more like managers than like intellectuals, much more like brokers than like analysts.31 One Argentine economist, recently resigned, described how he and his team decided to pass from purely advisory functions to tech- nocratic positions: We thought that ... if we passed to positions with sufficient technical resources, we were going to be useful and capable of wielding in- fluence from these positions. Our team being so coherent, we thought that we would achieve a modern, scientific, solid orientation of the economic policies. ^ A Peruvian planner gave this insight and this implicit definition of technocracy: The planner tends to pose the problems at the level of the structure of power and he runs the risk of politicization ... that is, he ends up in technocracy. I see his function as subordi- nate to the decisions of the politician, but</page><page sequence="16">16 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY there is always the tendency of the technician to want to act a little beyond technique.33 Another described his team's intervention in the modernization of gov- ernmental bureaucracies as follows: We get a lot of criticism ... but we managed to show them that even if we do not know about con- tent , we know about organization. 34 As these comments indicate, the "politicization" or "technocratiza- tion" of the expert does not occur in a vacuum: he is placed in a hierarchy of decision-makers and is subordinate to the "purely" po- litical function. It can be argued, however, that their brokerage in scientific and technical expertise enables them to limit the range of possible choices open to the "real" decision-makers. Most of the men we interviewed insisted on this potential power although, in some cases, they were perhaps masking their dubious effectiveness: A planner presents an array of alternatives to the executive .... Now, you can present them "verti- cally" (ordered in terms of preferability) or "hori- zontally," that is, all on the same level. ^ There is an area of conversion from the technical to the political language and vice versa which is the proper sphere of the technocrat, of the tech- nical administrator .... The task of persuasion is one of the great tasks of the administrator.36 Another had this to say about his experience in the Argentine mili- tary government: We are going to be much more politicized than be- fore, that is, more concerned with influence than with demonstration .... The process of politiciza- tion of the technicians, I don't see it in terms of political parties, but in terms of men strategi- cally placed in important positions .... Our task is to fight in order to reach a unity of technical vision positive for political action. ' However, despite their alleged belief in scientific and techni- cal problem-solving, these men are pragmatists and accept the limita- tions of the power structure within which they operate. Social and</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 17 political considerations already intervene at the level of elabora- tion of alternatives. This ambiguity was clearly expressed by a key adviser to the executive: At the decision-making level, the technician has the power to act on the problems at hand. He recommends solutions within ji political context. However, sen- sitivity to the political conditioning must not reach the point where choices are made outside of a strictly rational framework.38 The same man adds, referring to his contacts with technicians of dif- ferent political persuasions: We can always agree on the key problems of national development, although we differ in relation to the values that each of us wants to respect and maintain. ... You see, analysis can go a long way, but the point o£ difference i£ the conception o£ the econo- mic system within which w£ operate. 39 Technocratic power appears, then, to be inseparable from ideology and from the ideological function performed by the technocrats. Ideology, Ideological Functions and Technocratic Unity In this view, a specific ideology can become autonomous and re- present an alternative to the dominant ideology, insofar as it is grounded in an autonomous basis of power and speaks for a specific set of concrete interests. Now, if the technocrat is defined by his formal training in a scientific discipline, one possible reference group and power base could be the community from which he holds his expertise. If this were the case, this community should exercise sole control over the members whom it "delegates11 to special technocratic functions. How- ever, the power vested in the technocratic role does not derive from the initial command over technical or scientific knowledge; insist- ence on expertise as legitimizing political decisions is, in fact, ideological. By ideology is meant, following Althusser, an imaginary account of a real Situation. 40 it would be inconsistent with this analysis, as well as with most accounts of technocratic power, to consider a scientific community or the scientific community at large as the technocrats1 autonomous "base." A more frequent hypothesis is that the technocratic elites, unified by a specific outlook, have the potential for becoming a structured and autonomous power group.</page><page sequence="18">18 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY Some authors, indeed, present the technocrats as a possible so- cial class. 41 They argue, among other things, that the technocratic elites occupy similar structural positions and have been moving to- ward an awareness of their common interests, based on a common world view. Such an interpretation is based on assumptions about the an- swers to some interlocking questions: What basis is there to presume a commonality of interests among these technocratic elites? Since world view is an important element of the argument, what are the na- ture and functions of their specific ideology? Finally, what are the determinants of the technocrats1 specific positions of power? The homogeneity or similarity of training undoubtedly repre- sents a potential basis for unification for the technocratic groups. Their training provides them with a scientific and technical language which is largely inaccessible to the non-initiated and is shared, moreover, across national boundaries. Our Latin American respond- ents, less centrally located than their counterparts in more advanced countries, were nevertheless aware of this element of commonality. To give but a few illustrations: The situation is the same everywhere: I just came back from Yugoslavia, and we reached such levels of sin- cerity with the planning technicians, that they ended up telling me all their frustrations, because even there, the politicians don't understand them. 42 Communication is quite simple and easy with young people with a technical orientation in the other poli- tical parties, provided that they are not compromised with concrete interests .... This can be explained, in the first place, by the phenomenon of a relatively systematic training with basic lines in common. You see, economic discussion doesn't have a very wide range and the different approaches are much more widely diffused than in other fields ... we translate a lot into and from Russian .... This explains in part the greater objectivity of economic analysis .43 The new technicians are characterized by the new terms they use: they invent a language, which makes them possessors of a secret .... But don't believe they are selfish opportunists: they seek power in order to im- pose the new ideas. Their training is an element of strength.44 Furthermore, the technocrats function in teams. In France,</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 19 Mitrani found that similarity of training appears to generate stronger and more specific bonds than similarity of social origins. Moreover, in the case of France, the "meritocratic" restriction of access to certain schools or degrees provides the technocracy with a mechanism of control over access to its ranks. This basis of solidarity is re- flected in the composition of technocratic teams; Mitrani indicates that the existence of "cliques" of alumni, invidiously regarded by outsiders, might provide a starting point for building more inclusive and formal ties.^5 In Latin America at the time of our study, certain postgraduate schools and research centers played a significant unifying role. The principal influence came from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) , but we found that in each country groups of like- minded experts had constituted themselves as teams, either through a research institute or through a period of common experience in public service. 46 Many respondents shared the view of an Argentine techno- crat, that the "technical" world view transcended political divisions: We must reach an understanding at the level of objec- tive reality, we must go to things, to facts, and understand each other in that way. Presently, I think that communication is often easier with individ- uals who, in terms of doctrine or ideology, are "on the other side," than with people of the same per- suasion. 47 Although the technical world view was not as transcendent in the polarized political context of Chile, even there ECLA, some research institutes and the technocratic experience of the Popular Front gov- ernment (1938-1945) seemed to have played an important formative role. Leaving aside the particular implications of the Latin American context, we can draw some general elements of analysis. The training of technocrats, and the scientific and technical language they com- mand, appear to be elements of unification. They view themselves as sharing an objective and universal rationality based on superior knowledge. Their concept of reason stands above political lines and, in certain cases, conflicts with the politicians1 criteria for decision-making. In terms of some earlier considerations, what does this concept of rationality involve? One author summarizes the previous discussion: Technocracy is the power of a stratum capable of im- posing a general conception above and beyond the point of view of the technicians. 48</page><page sequence="20">20 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY Vague as it may be, this "general conception" is oriented by the functional rationality which shapes the technical world view. The tendency to reduce all issues to problems of means, under the unques- tioned values of efficiency, growth and productivity, is the ideal - typical characteristic of the technical world view. In a simplified Promethean conception, the world appears to lend itself to total pre- dictability and, therefore, to total mastery. If uncertainties and tearing choices subsist, they will be absorbed when more adequate technology and better operational models, based on more quantified information, become available. In actuality, this vision is rein- forced by the development of logical-mathematical models for the handling of information: systems analysis, game theory, cybernetic models and the like, are often presented as the general conceptual tools and techniques which will compensate the increasing compart - mentalization of specialized scientific knowledge. 49 As the techni- cian becomes technocrat, that is, when his access to higher functions expands his field of action, "the partial character of the technical process is gradually negated: technique pretends to be a total opera- tion."5^ The qualitative discontinuities in this expanded field of action compared to the limited sphere of technical mastery are not recognized. Rather, the "total social phenomenon" is interpreted as: the maximum extension of a technical ensemble, all the data of which can be put into equations, translated in- to quantifiable information and synthetized by a cyber- netic machine. 51 The implications of this ideal-typical "technical world view" can be analyzed in terms similar to those applied by the French structural anthropologists to mythical thought.* *It is impossible to do justice here to their complex and sophisticated analyses. However, the insights they afford into the patterns of ideological thinking are compelling enough to justify a brief presentation of some central points, as presented in "Myth and History," Godelier's interpretation of Levi-Straussfs work: (1) In this rationalist view, myths are "an illusory representation of man and the world, an inaccurate explanation of the order of things," which transpose objective data from nature or society. Mythical thought thinks reality b^ analogy, and asserts relations of equival- ence between different orders of experience. (2) Arguments by an- alogy are oriented: "it is not the same thing to think Culture by analogy with Nature (as, for example, in totemic institutions or the caste system) and to think Nature by analogy with Culture," (as</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 21 Godelier notes that in industrialized societies today: analogies drawn from the domain of perception no longer constitute the essential material of the in the anthropomorphic representation or natural rorcesj . There are four possible theoretical trajectories of analogical thinking: from Nature to Culture, from Culture to Nature, from Culture to Culture, and from Nature to Nature. (3) Godelier1 s point of departure is the spontaneous division of human experience into two domains: "That which, in Nature and Society, is controlled directly by man, and that which is not. Of course, -what is controlled and what is not varies according t£ the form o£ society and the epoch o£ historical develop- ment." In primitive society, man's control over nature is very limited: "In these conditions, the domain of what man does not con- trol cannot fail to appear, to present itself spontaneously to man's consciousness as a domain of superior powers, which he must both re- present, hence explain, and conciliate, hence indirectly control." (4) In Lévi-Strauss1 s analysis, the savage mind creates "a reciproc- ity of perspectives, in which man and the world mirror each other." "Ultimately, what is sealed into this mythical reciprocity of per- spectives between man and the world is a double illusion concerning the world and concerning man, the illusion o£ si false explanation and o£ an imaginary action o£ man upon the world and upon himself." To complete this reciprocity of perspectives, mythical thought covers all the possible analogical linkages. Lévi-Strauss1 s analysis of totemism (analogy from Nature to Culture) reveals how savage thought, in order to think social life, borrows from nature the notion of species, which is given at once "as percept and concept" in thê~prim- itive experience of nature. It uses it as "an abstract operator," as a principle of classification for the data of natural or social reality. Under certain conditions, analogical thought transforms the notion of species into "a 'totemic operator', which serves as a medi- ation between nature and culture and intensifies the reciprocity of perspectives between man and the world." (5) Savage thought is "im- mediately and simultaneously analytical and synthetic, able both to totalize all the aspects of the real in mythical representations, and to move from one level of the real to another by reciprocal transformations of its analogies." Thus, "every mythology tends to constitute itself as a closed system, without beginning or end." An- alogical thought produces this mythical system by means of "a number of formal principles and operational rules, which imply the equiva- lent of an algebra." Because of this closed character, furthermore, "mythical thought appears as atemporal thought. "52</page><page sequence="22">22 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY dominant representation that man makes of nature and history. 53 With this historical difference in mind, it is possible to suggest the paths by which the extreme "technical world view" reverts to sav- age thought. The starting point is the ambiguous and partly illusory vision of total control over nature. 54 By comparison, in our times of funda- mental and rapid changes, society and culture appear far less con- trollable than nature. The need to establish and justify social domination is first expressed in an analogical linkage between Nature and Culture. What is borrowed from Nature is not an element of per- ception given by nature itself, such as the notion of species. In- stead, technocratic ideology transposes to its treatment of society the basic concepts and practical operations by which man relates to nature in industrialized societies: the mathematization of experience and the construction of rational tools. In and of themselves, these obviously do not result in mythical thinking. However, as techno- cratic ideology moves from Nature to Culture, from one level of re- ality to another, its aim is not merely representation or explana- tion, but control . The "notion of number11 plays the same role here as the "notion of species" in Levi-Straussfs analysis of mythical thought. Levi-Strauss's "notion of species" simultaneously empha- sizes unity (intra-species) and discontinuity (inter-species); the "notion of number" emphasizes serial relations between abstract and totally discrete elements. Applied indiscriminately to insufficient- ly understood aspects of society, the notion of number has two ide- ological effects: it promotes a serialized view of social life, and in its extreme forms, it conceals and negates the existing social re- lations between atomized individuals and substitutes abstract statis- tical relations; and it becomes the basis on which rational tools for social organization and domination- -namely, bureaucracies --are con- structed. At the extreme, the technocratic attempt to control social re- ality relies on analogical or mythical thinking. Theirs is an ide- ology of mastery, characteristic of elites who participate in power. As in the justification of the Amchitka blast, this ideology is used to legitimize irrational decisions by giving them an air of func- tional rationality: because scientific and technical knowledge is unevenly distributed, the technocratic elites can use their claim to expertise and, above all, their "secret knowledge" to minimize the uncertainty and the risks involved in a political decision. The Atomic Energy Commission could use its authority to justify the nuc- lear blast and minimize its danger because, first, the public had no access to the information allegedly available to the AEC and the</page><page sequence="23">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 23 President, and, second, the public at large accepts scientific authority as the ultimate guarantee of rationality. In other words, this manipulation of the public's ignorance could not work unless the public did not believe ill science as^ £ fetish. 55 Since the pub- lic has no real power to influence crucial decisions, its powerless- ness is justified by appealing to a notion of "scientific govern- ment, ff based on the "rational" use of scientific, though secret, in- formation. Legitimation of the uses of power does not end here. Despite the pretense of "scientific government," political decision-making cannot be totally reduced to an exercise in functional rationality, nor can the margins of risk be totally concealed. A different ide- ological mechanism comes into play at this point. Its ultimate aim is to deny that human will is involved in political decision-making. Crucial decisions are presented as the result of circumstances, which, when carefully and "scientifically" weighed, necessarily and by them- selves yield the answer.56 Thus, at the time of the Amchitka blast,* the press ambiguously indicated that "there was no going back," once the warhead was sealed in the shaft. What is implied is the control of human decisions by technology as an autonomous power. For the "benefit" of the masses, the technocratic ideology of mastery is reversed: there are neither real power elites nor real structures of domination, since the decision-makers too are subject to the blind dictates of technology. In a manner reminiscent of primitive anthropomorphism, this "public" version of technocratic ideology establishes an analogy from Culture to Nature by presenting human technology as a demonic "domain of superior powers." This ac- curately reflects the historical concentration of power which de- prives the masses of effective access to decision-making. Its use, however, is to conceal both the power and the responsibility of the governing elites. Finally, there is always a recourse to substantive rationality, even for technocrats : The Atomic Energy Commissioner James Schlesinger an- nounced to the press that he was taking his wife and two of his eight children to the site of the Amchitka blast.57 And whatever charisma remains in the political roles can always be mustered to invoke national honor and "sell" to the public the de- cision to escalate the war and risk worldwide confrontation. The oc- casional appeal to feelings and substantive values should not ob- scure, however, the "pure" characteristics of technocratic thought. Human values, and even human and social costs, are ruled out simply</page><page sequence="24">24 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY by treating them as "negative externalities." Furthermore, the func- tional analysis of technocratic thought--in terms of efficiency and instrumentality- -is seldom extended to examine the ultimate goals of action. Ultimate goals are taken for granted and never questioned by those who hold decision-making power. More than any other factor, this limitation of rational inquiry accounts for the inherent con- servatism of technocratic action. It also accounts for the particu- lar Mahistoricalff tone of technocratic thought. Since the ends are never questioned, they are always implicitly present in any particu- lar decision. Because they are neither analyzed nor revised, their precise historical origin is never consciously acknowledged: they be- come atemporal and mythical in Godelier!s sense. Normative change at the level of fundamental goals is eliminated. The ultimate ends of action, though always included in every present decision, are out- side history. Thus, the dominance of functional rationality neces- sarily mystifies the taken-for-granted goals of technocratic society and subtracts them from the scope of rational probing. Thus, in its "pure11 or extreme forms, the technical world view becomes mythical thought. This dominant ideology is articulated in different versions: from the point of view of the rulers, it stresses mastery; for the masses, it stresses universal submission to a "super- human11 power. In its "elite uses," all issues of substantive ration- ality are made to vanish: structural social conflicts are always ne- gated (although social tensions, understood as "resistances to change," are acknowledged); power is equated with competence or with technological superiority; hierarchies based on values are superseded by the ranking of issues by the grasp they offer to technical manipu- lation; the social world is reduced to the "maximum extension of a technical ensemble"; social progress is reduced to economic growth; and, finally, the technical world view itself becomes the very embodi- ment of neutrality and objectivity, the opposite of ideology. In the new phase of capitalism, the scale and the concentration of the means of production go together with the emergence of new structures of domination. The push towards increasing functional rationality works toward the fusion of private and public structures of power. Ultimately, the new dominant ideology tends to substitute technocratic rationality for market rationality: free-playing exper- tise and innovation appear as the counterpart of competition, as so- cially neutral a coordinating mechanism as the "invisible hand of the market" in the previous phase. Mitrani gives an apt summation of this passage from the tech- nical world view to ideology: at^ the individual level, the constitu- tion of functional rationality as a univocal and "imperialistic" in- terpretation of the world is a process which coincides with the pat- tern of the technocrat's career. She writes:</page><page sequence="25">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 25 The technocratic methodology is characterized by this double reduction of differences of structure to dif- ferences of scale, and of the notion of social total- ity to that of maximal quantity. The first of these two reductions necessarily leads to the second. Be- tween the two mediates a longer or shorter interval, marked by the genesis of the technocrat, starting from the technical specialization he acquired in the university. 58 Some Considerations oil Technocratic Power When technicians become technocrats they leave the limited sphere of objective knowledge to enter that of power. Their func- tional conception of reason then tends to become the basis for an ideological world view, and this ideology is used to legitimize anti- democratic decision-making. This function is possible because the belief in science as the ultimate guarantee of rationality is wide- spread in Western society. But, is the technocratic ideology also used to build an autonomous basis of power for the technocratic elites? At present there* are not enough elements to attempt an an- swer. Our analysis tends toward another interpretation: the techno- cratic ideology becomes dominant and is used to bolster a structure of domination in which the technocrats themselves play a crucial but subordinate role. We shall attempt, however, to clarify the condi- tions that maximize technocratic power. The need for "polyvalent expertise11 confers to the technocrats a certain potential for "unbound edness.11 Using Mannheim's term does not imply that the technocratic elites are independent from the dom- inant class interests, but that their functions of planning and co- ordination can be performed in a variety of bureaucratic organiza- tions: the overall similarity of these functions allows them to move back and forth between government agencies, international organiza- tions, the corporate sector and the universities. Despite this mobility, it is safe to assume that within each structure of power the technocratic roles will be defined in a particular way. The structure of domination as_ £ whole seeks legitimacy through its mon- opoly of functional rationality. But, because each large organiza- tion is rooted in the social structure and in different sets of par- ticular interests, technocrats in one large organization will eventu- ally conflict with other technocrats in other organizations, around the particular interests served by each structure of power. An insoluble ambiguity appears to be at the heart of the tech- nocratic role. As the organizers and managers of systems which apply the most advanced technology, the technocrats are led, by the very</page><page sequence="26">26 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY dictates of efficiency and rationality, to integrate these systems into ever more comprehensive wholes. But the technocratic roles are always connected to functionally different structures of power. This factor works against the unification and the autonomy of the techno- cratic elites. Even Alain Touraine, who defends the thesis of the technocrats as a class, does not solve this ambiguity. He writes: [The technocracy] is a dominant class insofar as it proclaims the identity of growth and social progress and identifies thereby the interest of society with that of the large organizations: however large and impersonal the latter may be, they are nevertheless the center ojf particular interests . ^ [emphasis added] André Gorz, on the assumption that the technocracy forms a caste because "it alone is specialized in the tasks of coordination and synthesis, !f argues that: Depoliticization i¿ the ideology o£ the technocracy itself. The so-called "neutrality of the State11 is the ideology which justifies the powqr and the dom- ination which the technocracy is led to claim for itself by the logic of its situation. 60 This interpretation begs the question of technocratic power. That technocratic groups are sufficiently structured to even express a co- herent drive for power, rather than a vague similarity of attitudes toward the political process, is doubtful. In France, where the technocratic groups within the government appear to be more coherent and more permanent than in other advanced industrial countries, their political attitudes cannot be discounted. French technocrats in government favor the possibility of acting without being restricted by, or held accountable to, "incompetent" parliaments, ministers or executive boards, but their impatience and frequent contempt for "professional politicians" is a measure of the frustrations they find in their work. Nevertheless, as Mitrani observes, "The technocrat appears often as an isolated individual who maintains tactical re- lations with his entourage. "61 In fact, the autonomy available to the technocrat appears to be the rather circumstantial result of the absence of defined leader- ship. At the state planning level, the limits of technocratic auton- omy are set by the general orientations of the social and economic policies; however, the technocrat also participates in the definition of these orientations. This possibility of influence varies with both the nature of the political forces present and with the definite-</page><page sequence="27">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 27 ness they bring to their goals. It is realistically assessed by a high level French technocrat; he says: The great majority of high level civil servants do not desire in the least to substitute themselves for the ministers in the definition of government policy. Their dearest wish is to see the minister with whom they work define a durable and coherent policy, with clear and precise lines; they can then devote them- selves loyally to its application. Without such a policy, one can hardly reproach them for trying to convince the government to adopt the program they consider most effective. 62 These comments point to another contradiction of the techno- cratic role. Except in the unlikely situation where the technocrats hold the balance of state power, their effectiveness depends largely upon the existence of a "strong" state. But this, in turn, means that they themselves can be tightly controlled. The "affinities" be- tween technocrats and "strong" governments can be illustrated by the attitudes toward the military government expressed by some Argentine technicians: The government can be influenced .... We don't need bargaining capacity, we need to make our position clear .... The parties, as a whole, have no weight, the decision of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces seems to me more important. 63 In this government, I see a framework for the recognition of the technician and for possibilities of technical action. The burial of the political system is equivalent to appealing to the imagina- tion and the talents of the technicians .... This government is closer to the technical groups, since the politicians' insulating fringe disappears. 64 The "strength" of the state must be understood in relation to its capacity for demobilizing the forces of opposition by ideological integration or manipulation, and its capacity for containing, by force if necessary, the social sectors which bear the main cost of government policies. In this light, the technocratic role can be, to a certain extent, independent of the level of technical sophistica- tion attained in a given society. Technobureaucratic trends were vigorous in Mussolini's Italy, Vichy France and Salazar's Portugal; they were determined by the authoritarian socio-economic reforms of</page><page sequence="28">28 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY these regimes, rather than by the place accorded scientific and tech- nical knowledge. 65 The technocratic trend is never independent from the political means for mustering support, eliciting allegiance or containing op- position. But the nature and stage of development of the political regime determine the extent to which the dominant ideology falls in the technocratic mould. The power of technocratic elites must, in any case, be evaluated in the context of the dominant power coali- tion, or, if we consider the state apparatus alone, in terms of the nature, structure and orientations of the political elite ¿ Prima facie, the unification of the ruling class and the attendant organi- zation of state power appear to be favorable conditions for the emer- gence of technocratic groups. Two sets of specifications are needed to qualify this proposition: First, there are different historical patterns of unification of the ruling class. One sector may establish its hegemony and suc- ceed in imposing its own project as the society's collective project. There may be a more or less stable, more or less tacit pact among different sectors of the ruling class which, over time, may turn in- to a division of functions among the ruling groups. A political movement may succeed in unifying, at least temporarily, large sec- tions of the ruling class. 66 in each case, the degree of consensus exhibited by the ruling groups in terms of power, priorities, goals and division of labor within their own ranks will vary. And so pre- sumably will the patterns of recruitment of the technocrats. An el- ement of universalism will always.be present, but its actual impor- tance will vary in relation to the other three typical patterns of technocratic recruitment: through personal relations stressing trust and personal loyalty, through exchange of favors, or through party solidarity. Second, the technocratic groups may gain autonomy at different levels of decision-making. For instance, a technocrat operating at a regional or sectorial level may maximize his autonomy by creating his own alliances locally, as in Brazil's SUDENE before 1966. In all cases, the limits of technocratic action are set by the dominant relations of production and by the dominant social ideology. 67 These determinants become more specific at the level of intermediate ends; from the latter, in turn, political action derives specific policies and programs. This distinction is analogous to that between ideology, principles and platform in a political party and, ideal - typically, the technician is concerned only with "platform" or, even more narrowly, with the implementation of specific programs. In practice, however, means and ends are dialectically related. During a project's passage from conceptualization to realization, considera- tions of feasibility feed back upon the project itself. And the ex-</page><page sequence="29">NOTES ON TECHNOCRACY 29 pert defines what is feasible. Therefore, if an expert is suf- ficiently trusted, or sufficiently indispensable, there always exists for him the possibility of passing from the sphere of purely func- tional rationality to the political arena where policies and inter- mediate ends are established or readjusted. But, since feasibility is always defined by the structure of political and economic power in a society, technocratic action must take this structure for granted. Should technocrats attempt to modify the political and economic power structure, they would do so in vain and at the risk of losing the trust of the political decision-makers. Therefore, tech- nocratic effectiveness entails self- censorship. The question of technocratic autonomy is resolved empirically in different historical situations, depending on the pattern and de- gree of unification of the ruling class, on the autonomy of the state, and on the particular or prevailing pattern of technocratic recruit- ment. In any case, the real extent of technocratic autonomy can best be assessed in situations where the technocrats1 position conflicts with that of the dominant power coalition or some of its sectors. The outcome depends upon the integration of the political elite, the integration of the technocrats within the political elite and, above all, upon the overall situation of power and conflict in the society. To recapitulate: due to the historical situation in which tech- nocratic roles emerge, these roles are inherently ambiguous. They can oscillate between two poles: that of the subordinate technician and that of the "politicized" technocrat. The structural limits of the technocrats1 autonomy are defined by the actual power of the dom- inant coalition, as well as by its composition, orientations, and in- ternal conflicts. The homogeneity and coherence of the technocratic groups appear as a secondary determinant of their autonomy. In this analysis, technocratic action is inseparable from the new forms of domination exercised by public and private organizations. In advanced capitalist societies, these forms of domination are in- tegrative and manipulative rather than directly coercive. The pres- ence and role of the technocrats allow the dominant ideology to de- velop along the lines of technical rationality and of scientific management of nature and society. The function of this ideology is to legitimize the profoundly ant i -democratic character of the power structure. Depoliticization of the masses is the ideological re- course of a system of domination which uses technocratic rationality and the fiction of scientific government to equate progress with the effects of its rule.</page><page sequence="30">30 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY NOTES 1. Excerpts from interviews with Latin American technocrats are used in the text to illustrate certain points. I am fully aware of the enormous differences between the role of Latin American tech- nocrats and that of their counterparts in advanced capitalist coun- tries. However, these excerpts illustrate the pervasive influence of technocratic ideology. This ideological similarity should not cloud the fact that the emergence of technocratic roles in Latin America characterizes a new phase in worldwide relations of dependence: among other things, it reflects the influence of international organiza- tions and the penetration of multinational corporations in dependent countries . Finally, no attempt is made to connect this analysis with that of technocratic power in socialist countries, and, although I am not competent to deal with these issues, I believe that some of the points proposed in this essay can be generalized. The dialectical relations between party, bureaucracy and masses undoubtedly define a very different structural context for the technocratic roles in so- cialist countries. 2.

For a brilliant analysis of the rela- tions between civilian technocrats and military government in Brazil, see F.H. Cardoso, "The Brazilian Political Model" (unpublished manu- script); and F.H. Cardoso and Enzo Faletto, Desarrollo y Dependencia en America Latina (Mexico: Siglo XXI, 1969). The second book proposes a framework of analysis for all the governments of Latin America, tak- ing into account internal class dynamics and external relations of dependence . 20.

Olivier Kurchid, who has been interested in the peculiar movement, "Technocracy, Inc.," con- firms Mitrani 's analysis. The group, formed mainly by engineers and economists in the United States in the mid-1950s, had drawn a map of the resources of the North and South American continents; on it they based their plans for "technocratic" governance of all the societies included therein. After this article was written, Mr. Kurchid called to my attention a study of this movement by Henry Eisner, Jr, , The Technocrats (Syracuse University Press, 1967).

Although objections can be raised to the over- rationalistic view of myth adopted by Claude Levi-Strauss and his school, their in- sights into "savage thought11 are essential for a serious treatment of ideology. Also, for an example of Levi-Strauss f s extremely com- plex analysis of the relations between classificatory systems and history, see his Savage Thought (London, 1966), chapter 8. The quota- tion from Levi-Strauss is from Savage Thought, p. 222. Maurice Godelier's "Myth and History11 appeared in the New Left Review (London, 69, September-October, 1971, 93-112). 53. Godelier, O£. cit. , p. 125. 54. This control is illusory, insofar as the unintended con- sequences of our intervention with nature upset ecological balances and result in the destruction of natural resources and human health. 55. As remarked by Francois Perroux, economic thought in the early phases of nineteenth century industrialisation reduced economy to the realm of nature. This reduction constituted "zones of ignor- ance" or of "social secrecy" which, to be sure, were unequally dis- tributed among the social classes. An ideological implication of this economic vision was that men are governed by uncontrollable laws of nature and that it would be useless or harmful to reduce their ignorance. Mutatis mutandi, technology constitutes today even more unequally distributed "zones of social ignorance." The ideological argument is, once again, that economic life (and even political and social life) have meanings that are clear only to certain people-- those who control knowledge and power. For those who are excluded from the "secret," they have either no meaning at all or a different meaning than that recognized by the elites. See Francois Perroux, "Progris Economique et Signification," Cahiers de l'Institut de Sciences Economiques Appliquées (I.S.E.A.), n. 119, November, 1961. 56. Richard Nixon's speech of May 7, 1972, implied the rational use of secret knowledge: blockading the Democratic Republic of Viet- nam was "the only alternative," meaning that other alternatives had been rationally explored and considered. The collapse of the South Vietnamese army was presented, furthermore, as the result of superior technology, without reference to differences in leadership, organiza- tion or morale between North and South Vietnam. Military adventurism was placed, therefore, in a "rational" light: the war being a tech- nological affair, it would end if the enemy's access to technological means was denied. Needless to say, the implied functional rational- ity did not extend to an examination of the blockade's effectiveness. The ideological functions of this "mythical technocratic thought" can be traced in the widespread use of Orwell ian language on the part of political leaders: a "rational" and "logical" form is used to con-</page><page sequence="34">34 BERKELEY JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY vey an absurd and irrational content. The Vietnam war, in particular, has been presented to the American public in this form. One foremost example is the deceitful reference to the Geneva agreements and to the Mtwo Vietnams." There is more involved than outright lying. For a fascinating account of the making of war policy under Johnson, see Townsend Hoopes, The Limits of Intervention (New York: David McKay, 1969). 57.

Illustrations of these cases would be, respectively: the hegemonic domination of the Buenos Aires bourgeoisie in the period of Argentina's outward oriented expansion; Brazil's "confederation of oligarchies" in the same phase (see Cardoso and Faletto, O£. cit. , p. 59 f f .) ; the division of functions which, according to certain historians, took place in England after 1832 between the industrial bourgeoisie and the gentry, who were skilled in the affairs of govern- ment and still politically predominant; the last would appear to be the case at the beginning of various Bonapartist movements - a recent example is that of De Gaulle's UNR. For an interesting and thought- provoking analysis of economic relations between different sectors in the United States, see James O'Connor, op. cit. 67. The argument is that the ideology, in its broad sense, be- comes "technocratic" and, conversely, that the technocratic ideology becomes dominant, not because the technocrats as a class have seized power, but because the same social conditions generate the need for their role and the need for the ideology.</page></plain_text>
