<plain_text><page sequence="1">Defense of a Dialogue: Michel Butor's Passing Time Laura R. Kubinyi In Agatha Christie's detective novel Cards on the Table, a murder occurs at a bridge party; the host is stabbed to death with a poisoned dagger. Sergeant Battle of Scotland Yard is called in immediately to question the suspects (guests). All the guests, with the exception of a Mrs. Oliver - a famous detective story writer - are kept in the smoking room by a constable and then brought into the living room one by one to be questioned about the events of the evening. Mrs. Oliver, having great interest in real-life crime, is allowed to remain with Sergeant Battle to watch the proceedings. When Battle asks to question one Dr. Roberts first, the following conversation takes place: "I should have kept him to the end," said Mrs. Oliver. "In a book I mean," she added apologetically. "Real life's a bit different," said Battle. "''I know," said Mrs. Oliver. "Badly constructed."'1 In a novel written by Mrs. Oliver, we are assured of getting geographical realism (the setting will be London, for instance, or Bath); mental comfort 885</page><page sequence="2">(all the events will be linked by cause and effect); moral vindication (the real criminal will be caught and punished); and aesthetic balance (there will be a beginning, middle, and end). Mrs. Oliver, even if she has some doubts about how well real life is constructed, will assure us in her novels that man has his world well under control and that the world is a meaningful, intelligible, manipulable place. Her view of the world is comforting. It is against the middle-class ethos and the positivist aesthetics of a traditional writer such as Mrs. Oliver that the modern writer and the postmodern writer have reacted. A postmodern novel which is particularly interesting to look at in this context is Michel Butor's Passing Time because it meets the classical detective novel on its own ground while undercutting it and because Butor is so often called a Modernist rather than a Postmodernist as a result of his use of cultural tradition (for example, the use of the myths of Theseus and Cain in Passing Time). There is, it is generally agreed, a distinction to be made between Modernism and Postmodernism, yet the particular terms of that distinction are hard to formulate because Postmodernism is not so much a rejection of Modernism as a continuation of it with certain important differences. In "Whodunit and Other Questions: Metaphysical Detective Stories in Post-War Fiction," Michael Holquist seeks to prove that "what the structural and philosophical presuppositions of myth and depth psychology were to Modernism (Mann, Joyce, Woolf, etc.), the detective story is to Post-modernism (Robbe-Grillet, Borges, Nabokov, etc.).'"2 Holquist finds that in opposition to Modernism, Postmodernism is anti-psychological, anti-mythical, and anti-universal. It concerns itself not with people but with things (Holquist, 148). Holquist's definitions are interesting neither because he is totally right in his delineations nor because he is totally wrongheaded in making the distinctions he does. Rather his definitions point up the confusion which ensues when we try to generalize about the two movements: we wonder about the anti-psychological nature of Sarraute's The Planetarium as opposed to the psychological nature of Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway; we wonder about the anti-mythical nature of Robbe-Grillet's The Erasers as opposed to the mythical nature of Joyce's Ulysses; we question the anti-universal nature of Butor's Passing Time as opposed to the universal nature of Eliot's The Waste Land. Holquist's delineations do have some validity, but tagging Modernism psychological and mythological, tagging Postmodernism anti-psychological and anti-mythical, is perhaps too facile a distinction. In "The Detective and the Boundary: Some Notes on the Postmodern Literary Imagination," William V. Spanos states that although both Modernism and Postmodernism are anti-Aristotelian, Modernism sees man as the center of a chaotic world while Postmodernism rejects "the anthropomorphic objectification of a world in which God is dead or has withdrawn."3 The Modernists created spatialized works in which they substituted furcht, perhaps the loss of an origin, for angst, perhaps the 886</page><page sequence="3">non-existence of an origin (Spanos, 148-50).4 Although I think this distinction is a valid one, it leads Spanos to the idea that certain so-called postmodern works which have a spatialized form are actually extensions of early iconic Modernism (Passing Time, I believe, is assumed to be in this category) and jeopardize the postmodern project, which is "to engage in an ontological dialogue with the world in behalf of the recovery of the authentic historicity of modern man" (Spanos, 165-66). In short, authors such as Butor are charged guilty of Sartrian "bad faith." I would agree that the spatialized form of a novel such as Passing Time puts the novel in tension with the concept of history, yet this use of spatial form - quite different from that of the Modernists - tends to leave man "in situation" and to give full recognition to the existence of angst as a positive aspect of reality. Like Eliot's The Waste Land, Butor's Passing Time is a literary collage which incorporates fragments from mythological narratives. The essential difference between the use of collage form in these two works, however, is that where Eliot tends to focus the elements of his collage (it is man-centered and regrets the loss of tradition), Butor leaves his collage centerless (it acknowledges the freeplay of its elements).5 Perhaps the clearest explanation of the difference which occurs when a spatialized form becomes centerless is to be found in Jorge Luis Borges' views on the labyrinth as he expressed them to L.S. Dembo during an interview in 1970: Dembo: Has the minotaur ever come out of the labyrinth? Borges: Well, I have written two sonnets; in the first, a man is supposed to be making his way through the dusty and stony corridors, and he hears a distant bellowing in the night. And then he makes out footprints in the sand and he knows that they belong to the minotaur, that the minotaur is after him, and, in a sense, he, too, is after the minotaur. The minotaur, of course, wants to devour him, and since his only aim in life is to go on wandering and wandering, he also longs for the moment. In the second sonnet, I had a still more gruesome idea - the idea that there was no minotaur - that the man would go on endlessly wandering. That may have been suggested by a phrase in one of Chesterton's Father Brown books. Chesterton said, "What a man is really afraid of is a maze without a center." I suppose he was thinking of a godless universe, but I was thinking of the labyrinth without the minotaur. I mean, if anything is terrible, it is terrible because it is meaningless. Dembo: Yes, that is what I was driving at.... 887</page><page sequence="4">Borges: ... because the minotaur justifies the labyrinth; at least one thinks of it as being the right kind of inhabitant for that kind of building. Dembo: If the minotaur is in the labyrinth, the labyrinth makes sense. Borges: Yes, if there's no minotaur, then the whole thing is incredible. You have a monstrous building built around a monster, and that in a sense is logical. But if there is no monster then the whole thing is senseless, and that would be the case for the universe, for all we know.6 Passing Time, a postmodern anti-detective story, takes place in a labyrinth (Bleston) where the minotaur is missing; where we are dealing not with furcht (the hero Revel's mistaken assumption) but with angst (Butor's theme). In this situation no final solution can be given, only successive hypotheses can be made. Man is not the center of this structure, nor does the labyrinth itself have a center. Rather, man continues to relate to the elements of the labyrinth as he wanders through it, and each change of perspective modifies or negates the previous perspective. The action of detecting continues, but the possibility of final solution is gone. In this case, angst is given its full value. Butor's work has been labelled modern rather than postmodern not only by Spanos but by some of the writers associated with the Nouveau Roman as well, specifically Robbe-Grillet, Jean Ricardou, and Claude Ollier. The rift between Butor and these writers became manifest at the colloquy Nouveau Roman: hier, aujourd'hui held at Cerisy-la-Salle in July 1971. Butor's works were discussed at this colloquy, and Butor did contribute an essay to it although he did not attend the meeting. In a discussion of Butor's work, Robbe-Grillet, who has become more and more the "voice" of the new novel since the early sixties, noted that although Butor's works could be discussed in almost the same critical terms as the work of other new novelists, they were actually the opposite of those works. And he also mentioned that "since 1960, and more and more as we advance in research into modernity, we notice the rupture [between Butor and the aforementioned novelists] of which we were more or less aware from the beginning."7 From the perspective of Robbe-Grillet, Ricardou, and Oilier, Butor's work appears to be anthropocentric and appears to be in search of an origin or tradition rather than to be forging ahead into new territory. Ricardou finds that Butor's work "does not challenge in any way the cultural domain" (Nouveau Roman, 281), and Oilier finds that the texture of Butor's prose is disappointing because it "lacks vigor, brutality, aggressiveness and eroticism" (Nouveau Roman, 283). Robbe-Grillet then brings to the fore the essential complaint he has about Butor's works: "There is always this 888</page><page sequence="5">notion of a superior truth which judges and dominates," (Nouveau Roman, 284). It is in the light of this criticism, and severe criticism it is, that I wish to examine Passing Time. It seems to me that these new novelists are correct in singling out in Butor's writing the use of cultural associations and the texture of his prose as different from their own, but they misinterpret Butor's theory of the novel and his philosophy on the one hand and ignore the innovations of his writing on the other. Butor's Passing Time contains two detective stories: George Burton's traditional narrative, The Bleston Murder, and Jacques Revel's journal, which is actually a parody of the traditional detective story - in short, an anti-detective story. What is of central importance in this novel is the dialogue which is carried on between the traditional detective narrative and its parody. The structure of this dialogue is reflected over and over again in the objects and artworks that Butor has used as a mise en abyme8 in his novel. The map of Bleston, the myth of Theseus, the myth of Cain, and even the prose style of the novel reflect this dialogue between a traditional narrative form and a non-centered postmodern form. And in all cases, it is the postmodern form which is given validity as a method of researching reality. In early criticism of Passing Time, and even in some cases in more recent criticism of the novel, the dialogue between Revel and Burton was misunderstood. Revel was seen merely as a detective manque, as the man guilty of the near death of Burton, as the man who is vanquished by the dull, grimy industrial city of Bleston. In contrast Burton, because his name is a near anagram of Butor and because he theorizes convincingly about the structure of the detective novel, is seen as the successful detective and novelist. In this light Revel appears to be a neurotic who is increasingly burdened by his journal, and increasingly more confused, so that at the end of the novel he must beat a hasty retreat from Bleston, leaving the way he arrived. This view of the relationship between Burton and Revel leads to the conclusion that Passing Time itself is a failed novel which Butor has had to truncate artificially in order to salvage it from total chaos.9 This point of view, however, distorts the dialogue which is being carried on between the novelistic form associated with Burton and that form which comes to be demonstrated by Revel. Although Butor is interested in the form of the traditional detective novel, he is not trying to create a novel which would fit into that genre; he has stated: We can define the detective story by a certain number of rules.... We can be interested in the detective story and create something different. Creating something different would be to break a certain number of these rules .... But we know that if we twist these rules sufficiently, we are no longer creating detective stories. We are creating something else - for example, a new novel.10 889</page><page sequence="6">That Revel's journal and Burton's The Bleston Murder are not echoes or parallels of one another is clear in this context: the traditional detective story is subsumed by, while it remains part of, Revel's journal, which is Passing Time. Thus, it becomes clear that the key to the novel is the dialogue which is carried on between the traditional detective story and its parody in the form of Revel's journal. If we have any doubts about the care and intent on Butor's part involved in his use of the structure and conventions associated with the detective genre, we have only to look at his theory about form in the novel as expressed in "Intervention ' Royaumont" (1958), which followed the publication of Passing Time (1957): If it is true that there exists an intimate liaison between content and form, as we were told in our schools, I believe it is good to insist upon the fact that in his thoughts on form, the novelist finds a privileged means of attack, a means to force reality to reveal itself, to conduct its own activity .... We are obliged to think carefully about what we are doing, thus to make consciously of our novel, under pain of willed stupidity and degradation, an instrument of newness and, conse- quently, of liberation.11 The novel for Butor is a tool of research; the area of research is reality as it is experienced by contemporary man. On the most general level, we find that Revel's journal distorts the rules of the detective genre to the point that his journal is a total failure as a detective story - or rather is a very different type of investigation of reality. Burton's novel, The Bleston Murder, follows the codified rules of the genre: it has a detective (Barnaby Morton); an initial crime (the murder of Johnny Winn); an investigation conducted via rational, analytic thought; a solution (Bernard Winn is caught); and a final restoration of order. Revel, who reads Burton's novel and records all Burton's theories about the structure of the detective story, fails to create a codified narrative: he has a detective (himself), but he is also the criminal; he has an initial crime (the symbolic burning of the map of Bleston), but we don't discover what the crime is until a considerable amount of detecting has already taken place and other crimes - those of Cain, Theseus, Bernard Winn, as well as the circumstances surrounding Burton's accident - have diverted our attention and confused us; he conducts an investigation, but it is carried on via associative, intuitive thought; and he discovers an order at the end of his journal, but that order is only provisional. Burton's detective structure has a beginning-middle-end pattern which orders and clarifies the reality presented in the novel so that all the gaps in reality, and our understanding of it, are filled. We know 890</page><page sequence="7">"what happened." We know "whodunit." The criminal is captured. Order is restored. Once again we are dealing with Mrs. Oliver's "well-made" reality. And in comparison to this version of reality, the reality we find in Revel's journal is "badly constructed." In Revel's journal, as in our own experience of reality, we are aware, and uncomfortably so, that we do not know exactly "what happened" and much less why. In an interview conducted by Georges Charbonnier, Butor explained the major questions which apply to Revel: "Is this person going to be able to understand what is happening around him or not? If he is able to understand, all right, he is saved and he would be able to leave; if he is not able to understand he will be crushed."12 The task which Butor sets for Revel is the same task he sets for the new novelist: "The novel is thus a prodigious means of staying on our feet, of continuing to live intelligently inside an almost raging world which assails us from every side."113 When we ask what Revel discovers at the end of his journal and when we ask what Butor has achieved in creating the dialogue between Burton's structured narrative theories and Revel's ever more complex and confused journal, we find ourselves on the very ground on which Robbe-Grillet based his criticism of Butor's project. Is Revel looking for an underlying truth, an origin upon which he can structure his experience? He is, and he fails to find a structure which will fit: Burton's theories fail to order Revel's experience of reality, and, in exactly the same way, the traditional narratives of Theseus and Cain fail to work as archetypes for Revel's experience. Yet, at the end of his journal, Revel has discovered a way to survive; he is not crushed. Is Michel Butor looking for an origin? Is he collecting bits and pieces of the past, weaving them into mellifluous prose, constructing an incantation? I think we must see his project as something entirely different, and it is in this difference that we discover his innovation as a postmodern novelist. Tradition in Passing Time is constantly being mediated by "passing time." This use of tradition indicates neither acceptance of an archetypal origin nor regret at the loss of the origin. The whole of the novelistic structure attests to the fact that no origin or center exists. Butor does not reject tradition as do Robbe-Grillet, Ricardou, and Ollier; nor does he accept tradition as do Pound and Eliot. The truth which Revel discovers at the end of his journal is not a "thing found" but rather a "way of exploring." In Passing Time the dialogue of the detective stories, and within them the myths, and within them the prose style itself - all demonstrate that Butor's project is to discover an act, a function or process that is, not a center or an origin. Earlier in this essay I defined the postmodern project as the creation of literary collages which no longer had a center or a focus: Borges' labyrinth in which the minotaur no longer roamed and in which angst was allowed its full value. If one of the clearest novelistic expressions of this postmodern labyrinth is Passing Time, perhaps the clearest critical analysis of it is found in Jacques Derrida's essay "Structure, Sign and Play 891</page><page sequence="8">in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." Derrida first explains the type of structure which we have associated with the Modernists: The concept of a centered structure is in fact the concept of a freeplay based on a fundamental ground, a freeplay which is constituted upon a fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which is itself beyond the reach of the freeplay. With this certitude anxiety can be mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were from the very beginning at stake in the game. From the basis of what we therefore call the center (and which, because it can be either inside or outside, is as readily called the origin as the end, as readily arche as telos), the repetitions, the substitutions, the transformations, and the permutations are always taken from a history of meaning [sens] - that is, a history, a period - whose origins may always be revealed or whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence.14 The existence of a center is taken for granted in the positivistic narrative of the traditional detective novel. The loss of this center (which still assumes that a center does or did exist) is assumed in modern works. This structure is clearly the one we find in Eliot's Four Quartets; it is also the underlying assumption of Pound's attempt to found a paradise in the Cantos. It is not, however, the structure found in Passing Time. Butor's novel is a centerless, or more explicitly a non-centered, work. In it we see that the existence of a "center" has come to be recognized as a function rather than a thing, a fixed locus. The notion of a "non-center" is distinctly postmodern according to Derrida: This moment was that in which language invaded the universal problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything became discourse . . . that is to say, when everything became a system where the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of differences. The absence of the transcendental signifieds extends the domain and the interplay of signification ad infinitum. (Derrida, 249) Thus a non-centered structure like that of Passing Time is on-going, and it is this open quality that has led to the charge that Passing Time is not a finished work but rather a truncated one: that it is artificially cut off after 892</page><page sequence="9">Revel's stay of one year in Bleston; that it is not well-made. Yet what Butor has done is to delineate within this closed structure - one year in time; the area of Bleston in space - another form of non-centered structure which shows us that "nontotalization" (the infinitude of possible relationships) is not simply a matter of ever-extending boundaries but is also a matter of infinite freeplay within a closed space: If totalization no longer has any meaning, it is not because the infinity of a field cannot be covered by a finite glance or a finite discourse, but because the nature of the field . . . excludes totalization. This field is in fact that of freeplay, that is to say, a field of infinite substitutions in the closure of a finite ensemble. This field permits these infinite substitutions only because it is finite . .. that is to say, because instead of being an inexhaustible field, as in the classical hypothesis, instead of being too large, there is something missing from it: a center which arrests and founds the freeplay of substitutions. (Derrida, 260) In the classical detective story, the center justifies the concept of linear time according to which events are linked by means of cause and effect. This concept gives the act of detecting a base in certitude: we expect the detective to solve the crime by creating the cause and effect concatenation of clues. In Passing Time Revel, as opposed to Burton, finally discovers that the concept of linear time as we see it in the detective narrative is a factitious one. He discovers that freeplay is the structure of reality. In Passing Time Burton explains to Revel that "in detective fiction the story goes against the stream, or more exactly . . . it superimposes two temporal sequences, the days of the inquiry which start at the crime, and the days of the drama which lead up to it . . .-15 Yet, even in the most codified detective stories - those of Conan Doyle, for example - we also have a third temporal series: the days in which Dr. Watson records the story of the crime. This third series (and other possible series), if it begins to modify the events of the first two narrative levels, will undermine the linear time of the usual detective story double narrative. Revel begins his journal the day after the crime (the symbolic burning of Bleston). In the first chapter, we are dealing with the chronological events leading up to the crime. In the second chapter, the events of the present (the inquiry) are superimposed on those of the past, the drama of the crime. By the third chapter, Revel is examining the two superimposed, parallel time series mentioned above but has added to this an inverse temporal series moving toward the past and beginning at the time he started his journal. Revel begins to reinterpret in chronological fashion what he has already written by the fourth chapter, and by the last 893</page><page sequence="10">chapter he begins to reinterpret his journal but in inverse order. Butor explains that Passing Time is composed like a musical canon in which five voices are superimposed: Thus, in the fifth section of the book we will have five voices which go together. A first voice: memories, a second voice: the journal, a third voice: memories in the inverse sense, a fourth voice: repetition of what has already been told but in a different light and in normal order, and a fifth voice: repetition of what has already been told but in the inverse order.16 This musical architecture is closed because the voice of the journal will end at the end of the year, and the other two sets of voices will converge, though on different dates. This architecture is infinitely open, however, not only because there is a gap left in the two sets of voices which are in the process of converging (for example, the months January and February are barely mentioned in the novel), but also because the meaning of the events recounted is infinite since meaning arises from the particular juxtaposition of voices and events which we are given, and this process of juxtaposition is infinite, is freeplay. By putting the freeplay of Revel's journal in dialogue with the codified detective narrative of Burton - and the detective genre is one popular genre in which chronology is of the essence - Butor underlines the contrast between reality as it is presented in the positivist detective novel and reality as a non-centered field of exploration as we see it in Revel's journal. In his essay "Research on the Technique of the Novel," Butor states that the novel is the best tool for us to use in studying how reality appears - or might appear - to us. New forms of the novel are necessary: "Exploration of the different forms of the novel reveals what is contingent in the form we are used to, unmasks it, releases us from it, allows us to rediscover beyond this fixed narrative everything it camouflages or passes over in silence: the fundamental narrative in which our whole life is steeped."1 7 The structures and conventions of the classical detective genre are employed by Revel, undercut and unmasked. They are slowly replaced by the experimental form of Revel's journal. Most of Burton's theories about the detective story are undercut in this way. For example, Burton explains the architecture of the detective story to Revel in the following way: "the final aspect is only revealed after, and through, a number of other aspects, so that the narrative is not merely the projection on a flat surface of a series of events, it rebuilds these, as it were, spatially, since they appear differently according to the position occupied by the detective or narrator" (Butor, 168). When reading a traditional detective novel, we are aware of this architecture, of this progressive modification of the characters and events, and of our progressive understanding of them. 894</page><page sequence="11">Yet in this sort of narrative, we are always given a final version which tends to collapse and to deny the validity of the relations we had understood earlier. Only one version of the truth is valid; only one configuration of the clues is in clear focus when we have the final, complete pattern in our hands. And in fact, since we are working within a centered structure - a structure based on the certitude of cause and effect relationships which predicates a true version of the narrative - we are curious about the "solution" to the "problem" - not about how the problem is structured, how it is recounted. In Passing Time, which is a non-centered structure, Revel finds that his journal, while paralleling the architecture of the detective novel at first, refuses to resolve itself into a coherent whole: The rope of words that uncoils down through the sheaf of papers and connects me directly with that moment on the first of May when I began to braid it, that rope of words is like Ariadne's thread, because I am in a labyrinth, because I am writing in order to find my way about in it, all these lines being the marks with which I blaze the trail: the labyrinth of my days in Bleston, incomparably more bewildering than that of the Cretan palace, since it grows and alters even while I explore it. (Butor, 195) It is clear that at this point in the novel Revel is still unaware that he is caught in a non-centered labyrinth, an area of freeplay. The rope he is weaving will become a network of phrases rather than a linear narrative which will lead him out of the labyrinth to a final, true version of events. As readers, we become aware that what is important for Revel is not a "solution," a thing, but rather a recognition of the process he is going through in his journal: the way in which the journal is constructed. For Revel, when one series of events is clear in a specific context, other parts of his experience become vague and cloudy. He cannot be sure at any one moment that he has amassed all the relevant clues. He constantly forgets to mention important events in their chronological context because they do not begin to mean anything until they are repeated, echoed, or paralleled by later events. Revel realizes that he is discovering a function, not a factual answer, by the end of his journal. He describes this non-centered freeplay as a harmonics of time, a process of resonances in which various versions of his experiences are superimposed. Unlike the architecture of the detective story, this architecture remains in suspension because it is never completed: Thus the sequence of former days is only restored to us through a whole host of other days, constantly changing, 895</page><page sequence="12">and every event calls up an echo from other, earlier events which caused it or explain it, or correspond to it, every monument, every object, every image sending us back to other periods which we must reawaken in order to recover the lost secret of their power for good or evil, other periods both remote and forgotten, whose density and distance are to be measured not by weeks or months but by centuries, standing out against the dark blurred background of our whole history . . . (Butor, 305) It is this passage of Passing Time which best demonstrates Butor's use of the past, tradition, history. Unlike Pound or Eliot, he is not searching for an origin which explains and gives meaning to the structure. Revel does not find an origin but rather discovers a structure based on the interplay of past and present. History no longer simply explains the present via cause and effect linking as in the detective novel. Rather, some fragments of history emerge from the body of the past in the context of present events. These fragments may help to explain the present, or they may simply correspond to the present. More interestingly, the present may reawaken and reinform the past: chronology is inverted; an effect may modify a cause. In most cases, this resonance destroys linear chronology; it also leaves man radically "in situation." We see here that Butor does not reject tradition in the way that Robbe-Grillet, Ricardou, and Oilier claim to. What we are dealing with specifically in this novel is the use of the past (l'emploi du temps). In the terminology of Derrida or Levi-Strauss, Butor is a bricoleur: someone who uses "the means at hand," that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary, or to try several of them at once, even if their form and their origin are heterogenous. .. If one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one's concepts from the text of heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is bricoleur. (Derrida, 255) Thus any writer - Butor, Robbe-Grillet, Ricardou, Oilier - is abricoleur because he is forced to use a pre-existent language. All of these writers use the past; complete rupture is an impossibility. The criticism of Butor's use of the past (his lack of aggression, rupture) is perhaps based on a misunderstanding of his project, on the mistaken notion that he is searching for an origin. 896</page><page sequence="13">If we look at the way in which Butor uses some of the major signs or symbols of the novel, we see that they are employed as a direct mise en abyme of the dialogue between the detective structure and the harmonic structure of Revel's journal. The three major symbols of the novel which show the mise en abyme effect most clearly are the map of Bleston; the tapestries, which record the legend of Theseus; and the Murderer's Window, which records the legend of Cain. The simplest demonstration of the mise en abyme is the map because it is not burdened with historical or literary associations. The map is a flat plane on which all possible trajectories or routes are clearly marked. Like the detective narrative, once the final version has been given (once we decide where we are going), a map clearly sets out the relations, the directions, of the various routes. Yet Revel finds out that the moment this space becomes "lived-in" space, an architecture is created which has little relation to the flat map. As Butor points out in "The Space of the Novel": "Space, as we experience it, is not at all Euclidian space whose parts are mutually exclusive. Every site is the focal point of a horizon of other sites, the point of origin of a series of possible routes passing through other more or less determined regions."118 The space of Bleston is far from uniform. Several sites become charged with signification - the museum, the Ancient Cathedral, the New Cathedral, the movie houses - while other streets and buildings are only described in passing or are not mentioned at all. Like his attempt to use detective story structures in his journal, Revel's attempt to use the flat map of Bleston to guide him becomes a project which is complicated and undercut at every turn by his experience. When Revel first obtains a map of the city, he must revise his mental picture of the city because the city he had imagined while walking or riding the bus was not the same one laid out before him on the map: I identified the small pink block representing the spot where I was, in the northeastern quarter, close to the lefthand edge ... I picked out the few streets I could remember among those I had already seen and this revealed to me the extent of my ignorance, the regions with which I was more or less familiar being microscopic in relation to the whole . . . (Butor, 43) Revel's centered structure, the map, becomes a non-centered structure the moment he begins to use it. In the first place, the map becomes difficult to use because the index is on the reverse side: when looking at the index, Revel cannot trace the streets; when looking at the plan of the city, Revel cannot see the index. To complicate this process further, the bus routes which Revel must trace to get from one part of the city to another are not marked on the large map of the city. He has a separate map of bus routes which he must superimpose on the city map in order to find not only 897</page><page sequence="14">where he wants to go but also how to get there. When Revel is able to translate all these maps correctly, he discovers that experience changes the maps: The gray daylight shines on the map of this city which is still so unfamiliar, which conceals itself as the folds of a cloak conceal other folds . . . the map which is, so to speak, the city's ironic response to my efforts to see it whole and to take its census, forcing me at each fresh glance to admit the extent of my ignorance; the map over which in my mind other lines are superimposed, with other points of interest, other references, other networks, other systems of distribution.... (Butor, 108-09) Butor has placed a map of Bleston at the beginning of his novel, but we become aware very rapidly that, unlike the floor plan placed at the beginning of a detective novel, the map of Bleston does little to clarify Revel's trajectories. Butor also explains in "The Space of the Novel" that some places are centers of information, that they have the power to establish new relations between far distant places. Paris, for example, is a receiver and distributor of information. Works of art, in the space of the novel, are centers of information, therefore the novelist who wishes to illuminate the space of his novel introduces works of art - either real or imaginary: "[works of art] will be, then, in this realm of space as in so many others, an instrument of thought, a sensitized point through which the author inaugurates his own criticism."19 The legend of Theseus found in the Harrey tapestries becomes a sensitized point in the novel. Revel discovers the tapestries when he is waiting to get his identity card from the Bleston police. He immediately identifies with the Theseus of the tapestries because he feels in complicity with him: a hero who kills a monster (Bleston and the time lost there) in a labyrinth (Bleston). Next he assigns the roles of the legend to his life: Ariadne represents Ann Bailey, Phaedra represents Rose, Revel himself is Theseus, and Lucien, his friend, is Pirithous. Revel is once again trying to fit his experience into a pre-existent, centered structure. He wants to see his life as based on and explained by the archetypal. We recognize that Revel is coming at reality with a detective story mentality and that his experience is not parallel to the narrative of Theseus. Yet the way in which the tapestries are a mise en abyme of Revel's journal only becomes apparent when we look less at the narrative of Theseus (which is a traditional narrative like that of the detective novel) and more at the particular way in which it is told (a method which repeats the method of Revel's journal). The disposition of the artwork is such that the eighteen panels of the tapestries occupy five 898</page><page sequence="15">rooms in the museum. They are hung on walls which face one another so that once Revel traces their correct sequence, he still cannot capture the narrative in clear linear order. To look closely at one panel, Revel must turn his back on the others hung in a particular room. In the same way, Revel forgets Ann when he sees Rose, betrays Burton to impress Rose, and loses Rose when he begins to investigate Burton's accident. When Revel holds one aspect of his journal in focus, understands one panel of the time he has spent in Bleston, he finds all the other panels of time blurred, ignored, or lost completely. Revel learns with the aid of James Jenkins that he has even misunderstood the structure of each individual panel. The essential aspect of the tapestries is that they are not "single incidents but actions of some duration, so that a single panel comprises several scenes in succession" (Butor, 220). In the journal, each separate person or event that Revel mentions is placed in a context of other events, often widely separated in time. Just as one panel of the tapestries may telescope the progress of a long narrative, so one phrase of Revel's journal may telescope a long succession of events: Oh, my Ann, the Ann I knew in January, Ann who was so close to me then, whom I forsook for Rose so furtively, trying to efface all that had been between us, to pretend there had never been anything but friendship between us, Ann, whom I shall see tomorrow but in vain, since I shall never reach her with my cry of distress, my prayer for the help she might grant, if only my folly has not driven her from me irreparably, if my wretched cunning has not been too ironically successful, Ann, to whom I so long to talk today, after leaving her question unanswered for more than three months, to whom I so long to explain why, at the end of April, I bought from her a second map of Bleston and this ream of paper on which I am still scribbling. (Butor, 231-32) And for those who already know the narrative of Theseus, the particular structure of the panels and their disposition may seem unimportant. All is subsumed by the pre-existent narrative and by Revel's attempt to apply this narrative to his life once he learns the story. However, once we realize that the narrative of Theseus will not parallel Revel's experience, we are sent back to the tapestries: to their peculiar structure, to how their story is told. The dialogue of the narrative of the legend and its structure is a mise en abyme of the dialogue of the detective structure (a fixed, pre-existent form) and the way this structure is undercut and replaced in Revel's journal. It is Burton's The Bleston Murder which leads Revel to the 899</page><page sequence="16">Ancient Cathedral to look at the Murderer's Window. Revel immediately sees a resemblance between Cain and Theseus: Cain dressed like Theseus in a close-fitting cuirass with ribbons floating over his thighs, almost in the same attitude as Theseus at grips with the Minotaur, bending forward like him, his left foot on the breast of his naked victim who lies wounded, prostrate, but lifting his head a little - and yet is so unlike Theseus, as he brandishes a tree trunk with tangled roots against the red sky. (Butor, 71) And we find that when Revel recognizes that the narrative of Theseus will not serve as a mold for his experience, he then tries to mold his experiences to the fixed narrative of Cain: Revel/Theseus, the hero, exchanged for Revel/Cain, the criminal. Yet this fixed narrative is not parallel to and cannot translate Revel's experience of reality either. Once again we are sent back to the artwork, the Murderer's Window in this case, to examine its structure. Like the panels of the tapestries, the sections of the stained glass window are disposed in such a way that "to see them in their entirety you have to stand as far back as possible, but then some of the detail is invisible" (Butor, 73). Beyond this, the different sections of the window do not recount the legend of Cain in chronological order. The window is constructed in such a way that on top in the center is the crime. On either side of the crime are the events which led up to the fratricide: Cain tilling the soil; the fratricide; Cain offering corn and fruit to God. Beneath these scenes we see the sequel to the crime, but these scenes are presented out of linear order also: Cain as a vagabond on earth; Cain being branded by God; Cain the mason. Finally, across the bottom of the window we see the heirs of Cain: Jabal, father of weavers; Jubal, father of musicians; Tubalcain, father of artistic metalworkers. As with the narrative in the tapestries, the narrative of the window must be explained to Revel. Having learned the archetypal pattern, Revel tries desperately to fit it to his reality. And once again, we learn that it is not the fixed narrative which will reflect the pattern of Revel's experience but rather the action of the artist who has distorted the narrative in his work in order to fit it, however fragmentarily, to his experience of reality. Butor as bricoleur is not using these myths as a means of finding a lost origin. In fact, the moral ordering of the world we find described by the Theseus narrative is the opposite of that which we find described in the Cain narrative: Theseus, the Greek hero, kills his enemies and because of that becomes famous and celebrated; he kills his father by negligence and because of that becomes King of Athens; he founds one of the most advanced civilizations of antiquity and is banished by that same civilization. In contrast, Cain offers the fruits of his labor to God and is 900</page><page sequence="17">rejected; kills his rival (his brother) and is punished; is banished and then founds the first city, which he inhabits as father of the arts until his death. In both myths, the actions are similar, but the centered structure which gives meaning to the myths is different. Judeo-Christian origins are set in conflict with Greco-Roman origins. Revel, faced with these conflicting origins, finally comes to realize that this conflict indicates the impossibility of origin itself.20 It is not a matter of choosing. Revel, inheritor of both traditions, finds that neither will suffice to explain the architecture of reality to him, but that both play a part in that architecture. In Passing Time the mythical narratives criticize themselves; they only fit into the non-centered structure of Revel's world fragmentarily. Finally, even the texture of the prose in Passing Time reflects the tension between linearity and collage. For example, when Revel records, on May 12, his first real visit to a restaurant, the Burlington, with James Jenkins, his description is minimal: "I followed him into a second-rate cafe in Tower Street, a windowless basement" (Butor, 17). By the time Revel nears the end of his journal, however, each place, each name, recalls a myriad of events which only mean when placed in juxtaposition. On August 13 Revel mentions a restaurant, the Oriental Bamboo, and this place-name leads to an enumeration of a complicated series of events all connected with the place-name: It was that day, Saturday, April 19, just as Lucien and I had . .. drunk our last cup of green tea in the first floor room of the Oriental Bamboo, at the same table close to the window overlooking the front of the Old Cathedral, watched by the same . . yellow-skinned waiter . . wearing the same half-smile as on the occasion of that dinner in November with James, when we had talked about The Bleston Murder; or that other dinner in June with Lucien, when we had talked about J.C. Hamilton and the Bailey girls, or that lunchtime in winter, the date of which I shall find if I go on hunting . .. or that lunch last Saturday with Rose . .. it was that day, Saturday, April 19... that this man, George Burton, who so narrowly escaped death and is not quite recovered, this man whom we had not yet thought of as J.C. Hamilton, George Burton in his full health and spirits, George Burton in all his splendor, came into the room . .. (Butor, 224-25; my emphasis) In this enumeration, the chronology of events becomes a maze. As in the case of the tapestries and the Murderer's Window, we are tempted to play detective, to put the elements back into chronological order so that we can 901</page><page sequence="18">"see what they mean." In fact, our expectations lead us to straighten out the whole of Revel's journal so that events follow one another through the correct, chronological calendar year. Doing this, however, defeats meaning rather than creates it since the structure Butor has created is dependent on our understanding of the central process in the novel: relationship, the harmonics of time. Butor's prose, as a mise en abyme of this architecture, is essentially postmodern although it does not express its project in terms of overt aggression and brutality. Derrida explains that freeplay is always in tension with history, and that beyond that it is in tension with presence: "Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of the chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence . . ." (Derrida, 263-64). If we look again at each of the elements Butor has used as a mise en abyme for the whole of Passing Time, we see this interplay of absence and presence. A structure which takes as its center a non-center, that is, a function, condemns this center to continual substitution. None of the artworks in Passing Time work as total fixed structures; rather they illustrate the ever-changing relationships of the parts. Derrida points out that the recognition of freeplay leads to two diverse attitudes toward non-centered structure: As a turning toward presence, lost or impossible, of the origin, this structuralist thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad, negative, nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauistic facet of thinking of freeplay of which the Nietzschean affirmation - the joyous affirmation of the freeplay of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation - would be the other side. This affirmation then determines the non-center otherwise than as a loss of the center.... There are thus two interpretations of interpretation, of structure, of sign, of freeplay. The one seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering, a truth or an origin which is free from freeplay and from the order of the sign, and lives like an exile the necessity of interpretation. The other, which is no longer turned toward the origin, affirms freeplay and tries to pass beyond man and humanism, the name man being the name of that being who, throughout the history of metaphysics or of ontotheology - in other words, through the history of all his history - has dreamed of full presence, the reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of the game. (Derrida, 264-65) I have quoted Derrida at length because his insights apply not only to 902</page><page sequence="19">Passing Time but to the distinction between Modernism and Postmodernism. The non-centered structure he describes clearly leaves man "in situation" although it is in tension with history. We find that Revel's journal records a movement from positivism to Rousseauistic regret to complete affirmation of a non-centered structure. Once Revel discovers that he cannot "solve" his experience of reality, his journal recounts in great part a lyric despair at the loss of an origin. It is only in the last few pages that he begins to affirm freeplay, the harmonics of time. Butor, on the other hand, seems to be affirming freeplay continually by the careful construction of the dialogue between the centered and non-centered detective structures, by the careful description of each artwork used as a mise en abyme of this dialogue, and even by the very texture of the prose, which reflects the tension of a nostalgic (modernist) reaction to, and a joyous (postmodern) affirmation of, freeplay.

Much confusion has arisen from Butor's use of tradition in literary collage. For example, Arnold Weinstein, in "Order and Excess in Butor's L'Emploi du temps," Modern Fiction Studies, 16 (Spring 1970), states: "Butor in no way rejects tradition. Like Eliot, Joyce, Pound and Faulkner, he seeks to create an art which can render the present scene with fidelity while also honoring deeper, less visible ties with tradition and the past" (p. 248). The view held in my essay is that tradition is used by Eliot to search for a pre-existent origin, whether it be "the moment in the rose garden" or "the still point of the turning world"; by Pound to indicate the loss of a center, that time when the word and the thing were one. The center invests the fragments of tradition they use with meaning. Butor's use of tradition is entirely different because he does not assume a pre-existent origin. 6 "An Interview with Jorge Luis Borges," Contemporary Literature, 11 (Summer 1970), 318. 7 "Discussion," in Nouveau Roman: hier, aujourd'hui.
