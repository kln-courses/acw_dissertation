These images, only recently relin- quished by their owners, are grave-figures made by the Mijikenda peoples of southern Kenya. The presence of these objects in American and Euro- pean collections acquaints us with an art that merges the skillful rendering of human facial fea- tures with a sensual handling of simple geometric decoration. For those of us whose interest extends beyond form to questions of origin, these figures indicate a history of important formative influ- ences from outside Africa. The Mijikenda are a branch of Bantu-speakers that encompasses nine distinct groups living adjacent to one another on a north-south line inland from the ports of Malindi and Mombasa.1 Those groups which place figures upon their graves refer to such an image as a kigangu (pl. vigangu).2 These images have been known from ethnographic accounts since the beginning of the century, and seem to be limited to the Mijikenda. Only the Giryama, Chonyi, Kambe, Jibana, Ribe, and Kauma groups are known to have used rep- resentational forms in this connection (see map at right). The Detroit Institute of Arts has recently acquired a kigangu (figs. 1 and 2) that is believed to come from the Kambe, a small group in the east of the region in which vigangu were used. Its unusual form makes it one of the few exceptions to the canon of verticality that distinguishes most vigangu, which follow a schema of head, neck, and a long, plank-like support that represents - one might prefer to say "symbolizes"- a body. In a striking departure from the more usual straight-sided sil- houette of such figures, the carver of the Detroit kigangu imaginatively expanded its lower ele- ment into a flaring, two-dimensional schema of the human body, including a suggestion of arms. This feature occurs on a quite similar kigangu (fig. 3) seen and painted by Joy Adamson, who seems to have attributed it to the Kambe people, the same group associated with the Detroit example.3 As the kigangu was intended to stand erect at the head of a grave for a long time, its body was trimmed down to a narrow, flat form of rectan- gular section that could penetrate the earth suf- MAP of southeastern Kenya, showing some of the Mijikenda peoples.

The height of these images varied considerably; smaller exam- ples reached no more than three feet, while others exceeded six feet.4 The stela-like body of the kigangu fulfilled aes- thetic functions as well: it served as a field for decoration. Its front surface was divided into carefully planned, symmetrical frames containing an assortment of dentate bands, concentric circles, serpentine lines, and lozenges. Although this inventory was limited, imaginative variations in scale and juxtaposition led to many different overall patterns. In numerous instances this pen- chant for decoration became exuberant, perhaps even compulsive: the motifs completely effaced the features of the image's head, leaving in their place a highly decorated disc. The backs of these images were not often decorated, and, when they were, such embellishment was relatively mini- mal, although in a style identical to that on the front. The owners of vigangu may have placed them against a backdrop such as a house front or shrine wall that would have precluded any view from the rear. Occasionally, a low-reaching thatched roof was placed over the image in order to enshrine and protect it.5 The decorative aesthetic of the kigangu was not confined to these textural effects. Many images still show substantial traces of different pigments pressed into the depressions enclosing the champlev£ motifs. In some examples these pig- ments remain in sufficient quantity to suggest that they were intended to come flush with the image's surface, thus imparting an inlaid effect. The residue of yellow, red, and white color in the crevices of the greatly weathered Detroit kigangu suggests that newly installed images could attain spectacular effects in detailed and defined poly- chromy. This cloisonne-like technique is seldom encountered in traditional African art. Neither the Kambe nor any other Mijikenda group has yet explained the diverse forms and decora- tions of their vigangu. We may, however, gain some insight into this interplay of tradition and improvisation if we consider the social and cul- tural roles played by the kigangu in its original context of use. The kigangu is associated with burial, but even more so with the grave as a ritual site after burial. It is essential to note that it was used only on important graves. Its exclusiveness and ongoing ritual context should caution us against considering it as analogous to burial fig- ures, headstones, funerary posts, and grave mark- ers as we are accustomed to think of them. The groups associated with vigangu lived in hilly, wooded country. Before the establishment of the Pax Britannica in the 19th century, a state of war often prevailed between different Mijikenda groups. They were also subject to raids from Maa- sai and Galla herdsmen. These conditions led them to adapt the hills of their country for a dis- tinctive form of defense. Each group cleared the top of a high hill and enclosed it with a system of palisades and narrow gates. At first this sort of enclosure, called a kaya (pl. makaya),6 sufficed to contain the entire group. When internal population pressure forced seg- ments of large families to live outside its walls, the kaya continued to serve as a fortress retreat, 106</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 3. Kigangu, Kenyan, Kambe (?). After Adamson (see caption, map): pl. 20, row 2/ center. a ritual center, and a sacred place.7 The height, inaccessibility, and pervasive cultural role of the makaya recall the acropolises of the ancient Greeks. Most of what we know about the original context of vigangu depends largely upon what we can infer from descriptions of traditional Giryama society. For all their proximity to the coast and their interaction with its peoples, the traditional Mijikenda have only recently begun to be closely studied. The Giryama are the largest, most dynamic, and best known group associated with vigangu .8 The traditional Giryama were sedentary cultivators of maize. Their society was organized in two complementary ways: into close-knit clans and into an age-system that bridged family differ- ences and assured leadership in all matters vital to the community. All of the youths and adult men of the society were divided on the basis of relative age into continually ascending grades which had different names, insignia, and social roles. At the apex of the age-system were the elders of the kaya, notables who would often convene to discuss and resolve the problems of their juniors. The senior elder of a kaya was recognized as the nominal leader of his people. Elders attained sta- tus gradually, advancing through a series of for- mal recognitions, the highest of which were limited to a few distinguished leaders. A leader in a kaya was expected to learn - through initia- tion - the wisdom of the elders. He also had to belong to two associations. The more important of these was chama ya way a, a highly selective group of elders who were obliged to communi- cate with the unseen world on behalf of their dependents. This connection gave the association an important place in the regulation of Giryama social behavior; its members imposed and col- lected duties and fines. Less powerful but very important in the wide extent of its membership was chama ya gohu, to which all elders of note belonged. The Giryama have not acquainted investigators with their view of its purpose, but its pervasive importance in their life is very clear. In a number of ways it was equivalent to a West African "title society," in which a member could acquire high status and considerable authority through that association's recognition of his outstanding personal qualities and its acceptance of his entrance fee, which could be almost ruinously high. The fee to enter chama ya gohu was amassed by the candidate's clan, in conjunction with the other clans to which he was related.9 It is there- fore likely that the members of the association tended to be the heads of clans and their main lineage groups. Their place in the association would have been vital to the prestige and political power of the groups that underwrote their membership. This aspect of membership, however, would explain only the temporal concerns of the mem- bers and their families. A member of chama ya gohu also had the right to a special burial which included the placement of a kigangu at the head of his grave.10 The graves of the most important 107</page><page sequence="5">elders were often situated together at the center of the kaya near both the places of sacrifice and the houses of the elders in charge of communal ritual. Less distinguished elders were buried in front of the doorways of their own houses. The close connection between chama ya gohu and vigangu shows the deep involvement of Gir- yama society with the less comprehensible parts of its world. Through membership in chama ya gohu , elders who went into the afterworld con- tinued to serve the interests of their followers. The clan or lineage associated with a particular kigangu believed that their recently departed elder had the power to intercede for them with the nature spirits who controlled the universe. The kigangu thus served as a locus to which a deceased leader's spirit could be called. Here the shade would be propitiated and asked to secure the favorable disposition of more powerful spirits to such mortal undertakings as a risky journey or the cure of an illness. At the base of each kigangu was placed a cup - often made of a coconut shell - into which members of the family of the deceased put small offerings of palm-wine, food, snuff, etc., when they wished to gain the attention and help of their representative in the unseen world. Blood-sacrifices of goats and fowl addressed to the spirit of a deceased leader were performed upon his grave, with some of the blood running onto the kigangu or into the cup at its base.11 The Giryama concept of power residing in the kigangu ran counter to their recognition of seniority as a fundamental principle of order in the world of the living. A deceased leader would inevitably begin to fade away in the memory of his descendants, especially since other leaders of his family would be arriving successively in the afterworld. These later arrivals would presumably possess the full store of supernatural power that they had accumulated during their life, as well as a clearer understanding of the more recent needs of their families. Vigangu thus came to be aban- doned within a few generations of their installa- tion, but were allowed to stand unmolested. Yet another Giryama usage indicates the ephem- eral power of the kigangu. The groups that left the old kaya would often move from one provi- sional homestead to another before they estab- lished a new kaya. On the first move, the family group took along its most important kigangu and installed it in the new settlement. If the group moved again, the once-transplanted kigangu would remain behind, standing as a marker on the site of a village which had fallen into unrecognizable debris.12 The many field photographs of vigangu , most of which show the images standing in com- pletely open spaces,13 suggest a difference in the rate of weathering between the kigangu and Mijikenda housing materials. That there was some concern with the lasting quality of vigangu is indicated by their having been made in woods that are relatively resistant to termites. For exam- ple, the Detroit kigangu is made of the wood of the muhuhu (Brachylaena sp., probably hutch- insii),u an important and distinctive tree of the East African coastal forest. In the earlier days of Mijikenda settlement in their present area, the concepts of kaya and kigangu were closely linked. Even after the defensive need for makaya had waned, the greater number of vigangu were still to be found within their pre- cincts, especially in the case of groups other than the Giryama. Both concepts expressed the con- tinuity of Mijikenda society and tradition: the kaya insured the survival of the society in the tem- poral world, while the kigangu symbolized the order of society in the kaya and in the surround- ing world of unseen forces. As we cannot neatly separate Mijikenda religious institutions from secular ones, we should not regard the kigangu entirely as a ritual accessory. It stood on the grave as a symbol of chama ya gohu and of the wealth that this affiliation demanded. In turn, it referred to the unity and pride of the relatives who brought this wealth together and then expended it to give their leader high status. These political and economic over- tones probably resounded as well through the fashioning and installation of the kigangu. As in many other traditionally egalitarian societies of Africa, a Mijikenda family's commitment to the memory of a deceased leader and the power of his spirit would have been expressed in an effort to excel, to make a statement beyond the reach of its peers in the kaya. This striving for group distinction and prestige may have contributed strongly to the emergence of new forms and new patterns of texture and color in the vigangu. If we think of the installation of the kigangu upon the grave as a political and, in a sense, theatrical event, we may gain some insight into the unusual qualities of the Detroit kigangu and similar figures. The head of the Detroit piece strikes a curious balance between naturalism and conventionali- zation. The unmodeled, rather geometric features of its face set it apart from many of the more naturalistic vigangu , as do the length of its nose and near absence of a chin. The figure painted by Adamson (fig. 3) seems to agree closely in this regard, suggesting that it could have been carved by the same hand. A similar approach is seen in 108</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 4. Kigangu, Kenyan, Kambe (?); wood, h. 64 cm (25 in.). Collection of Count Baudouin de Grunne, Wezembeek- Oppem. a ruined kigangu - only the head and the upper part of the body remain - collected at the same time, and quite possibly in the same place, as the Detroit figure (fig. 4). The decorative carving on the fragmentary kigangu's body seems particu- larly fine, and its lower neck is flanked by traces of decorated shoulder-like panels that suggest a close relationship to the Detroit kigangu. The faces of these two images are quite similar in style. Their features are worked out as triangular masses and spaces: the eyes are suggested by more or less triangular hollows between the brow and nose, and the noses are triangular, as are the lips. One might even see the tapering outline of the face as a variation on this basic form. The close agreement between these three unusual vigangu and the quality of their workmanship suggest the work of a master carver in the context of a society which had a high regard for wealth and prestige. A family's commissioning of a fine kigangu may have represented an economic sac- rifice equivalent to buying membership in chama ya gohu. Indeed, it may have been the counter- part of that act: sending its leader through one more initiation and thereby revalidating its polit- ical position. However much an insight into the social dynam- ics of Mijikenda society may help us to under- stand the importance of innovation and fine workmanship in vigangu , it falls short of explain- ing the remarkable diversity of stylistic modes evident in the examples that we know. The images run a gamut from extreme schematization (fig. 5) to a relatively high degree of naturalism almost suggestive of portraiture (fig. 6). Photo- graphs taken of vigangu in situ at the beginning of this century15 and then again in the 1950s16 preclude the assumption that such differences derive from a single style's either having changed over time or having varied according to locality; the various modes can be seen to have coexisted in the makaya of different Mijikenda groups throughout the half-century. If the contrasting approaches to representation have any signifi- cance beyond simple aesthetic choice (which is not at all out of the question), their explanation may lie in the ideological meaning of such objects, in their reference to their subjects. Although the kigangu was thought to "memorial- ize" the deceased,17 it is not certain that it was intended as a representation of his body as it appeared in life. The geometric decoration of the image could have been an allusion to the colorful shoulder cloths that elders wore.18 In fact, token cloths were fastened to many of the vigangu. The absence of body scarification among Mijikenda men makes it unlikely that the patterns refer to this kind of adornment.19 It seems reasonable to assume that a kigangu recorded the social status of the deceased rather than his individual physi- cal characteristics; if so, this concern might account for some of the striking contrasts between the images. It is also possible that the disparate forms seen in the vigangu of a kaya might reflect the age-system of the Mijikenda, which was based on differences in social role, political power, and personal adornment. Consistent differences between the vigangu may have denoted the specific grades of elderhood attained by th e chama ya gohu mem- bers so commemorated. 109</page><page sequence="7">Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Mijikenda regarded the naturalistically modeled kind of kigangu head as more difficult to carve, and therefore more expensive to commission, we might associate the quality of naturalism with images made for the wealthiest families and the most important elders. Before the large-scale transportation of vigangu to Europe and America, comparison of the numbers of examples in dif- ferent substyles that survived in both the makaya and their outlying settlements might have shown whether the naturalistic images related to fewer individuals, and therefore, by inference, to higher FIGURE 5.

In this connection it would be worth con- sidering that while membership in chama ya gohu entitled an elder to a kigangu , membership in chama ya vaya may have entitled the most impor- tant elders to a special kind of kigangu. Another kind of Mijikenda object connected with graves and spirits of the dead provides some rea- son to relate the skillful carving of an image to the social status of its subject. Deceased men of ordinary status, women,20 and older children were represented by unworked billets of wood about one-third the height of a kigangu. These symbols were driven into the ground beside the doorways of the deceased or alongside vigangu in sheltering shrines.21 This kind of image, known as msala ya koma , received sacrifices and was regarded as a point of communication with the spirit of a particular dead person. Its supernatural power, however, was thought to be of a lesser order than that of a kigangu , and it was not trans- ferred during a move to other settlements.22 As to its position in the development of the kigangu , one cannot say with any certainty which was the prototype of the other. As much as the Detroit kigangu's exceptional fea- tures may refer back to the interaction between the lineage groups within a kaya, they also indi- cate a strong connection between the art of the Mijikenda and that of the Swahili-speaking peo- ples who live between the Mijikenda and the ocean. The decoration of the vigangu of eastern Mijikenda groups is closely related to the embel- lishment of Swahili utilitarian objects, both in technique and iconography. A comparison of the Detroit kigangu's body with a window frame in the Bajun style, a geometric Swahili idiom of the Kenya coast and islands, amply brings out this relationship (fig. 7). The Swahili-speakers are traditionally Moslem, although their interpretations of the Koran can vary greatly. Those of the Kenya coast appear to have been orthodox believers since medieval times. They are known to have very little sculp- ture representing the human form; their surviving medieval tomb-monuments are non-representa- tional.23 Their obvious sharing of a decorative style with the Mijikenda poses questions of importance to an understanding of the origins and historical development of the kigangu. The Miji- kenda are thought to have come south into their present territory at the beginning of the 1 7th cen- tury.24 Although the Swahili had occupied the coast for a considerable time before the Miji- kenda arrived, the African elements of the Swahili language show a close relationship to the Miji- kenda tongue. 110</page><page sequence="8">FIGURE 6. Vigangu from various makaya, formerly in the collection of Philippe Guimiot, Brussels. Photo: Philippe Guimiot. Swahili culture developed on the coast as a result of the long and powerful influence of Asian trad- ers and settlers - Arabs, Persians, and Indians - upon various indigenous coastal peoples. The process was gradual and varied in intensity over the area of interaction. Coastal groups related to the Mijikenda could have shared a tradition of grave-figures with them until the Islamic proscrip- tion of human images became effective. Indeed, the Swahili are likely to have adapted their own main decorative motifs, such as rosettes and qua- trefoils, from Asian sources. Since Swahili motifs appear on objects made hundreds of miles inland, we could expect them to have been taken up by the Mijikenda several centuries ago. One difficulty with the idea that the Mijikenda and Swahili shared a decorative tradition is the fact that, so far as museum collections and eth- nographic records can tell us, the only objects that the Mijikenda decorate in the Swahili manner are vigangu . Their other images and utilitarian objects tend to be devoid of this kind of decora- tion. This inconsistency leads us to wonder whether the peoples of the eastern makaya may not have borrowed the naturalistic kigangu forms and their mode of decoration from their not-quite-lslam- ized relatives on the coast. Even if this is a tenable explanation of the kigangu's seemingly disparate presence in Miji- kenda culture, it does not explain the fact that while the kigangu is distinctive of the Mijikenda, herm-like wooden grave-figures occur sporadic- ally elsewhere in East Africa. The Zaramo, a Swa- hili-speaking people of the Tanzania coast, use 111</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 7. Window Frame, Kenyan, Bajun style; wood, h. 59 cm (23 in.). National Museum, Lamu. Photo: M.D. Rose. grave-figures that differ from vigangu mainly in their cylindrical bodies.25 The Konso and Gato of southern Ethiopia install natural istical ly rounded yet highly schematized figures as commemorative images on the graves of their notables.26 The Bongo in the southwest of the Sudanese Republic use more naturalistic figures in a similar tradi- tion.27 Finally, a remarkable similarity is apparent between the kigangu form and a figure used to commemorate a man who died, far from his home, among the Antandruy at the southern end of Madagascar (fig. 8). 28 These formal and conceptual analogues of the kigangu may indicate an early sub-Saharan tra- dition which was interrupted by the Islamic pro- scription of images, leaving only isolated survivals scattered over a large region. Also of possible relevance is the use into recent times of vaguely anthropomorphic wooden stakes on Islamic graves in Morocco and Algeria.29 We are not told whether this custom is of Berber or Arab origin. Its occurrence among pre-lslamic Arabs plying the African trade route could also serve as a rea- FIGURE 8. Memorial Figure , Madagascan, Antandruy; wood. Photo: J. and M. Faubl£e. sonable explanation of the presence of some kinds of grave-figures in East Africa. We still lack the internal evidence that would lead to a definitive explanation of the origin of the kigangu form among the Mijikenda. Its existence points to a concentration of relatively sophisti- cated sculpture in a region otherwise almost entirely without representational art. As such, it makes for a paradox: it seems to have survived because of the impregnable isolation of the mak- aya, and yet it is distinguished by a foreign style of decoration. Until the Mijikenda tell us more about their past and their relations with the Swa- hili, the Detroit kigangu must stand as the symbol of a fortunate but enigmatic intersection of Afri- can and Asian cultures on the coast of the Indian Ocean. 112</page><page sequence="10">NOTES I am grateful to Mrs. Sylvia Williams, Ms. Marie Ther£se Brin- card, and Ms. Carol Beckwith for help in obtaining photographs used in this article. 1. These peoples include the Giryama, Rabai, Ribe, Kambe, Chonyi, Jibana, Kauma, Duruma, and Digo. See Joy Adamson, "Kaya und Grabfiguren der Kustenbantu in Kenya/' Paideuma 6 (1957): 252. The linguistic identity of these peoples would make it correct to refer to them according to their Bantu noun- class prefixes, i.e., as AGiryama, AKambe, AJibana, etc. For - the sake of convenience, however, only the basic nouns will be used here to refer to all Bantu-speaking groups. Until recently, the Mijikenda were known as the Nyika. They do not, however, call themselves by this name, which in Swa- hili means "people of the forest" and has connotations of the primitive and rustic. Thomas T. Spear, in "Traditional Myths and Historians' Myths: Variations on the Singwaya Theme of Miji- kenda Origins," History in Africa 1 (1974): 77, has suggested that the "alien and perjorative" term be abandoned in favor of the people's own designation. 2. Apparently not all of the Mijikenda groups refer to vigangu as such. Adamson (note 1): 254, suggests that the Chonyi, one of the smaller groups in the east, call this kind of image "kibao." This may be true of other groups as well. 3. Adamson (note 1): pl. 20, bottom row, center. Other Kambe vigangu that she depicted were in the more conventional plank- like tradition. See ibid.: pl. 20, probably second from left and third from right. 4. Measurements of museum specimens do not usually distinguish the length of the base from that of the part that stood above the ground. In many instances the bases have decayed too much to allow accurate estimates of their former length. 5. Joy Adamson, The Peoples of Kenya , New York, 1967: 293, fig. 199. 6.

This account differs considerably from a later one by Adamson ([note 5]: 291-293, fig. 199), which implies that the original kigangu was not to be removed from its site. The departing group had a substitute image made for installation at its new homestead. Adamson regarded this kind of figure, known as a kibao (see note 2 above), as a "sim- plified replica" of the original. However, her illustration of a kibao shows two figures, of which one is apparently a kigangu no more simplified than other known examples, while the other shows similar lines but hardly any sculptural or decorative detail. 13.
