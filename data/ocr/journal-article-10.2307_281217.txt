Seeman During the Middle Woodland period in eastern North America, modified human skulls are interjected into a broader pattern of "trophy"-artifact manufacture. Interpretations of these human trophies have resulted in a polarity of opinion-that they are the remains of (1) revered ancestors, or (2) defeated enemies. Both previous investigations of the problem support exclusively the "revered-ancestor" interpretation. Results of the present study, which makes use of a six-site Ohio Hopewell sample and stylistic and biological analyses, do not support this position, and are seen as reflecting a competitive component in Hopewell society. This study resurrects an old issue in eastern North American archaeology: the place of human- trophy skulls in Ohio Hopewell societies circa 50 B.C.-A.D. 350. The general topic is one that interested an earlier generation of anthropologists; for example, much of the March 17,1908, meeting of the Anthropological Society of Washington was devoted to a "demonstration of Indian trophies consisting of parts of the human body" (Hough 1908:288-289). Even at this early date, scholars agreed that the keeping of "trophies" by Native North American societies principally was motivated by two very different sentiments: (1) the curation of the remains of honored relatives, or (2) the keeping of tokens of triumph over defeated enemies. Evidence for the preeminence of the "revered- ancestors" or the "victory-tokens" alternative in a particular situation carries important implications for the broader social arena of competition and cooperation-an arena that is relevant particularly to current interpretations of Ohio Hopewell that emphasize cooperative long-distance trade, com- munity, interregional interaction, and Pax Hopewelliana (e.g., Braun and Plog 1982:517; Cantwell 1980; Essenpreis and Moseley 1984; Ford 1979; Hall 1977, 1979; Seeman 1979a; Simms 1979; Struever and Houart 1972). Ernest A. Hooton, one of the founders of American physical anthropology, studied in detail the modified and detached human skulls recovered from Turner Mound 3 in the Little Miami Valley near Cincinnati in the 1880s (Willoughby and Hooton 1922). His aging and sexing analyses indicated that all but one of these Turner trophies were either middle-aged or old adult males, and Charles Willoughby, the major author of the Turner report, concluded that "they were probably family relics, connected with or belonging to the man whose skeleton occupied the center of the grave" (Willoughby and Hooton 1922:61). Webb and Snow (1945) offer a similar interpretation, which constitutes the only other published analysis of the Ohio Hopewell human trophy material. Webb and Snow's study, based on 16 examples from Turner, 11 from the Hopewell type site, 1 from Marriott, and 1 from Seip, led them to conclude that both sexes were represented (25 males, 4 females), that Ohio Hopewell trophies were of the same physical type as other site burials, that various cutting and scraping marks present on these examples were the results of defleshing and burial processing-not from the decapitation or mutilation of enemies-and finally, that "these trophies found in Ohio Hopewell graves were Hopewellians themselves, who for reasons of honor, love, or other motives of particular consideration, were accorded this special preparation" (Webb Mark F.

Mentions of Hopewell trophy skulls in the current literature merely cite these early conclusions (e.g., Buikstra 1979:225, 233; Griffin 1979:272; Konigsberg 1985:135). Several factors have prompted my reexamination of the question of Hopewell trophy skulls and their interpretation. The most important is that recent advances in skeletal aging and sexing pro- cedures have forced a revision of previous conclusions. For example, Ruff's (1981) reanalysis of the Pecos Pueblo population led him to conclude that the earlier investigators, Hooton and Todd, consistently had missexed and over aged the sample (see also Mensforth 1986). A second factor is the realization that Charles Snow, as part of a projected but unfinished study of Hopewell osteology (Snow n.d.), examined or reexamined a large number of trophy specimens sometime after his 1945 publication with Webb; Snow's revised age and sex identifications carried somewhat different im- plications from his earlier work, casting some doubt on the 1945 study. Finally, several recent publications (e.g., Braun et al. 1982; Greber 1983; Jefferies 1976) have helped to make it clear that Hopewell human trophies indeed were geographically widespread and that their interpretation carries interregional significance (Figure 1). 566 [Vol. 53, No. 3, 1988</page><page sequence="3">OHIO HOPEWELL TROPHY-SKULL ARTIFACTS STUDY DATA The present study focuses on those Ohio Hopewell trophy skulls that can be considered artifacts in the strictest sense; that is, those which evidence purposeful cultural modification by cutting, polishing, drilling, painting, and so forth. Such a definition recognizes that isolated, unmodified examples might simply have been misplaced or redeposited as part of normal interment patterns (see Bowers 1965:475; Brown 1979:218-219, 1982:469; Mills 1909:293; O'Shea 1984:90-91). It also should be noted that skulls showing ony signs of cultural modification attributable to skeletal cleaning, as evidenced by disarticulating cuts and flesh-stripping striations, were not included because this type of modification has been demonstrated to be associated with other Hopewell mortuary programs (Budinoff 1986; Hemmings 1984). A few unmodified skulls were included in the study sample, but only if they were associated directly with culturally modified examples (e.g., the Turner Mound 3 deposit), or if their context was unambiguous, structurally complex, and very similar to clearly modified examples (compare Hopewell Mound 25, burial 34 with Hopewell Mound 25, burial 41). For purposes of this study, 39 Ohio specimens meeting these criteria were examined to document patterns of modification, and when sufficiently complete, were aged and sexed using dental eruption and wear, cranial suture closure, and visual observation of standard cranial features (see Brothwell 1972; Lovejoy 1985; Ubelaker 1978). Aging and sexing assignments were made by arranging specimens physically in a given collection along continuums from youngest to oldest and most female to most male, and then comparing them to published standards and to a graded series of aged and sexed skulls from the preagricultural, Late Woodland Libben site, Ottawa County, Ohio, prior to final assignment. Following from the aforementioned conclusions of Willoughby and Hooton, and Webb and Snow, as well as from the work of investigators in other areas concerned with the question of "trophy burial" (e.g., Fowler 1974; Fowler 1984; Harn 1975; Powell 1977; Proulx 1971), it is hypothesized that the revered ancestor interpretation will be supported to the extent that modified skulls tend to cluster in older age classes (as at Turner), while the victory-tokens interpretation will gain support to the extent that individuals tend to cluster in younger, "draft-age" categories. Both alternatives are expected to yield a disproportionately large number of males. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Modification Documented forms of modification range from massively cut maxillary and mandibular segments to crania exhibiting single drill holes (Figure 2; Table 1). Extensive cleaning striations and/or disarticulating cuts are present on over two-thirds of the sample, and represent the most common form of cultural modification noted, despite the fact that, as previously stated, this criterion alone was not sufficient for inclusion in this study. As Webb and Snow (1945) observed, cleaning in this context probably indicates some form of curation, since it would be unlikely that such a procedure would be followed by immediate burial. Curation also is suggested by the fact that certain of the crania were drilled from the interior, and that an example from Harness (OHS 7/51) had deer incisors inserted into three empty crypts. It also should be noted that a few specimens exhibit exaggerated cuts or notches that are placed properly for disarticulation, but that go well beyond functional necessity (OHS 283/237, OHS 7/54a, OHS 7/54b). The second most common form of modification documented in the sample is drill-hole perfo- ration. The positioning of these holes suggests that their purpose was probably not to facilitate "soul release," to rearticulate skeletons for Feast of the Dead ceremonies, or to drive away evil spirits (see Hall 1979:262; Redmond 1982), but rather, to allow for suspension and to serve as decoration, as Willoughby originally suggested (Willoughby and Hooton 1922:61; see also Deuel 1952:169- 170). Crania tend to have holes drilled at the top or at the bottom, and the presence of a single, large hole adjacent to the foramen magnum is a clear pattern; trophy heads carried by a thong attached to the skull base or to the upper vault are depicted in the carved shell industry at the much later Spiro site (Phillips and Brown 1984:153, 295). At the same site, trophy heads are shown Seeman] 567</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2. Variability in Ohio Hopewell trophy-skull artifacts.

The attachment of trophy-head victims to the village palisade provides still another example of suspension (Kinietz 1940:83, 362; see also Swanton 1946:693). Regarding use for decoration, perhaps the best documentation comes from the Hopewell site where one specimen (FM 56033) is incised elaborately, and another (FM 41593) evidences a small, circular, cupric stain directly centered over a small drill hole, suggesting that a copper bead once was attached hehere. A good example also is figured in Mills's (t1907:Figure 31) Harness report. Here an unburt trophy skull, probably OHS 7/56, was found sitting on a cremation with a necklace of shell beads appropriately placed below the mandible and cranial base. One of the skulls in the Turner Mound 3 deposit (PM 32415) has 12 regularly placed drill holes forming pairs of equal-sized triangles on either side of the sagittal plane. This pattern probably is decorative, but structurally is subordinate to the placement of two holes, 36 mm apart and appropriate for suspension at the vault apex, and in the same position as other Turner examples. Cutting, painting, and polishing modification are much less frequent than those from cleaning or drilling (Table 1). In reference specifically to polishing, it is worth noting that heavily polished edges of broken-out cranial bases in at least two cases (PM 32411, PM 32417) demonstrate that damage and/or purposeful removal of these bases took place prior to final inter- ment. In order to test whether the distributions of various forms of modification were at all structured, single-degree-of-freedom x2 tests were performed on a series of 10 two-by-two contingency tables. These examined the degree of dependence betwen all pairs of modification variables (present/absent), using the Yates's correction for small samples. The null hypothesis of independence could not be rejected in 9 of 10 tests (a = .05). In fact, the single significant x2 value was also the only one that exceeded a value of 1.00. These results indicate that any typological subdivision of the Ohio Hopewell trophy-skull sample based on patterns of cultural modification is not possible at this time. The Hopewell type site produced the greatest number of modified trophy skulls, as well as the greatest range of modification; this is entirely in keeping with patterns seen for other artifacts at this, the most elaborate of the Ohio Hopewell centers. Tremper and Mound City, most likely the earliest of the Ohio sites (Seeman 1977), have produced the smallest number of specimens. Also regarding distribution and modification, it should be noted that the highly modified mandibular and maxillary segments have the broadest geographic distribution and occur well beyond southern Ohio, and in both habitation and mortuary contexts. The more complete skulls, in contrast, seem limited to the major Ohio centers. Context Modified human trophy skulls principally occur in two contexts: as burial accompaniments and as nonburial deposits or offerings. The nature of the data, much of it collected in the last century, makes it difficult to isolate more specific contextual patterns. Thus, for example, it is clear that two of the modified mandibles from Harness were found with the high-ranking Burial 100 (Greber 1979: 35, 37), but the lack of comparable provenience data for other specimens from the site makes further interpretations impossible. Nonburial deposits are represented in the samples at Tremper, Seip, Marriott, and Harness, and the literature suggests that such contexts may have been somewhat more common (Mills 1909:286, 312). At Tremper the cut, drilled, and red-painted human mandibular sections (one individual) co-occurred with about 30 similarly modified bear, bobcat, and mountain lion mandibles and maxillae in the "great cache." The drilled, red-painted skull found in a postmold associated with the charnel house at Harness also deserves special comment. Its context and pattern of modification parallels to some extent the cranium found within a circle of stones at the base of Marriott Mound 1. The more striking parallel, however, is with the "cache" of nine modified red- headed woodpecker mandibles and maxillae recovered from a postmold below Mound City Mound 13 (Brown and Baby 1966:109). Red-headed woodpeckers are associated strongly with warfare in the Southeastern cosmology of the historic period, but Phillips and Brown (1984:182, xix) warn that it may be unjustified to project such a specific meaning so far back into the past. The structural parallel, however, remains. Seeman] 569</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Table 1. Ohio Hopewell Trophy Sample, Summary Data.

Age and Sex Results of skeletal-aging analysis, in direct contrast with Hooton's original assessment of the Turner material, indicate that most of the individuals in the current sample were young adults (Figure 3). Further, comparisons of age-specific mortality with patterns documented for the Ohio Late Woodland Libben site (Lovejoy et al. 1977) and the Illinois Hopewell Gibson-Klunk series (Buikstra 1976) make it clear that this is not a pattern likely to result from randomly sampling a living population. The majority of the sample cases were of "indeterminate" sex because of the few opportunities to observe sexually diagnostic characteristics; males were next most frequent, and females least frequent. These results do not support the "revered-ancestors" hypothesis as it has been presented in the literature. The argument that these artifacts represent mainly "victory tokens" gains strength correspondingly. +# ?# ?# +# +# + +# + ? + +# +# ?# +# + + + ? ?# +# +# [Vol. 53, No. 3, 1988 570</page><page sequence="7">OHIO HOPEWELL TROPHY-SKULL ARTIFACTS Table 1.

From the available literature, field notes, and catalog data, it is clear that there are (or were) at least 14 other culturally modified examples, including 3 from Ater (OHS 3062/244, OHS 3062/76, OHS 3062/ 245), 5 from Turner Mound 3 (Willoughby and Hooton 1922:60-61), 1 from Mound City Mound 7 (Baby 1956), 1 from Hopewell Mound 18 (departmental notes, Field Museum), 1 from Hopewell Mound 25 (Snow n.d.), 1 from Hopewell Mound 4 (departmental notes, Field Museum) and a minimum of 2 from the "shrine" in Seip Mound 2 (Mills 1909:286, 312). Some of these are known to be lost from the collections. Another seven or eight examples vaguely referenced in the literature (e.g., Magrath 1940; Mortine and Randles 1978) may be modified trophy skulls. Thus, it would seem reasonable to project a total Ohio Hopewell occurrence at excavated sites of 50 to 60 specimens.

CONCLUSIONS As with many aspects of Ohio Hopewell ceremonialism, human trophy skulls represent both continuity with an older, long-term tradition, and the embellishment of it to a surprising and unanticipated degree. This continuity is evidenced by the well-documented fact that artifacts made from carnivore skulls-typically the cut, ground and/or drilled mandibles and maxillae of wolves, bobcats, bears, and mountain lions-have considerable time depth in eastern North American prehistory, extending well back into the Archaic period (e.g., Parmalee 1959; Parmalee and Stephens 1972; Parmalee et al. 1972; Webb 1946; Webb and Baby 1957). Deuel (1952:170) recognized this connection in the early 1950s, and, perhaps wisely, did not go beyond noting that the entire class probably represented the tangible remains of ancestors and spirit helpers and/or tokens of success in warfare and hunting. As for the Hopewellian extension of this tradition, a specific explanation of why the embellishment led in this particular direction is, of course, problematic; there is, however, undoubtedly a general relation to the changing patterns of subsistence, settlement, and ceremonialism that mark the period. It is worth noting that this seemingly macabre turn of events reflects a broader Hopewell concern with making a variety of artifact classes-rattles, flutes, gorgets, tubes, and so forth-from human bone (e.g., Baby 1956, 1961; Mainfort et al. 1985). Willoughby and Hooton (1922:9), in fact, conclude that most of the decorated bone artifacts in Ohio Hopewell contexts were made of human bone. The data examined in this investigation show that intentionally, but minimally, modified human- skull trophies present in Ohio Hopewell sites predominantly were curated young adults, and that they primarily occurred as burial accompaniments, secondarily in nonburial deposits. This seems to fit best a pattern well documented ethnographically throughout eastern North America for the 572 [Vol. 53, No. 3, 1988</page><page sequence="9">OHIO HOPEWELL TROPHY-SKULL ARTIFACTS keeping of trophy heads taken in warfare (Bowers 1950:148-149; Fenton 1978:316; Hall 1983; Kinietz 1940:83, 85, 257, 259, 362; Owsley et al. 1977; Skinner 1915:688-689; Swanton 1946:638, 689, 690, 693; Trigger 1969:60; Trowbridge 1939). The keeping of the curated skulls of relatives, on the other hand, appears ethnographically to be limited to the Plains, and even here to be specific to the context of a few medicine bundles (Bowers 1950, 1965; Chamberlain 1982:Figure 11; Lowie 1954:37; Taylor 1975:45; Weltfish 1965:83). None of the Ohio Hopewell trophies occur in contexts that suggest medicine bundles. Thus the available ethnographic data which seem to provide addi- tional support for the results of this investigation, make it doubly interesting that the "revered- ancestors" view of the Hopewell material has gone unchallenged so long. This can be traced in large part, I suspect, to an over-emphasis on cooperation and community in current explanations of the Hopewell phenomenon. Although contemporary interpretations of Hopewell vary considerably, many fit comfortably within what could be called a "cooperative" paradigm, a paradigm in which elaborate, public ceremonialism provides a mechanism and symbolic reinforcement for a sphere of adaptive coop- eration for moving goods, food, or services across a considerable area. The specific operational contexts for such activities probably were numerous alliances of various sorts-marriage, adoption, ceremonial mortuary exchange, long-distance trade, and so forth. As Dalton (1984:950) in a similar situation notes "such alliances meant peace between allies and therefore security to conduct gift and. . trade in goods other than valuables, and provided emergency access to food and refuge." I would be among the first to agree that Hopewell must be seen as a solution to significant problems posed by the biosocial environment circa A.D. 1, but I would argue that the coo peacts of Hopewell interaction recently have been perhaps overemphasized-and the evidence for potential competition largely ignored. High levels of Hopewell cooperation imply at least some competition for resources and social position as well, and certain themes in Hopewell iconography, the elaborate patterns of Hopewell personal decoration and hairstyling, the conspicuous consumption of exotic artifacts in public ceremonies, and "monumental" earthwork construction must be seen as relating directly to both processes, not just to cooperation. Human trophy-skull artifacts fit quite comfortably within this emerging, broadened perspective on Hopewell exchange and ceremonialism (see Bender 1985; Braun 1986). Results of recent research in a variety of specific areas have contributed to the view that most Middle Woodland Hopewell populations in eastern North America were horticulturalists with modest population densities and "tribal" organization. Intergroup exchange of valuables, though comparatively intense when compared with other time periods, probably was not orchestrated as carefully as once thought. Human-skull trophy artifacts represent one of the many classes of materials with interregional distributions at this time. The present study suggests that while some of these artifacts may represent concrete ties to ancestral lineages (revered ancestors), most probably are tangible signs to potential friends and allies of success in warfare. It should come as no great surprise, therefore, that these artifacts have a very similar distribution to Hopewell platform pipes-Hall's (1977) original calumet and symbol of intergroup peace.
