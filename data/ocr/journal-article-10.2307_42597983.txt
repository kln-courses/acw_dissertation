It is my hope that publiciz- ing its existence may bring the work to light.1 If it does, the matter would be of some importance, but even if the object does not surface, I believe exploring this mystery is worthwhile. The lost object appears only in a black-and-white photograph published in a Japanese journal more than forty years ago (fig. 1). We know it is a paint- ing from the traces of brocade mounting visible in the image. The dimen- sions are not quite clear, but the painting is a European work, probably seventeenth century, in oil on canvas. The image was published under the title of Full Moon , but my view is that it represents the planet Jupiter, sur- rounded by its four moons, and that it made its way to Japan from England in 1614, arriving two years later. Those who study Japan may be familiar with Calvin French's Shiba Kõkan , which appeared in 1974 and was one of the first English monographs on a Japanese artist.2 Shiba Kõkan (1747-1818) was a pillar of Ranga (Western- style painting) in the city of Edo. Although he eventually came to repudi- ate the style, he produced many paintings and treatises on the subject of Rangaku (Western studies) between the 1780s and 1810s. He also made Japans first copperplate engravings. I was introduced to French's study as a graduate student in the 1980s, and Full Moon in the volume has continued to intrigue me ever since. It is not by Kõkan, but is inscribed by him, with a date equivalent to 1806, and an attribution to Rembrandt ("Renburantsu").3 French's source was the journal referred to above, of 1965, where the owner of the work, Michigami Hisakazu, introduced it under the hopeful title of "Watakushi no Renburanto" (My Rembrandt).4 Michigami also had in his collection a self-portrait by Kõkan in ink and color on paper, purporting to show the artist with the then-owner of the "Rembrandt," around 1806. Michigami had discovered this owner to be a merchant named Zeniya Gohei in the post town of Kanagawa (part of todays Yokohama) (fig. 2). Kõkan was a traveler, so it is possible that he was in Kanagawa in 1806, which happens to be the year he announced his retirement from painting, although he continued to work another twelve years until his death, at age seventy-one. I assume, for the purposes of this essay, that the inscription by Kõkan is authentic. Other than Michigami, French and myself, no scholar 52</page><page sequence="2">has discussed Full Moon in print, but the painting said to be Kõkarís self- portrait with Gohei (fig. 2) is included in the standard catalogue raisonné, Shiba Kökan zenshü (Shiba Kõkarís complete works), published in 1992.5 There, the editors date the work to the late Kansei era (the late 1780s), and they suggest the location depicted is Asukayama in Edo, surely because of the stele and the cherry blossoms that appear in the image, but it could be Kanagawa. The editors remark that the reproduction is a "full illustra- tion" (; zenzu ), but a comparison to Michigami s illustration shows that it is cropped, so either the editors never saw the real thing or there are two versions of the work, perhaps the latter, since they supply dimensions (fig. 3). The catalogue raisonné does not identify the two men, even though one looks like Kõkan (whose appearance is known from other self-portraits); Michigami had adduced no evidence that the other man was Gohei. How would Kõkan have known of Rembrandt? There is scant evidence that Kõkan met the delegations that made roughly annual diplomatic trips to Edo on behalf of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostin- dische Compagnie, or VOC) up until the firm went bankrupt in 1799.

Kõkan also asserts that Titsingh gave him Gérard de Lairesses Het groot schilderboek (Great book of painting) of 1707.7 It was one of the most famous introductions to Western art of the period and widely read in Europe (its English translation of 1783 is entitled The Art of Painting in All Its Branches). Lairesse knew Rembrandt, as is attested by the Rembrandt portrait of Lairesse now in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. But as Rembrandt was out of fashion by the beginning of the eighteenth century, Lairesse says that part of his purpose in writing was to repudiate him, and he makes harsh (though oblique) criticisms of the former master. Similarly, no European of Kõkan s time, later in the century, would have singled out Rembrandt as the exemplary artist of the Western tradition. It is therefore moot as to how Kõkan knew the name of Rembrandt and had the confidence to identify Full Moon as by him. There is at least one other problem. Kõkan may indeed have acquired a copy of the Lairesse, and it is documented that the book was read by Japanese scholars of Rangaku in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. But Kõkan could not have received it from Titsingh on his 1788 visit to Nagasaki, for Titsingh had left Japan permanently in 1784. French showed a publication with a reproduction of Michigami s painting to the celebrated Rembrandt scholar Seymour Slive, who informed him, as French records in a footnote to his monograph, there is "no reason to sup- port its attribution to Rembrandt."8 Michigami had forced himself to ac- cept the same conclusion, as he stated in an addendum to his article.9 1 can agree with this retraction, but consider that the painting is of value histori- cally because Michigami s investigations into the work had established that it was over three hundred years old and had traced the provenance back to Zeniya Gohei. Having been interested in this curious painting for over two decades, I decided to take up the trail during an extended stay in Japan in 2001. 1 showed Michigamis article to various scholars, but none had any informa- tion, nor even knew of it. Michigami provided an autobiographical note in his 1965 article, stating he was a medical researcher, aged sixty-three, living at an address in the Gion area of Kyoto. I decided to send a letter to the house. Although Michigami could no longer be living, there might be relatives at the place. No reply came, so I visited. The area had been bulldozed. An old woman in the neighborhood remembered a Michigami-san, but nothing more. No mem- ber of the Kyoto medical establishment had heard of him, and he published no research that might help to trace him. I then wrote to all eighteen listed Kyoto residents who shared his rather unusual family name, enclosing a photocopy of the article, an international reply coupon and my e-mail ad- dress, but, again, I received no replies. At the time, I was working on a study of British (distinct from Dutch) 54 SCREECH : NEW YEAR'S GIFT AND A PAINTING OF JUPITER</page><page sequence="4">imports to Japan in the eighteenth century, and on the image of Britain in Edo-period Japan.10 We are apt to forget that the English East India Com- pany (EIC), which was older and by all possible measures more successful in the long run than the VOC, had a trading station (or "factory," to use the period terminology) in Japan between 1613 and 1626. By the late eighteenth century, with the Dutch Republic in steep decline (invaded and made a département of France in 1795, and not restored to independent nationhood until 1814), many Japanese merchants and Western-studies scholars were aware that the European imports they saw were often of British manu- facture. In his 1787 work European Miscellany {Kõmõ zatsuwa)y Morishima Chúryõ (1754-1810), wrote the following, for example, about clocks: "In that country is a place called London, which is best in the world for clever pro- duction of self-ringing bells (jimeisho). No other country can come close. The miniature timepieces ( netsuke-dokei ) and other items brought to this land are all made there."11 Chúryõs brother was a physician to the shogun and by virtue of his position met VOC representatives whenever they were in Edo; he knewTitsingh well.12 Kökan also wrote about Britain, specifically its art, and he copied prints from London that he saw in imported folios.13 It is my contention that the " Full Moon by Rembrandt" is actually a paint- ing on another theme entirely, exported by the EIC during its period of direct trade with Japan. The EIC arrived in 1613 to find the VOC already installed on the island domain of Hirado. The challenge for the English was that the market for their main trading goods, wool, had already been cornered by the VOC. Neither company was greatly interested in Japan, and the purpose of the foundation of both was to secure Southeast Asian spices. Because what the English initially had to sell was wool, and that product was of little utility in hot climates, they sailed farther northward, to Japan, to exchange their wool for silver, which in Japan was copious; that bullion bought the cloves and nutmeg to be taken home to Amsterdam or London.14 The Court of the EIC (its governing body) thought up a clever plan: they would continue to send wool, but would also ship value-added items in which the Dutch did not deal. They had been prompted to do so by John Saris (c. 1580-1643), later to lead the first EIC voyage to Japan, and who had spent several years at the factory at Bantam on Java. On his return to England from Java, Saris composed a memorandum, Observations of Com- modities to be Bought and Sold in Japan , suggesting a wide range of goods, including velvet, gilded leather, women's cosmetics, tapestries and "painted pictures."15 Saris s second sailing, in 1614, took a large number of finished goods, of the kind he had listed in his "Observations," including some one hundred twenty oil paintings. By good fortune, the bill of lading survives for the New Years Gift , the flagship of the four-vessel voyage to Asia.16 The bill allows us to divide the paintings into four groups. The first con- tained royal gifts from James I to the Mughal emperor Jahangir as the ships would dock at the EIC factory at Surat in Gujarat on the northwest coast of the subcontinent before heading on to Bantam. A second group com- prised portraits of the English aristocracy. A third consisted of what the IMPRESSIONS 30 55</page><page sequence="5">bill terms "lascivious" paintings, meaning, probably, in the language of the period, classical nudes. Finally, there were miscellaneous works, including a set of the Five Senses , one of the Four Seasons , one of the Planetts [sic] and also a large Conversion of Saint Paul ' although the company prudently sent no other Christian themes. It is not clear which paintings were left in Surat or in Bantam. The New Years Gift did not sail on to Japan, but transferred its cargo to the Thomas , which had left London later but arrived earlier, not having called at India. The Thomas , with another English vessel, th z Advice, reached Japan in the summer of 1616. The records of the Hirado factory are fully preserved, al- though they were not well kept (the Court would later characterize them as "2 waste books . . . confusedlie entred" - not quite as bad as it sounds, since a "waste book" meant a ledger), but they do offer evidence of what arrived in Japan from the original New Years Gift cargo.17 Listed in large numbers are paintings, spectacles, "prospective glasses" (telescopes) and ceramic bottles. Close inspection of the Full Moon , even in a grainy reproduction, reveals that it is not a full moon at all, but the planet Jupiter. Misidentification as a moon probably allowed it to survive so long in Japan, since paintings of the full moon were normal household decorations in autumn. Many of the paintings brought from London would have had little relevance to the local culture, and some would probably have been destroyed during the anti- Christian fervor that began to intensify at exactly the time the paintings ar- rived. I had initially assumed the Planetts dispatched aboard the New Years Gift were anthropomorphic (such as Venus and Mars in human form), but when I considered Michigamis painting, which shows a heavenly body, I began to suspect otherwise. It occurred to me that his painting might be one of those taken out from England. The cargo bill also mentions "lascivi- ous" forms of Venus and Mars, suggesting a distinction between planets depicted as human bodies and planets depicted as heavenly. If Michigami s painting can be located, and my hypothesis proven correct, it would mean we are dealing with one of the very first documented Euro- pean works of art to have come to Japan. Moreover, Galileo published his findings on the planets in Siderius nuncius (The starry messenger) in 1610, noting the existence of Jupiter s four moons for the first time, and their four light spots are clearly rendered in the painting. This painting would provide a very early instance of the diffusion of his ideas, and so be of interest to historians of science and of Renaissance thought. The earliest representa- tion of the planets, as they actually appear, is said to be Adam Elsheimers Flight into Egypt of 1609 (fig. 4). 18 But that work shows a composite (not empirically observable) sky, spread out above the Holy Family. The real theme of the painting is the biblical narrative, and the sky, interesting as it is as an example of scientific concern, is not given special emphasis by Elsheimer. Is Michigami s painting the first depiction of Jupiter in West- ern art, and intended as part of a set of renditions of Galileos findings? It might be asked why such groundbreaking pictures would have been ex- ported, but it is likely that they were not the sole set made. Very little early seventeenth-century English painting survives, because of the Civil War 56 SCREECH : NEW YEAR'S GIFT AND A PAINTING OF JUPITER</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4. Adam Elsheimer.

Probably, if the hypothesis is correct, several sets of the Planetts were produced, of which one was thought worth experi- menting with in the Japanese market. The EIC, being merchants, kept records of price. The Hirado documents, however confusing in other ways, clearly record that the Planetts each cost three pounds sterling when purchased for export by the company in London - a middle-range cost for a painting of the period.19 The Hirado price listings can also be used by historians of English art, for whom a lack of commercial documents about cost is a limitation. The truth of the "Jupiter," if I may call it that, must remain unresolved. I have found no comments (other than Kõkans confused attribution to Rembrandt) in any Japanese source. By contrast, there are many remarks about English paintings from Mughal writers, and there are also instances of paintings left by the New Years Gift being copied and incorporated into Indian art. This research topic is ongoing. I hope that comments by Japa- nese writers, as full as those left by the Mughals, may be found, and per- haps also other paintings, still existing in Japan that match those listed in the bill of lading or the Hirado accounts. IMPRESSI O N S 30 57</page><page sequence="7">As far as the English East India Company was concerned, the exercise was a failure. It sent no paintings from London to Japan ever again. The "Jupiter" can probably not be regarded as a great work of art; few English paintings of the period are. But as a rendering of Galileo s tremendous discovery that journeyed around the world, it may be singularly important. This English attempt to send paintings to Japan has not been noted before by historians, and further investigation will, I hope, reveal a legacy resulting from this direct artistic contact. 0 Notes i.
