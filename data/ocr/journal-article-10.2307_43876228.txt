It is a mystery further amplified by the fact that architects often claim to do "critical architecture" in response to the crisis. To an insider, the motivation for such a relentless obstinacy and re- sistance to resolve or otherwise go beyond such a crisis might be equally enigmatic, yet one doesn't choose the discursive background that one inherits from previous generations of insid- ers. Indeed, one could think that crisis is a situation that needs to be resolved to allow for another period of normality, but our extremely self-reflective architectural discourse, one will quickly notice, has sustained itself by simulating a series of unresolved crises for the past decades. Politicians abhor crises, because it reveals some shortcomings in their constructed connections between rhetoric and action. Still, crisis always benefits the executive power: it produces action without the need for established legal instruments. Instead of reasoning out the kind of action to be taken by an initial endorse- ment with a legal discourse and a subsequent re-affirmation by parliamentary decisions, in the urgency of a disaster, one tries to merely not create an irreparable legal offense while catering to the immediate needs. Furthermore, in "the reality" of a crisis or disaster, the executive power of action is measured against its performance, not against its conformity to a previously set frame- work. After so much talk about the changed political climate in the United States and elsewhere has lately been heard, some 1_New York Mayor R.Giuliani handling tne crisis on 9/11/2001, Time Magazine 2J'Blur" by Diller &amp; Scofidio, Yverdon-les-bains 2002 38 Petit</page><page sequence="2">paradoxical inversions might characterize the way we conceptu- alize the "critical" aspect of architecture today. Architecture behaves comparably to executive power in politics: architects love crises. If this would justify actions, which cannot fully be accounted for discursively or critically, architects are will- ing to bring about a crisis even artificially. In a frequent example of such a productive crisis, an architect is ready to blame a con- ceptual shortcoming on a swiftly approaching deadline. Dead- lines are crucial to architects because they have the potential to transform critical weaknesses into creative licenses. Deadlines force the most critical minds into creative leaps, without which architecture cannot function. On the one hand, the occurrence of such leaps cannot really be integrated into any critical discourse, but on the other, change in architectural discourse depends largely on these leaps. Architects do not only "suffer" because of deadlines that are im- posed on them from the outside. Any architect loves to make artificial deadlines even tighter, by starting to work on projects late. At certain moments in the history of architecture, like at the Parisian École des Beaux-Arts, the imposition of deadlines was even made a structural component of the school curriculum; it seems that charrette environment, where very quick decisions translate the initial and intuitive esquisse into the rendu , creates the necessary physical fatigue to make imaginative leaps slip by critical attention and bourgeois conformism. Deadlines are merely one example of such productive crises. The love for crisis is the romantic legacy at the basis of creativity during "moderni- ty," recognizable within architecture and within culture in general. The sometimes artificially created confrontation with the sublime, in the form of an overwhelming and irrepressible "real obstacle," like the lack of time, has the power to make our preconceived concepts bend. Architects' way of thinking has an ambivalent relationship to the Heideggerian concept of Gelassenheit [letting be]; on the one hand, architects can never "let be," because the design process asks for their constant active, resolute, and "willed" input, but in the face of an approaching deadline, suddenly they tolerate a certain residue of uncontrolled effects, which might in the end, ironically, invert into the very creative substance of the project. A momentary blindness in the process of designing might turn, to speak with literary critic Paul de Man, into a condition of maxi- mum insight. So there is a desire to let some effects of excess be. As a form of executive power, architecture benefits from the paradox between the tactics of moving fast and uncritically, and the strategy of suspending decisions. One of the prominent and visible architectural discussions in American academia capitalizes on this paradox: in face of a so- called "critical" architecture, there have been some efforts to cre- ate a "post-critical" discourse in architecture. But if indeed this "new" discourse explores the performative and projective aspects 3JVIexico City Computer Center by Emilio Ambasz, published in ^Architecture d'Aujourd'hui 1 92, 1977 of theorizing, it cannot really be brought about through theoretical argumentations, academic deliberations, and through discursive diplomacy that points out differences from previous discourses. Because of criticality's reliance on differential thinking, the "post- critical" cannot use these same critical tools of argumentation and posit its teleological difference. It is clear that any post-criti- cal that argues its way out of the critical, is defined from within the critical and, as a matter of fact, has been produced by the very same people who actually call themselves "critical" in an expression of their desire to have a new kind of crisis. The post- critical is nothing else than a search for the possibility of a new crisis within the critical debates that have become too repetitive, arcane, and unimaginative. One could think that, if you want to overcome the "difficult" argumentation that characterizes the intellectualized critical approach in architecture in favor of "per- formance" and "easiness," then perform, and stop arguing about performance! But again, the post-critical never really intended to go beyond the critical: it is merely another one of the simulated crises inscribed in this mode of architectural discourse. Manfredo Tafuri -maybe the father of this legacy of criticality in architecture - along with his critical Marxist friends, loved the concept of crisis. In his introduction to The Sphere and the Laby- rinth, Tafuri leaves no doubt that crisis was to be ultimately pro- ductive, since it could multiply our views of history, origins, and languages, rather than petrify those within the limits of a singular ideology. The critical, together with the concept of crisis, was invented as a productive and projective tool. Yet, a major differ- ence between the productive for Tafuri, and the current desire for the "projective," is the position of the architect towards capital. While we all admire the accomplishments of contemporary in- dustrial design, and the ease with which ever more elegant and finely detailed computers and gadgets are produced in titanium or anodized aluminum, we feel architecture should and could reach "deeper" or "behind" a production, which depends on a version of global capital. Petit 39</page><page sequence="3">But again, architects do not really dislike the collaboration with capital, even if they give themselves an air of doing so. In fact, while they keep talking about the evil of such a system based on domination, surveillance, and control, they themselves have always been sustained by the very logic of control; the architect designs and decides, and a heavy human industry executes the decisions. The architects themselves, in revenge, are always controlled by capital. Even in the experiments of advocacy plan- ning, the role of the architect as a demiurge has hardly been displaced. There have been attempts to question this critically, and to put the concept of control in crisis. But this crisis too was merely an attempt to project a new - maybe wittier - architecture, and only marginally was it staged as a real attack on social con- ditions. As an example of architects' ambivalent relationship to capital, how would one make a statement against "the spectacu- lar" in architecture without creating an even greater spectacle, the production of which in turn is a beloved point of attack of architects and connected to the question of capitalism? Haven't we seen this in the fabulous Blur structure by Diller &amp; Scofidio at the Swiss Expo 2002 ? How strange it is to observe how even a cloud of fog could be made into the logo of an exhibition! Emilio Ambasz had also made use of the animated figure of the fog in a computer technology park he designed for Mexico City as early as 19 77. In Ambasz's project, the anecdotal image of the ever-changing fog was used as an icon for computer technology, since the materiality of the latter was too small to create the kind of constructivist spectacle that one could still admire at the World Exhibitions of the early twentieth century. The informe turned into the "image" of architecture. Famously, Philip Johnson once proclaimed that he was a whore. Shocking some, amusing many, he meant to say that in order to be an architect, he needed a job. Rem Koolhaas was even more cynical about the question of architects' relationship with capital when he proposed a project of a "Floating Pool:" a pool that is swimming in the ocean with forty architects/life saviors/ communist officers "on board," all paradoxically swimming in the direction of the Kremlin, only to end up at the seed of capitalism, Manhattan. The idea is tenuously based on the equation "action equals reaction:" If the swimmers crawled in one direction, the pool would produce a counterforce that propels its entire mass the opposite way. While the pool was almost invisible while sub- merged in the ocean, its water surface reflected the clouds of the sky, and thus made it a patch of heaven on earth - the cloud being a metaphor of continuous formal interpretation and the fig- ure of vague definitions. Koolhaas produced a situation of crisis for the swimmers in his floating pool, a metaphor for all of us architects, yet he did it because it allowed him, symptomizing his desire for change, to set up a struggle with the known architec- tural assumptions of the time. The architectural activists would have resolved to "do something" about this perverse inversion of ideological relationships produced by Koolhaas's project; maybe Tafuri was referring to this work, when he labeled Koolhaas's projects "cynical jokes?" Koolhaas, himself, hardly disturbed by the categorization of the project, relishes in his paradoxical blend of natural law and poetic invention: he created an artificial crisis based on a scientific fact (action equals reaction) as a pretext allowing a patch of heaven on earth. In the face of such obvious expressions of the longing for sudden and "non-designed" change in the projects, and possibly culmi- nating with a similar desire for change in the architect, himself reflecting the metropolitan nervousness and nihilist orientation of extreme intellectualization, one understands that we have left far behind the want to get inspired by the muse of architecture. Don't we feel ridiculous to even mention the muse, because it is too romantic an image of authenticity or merely a catchword em- bellishing a journalistic essay on the beauty of architecture, yet failing to excite our minds which we want to describe as sharp, dangerous, undercutting? Giedion might have wished for the muse to inspire the revolutionary kind of architect, when he said: "Our period demands a type of man who can restore the lost equilibrium between inner and outer reality."1 But we can sus- pect that he, too, used his longing for a balance between thinking and feeling as a way of finding a crisis to serve his cause, and, for example, propose the semblance of synthesis as a counter- point to the multiple eclecticisms of the nineteenth century! Isn't the failing muse part of what Koolhaas described, when he said: "Through our ancient evolutionary equipment, our irrepressible attention span, we helplessly register, provide insight, squeeze meaning, read intention; we cannot stop making sense out of the utterly senseless..."2 Yet, what we need for a more exciting architecture, one will presume, is in fact a situation of simulated crisis; not Giedion's "synthesis," but on the contrary, a new way of producing a rupture between the intellectual and the emotional 4_"Après l'amour" by Madelon Vriesendorp 1975, published in Delirious New York 40 Petit</page><page sequence="4">realms. The most efficient means to bring this about might not be by conferring about mood or "affect" in front of a parliament- like constellation of representatives of "the critical," but by allow- ing the emotional turmoil to surface in whatever way it will. Is it the fact that architects deal with matter, which might appear inert or static to unimaginative minds, that we have the desire for movement, change, catastrophe, and animation? One could also say that because architects deal with matter that will always obey the laws of gravity, we have the luxury to speculate about imaginative volatility ! Isn't this characteristic of architecture an extravagance that politicians cannot have, since they need to counteract a constant pull into entropy by feeding the socio-po- litical system with strategies of stability? Isn't thus architecture necessarily a site for experimentation - play, and probing - al- ways exposed to the crisis of a possible failure? For this reason, Huinzinga's Homo Ludens might have been the most accurate architectural theory after the war. The "critical" in architecture could have been seen as yet another expression of the play-in- stinct of experimental architects: a simulation of crisis! While Ta- furi lamented that the latest avant-garde architects pretended to be at civil war without having a Bastille to defend, why not trust that architecture does not only arrange physical spaces, but that it also configures the space inside people's minds in a playful manner, before mobilizing the artillery? To make an analogy, one can call to mind a well-known manifes- tation of crisis in human psychology: the midlife crisis. The emo- tional turmoil associated with it arises most often when the burden of responsibility, accountability, and seriousness has become too large. As a reaction, an artificial crisis is being produced as an instigation for action, any action provided that it is against the seen as stifling and castrating existent regulations. The midlife crisis produces an interesting mixture of profound questioning, of action towards dramatic change, and of nonchalant "letting be." A classical expression of this emotional commotion is the emphasis on the happy ridicule, the sexual drive, not excluding the related physicality and all in view of the approaching deadline (i.e. crisis) of man's finitude. Throughout the crisis of liberation from the gravity, i.e. the nor- mativity, of modern architecture in the seventies, the parallel of the simulated "radicality" of architecture with the emotions of a midlife crisis is striking. Preceding other players on the cultural and social scene, shortly before the British comic group Monty Python came up with their film The Meaning of Life, architecture inquired into its meaning: What is the meaning of architecture's life? Some already mourned the death of architecture, when, for example, Aldo Rossi named his drawings "Dieses ist lange her..." or "L'architecture assassinée," tellingly dedicated to the serious Manfredo Tafuri. Despite Tafuri's warnings about escap- ing into what Roland Barthes called the "pleasure of the text," some hoped to make architecture meaningful again by teasing out its ridiculous and frivolous side. If destabilization and animation is indeed what architects aspire to, what would be more animating than the catastrophe of be- ing caught in adultery? Funnily, at a time when the architectural scene was decried as a repressive gentlemen's club, sexuality, as an archetypal model for paradoxical tension, became a privi- leged model for the production of crisis. Architecture seemed determined to borrow strategies of destabilization from the hu- man midlife crisis, as it assimilated its body and its action, as in Madelon Vriesendorp's drawings "Flagrant délit" and "Après l'amour" which Rem Koolhaas published in Delirious New York, for example. Anthropomorphism in architecture became an attempt to make architecture perform, and -one more time- the most ef- ficient way to do so was by simulating a crisis: the Chrysler and the Empire State buildings are caught in the act... they weren't planning and discussing their intention to transgress sexually and be caught; they just did it. With this improbable comment, the critical frame of the architectural discourse had to leap; and it did! A crisis, which this certainly represents, focuses on the per- spective of buildings, which, through a newly gained promiscuity, are able to reproduce without the help of an architect; and such a crisis has the potential to question the profession as a whole. Who dares to think that the image of the "kissing towers" that we have seen in the discussion around the reconstruction of Ground Zero in New York and elsewhere, is disconnected from an archi- tectural strand that goes back to Koolhaas's socio-architectural diagrams of Delirious New York ? Didn't this crisis urge architects to rethink the relationship between buildings, so that the sexual analogy created a model for urbanization? And why not assume that the Chrysler building's casual, relaxed, and negligee pos- ture on the bed in Vriesendorp's drawings - in a mode of "letting be" - contributed to the reintroduction of the curve into architec- ture? Her poetic portrayals put in crisis the gravity of modern ar- chitecture's straight line and orthogonal geometries, and opened the door to the curvilinear shapes of the "Dutch school." The representation of the sexual has, however, lost the capac- ity to cause the emotional crisis that is needed to stimulate our imagination in search for new premises in architecture. Whereas the generation operating in the aftermath of Woodstock might have discovered that sex was their way of "promoting" crisis in the bourgeois values of the time, today we might be more aware of the possibility of a crisis in the non-sexual reproduction of cloning. This is a time after architecture's midlife crisis. The prospect of cloning has produced more speculation of di- saster in the contemporary headline news than sex. In "The Clone or the Degree Xerox of the Species," Jean Baudrillard writes that "cloning is itself a form of epidemic, of contagion, of metastasis of the species - of a species in the clutches of identi- cal reproduction and infinite proliferation, beyond sex and death. The key event here is the liquidation of sexual reproduction and, as a result, of any differentiation of - and singular destiny for - the living being." Is the indifference that is resulting from cloning not the ultimate crisis of the "critical" project, while the Petit 41</page><page sequence="5">5_"Pig City" by MVRDV, 2001 6 J' Pig City" by MVRDV, 2001 latter is ever searching for more differentiation and articulation? Should we not embrace the possibilities that cloning presents us with - as a way of introducing a new crisis! Isn't this double-bind orientation - to stick to the elaborated critical tools, and, at the same time, to expose these to the turmoil of a new crisis, the very kind of aporia architects are used to? After Giedion's de- sire for synthesis, grounded in the Hegelian triangular model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, and after Koolhaas's quest for duality, i.e. the sexual model of two members, could cloning be the pre- text for a contemporary architectural crisis, which elaborates on techniques of multiplication of sameness and indifference - the one - as opposed to either resolution or differentiation? Today, crisis is still a powerful instrument as a way of causing ar- chitectural thought to leap. As an example, it is in this mode that MVRDV presents the provocative, grotesque, funny, and absurd man-made crisis in their project for a "Pig City". The premise for the project is introduced with a droll scientific tone; an emotion- less calculation about organic farming, food consumption, pig mating, Dutch demographics and geography, introduce what its authors call "unsentimental pragmatism." This blend of Dutch research-driven design deals with the issue of cloning as it fan- tasizes about the prospect of having a massive amount of self- same creatures, the pigs, which need to be accommodated by a multitude of self-same spaces. What again was the inversion that Koolhaas talked about in Delirious New York: "Pragmatism so distorted becomes pure poetry"? The project for Pig City is presented as a kind of fictitious dead- line, a fatal ultimatum: unless we are able to erect seventy-six Pig Towers that could still be differentiated as architectural units in the Netherlands in the very near future, the time will come when we might not be able to escape the Armageddon of unarticu- lated, non-architectural space that cloned creatures, the pigs, are soliciting as a revenge on the humans. Not only their ammonia gases, but also the mere spatial proliferation that they will lay claim to, will help the pigs occupy seventy-five percent of the Netherlands! "Pig City Holland!" is our doom, the authors claim, if we don't manage to take architecture seriously by reflecting on its cloned reproduction, and figure out a way to deal with unartic- ulated, massive, spatial sameness. In this context, the "critical" is the state of mind of Cervantes' Don Quixote: there is no Bastille, but only plenty of windmills to chose from. For architecture, the simulation of a lingering crisis has been very productive, at least, throughout the past thirty years. Of course, the recognition of a crisis always presupposes a self-conscious positioning after some normality, against which the crisis is felt as a crisis. In each case, crises make the desire for change feel like a necessity brought to the subject from the outside; only thus can we make believe that there pressing and factual parameters for our architectural "research." Only when we present ourselves as "unsentimentally pragmatic," as MVRDV did for "Pig City," do we escape the arbitrariness of expressionism, and get labeled as 42 Petit</page><page sequence="6">serious planners. On the other hand, it is only because MVRDV take the risk of a search for paradoxes and absurdities, embed- ded in scientific calculations and statistical facts, that they man- age to be amongst the most creative contemporary architects. The documentary genre of their project, and also of Koolhaas's, is inscribed within a "return of the real" that can also be identi- fied in contemporary cinema with Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 911, or Morgan Spurlock's SuperSize Me. Aren't Koolhaas's SMLXL and his text 'Junkspace" bringing to light similar topics as Spurlock's documentary, although in a more sarcastic way? The newest simulated crisis in architectural thinking proposes undisputed priority to vital impositions of the world outside of the subject's mind and outside of hermetic academic deliberations. The desire for some destabilizing fatalities that can be used to ground - tenuously at first - a new way of thinking in architecture, will give Jean Baudrillard's definition of a "fatal strategy" momen- tum: "There is perhaps but one fatal strategy and only one: theory. And doubtless the only difference between a banal theory and a fatal theory is that in one strategy the subject still believes himself to be more cunning than the object, whereas in the other the object is considered more cun- ning, cynical, talented than the subject, for which it lies in wait. [...] What is inescapable is not desire, but the ironic presence of the object, its indifference and indifferent con- nections, its challenge, its seduction, and its disobedience to the symbolic order."3 If one thus wanted to escape the production of banal theories of architecture, one would have to be conscious of, and profit from, the incommensurability of historical and factual data; one would have to allow oneself to be genuinely and perversely surprised, rather than constantly attempt to be a coherent member of a cer- tain intellectual school. This does not mean that one would need to try and introduce a period of "after theory" in architecture, and throw the baby - theory - out with the bath water only because, a few decades ago, the intellectualization of architecture has dis- pensed with the interest in materials, construction technologies, detailing, statistics, and other categories of the real. Baudrillard suggests replacing banal theories with fatal theories, which take into account the ineffability of the "object." MVRDV, in their turn, have highlighted the absurdity of today's intellectual climate of legislation and financial dictates; instead of resisting them, as architects, they have extrapolated such regu- latory logic to an extreme, ultimately benefiting from the intrinsic poetic paradoxes. "Pig City" is the very seed of architectural in- vention. As project, it negotiates the internal perversions to make its own coming plausible. Notes: 1 .
