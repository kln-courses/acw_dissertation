IVES2 ABSTRACT The need for an effective combined hazards map legend for mid-latitude mountainous terrain has become increasingly urgent as two-season tourism has developed at an accelerating pace. This paper describes the process and outlines the justification of producing such a legend for mapping at a reconnaissance scale of 1:24,000. The area chosen for mapping is a section of the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains as represented on the United States Geological Survey sheet, Monarch Lake. The deriva- tion of the map itself is discussed and the practical steps taken in its production are explained. The map is included as a fold-in; its limitations and possible applications are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION Assuming that human decisions do affect the physical environment, or landscape in its totality, it is important to all who share the environment that at least certain deci- sions are made with care. But because decisions are made in one reality, the conceptual reality, and manifested in another, the physical reality, any effort to influence them must be aimed at the conceptual realm. This is because once a decision is under consideration it already may be in process of becoming part of the physical reality. One of the more effective ways of influencing people's percep- tions and conceptions of a particular space, or area, is 1Including the multi-coloured map (Plate 1) folded in. 2University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309. through maps, because maps describe space. Also, the process itself of constructing thematic, or special, maps moulds the human perception of such space. One particular administrative field which uses maps as tools to influence decision making is land-use planning. Through mapping specific aspects of a landscape, espe- cially those features that place limitations on land uses, the otherwise uninformed, or under-informed, decision makers are provided with a wider range of alternatives for effecting rational land-use policy. The popular image of high mountains embraces ice and 3Universitit Bern, Geographisches Institut, Bern 3012, Switzerland.</page><page sequence="2">56 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT snow, great rock faces, raging torrents, inclement weather, and, at lower elevations, precariously placed villages and farm houses, with fields clinging to steep slopes or overhanging deep gorges. To this could be added snow and ice avalanches, rock falls, mud flows, and floods, amongst other catastrophic processes acting under the influence of gravity. Traditionally, the world's moun- tain areas have been occupied by small groups of subsis- tence agriculturalists and pasturalists who, through gen- erations of accumulated wisdom, have learned to mini- mize the catastrophic potential of their special environ- ment. Through this process "safe" sites have become well recognized and occupied. Since about 1950, however, traditional mid-latitude mountain areas, such as the Alps, have had to absorb a massive influx of new activities, principally those asso- ciated with two-season recreation for the growing urban populations of the neighbouring lowlands. The enormous pressures created by such growth in demand for recrea- tion have all but overthrown the traditional land-use intel- ligence. Once hitherto marginal land soars in value be- cause of the pressure to build hotels, ski resort infrastruc- ture, or, in another mode of post-1950 use intensification, reservoirs for hydroelectricity or irrigation, and a new type of inexperienced mountain entrepreneur emerges. Construction occurs under such circumstances on sites previously avoided. Control passes from the mountain village to the large financial interests located far away from the development sites. An unmistakable increase in the number of disasters (floods, torrents, landslips, landslides and avalanches) occurring in the Alpine territories raises the question: What are the causes of this dangerous development? In former times, a balance existed between the vegetation, the water regime, and ero- sion, and man had no power to make drastic changes. With no modern techniques to help him, man had to trust to his instinct when siting his settlements and choosing his working methods. Our century, and especially the last decade, has seen the multiplication of anthropogenic components until they became practically dominant. These stark sentences represent the opening argument of a special study prepared by Professor Dr. H. Aulitzky, entitled Endangered Alpine Regions and Disaster Prevention Measures, for the Council of Europe, 1974. Mountain hazards mapping is far from being a widely recognized component of either regional or site specific land-use planning. This may seem surprising in view of the series of spectacular disasters that have occurred in mountain areas in recent years. This may be because many of the large-scale mountain developments are very recent and because of the relatively new awareness that manipulation of one or a few components of a landscape affect all other components. This applies particularly to the mountains of the "Western World" where a major pro- portion of human impact is due to large-scale techno- logical modification. It can also be applied to the moun- tains of the "Developing World" where population growth and deforestation resulting from the expansion of subsis- tence agriculture is the main driving force, although large-scale engineering works are by no means rare. The mountain countries of the Alps (Austria, France, Italy, West Germany, and Switzerland) have led the way in parallel development of mountain hazards mapping and legal responses to it (Aulitzky, 1974; Frutiger, 1981; de Crecy, 1981). Japan has made comparable progress (Kanakubo and Tanioka, 1980). The United States is be- ginning to follow suit (Rogers et al., 1974; Mears, 1979; Ives and Plam, 1981), although the concept of the hun- dred-year flood has been an integral part of land-use legis- lation for some time (White and Haas, 1975; Burton et al., 1978). In these countries a general understanding has arisen: it is better to identify hazardous sites while there remains time to adopt adequate zoning laws, rather than permit indiscriminate land use that leads subsequently to expenditure of public monies on a large scale to protect structures that should not have been there in the first place. While this argument can be readily defended in areas with abundance of undeveloped land, it has by no means been universally applied. Moreover, the enormous development of tourism in the Alps during the 1950s and 1960s, prior to adoption of adequate hazard-zoning legis- lation, left many areas with the inevitability of large capi- tal outlays to defend structures that should not have been built. And even in these areas, very detailed hazard de- lineation is needed to ensure appropriate defence responses. Another facet of the overall issue of mountain hazard mapping is that the majority of previous hazard-mapping activities have tended to consider one, or at best only two or three, different hazardous phenomena. This approach has serious limitations for a number of reasons: (1) re- sponse to a single type of hazard, such as snow ava- lanches, can have deleterious effects in terms of influenc- ing other phenomena, such as mountain torrents (wild- bach) or debris flows; and (2) effective overall assessment of an area demands consideration of all land-use limita- tions. The Monarch Lake Combined Mountain Geomorphic Hazards Map is the culmination of a long-term response, beginning in 1972, to address some of the problems out- lined above. It is intended as a mountain-hazards recon- naissance tool, a contribution to land-use problem resolu- tion in mountain lands. Because its evolution has been complex, the history of its development and its intellec- tual and cartographic ancestry is discussed. The ways in which several problems have been overcome and the potential uses and limitations of the map are outlined. The final printed map is part of this paper and is folded in with this issue of Mountain Research and Development (Plate I, cf. also Kienholz, 1980).</page><page sequence="3">VICKI DOW, ETAL. / 57 ANCESTRY OF THE MONARCH LAKE MAP While the Monarch Lake Map owes much to a large number of individual natural hazards-mapping ventures in many parts of the world, it derived specifically from the objectives of a research grant awarded by the NASA Of- fice of University Affairs in 1972, and continued until present. The overall objective of this grant was to deter- mine ways by which remote-sensing techniques could be applied to the solution of land-use problems in the moun- tainous section of Colorado. Early attempts focused on site-specific studies in and around mountain communities such as Crested Butte, Telluride, Ophir (Ives et al., 1976) and Vail (Ives and Krebs, 1978). The Vail study was a simple analysis of avalanche and debris-flow mapping that became the basis for changes in township land-use zoning laws and land acquisition. The work also con- tributed to the mounting wave of political activity that en- sured passage of new state-level legislation to limit uncon- trolled development of mountain land. The passage of Colorado House Bill 1041 in 1974, in effect, required the state's constituent counties to prepare maps of "geologic hazards" on a topographical base scale of 1:24,000. With the passage of House Bill 1041 the research group, supported by the original NASA grant, col- laborated with officials of the San Juan Mountain coun- ties of Ouray, San Juan, San Miguel, and Hinsdale, to develop mapping legends and produce the maps necessary for county compliance with House Bill 1041. The need for speedy production and inexpensive publication led to the completion of three series of maps in black and white at 1:24,000: avalanche hazards, geomorphic hazards, and combined hazards assessment (Ives and Bovis, 1978). For the purposes of this phase of map development, it was clearly understood that a scale of 1:24,000 would not per- mit maps suitable for final site construction surveys; the objective was rapid reconnaissance mapping of a large COLORADO FIGURE 1.

This ensured the de- piction of hazards in sufficient detail to provide land-use planners with preliminary information upon which to base an assessment of the long-term safety of a proposed development site, and to determine whether or not more detailed site surveys should be required before issuing building permits. Lack of ease of using three sets of maps and absence of graphic portrayal were limitations that were soon recog- nized. The response was a decision to attempt production of a multicoloured map that would show all hazardous natural phenomena on a single sheet. The initial intent was to convert an existing trio of maps from San Juan County. Problems with drawing a satisfactory topo- graphic base, together with the decision to produce an environmental atlas of a section of the Colorado Front Range, resulted in adoption of the Monarch Lake Quad- rangle. This was to have the added advantage of laying the foundaton for 1:50,000 scale geomorphic and ava- lanche hazards maps for the proposed new atlas (Ives et al., 1981). Concurrent with the developments described above, a group of researchers at Bern University, Switzerland, under the leadership of Professor Dr. Bruno Messerli, was experimenting with combined geomorphic hazards mapping in the Bernese Oberland. From this endeavour were produced the maps of geomorphology and combined hazards of the Grindelwald area at 1:10,000 (Kienholz, 1977, 1978). Exchanges of ideas and personnel followed, so that the Monarch Lake Map is regarded as a combined product of the two research groups of Bern University and the University of Colorado. It is published as a contribu- tion to the Unesco Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Pro- gramme and adopted for application to Nepal under the combined auspices of United Nations University and Unesco MAB. THE FIELD AREA The field area is the northwest sector of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area covered by U.S. Geological Sur- vey 7.5 minute Monarch Lake Quadrangle (Figure 1). It is bounded on the south by the fortieth parallel North and on the west by longitude 105o45' West. The Indian Peaks section of the Colorado Front Range is the longest con- tinuous uplift in Colorado as well as the easternmost ex- tension of the Rocky Mountains (Chronic and Chronic, 1972). Trending north-south, it forms the Continental Divide for much of its 20 km length. The "Indian Peaks" term derives from a group of individual summits, most in excess of 4,000 m, named for American Indian tribes, such as Navajo Peak, Pawnee Peak, and Apache Peak. The Divide itself runs along the eastern border of the map sheet, placing most of the field area on the Western</page><page sequence="4">58 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FIGURE 2.

Topographically and vegetationally, the area can be divided into two main components; above timberline, which lies at about 3,400 m, is the belt of alpine mead- ows, rock faces, talus slopes, small glaciers, and perennial snowbanks, while below lies a much more subdued topog- raphy of glaciated valley and gently dissected upland with a dense cover of montane forest, particularly fir, spruce, and pine, with some aspen (Populus tremuloides). The two altitudinal belts, for purposes of hazard delineation, can be referred to respectively as the Zone of Erosion and the Zone of Accumulation (cf. Figures 2 and 3), although small areas of accumulation occur in the former and of erosion in the latter. Figure 4 gives a simplified picture of the surficial and bedrock geology while Figure 5 provides an east-west profile. The dynamic geomorphic responses include snow avalanches, debris flows, rock falls, moun- tain torrent and flood, and landslide.

While this forfeited the ability to por- tray degree of hazard in any rigid way, greater clarity was assured. It was also reasoned that any 1:24,000 scale map would be overtaxed if more than relative degree of hazard were attempted. This re-emphasized the need to regard maps of this scale as a prelude to land-use decision mak- ing, rather than a final planning tool (Ives and Bovis, 1978). Even with these decisions, however, it was realized that the most difficult cartographic problem would be that of superimposing avalanche data without obscurring other phenomena. Four different legends were developed (not reproduced here) and four map sections of the same area were pro- duced by hand, one for each legend. The avalanche data were depicted by both symbol and colour. Multiple copies of each map were then made by colour xerox and pre- sented in an undergraduate class at the University of Colorado for subjective evaluation and, to a subsequent class, as a basis for a quiz on map interpretation. Thirty- six students participated in this process. The anticipated results of the class tests were not ob- tained although some valuable understanding emerged. One of the four legends could be dropped as much less "at- tractive," "understandable," "instructive," than the re- maining three. The quiz scores clearly indicated that the three remaining maps were complex and demanded de- tailed study and that the most serious problems lay with the legend rather than with the map. It became certain, however, that these early maps could be used by students without mountain or natural hazard experience. Never- theless, an appreciable number of the students failed to recognize avalanches as one of the chief hazards on a par- ticular site, thus re-emphasizing our primary carto- graphic problem. It was at this point that the project underwent a major readjustment. First, the change in geographic location from the San Juan Mountains to the Front Range oc- curred. Second, it was decided to go back to a remote- sensing exercise and derive new hazard in-put data. A small field test area, the Green Lakes Valley and adjacent ridges (including the Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve) close to the University of Colorado Mountain Research Station, was selected. This lies on the east side of the Con- tinental Divide and overlaps onto the Monarch Lake map area so is highly representative (Figure 1). NASA LANDSAT colour IR underflight imagery and U.S. Forest Service colour positive conventional air photography were used for laboratory interpretation. Each natural hazard phenomenon was interpreted and drawn on a separate sheet. This process, subsequently checked in the field, provided three "recording maps," so- called because not all of their contained information was transmitted to the final colour map. The three recording maps included: (1) avalanche data, (2) debris flow and landslide data, and (3) rockfall data. The field check indi- cated such a high degree of accuracy for the imagery in- terpretation that it was decided to proceed with the final mapping without further experimentation. The most common interpretive error was over-representation of rockfall source areas because insufficient allowance had been made for vertical exaggeration of relief under the stereoscope. However, before proceeding with the map- ping of the Monarch Lake quadrangle a "hazard hier- archy" was developed (Table 1) to help solve the problem of selection amongst multiple overlapping hazards. In this way, where several hazards occur on one site, the hier- archy determines which one poses the greatest threat. The other hazards, with the universal exception of avalanch- ing, are then eliminated from final map compilation. All the hazard information is retained on the unpublished re- cording maps, but only the limiting hazard, plus ava- lanches, are published on the final map. The Monarch Lake field area was then mapped and field checked, with each co-author and other members of the Indian Peaks Area environmental atlas team partici- pating. Next four sets of recording maps were compiled, the original three, plus a fourth showing flood and moun- tain torrent. Three of the recording maps were then sim- plified and combined while the avalanche data was super- imposed as the final step. The hazard hierarchy was also used during the generalization process. Thus, confirmed hazards were given preference over potential hazards, and all hazards identified as a potential rather than an actual threat were combined into a potentially unstable slope category and mapped separately. As an example of the generalization process, the six sub-categories of debris flow as depicted on the recording map were reduced to two: debrisflow a. confirmed source b. confirmed deposition c. inferred source d. inferred deposition e. potential source f. potential deposition a, b, c, and d were combined on the final map as "debris flow," while e and f were incorporated into the potentially unstable slope category. Another cartographic adjustment was the mosaic cate- gory. Given the scale limitation, it was seen that many areas of otherwise homogeneous no known hazard delinea- tion contained a scatter of small areas subject to a particu- lar hazard phenomenon. Since these could not be shown individually, the larger area was depicted as, for example, debris flow mosaic or potentially unstable slope mosaic, using alternate diagonal strips of the hazard and the no known hazard categories or other combinations as can be seen on Plate I. This determined need for the mosaic categories and further emphasized that actual planning for construc- tion in such areas will require more specific and more de- tailed surveys. The problem of catastrophic representation for the ava- lanche hazard was finally solved by using a white line to delineate avalanche paths and a white arrow to indicate direction. Active avalanches on unconfined slopes were indicated by a small white stipple and a pecked white line. Potential avalanche slopes were shown by a white tree symbol which also was intended to emphasize the impor-</page><page sequence="7">VICKI Dow, ETAL. / 61 TABLE 1 Hazard hierarchy Hazard Description FAST MOVEMENTS ACTIVE AVALANCHE Rapid downslope movement of dry or wet snow, confined to specific path and having &gt; , CONFINED PATH large starting zone, track, and well-developed runout zone.

In this way we believe that the overriding impor- tance, yet seasonal occurrence, of the avalanche hazard in this type of landscape is well defined, while the underlying geomorphic processes are not obscurred. There remained only the preparation of the final art work for submission to the printers. This was performed on the assumption that a four-colour printing process would be employed, such as the senior author has used on previous occasions (e.g. vegetation map of Niwot Ridge, Colorado, in Komarkova and Webber, 1978). The first step was to acquire an adequate base map. Since the standard print of the U.S. Geological Survey Monarch Lake 1:24,000 topographic map contains too much information, a special base was printed on scale- stable film. This contained only the topographic features, such as contour lines and elevations shown in brown, and the hydrographic features shown in blue. The forest green was omitted as both inaccurate and confusing. Beginning with this base the art work involved preparation of three overlays: 1. all black-line information on both map and legend, including lettering, boundaries between hazard units, zipatone patterns, 2. colour copy on which coloured acetate film was ap- plied to the hazard unit areas, 3. avalanche data. All three overlays were drafted on matt-finish mylar which were registered to the base map with special care before the drafting was begun. These steps are indicated in Figure 6. Several special tools and media were em- ployed in preparation of the colour overlay. To achieve</page><page sequence="8">62 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BASE MAP AVALANCHE OVERLAY BLACKLINE OVERLAY COLOR OVERLAY FIGURE 6. Schematic diagram indicating the successive steps in map preparation. uniform colours that could be duplicated in the printing process to match the original, colour acetate film (Pan- tone by Letraset) was used as the colour media. The cut- ting tool was a swivel knife, like an Exacto knife with a rotating head, which facilitated the cutting of small intri- cate shapes. The colour overlay was compiled and this proved to be the most exacting and time-consuming part of the entire drafting process. Place names and geographic and anthropomorphic fea- tures were printed with Leroy lettering set, and positioned so that lettering would not conflict with, nor obscure, the hazard information. When the lettering within the map area was complete, a large mylar "frame" was spliced onto the black-line overlay to contain title, legend, scale, and related information. This was type-set after mock-ups had been made by hand. Because the type-setters were pro- vided with a copy of the final mock-up it was possible to have the legend printed in blocks rather than individual words. The method outlined above of producing one overlay for positive black-line work, and another single overlay for all the colour art work (in this case there was also an overlay for the avalanche information) is standard pro- cedure for the four colour printing process used. USES AND LIMITATIONS Uses and limitations can be discussed under immediate and longer-range categories. First and foremost, produc- tion of the Monarch Lake Combined Mountain Geo- morphic Hazards map was an experiment by a research- oriented university team. However, it is the end product of nine years of work and, as such, we believe it is satisfac- tory in that the basic problems that we set out to tackle were solved. Immediate practical value, nevertheless, is very limited. This is because a United States Wilderness Area was deliberately chosen such that no pre-existing land-use conflict would be present to pressure the work. The one exception to this was that the first draft of the avalanche data was used by the U.S. Forest Service to justify inclusion of Arapahoe Creek valley within the Wil- derness Area rather than leave it open to logging and con- sequently, to new avalanche path initiation. Concern was not with the Monarch Lake map sheet area per se but, as indicated above, with the production of a prototype map</page><page sequence="9">VICKI DOW, ETAL. / 63 that could be used for standardized mountain hazard mapping in Colorado and, subsequently, further afield. Despite passage of the 1974 House Bill 1041, Colorado still has no standardized hazard-map legend. We believe this map lays an adequate basis for achieving this crucial objective. Perhaps the hazard hierarchy is one of the most significant aspects of this work. It is applicable anywhere because the same processes (plus others that can be added) are at work in mountain terrain world wide. Proof of the map's usefulness, however, will only be determined if, or after, it is used by many and various people and agencies. In this context the map may be criticized for requiring an expensive colour printing process. The actual cost of map production was U.S. $5,387.00 for 2,500 copies, broken down as follows: TABLE 2 Cost of map production Tools and materials $ 100.00 USGS base map 21.00 Type-setting 20.00 Printing 3200.00 Drafting (330 hours) 2046.00 TOTAL $5387.00 This, of course, does not include the cost of the time spent in development, remote-sensing, and field check- ing, nor that incurred by faculty supervision of what was essentially a master's thesis project (Dow, 1979). How- ever, total cost of map production on a regular basis using the experience acquired here is estimated at U.S. $11,000, or approximately U.S. $4.40 per sheet if 2,500 are printed. When evaluated for effectiveness against the original three-series San Juan maps (Ives and Bovis, 1978), the new map would seem more than acceptable. This is especially so when it is considered that at least the "Western World" is psychologically colour-oriented. The intent is to influence people to make decisions concerning land-use alternatives. However, determination of the political impact of the map, if any, must await the results of its distribution. It is currently being used, along with the Bernese experience, for development of prototype mountain hazards maps for the Nepal Himalaya. A final word concerning limitations is in order. The im- mediate limitations such as errors within the mapping and cartographic processes are relevant. On the whole, a high level of accuracy is claimed for the Monarch Lake map. Given another, more complex and less well-known area, the time required for map production would be more, or the standard of accuracy less. There are also a few small errors in the legend that need correcting. The most serious is that the legend inadvertently appears to indicate that active avalanche unconfined slope only occurs on rockfall areas, when in fact it overlaps all other categories. And this leads to the apparent anomaly of the unconfined ava- lanche white stipple being superimposed upon the green no known hazard category. These are relatively small points that need correction and yet should not mislead a discern- ing map reader. A final error in the legend is the inclusion of the phrase "perennial snow cover" in the description of active avalanche unconfined slope; this should have been omitted. There are also the limitations imposed by the scale of 1:24,000 and by the accuracy of the topographic base which is not equivalent to that of similar scale maps from the Alps. Ives and Plam (1981) have discussed certain as- pects of the scale limitations. The main point, worth re- iterating, is that 1:24,000, regardless of care and degree of accuracy, is a reconnaissance scale. It can be simplified to 1:50,000, as is being done for the Indian Peaks Area Environmental Atlas, but even this has required separat- ing the avalanche data to form an individual map sheet in order to preserve clarity. The early decision to eliminate any attempt to designate precise degree of hazard, is an- other scale limitation. But this is also justified because of the lack of data relating to recurrence intervals and im- pact pressures in Colorado. Finally, hazard is a qualifier applicable to natural phenomenon only where contact is made with the human element. Ultimately hazard can only be defined as part of the perception of an environ- ment by its community. And definition of what is accept- able as hazard will remain tied to the societal code prevail- ing at any one time. Thus natural, or mountain, hazard research must bridge the gap between human and natural sciences.
