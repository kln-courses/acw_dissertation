<plain_text><page sequence="1">KUBIK, GERHARD. Nyau: Maskenbunde im slid- lichen Malawi. 62 pp., illus., map, bibliogr. Vienna: Osterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1987 Some secret societies are less secret than others, and the secrecy in nyau is quite slender. Much of It could be better described as privacy: initiates do not care to be watched by non-initiates while putting on their costumes. The fear which the masked groups used to inspire remains, but much of it seems to have been engendered by government and church opposition during the colonial period, and as the performances have become more public since independence, so has the mysteriousness of nyau declined. It is now more openly acknowledged to be what many of us (and most notably Antonio Rita-Ferreira) used to suspect it was: a set of ceremonies created and maintained by deracinated men to uphold their dignity in matrilineal society, tolerated and encouraged by the women in the interests of social stability. It has never been difficult for any outsider to secure initiation into these Malawian counter- parts of masonic lodges. Moya Aliya Malamusi, whose collaboration Kubik frequently acknowledges, stumbling Inadvertently into one of the secret places, was forced to undergo the sometimes painful and humiliating initiation there and then. In colonial times, when the gatherings were still illegal, something similar happened to a Scandinavian medical practition- er, a visitor whose linguistic limitations meant that he could not be brought even to begin to understand what had happened to him. Several other interested foreigners, Kubak and Schof- feleers among them, have more deliberately submitted themselves to the experience in the cause of science, and then found (since they are honourable men) that there were parts of it which they were forever interdicted from de- scribing. What Kublk is willing and entitled to describe here is less remarkable for novelty than for the way in which he is able to reconcile sometimes conflicting views and to provide a synthesis of the subject. He does not make quite clear whether he considers initiation Into the Marava nyau a male rite de passage, though he does equate it with the Yao inyago. Kubvinidwa nyau is certainly not a prerequisite for adult status among the Maravi, as inyago, which he has eloquently described elsewhere, is among the Yao. Indeed, he gives as one of the objectives of at least the important kapoli component of nyau the termination and resolution of the cinamwale ca akazi, the socially far more important initiation of girls. The other two objectives he recognises are: the provision of a mourning ceremony following death of an initiate, and cikumbutso, a form of requiem a year later. He emphasises the association of nyau with funerary rites rather than with death itself (maliro osati imf a, as one of my own informants put it); one of the 'mysteries' of nyau may have to do with rebirth and transmigration, as it certainly has to do with the inheritance of names. A few intriguing questions remain un- answered. Nangumi, the whale, occurs m the ceremonies of people whose historical tra- ditions, deep and reliable, give no account of any seaside connexions whatsoever. Did they borrow it from inyago? Namwali is the ordinary Cella word for a girl; how does it happen that for both sexes initiation is cinamwali? The animal masks, destroyed after use, always assume the same patterns, while the anthropomorphic masks, preserved in the forbidden obscurity of the liunde, vary considerably from one group to another. Has this any symbolic significance? Do the anthropomorphic masks, as one sometimes used to suspect, have a mainly satirical and outward purpose, while the real matter of nyau is carried on by the zoomorphs? These are questions one probably would not need to ask if one were oneself an initiate. It might even be doubted whether a non-Initiate, however sympathetic, is really equipped to re- view this short book adequately. Kubik has done very well to compress into so small a compass as much as it is possible to make public on this important aspect of Central African society. A great deal of what cannot be revealed may be deduced; and after a quarter of a century one can still reflect with pleasure, though now better informed, on the parts several non- Maravi played In having the interdicts on nyau lifted, at least in part, even before Independence came.
