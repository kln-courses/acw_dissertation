He suggests that “our understanding of music relies on a play of concepts and conceptual structures that emerges from training basic cognitive ca- pacities on musical phenomena and that music theory and music analysis derive from this play” (preface, p. x). Zbikowski’s work covers an amazingly wide range of topics, domains and periods: from Pythagoras and Aristoxenos, to Rameau, to Schenker, to Meyer; from a mass by Palestrina, to string quartets by Mozart and Beethoven, to songs by Schubert and Schumann, to Gershwin’s “I got rhythm”; from cognitive science, to linguistics, to semiotics and, even, arti- ficial intelligence. This diverse material is neatly woven around the main axis of the book and is used to show that musical categories and relation- ships can be found at every level of musical understanding—from small local motives to large-scale theories about music. The book is readily ac- cessible not only to the primary target audience—music theorists and ana- lysts as well as musicologists and ethnomusicologists—but also to cogni- tive psychologists, linguists, semioticians, and researchers essentially from any other discipline because the author is very successful in giving extremely concise and clear descriptions of every musical issue involved. The first part of this review examines the fundamental components of cognitive processing that are presented in the book—that is, categorization processes, cross-domain mapping, and conceptual models and theories. The second part addresses the application and use of these cognitive processes in musical understanding. The review is geared primarily at examining criti- cally the core cognitive notions involved and their relation to music, rather than the ramifications this cognitive approach has on music theory and analysis. Basic Components of Cognitive Structure In the first part of the book, Zbikowski presents an overview of recent research on fundamental cognitive processes—namely, categorization, cross- domain mapping, and conceptual models and theories—that allow humans to organize and understand the world. These processes are described in general terms but, at the same time, special attention is given to musical understanding. An extremely concise description of the overall cognitive framework that forms the backbone of the book is the following: Concepts are taken to be essentially equivalent to categories. Concepts are combined into concep- tual models via cross-domain mapping. Conceptual models are combined together to form theories. This framework underlies the ordering of the </page> <page sequence="3"> Book Reviews 137 chapters in the first part of the book (Categorization–Cross-domain map- ping–Conceptual models and theories). Perhaps the most clear example in the book (Chapter 3; see also ex- ample in the Introduction) that illustrates this overall cognitive scheme is an example that is based on an experiment by Jeanne Bamberger with re- gards to the musical understanding developed by young children. In this experiment, children are asked to construct and play a familiar melody (e.g., “Happy Birthday”) using Montessori bells (8 bells on white bases that comprise a middle octave diatonic scale plus 13 bells on brown bases that comprise a full chromatic scale—all the bells are identical in terms of size and each bell is fixed on an independent base). Children use two gen- eral strategies to build a familiar tune: arrange bells linearly in the order in which they appear in the specific melody making use of duplicate (brown) bells when a pitch repeats, and in (ascending) scale order, in which case playing the tune is more complex but, at the same time, more flexible since the same bell can be reused in different parts of the melody. The author suggests that all the proposed cognitive processes can be seen in full play in this experiment. Concepts basic to children’s under- standing are the elementary notions of pitched sounds, the individual Montessori bell objects, pitch events that make up a melody and the notion of performing a tune (as opposed to listening to it). Through cross-domain mapping, pitch-events and bell objects are correlated, temporal relation- ships are mapped onto spatial relationships (this is evident primarily in the case of the linear arrangement of bells), and physical actions are linked with sound production. Conceptual models consist of concepts correlated by such cross-domain mappings; in this case, each bell object stands for a pitch event (even when it is not sounding), spacing between linearly ar- ranged bells may represent the relative duration of pitch events, and per- formance involves the realization of a sequence of physical actions. Theo- ries coordinate a number of such conceptual models in order to guide present and future actions. In this experiment, the first theory, which is simpler but more limited, suggests that a melody may be constructed by arranging unique-sounding objects linearly and then by traversing this object sequence unidirectionally. The second theory, which is more complex but more flex- ible, suggests that generic sounding entities can be used or reused in accor- dance with their temporal location within a melody. We will now examine each of these cognitive notions in more detail in relation to the overall cognitive framework just described. CATEGORIES AND CONCEPTS “Our ability to categorize things is a cognitive process so basic and so pervasive that it can easily escape our notice” (p. 12). To recognize a book </page> <page sequence="4"> 138 Book Reviews or a tree or a facial expression or the action of flying and so on means being able to identify each of these as a member of the category book or tree or facial expression or flying, respectively. “Categorization occurs in all sen- sory modalities and throughout the range of mental activities: we catego- rize smells and sounds, thoughts and emotions, skin sensations and physi- cal movement” (p. 12). Regarding music, “categories are where our conceptualization of music starts. If to think is to think in terms of catego- ries, then to think of music is to think in terms of musical categories” (p. 59). Concepts are taken to be closely related to categories—Zbikowski actu- ally suggests that they may be regarded as equivalent: “musical categories are concepts” (p. 60) and “we can construe musical concepts as equivalent to musical categories” (p. 326). Concepts are a result of categorization and additionally require “recognizing relationships between categories” (p. 60). The author conducts a survey of cognitive literature in regard to catego- rization. The difference between the classical and the modern views on categories is highlighted (modern view categories are referred to by the author as Type 1 categories, whereas classical categories are referred to as Type 2 categories). According to the traditional view, category member- ship is based on “individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions, such that the members of category x must have features y and z, and if something has features y and z it is a member of category x” (p. 40). The modern view suggests that categories are not so rigid and do not simply reflect the structure of the world; rather “the categories that humans use are shaped by their interaction with their environments . . . they are subject to change and modification as our thought unfolds” (p. 12). Such catego- ries do not have sharp boundaries (ambiguity of membership is possible) and category members may be more or less typical of a category (graded membership is based on the typicality of attributes found within the cat- egory). Modern categories (Type 1 categories) are defined in terms of a prototype (i.e., a weighted or unweighted collection of the most typical attribute values) and a means to measure similarity of its members to this prototype. Categories are organized into hierarchical taxonomies where the basic level is neither the lowest nor the highest level of a taxonomy but rather an in-between level of maximum utility. Zbikowski suggests that “most evidence indicates that Type 2 categories simply represent a specialized form of Type 1 categories—take a Type 1 category, specify limits for the category through the imposition of neces- sary and sufficient conditions of category membership, and you create a Type 2 category” (p. 41). Some supporters of classical categories (e.g., Sutcliffe, 1993) would disagree with this view, but initiating such a discus- sion is outside the scope of this review. However, I would like to point out that there exists one important distinction that Zbikowski does not dis- </page> <page sequence="5"> Book Reviews 139 cuss—this distinction has significant ramifications on how categorization processes may be described and more specifically on how they may be for- malized. One categorization task is category formation (or aggregation); another is category description and membership prediction. The former involves constructing a number of categories given a set of entities and a set of attributes (i.e., categories are not known in advance). The latter involves describing a category given its members and also making membership pre- dictions for new entities (in this case, categories must be known in ad- vance). The prototypical definition of category (Type 1 category) is useful for the tasks of category description and membership prediction but is meaningless in relation to the task of category formation. The reason is that a prototype is defined in terms of the most typical attributes of the category members, i.e., category members have to be known first before the prototype can be defined! So, the prototypical definition of category enters into a vicious circle as far as category formation is concerned (there are, however, other ways to use the underlying polythetic notion of Type 1 categories for category formation tasks avoiding the use of the prototype— such issues are not discussed in the book). The classical definition of cat- egory (Type 2 category) can be used for both category formation and de- scription tasks, but the expressiveness of such descriptions is poorer than the prototypical definition. In the next section of this review, we will dis- cuss more extensively how the lack of addressing this distinction may cre- ate difficulties in musical categorization processes. CROSS-DOMAIN MAPPING AND CONCEPTUAL BLENDING Cross-domain mapping is “a process through which we structure our understanding of one domain (which is typically unfamiliar or abstract) in terms of another (which is most often familiar and concrete)” (p. 13). For instance, in our culture, pitch is commonly characterized as being “high” or “low”—“mapping up-down onto pitch allows us to import the concrete relationships through which we understand physical space into the domain of music and thereby provide a coherent account of relationships through which we understand physical space” (p. 71). Cross-domain mapping in- volves establishing correspondences between the structures of two differ- ent domains and using the more familiar domain to facilitate our under- standing of the less familiar domain. Cross-domain mappings have their source in image schemata that are grounded in repeated patterns of bodily experience. The invariance prin- ciple suggests that “the best cross-domain mappings are those that pre- serve as much of the image-schematic structure of both target and source domains as possible” (p. 76). Additionally, the broader cultural framework within which music and its understanding are embedded influence the choice </page> <page sequence="6"> 140 Book Reviews of a specific mapping (i.e., mappings are not absolute but reflect cultural knowledge and practice). Conceptual blending is “a dynamic process of meaning construction that involves small, interconnected conceptual packets called mental spaces, which temporarily recruit structure from conceptual domains in response to local conditions. When blending occurs, a portion of the structure from two correlated input spaces is projected into a third, blended space” (p. 94). An underlying generic space determines the structure common to both spaces and makes possible various cross-space mappings. “The theory of conceptual blending assumes that there are structural invariances between the input spaces of a blend: these invariances, encapsulated in the elements and relations of the generic space, are what make conceptual blends pos- sible” (p. 254). Talking animals in children’s stories are an example of conceptual blending wherein concepts about humans and about animals are brought together to produce new anthropomorphic characters (p. 77–82). The generic space that enables beings (and their traits) to be related to other beings (and their traits) makes possible the mapping between the human space and a specific animal space (e.g., a donkey space) that gives rise to an anthropomorphic character (such as Milne’s character of Eeyore); in such a cross-space map- ping, a person is correlated to a donkey, the gloomy disposition of a person to the slow-moving mode of a donkey and so on. The resultant conceptual blend possesses structural features that may not be part of either of the input spaces due to the operations of composi- tion, completion, and elaboration (pp. 80–81). Composition brings together aspects of the input spaces, creating new entities. Completion uses back- ground knowledge to fill in gaps and extend the blended space created by the initial mapping. Elaboration develops the structure of the blended space further, diminishing the importance of the input spaces and giving to the new entity a more autonomous existence (for instance, a talking animal character, such as Eeyore, can take on a life of its own, becoming the pro- tagonist in new stories). CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND THEORIES “A conceptual model consists of concepts in specified relationships” (p. 109; also pp. 45 and 102). “. . . [C]oncepts and conceptual relationships are combined into conceptual models” (p. 62). “The musical concepts pro- duced by categorization and the structural relationships produced by cross- domain mapping come together in conceptual models, which provide the base for reasoning about music” (p. 327). “Conceptual models are drawn from two sources. The first, and perhaps more important, is culture, espe- </page> <page sequence="7"> Book Reviews 141 cially as it is represented by the people around us. . . . Conceptual models may also be created through cross-domain mapping” (pp. 109–110). “Con- ceptual models are thus a very basic and yet abstract construal of how the world is organized—they are examples of how concepts first become use- ful through being related to other concepts” (p. 111). It seems that the most important distinction between concepts and con- ceptual models according to Zbikowski is that the latter take into account relationships between categories/concepts and thus give a higher order cog- nitive structure than concepts. This position is, however, difficult to main- tain because even the simplest of categories require being able not only to establish similarities between category members but also to differentiate between this category and other categories. Zbikowski himself suggests that “to have concepts involves not only the process of categorization but also recognizing relationships between categories” (p. 60). The theoretical account of how conceptual models might be defined in relation to concepts conflicts with how conceptual models are used by Zbikowski in the various examples presented in the book. Conceptual models are used primarily as a representational scheme for categories (i.e., concepts). “An alternative view of category structure suggests that catego- ries are organized around conceptual models” (p. 45). The author pro- poses a simple framelike representation of interlinked nodes that essen- tially allows representing multivalued attributes of categories (pp. 41–47, 112). This representation becomes essentially equivalent to the term con- ceptual models. Almost all of the musical categories studied in the book are represented using conceptual models (see Figures 1.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7). It seems that the notion of conceptual models used by Zbikowski is closer to what the actual term implies—i.e., models of concepts—rather than a kind of cognitive structure that is of the same sort with concepts but at a higher level of organization. The following assertions by Zbikowski cannot all be true at the same time: “categories are concepts” (p. 60), “a conceptual model consists of concepts in specified relationships” (p. 109), “conceptual model for a cat- egory” (p. 47). The offending term seems to be conceptual model because of its simultaneous conflicting dual function, that of a cognitive structure and of a representational scheme. A way to resolve this problem is to take the word concept to refer to “the idea or notion by which an intelligence is able to understand some aspect of the world” and category to refer to “a class or set of entities (they could, for example, be objects, actions, states, qualities) which are grouped together on the basis of some criterion or rule. . . . Given such a categoriza- tion rule, we can speak of the category associated with any concept, as the class of entities that pass the categorization rule” (Hampton &amp; Dubois, </page> <page sequence="8"> 142 Book Reviews 1993, p. 13). Concepts can be very simple or very complex, making use of cultural knowledge to various degrees. Concepts can then be represented in various ways: from binary feature lists, to simple frames that allow rep- resentation of multivalued attributes and structural relations, to recursive frames that allow frames within frames and so on (Barsalou &amp; Hale, 1993). Finally, the notion of theory is introduced, bringing closer together seem- ingly disparate accounts of theory such as scientific theories, cultural theo- ries, theories in very young children, cognitive theories, and music theories. Theories that are given a central status in this discussion are theories that are framed relative to a cognitive perspective. “Theories, in contrast [to conceptual models], are extended structures that coordinate a number of conceptual models to provide a more comprehensive account of the world” (p. 98). Basic features of theories are that they guide understanding and reasoning, provide answers to conceptual puzzles, simplify reality and change dynamically over time (pp. 130–131). Having presented some of the core cognitive notions of the first part of the book along with some caveats regarding their definitions and usage, I would like to point out that these chapters are full of very interesting refer- ences to relevant cognitive research and thought-provoking insights into how humans make sense of the world. These references and insights en- gage readers and open up new ways of thinking about thinking and more specifically about musical thinking. One of the aspects of Zbikowski’s work that I find most appealing is his constant reminders that human under- standing is not absolute—that categories and models and theories are all influenced by personal factors and context and culture. “The models we choose for our characterizations of music tell us at least as much about ourselves as they do about music” (p. 324). Cognitive Processes in Musical Understanding The aforementioned cognitive processes are paramount in our under- standing of music. Zbikowski presents a wide range of musical domains in which such processes can be seen at full play. Throughout the book, musi- cal examples are presented but the special focus of the second section is musical analysis and theory. The amazing diversity of musical themes that are examined by the author is impossible to present in such short space— herein, only a glimpse into these rich studies of musical understanding is presented and a limited number of them are selected to highlight the impor- tance of the suggested underlying cognitive processes. In the following section, the role categorization processes play in musi- cal tasks is presented and in the section after that, we focus on musical applications of cross-domain mapping and conceptual blending. </page> <page sequence="9"> Book Reviews 143 CATEGORIZATION IN MUSIC Following Umberto Eco’s proposal, Zbikowski links musical communi- cation to semiotics. “The organization of musical elements into systematic structures is part and parcel of meaning construction” (p. 139). Musical works are not merely unstructured sequences of elementary events (i.e., notes); they are rather a system consisting of categories of musical materi- als (e.g., motives, themes and so on) linked together within a complex struc- ture; this system is often referred to as musical syntax. “Musical syntax is where any semiotics of music must begin” (p. 138). Pioneering work by N. Ruwet (1966, 1972), J.-J. Nattiez (1975, 1982, 1990) and others (see overviews in Cook, 1987; Dunsby &amp; Whittall, 1988; Monelle, 1992) on musical semiotics, and especially the musical analytic framework of paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, is particularly rel- evant in this enterprise (not mentioned by Zbikowski). Even though with- out immediate reference to cognitive categories, much of this work is in line with Zbikowski’s cognitive approach to motivic analysis, often pro- viding a more systematic method for analysis. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that there exists recent psychological research in musical cat- egorization tasks (Clarke &amp; Dibben, 1997; Deliège, 1996, 1997, 2001a, 2001b; Lamont &amp; Dibben, 2001; Koniari, Predazzer, &amp; Mélen, 2001; Mélen &amp; Wachsmann, 2001) and also computational approaches (Cambouropoulos, 1998, 2001, 2003; Cambouropoulos &amp; Widmer, 2000; Höthker, Hörnel, &amp; Anagnostopoulou, 2001; Rolland &amp; Ganascia, 1999). Zbikowski suggests that musical motives (in line with Schoenberg’s ac- count of motives and musical coherence) are categories at the basic level that have the properties of prototypical categories (Type 1 categories) in the sense that some motive instances are more or less typical. Such motives are organized, giving rise to musical syntactic structures that make music meaningful. The motive forms from the opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony are presented “as a means of developing a preliminary understanding of the concepts and relationships constituent of a conceptual model for a cat- egory” (p. 46). The proposed conceptual model consists of four attributes: (a) rhythmic pattern (three quarter-notes followed by a metrically accented half note in a 2/4 metric structure), (b) orchestration (stated by full orches- tra), (c) dynamics (fortissimo), and (d) intervallic pattern (three repeated notes followed by a descending diatonic third). This is essentially the pro- totype of the motive. Despite the fact that these specific attribute values (except rhythmic pattern) are not the most frequent among the instances of the motive (pp. 46–47), they are considered to be the most typical because they are stated most often at the very beginning of the symphony (typical- ity is affected not only by frequency of occurrence but other factors as well </page> <page sequence="10"> 144 Book Reviews such as anteriority, stability, and so on) and because of our more global knowledge of what counts as a musical theme (pp. 47–48). One additional aspect that could be added to this conceptual model is weighting each at- tribute according to its predictiveness of the motive instances. The primary function of this conceptual model is “to supply a guide for reasoning about accepted and potential members of the category” (p. 46). The author, however, does not say explicitly why he selected the specific melodic patterns as instances of this motive. Only once such members are know can one construct a prototype of the sort suggested above. The fact is that these instances cannot have been grouped by orchestration, dynamics, or even intervallic pattern, but rather are grouped primarily by the shared rhythmic pattern (three quarter notes followed by a metrically accented long note in a 2/4 metric structure), which is actually a defining attribute (in the sense of a classical category—Type 2 category). The prototypical conceptual model presented earlier is not useful in terms of showing how the motivic category is constructed (unless only the first couple of instances are considered) but only in describing it after members of the motive are known. Further motivic analyses are presented in the book that illustrate the idea of the motive viewed as a cognitive category. The various versions of the Leidensmotiv that appear in Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde are examined in Chapter 1 whereas in Chapter 4 four additional extensive analyses are presented: Musicalisches Würfelspiel, which is a musical game attributed to W. A. Mozart, the first movement (Allegro) of the String Quartet in C major (K. 465) by Mozart, and the first movements of String Quartets Op. 18, No. 1 and No. 6 by Beethoven. Musicalisches Würfelspiel is an excel- lent example that illustrates the notion of musical category—in this musi- cal game, equivalence classes of musical excerpts are used from which in- stances can be randomly chosen using dice in order to compose a waltz. For each of the first movements of the three string quartets, the structure of the principal motives is studied by using conceptual models—many inter- esting issues are raised by the author in regard to the way compositional strategies and musical syntax can give rise to musical meaning. From the three string quartet examples, we will turn our attention on the motivic structure of the first movement (Allegro) of the String Quartet in C major (K. 465) by Mozart (pp. 154–168) in order to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the proposed analysis. The focus of this presentation is the categorical structure of the principal motive rather than the syntactic properties of its various instances within the Allegro. In Figure 1, all the instances of the principal motive category are depicted organized in four subgroups (α, β, γ &amp; δ) according to their typicality as to the category’s prototype—measure numbers on the top left side of each motive instance indicate the positions at which repeating or transposed instances occur— </page> <page sequence="11"> Book Reviews 145 notes in parentheses indicate notes that are not included in the motivic material. The conceptual model (or prototype) around which this motive is structured is the following: (a) a rhythmic pattern that spans two measures of common time                                     (b) a specific interval structure, i.e., a sustained first note followed by an ascending stepwise motion through a third, an upward skip of a third and a downward step, and (c) an implied harmonic change from the first to the second measure. Motive group α consists of the prototypical form (or exemplar) of the motive, which re- peats 9 times, preserving fully its intervallic and rhythmic content. Motive instances of motive form groups β, γ, and δ are closer or more distant from the prototype, which means more typical or atypical of the category. Using this taxonomy of the different forms of the principal motive in terms of typicality, Zbikowski unfolds an exciting journey into the syntactic struc- ture of the first movement of this string quartet. Some questions will be raised in relation to the motive forms illustrated in Figure 1. Why choose four groups of motive instances according to typi- cality and not less or more? What are the criteria by which these instances have been chosen as members of the main motive and how is their typical- ity measured? How has the specific segmentation that delimits the pro- posed motive instances/fragments been constructed? In describing a Type 1 category, the prototype itself is not sufficient; a criterion is also required that can tell us when a specific instance is close enough or similar enough to the prototype to be considered a member of the category. Such a criterion is only implicit in Zbikowski’s analysis— musical intuition guides the process quite successfully, but I think that making one’s criteria explicit is an important part of a systematic cognitively based approach to motivic analysis. For instance, what are the criteria by which instances of category δ are considered members of the motivic cat- egory? Are contour and rhythmic pattern of such short melodic patterns sufficient to characterize them? Why are other instances (e.g., in mm. 49, 50, 160, 161, 168, and 169) in the Allegro that have these attributes not included in this category? For motive form groups β, γ, and δ, we are not given any explicit similarity criteria of their instances to the prototype that can guide the typicality assessment procedure. Should, for example, the instance of measure 165 be in group β (being so similar and temporally close to instances of mm. 163, 164, and 166)? Why not consider some instances of group γ that preserve the full rhythmic pattern of the proto- type as closer to the prototype than some instances of β with different rhythmic endings? Should group γ be split into more groups with different levels of typicality (some instances seem to be less typical than others)? Leaving aside issues regarding the provision of a more systematic cognitively based method for motivic analysis, another important issue is that of segmentation. Zbikowski suggests that “categories constitute an ( </page> <page sequence="12"> 146 Book Reviews Prototypical Motive Form α Motive Forms β Fig. 1.

Musical catego- ries can absorb many of the functions of groups—specifically, the role of the group as the first level of organization for musical phenomena—but do not require absolute contiguity or strict hierarchical organization” (p. 60). Unfortunately, he does not elaborate on this very interesting proposal. How Zbikowski’s account of categories takes into consideration segmentation issues is unclear. In practice, the motivic analysis of this string quartet raises a number of questions. In many occasions “natural” groupings of notes are broken for reasons of motivic categorization—see cases in Figure 1 where slurs extend beyond the last note of motive instances and cases where a single note (in parentheses) followed by a rest is left out of the melodic segment. Perceptually it is very unlikely that a listener would exclude such single notes from the perceptual gestalt grouping of such melodic gestures (strangely this last note is included in instances of mm. 126 and 127). In a cognitive account of motivic categories, music cognition should not be side- lined because of abstract analytical considerations. The motivic analyses presented in the book show the importance of view- ing motives as cognitive categories. Further research is necessary for creat- ing a more elaborate systematic account of motivic categorization processes. Such an attempt would benefit greatly by a broader interdisciplinary col- laboration between music theorists/analysts, cognitive psychologists, and computer scientists. Apart from music theoretical work, empirical research and computational modeling may assist in explicating the categorization processes through which humans understand musical structure. Categorization processes are not restricted to musical analysis at the motivic level. In Chapter 5, Zbikowski skillfully moves to a different level of human understanding that involves broader musical and cultural issues. An entire work of music is viewed as a category that includes all the scores, performances, adaptations, and anything that is thought to represent it. Such a category is negotiated and formed within a specific culture and is ultimately responsible for the ontological status of a musical work. “Musical works can be thought of as Type 1 categories and . . . such categories are a manifestation of cultural knowledge” (p. 203). Two songs from the beginning of the twentieth century (Gershwin’s “I Got Rhythm” and Henderson &amp; Dixon’s “Bye Bye Blackbird”) are chosen for studying this issue because they are not associated exclusively with a musical score but are rather part of a more fluid performance tradition that allows a certain degree of improvisation. The first song, “I Got Rhythm,” appeared in a number of competing versions during the 1930s and 1940s. Ten of these different recorded ver- sions are examined in the light of a series of changing conceptual models: a pop-music model, a jazz-standard model, and an improvisation model. Each of these models essentially sums up the prototypical properties of the song </page> <page sequence="15"> Book Reviews 149 performance style. For instance, the pop-music model for the category per- formances of “I Got Rhythm” is characterized by the following properties: the music materials for the verse and refrain (in AABA’ form), the lyrics (which are optional for the verse), the intent to be used for entertainment or dancing (performers use variation but little improvisation), and the lively affect of performance (p. 214). These models highlight aspects of perfor- mance that are common to all the song versions but also those aspects that enable differentiation between the various performance traditions. For the second song, “Bye Bye Blackbird” (written as a popular song in the 1920s and transformed into a jazz tune in 1956 by Miles Davis), one can identify coexisting conceptual models that are drastically different. Such models are examined by Zbikowski not only in regard to performance char- acteristics but also in relation to the cultural and social context within which such performance takes place. These conflicting models are viewed in the light of theories of rhetorical discourse—especially Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of double-voiced discourse and Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s notion of Signifyin(g)—and cultural theory of information exchange. At the end of this chapter, Zbikowski suggests that “perhaps the most intriguing consequence of the argument put forth in this chapter is that, if musical works are cognitive categories, and if music is a cognitive category, then music theory is about the study of categories or—more typically—the study of conceptual models around which musical categories are organized. Understood this way, music theory immediately escapes the gravitational force field of “the text” that at times has kept the literary criticism of the previous generation earthbound (even while remaining relentlessly recon- dite). Thus liberated, music theory’s own traditions of high abstraction and unabashed pragmatism may yet find a place in contemporary intellectual discourse” (p. 242). MUSICAL CROSS-DOMAIN MAPPING AND CONCEPTUAL BLENDING Cross-domain mapping is important in musical understanding because it enables connections to be made between musical concepts and concepts from other domains. Additionally, it allows us “to ground our descriptions of elusive musical phenomena in concepts derived from everyday experi- ence, since the structural relations basic to cross-domain mapping have their source in repeated patterns of bodily experience—that is, in image schemata” (p. 76). Conceptual metaphors (pp. 65–68) involve a cognitive mapping between two different domains. The conceptual metaphor “pitch relationships are relationships in vertical space” maps spatial orientations such as up-down onto the pitch continuum—pitch is characterized as being “high” or “low.” Common as it may seem, this mapping is by no means universal—other cultures may use different mappings. The Greek theorists of antiquity used </page> <page sequence="16"> 150 Book Reviews oxys meaning “sharp” or “pointed” and barys meaning “heavy” to char- acterize pitch. The Kaluli of Papua New Guinea use waterfall characteris- tics to describe aspects of melodic pitch. In Bali and Java, pitch is charac- terized in terms of physical size such as “small” and “large.” The Suyà of the Amazon use age relationships such as “young” and “old.” Cross-domain mapping can be encountered in many musical phenom- ena, from musical text painting—for instance, text painting in Palestrina’s work (pp. 63–65, 73–74, 83)—to musical theory itself—for instance, to- nality seen as a reflection of logic, as psychological energetics or as gravity (pp. 74–76), to theories of musical form and hierarchy of the eighteenth and nineteenth century viewed from the perspective of extramusical mod- els of that period (Chapter 7). During the eighteenth century, musical form was regarded as “dealing with the very essence of musical works: how musical materials were ar- ranged and correlated over the course of a piece of music” (p. 288). Mod- els of language (grammar and rhetoric), biology (organicism), and archi- tecture were mapped onto music by music theorists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century (e.g., Mattheson, Riepel, Koch, Sulzer, Reicha, Marx, Riemann) in their accounts of musical form. Zbikowski suggests that some mappings (involving grammar or architecture) emphasize a more static constructivist perspective of musical form: elementary musical building blocks are brought together to give rise to a coherent musical structure. Other mappings (involving rhetoric or organicism) emphasize a more dy- namic approach: music seen as possessing the persuasive powers of rheto- ric or as some sort of organism that grows out of a motivic seed. “. . . the cross-domain mappings we use in our theories of music are more than simple curiosities of language, for these mappings have everything to do with our understanding of how music is organized, along with what counts as music in the first place” (p. 306). In the second half of Chapter 7, the role of mappings from two models of hierarchic organization onto musical structure is illustrated in regards to three analyses by Edward Cone, Leonard Meyer, and Robert Morgan of the first eight measures of the theme from the opening movement of Mozart’s Piano Sonata in A Major K. 331. The first model, which gives rise to chain- of-being hierarchies, views hierarchy “as a matter of control: each level in a hierarchy (with the exception those at the extremes) controls the next- lower level and is itself controlled by the next-higher level” (p. 289). This model gives least prominence to the level of the musical surface and has most commonly been mapped onto the domain of musical pitch. The sec- ond model, which gives rise to atomistic hierarchies, “relies more on a componential approach: the elements of level A of the hierarchy combine to make up individual elements at the next-higher level (level B of the hier- archy) . . . and so on, until the account of hierarchy is exhausted” (p. 289). This model considers “the simplest and most readily apprehended of musi- </page> <page sequence="17"> Book Reviews 151 cal materials” (p. 322) as the essential level that gives rise to larger scale hierarchic structures, and has most often been mapped onto the domain of musical meter. Zbikowski suggests that Morgan’s analysis relies on a map- ping from the first model and Meyer’s analysis relies on a mapping from the second model, whereas Cone’s analysis draws on both models, forging “a single account of musical rhythm that recognizes both hierarchic para- digms but which is restricted to neither” (p. 323). Different underlying models of hierarchy give rise to different musical analyses and, ultimately, different ways of understanding musical structure. Conceptual blending may involve blending musical spaces with any do- main of thought. Zbikowski examines primarily musical blends between musical and linguistic domains (pp. 82–89 and Chapter 6) but also pre- sents a blend that involves associations between instrumental music and an extramusical program (pp. 89–94). Regarding the latter, the associations of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6 in F Major, Op. 68 (“Pastorale”) to extramusical programs are examined in relation to Tovey’s analysis of the symphony. Conceptual blending is discussed at length in Chapter 6 in the context of the analysis of the nineteenth century lied. The main concern of this discus- sion is the conceptual blend produced by an entire song rather than iso- lated or very general correlations between music and text. The analysis of two settings of Wilhelm Müller’s poem “Trockne Blumen” (from the cycle of poems Die Schöne Müllerin) by Berhard Klein and by Franz Schubert, and of two settings of Joseph von Eichendorff’s poem “In der Fremde” by Robert Schumann and by Johannes Brahms, show how different music interacts with the same text, producing different conceptual blends (in the first case the underlying generic space is the same for the two settings, whereas in the second case each setting is based on a different generic space). Additionally, an analysis of Robert Schumman’s “Im Rhein” (from the song cycle Dichterliebe) shows how “the music makes possible a conceptual blend whose emergent structure includes a narrative considerably more extensive than that of the text alone” (p. 245). At the risk of oversimplification, a taste is given of the analysis of Bernhard Klein’s setting of “Trockne Blumen” (pp. 249–257). The overall discourse set up by the text determines a text space in which a present state of hope- lessness, tears, dying flowers, and so on, gives place to a more optimistic future state that relates to spring, blooming flowers, and hope. This text space is correlated with a musical space of an initial intense and unstable A minor (fully diminished seventh chords, D5 melody ceiling and lack of ca- dences) followed by a goal-oriented and orderly A major (limited chro- maticism, E5 &amp; F   5 ceiling, existence of cadences). The generic space that enables this mapping is that of contrasting ontological states reflected both in text and music. The resultant blended space is that of a song where an initial dark and obsessive present is transformed into an orderly and calm </page> <page sequence="18"> 152 Book Reviews future. The emergent structure of this conceptual blend can be described in terms of the operations of composition, completion, and elaboration. Zbikowski’s accounts of conceptual blending set up exciting analyses of these songs. As the author suggests, seen from the perspective of concep- tual blending, “elements and relations from the mental space set up by the music of a song blend with elements and relations from the mental spaces set up by the text to create a new world for the imagination—a world of supernatural charm, nocturnal terror, and much, much more” (p. 285). Despite the interest of such analyses, the fact is that program music or music such as the nineteenth-century lied are rather not representative of the extremely diverse world of music. It seems to me that conceptual blend- ing would actually have a much broader impact in musical understanding if the input spaces to a conceptual blend and the generic space itself could all be drawn from music proper. Intramusical conceptual blending need not be limited to individual works; it can also take musical styles or idioms as input spaces and produce thus new autonomous musical spaces that can give rise to new musical works. For instance, one could view the Brazilian bossa nova as a conceptual blend between samba and jazz or, in turn, samba as a conceptual blend between African rhythms and European and indigenous music. A musical blend may become emancipated—via the op- eration of elaboration—in such a way that listeners who have grown up within the specific musical culture and period may not even be aware of the initial input spaces. In a sense, the whole evolution of musical styles and idioms may be viewed as a series of conceptual blends. Intramusical concepts are the quintessence of musical meaning; such concepts can de- fine independent musical spaces (such as mental spaces of musical works or styles or idioms) that may give rise to meaningful mappings and con- ceptual blends. ******* Zbikowski’s Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis provides an innovative, sophisticated, and multifaceted account of how cognitive processes, such as categorization, conceptual models, cog- nitive theories, cross-domain mapping, and conceptual blending, play a crucial role in our understanding of music. Such a study not only informs the ways we perceive music and the way we construct our theories about music, but also enriches our understanding of these cognitive processes themselves as music provides a unique domain where such processes may be tested and evaluated. Zbikowski opens up the way for further explora- tion of this extraordinarily rich world of musical concepts and categories.1 Emilios Cambouropoulos Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 1.
