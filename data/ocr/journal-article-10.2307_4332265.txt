<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDWARD TAYLOR'S POETRY: Colonial Baroque By AUSTIN WARREN T O students of poetry, "metaphysical" has become a term al- most as troublesome as "romantic." Once pejorative, it has turned into an adjective of eulogy; but, as before, its scope remains uncertain. Sometimes it appears as an historical term, restricted to a literary movement which became obsolescent about 1650; sometimes it serves as a critical concept for use in the differentia- tion of one poetic "kind" from another. With some critics, meta- physical poetry seems to be synonymous with Donne's, and specif- ically with Donne's Songs and Sonnets, and, in effect, with three or four of them: sometimes it appears a normative definition de- rived from the concluding stanzas of "Valediction Forbidding Mourning"; with other critics, it means (as one of them has been bold enough to say) all 17th Century poetry-presumably that is, before 1660. With some, it means poetry with a discursive or public structure; with others, it includes as well symboliste poetry in which the narrative or logical continuum is chiefly absent and the movement from image to image effected by private association. The term has manifest advantages over such former captions as "cavalier," since (with both Johnson and Eliot) it belongs to literary history and criticism rather than to political history; but it should probably be abandoned for terms and concepts more pre- cise, or defined afresh for each use. For persons who deal in con-</page><page sequence="2">356 KENYON REVIEW tinuities, it is more profitable (since "movements" ordinarily move at the impetus of a first poetic mover) to speak of the "tradition" of Donne, or Pope, or Eliot, if they can remember that two or more "traditions" may meet in the work of a particular poet; for characterization of poets historically near and sharing in some large and general traits we need such a term as "baroque"; finally, and obviously, the work of each poet must be defined in terms of itself, as a unique work. I should like to use "baroque" as a name for such English poetry and prose antedating (at least in its momentum) the neo- classical movement as would, by neo-classical standards, be consid- ered to exemplify "false wit." It subsumes the prose of An- drewes, Burton, and Browne, the poetry of Quarles, Benlowes, Cleveland, Crashaw, and Donne. Its philosophy is Christian and supernaturalist and incarnational, a philosophy which admits of miracle and transcensions of common sense, hence of surprise; its aesthetic, by appropriate consequence, endorses bold figures, ver- bal and imaginal, such figures as the pun, the oxymoron, the par- adox, the metaphor which links events from seemingly alien, dis- continuous spheres. It likes audacious mixtures,-the shepherds and the magi; the colloquial and the erudite. If it provides ecstasies, it allows also of ingenuities: anagrams and acrostics and poems shaped like obelisks or Easter wings. The baroque, in the visual arts and architecture, first identi- fies itself with the Catholic Counter Reformation; and, in poetry as well, it is probably just to think a fully supernatural and sacra- mental conception of the world, a view which holds that miracles still occur in history, to be that philosophy which best validates it. But such a view, if most completely represented by the doctrine and ethos of the Roman Church, is approximately held by High Anglicans, and it is not absent from-but only restricted by- Puritanism and Nonconformity: a supernaturalist treatment of Biblical and apostolic history is common to all 17th Century Chris- tians.</page><page sequence="3">COLONIAL BAROQUE 357 "Metaphysical poetry," if one means by it the poetry of Donne, Carew, and Lord Herbert of Cherbury, is sure to seem an aristocratic poetry; indeed the older designation of "Cavalier" poets is likely to evoke the conception of writers at once Royalist, Anglican, and aristocratic. But certain baroque English poets, notably Herbert and Quarles, won Puritan acceptance, and not alone the acceptance of Puritan gentlefolk-for such there were but of the commonalty: Pope calls Quarles the "plebeians' dar- ling." And a poetic "epic" widely acceptable to Puritans, aristo- crats and bourgeois alike, was The Divine Weeks, Joshua Syl- vester's (1605) translation from the French of a Huguenot noble- man, Guillaume de Saluste du Bartas. Milton was reared on Du Bartas. The curious conceit in the Nativity Ode, written whilst he was still enamored of the "late fantastics," might have come from the fertile pages of the Divine Weeks: So when the Sun in bed Curtain'd with cloudy red Pillows his chin upon an Orient wave . . . Du Bartas assigns ever-procreating Nature to a star-canopied bed- stead: Having therefore the Worlds wide curtain spread About the circuit of the fruitful Bed Where (to fill all with her unnumbered kin) Kind Nature's self each moment lieth-in: To make the same forever admirable More stately-pleasant and more profitable, God th' Azure-Tester trimm'd with golden marks And richly spangled with bright glittering sparks. His usual technique of analogy is not to compare the less to the greater but the greater to the less, domesticating the wildest and grandest objects into familiar properties of the chamber, the hearth, the barnyard. But the trait which most obviously differ- entiates his conceits from those of Donne is their externality:</page><page sequence="4">358 KENYON REVIEW Donne is a psychologist and casuist whose remembered conceits are poetic correlatives for inner states, ultimations to the physical senses of a dialectical movement. Du Bartas's conceits couple dis- junct worlds, -heaven and earth, animate and inanimate, but only superficially, for his heaven is as material and external as his earth, and the images conjoined lie within a single dimension. Fancy, operating upon matter supplied by the memory, has matched counter with counter. The miracle is, at maximum, some Mosaic legerdemain of turning water into blood or turning water into dry land; it is never the Word becoming flesh. With the Restoration of the Stuarts, England moved into a new literary era, of which-according to received genealogy- Jonson was the ancestral representative, Waller and Denham the approximate inaugurators, and Dryden the heroic figure. But the same Restoration effected an isolation of the New England colonies. Politically, theologically, and morally out of sympathy with the age which followed the collapse of their hopes for Eng- land, the colonists of Massachusetts Bay took little interest in the literature which was its product. If, for English literary history, the 17th Century breaks, at about 1660, into contrasting periods, baroque and neoclassical, for American literary history the century constitutes a unit; and the advent of the new mode is delayed till the age of Anne and that of Pope's correspondent and Boston's laureate, Mather Byles. No New England Puritan, one would have said, had the wit for counterparting the conceits of Du Bartas, Quarles, and Herbert: in spite of her contemporary celebration as a "Du Bartas girl," Anne Bradstreet's long "moralities" have nothing in com- mon with the Weekes except their run-on couplets and their pano- ramic scope. But the humbler ingenuities the New Englanders could reproduce. The anagram, with its cognate forms, which Dryden and Addison were to satirize, was a favorite form of cler- ical wit. In attributing this skill to Wilson, first pastor of the Boston Church, Cotton Mather likens it to creation ex nihilo, this</page><page sequence="5">COLONIAL BAROQUE 359 construction of anagrams, in which he made to start Out of mere nothings, by creating art Whole words of counsel; did to motes unfold Names, till they lessons gave richer than gold Equally useful for edification was the pun. Citations of New England wit come most readily from elegies. The chief occasion when the arts might serve piety was the death of some friend, relative, or eminent person. Then a funeral discourse was appropriate; the slatecarver's craft was sum- moned to incise skulls, skeletons, and cherubs; and funeral verse was requisite not only for addition to the memorial slate but, at more ambitious length, for printing as a black-bordered broadside. Despite the youthful Franklin's amusing satire, the New Eng- land Elegy (as written by its experts) was rarely dull. Nothing in the life of a "saint" could be unordained by Providence; and one's name-in its sober normality or anagrammatically rear- ranged-or one's profession, or the disease one fatally suffered from, was each a motif surely not adventitious and therefore apt for adoption by a sincere art. No New England poet possessed the fertility of Cleveland, or of Dryden, whose "Elegy on Lord Hastings" turns to such brilliant account the smallpox from which the noble sufferer perished, but nothing debarred them from com- petition in kind. Thus the Revd. Nicholas Noyes, elegizing his friend, the Revd. Joseph Green, the "green and growing olive tree," devises all proper ethical verdancies; thus the Revd. MT. Capen extendedly analogizes John Foster, deceased printer, to an old almanac which heaven shall revise and to which, revised, God shall add his imprimatur. A more sophisticatedly playful performance, Benjamin Tompson's elegy for Woodmansey, Master of the Boston Latin School, pursues its fancy consistently: in The Grammarian's Funeral, the mourners are not towns, rivers, saints, or poets, but the eight parts of speech, the old schoolmaster's companions and servants.</page><page sequence="6">360 KENYON REVIEW The Clouds of Tears did overcast their faces, Yea all were in most lamentable Cases, The five Declensions did the Work decline, And told the Pronoun Tu, the work is thine: But in this case those have no call to go That want the Vocative, and can't say 0! . . .

But Lego said By me he got his skill, And therefore next the Herse I follow will .... A doleful day for Verbs, they look so moody They drove Spectators to a Mournful Study .... Tompson, the "Renowned Poet of New England" (as his grave- stone celebrated him) wrote no other elegy so sustained in mode as this intellectual divertissement, but he occasionally writes a witty stanza: The Vesper of his life's a constant Cry, When will deaths curious claws these knots untie? A crazie cage of bones curtained with Skin, A Ruind Castle where great strength had beene. That is a jagged and uneven series of which the second and third lines could scarcely have been written out of the 17th Century. Uneven, too, is the poetry of Edward Taylor (1645-1729), recently published for the first time; but more sharply, and far more memorably, is it baroque poetry.' Taylor, who migrated from Warwickshire to Massachusetts in 1668 and graduated from Harvard in 1671, must be accounted not only the best American poet before Bryant but the latest of known poets writing in the baroque style. Taylor has his minor ingenuities; witness, for example, his tributes to Harvard's late president,-his quadruple acrostic whose "trible" is an anagram, "Charles Chauncy - A Call in the l'The Poetical Works of Edward Taylor. Edited (and admirably edit- ed) with an Introduction and Notes by Thomas H. Johnson. Rockland Editions. $6.00.</page><page sequence="7">COLONIAL BAROQUE 361 Churches," while the left-hand initials spell out "President Dyed," and his acrostic chronogram spells out the date of Chauncy's death and his age. Most elaborate in this kind is Taylor's verse letter to his prospective wife, an alphabetic acrostic containing within it a triangle, which in turn encloses a circle. The triangle spells out: "The ring of love my pleasant heart must bee Truly confind within the Trinitie,"-and such, by the equivalence of Triangle and Trinity, the ring is; while the circle translates into "Loves Ring I send that hath no End." These instances of what the century called "shaped verses" are simple extensions of the "emblem," the visualization of a metaphor. In all his poetry, Taylor, though without pretensions to learn- ing or literary allusiveness, is a wit. Like Andrewes and Crashaw, he puns in work of serious intention: "This cur that is so curst"; Christ "died upon the cross to cross out sins." Nor did he neglect the more sophisticated oxymoron, the "dying life and living death," which he might have found in Quarles or the Fletchers. But his chief instrument is the conceit: the conceit homely. The imaginative distance between "tenor" and "vehicle" is, like that in mediaeval mysteries, the distance between philosophical theology and anthropomorphic piety, and again between anthro- pomorphic piety and animism. It is not the hyperbolic or honor- ific use but the domesticating: the shock comes from the modern- ization, the provincializing and localizing of the Infinite, the inno- cently crude exteriorization of the Inner. Taylor's figures for the spiritual life, his constant matter, come from the brewery or the wine-cellar, or from the stalls in the market-place at Coventry, or from weaving, the familiar craft of his native Warwickshire, or from the traffic of sedans and coaches, or from the games played in his youth by the ungodly: Mine Heart's a Park or Chase of Sins: Mine Head's A Bowling Alley: sins play Ninehole here. Phansy's a Green: Sin Barly-breaks in't led. Judgment's a pingle: Blindeman's Buff's plaid there.</page><page sequence="8">362 KENYON REVIEW Taylor's most ambitious piece, God's Determinations, opens with a "preface" in which, like Sylvester and Benlowes, Taylor, reversing the romantic procedure, analogizes nature to the crafts. Who Lac'de and Fillitted the earth so fine, With Rivers like green Ribbons Smaragdine? Who made the Sea's its Selvedge, and it locks Like a Quilt Ball within a Silver Box? Who Spread its Canopy? Or Curtains Spun? Who in this Bowling Alley bowld the Sun? -The obvious comment to make to this kind of writing is that, granted a certain auctorial inventiveness and charmed persistence, it could go on, like Whitman's naturalistic catalogues, without any reason for stopping: a poem from which no part was dis- pensable could not thus be constructed. Beyond that, one sees that, within the general mode of "nature -- the artificed," the poet feels no responsibility to arrange his tropes: they go outdoors, indoors, into my lady's chamber, into her wardrobe without plan- ned movement of parallelism or contrast; each is a disjunct com- parison. And from this absence of more than most general pattern, one sees the poet is scarcely conscious of his pattern's implications. What they are is clear: God, in creating the earth, did not operate like an architect whose responsibility limited itself to blueprints, or like a Newtonian Engineer calculating masses and thrusts and pressures: he worked out his designs with the same manual detail with which a dressmaker puts together a dress or a carpenter makes a box. But the poet seems unaware how far his aesthetic refers back to his theology, and so certain of what he is trying, in words, to do. This "preface" is not unfairly characteristic of what follows, a long poem partly in the set dialogue of the moralities, partly in lyric strophes. Its modest but indubitable success is in its logic, still more in its psychology. Taylor-even by reference to Ductor Dubitantium and Treatise on the Religious Affections-is a re- spectable, a sensitive casuist.</page><page sequence="9">COLONIAL BAROQUE 363 After a preluding dialogue between Justice and Mercy, Tay- lor briefly represents the rebellion, from Satan's army, of the elect; and then the drama-an inner drama-begins. Satan is furious at defection from his ranks, and begins a series of dialectic onslaughts calculated to weaken the morale of the recusants. The converts are divided into three "ranks" or categories; and Satan addresses himself in turn, with psychiatric shrewdness, to the sit- uation of each. As in Herbert's "The Collar," the subtle argu- mentation is entirely directed against the reality of the religious experience. It is precarious to represent God as a dialectician; and Taylor has the modest advantage over Milton of not making his God a "school-divine." Satan argues; Christ replies with the simple affection of a father. Satan tries all the ambiguities: sin is too slight to bother about, too gross for God to forgive; Grace is "but an airy notion or a name"; doubtful phantasms are the existence of God, of Heaven and of Hell. But Taylor reserves his subtler analysis for the dialogues between the soul of the con- vert and the "saint," the more experienced Christian, who knows the sophistries of Satan and the growing pains of the regenerate. The Soul suffers from scrupulosities: it fears that only fear of Hell, not love of God, motivates it; it fears "under each Duty done, Hypocrisy"; it is troubled by the philosophical objection that the Christian God is but "a Heape of Contradictions high"; it is disturbed by the misconduct of professed Christians. Finally the saint succeeds in reassuring the novice that the devout life is struggle and gradual progress; and the piece ends with seven lyrics expressive of spiritual triumph and rapture. It is character- istic of Taylor's nature (as seen everywhere in his poetry) that the drama concerns itself with the souls of the elect: this Puritan nowhere contemplates the situation of the damned or touches his lips to the minatory trumpet. The problem of the "long poem" presents itself all simply to Taylor. He probably never saw Paradise Lost, published the year before he left England; his instances would be The Divine</page><page sequence="10">364 KENYON REVIEW Weekes, Christ's Victory and The Purple Island, Anne Bradstreet's Four Elenments. Within his scope were the sustained allegory of Phineas Fletcher or the graceful Spenserian texture of Giles, or the simple unfigured, unpretentious Tudor verse of the Tenth Muse. He chose none. The piece suggests drama, but there is no attempt at adjusting speech to speaker. Spenser and Milton and the epic style make none either; but then there is a style to be established which is consistent in its elegance or opulence. The concettist method, so admirably suited either to the lyric, which it provides with initial structure, or to the short piece, satiric or elegiac, in which constant metaphoric explosion can operate brilliantly within a simple logical or narrative frame, is ill suited to the continuum of the epic or the dramatic. Taylor did not attempt it as seriously as did Du Bartas. Only the lyrics within Determinations have tolerable poetic success: the dialogue and narrative oscillate un- steadily between unreconciled manners in a fashion which would have been intolerable to Giles Fletcher. Without adjustment, the style is now rhetorical or juristic, now colloquial; the diction now theologic, now provincial: Taylor, unaware of the stratifications in his vocabulary, does not know how to expose them with intent and for an effect. And his handling of the trope has equal un- certainty. The "Effects of Mans Apostacy," the opening section, begins with an extended if not very amazing conceit of sin storm- ing the fortress of the heart. This is pursued, with tolerable appli- cation, for something like thirty lines, then dropped for straight narrative. There follows a Dantean simile (quite alien in tone and technique): Then like a Child that fears the Poker Clapp Him on his face doth on his Mothers lap Doth hold his breath, lies still for fear least hee Should by his breathing lowd discover'd bee.... And, in the following lines, we are unpreparedly back to the con- ceit of the heart as fort; and then we drop the conceit entirely. It is not merely the case of an unrelated simile within a conceit:</page><page sequence="11">COLONIAL BAROQUE 365 it is the shattering effect upon the conventional conceit of the realistic and humanly touching simile; and it is the nonchalance with which the conceit is adopted, dropped, abrogated, resumed, dropped. Taylor is seen to better advantage in his lyrics, within and without the Determinations. Between 1682 and 1715, he com- posed over two hundred "Sacramental Meditations" (of which Johnson's selection prints thirty-one). It was the poet's custom to celebrate the Lord's Supper about five times a year, and to write for each observance a poem based upon some passage of Scripture: though the majority of the texts are Evangelical, more than seven- ty come from the Song of Songs, which Taylor, following the traditional practise of Christendom and the specific example of Quarles in the Fourth Book of his Emblems, interprets allegoric- ally. A better than average example of his lyrics is "Meditation Eight," from the Johannine hint, "I am the living bread." I kenning through Astronomy Divine The Worlds bright Battlement, wherein I spy A Golden Path my Pensill cannot line From that bright Throne vnto my Threshold ly. And while my puzzled thoughts about it pore I finde the Bread of Life in't at my doore. When that this Bird of Paradise put in This Wicker Cage (my corps) to tweedle praise Had peckt the fruite forbid: and so did fling Away its Food, and lost its golden dayes, It fell into Celestiall Famine sore, And never could attain a morsell more. Alas! alas! Poore Bird, what wilt thou doe? This Creatures field no food for Souls e're gave. And if thou knock at Angells dores, they show An Empty Barrell: they no soul bread have. Alas! Poore Bird, the Worlds White Loafe is done, And cannot yield thee here the smallest Crumb.</page><page sequence="12">366 KENYON REVIEW In this sad state, Gods Tender Bowells run Out streams of Grace: And he to end all strife, The Purest Wheate in Heaven, his deare-dear Son Grinds, and kneads vp into this Bread of Life. Which Bread of Life from Heaven down came and stands Disht in thy Table vp by Angells Hands. Did God mould vp this Bread in Heaven, and bake, Which from his Table came, and to thine goeth? Doth he bespeake thee thus: TIis Soule Bread take; Come, Eate thy fill of this, thy Gods White Loafe? Its Food too fine for Angells; yet come, take And Eate thy fill! Its Heavens Sugar Cake. What Grace is this knead in this Loafe? This thing Souls are but petty things it to admire. Yee Angells, help: This fill would to the brim Heav'ns whelm'd-down Chrystall meele Bowle, yea and higher. This Bread of Life dropt in thy mouth doth Cry: Eate, Eate me, Soul, and thou shalt never dy. Taylor's curious coupling of thing and brim, matched in other poems, shows not only that he did not sound terminal g but that he accounted nasals a satisfactory rhyme; and elsewhere he allows himself loose consonances and assonances in rhyme's stead. These latitudes take share with his Warwickshire provincialisms, his downright coinages, his inversions and other awkward, sometimes unconstruable, syntax (like that in the opening stanza of this poem) in giving to this poem (and Taylor's other poems) a primitive vigor and a naivete which are irrelevant to the baroque aesthetic and which are unmatched in other "metaphysical" verse of the period. Donne's celebrated prosody in the Satires, like that of other free writers of pentameter iambics, provides its approximate pat- tern by offering, in a line, either five strong stresses, without cal- culation of weak syllables, or ten syllables, without calculation of stresses, trusting that the two latitudes will balance to a conver- sational verse. But Taylor, though he had an iambic rhythm in</page><page sequence="13">COLONIAL BAROQUE 367 his memory, seems chiefly to have counted the syllables; and his characteristic practice is to write a line slowed up by its extra stresses. "They no soul bread have" requires an equal weight to each syllable. The line of monosyllables, "What Grace is this knead in this Loafe? This thing," breaks down in the middle if one attempts to scan it as iambics. To it, as to the "Soul bread," the spondaic reading seems alone adept. As with other poets, ancient and contemporary, who reduce the flexible music of their rhythms, Taylor compensates by supplying (as in this instance) rather copious alliteration,-alliteration not as structure but as pure and simple phonetic pleasure. The stiffness of Taylor's lines must not be attributed merely to prosodic awkwardness. Unquestionably he relished a packed line: like greater poets, Donne, Hopkins, and Crane, he was im- patient of space given to prepositions and articles and other poetic neutralities. Taylor's "Heaven's whelm'd down-Chrystall meele Bowle" is less rare in kind for him than, for George Herbert, is the "Christ-side-piercing Spear" of "Prayer." The force of the poem, which in spite of its inversions seems modern, is the consequence of its compression, its density. The thrice-used phrase, "Soul bread," has only to be compared with its expanded "bread for the soul" to exhibit its advantage. Com- pacted, too, is "celestiall famine," which is not an oxymoron but equivalent to "a famine of celestial food." But its chief character is (to use an intentionally cautious word) its metaphorism. Taylor is capable, one sees from "The Ebb and Flow" and "Huswifery," of working out, neatly and precisely, a conceit: the latter poem tidily analogizes the Christian life to all the instruments and processes of clothmaking,-the spinning-wheel, the distaff, the reel, the loom, the web, the fulling mills, till the robes of salvation are ready for the pious wearing. Such poems, better called short allegories than extended conceits, are, however, less typical of Taylor and poetically less impressive than the poem in hand, of which the method, more bold, is less surely prosecuted.</page><page sequence="14">368 KENYON REVIEW "Meditation Eight" has the advantage of putting its two best stanzas last. Scrutinized in detail, one sees that Taylor begins uncertain of direction and with trite locutions (like "golden path" and "bright Throne"), locutions bad exactly in the wrong way for baroque poetry. Then the "bird" figure occurs to him: the soul is bird of Paradise in a double sense,-child of heaven and heir of Eden's Adam, who was put in the "cage" of the Garden as the Soul has been put into that of the Body, to sing God's praises, but who (like his descendant soul) has instead eaten of the for- bidden fruit. Taylor manages this equivalence neatly for three lines: the wicker cage can well stand for the tree-shaded garden; peckt properly modifies bird as well as man. But after that he has his difficulties: while, for a stanza more, evoking the soul as bird, he has really ceased thinking in terms of the figure, without knowing how to return to the narrative "I" of the first stanza; and, before he shapes the "I" into a "thou," he takes in transit a Scriptural enough figure of God's running bowels which, however Scriptural, is too strong a trope to be thrust, briefly, and unsig- nificantly, into a poem with its own central boldness. "To end all Strife" seems pure aid to the rhyme, since (though there is famine) no conflict has been mentioned. Then, happily, Taylor finds his tone and theme, already sounded (under the accidental protection of the "bird") in the third stanza; the translation of Supersubstantial Bread, the Panis Angelicus, into domestic and animistic terms. Even in the last stanzas, the method is too liber- tine for Donne or Herbert; but the devices associate themselves, in baroque fashion, about surprises,-surprises of bearing down with a poet's literalness upon the propositions that Christ is the Bread (therefore Christ was ground and Kneaded up) and Bread is bread (therefore subject to all the accidents and comparisons to which bread is subject). The total effect of the poem is amateurish but (by virtue of persistent episodic interest and a nuclear theme most efficiently demonstrated as the poem nears its end) powerful. "The Reflextion," upon the text, "I am the rose of Sharon,"</page><page sequence="15">COLONIAL BAROQUE 369 is a brilliant piece in which, after Taylor's frequent fashion, each stanza is allotted its own conceit, while the textual image, the rose, appears and reappears. Once at thy Feast, I saw thee Pearle-like stand 'Tween Heaven and Earth, where Heavens Bright glory all In streams fell on thee, as a floodgate and Like Sun Beams through thee on the World to Fall. Oh! Sugar sweet then! My Deare sweet Lord, I see Saints Heaven-lost Happiness restor'd by thee. Shall Heaven and Earth's bright Glory all up lie, Like Sun Beams bundled in the sun in thee? Dost thou sit Rose at Table Head, where I Do sit, and Carv'st no morsell Sweet for mee? So much before, so little now! Sprindge, Lord, Thy Rosie Leaves, and me their Glee afford. Christ, as the Rose, offers his sacramental presence: he sits Rose at Table Head, and carves a morsel of what is at once meat, bread, flower, and supreme value. Sometimes we can visualize Taylor's conceit, after the fashion of an Italian or Flemish primitive, in two or three strong colors against a flat gold background, or of a 17th Century "emblem," an engraving which literally translates into graphic terms a literary figure: so one can read the Pearl, through which sunbeams stream down upon a terrestrial globe; so one can read the opening of another poem of Taylor's, a 'song of innocence': My shattred Phancy stole away from mee (Wits run a Wooling over Edens Parke) And in Gods Garden saw a golden Tree, Whose Heart was All Divine, and gold its barke: Whose glorious limbs and fruitfull branches strong With Saints and Angells bright are richly hung. But "Dost thou sit Rose" is more complex: it at once invites and repels visualization. Exciting by its compression, it is, and is not, connected with the figures which precede and follow it. Is the pre- ceding "thee," compact with bright glories, the anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="16">370 KENYON REVIEW figure of Christ, or Christ as the Rose? Whichever, it is difficult not to avoid a connotative overlapping of Christ, the Rose, and the Sun of Righteousness: "In the sun in thee" consists of two disjunct phrases, one of which goes with "bundled," the other with "lie," but juxtaposed as they are one takes "thee" also as appositive of "sun." And then in the last couplet, have we left the Table for the Garden? The answer has to be indecisive, for the rosie leaves equate the sweet morsels of the sacred feast, yet the figure of distribution takes a new and garden turn: sprindge, spread, your leaves, and spreading them share with me their Glee. The last word perhaps draws us indoors again: their Glee, their joy, mirth, music. The "rosy leaves" must be the petals: the rose is to open, tendering its petals and their glee, which is perhaps first their equivalence of music, their "sugar sweet" fragrance, then their spiritual delight, their mystical joy. Thus to "open out" the stanza is to show Taylor's fancy moving playfully in a mode nearer to symbolisme than to the logical prosecution of a conceit. Something like seven of Taylor's poems have whole virtue; of the others, there are few without a signal stanza or a brilliant line. The work is very uneven; exciting to look into, disappointing to read with consecutive patience. The equivalent can be said of Theophila's Edward Benlowes, of Du Bartas and his translator, Sylvester. Concettist poetry is never simply commonplace. Bad classical poetry is worn, threadbare, insipid; bad baroque poetry is either a succession of labored ingenuities or a series of uncon- trolled conflagrations, spasmodic eruptions, meaningless violences: its worst is a kind of coldly calculated fury. Taylor is sometimes a neat little artisan, but more often an unsteady enthusiast, a naive original, an intermittently inspired Primitive. He is rarely un- interesting, on some level; but his taste-and there is a baroque taste as well as a classical-is unschooled, unsteady. Even Cleve- land has taste-of a highly spiced and savory sort: he moves at the pitch of keen intellectual vaudeville; he is a kind of erudite</page><page sequence="17">COLONIAL BAROQUE 371 version of the New Yorker's poets. But Taylor is nearer to being an ancestor of another uneven village poet, Emily Dickinson. He lacks her self-consciousness with ingredient coyness, and cuteness, but he has his equivalent vices, the defects of unself-consciousness. Of the poets whom Taylor invokes as companions in one respect or another,-Crashaw, Blake, Dickinson, Hopkins, Crane, -all are greater and all are superior in the frequency of their successes. But it is enough to say of Taylor that, like the others, he is at worst a poet and not a metrical proseman.</page></plain_text>
