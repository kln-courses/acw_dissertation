<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THEOLOGY OF EXODUS 32-34 MESHULLAM MARGALIOT 1. Preface The theology of Ex 32-34 is essentially covenant theology. It constitutes a fundamental component within the larger system of OT theology. Nevertheless, this unit has not been treated adequately by most modern OT theologians except by Eichrodt. Very few commentaries deal with these three chapters as a closed, self-contained, monolithic composition. Here the important traditional commentary of Benno Jacob on Exodus (1943, unpublished, microfilm) is to be mentioned, and the book of R.W.L. Moberly "At the Mountain of God - Story and Theology of Exodus 32-34" (1983). Both of them deal with the critical attitude to this unit from different angles, but arrived at quite similar conclusions. It so appears that Moberly did not know of Jacob's commentary, as he does not mention it at all. Basing ourselves on their methods and some of their results, this article will deal with some major theological issues of this important composition. 2. 32:7-14: Moses' Argument of the LORD'S Divinity This passage reveals a basic change in the relationship between the LORD and Moses. So far, Moses had acted mainly as the LORD'S representative in the exodus and as mediator in the Sinai Covenant. Because of the new situation created by the transgression of the people, Moses became their paraklet before the LORD, trying to save them from his harsh but just verdict to destroy them. It so appears as if the LORD somehow relinquished his decision, ready to recognize Moses as an almost equal partner after he had taken upon himself the task of their paraklet. This change in their mutual relationship proves to be of major consequence in the subsequent theological development of the narrative. The argumentation of Moses is quite extraordinary: it is pure theology. He does not directly ask the LORD for forgiveness. His paraklesis is based on the very likely reaction of the Egyptians to the divine image of the LORD: 'He brought his people out of Egypt so as to destroy them altogether in the wilderness! For this very reason you must reconsider your verdict - the more so as even your oath to the patriarchs is here involved as well.' In short, 43</page><page sequence="2">MESHULLAM MARGALIOT 'your very divinity, your recognition as a God by other nations and Israel is here most seriously endangered.' It is as if Moses intercedes as the representative of Israel for the sake of the LORD'S divinity - certainly a paradoxical theological situation. Moreover, it is as if the strength of this argument almost forced the LORD to reconsider his verdict. 3. Paraklesis as an Essential Feature of the LORD in OT Theology Contrary to prevalent opinion, the LORD does not wish to act in his relation to mankind as an absolute, autocratic ruler, In the OT, at least, he is looking for a person ready to take upon himself the task of establishing the LORD'S divinity among his fellow-men, Israelite and of other nations, to propagate among them his teachings, and their belief in him. In the OT there are at least four individuals, living at various times within different historic and religious situations who acted as paraklets: Abraham, Moses, Samuel and Jeremiah. All these four were prophets. Abraham and Moses were the greater ones in their prophetic stature. Both of them became quasi-councellors of the divine council, which meant that the LORD asked their opinion, even advice, before he made his final decision about human beings to be punished by destruction. It was Abraham before the LORD decided about the fate of Sodom (Gen 18:17 33), and Moses when the LORD wanted to destroy his own people (here, and again in Num 14, when the whole people rebelled against him). Both of them interceded, and their plea was accepted by the LORD (in Num 14 at least partially). Such cases of paraklesis were possible only after the servant himself had become a partner of the covenant, and had been granted in that position the status and privilege of a divine councellor. Abraham's advice was asked for by the LORD (in Gen 18) after his covenant with him (in Gen 17); that of Moses in Ex 32:1 If. only after the Sinaitic Covenant in Ex 19-24. However, this type of paraklet is limited to early, pre-classical prophecy. In classical prophecy, the only one mentioned was Jeremiah, but his attempt at paraklesis was denied by the LORD, because the sin of the people had already reached such a degree that even prophetic intercession would not change the final verdict and outcome (Jer 15:1-4 mentioning both Moses and Samuel; 2 Kings 23:26-27). Moses was the most outstanding of these four. In this narrative, he decisively influenced its whole development and outcome by his paraklesis, finally enabling the re-establishment of the broken covenant. The theological aspect that emerges is that human paraklesis is an essential feature of the LORD'S divinity. It so appears that he is looking for a human paraklet, even for a divine human partnership in establishing his divine rule among Israel, and finally by means of Israel among the whole of mankind (Ex 19:4-6). Accepting, even desiring human intervention by paraklesis into a primarily exclusive divine realm must therefore be considered as a characteristic feature of the LORD ('encouraging active involvement of human action within the divine plan of history'). 44</page><page sequence="3">THE THEOLOGY OF EXODUS 32-34 4. 33:11; "Face to Fare" "The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another." This sentence is of major theological importance for the understanding of the whole unit. It is located exactly at its centre, expressing one of its main themes: the LORD and Moses spoke to each other on a common basis, in spite of the vast, essentially unbridgeable, because existential, chasm between them: between the eternal, transcendental God and the mortal, earthbound human being, between the creator and the created. Only once a true dialogue between them became possible because the LORD initiated it on these terms. Its importance is characterized by its subject: how far man can know God. The problem appears, as generally in the OT, within a certain historical and religious context: within the present situation of the Israelites, who, after having broken their covenant with the LORD, but having repented, somehow expected the LORD to renew his relations with them. The dialogue concentrates upon that quintessential question: how far can a human being know the LORD, understand the way he acts? How far can he make out, anticipate, his reactions) in a given situation? Can he attain at all an exact, correct, definable concept of the LORD even by means of the knowledge of his attributes? For these reasons, this opening sentence must be considered as a key to the subsequent dialogue. Moses appears in it as an almost equal partner of the LORD in their common endeavour and final goal to bring about the LORD'S forgiveness to the people's transgression, re-establishing the covenant between them. The quasi-equality of the LORD and Moses in this dialogue is brought out by several literary devices. 1) The main dialogue contains two short paragraphs of equal length (w. 12-16; 17-23). Their construction follows an identical pattern. In the first, Moses speaks, and the LORD'S answer is stated in four words. The second is built in parallel fashion. The LORD speaks, and Moses' request is stated in exactly four words. 2) Another device: the dialogue here contains 24 'I - You' and 'You - I' words and phrases: 12 :הודעתני - ידעתיך - הראני וכוי; אתה אמר אלי - מצאתי חן בעינך - תשלח עמי וכוי of them in the first part, 12 in the second part. 3) A third device: the words 'I/You' and 'You/I'אני - אתה; אתה - אני/אנכי appear altogether ten times: 5 times T, 5 times 'You'; 5 in the LORD'S speeches, 5 in Moses' speeches. The importance to be attached to the almost visual confrontation between Moses and the LORD who appears to him as a person, displaying a definite personality of his own, is this: the face of man somehow confronts the face of the LORD. The personality of the one somehow reflects the personality of the other. Thus the anthropomorphic revelation quite paradoxically is likely to deepen the religious consciousness of man. After all, a god characterized by an Aristotelian first principle or first mover, or an abstract god of Neo-platonic negative qualities, about whom nothing positive can be predicated - 45</page><page sequence="4">MESHULLAM MARGALiOT such gods can never become objects of veneration, even less of prayer, to man: he just cannot establish personal relations with them. 5. 33:19-23: The Revelation to Moses In v. 18, Moses had asked the LORD to be permitted to see his glory, here another term for his face, continuing "face to face" of v. 11. This was a very audacious request. "To see the LORD'S face" is to be equated with an intimate knowledge of his personality, the way a person looks at the face of his fellow-man, enabling him to know to a large extent his thoughts and intentions. The LORD'S answer is quite complex, divided into three separate speeches (vv. 19, 20, 21-23), preparing Moses for the subsequent revelation of the divine attributes. In v. 19a Moses is granted the revelation of the LORD'S name, synonymous with his attributes, his essential features. "All my goodness" is here used as a comprehensive term for both series of attributes, of compassion as well as of punishment in 34:6-7. V. 19b however states that there is a certain limitation inherent in them (see next paragraph). In the second speech (v. 20), the LORD firmly refuses to fully grant Moses' request: the full sight (= knowledge) of the LORD is absolutely impossible for man, being simply beyond human capacity. (In modern terms: it would destroy the divinity of the LORD, it would degrade him altogether to the level of a human being. A God who can entirely be rationalized would be no God any more). The third speech (vv. 21-23): Nevertheless, the LORD will grant to Moses, as a special privilege to him only, a partially visual, unique revelation: he will be permitted to look at his disappearing glory, but not at the glory itself. The LORD concludes his answer by restating that an intimate knowledge of the LORD cannot be attained by a human being; thus stressing once again the essentially existential difference between the LORD and man. The reason of the paradoxical description in vv. 21-23, in which the LORD himself had to protect Moses from the revelation of his own glory, is to emphasize that the LORD enabled Moses to look at his glory at the highest possible level for a human being. Thus w. 21-23 explain not only v. 20, but also v. 19: Moses will be able to receive the divine revelation (in 34:6-7) by means of the meaning of the divine name, to be expressed by his attributes. Thus v. 19 prepares exactly the correct theological interpretation of 34:6-7. 6. 33:19a: Terms about the LORD: Face - Name - Glorv - Goodness These terms appear in the dialogue; all of them are said by the LORD about himself. There are several possibilities to interpret them: 1) as divine hypostases; 2) terms somehow trying "to express the inexpressible, the experience of God" (Moberly p. 76); 3) as divine features, aspects or attributes. As to (1): They cannot be regarded as hypostases, as they do not act on their own, independently of the LORD. As to (2): Existential terms are hardly to be expected in a theological dialogue stressing the equality between the LORD and Moses, preparing for the revelation of divine attributes, necessarily to be expressed in human terms. Moreover, all these terms can be quite exactly defined (see e.g. Ps 25:4-11; 27:4, 11,13). As to (3): It so appears that these terms convey divine features or aspects ('attributes' to be reserved for 34:6-7) which can be clarified easily within theological contexts. For 'goodness', 46</page><page sequence="5">THE THEOLOGY OF EXODUS 32-34 see Ps 25:7, 27:13, and 145:7, and then Is 63:7, where it is paralleled with 'compassion' and 'grace'. However, a remarkable difference is that "all my goodness" is here equated with all attributes to be revealed, including those threatening punishment (the last two). It seems that the LORD, speaking in this dialogue to Moses, and finally to the whole of Israel, uses these terms intentionally so as to appear to man more 'human', more open to human understanding. Thus his image becomes even more anthropomorphic; thus "face to face" becomes here almost a very personal reality. It has to be remembered that the final addressees were the whole Israelite people, the learned person as well as the average one, at that time and for future generations. 7. 33:19b: וחנתי את אשר אחן / ורחמתי את אשר ארחם Compare the following translations: LXX: kai eleesö hon an eleö, kai oiktiresö hon an oiktirö. Vulgata: et miserebor cui voluero, et Clemens ero in quem mihi placuerit. Luther: wem ich gnaedig bin, dem bin ich gnaedig. KJV, NEB, New JPS: I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. Buber - Rosenzweig: Dass ich goenne, wem ich goenne. Schreiber: Ich begnade, den ich begnaden will. (= H. Schreiber, Tora, in: Die heilige Schrift, Frankfurt a/M 1934) JB: I have compassion on whom I will, and I show pity to whom I please. This is definitely not an idem per idem construction although it so appears to most commentators. In this context, such a meaning does not make sense. It is theologically as well as logically tautological. Now this statement prepares the correct interpretation of the divine attributes "... a God compassionate and gracious, etc." in 34:6-7. As original *yaqtulu / *yaqtula / *yaqtul became * yaqtul and then yiqtol (R. Meyer, Hebr. Grammatik, 1969, § 63.3), the sense must be: I shall be gracious to whom I will be gracious, etc. This meaning makes here excellent sense, explaining the application of the divine attributes 'gracious' and 'compassionate'. Therefore the correct translation, already found in the LXX and Vulgata, is that of Schreiber and the JB. Likewise, all other attributes are to be understood thus. This meaning intends to prevent a serious misunderstanding: the LORD is not always compassionate and gracious. He will always make his decision dependent on the specific person and case, like a righteous judge. It means that the LORD is entirely sovereign, absolutely independent of man. Man cannot know his decision beforehand; moreover, he is in no position whatsoever to influence his decision. This may appear today almost self-evident, but it was not always so in the ANE. In Egypt as well as in Mesopotamia, man-made gods were often exposed to pressures of man, or at least of other gods according to their mythologies. Therefore this statement of the LORD about himself constitutes a theologoumenon of the first order. This absolute autonomy, independence and sovereignty sets the LORD apart from all other ANE gods. It must be considered a revolutionary statement from the theological point of view, and certainly so in the history of ANE theology. 47</page><page sequence="6">MESHULLAM MARGALIOT However, the scope of וחנוני וגוי is even more comprehensive than just indicated. Let us look again at its syntax: "I shall be gracious to whom I will be gracious." By a small textual change, without changing the meaning, the following sentence results: אחן את אשר אחן / וארחם את אשר ארחם. Now this structure has an interesting and very famous parallel in Ex 3:14: אהיה אשר אהיה - intimately connected with the revelation and meaning of the divine name Y-H-W-H (the tetragrammaton). Thus we are able to arrive at the correct meaning of this much discussed phrase, but only when taking into account its context. After the LORD had told Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, Moses asked (3:11): "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?" The LORD'S answer: "I shall be with you" ויאמר כי אהיה עמך . Thereupon Moses continued to ask: "When I come to the Israelites and say to them 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and they ask me 'What is his name?', what shall I say to them?" The LORD's famous answer: אהיה אשר אהיה "I shall be with you when I will be with you." In other words: the LORD is unwilling to back Moses unconditionally in his task - that is what Moses actually demanded. The LORD's support will only be conditional: only if Moses performs his mission according to the LORD's instructions. Now 33:19b וחנתי וגוי expresses essentially the same idea as אהיה אשר אהיה. The basic theological concepts here and there are entirely identical. This identity should not be regarded as a surprise. 33:12 (ידעתיך בשם(=בשמי refers back to ch. 3, and so does 33:17 (ואדעך בשם (בשמי: it stands to reason that 33:19 is an elaboration of 3:14, applied here to a real situation in life ('Sitz im Leben'). Therefore it ought not to be different from the first self-revelation of the divine name in ch. 3. 8. The Meaning of the Divine Name *Y.' (the tetragrammaton! Last not least: The result thus obtained can now be generalized. The exact meaning of the divine name 'Y.' (the tetragrammaton) is that of 'the God who is with man', אהיה עמך "I shall be with you" (3:12), but only on the condition that that person's entreaty or prayer deserves to be answered by him, that his actions and intentions are approved by him. This condition is clearly implied in 3:14) אהיה אשר אהיה), according to the explanation obtained from 33:19) וחנתי את אשר אחן). This then is exactly the meaning of the divine name 'Y.' according to 3:13-15: מה שמו... אהיה אשר אהיה... זה שמי לעלם. In the case of Moses (Ex 3): that he carries out his assigned task as commanded by him; in the case of the Israelites (Ex 33): that they wholeheartedly repent so as to renew their covenant with the LORD. 9. 34:6-7: The Number of Divine Attributes This subject is not discussed at all by Moberly 0983), nor by Childs 0974). But it was already dealt with by Cassuto in his commentary on Exodus (1952, ET 1967). He counted 7 attributes, 5 of compassion and 2 of punishment, without quoting any sources. The point is that the former outweigh by far the latter: the LORD is essentially a God of compassion, but not of compassion only. The attributes of punishment are likewise inherent in his divine personality as a just judge of man. 48</page><page sequence="7">THE THEOLOGY OF EXODUS 32-34 These attributes are stated here within the covenant of the LORD with Israel, but appear to apply to all human beings. In the Book of Jonah they expressly include all nations (4:2b based on Ex 34:6), considered as basic attributes of the LORD. The formula here is the standard one, quoted (or at least parts of it) by most later authors. Quotations from Ex 20:5-6 are less frequent. The number of 13 attributes originating in the Jewish exegetical tradition (b. Rosh Hashanah 17b) is rather late. It is not known how the Sages arrived at that number; almost all Jewish medieval and modern commentaries deal with this problem. 10. 34:6-7: "The LORD, the LORD ..." "... הי I הי" The two divine names "Y., Y. ..." (the tetragrammaton) preceding the seven divine attributes constitute an exegetical as well as a theological problem, but not a textual one (cf. Gen 22:11, Ex 3:4). They are not a noun clause ('The LORD is the LORD'); an idem per idem would also here make no sense. Nor are they vocative, Moses calling the name of the LORD, nor 'The LORD passed before him, and the LORD proclaimed 'A God compassionate etc."; nor is the text to be corrected because of the LXX or even Num 14:18 which read only one divine name. Any quasi-philosophical meaning read into them would be eisegesis, not exegesis. The meaning of these two syntactically unconnected divine names seems to be this: the God who is compassionate and gracious etc. is the same God who does not remit punishment. These two consecutive divine names thus indicate that there exists no division within his divinity. The assumption of an internal division within the godhead could easily lead to the hypothesis of two separate, opposite divine powers, then even of two gods opposing each other - a development and situation well known in ANE myuthologies, likewise in the phenomenology and history of religion, leading finally to dualistic religious systems like those of Zoroaster, later gnostic systems as e.g. of Markion, Mani, and many more. The anthropomorphic OT revelation demanded a formula preserving absolute unity of the LORD. This was effected by the simple literary device of putting two consecutive, syntactically unconnected divine names before the two apparently opposed series of divine attributes. 11. 34:14: "El Oanna'" - The Imnassioned God: The Balance in the Attributes of the LORD The balance - or, to be more exact, the lack of balance - between the two series of divine attributes in 34:6-7 is certainly meaningful, if only for the reason that the first series only is often quoted, or at least parts of it. Having read these attributes, the Israelite might conclude that the LORD is altogether far more a compassionate God than one who metes out punishment - and thereupon would act accordingly, always expecting, in spite of his transgressions, the LORD to react leniently. Therefore the LORD adds, not far after those attributes (v. 14)כי ה' קנא שמו / אל קנא היא "... because the LORD, whose name is the Impassioned one, is an impassioned God." This statement somehow rectifies the lack of balance of those attributes; the more so as it had already appeared (also as a self-revelation) within the ten commandments as one of his essential attributes, preceding there the series of requiting attributes: 'כי אנכי ה אלהיך אל קנא פקד עון אבות על בנים "... for I the LORD your God am an impassioned God, 49</page><page sequence="8">MESHULLAM MARGALIOT visiting the guilt of the fathers upon the(ir) children etc." Therefore the statement of the LORD as an 'impassioned God' (here in v. 14) ought to be regarded as a necessary theological complement to his predominant attributes of mercy in w. 6-7. 12. 34:11-26: The Repetition of the Commandments This passage should be considered as an integral part of the Golden Calf narrative. The repetition of the commandments from the so-called 'Book of Covenant' (23:12-33) was imperative because the broken covenant was to be renewed on these conditions only. The hypothesis of 10 or 12 'ritual' commandments (attributed to J), more primitive and more ancient than the 10 'ethical' ones in ch. 20 (attributed to E), to be regarded as parallels, does not recommend itself. It does not take into account the necessity of this passage in its present context. Compared with the 'Book of Covenant', it exactly reflects the changes caused by the new situation by means of emphases, repetitions, omissions and additions. 13. 34:27-35: "The Radiant Skin of Moses'Face" כי סרן עור פני משה It was caused by Moses meeting the LORD 'face to face' (v. 29). 'The radiant face of Moses' could not be written lest he might have been believed a human being having become divine, or even a god, not uncommon in the ANE, which was of course to be avoided. V. 29: "Moses was not aware that the skin of his face was radiant.ומשה לא ידע כי " קרן עור פניו בדברו אתו This is the seventh and last time that the very important key-word ידע appears in this narrative. Its main theme (as already stated) is the human quest for the knowledge of the LORD. The only one in this narrative who might have attained a full knowledge is Moses. Did he finally obtain it? Here is the answer: If he was not aware of the radiance of his own face after having talked with the LORD - how could he ever have obtained it? This, of course, is a major theological point. Therefore the surprise of Aaron and the people, and of course of Moses himself (v. 30b), is here described at some length (w. 29b-32). V. 32b: "... he instructed them (the Israelites) concerning all that the LORD had imparted to him on Mount Sinai." There were no 'secrets' which Moses kept to himself. All he had received from the LORD he told the people. This narrative therefore claims to contain the full report of the dialogue between them, including the revelation of the divine attributes. The elevation of Moses' status in Israel somehow corresponds to the elevation of the LORD'S status in their midst. In this narrative, containing fundamentals of OT theology, God and man somehow meet on a more common and intimate level than anywhere else in the OT. 50</page></plain_text>
