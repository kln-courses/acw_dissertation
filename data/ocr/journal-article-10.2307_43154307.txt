<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS VOL. 27, NO. 1, SPRING 1999 Nonhuman Minds Donald R. Griffin Harvard University A significant component of the philosophical problem of other minds is the question whether consciousness is a uniquely human attribute, or whether members of other species experience thoughts or feelings of any kind - and, if so, what these are like to the animals themselves. The aim of this paper is to review recent and relevant developments in the scientific investigation of animal cognition that provide small but nevertheless significant steps toward answering Thomas Nagel's famous question "What is it like to be a bat (or other animal)?"1 Insofar as animals have conscious experiences, this is a significant fact about their nature and their lives. On the other hand, if conscious experience is limited to a single species, this presents neuroscientists with the important challenge to identify what attributes of human brains differ in this important respect from animal brains that are made up of very similar neurons, synapses, and glial cells. Presumably, any such human uniqueness arises from some yet to be discovered patterns of interaction among the same basic components that are present in animal brains. For empirical scientists these are deeply challenging questions, and in the near future we can only hope for limited progress toward answering them. For the time being, we must be content with partial, suggestive, or ambiguous evidence on which we can nevertheless base reasonable infer- ences that can then be subjected to critical evaluation. Even small exploratory 233</page><page sequence="2">steps in this direction are important, because a truly comparative under- standing of nonhuman conscious experience could provide significant insights into the basic nature of consciousness, just as our knowledge of bio- logical structure and function has benefited greatly from the investigation of comparative anatomy and physiology. Biologists and psychologists have succeeded in learning a great deal about the behavior of animals, which has turned out to be much more complex and versatile than previously believed. But for the most part they have been extremely reluctant to consider the pos- sibility that nonhuman animals might have subjective, conscious experi- ences. Yet identifying and understanding the conscious experiences of animals could well be a significant part of the behavioral sciences, for inso- far as animals experience fear, hunger, aggressiveness, affection, or the like these may be important factors affecting how they behave. I will approach the question of animal consciousness from a physical- istic (or materialistic) perspective and assume that mental experiences result from physiological processes occurring in central nervous systems, and thus are neither tangible objects nor immaterial essences. They can be considered roughly analogous in this respect to homeostasis (the self-regulating opera- tion of many physiological systems), which is an important process but one that cannot be pinned down to a specific structure. There is no need to appeal to divine intervention or vitalism in seeking to understand animal consciousness. Scientific investigation of human consciousness has undergone a recent renaissance. Even distinguished and talented molecular biologists have turned to active investigation of the physiological basis of consciousness, and several international meetings and books have been devoted to the sub- ject.2 On the other hand, most of the scientists who study animal behavior see no way in which objectively verifiable data about nonhuman private experiences can possibly be obtained, and almost all are uncomfortable when the question of animal consciousness is raised. But there is no funda- mental reason why scientists cannot make significant progress toward understanding nonhuman consciousness. Indeed, they have already done so; for many biologists and psychologists are actively investigating animal cog- nition, which is customarily defined as information processing within the animal's nervous system. Cognition in this sense is a necessary but not suf- ficient condition for conscious experience, but most of the scientists who emphasize this approach devote very little attention to the possibility that any conscious, subjective mental experiences might accompany the cogni- tion that they study.3 One of the most vigorous critics of attempts to study animal consciousness has asserted that: "Although we cannot be certain that no animals are conscious, we can say that it is most unlikely that any of them are."4 This is a very strong hypothesis, which would be falsified if we 234</page><page sequence="3">learned that a single chimpanzee had experienced even a fleeting conscious episode. When scientists are challenged by a difficult and fundamental problem it is a prudent strategy to begin by investigating its simplest and most basic aspects with the hope that if our ignorance about these can be significantly reduced, it will then be possible to move on to inquire about more complex attributes. This paper will therefore consider only perceptual consciousness, which the psychologist Natsoulas called "Consciousness 3," defined as "the state or faculty of being mentally conscious or aware of anything." He con- sidered this "our most basic concept of consciousness, for it is implied in all the other senses (of the term)."5 Farthing and others use such terms as core or primary consciousness for this type of simple conscious awareness.6 Animals might also experience reflective consciousness, which Natsoulas calls Consciousness 4 and defines as "being aware of, or being in a position to be aware of, one's own perception, thought or other occurrent mental episode." Many who tend to deny that any nonhuman animal is con- scious seem to believe that only reflective consciousness is "the real thing," and that a creature is not truly conscious unless it can think about its own thoughts or those of others. Several students of animal cognition have inquired whether animals have what David Premack and Guy Woodruff called a "theory of mind." This term is not intended to imply any complex theorizing, but simply whether the animal attributes mental states to others. Chimpanzees show some evidence of such an ability, but Seyfarth and Cheney have inquired whether monkeys and baboons are aware of the men- tal states of their companions, and found no evidence that they are.7 Because it is difficult enough to evaluate evidence of nonhuman perceptual con- sciousness, I will not consider in this paper the possibility that animals also experience reflective consciousness or introspective metacognition. The content and the complexity of human conscious thoughts and feel- ings vary enormously, ranging from simple but conscious perceptions to feelings of fear or affection, to prepositional thinking in "if, then" terms and to our most complex and subtle insights. Furthermore, we often like, hate, fear, or admire what we are consciously thinking about; and there is every reason to suppose that insofar as animals experience conscious thoughts these are also accompanied by feelings. If there is evolutionary continuity of perceptual consciousness, animals presumably experience feelings about what they perceive. And it is reasonable to infer that they try to do what leads to pleasant experiences and to avoid what is painful, fearful, or other- wise unpleasant. In other words animals appear to make simple but rational choices about alternative actions and to select those they believe will get what they want and avoid what they dislike or fear. A few philosophers argue that concepts like belief and desire should be 235</page><page sequence="4">discarded as obsolete "folk psychology" because they will be replaced (eventually) by neurophysiological mechanisms. But this position confuses explanation with elimination. A comparable example is provided by the con- cept of heredity, which continues to be valid and useful after the molecular mechanisms of inheritance have been substantially explained. An equivalent physiological understanding of beliefs and desires would be a magnificent achievement, but would not eliminate the attribute thus elucidated.8 We often react to things we think about, but the two processes are not identical and do not always occur together. For we sometimes react without consciously thinking about what we are reacting to, and at other times we think about things without reacting to them in any way. Having no reason to suppose that animal consciousness and overt action are always tightly cou- pled, we must recognize that some of an animal's thoughts and feelings may not be expressed directly and immediately. Charles Darwin had no doubt that many animals experience simple conscious thoughts and subjective feelings.9 But evolutionary continuity does not by any means imply identity. Animals have changed enormously in the course of biological evolution, and the magnitude of the differences between animal and human mentality is astronomical. As A. N. Whitehead put it, "The distinction between men and animals is in one sense only a dif- ference in degree. But the extent of the degree makes all the difference."10 The issue discussed in this paper is whether the difference in mentality is absolute, with conscious thinking totally limited to our species, or whether simple forms of perceptual consciousness occur in other animals. Insofar as animals experience conscious thoughts, in addition to exten- sive nonconscious information processing, their thoughts are almost cer- tainly much simpler than human thinking. And nonhuman thoughts are presumably concerned with matters important to the animal, such as locat- ing food, avoiding dangers, and social interactions. It is also important to recognize that animal mentality need not be limited to reduced versions of human thoughts and feelings; animals may experience their own styles of consciousness, presumably adapted to their ways of life. The suggestion that animals may think in simple terms about matters that are vitally important in their lives need not be inflated into a straw man claim that they are enter- taining complex human ideas. Scientists have been strongly inhibited by a fear that any suggestion of animal consciousness would be anthropomorphic, and this in turn is widely considered a major error that scientists should avoid at all cost. For instance John Kennedy likened anthropomorphism to a disease.11 In scientific usage anthropomorphism means the assertion that a nonhuman organism displays some attribute or behavior that is in fact uniquely human. But this widespread and strongly held fear of anthropomorphism suffers from circu- 236</page><page sequence="5">lar reasoning: consciousness is assumed in advance to be uniquely human, and any suggestion to the contrary is then dismissed as an anthropomorphic blunder. Thus the charge that inferring consciousness in an animal is an anthropomorphic error is merely stating a prejudgment that consciousness is uniquely human. Yet fear of being accused of this alleged error has severely inhibited behavioral scientists from studying animal minds, as I have discussed elsewhere.12 These publications have served as figurative lightning rods that have elicited vigorous criticisms from behavioral scien- tists who seem to feel outraged, and even perhaps threatened, by the idea that animal consciousness might not only exist but be susceptible to scien- tific investigation. One of my books has been likened to Salmon Rushdie's Satanic Verses P Several philosophers have recognized the vacuity of the customary accusation that suggesting animals might be conscious is an anthropomor- phic error. Jonathan Bennett argued that bees are not rational even though their waggle dances constitute a symbolic communication system that serves to inform their sisters about the direction, distance, and desirability of at least four different types of objects that are of great importance to them. But he pointed out the emptiness of the customary charge of anthro- pomorphism: It begs the question to say that it is merely "sentimental" or "anthropomorphic" to credit bees with rationality. If "It is anthropomorphic to credit bees with rationality" means "To credit bees with rationality is to liken them to humans", then it is true but unhelpful; on the other hand, if it means "To credit bees with rationality is wrongly to liken them to humans", then it begs the question. More recently Bennett has thoughtfully discussed both the difficulties and the promise of a cognitive approach to ethology, calling for strict standards to be applied to evidence of mental states in animals; and he finds most of the available evidence to be inadequate. Yet he encourages the search for better evidence, in contrast to those who insist that the task is impossible.14 Radner and Radner also discussed the current usage of "anthropomor- phic" as a disparaging adjective when applied to any suggestion of animal consciousness, concluding that "given the framework of evolutionary biol- ogy, it is difficult to see what justification there can be for a general indict- ment of anthropomorphism."15 And more recently Fisher has explored in detail the nature of the customary charge that suggestions of animal con- sciousness are mistakenly anthropomorphic and concludes that The idea that anthropomorphism names a widespread fallacy in commonsense thinking about animals is largely a myth . . . and the use of the term as a critical cudgel ought to be given up. It 237</page><page sequence="6">cannot stand for what it is supposed to. . . . Without a plausible defense that ascriptions of mental states to nonhuman animals is a categorical fallacy, the most basic assumption of critics of anthropomorphic thinking is shown to be untenable.16 It is thüs entirely reasonable to inquire whether animals experience and act on simple conscious thoughts, such as consciously perceiving a colored fruit on a tree, believing it will taste good, and deciding to climb the tree and eat it. Although most people would be likely to reply "Of course; why bother to ask?" many behavioral scientists argue that it is anthropomorphic and unscientific even to entertain such questions. Yet biologists are not accused of anthropomorphism when they compare human breathing, diges- tion, circulation, kidney function, or synaptic transmission with that of other mammals. Physiology and medicine have made enormous advances by tak- ing it for granted that bodily functions are similar enough that knowledge derived from studies of animals can lead to significant understanding of human physiology and disease. Even many aspects of behavior are routinely considered sufficiently similar that learning, for example, has been exten- sively studied in rats and pigeons with the realistic hope that general con- clusions based on animal studies are helpful in understanding human learning. Scientists are alert to the possibility of differences between species, but they generally assume an evolutionary continuity of structure, function, and even such basic aspects of behavior as learning and motivation. Subjective experience is almost the only attribute that has remained immune from recognition of evolutionary continuity. This virtual taboo against animal consciousness has been maintained by aversive conditioning of students and young people interested in animals by means of strong and often nonverbal admonitions that this is something that no respectable scientists should dare to mention let alone study. Expressing an interest in animal mentality is no way to obtain good grades in psychol- ogy or ethology courses, nor is it helpful to be accused of anthropomor- phism when applying for fellowships, research grants, or academic employment. As John Searle has put it succinctly: As recently as a few years ago, if one raised the subject of con- sciousness in cognitive science discussions, it was generally regarded as a form of bad taste, and graduate students, who are always attuned to the social mores of their disciplines, would roll their eyes at the ceiling and assume expressions of mild dis- gust. Searle later extended in greater detail his appeal for a rekindling of interest in consciousness.17 A more practical and understandable reason for avoiding the subject of animal consciousness has been scientists' belief that even if it exists no evi- 238</page><page sequence="7">dence about it can be obtained by scientific methods. Subjective experience is held to be private in the sense that it is knowable only by the experienc- ing organism, and in the case of animals the prevailing opinion has been that no conceivable procedure can provide objective data accessible to human investigators. Most scientists who study animal behavior have therefore assumed that no data about animal consciousness could be verified or falsi- fied by other investigators. Yet there are actually several sources of scientific data that bear on the likelihood that particular animals are thinking about specific aspects of their environment. I have suggested a simple approach by which scientists might overcome the difficulty of gathering verifiable data about animal thoughts and feelings.18 This is based on the fact that when we judge what our human companions are thinking and feeling we rely heavily, though not exclu- sively, on human communication, both verbal and nonverbal. A comparable approach can now be applied to many animals, because ethologists have learned that animal communication is much richer and more versatile than scientists had previously imagined.19 It is therefore distinctly possible that on some occasions when animals communicate they are expressing simple thoughts and feelings, and that monitoring the communicative signals exchanged by these animals can provide objective data about the experi- ences that are being expressed. Although this source of data about animal thoughts and feelings is necessarily imperfect and incomplete (as is even human communication), its availability means that it is no longer impossi- ble in principle to learn anything at all about animal consciousness. One clear example of animal communication that provides a glimpse into what animals may be thinking and feeling is provided by the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, that were described in detail by Thomas Struhsaker. When vervet monkeys see one of three classes of dan- gerous predator (ordinarily a leopard, martial eagle, or python), they typi- cally give a particular type of alarm call. Controlled experiments by Seyfarth, Cheney, and Marler later showed that the appropriate escape responses, which are distinctly different in the three cases, could be elicited by the playback of previously recorded alarm calls in the absence of a real predator.20 These three types of alarm call convey specific semantic infor- mation that one of three dangerous predators is in the vicinity. Although it is possible that these different alarm calls elicited by different sorts of dan- ger are stereotyped reflexes performed unconsciously, it seems more likely that the monkey giving the alarm calls thinks about the predator it has seen, the escape behavior its call will elicit from its companions, or both. Another type of evidence is available from studies of captive apes that have been trained to communicate by signals adapted from human language. The first major step was training chimpanzees to use gestures modeled after 239</page><page sequence="8">the sign language of the human deaf to express simple thoughts and answer simple questions.21 More recent experiments have demonstrated an ability of some individual apes to use a modified computer keyboard to make sim- ple statements, announce desires and intentions, and to answer simple ques- tions.22 Dolphins and sea lions have also been trained to respond to meaningful and somewhat syntactic relationships between commands con- veyed either through stylized gestures or underwater sounds.23 Even more significant has been the success of Irene Pepperberg in train- ing an African Grey parrot named Alex to use his imitations of English words to ask for things he wants, to name objects shown to him, and to answer questions about the color, material, shape, and number of familiar or unfamiliar objects. Although the great bulk of Pepperberg's discoveries have involved Alex, she has recently trained two other African Grey parrots to use spoken words in some of the simpler ways in which Alex was first trained. Pepperberg has tried very hard to arrange controls to greatly reduce or eliminate the possibility of inadvertent cueing, or "Clever Hans errors." Any such cueing would have to convey to the parrot which word it should utter, out of dozens it has learned to use, rather than a simple "go/no go" choice.24 Pepperberg has developed a novel and effective "model/rival" training procedure in which two familiar human companions talk to each other about objects in which the parrot has shown an interest. One asks questions such as "What's this?" the other responds, and the two frequently change roles. Some responses are purposely incorrect or indistinct, similar to errors made by the bird, and the first speaker then corrects the second. The parrot comes to participate in these exchanges, and after prolonged training Alex learned to say the names of about forty objects and to answer questions about then- color, material, or shape, whether two objects were the same or different, and, if different, whether in color, material, or shape. He also answers ques- tions about numbers of objects up to six. This procedure results in a strong social bond between the parrot and the trainers, and Alex almost always refuses to participate in these vocal exchanges with strangers. This complicates testing the bird's understanding of the questions and his answers, and critics are therefore concerned that Alex's responses may have resulted from inadvertent cueing by the investi- gators or "Clever Hans errors" of the sort discussed by Oskar Pfungst, Robert Rosenthal, and Thomas Sebeok. To guard against inadvertent cueing during testing of the parrot's performance, while maintaining motivation to answer questions, Pepperberg sits across the room facing away so that she cannot see the parrot, or another experimenter, called the secondary trainer, or the object shown to the bird. The secondary trainer, who shows the bird test objects and asks questions, is always a different person from the one 240</page><page sequence="9">who has trained him to make a particular sort of discrimination, such as color, shape, number, or same versus different. A third person has previously arranged that the test objects are made available in a sequence known to nei- ther Pepperberg nor the secondary trainer. After Alex has learned a particular identification or discrimination, he answers correctly about 80 percent of the time. Pepperberg counts as errors partial deficiencies, such as giving the right object name but omitting the color. He has a repertoire of roughly eighty spoken words, and when asked a question there is no way he can know in advance which of these is the cor- rect one to utter. The testing is done by intermingling test questions among presentations of different objects during training on quite different problems. Approximately three-quarters of the objects shown to Alex are for training on different discriminations, and the balance are test questions. This further lowers the likelihood that some pattern in the procedure could provide infor- mation about the correct answer to the secondary trainer's test questions. There remains a possibility of inadvertent cueing by the secondary trainer who can see the test objects. But such cueing would have to be quite detailed, in contrast to the simple "go/no-go" information inadvertently sup- plied to Clever Hans. It would have to convey the correct answer by some nonverbal signaling of color, shape, material, number, or sameness versus difference. Conceivably, for example, the question "How many?" might be modulated in such a way as to convey to the parrot "threeness" or "five- ness"; or the question "What color?" might be accompanied by a nonverbal signal meaning green or yellow. But this seems a rather remote possibility. In one set of experiments designed to test whether Alex could report relative size of two objects there were only two possible answers, so that the possibility of inadvertent cueing seemed more likely. In this case the test objects were presented in a box so arranged that the secondary trainer could not see them, and Alex was as about as accurate as in other experiments. But the box proved to be a great distraction; Alex tended to play with it rather than answering the questions at all, and as a result it was not used in other tests. As with any other scientific discovery, the crucial test of its correctness is replication by other investigators. The magnitude of the time and effort needed for this process of rival/model training of an African grey parrot has so far prevented such replication. Given the nature of the social situation required to get the parrots' cooperation in these experiments, it is difficult to see what further efforts could be made to guard against inadvertent cueing. On balance, it seems to me that Pepperberg 's conclusions are justified. The discovery that a parrot can mean what he says is profoundly significant, even if he understands the meanings of only some of the words he utters. Criticism of these experiments with apes, dolphins, and parrots has 241</page><page sequence="10">largely involved questions about the relationship to human language of the communicative behavior these animals have learned. No one claims that they have mastered anything remotely approaching the versatility of human language. There is, for instance, very little evidence of what the psycholin- guist George Miller25 aptly called the "combinatorial productivity" of human language, that is, our ability to recombine words or syllables in new ways to achieve a variety of new meanings. But despite the enormous gap between the accomplishments of even the most versatile communicating apes and human language, these animals clearly express simple thoughts by using these artificial communication systems. And it seems more likely than not that they experience something close to what they are expressing. The potential of animal communication as a figurative "window" on animal consciousness has so far been appreciated by only a few of the sci- entists concerned with animal behavior and cognition. For instance Jacques Vauclair dismissed this possibility on the ground that it would require ani- mals to have the same experiences as we do: "l'approache . . . repose sur l'hypothèse éminemment discutable selon laquelle les animaux étudiés partagent les mêmes expériences conscientes que l'homme."26 But there is no reason why animal experiences must be identical with their human coun- terparts. Human thoughts and feelings differ across cultures as well as with age and gender; and there is even less reason to expect identity across species. To require such identity implies that human experiences are the only conceivable kind. The usefulness of animal communication as evidence of animal thoughts has also been questioned by Peter lyack because he feels that "the ability to communicate with people using language is a mixed blessing for cognitive scientists; talking, by itself, may often be a shallow and mislead- ing probe of cognition."27 But the usefulness of communicative behavior, human or animal, is not so much to probe into the basis of cognition as to tell us something about what the communicator is thinking or feeling. It is important to distinguish between two kinds of questions about animal con- sciousness. The first is to learn whether a particular animal is conscious at all, and if so what the content of its conscious experience is. The second is to explain what caused the animal to have conscious experiences with a par- ticular content. Communicative behavior has great potential for the first objective, but is very limited as a means of achieving the second. Many nonconscious processes affect our mental experiences, and under some experimental conditions human subjects are not aware, and cannot report verbally, that certain influences have affected their opinions or their behavior. This has often been said to show that even human consciousness is unimportant, and by implication that animal consciousness must also be insignificant. But it is important to recognize the demonstration that we are 242</page><page sequence="11">not conscious of all the factors that affect our behavior, and our mental experiences, does not contradict the common-sense belief that we are often conscious of our intentions and plans and sometimes make rational choices about alternative actions in the belief that certain ones will achieve what we want or avoid what we dislike or fear. A 1977 paper by Nisbett and Wilson is widely cited as evidence that human subjects often do not know, con- sciously, that certain factors influence their thoughts and opinions.28 But several later papers have expressed strong reservations concerning the gen- erality and significance of the data reported by Nisbett and Wilson. Goldman has pointed out, "What their evidence really addresses is people's putative access to the causes of their behavior. . . . Moreover, Nisbett and Wilson explicitly concede direct access to many or most of the private states . . . that concern philosophy of mind in general."29 In fact, Nisbett and Wilson recognized in their 1977 paper that "we do indeed have direct access to a great storehouse of private information. . . . The individual knows a host of personal historical facts; he knows the focus of his attention at any given point in time; he knows what his current sensa- tions are and has . . . 'knowledge' at least quantitatively superior to that of observers concerning his emotions, evaluations, and plans." Wilson later agreed that "[i]t is undoubtedly true that people have direct access to many (if not most) mental states."30 Thus experiments like those of Nisbett and Wilson do not demonstrate that conscious experiences are nonexistent; they simply show that we are often unaware of the factors that influence them. Velmans has argued that "consciousness nearly always results from focal-attentive processing (as a form of output) but does not itself enter into this or any other form of human information processing." But as pointed out by many commentators on Velman's paper, and especially by Goldman, the evidence presented by Velmans does not fully support the second claim, and in his response to the commentaries Velmans stated that he did not "wish to remove consciousness from models of mental functioning . . . information processing models that view humans only from a third-person perspective are incomplete."31 In short, there is no reason to abandon the common-sense assumption that human consciousness is real and significant, and that it sometimes does have a major effect on our behavior, even though it is not the only important influence. Insofar as animals also have conscious experiences, whatever their nature may be, there is no reason to doubt that these will have some effects on their behavior. Nor does the fact that we do not consciously rec- ognize all the influences that affect our minds and actions mean that animal consciousness must necessarily be nonexistent. The "communication-as- window" approach promises to reveal something about animal conscious- ness when at present we are told that we can never learn anything at all 243</page><page sequence="12">about it. To reject this approach because it will not reveal everything that an animal experiences, let alone every influence that affects its experiences and behavior, is not helpful to scientific progress. The tendency to demand absolute certainty before accepting any evi- dence about mental experiences of animals reflects a sort of double stan- dard. For in other scientific subjects we are fully accustomed to making the best of incomplete and often confusing evidence. Indeed, a demand of abso- lutely perfect evidence before reaching even tentative conclusions would have seriously impeded progress in almost every area of science, especially in the early stages of investigation. For example, early-twentieth-century biologists did not refuse to study chromosomes because they could see no way to determine the exact chemical nature of genes. This demand for per- fection of evidence appears to be a subtle and largely unconscious way of avoiding the issue of animal consciousness; and it is thus an insidious bar- rier to scientific investigation. When it is taken as an excuse to deny that any conceivable evidence about nonhuman experiences will ever be attainable it amounts to a sort of paralytic perfectionism. Another general approach to investigating animal consciousness is to search for physiological evidence of particular kinds of brain activity that may correlate with its occurrence. Such evidence is already available from studies of human subjects who can report verbally what they are thinking and feeling, and to a limited extent comparable data have been obtained from animals. None of the physiological evidence yet available is ideally specific and unequivocal, but some of it is promising.32 One important cat- egory of physiological evidence of this type to be gathered from both human and animal subjects are the so-called Event Related Potentials (abbreviated ERPs) recorded from electrodes on the scalp in response to sensory stimu- lation. They are of such low amplitude that they must ordinarily be detected by averaging the electroencephalographic potentials (commonly known as "brain waves") after repeated stimulation by visual patterns or sounds. Under some conditions the ERPs occurring with a latency after stimulation of about 0.3 to 0.5 second vary not only with the intensity of the stimulus but also with its importance to the subject. In one type of experiment, two stimuli are presented in an irregular and unpredictable sequence, and if the subject has reason to pay more attention to one than to the other, the more important signals result in larger average ERPs. The importance may be due to instructions to a human subject that he should press a lever when he receives one type, or an experimental animal may have learned that one type signals that something pleasant or unpleas- ant is about to happen. It is not clear to what extent a larger ERP means that the subject is conscious of the stimuli, but further development of this sort of experiment might bring us closer to finding a specific physiological cor- 244</page><page sequence="13">relate of conscious perception. Data from ERPs is severely limited, how- ever, by the fact that surface electrodes record only averages of the electri- cal potentials generated within the brain by thousands of neurons and synapses, and it is even difficult to be sure just which parts of the brain are producing the particular waveforms measured at the scalp. More promising in some ways are recently developed noninvasive methods of recording brain activity, especially positron emission tomogra- phy (abbreviated PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (abbreviated MRI). These methods produce three-dimensional images of the brain in which the local brightness of the image correlates with the degree of metabolic activ- ity or blood flow.33 There is considerable variability in the resulting images, and some of the clearest evidence is obtained by subtracting the intensity of the image under one condition from that obtained when the subject is engaged in some different mental activity. There are also limitations of tem- poral and spatial resolution of this type of functional imaging, but improve- ments in resolution are continuing. It is already possible to determine by these methods that certain areas of the human brain are more active when particular types of perception or preparation for some simple motor action are occurring. Furthermore these techniques have already demonstrated that when a human subject thinks about something the same areas of the brain are active as when he perceives the same thing directly. A limitation of these functional imaging procedures is that they reveal where in the brain some form of information processing takes place, but they do not tell us what neural structure or function is uniquely correlated with conscious as contrasted with nonconscious information processing. Therefore it is not yet possible to distinguish with complete certainty between images that result from unconscious as opposed to conscious thought. But in due course differences may be discovered in the images of nonconscious and con- scious brain activity, the latter being identified by the subject's verbal reports. Similar methods of functional imaging are beginning to be applied to ani- mals, subject only to practical methodological considerations, such as the spa- tial resolution of the imaging and the need for the subject's head to remain stationary within the apparatus. But it is no longer correct to maintain that it is completely impossible to monitor brain activity and determine whether there are differences between conscious versus unconscious thinking. Nevertheless many behavioral scientists have not yet been sufficiently impressed by these developments to refrain from severe criticisms of sug- gestions that animals may think consciously on the ground that such ideas are anthropomorphic. For example, Davis has argued that ascriptions of mental experiences to nonhuman animals are wholly unsound and should be avoided at all cost in any scientific psychology. He even claims that con- sciousness has little influence on human behavior.34 245</page><page sequence="14">On the other hand, Gordon Burghardt has proposed that cognitive ethologists adopt what he calls "critical anthropomorphism" by making cau- tious inferences about mental states in animals on the basis of behavioral observations.35 He has also suggested that ethologists add a fifth major objective to the four that Tinbergen proposed as central to scientific ethol- ogy (to explain the causation, development, evolution, and survival value of behavior patterns). This fifth objective is to describe and analyze the private experiences of animals and the effects of these subjective mental states on the animal's behavior. Burghardt summarizes his proposal for an expansion of a maturing science of ethology by concluding, We now do seem to be at the stage where we can say that how animals perceive, experience, and comprehend their world is an important question. ... It is important to maintain a balanced perspective that does not dismiss the potential role of individual personal experience in studying behavior. In the past this dis- missal has occurred by treating such phenomena as outside sci- ence, by explaining them away as something else and thus ignoring them 36 Colin Allen and Marc Bekoff have reviewed the extensive evidence that a cognitive approach to explaining animal behavior can lead to impor- tant new discoveries and insights. They also discuss the variety of highly divergent opinions about cognitive ethology, but they remain cautiously noncommittal about animal consciousness.37 On the other hand, Marian Dawkins and other ethologists consider it reasonable to infer that many ani- mals are sometimes conscious.38 It is helpful to consider two specific examples of investigations of ani- mal behavior that were motivated, at least in part, by an interest in what ani- mals were feeling and thinking. The first concerns what is usually called the predator-distraction behavior of ground-nesting plovers displayed when a larger animal approaches their eggs or young chicks. The plover may approach the intruder and call loudly - a marked contrast to the usual behavior of simply flying away when no eggs or young are present. It often acts as though injured, flopping on the ground with wings held in awkward positions. But when approached the seemingly injured bird manages to flut- ter just far and fast enough to avoid being captured. After doing so for some distance, it suddenly recovers fully and flies away, though seldom straight back to the starting point. A plover performing these displays looks very much like a bird with a broken wing, and it used to be customary to call these performances injury feigning. But in the behavioristic decades of this century, ornithologists came to believe that it was an anthropomorphic error to imagine that a mere bird might consciously want to lead an intruder away from its eggs or 246</page><page sequence="15">young, and therefore the term "predator-distraction display" was adopted. To explain why these displays look so much like injury feigning, it was claimed that they resulted from a severe conflict between a motivation to attack the intruder and an opposing tendency to flee. This conflict was said to reduce the bird to a series of convulsions. Carolyn Ristau has reexamined this type of behavior motivated in part by considering the possibility that plovers might actually be trying to pro- tect their eggs or young by leading intruders away. She found that the so- called convulsions were remarkably coordinated. The birds watch the intruder and vary their displays according to what it does. Furthermore, in almost every case, the displaying plover's positions and directions of move- ment resulted in the intruder moving away from the eggs or young. This often required the bird to fly past an approaching intruder to avoid perform- ing distraction displays in a position that would cause the intruder to come closer to the eggs or chicks. Ristau found that plovers learned after a few exposures to human intruders approaching according to different experimental procedures to dis- play more strongly if the intruder had previously approached the nest directly and acted in a more threatening manner rather than passing by tan- gentially. They even learned to distinguish between human intruders who had or had not gazed directly at them. And when these two distinctively dressed human intruders were seen at a distance, the birds displayed more vigorously toward the one who had previously come closer to the nest and acted in a more threatening manner.39 The second example has an even more direct relation to preliminary attempts to rekindle scientific interest in animal minds. In my 1984 book Animal Thinking I mentioned a published observation suggesting that nest- ing ravens had tried to drop stones on a biologist who was climbing a cliff to reach their nest. Bernd Heinrich of the University of Vermont, who has extensive experience studying the behavior of ravens, pointed out that they drop things when upset under a variety of conditions, that he has never seen them hit an intruder with anything they drop, and that there was no reason to believe that they were intentionally trying to do so in this case. But this stimulated him to try to devise a test that might help determine whether ravens understand how to solve a novel problem. Heinrich kept five one-and-one-half-year-old ravens ever since they had been captured as nestlings in a large cage, from which he could observe them through a window by his kitchen table. They had never had any string, rope, vines, or other stringlike object in their cage until he began his exper- iments. When the ravens were hungry, he provided small pieces of hard, dried salami hanging on strings from a horizontal pole across the cage on which they often perched. At first they could not obtain the meat, but after 247</page><page sequence="16">several hours, one raven suddenly performed a coordinated series of maneu- vers that enabled him to reach it. This required the raven to reach down, grasp the string with his beak, pull it up, step on it with one foot, let go with the bill and reach down to grasp the string lower down, and again pull it up and hold more of it with the foot. The string was so long that these steps had to be repeated five or six times before the raven could reach the meat. The whole sequence had to be completed before the bird obtained any food, and it was carried on without any preliminary partial steps except for brief pulls on the string without holding it with the foot. Three of the other four ravens later began to obtaiii meat by the same method, and each one carried out the whole sequence the first time. The fifth raven did not perform the pull-and-hold behavior, but she did obtain some meat that the others had pulled up to the horizontal perch in this way. In car- rying out these experiments, Heinrich wished to keep the ravens hungry and highly motivated for as long as practicable, and on more than one hundred occasions after one had pulled up a piece of hard salami, he frightened it so that it flew off to a different perch. When hungry ravens are disturbed while they have a small piece of food in their beaks, they almost always fly off with it and continue feeding elsewhere. This led Heinrich to consider and to test a hypothesis about the degree to which these ravens understood the sit- uation. Would they realize that they could not carry off meat still attached to the string? The result of testing this hypothesis was that, in every case, the raven that had just pulled up meat attached to a string dropped it before taking off. But the bird that had never pulled up meat herself did fly off with the meat still held in her beak until it was yanked away when she reached the end of the string. These experiments were repeated with other ravens with essen- tially similar results, except that a smaller proportion of the birds performed the string-pulling routine. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the suc- cessful string pullers had not only realized how to get the food by a wholly novel series of actions, but that they also understood that they could not suc- cessfully fly off with meat attached to a string. The combination of solving the problem all at once and also refraining from flying off with the food still attached to the string (in sharp contrast to normal behavior) provides rather strong evidence of a simple level of insight. The raven string-pulling story does not end there, however. When Heinrich submitted a paper describing these experiments to one of the appropriate scientific journals devoted to animal behavior, it was repeatedly rejected with scathing reports from referees accusing Heinrich of uncritical anthropomorphism or the equivalent. It was finally accepted by a leading ornithological journal, whose editor was willing to overrule the same type of highly critical referee's recommendation that it again be rejected.40 This 248</page><page sequence="17">is a clear example of the hostility of many behavioral scientists to any evi- dence of animal mentality, and it goes far to explain why one finds virtually no scientific data about animal consciousness in the conventional scientific journals. The zeal to maintain critical scientific rigor has come to verge on censorship. Heinrich is an established senior scientist with a long record of respected contributions to comparative physiology and animal behavior. When someone with his reputation encounters this sort of antagonism, it is no wonder that younger scientists avoid studying a subject that is so widely held to be beyond the scientific pale. These observations and experiments do not rigorously prove that plovers consciously think about leading intruders away from their young or that ravens think about the properties of strings. Explanations involving genetic programs or learning can always be devised to account for whatever an animal may do, and a strict behaviorist finds these accounts completely sufficient and satisfying explanations that avoid any temptation to infer ani- mal, or human, consciousness. But unless we deny our own consciousness, and that of our human companions, consistency requires that we apply com- parable criteria across species. The dilemma faced by strict behaviorists is clearly described by Baenninger,41 who begins and ends a review of my 1992 book Animal Minds as follows: As I sit trying to compose a coherent reaction to this book my dog is lying with his head on my foot, gazing up at me. His ado- ration is visible (at least to me), and his desire for me to take him for a walk is almost palpable. It is difficult for me at such times to maintain the hard-nosed objectivity that is required of a scientifically respectable American comparative psychologist, trained to believe that my testable hypotheses should explain the behavior of animals in terms of the simplest or 'lowest* pro- cesses on the 'psychological scale.' (terms used by C. Lloyd Morgan). . . . There may be something uniquely upsetting for behavioral scientists about the concept of animal minds; nor- mally open-minded people in the behavioral sciences close their minds to the possibilities of animal minds. Lloyd Morgan believed that many animals experience what I call perceptual consciousness.42 Perhaps the major limitation on scientific progress in this area is the "hard-nosed objectivity that is required of a scientifically respectable comparative psychologist." The many arguments that have been advanced to show that one can never prove that an animal is conscious can be taken to mean that it is equally difficult to establish beyond doubt that they never are. One reaction of some scientists, such as Paul Silverman, is to admit that they have intu- itions that particular animals are conscious, but that this is not "real" science. 249</page><page sequence="18">Yet intuitions are often the basis and starting point of scientific inquiry, and unless hobbled by paralytic perfectionism, there is every reason to hope that our ignorance about the nonhuman mental experiences can be gradually reduced. Martin Mahner and Mario Bunge, in an effort to develop a rigor- ously consistent biological philosophy, take it for granted that some nonhu- man animals have minds and are sometimes conscious.43 Thus the antipathy to suggestions of animal consciousness may gradually fade away as new gen- erations of scientists take a fresh look at the questions of animal awareness. The current situation resembles the intense antagonism of many lead- ing behavioral scientists a generation ago to the notion that genetic factors might be important influences on animal behavior. It was widely held that structure is under genetic control, but that virtually all behavior is learned or at least was primarily controlled by environmental factors operating within the lifetimes of individual animals. But those heated arguments are seldom heard any more, and so I hope that in time the aversion to investigating ani- mal mentality will also wane. But the waning may be slower in this case, because the idea of evolutionary continuity of mental experience rouses even more intense emotional antipathy. It seems to threaten deep-seated philosophical convictions of human superiority. The scientific understand- ing of animal mentality may well constitute the final crowning chapter of the Darwinian revolution. NOTES Discussions with many colleagues have helped to clarify the ideas expressed in this paper, far too many to list. But Gordon M. Burghardt, Robert M. Seyfarth, Dorothy L. Cheney, Gayle B. Speck, Gerald and Barbara Massey, and the students in a Harvard College tutorial seminar on cognitive ethology have been especially constructive, par- ticularly when they have disagreed with me. 1.
