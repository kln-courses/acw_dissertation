<plain_text><page sequence="1">OLD RUG?TU RUG THE HIERARCHY OF SEDENT POSTURES IN TURKISH ICONOGRAPHY BY EMEL ESIN In traditional pictorial representations of Turkish princes and their attendants, postures are to be observed which are perplexing to the student of court ceremonial. These postures seem to be connected with the ?sana (Indian conventional postures of the lower limbs) whereas other features appear to reflect a Turkish custom. The costum consists in aligning those present at ceremonies held in and outside the cos mic tent in such a way that symmetrical groups were shown standing (Turug) and sitting (Oldrug orunj. The oldrug-turug disposition constituted a very definite ceremonial order, derived from the social organisation of the community1. Although trying not to lose sight of possible Buddhist and Taoist influences, we followed Prof. Rintchen's advice, in searching also in the conventions of the oldr?g turug^ the significance of some Turkish sedent postures. The search led us far back in time to a world where the communal order was yet governed by cosmic concepts, to the symbols of probably proto-Turkish peoples, such as the ancient Chou2 (1050 247 B.C.) and the Hsiung-nu3 to whose Ts?-k'? tribe the G?k-T?rk were said to be directly affiliated (second cent. B.C. to the fifth cent. A.D.). The following abbreviations are used : Albaum L. U. Albaum, Balal?k-tepe (Tashkend 1965) Arat R.

The hierarchic aligment in the cosmic space We evoked the indistinct image, lost in the mists of time, of the Chou period con cept of the universe4: a square earth- expanse surmounted by the hemispheric heaven whose pole was the polar star. Both the celestial hemisphere and the qua drangular earth were divided in eight segments, which conjointly represented the spatial expanse and the temporal cycle of the calender : each direction corresponded simultaneously to a location, and to the altar of some cosmic deity, as well as to a season and to an hour. The central station below the polar-star, seat of the heavenly god, was the emperor's conventional place. The altar of heaven was in the south, a direction which as the apparent zenith of the diurnal solar course seems to have had precedence since ancient times. The solar and lunar altars and those of the forefathers of the "hundred families" of Chou race, were in the east and west. The five planets, associated to directions and seasons, had equally their place in the cosmic space. According to Shiratori's5 research, in the Han period of China and in Hunnic concepts, the stars which compose the Ursa Major group had equally some anthropomorphic counterparts and conventional places in attendance to the polar star seat of the celestial god and emperor and corresponded to the empress and to the emperor's closest family and attendants. Shiratori further states that the "golden statues" which figured in the temple of celestial and ancestral cult of the Hui-t'o Huns of Kansu, in ca. 121 B.C., might have represented such astral deities. The Chou6 further honoured the gods of the fire-place, kitchen, threshold and of the way, which definitely seem to have connections with the symbolism and cults of the tent, as in the case of the Hsiung-nu and of Turks. The round altar of heaven, of the Chou, the rotunda-tent of the Hsiung-nu and Turkish monarchs represented the heavens7. Both in the Chou and in the Hsiung-nu concepts, the cult of heaven was an aristocratic privilege, possibly reserved to those of astral descent, such as the Hunnic shan-y? who was the offspring of the sun and of the moon8. In these 4 ?zerdim 18?23. 5 Shiratori 45?6, 49. 6 ?zerdim 18?23. 7 Eberhard 21?3. ?sm, Qufctaa 283?4, ?

The common people, who descended from demons had no access to the celestial platform. They conventionally lived in the four corners of the quadrangular earth which remained outside the hemispheric dome of heaven9. Music preceded or accompanied the celestial10 cults. The symmetrical alignment of dignitaries, in "four" and in "six corners" and that of representatives of confederate tribes, around the Hunnic shan-y? who faced the south11, again established a cosmic space. The alignment is said to have corresponded either to the geographic location of the tribes or to a hierarchy in which the east, conventional station of the sun, to the left of the shan-y?, had precedence12. The examples which follow show that if not these concepts, at least the formal scheme which was their expression, survived tenaciously amongst Turks. The round and domed royal tent, or its equivalent, the domed room which represented the universe13, was divided in symmetrical halves along an axis which went from the t?r and orun (the place of honour and throne) to the qapug and its il or e?ik (the entrance and its threshold)14. The alignment, in two or four symmetrical groups, along cardinal directions, is generally reported in connection with some ceremonial or cultual banquet (asama15, ??lenl?, d?rnek17), in which, to the sound of music, meat distributed to the heads of tribes and to dignitaries and a tolu18 (full cup) was reached in token of rank or office. The orientation of the t?r-kap?g axis depended on the prevailing cults : the occupant of the t?r, sat in or turned his face, towards the honoured direction. The distinction which we know from Chinese sources, between yin and yang or other cosmic concepts, such as the differentiation between heavenly and earthly appurtenances, seem to have guided the alignments. These cosmic concepts may have survived through tradition. The Shamanist cults have developed as a repository of these ancient conventions. In some cases, the occupant of the t?r sat in the center, a location which in the tent is reserved to the fire-place 9 M.

Without going into the details of Turkish sun and fire-worship, or its connections with Iranian cults, we will recall that it is in rivalry with the veneration of the polar-star and that the eponym hero T?rk had lit the first fire20. Islam introduced new symbols which were adapted to older conventions. As a momentous change, the composition of the assembly was altered from an aristocratic to a democratic order. The low-born whom Turkish texts, call Qara (the Black), now entered the oldrug-turug assembly, together with the aq, the luminous sons of the dynasty of T?rk21. We may give some examples, in approximate chronological order. The G?k-T?rk qagan (emperor) was levitated by four princes, enthroned, facing the east, in homage to the sun and had right and left attendants ("wise king, yabgu, ?ad, etc. altogether 28 grades) who sat in the cardinal directions22. In the allocution inscribed on his mortuary stele, the last G?k-T?rk monarch, T?rk Bilge Qagan (died 754), describes himself, enthroned at the crossing of cardinal directions: "Forward to the rising sun, further to the direction of the solar zenith (the south, apparent point of apogee of the sun's diurnal course), behind, where the sun sets and above in the apogee of the night (the north location of the polar star), all the peoples therein turn towards me"23. The Qagan presumably throned in the middle of the tent which he considered the center of the world, with the sun and the polar star alternating their apogee, throughout the succession of days and nights, above him. On his sarcophagus (fig. 4), T?rk Bilge Qagan is shown frontally enthroned, cup in hand. Two sym metrically placed standing attendants, possibly "the left and right wise kings", also hold cups. In the funarary temple, probably built in Turkish custom to the model of the dwelling24, the statue of K?l Tigin (died 732), accompanied by the effigy of his wife, was surrounded by four groups of attendants, with the guards placed behind him25. T'ung Yabgu, the Western turkish qagan, whom Hs?an-tsang visited in ca. 650, throned and banqueted in his tent, with symmetrically placed groups of atten dants 26 : "The H?n dwelt in a tent decorated with golden flowers the splendour of which dazzled the eyes.

After ?hivopis pl. 10 question (fig. 2, 3) show scenes of banqueting performed by dignitaries, sitting on mats, as described by Hs?an-tsang. The center of the composition is formed by a fire-container which suggests a ritual significance of the ceremony. When in 922, Yaltivar33, the king of the Saq?liba, described as a Turkish people of the Volga area, banqueted with the Abbassid ambassadors, he throned in the middle of the tent, together with his wife on bis right. The military dignitaries were on his left and the ambassadors on his right below the h?t?n. The monarch's children faced him. At the Oguz ??lenu (communal banquet), the representatives of the twenty four tribes were ordained in right and left groups, with precedence of the right (in sources of the Islamic period), around the spoil of the hunt which was to be con sumed. Each tribal representative sat opposite the limb allotted by tradition to his tribe. The Oguz yabgu (monarch) throned at the level of the animal's head. It has been suggested that the division of the twenty-four tribes in groups corresponding to solar, lunar astral, mountainous and aquatic descent, had cosmic significances35. 30 See note 28. 31 See note 29. 32 See note 29. 33 .

The sons of Oguz who bore the names of Heaven, Mountain and Sea (G?k, Dag, Deniz) sat on the left, in the cited order. The early fifteenth century Ottoman author Yazici-Z?de adds36: "The drinking sequence is between senior and junior. Rank and title are granted in the same ceremony." "The stalwarts" (inaq) were at the gate and the Yabgu's close attendants behind him37. A division of the assembly in "luminous" (aq) and "obscure" (qara) groups, with the former seated in the t?r (seat of honour) and the latter in the qapug (entrance) becomes apparent in Qutadgu-bilig, the allegoric poem written in 1068, by Y?suf H?ss H?gib38, the chief of protocole of a king of Kasgar. The king in question belonged to a dynasty which upkept the Turkish tradition and bore the name of the eponym hero T?rk. The dynasty was also called H?q?nli (imperial: the Qara-h?nid of modern historians) and its members were considered "white-boned", and "aq" (luminous) in opposition to the "Qara" (the obscure, common people). Therefore, the inference of Y?suf H?ss H?gib's remark is that the aq (luminous) monarch and his dignitaries throne at the t?r, while the qara form the oldrug-turug, at the qapug. The term qapug (entrance) came to signify the service of the palace down to the Ottoman period. In Uygur compositions (fig. 1 ), some similar reason seems to direct the alignment of donor families, in which the men sit at the left of the cultual image and the women and monks on the right39. One gathers that this disposition is regulated by concepts in which the monarch, in this case the cultual image, turns to the south, as in Chou and Hunnic custom. The east, which in Chou conventions was the solar location, would then be occupied by the men and the west which was considered lunar, by women. This explanation would also accord with Chinese concepts in which the sun is the symbol oiyang and the moon of yin. Other conventions, linked with the Buddhist symbolism of world quarters, may equally have prevailed. Bernstam40 noted that the cities of Turkistan which originally had faced the car dinal directions, were oriented after Islam in the direction of the Qibla. The same change took place in the orientation of the assembly, in some monastic orders such as the Bektas? order, founded in Anatolia in the thirteenth to fourteenth century, in affiliation to the Yesev? of Turkistan, dating from the eleventh to twelvth centuries, 36 Uzuncarsih 96?7.

The heterodox Qizilbas T?rkmen41 (the Red-heads or Wearers of red hats) have analogous rites and the difference between the two orders appears to lie in the fact that the former were established in the capital of the Ottomans and were connected with the Janissary guards, while the latter were country people. In both orders, the mayd?n (assembly room) was directed towards the Qibla^. Paradoxically, however, the mihr?b was designated with the turkish word ocaq which means fire-place43 and a perpetually lit candle was placed at the right of the ocaq. Twelve stations were ordained in the mayd?n^ and indicated by that number of hides of sacrificial rams. These stations indicated the geographic location of the founder and major saints of the order, as well as the offices held by the seniors of the convent. In the Qizilbas maydan 45, on the right of the ocaq, at the eastern station called ?r (?) throned the dede, the superior of the con gregation. Below him sat the senior male members, starting with the head cup bearer, the lighter of candles, the head baker, the head-cook. On the right of the ocaq, on the western side, in the station called t?r as in Qutadgu-bilig, throned the "Tacli Baci" (Crowned sister), the oldest female member of the congregation. On her right, "the shadowy sisters", the wives of the senior male members, sat in the same order as their husbands. The lesser members of the community and the "G?zc?" (Monitor) sat in the vicinity of the entrance, the men in the east and the women in the west. When the ritual banquet and the cup-rites took place to the sound of music, each man sat beside his wife46. In all mayd?ns, Qizilbas and Bektasi alike47, the four cross-axially placed thresholds were the stations of the "Forty Eren" (?ilten in the poems of the founder of the Yesev? order) who were considered the guardians of the world quarters, somewhat similarly to the lokap?la or the Taoist immortals. The postulant, clad in a shroud, started the course of initiation at the threshold, then advanced to the dede, saluted the major stations and finally came to the center, to be metaphorically hanged on the tree-shaped pillar, decorated with candles, which supported the mayd?n's cupola (dar). To avoid tedious repetitions, we will simply remark that under the gilded cupola of the royal tent or in halls, the festive assemblies of Turco-Mongol kings were ge nerally ordained in one of the above-cited alignments48. The tenacity of these con ventions is shown by the fact that they still survive with a ritual character, in Eastern and Northern Asia, amongst Turkish populations. One last example will be given from these contemporary Central and Northern Asian ceremonies of Sha manist context49. On the occasion of cup-rites, the host, with his wife on his left, 41 See Sapolyo. 42 N?zhet, glossary. 43 N?zhet, glossary. 44 N?zhet, glossary. 45 Sapolyo 255, 264. 46 Sapolyo 264. 47 N?zhet, glossary, arts, ocak, baba postu, tig-bend, kirk-mak?m, niy?z, kar? post. 48 Blechsteiner see also Esin, "And". 49 Blechsteiner.</page><page sequence="11">Oldrug?Turug, The Hierarchy of Sedent Postures in Turkish Iconography 11 takes place in the t?r, opposite the threshold. The men and women form two separate groups, the men sitting below the host and the women, below the hostess. It may perhaps be deduced that the t?r-qapug axis is in this case in north-southerly direc tion, with the men in the east and the women in the west. Before the host and hostess is a tripod, an object of cultual banquets since the Chou period, in which is fire to which libations are made. This again is reminiscent of the banquet scenes of Turkestan! murals of the seventh to eigth centuries (figs. 2, )). Wine is placed over the tripod, and dispensed to the participants, again as on the murals (figs. 2, 3). The drinking ceremonies and the singing of laudatory poems, follow the traditional patterns. II. The postures of the occupants of the t?r 1. Bagda? The posture called bagta?inu00 in Uygur, bagda? 51 in H?q?nh and bagda?in qurmaq02 in Ottoman Turkish, consists in squatting with the folded legs symmetrically placed on both sides and the ankles crossed. The crossed ankles may either be hidden under the thighs (fig. 6) or visible in the front (fig. 4, 5, 7, 9). If the person in bagda? posture is sitting on an elevated place, the crossed ankles are represented slightly hanging down. The bagda?, a natural posture of ease, has been adopted in many lands. Its aspect of ritual posture is of some interest and we will review the available material in this connection. Some postures similar to the bagda? have been identified by Indian scholars as ?sanas. The variety of the bagda? in which the crossed ankles and feet are tucked away under the thighs (fig. 6) seems described by Banerjea 53, when he mentions the kurm?sana "in which the legs are crcf?sed so as to make the heels come under the gluteals". An ?sana which resembles the category of the bagda? in which the crossed feet and ankles remain in the front (fig. 9) is designated by Batthacharya54 as paryank?sana. Banerjea reserves the appelation paryank?sana to some other kind of ?sana and gives the name utkutik?sana to a posture reminiscent of the bagda?. Banerjea asso ciates the utkutik?sana with the Yogi custom of tying the knees in order to maintain the ritual posture for a long spell of time. He adds however that the utkutik?sana is not in the list of classical ?sanas. According to Bhattacharya, when the meditative stage in vajr?sana was terminated and the state of sattva was reached, the sage relaxed into the posture which he designates as paryank?sana and which the Turks 50 Arat 9, 11?2. ?

Williams55 fully supports this view on the ritual character of the bagda? in his description of the emergence from meditation : "The adamantine, unchangeable or fixed pose (Sanskrit. Vajra Palana) is the well-known, crossed-legged Buddha posture. The legs are locked firmly and the soles directed fully upwards. This is the pose of deepest meditation, hence it is also called, when the hands lie loosely in the lap, the Dhy?na or meditative mudra" (fig- 8). Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 4.

Mizuno supposed that the ?sana which is similar to the bagda? was a posture peculiar to Turkistan, but sought its origin in Persia. He could not however determine any Persian prototypes, except on some so-called Sassanian plates, which since Mizuno's article was written, have been traced to Central Asia57a. On the other hand, it will be seen that iconographie and literary material on the bagdas is abundant in Inner-Asian and in Turkish spheres of culture who produced the art-works which display this posture. Postures similar to varieties of the bagdas are observed on the relief sculpture in the funerary chambers of Han Period China 58, particularly in the representations of deities from Western and Hunnic areas (the Chinese monarchs and deities are generally otherwise enthroned). One may cite, as example, the depiction of the "Golden Statue" of the Hiu-t'o Huns59 of Kansu worshipped in connection with the cult of ancestors and of heaven. The "Golden Statue" was taken as booty from the Huns of Kansu, in the victorious Chinese campaign of 121 B.C. Kin-yi-ti, the son of king Hiu-t'o, who was equally made captive, was repeatedly represented, prostrated in profile, before "the Golden Statue" which is in a frontal view of the bagdas posture, with feet hidden under the thighs. It has been suggested that the "Golden Statue" was really a golden Buddha, so that the bagda? posture in which it is represented could be identified as a ritual Buddhist ?sana. It is certainly as a bodhisattva's ?sana that the variety of the bagda?, with ankles and feet in the front, appeared in the art of the Tabgac (Toba). But, as remarked by Mizuno61, the ?sana which looks like the bagdas, had definite links with the nomadic and Central Asian word. Indeed it is known61 that a Buddha statue was made to a Tabgac monarch's likeness and that there were "Northern" artists at the service of the Tabgac. Their art seemed to the Chinese, the expression of a "Hu" people (the Hsiung-nu and Central Asians). Sung-Y?n62 remarked in 518 that before reaching the southern regions of Central Asia, where Indian influences began to be felt, he had never seen a Buddha effigy which did not look like the Hu. While Sung-Y?n's remark establishes the predominantly non-Chinese character attributed to Tabgac art, of which the bagda? is a feature, some other evidence links the bagda? to Inner-Asia in the same period. In a Buddhist context, the posture is frequent in the art of the proto-Turkish Ts?-k'? Huns63 in Kansu (ill. 5). Further, 57a ?hivopis 135. 58 E.

The bagda? was also common in the representations of gods and kings of the G?k-T?rks. A petroglyph found in the southern Altay and dated in the early G?k-T?rk period, in the fifth to sixth centuries, shows a crowned figure, tentatively identified as Umay, the mother-goddess of the Turkish pantheon, in a frontally viewed bagda? posture (fig. 6)6?. A major attendant, on Umay's left is represented in bagda?, but in smaller stature. On his sarcophagus, the last G?k-T?rk qagan, T?rk Bilge, who died in 754, was represented by two Turkish artists, Azganaz Er Agar and ?iner, in a frontal bagda? (fig. 7) 67. The image on the sarcophagus may depict the first line of the stele of the Qagan : "I, the heavenly, heaven-born T?rk Bilge Qagan was then enthroned68." The bagda? was then conjointly the posture of Buddhist and other gods and kings 69. The Turkish kings were indeed worshipped as "celestial" (tengri-teg) and bodhi sattva-l?ke (bodhisattva-teg)10. This interrelation expresses the fact that, like their ancestors the Ts?-k'? Huns71, and their probable congeners, the Tabgac, the early G?k-T?rk were in contact with Buddhist culture. Buddhist currents came to the Turks also from Gandhara and two Turkish qagans of the sixth century were con verted by Gandharan monks and T'und Yabgu of the Western Turks had also become a Buddhist72. T?rk Bilge Qagan whose effigy in bagda? was made in 754 (fig- 7) equally had leanings to Buddhism73. All these qagans honoured also the Taoist way. The bagda? continued in the later centuries to be considered both a profane and a sacred posture of dignity. Its Buddhist character, as an ?sana of emergence from meditation is confirmed by the Turkish poet Atsang who describes his compatriot, a Buddhist saint74: "When, after having achieved serenity, our father throned in bagda? posture, in complete immobility ..." Dr. P. Zieme kindly drew my attention to a newly published Uygur text which leaves no doubt on the character of the bagdas as a posture of Buddhist meditation : 64 See Albaum pis. 96, 112 . 65 Chavarme* 156?7, 200, 292. 66 . ?gel, Isl?miyatteri ?nceki T?rk k?lt r t?rihi (Ankara 1959) pl. 13, 1. 67 Radloff pl.

Hazai, Ein Buddhistisches Gedicht aus der Berliner Turfan-Sammlung, Acta Orientalia Hung?ria, 25/1, Budapest 1970). The custom to tie the knees, in order to maintain the bagdas posture for a long time is also attested amongst the Tantric Uygur baqsi (master)74a. The bagdas was the most frequently represented ?sana in Buddhist Turkish art. It is repeatedly seen in the bronze plaques found in the T?rgis period (658?766) temple of Aq-besim (fig- 5), near or in the city of Toqmaq, founded under the Western Turks, which became a Turkish capital for seven centuries, under the Western Turks (581?658), the T?rgis (658?766), the Qarluq (766?850) and the H?q?nli (850?1250) dynasties75. It was later called Bal?s?g?n. In the figurative mandala, a Buddhist composition of symbolic character, in which the cosmic deities, such as the sun and moon and the hagiographie figures were grouped around a central cakravartin, the Turks reserved the bagdas posture in frontal view, to the main personage. The figures of the parivara could equally adopt the posture, but only in three-quarter view, turned in homage to the central figure. Such is the case of the patriarch in the representation of a family of donors. Solidly seated in bagdas, but turned towards the cultual image, he elevates it on his upraised arms (fig. 1 ). The reason for which the main personage was depicted frontally is explained in 1068 by Y?suf Hass H?gib: K?n-togdi (the Rising Sun), symbol of the H?q?nid monarch, throned frontally and commented in these verses the significance of frontality 76 : "Thou seest in my image the tradition of kings. Such are the manifestations of tradition. Behold and ponder! Whatever is rectilineal is of essential quality Thus, my manifestation never falters from rectitude. If rectitude were to tumble awry, Doomsday would come!" The monarch's frontal posture was therefore the image of unwavering impartiality. Those who entered the Qurvi uvac71 (the domed and cylindric royal tent) or the domed room, saw, as they stood at the qapug (entrance), the monarch throning in frontal posture at the t?r (throne). 74a A.

In the sphere of Buddhist Turco-Mongol culture however, a momentous develop ment took place, possibly sometime in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries: the art of perspective was developed which brought about, under Chinese influences, a relaxation in the composition of the figurative mandala. The composition lost its symmetrical disposition and its cosmic significance and merely represented the god's audience. The cultual image, placed now in the upper corner of the com position, was in three-quarter view and seemed to greet the file of worshippers or attendants. This type of naturalist composition appears in woodprints with Chinese characters80, as well as in those with Uygur Turkish text (fig. 14). The composition with the main personage in the upper corner continued well into the seventeenth century in Uygur Buddhist art, as seen on the illustrated mss. brought by Malo and others to the Institut Vostokovedeniya of Leningrad. The same composition was adapted by Islamic art, equally in the Mongol period, possibly in the fourteenth century. A probably pre-Islamic Il-H?nid miniature (fig. 13) of unknown origin, from the Miscellany Coll. H. 2152 of Topkapi, shows yet the monarch in frontal posture, in traditional Turco-Mongol regalia, with two pages holding behind him the "golden flowers" which Hs?an-tsang described in the audience of the Western Turkish king T'ung-Yabgu. Our reasons for the pre Islamic datation of this work have been expounded elsewhere81 and we will only remark here, that a similar work of the Islamic Il-H?nid period, dated in 1551, figures in the frontispiece of the ms R. 1479 of Topkapi, in which the same icono graphy has taken a wholly Islamic character. The miniature of unknown origin (fig. 13) shows a monarch with clean-shaven face and long hair, wearing a brimmed hat, like an Uygur dignitary of the same period (fig. 14J), sitting on the dragon throne, on a background in which the lotus and the ?arlra play a major, perhaps cultual part. On the frontispiece of the ms R. 1479, the monarch, probably the Il-H?n Ab? Sae?d, is bearded like a Muslim and wears the turban which the Abbassid caliphs presented to the Muslim kings on their enthronement. The dragon d?cor of the throne has been stylised to an unrecognisable curve. The ?arlra and lotus are absent. This monarch representation, dated 1551, is in three-quarter view. As to the unidentified miniature (fig. 15it represents, in our opinion, the Il-H?n Arg?n, who was a Buddhist under the influence of the Uygur baq?i (Buddhist masters) and whose appearance is somewhat similar in the traditional genealogical portraits, of 80 Museum f?r Indische Kunst, Staatliche Museen Stiftung Preu?ischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin-Dahlem, Turfan Smlg.

Later Bektas? paintings almost invariably sepresent the founder of the order in bagda? posture. The bagdas in three-quarter view was equally the posture in which the Salh al-Isl?m of the Ottoman Empire, Ab? Suc?d Efendi88 was represented in a painting dated in 1955. In present Turkish villages, the bagda? is the privilege of the learned hoga or of the dervish. The h?ggl who returns from pilgrimage is seated in bagda? posture on an elevated seat, while he receives the visit of his friends. K. Otto-Dorn89 noted that the bagda?, introduced to Europe through the Turks, was called T?rkensitz in Germany. By way of comparison, we will note that in Mongolia90 and in Sikkim, where Inner Asian traditions are still alive, a posture similar to the bagda? is reserved to the person of consequence who holds the highest seat in the assembly, generally opposite the entrance or at the corner diagonally opposed to it. I had the privilege to sit, amongst the attendants of the right hand, in a ceremony at the court of Sikkim where I saw the late Prince enthroned, in bagda? posture, remain in complete immobility, during several hours. The Prince of Sikkim seemed to demonstrate the ceremonial and ritual significance of the bagda?. 2. The classical ?sana in Turkish iconography^1 a) Four ?sana of princely or ritual character may be easily identified in Turkish iconography. We have already mentioned the adamantine ?sana of profound meditation (fig. 8) in connection with the bagda? to which it resembles, except that in the adamantine posture, the soles of the feet are turned upwards. This strictly ritual posture is often seen in Buddhist Turkish art but disappeared after Islam. b) Three other ?sana may equally express royal ease. The mah?ragalll? or adhra paryanka depicted a great monarch, resting on a couch. One folded leg lay on the side, while the other leg's folded knee was raised to a vertical position (fig. 18). The posture appeared in Uygur art in religious context, disappears for a while, in early Islamic Turkish iconography, in the H?q?nid and Sel?uqid age, and become frequent in Islamic art after the Mongol invasion. In the Timurid genealogies with Uygur inscriptions in Misceli. Coll. H. 2152 of Topkapi, the portraits of some Cingiz-Hanids are in the frontal variety of this posture. The ladies also adopt it, but they are depicted 87 Painting of Hariti in meditation with inwards squinting eyes: F-x-11-004 of the National Museum, Delhi, 88 Turkish ms.

A further difference: the men are represented with the left knee raised in vertical position, while the women elevate the rigth knee. Prof. Rintchen informed me that this was equally a Mongol convention and provided the explanation. In the assembly tent, the men sit on the right and the women on the left and each group avoids to point disrespectfully to the threshold with the foot of the horizontally folded leg. A curious reminiscence of cosmic conventions91* in these Uygur genealogies (ills. 24, 25) is the fact that men are in round frames (heaven) and women in squares (earth). Fig. 17 Fig. 18 Fig. 17.

Qalender P?s?92 (died 1614) depicted the Caliph c All, veiled as a concession to Sunnite othodoxy, in the mah?ragalll? ?sana, with the left knee raised up (fig. 19). b) Another ?sana, expressing ease, which is encountered in Turkish iconography, is the r?galallta or lalit?sana. In this ?sana, one leg is folded, while the other is pendant from the seat on which the figure thrones. The ragalallta is well illustrated in Turkish art, since the Buddhist period. The ?sana in question may be seen on a gilded bronze plaque (fig. 21 ) found at the Buddhist temple of Aq-besim93. The bearded figure in r?galallta on the Aq-besim plaque may well be a royal effigy. The r?galallta is also shown the ?sana of the bodhisattva Ma?jusri, riding a spotted feline (fig. 20) in an Uygur mural of the ninth to twelvth centuries. It is a re markable example of the survival of religious iconography that in the early sixteenth century, Qalender P?s?94 saw fit to represent in the same posture and on the same vehicle the Muslim saint Uwa?s al-Qaran? (fig. 23). The survival of the motif was probably due to the fact that a posture somewhat similar to the lalit? was adepted by the dervishes of the Yesev?95 order, founded in Turkestan in the twelvth century. The Timurid genealogies with Uygur inscriptions in Misceli. Coll. H. 215 of Topkapi as equally often give this posture to princely portraits, including that of Qubilay. c) The posture compared to the European manner of sitting, with both legs pendant, is frequent in Turkish iconography since the Buddhist and Manichean period of Uygur art96. The princes of the first grade, who had a right to the sandali^1 (the stool of honour) are often represented in it, in Il-H?nid paintings, at the station allotted to them, which was the entrance of the monarch's tent98. In the Timurid genealogies with Uygur inscriptions", the posture is given to the ancestors of the Cingiz-H?nid dynasty, as well to G?z?n H?n. Ottoman sultans, such as Ahmed I100, have been represented in the same posture. IV. The postures of homage Like the princely postures commented in parts II and III, the postures of homage of Turkish iconography are the residue of manifold traditions which are difficult to disentangle. A succession of terms, starting with the G?k-T?rk word y?k?nmek101 (homage) and ending with Bektas? expressions, such as miskinlik etmek (assume humility) or niy?z102, express forms of homage which may equally have the character of acceptance of vassalage or service. 92 See note 85. 93 See note 75a. 94 See note 85. 95 Sapolyo 85?-4. 96 Gr?nwedel fig. 621.

Before viewing some sedent postures of homage, we will briefly recapitulate the gestures of hands, feet or head which generally accompany them, a) The invocatory mudra (Buddhist conventional positions of the hands) are called tamga 108 (seal) in Buddhist Turkish texts. We will not attempt the repetition of this well-known subject but merely remark that such gestures existed also in non Buddhist context. Belenitskiy104 remarked on the murals of Pang-kend the gesture of raising the forefinger in some ritual significance. In Islamic symbolism, this gesture indicated, in the same period, the pronunciation of the confession of faith105. One cannot but recall that the painting dates from the Islamic age of Transoxiana. 103 A. Caferoglu, Uygur s?zl?g? (Istanbul 1934) entry tamga. ?hivopis pl. XVI. 106 al-Azraqi, . al-ahb?r makka, ed.

After Kotwicz-Samoilovitch The Yesevi106 and Qizilbas107 orders had several symbolic gestures which the latter designated with the term miihr, the persian translation of the turkish tamga (mudra). The Qizilbas miihr include the act of raising the forefinger, when offering the mystic cup of wine. In the beginning of the ceremony of initiation the Qizilbas postulant stands at the esik (threshold), imitating with the hand the Arabic letter l?m which denotes negation (of wordly concern). b) The act of raising one's glass to the breast, before drinking it, is known since the sixth century to denote homage and the vow of fidelity (and)108. c) To dip weapons in wine (Hsiung-nu), or to draw weapons (Qirgiz, Yabaqu)109 or to touch one's blade (attested in the Ottoman period)110 often accompanied the and (vow of fidelity). 106 a Yesev? dervish saluted by laying- down the hack of the left hand and curving his right arm in the form of a circle (a cakra?) on his own back.

Since the G?k-T?rk petroglyphs and the Uygur murals, down to the Ottoman period, the attendant took care to hide his hands in long sleeves (fig. 1 ). The same precaution was taken by the donor who raised the cultural image (fig. 1 ). The H?q?nid texts111 specify that the right hand should be folded over the left. The Yesev? and Bektas? postulant112 stood at the esik (threshold) of the convent with his arms crossed over the breast, touching his shoulders with opposite hands. In older usage, the postulant held the left ear with the right hand. e) In what concerns the position of the feet, when expressing homage, Y?suf H?ss H?gib merely enjoinsto bring "the feet in order" 113. The Yesev? or Bektas? postulant, when he stood at the d?rlu (station of the tree), ready to be metaphori cally hanged, adopted the position called peymance durmaq110, placing the right toe over the left. f) The G?k-T?rk petroglyph representing T?rk Bilge Qagan and his pair of "wise kings" (fig. 7)116 show the latter with lowered heads117. The gesture of looking down wards, in sign of respect, is also recommended in Kutadgu-bilig118. The Bektas? texts interpret this gesture as laying down one's head in stake119. While he lowered his head, a rope was passed around the neck of the Bektas? or Qizilbas postulant who was presented to the baba or the dede (superior) as a sacrificial ram120. The postulant wras later girdled with this rope to which a sword was said to be attached. 2. The prostration It has been mentioned in part II that the Hunnic prince Kin-yi-ti was represented prostrate before the golden statue which had been worshipped by his ancestors. The gesture appears in a Buddhist context in the Central Asian Turkish period. T'ung Yabgu expressed through prostration his Buddhist faith121. The Uygur murals represent the same gesture122.

The gesture of kissing the threshold, or some part of the honoured person, such as the shoulder, the knee, the feet, the hem of the gown126 or the sash127 was mimicked through extenduing the hand towards that direction and bringing it back, first to the mouth, then to the forehead. This gesture, called tentenna in Ottoman Turkey, which apparently also existed at the Indian court of a prince of Turkish culture, the Niz?m of Hyderabad, has been compared by Altheim to the Graeco-Persian proskynesis128. 5. The genuflexion The verb ?kmek129 (descend) occurs in an invocatory G?k-T?rk text. In the forms c?k?tmek1^0 (Uygur) and s?kmek (H?q?nid)131 it signified homage through genu flexion. The act of genuflexion was combined with that of raising the glass of wine by K'imin, a puppet G?k-T?rk Qagan in 587, in the presence of the Chinese emperor Yang-ti132. a) Genuflexion with one knee One could kneel on one or both knees. A Parthian prince expressed homage to the Roman Emperor Nero by bending one knee133. The gesture of bending a single knee is generally observed in princely effigies. The statue attributed to K?l-Tigin by Kotwicz (fig. 22) is represented in that posture and seems to clutch a decanter (The office of serving wine to the Qagan was reserved to the ranking prince of the blood). It is again on one knee that a warrior (fig. 23) described on one occasion as a tarqan (the inscription may be a later addition) in* the pranidhi scenes of the Uygur murals at Bezeklik (ninth to twelfth century). The Timurid genealogies134 with Uygur inscriptions show the minor princes, bending the knee and brandishing weapons (fig. 24). Alan Kova, the ancestress of the Mongol dynasty kneels in front of the semi-astral, semi-canine genie of whom she bore illustrious sons (fig. 25). 126 N?zhet, glossary, entry niy?z.

See painting described in Note 83 where the Janissaries kiss the hem of Selim IPs gown. 127 In later times, instead of kissing the hem of the Sultan's gown (he now wore European Trousers), a sash was extended beside the throne which the visitors saluted, in mimicry of the act of kissing it. 128 F.

Haenisch, Die Geheime Ge schichte der Mongolen (Leipzig 1948) 3]</page><page sequence="29">Oldrug?T?riig, The Hierarchy of Sedent Postures in Turkish Iconography 29 In Qizflbas ceremonies, as in the case of the statue with decanter attributed by Kotwicz to K?l Tigin, the cup-bearer bends the knee while offering wine135. The postulant to the Qizilbas community and his "witness" bend the knee, side by side at the e?ik (threshold) as they present the sacrificial ram. The "witness" bends with the left knee in vertical position while the postulant affects the same gesture with the right knee136. In Turkish villages, to sit in a position of genuflexion, bending one knee is con sidered appropriate for personages of secondary rank. According to Prof. Rintchen's testimony, in Mongol conventions, to bend one knee expresses readiness to service. b) Genuflexion with both knees On the Altaic petroglyph (fig. 6) of the fifth to sixth centuries the worshippers of Umay have fallen down on both knees before the Turkish mother-goddess. Y?suf Hass H?gib137 defined, in 1068, the act of kneeling on both knees, as a sign of humi lity: "Kneel on both knees. Be humble." The donors (ill. 1) and persons of comparatively menial station are shown kneeling on both knees in Uygur art. The attendant in Kutadgu-bilig, who had some state ment to make, kneels down and lets both arms fall to the sides instead of folding them on the breast, as generally done. The Bektas? niy?zlzs may also consist in kneeling w^hile kissing the baba*s knees or the four cross-axially placed thresholds. Genuflexion on both knees, as a habitual posture, is the expression of a low station in the communal order. This lengthy dissertation on questions of protocole should perhaps be ended with Y?suf H?ss H?gib's remark139 on the futility of such conventions: "All honour is due to wisdom. It matters not if its worldly station is the t?r or the qapiig" 155 Sapolyo 516. 136 Sapolyo 261. 137 Kutadgu-bilig, couplet 4058. 138 Niizhet, glossary Niy?z, Kiok mak?m. 133 Kutadgu-bilig, couplet 264 : Biligke turur bu agirlik kamug.
