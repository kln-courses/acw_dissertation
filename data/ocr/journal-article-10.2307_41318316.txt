<plain_text><page sequence="1">B.A. SPARKES BLACK PERSEUS Since the beginning of this century research on Greek vase- painting in all its aspects has flourished, and it is not too much to say that knowledge of the subject has been revolutionised. Attention has naturally been concentrated in the first instance on the actual paintings, but more recently, in view of the dimin- ishing returns from a well-tilled field, interest has turned to a study of the vases and their shapes. This work has embraced not only those vases which carry figured scenes or decorative pat- The substance of this article was delivered first as a lecture at the Annual General Meeting of the Classical Association in Reading, April 1967. 1 wish to thank the following museums for permission to publish the vases shown on Pis. 1-8: Athens, National Museum; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts; Brussels, Musses Royaux d'art et d'histoire; Geneva, Mus£e d'art et d'his- toire; London, British Museum; Naples, National Museum; New York, Metropolitan Museum; Newcastle, University Museum; Oxford, Ash- molean Museum; Paris, Louvre; S&amp;vres, Musde national de cdramique; Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum; Yale, University Art Gallery. The following scholars have given me much valuable assistance with prob- lems contained here, for which I thank them: Jean Baity; Ann Birchall; Hector Catling; Peter Corbett; Lilly Kahil; Giuliana Riccioni; Martin Ro- bertson; Brian Shefton. The Managing Committee of the British School at Athens kindly gave me permission to republish the fragment from Pera- chora. The British Academy supplied me with a fellowship to visit European Museums in 1964, and it was during that tour that I was able to study the Brussels kantharos. One debt of gratitude is still unsaid, the thanks I owe to Lucy Talcott, from whom I have learned all I know of black-glazed pottery and much else besides. This short study is offered to a colleague with whom work over the past ten years has been a constant delight.

Such a study seeks to establish the stages through which the shapes develop and also tries to connect together vases which are of the same date and thus form an idea of the output of particular workshops. Potters do not reveal themselves as clearly as painters, for Greek techniques of potting are more stereotyped than those of paint- ing, they are less revealing in their details, and the rigorous finishing the vases underwent removed most of the personal touches one might hope to find. Tracing the hand of one potter for a particular shape is comparatively easy, as the points of comparison - shape of foot, form of handles, set of lip - are present; attempting to distinguish a potter for two or more shapes is decidedly more difficult, as the points of contact are generally lost. Sometimes when the shape has figured designs, the painter will sign for the potter, or the painter is also the potter and signs as both. Even where the signature is not to be found, the fact that vases can be grouped together from the point of view of the painting will indicate something about the connections in potting. The group of black vases under con- sideration here reveals their associations in a slightly different way. In the middle of the fifth century B.C., a type of decoration was created in the pottery shops of Athens which consisted of incising patterns of lines, with ruler and compasses, on the flat floor of stemless cups, whilst the clay was still wet and the cups as yet unglazed; the cups were then glazed and fired. In the first years the decoration was confined to one shape of broad, shallow stemless cup and used in conjunction with red-figure : the incised design on the inside of the cup, the red-figured decoration out- side1. However, the incised decoration was soon used by itself on this shape of stemless, the outside of the cup being completely glazed. After 450 B.C. the decoration was developed in two directions. Stamped motifs were introduced into the incised design by the use of small clay stamps which carried on them a decorative pattern raised in relief. These stamps were pressed into the wet clay, causing the designs to sink below the sur- rounding area. The designs employed were mainly the floral palmette but also the rarer forms such as the lotus, meander and ivy. Plate i2 shows a stemless cup of the shape originally used, 1 See JHS 56, 1936, 205-215 andpls.11-13 (A.D.Ure). 3 London BM 64. 10-7.1591 (Fikellura grave 3 9 bis). 3</page><page sequence="2">and the interior is decorated with stamped palmettes and ivy with berries. The date of this cup is about 450-40 B.C. The second way in which the decoration was developed was in its application to a greater range of vases, not only different varie- ties of stemless cup and other open shapes but also to deeper, narrower shapes, such as the mug, lekythos, kantharos and amphoriskos3. In these instances the patterns were impressed on the outside wall. So in the years from 450 B.C. onwards when black-figure was almost extinct and red-figure was losing its strength and vitality, the technique of incising and stamping was more widely em- ployed than before, and a greater variety of patterns was created. One workshop at this time tried an ambitious experiment and introduced an even more elaborate scheme: impressed figures in place of the more usual floral design. Five such black vases are known, and although they have been mentioned before together, they are usually misdated to the fourth century, have not been studied as a group and deserve to be more widely known4. The five vases are as follows: A. Kantharos ('Perseus shape', see below) 1. Boston 01.8023, from the Bourguignon collection, Naples: L.D.

The handles consist of two rolls of clay which are laid side by side and part at the mouth, running a little way along the rim: double handles with shouldering. There are two grooves in the outer face of the foot. Reserved areas are the resting surface and underside of the foot with two circles of glaze and a central circle and dot. 3 For work on black-glazed vases with impressed and incised decoration, see particularly Hesperia 4, 1935, 481-492 (L.Talcott); JHS 64, 1944, 67-77 (A.D.Ure); Hesperia 18, 1949, 298-351 (P. E. Corbett) and Hesperia 24, 1955, 172-186 (P. E. Corbett). 4 Various dates have been assigned to the vases, all later than their true date. A. Merlin in Melanges Gustave Glotz 2 (1932) 604, puts them in the fourth century. Schauenburg, Perseus 46, also dates them in the fourth century. Beckel, Gotterbeistand 134, dates them to the second half of the fourth cen- tury, calls them relief vases and speaks (3 5) of a new roll for Athena in fourth century stamped vases. Schiering 174 and 180 refers to London G90 (Bi below) as ca. 400 B. C. C.M. Robertson in his review of Beckel in JHS 84, 1964, 225, rightly emphasises a fifth century date. 5 Fig. 1 is taken from Caskey, Geometry and fig. 2 is the same drawing that is to be found in Fairbanks. 4</page><page sequence="3">The impressed decoration consists of a border of ovules just below the junction of neck and body, and below the main scene a border of meander edged above by one incised line, below by three. The main scene comprises on side A : at left a column with Ionic capital and sphinx above facing left, Athena at right of the column facing Hermes who approaches followed by Perseus; at the right of the scene is a similar column with sphinx also facing left. On side B the picture is once more framed by the sphinx columns and between there are the two Gorgons running to left and at the right Medusa, beheaded, sinking to the ground. Above her flies Pegasus and by her side the baby Chrysaor kneels at the foot of the column. Details of the figures are discussed below. 2. Brussels inv.

The im- pressed decoration is very close to that of A 1, differing only in a few details. The lower border of the figured scene is not one of meanders but of sloping double palmettes linked by spirals ; the upper palmette of the two is smaller than the lower. The other main point of difference is that the left hand sphinx column on side A has been replaced by a wall of feathers, six wings in all. One small point is that the light ridge which separates the neck from the body is notched on the Brussels kantharos, plain on the Boston. The workmanship is less good here than on the Boston kantharos. Details of the figures are discussed below. B. Mug (Theidias shape', see below) 1 .

The meanders are impressed singly, and there is a small space under the handle which indicates the start and finish of the stamping. The other major difference is that the vase has only one handle, so the scene is continuous and two of the sphinx columns are missing. There is a broad groove just above the lower edge of the wall.

Now it is time to consider the vases in more detail, and three approaches will be made : first by studying the shape of each vase, secondly by considering the technique and character of the stamping, thirdly by placing the treatment of this episode of the Perseus story in its iconographical context. Shapes The two kantharoi, Ai and A 2, to which the name 'Perseus shape' has been thought appropriate from the impressed scene they carry, were doubtless made as a pair, so closely do they concur in measurements and details of potting and reserving: the general proportions, the elaborate shape of the foot with its grooved edge, the type and set of the handles, the decoration of the underside. The shape is not common; its origins have been sketched by Beazley8. The shape must ultimately go back to the Amasis painter's mastos in the Louvre (PL 4 , /)?, a century earlier. The proportions are different, the earlier vase is more slender with narrower, simpler foot and smaller, more jutting 8 Beazley VPol 70-71, note 8 ; CVA Oxford 2 (9) text to pl. 65 (429) 4. 9 Paris, Louvre F 70, from Vulci : E. Pottier, Vases antiques du Louvre (1 901) pl. 69; Beazley ABV 156, 76. 6</page><page sequence="5">lip ; the handles also are differently set, lower down the body and not reaching the mouth. But the elements of the later cup are there. The line of descent from here is not pure, and the shape never became a firm favourite and was thus open to constant innovation. The more common, handled mastoids10 are not far from the shape, and some one-handled mugs of the early fifth century are related to the same tradition11. The shape at this date is in many ways simpler than the impressed pieces : plain foot and strap handle, but the curve of the bowl and the slightly offset lip in these early fifth century mugs point to the Terseus shape' quite clearly. In the second quarter of the fifth century, such a piece as the Vienna kantharos (PL 4, 2) 12 is a more imme- diate ancestor of the Terseus shape' and provides a link between the one-handled mugs and the impressed examples. The lip of the Vienna kantharos is pronounced and more strongly offset from the body. The foot, though similar in shape to earlier pieces, and like them reserved in its outer face, has a slight groove at the upper edge, and this perhaps points to the profiled foot of the later shape. Also, the decoration of the underside is closer to the later decoration. Of similar date and shape are some black vases from Certosa13. The Oxford kantharos (PL 4, f) 14 of the middle of the century is one step nearer to the Terseus shape'. In outline it is barely distinguishable from the stamped kantharoi but has plain handles and simple foot, now glazed black. The handles do not reach the mouth but are attached a little below the lip. Only the flat band handle may be attached directly to the rim, as on the Vienna kantharos (PL 4 , 2), unless the potter uses the expedient of doubling the handles into two rolls, parting them at the top and running them along the mouth of the vase. This is a common practice on certain shapes from the third quarter of the fifth century onwards, and, as noted above (p. 4), it is the procedure that was adopted for the Terseus shape' and for the British Museum mug, B 1. The connection of the one-handled mugs as the British Museum example (PL 3) and the kantharoi of Terseus shape' is further indicated by the raised ridge at the junction of neck and body. The ridge is usually notched on the one-handled mugs, though actually there is no notching on the British Museum piece; the Brussels kantharos, A 2, however, does have the notching. The distinct foot of the Terseus shape' is to be connected with the other shape of kantharos bearing stamped figures, C 1 (PL 2, 4). The date of the Boston and Brussels vases is about 430 B.C. We may follow the Terseus shape' a little further. In the precise form in which we have it here it has little further history1^ It has few direct descendants in Attic black, but a similar vase in Sevres (PL 4, 4) 16 , which from the photograph may be Attic, takes the shape a little further, having a high flaring foot and a vertically ribbed body, with hanging linked palmettes and lotus stamped on the shoulder, and a lotus stamped at the end of each projection of the handles at the rim. The date of the piece is still well within the fifth century. There are no other black-glazed vases which continue the shape in Attic, but a class of red-figured vases produced in the late fifth and early fourth centuries in Athens is related to the Terseus shape' (PL /, /)l8. There are differences, naturally: the foot is less elaborate and the lip is narrower and more sharply outturned. A connection however is established by the general shape of the body and particularly by the position and form of the handles. They are vertical and 10 SeeBeazleyABV 5 57-560. 613. 614-615.648-649. 707. 708. 711. 713. Also pertinent is the footed mastoid in Berlin V. I. 3221. 11 E.g.

Also of interest is a similar kantharos recently found in the Kerameikos (HS 95), red-figured, by the Epidromos painter, showing the judgement of Paris. It is late sixth century and may provide a further link. I am grateful to Dr. K. Vierneisel, who is to publish this vase, for knowledge of it. It is two-handled and has a convex lip. 13 Mentioned by Beazley VPol 70-71, note 8. E.g. A.Zannoni, Gli Scavi della Certosa di Bologna (1876) pls. 14. 15. 17. 20 etc. There is a certain amount of variety in the pieces, some look very rough. 14 Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1928.32: CVA 2(9) pl. 65 (429) 4.

Beazley (CVA Oxford 2 p. 1 17) remarks on the similarity between the foot and handles of the Oxford kantharos and those of the Shape B skyphos ('owl' skyphos). Such a close similarity should indicate that the shapes were made in the same workshop ; the curve of the bowl is close too. 15 For some kantharoi which vary the proportions of the shape and cannot be closely connected with the 'Perseus shape* workshop, see London BM 64.10-7.1 579 (Fikellura grave 245) and 49.5-21.6 and Munich 2921 (= inv. »4J 5)- 10 S&amp;vres inv. 21 5 : CVA (13) pl. 50 (579) 34. 1 know the vase only from a photograph. 17 On these vases, see Beazley VPol 70-71 and Beazley ARV* 1360-1362. 18 Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1 95 8. 1 1 : Ashmolean Report for 1958, pl. 6 a; Archaeological Reports for 1960-61, 57, fig. 9; Beazley ARV3 1 167, 121, the painter of Munich 2335 and Beazley ARV8 1361, 3, the class of Bonn 94. 7</page><page sequence="6">double-rolled as before, but the taste of the time and the inclina- tion of the potter have raised them above the mouth, and they have relief heads applied to their attachment with the rim. On PL /, / the heads are those of satyrs, occasionally negro heads are also applied. This variation of shape is copied by South Italian potters, and a pair of red-figured vases of this shape20, one in Taranto, gives the Perseus myth in an abbreviated form. The South Italian kantharos in Taranto is from Ceglie, and a number of Attic kantharoi from which it was derived, were found in that part of South Italy; the majority of those whose pro- venience is known are from Ruvo, and there are three in Bari, presumably from nearby21. That the shape was undoubtedly popular in South Italy is shown also by a further series which has stronger claims to be associated with the Attic class. This shape of vase (e.g. PL j,2 )22 is common in Apulia and appears at the end of the fifth century23. Apart from two elaborate pieces24, the vases are small, at most ca. o. 1 3 m. high, usually only 0.06 m. ; they carry added paint on a completely glazed surface in scroll, herringbone, meander and zigzag patterns. There are also heads at the base of the handles on some. A few which do not belong to the group but have a similar shape, of which Plate j,j2$ is an example, have a ribbed lower body, a pattern of added leaves painted on the black on the shoulder and relief heads at the base of the handles. In both series it is quite possible that the relief heads copy at a distance the relief heads on the Attic class and its associates. Again, the provenience of one of the related group is Ceglie, and the date must be early fourth century. An even later development of the same shape is to be seen in Sevres26, where the body is slimmer, the handles more bent and the mouth nar- rower. A further step yet is taken on Plate /, ^27, found in Boeo- tia. Here the technique of Hellenistic mould-made wares has been used for the bowl, and a top and base have been added to the basic shape of the bowl. The handles are double-rolled with plastic attachments above. The date is late second century, the work Greek. Now that we have set the 'Perseus shape' in some sort of chrono- logical context, it is time to turn our attention to the British Museum mug, B 1 . Of the three shapes of mug listed by Beazley 28 in red-figure, Shape 8 A is mainly confined to one shop and one painter: the painter of Berlin 2268 (Beazley ARV2 156-158); Plate 6 , j29 gives a fair idea of the shape and of the run-of-the- mill character of the figure painting. Shape 8 C is not a common Attic shape, either in figured or in black, and Plate 6,2 30 again gives a notion of the shape; perhaps the lack of articulation accounts in part for its unpopularity. It is however Shape 8 B, a variation, doubtless, of Shape 8 A, that is of interest in the present enquiry. Again, it is not common in red-figure, the size and shape to cover did not allow much scope : usually one or two figures only. In black, however, this variety of mug is one of the most popular of all small closed shapes in the second half of the fifth century31. The representations show its uses as a soldiers' or travellers' mug, serving a number of purposes: drinking, libation, measuring, ladling32. Plate 6 , 5 and 4 show two ex- 19 The relief heads may come from metal, but not necessarily.

The precise connection between the two shapes is not yet clear ; it is possible that, with the nestoris already established in popularity, the small late fifth century kantharoi were assured of a wel- come. The popularity of the shape is then reflected in two sizes of vase. 22 Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1945.67: Beazley EVP 219, no. 5 bis. 23 See A.

The standard type has a squat body, concave lip and double-rolled handle with shouldering 35. The low foot in Attic is at first flat, or slightly concave, and reserved with a central circle of glaze; a more popular alternative was soon adopted with underside inset, sometimes with a concave moulding at the join of the foot and floor beneath. It is this inset foot which the British Museum mug, B i, carries. As can be seen on Plate 6 , 4 , the vertical ribbing of the standard mug is enlivened above and below by palmettes and circles, and beneath the handle by an elaborate palmette design below ovules. The vertical ribbing and the form of the double handle establish a connection with metal work, and the correspondence between the standard clay ex- amples and metal mugs is amazingly close36. The black clay version has in recent years become very well known, as it was on such a shape that the signature of Pheidias was found at Olympia3?. 4&gt;EIAIOI EIMI is neatly and clearly written across the bottom of the mug, and scholars have been quick to admire the neatness of Pheidias' hand, as though artistic genius and good handwriting were somehow linked: an unwarranted assump- tion. This is not the place, however, to consider the authenticity of the inscription; the name is useful as being immediately re- cognizable. In Attica, the shape was in production from the middle of the fifth century to the early fourth. During that time the proportions of the mug changed from fat and round to more slender and straight. The British Museum mug, B i, fits best into this development around the years 440-430 B.C. The shape, as with the 'Perseus shape', is borrowed by South Italian potters, and a great variety both in red-figure and in black glaze is created there. Of the different types of fifth century kantharoi38, the sessile kantharos with low handles, as C 1 and C 2, is the least elegant in shape, the most practical for handling. It is for this latter reason the commonest of black kantharoi, and is most popular with impressed decoration on the upper wall39. Most of such pieces belong to the third quarter of the fifth century, and it has only a little earlier history. The shape was created perhaps a little after 480 B.C., when many were decorated with patterns in added white on a black background, a class which Beazley has dubbed 'St. Valentin'40. The decoration usually consists of feathers, leaves, chequerboard etc., as on Plate 7,/41. In the second quarter of the fifth century, the shape is less well articulated than later, but the lack of shape is to a large extent masked by the gaiety of the colour and design. A few of this period are plain black42 or red-figured, as Plate 7,243; here the rather formless outline is not hidden from view. After the middle of the century, the shape was altered, the outline was stiffened, and more articu- lation was given to the individual members, and stamped motifs were introduced instead of the figured and patterned designs, Plate 7,^44. The foot also was elaborated, with two grooves set 33 Yale, University Art Gallery 1913.409. 34 Yale, University Art Gallery 1913.474. 35 On the earliest examples of this shape the handle is a flat strap, as the handles of the kantharoi which preceded the 'Perseus shape'. 36 This is very well seen in Schiering, 1 72, figs. 46 and 47 (bronze and silver). 175, fig. 50 (= fig.47). 175, fig. 5 1 (terracotta). 180, figs. 55-56 (terracotta) and 181, fig. 57, right (terracotta). 37 Olympia, from Olympia: Neue deutsche Ausgrabungen im Mittelmeer- gebiet und im vorderen Orient (1959) 309,fig.44; AJA63, 1959, pl.75,figs. 9-10; BCH 83, 1959, pl. 33; Archaeology 12, 1959, 137; Olympiabericht 7, 1961, 16-17, figs* 8~9i Schiering pl. 64 and fig. 45, 1.

The potter would seem to be the same man who created the 'Perseus shape'. Occasionally he leaves the underside reserved, more often it is glazed black. The Agora excavations have turned up whole and fragmentary black kantharoi of this shape with stamped patterns, and a study of these finds indicates that the shape was short-lived, at the latest going down to 420 B.C.4*. The Newcastle kantharos, Ci, does not belong to the end of this development, and again a date around 430 B.C. is perhaps right. As before, what the Attic potters discarded the South Italian workshops took up and used, and it is interesting in this connection to note that the very work- shop in Apulia - the Xenon group - which in the later fifth century produced vases allied to the class of Bonn 94 (see above p. 7, 18), also issued imitations of the Saint Valentin class46, and another imitator 47 produced a slightly different version with grooved foot and shallow cul which seems to copy the impressed version more closely (/V.7,4)48. However, with the Saint Va- lentin shape, the proveniences of the Attic versions are not normally in the South of Italy, for many Saint Valentins come from Bologna, and only a few are known to have been found in Apulia. Decoration We have now seen something of the development of the three shapes, and it has been suggested that the group of five vases was made some time between 440 and 430 B.C. and that various details connect them together. If not all made by the same potter, they were undoubtedly made in the same workshop. Should an order be demanded, the mug, B 1, is perhaps the earliest of the five, the Boston and Brussels kantharoi, A 1 and A 2, next and the Newcastle kantharos, Ci, last4?. Now it is time to consider the technique and appearance of the decoration. Here there is obviously a further workshop connection, for the Boston and Brussels kantharoi and the British Museum mug carry the same scene, the composition of which was for the most part created with the same set of stamps, and it is extremely probable that despite the differences in the scenes on the Newcastle and Pera- chora kantharoi, the very use of figure stamps on them should, in view of the extreme rarity of the practice, establish a workshop connection with the other three. Let us look at the figures on the British Museum mug, B 1, in detail {PI. 8, 1-3). The upper border of the scene is a row of ovules, below there is a row of meanders, impressed singly, with a groove above and below. On the left edge of the scene we have a column topped by a sphinx, facing left. The capital is Ionic and the three flutes have been scored individually with a stick. To the right of this stands Athena, facing right, her left leg slightly forward and bent at the knee. Her aegis with its Gorgoneion is seen in front view; she is dressed in a long chiton, and her hair is tied in a knot at the back. She holds a spear behind her in her right hand. In front of her hastening up we have a beardless Hermes, with winged hat, winged boots 5°, caduceus in his left hand and wearing a short cloak or chlamys. Behind him comes Perseus himself, beardless also, with winged boots but no hat, and carrying in his left hand the curved harpe with which he has just decapitated Medusa, and in his right, clutched to his chest 5 x, the kibisis in which we are to imagine the Gorgon's head 5*. Perseus wears a short chiton. The Gorgons who pursue Perseus wear short chitons too ; they are winged and have streaming hair. They are not unlovely, the only concession to their true natures being the snake in their right hands. At the right edge of the scene we see the decapitated Medusa sinking to the ground, kneeling on her left knee. The neck protrudes and is flat above : a clean break. Medusa is winged like her sisters and wears the usual short chiton. At her death she gave birth; her offspring are shown above and beside her, Pegasus above, already trying his wings in flight to the left, Chrysaor to Medusa's left, a small naked child facing front, barely a few seconds old, one would 45 Of interest here is the silver one-handled 'kantharos* from Melitopol (Solokha): RA23, 1914, 164fF.andpl.9j Strong Plate, pl.i6B. Though hav- ing only one handle, it is basically the same shape as the clay versions under discussion. 46 Beazley EVP 219; F.P.Johnson, The Farwell Collection (1953) 58-59. 47 Beazley EVP 221-222. 48 London BM 47.8-6.48: CVA 7 (10) pl. 4 (479) 2. 49 The superior quality of the Perachora fragment might speak for a date earlier than that of the Newcastle kantharos, but this is not necessarily so. 50 It might be more accurate to speak of wings at his heels and lines across the ankles, for there is no actual evidence for the boots. The same applies to Perseus. 51 This detail was not noticed by Walters in his description of the British Museum mug in BM Cat. Vases 4 (1896) 250. 51 There are some scarcely visible protrusions above the top edge of the kibisis, and these were doubtless meant to indicate hair. For similar indica- tions, cf. e.g. New York 06.1070: see note 76 below. 10</page><page sequence="9">assume, but already precociously kneeling and looking about him - this of course is not unusual for divine infants. The crafts- man has managed to create quite a believable child, not a manni- kin merely as earlier artists did53. The scene is closed at the right by the sphinx column. The elements out of which the figures were made can be clearly seen. Each part of the figures is a separate impression: the arms, the legs, the clothing, etc., and a single stamp for each part was used over and over again. This means that Medusa, for instance, though falling, has the same stamp for her chiton as her sisters and Perseus, though now it is set at an angle. The kneeling back leg of Medusa is the same leg that we see, both right and left, on every running figure, just as it is the same as Medusa's front leg. One pair of wings also does duty for all three Gorgons. A glance at the drawing of the Boston figures {Fig, 2) shows the whole scene, and we can see that exactly the same stamps are used for the majority of the details as were used on the British Museum mug, Bi. There are a few differences, however, between the British Museum and the Boston versions. The British Museum scene is continuous, the Boston (and the Brussels) scene is di- vided into two. This was necessary in view of the handles, but the division was accentuated by the columns which are now four in number. It would seem logical to suppose that the scene was originally conceived for the mug, and the mug seems to be slightly earlier than the Boston and Brussels kantharoi from the point of view of shape (see above p. 9). The meander below the Boston scene is less fine than the British Museum pattern, sim- pler also. In the scene itself the Gorgon sisters' heads are not made with the same stamp as on the British Museum piece ; their hair is not swept back but comes forward to frame their faces. The Brussels kantharos (Fig. 3) again alters some of the details, though the stamps used for the figures are identical with the Boston version. It omits the extra columns which divided the scene on the Boston kantharos and for the column behind Athena substitutes three pairs of wings. Too much meaning need not be read into them. A. B.Cook 54 tries with a heavy hand to make them meaningful: "Perseus had been fitted out by the Nymphs with wings on head and foot, and these presuppose a divine store-house of such things.' I see no need to conjure up a celestial hangar; the stamps were to hand, and the craftsman varied his frame. The upper border has the usual ovule pattern, below there is a change ; sloping double palmettes linked by spirals replace the meander. This is one of the most elaborate stamped pal- mettes ever made and was obviously modelled on a contempo- rary red-figured pattern. Sloping double palmettes are found as early as the Late Archaic period in red-figure55 but are not com- mon then; they gain in popularity in the middle of the century in the workshop of the Niobid painter56. This comparison raises the question of comparisons of style with other media for the figures. What few points of contact there are (e. g. the head of Perseus) 57 would corroborate a date around 440-430 B. C. The scenes on the Newcastle and Perachora kantharoi are sim- pler. Newcastle (PL $, 4) has a row of horses galloping to the right above two grooves from which hang boxed triangles. The horse is not unlike Pegasus and could with the addition of a wing double for him in another scene. The Perachora fragment (PL 8y /) has preserved on it a lion facing left above hanging boxed triangles, more neatly done than the Newcastle triangles. The latter design58, found on both these pieces, is exclusive to this particular shape of kantharos, and hence acts as a connecting link for the fragment, establishing its shape beyond doubt. The lion might suggest a lost Heracles further to the left, and indeed there are a number of elements which raise the question of other scenes which were probably done in this technique. It is natural to think that the sphinx on a column, here used merely as a decorative edge to the scenes, was originally conceived as part of an Oedipus composition. Lions and horses might be asso- ciated with a number of mythological characters, and Athena and Hermes would always be a useful adjunct to any hero scene. The frontal aegis allows a frontal Athena, and most likely a left- 53 For a fairly dose parallel in red-figure, see the slightly earlier pyxis from Aiolou Street, Athens: Arch.Deltion 18, 1963, Chr. 1, pl. 33.

Wiirzburg 511 : Beazley ARV3 604, 47; Leningrad: Beazley ARVJ 606, 72, both by the Niobid painter. In the majority of cases the slope of the palmettes is in a SW to NE direction (for an exception, see Wiirzburg 510: Beazley ARV* 296, top), whereas on our kantharos the slope is from NW to SE. 57 P. E. Corbett suggests Myron as a near parallel for this head. 58 The boxed triangles are common as decoration on Corinthian mould- made wares of the sixth century, and the inspiration may have come from there with the imports of Corinthian material of this sort. See Hesperia 23, 1 $54, 127-128 and pls. 28-29 (S.Weinberg); Agora 12. II</page><page sequence="10">facing Athena too. If the baby Chrysaor were centred and a snake put into each hand, the beginning of a composition show- ing Heracles strangling serpents is created. It is merely a case of gathering the elements together, shuffling and redealing. More examples of vases with impressed figures will appear in time, as the skill needed to create the original mould for the stamps and the time taken in the actual process of making the impressions on the vases would hardly been confined to a handful of vases and then be discarded 59. However, it is unlikely that such finds will belong much later than the period of these five, and certainly not any earlier. The use of figure compositions no doubt followed the engraving of silver vases with figured scenes which began in the middle of the fifth century60. The reason for saying that further scenes are not likely to be much later in date than those we have here will be discussed below (p. 1 3 f.). Theme It is not necessary to enter into the iconography of the Perseus legend here, and two recent studies make it superfluous61. Dif- ferent aspects of the Perseus story attracted artists at different times; the Chase and the side issue of the Birth of Pegasus and Chrysaor are all that concern us here, and of these it well be mainly Attic renderings on which concentration will be focused. The Chase is represented early in Attic62 ; it makes a good action picture with the figures arranged neatly in a convenient line. The earliest representation is on the Eleusis amphora 63 of ca. 660 B. C. Medusa is headless at the side in a flowery meadow, Perseus is over on the right and is already provided with winged boots64. The upper part of him is missing, so it is not possible to tell whether he was wearing the winged cap and carrying the harpe, though there do seem to be some traces of the bottom edge of the kibisis preserved. The two sisters are not yet tradi- tional, as they wear long dresses and have no wings. Athena is unwarlike in appearance, as usual in Attic seventh century art. Totfind her here at all is startling, for she has no part in Hesiod's version of the tale and had originally nothing to do with the story of the Argive hero, but with the backing of Athenian propaganda she is here to stay. So by the middle of the seventh century we have Perseus, Medusa and her two sisters, and Athena. Before the end of the seventh century, Hermes has become part of the cast and takes his place by Athena's side. On a fragment by the Nessos painter6*, his presence is guaranteed by a mere foot, for this is who it must be, turned, as was Athena on the Eleusis amphora, to face the Gorgons, whilst Athena, still a peaceful figure, speeds Perseus on his way. The complete figure of Perseus now shows him to have winged boots, cap, kibisis, and a straight sword at his back, and he is bearded. Hesiod's phrase S d'dig re vdrjfi9 inoTOLTO (Scut. 222) aptly suits the representation. Early in the sixth century, a kylix by the C painter 66 shows the chase in full swing. There is no brave Hermes now turning to face the Gor- gons, no Athena standing and letting Perseus escape. All three hot foot it away : such is the fate of anthropomorphic gods. Perseus wears a white hat and dappled skin, and carries the straight sword and kibisis at his back ; Athena has been well described6? as "lum- bering along, rather hampered by the six great snakes that spring from the fringe of her aegis' ; she is now warlike. The Gorgons are provided with two types of wings : the upcurling archaic type of wings and the down-pointing bird wings which were even- tually to supercede the archaic type - they are, in Payne's phrase, four-winged68. More important is the fact that at the left end of 59 For details of stamping techniques, see Hesperia 24, 1955, 175 (P.E.Cor- bett). 60 Strong Plate 78. 61 Riccioni, Origine e Sviluppo del Gorgoneion e del Mito della Gorgone- Medusa nell'arte Greca, Riv. dell'Istituto nazionale d'archeologia e storia dell 'arte, n.s. 9, i960, 127-206, and Schauenburg, Perseus.

He is the first to include the episode as part of a narrative6*, for the earlier versions of Medusa with Pegasus and Chrysaor?0 show Medusa still with her head and make an allusion to rather than a demonstration of the birth. On the C painter's cup Medusa is shown with Pegasus emerging from her severed neck, and a youth stands between the two running sisters, Chrysaor rather than a spectator?1.

The scene of the chase on both the Eleusis amphora and the C painter's kylix runs from left to right, and this is the canonical direction of the flight. A fragment of a mould-made tripod bowl, dating from the second quarter of the sixth century, was found in 1949 at the Argive Heraion72; it was made at Corinth and has an impressed scene on the rim. The scene shows Perseus being chased by the Gorgons, and the flight runs from right to left. Four figures 73 are concerned in the chase: Hermes, Perseus and the two Gorgon sisters, the latter two repeating the long skirts and the dancing movement of the pair on the Eleusis amphora. The technique of the impression is the exact opposite to that used on the fifth century group we have been studying, for here the scene has been impressed on the wet clay by means of a cylinder on which the scene has been cut in intaglio, so that the figures of the impression are raised in relief from the flat back- ground of the rim. It is in the technique that the solution to the anomaly of the leftward flight lies, for the cylinder would have been cut with the figures moving to right, the traditional direc- tion for the archaic period. In red-figure and in the fifth century Perseus may run to right or left, and a choice of characters was made. The Berlin painter in the early fifth century 74 chooses two only : Perseus and a Gorgon on opposite sides of the amphora they decorate. The painter has them running in the old direction, Perseus still bearded and the Gorgon in pursuit her usual snaky self. A new element, however, is the curved harpe, and a return, if it may be called so, has been made to the long skirt after the short knee-length chiton had been in vogue in the sixth century. The Pan painter on his London hydria75 of ca. 475 B.C. reverses the direction of the chase, so that it now runs from right to left, Perseus is without his beard and holds a curved harpe in his left hand. Medusa's head pro- trudes from the top of the kibisis, and the snakes are absent. Even given the humourous slant which the Pan painter affects, here with the ballet-like movement, the dainty Athena and Medusa sinking operatically down, this painting typifies a new approach to legend, a refusal or inability to render ugliness and monstrous beings. The legend has been sweetened and toned down, effects other than the gruesome are being sought. A closely contempo- rary lekythos by the Diosphos painter 76, which is rendered in black outline and silhouette on a white background, shows the birth episode. We have a leftward running Perseus, harpe in his left hand, kibisis on his right arm with the head of Medusa a black mass with tufts above, as on the impressed versions. On the body of Medusa the artist has kept the old upcurling wings of the archaic period. He has also combined the birth of Pegasus with the flight and has given it equal status. It is one of the most convincing renderings of the birth, but it is not a theme ever seriously taken up in Attic red-figure. Nearer yet to the impressed pieces in time and in arrangement is a slapdash example of black- figure 77 of the years 475-450 B.C. It is painted on a lid and 69 Close in date is a fragment of a Corinthian kratcr, Oxford, Ashmolean Museum G 130.12: NC 132, fig. 46 (no. i47oB);CVA 2(9)pl. 6(389) 26. 70 E. g. the Syracuse relief and the Corfu pediment. 71 See JHS 5, 1884, 240 (Smith); Metropolitan Museum Studies 5, 1934-36, no, no. 62 (J.D.Beazley); Schauenburg, Perseus 44.

We have Athena, Perseus with the kibisis hanging in front spor- ranwise, Hermes, a Gorgon, Pegasus, a headless Medusa, Chrysaor, the other Gorgon sister. They run from right to left, i. e. in a clockwise direction. So we have the same players exactly as on our versions, but in a disorganised dance. As Mrs. Wood- ward says 78, 'the grim legend means nothing to the painter of the pyxis lid; it merely provides him with a number of swift little figures for his design, and Medusa must run with the rest'. One must admit that simultaneous decapitation and parturition must have had an unsettling effect, but this was surely not in the mind of the painter. Poor artists confuse the story or copy the work of better men badly. The whole drawing is an exercise in pattern. The Gorgons wear long chitons and have the old type of wings ; the ugly sisters are ugly no more, except for the artist's lack of care. There is no harpe, and the spears are an intrusion, useless in decapitation, cumbersome in flight. The contrast with our impressed versions is interesting : our Gorgons are dressed for action, Medusa is sinking gracefully down, not running with the rest; the Gorgons have the new wings and ideal features, none resemble the loathsome apparitions of earlier years; a stately Athena is unafraid. The elements of the story now accord with the idealising characteristics of Tericlean' art. But respect for this episode of the story is waning, and interest in the Chase episode in Attic painting fades, giving way to the romance of Andromeda and such marginal episodes as the chest, the Graiai, the moment before decpitation and the petrifaction of Poly- dectes. Where the Chase is represented, the artist is sometimes confused about its meaning, especially so in the case of the late fifth century Boeotian artist who painted the small bf. vase in Boston 79. His falling Medusa and flying Pegasus are remarkably close to the impressed figures, one might almost think that he had them before him. But the rest of the composition is far from traditional. Athena looks as though she is urging Perseus to return to the scene of the crime. There is however not one Perseus but two, carrying fearsome sickles in their right hands and over their left arms not, as one might expect, the dreaded kibisis but pilgrim flasks like normal travellers. On the left a Gorgon sister runs not after Perseus, but to the left, and is met by two marine figures, to judge from their tridents: a doubled Poseidon no doubt, for one remembers that he was Medusa's lover and the father of Pegasus and Chrysaor, and might be thought willing to come to Medusa's aid. The impressed scenes, though less fluid than the medium of paint, are some of the last few sensible attempts at a narrative of the Chase. The importance of the five vases we have been considering is various. The fact and nature of their stamped decoration must primarily be their main claim to our attention. It is however possible to collect together other vases which by their details - proportions, shape of handles, decorative elements - can be shown to stem from this particular shop, and we can thus build up a picture of the different groups of output in black-glazed pottery. A hope was entertained earlier that more vases with impressed figures would be found, but it was also suggested that whatever was found of this particular type would be unlikely to be much later in date than the vases we have considered. One reason for this is to be seen on another black-glazed vase - a cup made at Olympia {PL S, 6 and Fig.?)%0. Besides the black-glaze potteries at Athens, others existed in various parts of Greece: Corinth, Boeotia, etc., just those centres which produced black- figure and red-figure ware. One such pottery-making centre was established at Olympia81, and it served some of the villages in the Peloponnese. A distinctive shape produced at Olympia was the heavy kylix: thick stem, weighty body, sharply bent handles. The floruit of this type seems to have been the late fifth and early fourth centuries82. A fragment from such a kylix was found recently at Vourvoura83 on the border of Laconia {PL 8&gt; 6 and Fig, y ). At the centre of the floor there is an impressed scene within a border of linked palmettes. The palmettes, by Attic comparisons, should be early fourth century, and the date of this fragment cannot be far from that time. The central scene is impressed complete and in relief, thus differing in two essential ways from the Attic group. The club above the head of the left- 78 Woodward 67-68. 79 Boston 5 67: A.

One may recall that Heracles and Theseus fighting Amazons were to be found on the cross-bars of the throne of Zeus at Olympia84, and thus we may have here a local pottery imitating a work of Olympia that was of more than local interest. A figure similar to the Heracles is to be seen on a stucco tondo of Roman date in the Vatican which has been connected with the Heracles on the throne of Zeus8^. It is pos- sible to go further. A silver-gilt relief fragment86, most probably from the interior of a cup, has long been known and has been generally accepted as copying the birth of Aphrodite with at- tendant Eros from the base which supported the throne of Zeus8?. The cup was found at Galaxidi and is usually assigned a late fifth century date. May we then suggest that there was a late fifth century metal industry in Olympia which produced copies of motives from the Zeus statue and that this industry had its humbler counterpart in the pottery shops ? The theory seems to be plausible as well as attractive88. The Vourvoura fragment and the numerous Attic relief askoi8? which begin in the late fifth century and testify to the altered techniques indicate that not long after the period of the Attic stamped figures a new method of enlivening vases was found, the inspiration coming from metal work. It was obviously much simpler and quicker to impress a scene whole, merely by pressing the die into the wet clay. So the more laborious technique was quickly ousted by an easier method, and our group of vases represents a manner of decoration that was only short-lived. 84 Pausanias 5, 1 1,4; J.
