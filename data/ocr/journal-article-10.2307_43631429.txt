<plain_text><page sequence="1">Métamorphose et bestiaire fantastique au moyen âge , études rassemblées par Laurence Harf-Lancner, Collection de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles, 28 (Paris: ENSJF, 1985). 333 pp. F. Fr. 120. This collection of conference papers is prefaced (after the event?) by L. Harf-Lancner, who tries to show the links between them and draw attention to basic and recurring problems (such as conflict between pagan superstition and Christian belief). The greatest unity is in the first three papers of the first part ('Métamorphose et merveille'), which all treat werewolf literature: after a general survey, M. Bacou concludes that ťles histoires de loups-garous substituent souvent à la métamorphose la métaphore de la transgression ou de l'initiation' (p. 47). M. Boivin, concentrating on Giraud de Barri's Topographica Hibernica , draws attention to 'le besoin de "dédouaner" le conte, d'intégrer l'être surnaturel au merveilleux chrétien' (p. 17). C. Oates, who writes chiefly on sixteenth-century theories about metamorphosis, reveals a gradual identifi- cation of werewolves with sorcerers who, helped by Satan, assume an animal guise to achieve their evil end more effectively. There then follows D. A. Trotter's wide-ranging study of two separate but linked aspects of the Godefroy de Bouillon cycle of chansons de geste : he examines, first, the way a pagan story of metamorphosis has been incorporated into a profoundly Christian epic cycle, and then (and primarily) how this story has been adapted to biographical and genealogical ends. The first part of this anthology is completed with A. Paupert's very detailed and sensitive analysis of a page-long 'Conte de la Cigogne' in Les évangiles des quenouilles - a story which tells how storks turn into human beings when they return to Egypt for the winter. The second part ('Métamorphose et métaphore') includes two of the most original and convincing studies. E. Charbonnier 's paper on Le Pèlerinage de Kenart brings out the fact that in any one branch of the Roman de Kenart the anthropomorphism is unevenly distributed: the fox enjoys by far the greatest share of metamorphosis, his allies only a minor share, his enemies (apart from Isengrin) scarcely any. S. Lefèvre, by concentrating on sexual relations and birth myths in the Bestiary tradition, brings to light the special kind of metamorphosis, polymorphism, which permeates these texts ('la double métamorphose chrétienne de la vie et de la mort ...' (p. 239). Three more essays complete the collection: C. Klaus argues that the monsters in Jean de Hanville's Architrenius are seen as proof of Nature's almighty creative powers; S. Robin writes sensitively and intriguingly on the roles of the boar and the snake in the Koman de Mélusine , on its structure and meaning; F. Mora-Lebrun examines the metamorphoses in Antoine de la Sale's Le Paradis de la reine Sibylle</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 85 and concludes that these are the key to this strange and captivating text and together form 'un premier écho des obsessions qui envahiront l'univers de l'homme baroque' (p. 307). An interesting if uneven and disparate set of essays. Glasgow KENNETH VARTY</page></plain_text>
