These combative magical practices are pri marily motivated by retribution for past assaults of a similar kind. While in most cases the shapori perform these activities intentionally, this article argues that the malevolent non-human acts are also driven by the cannibalistic nature of hekura spirits, which demand human souls. In this way, although shapori intentionally engage in bellicose activities, they must sometimes kill in order to appease the ancestral spirits and thus spare the lives of their own kin. This article focuses on the dark side of Yanomami shamanistic practices in order to coun terbalance tendencies that emphasize the more positive, therapeutic aspects of shamanism, namely, its socially integrative roles. Keywords: Amazonia, assault sorcery, body, cosmic order, culture change, ritual, shamanism In South America, and more specifically Amazonia, the dark side of shaman ism has been largely neglected by researchers due to Western prejudices against violence and a discriminatory emphasis on the more positive, healing aspects of shamanism (Whitehead and Wright 2004a). As a result, the pervasive malig nant elements of Amazonian shamanism have been either misrepresented or completely excluded in ethnographic accounts, and the overall picture has been distorted. A few fairly recent studies have attempted to redress this imbal ance by focusing on malevolent magical practices, various forms of assault sor cery and witchcraft, and offensive, destructive aspects of shamanistic practices (Whitehead 2002; Whitehead and Wright 2004a; see also Brown 1988). These works have demonstrated that the dark side of shamanism is not only an omni present part of the ethnographic realities of various Amazonian groups but also Social Analysis, Volume 58, Issue 1, Spring 2014, 107-126 ® Berghahn Journals doi:10.3167/sa.2014.580106 • ISSN 0155-977X (Print) • ISSN 1558-5727 (Online) V s</page><page sequence="2">108 I Zeljko Jokic an indispensable component of their cosmo-shamanistic systems. The central argument in this article is that such an omission and the resulting (mis-) rep resentation of other life-worlds constitute a reproduction of colonial ways of knowing due to "both the denial of radical cultural difference and the refusal to think through its consequences" (Whitehead and Wright 2004b: 1). Farrer (this issue; 2009: 24-25) likewise argues that a blind spot or gap in understanding the shamanic other can result in problems of misplacing the subject. In the case of the Yanomami, however, radical cultural differences were rein forced and highlighted from the beginning. In fact, even before the first perma nent contacts were established with missionaries in 1951, the Yanomami had acquired the reputation, mainly from the neighboring Ye'cuana, of being war like and primitive. For the missionaries (especially the evangelical New Tribes Mission), the Yanomami became the 'poor souls' who needed to be saved, while their shamans became the 'agents of Satan'. The Yanomami's negative image was further reinforced by some scholars—notably, by the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon (1968, 1992), who characterized them as an inherently fierce, violent, and drug-ridden people living in a chronic state of warfare. Even today Yanomami are considered the prime example of ignoble savages, Stone Age remnants who are a window into our own past. Sponsel (1998) argues that the exaggeration of Yanomami aggression and violence has been used against them by the state. Tierney (2000) claims that Chagnon's overt focus on violence helped to justify the invasion of Yanomami territory in search of gold. Albert (1988) similarly maintains that portrayals of Yanomami as violent barbarians can be used to rationalize the violation of their human rights (see also Borofsky 2005). With regard to the issue of destructive magical activities, ever since the pio neering work of Evans-Pritchard ([1937] 1977) among the Azande in Africa, the classificatory distinction has been made in anthropology between witch craft and sorcery, on the one hand, and, by extension, shamanism, on the other. However, this distinction as defined by the Africanist model (ibid.) does not match other ethnographic realities—in this instance, that of Ama zonian cultures (Farrer, this issue). In the literature on Amazonia, witchcraft and sorcery have largely been assimilated under the category of shamanism (Whitehead and Wright 2004). The reason for this is the inherent duality of the shamans' powers, which is reflected in their ability both to heal and to kill— the common shared characteristic of many shamanic complexes throughout Amazonia. In fact, one of the fundamental aspects of Amerindian shamanism is its ambivalence toward shamanistic power (Brown 1988; Crocker 1985; Hugh-Jones 1996). The same practitioner who can cure and protect his or her kin with the help of assistant spirits can also use those spirits for the purpose of inflicting harm and death to others. This article, which is based on my fieldwork among the Yanomami of the Venezuelan Upper Orinoco River Region in 1999-2000, aims to address this dual aspect of shapori (hekura) mou (the Yanomami shamanistic complex)— namely, the dialectic between offensive and defensive shamanism, with par ticular emphasis on its malignant side. My intention here is not to reinforce</page><page sequence="3">Shamanic Battleground | 109 negative views on Yanomami culture, such as those discussed above, but to address this aspect of Yanomami shamanism and lived reality from the point of view of positive and negative reciprocity as a governing principle of Yanomami society (see Lizot 1994). Among the Yanomami, assault shamanism, various forms of sorcery, and other magical manipulations for the purpose of inflicting suffering, illness, and death are always present in everyday life. During my fieldwork in two Yano mami communities, Mahekoto-theri and Sheroana-theri, I observed almost on a daily basis numerous healing sessions performed by the shapori (shamans) in both communities, but also various acts of magical assault directed at dis tant enemies. There is a general agreement in the existing Yanomami literature that the shapori use their hekura spirit-helpers for the dual purpose of cur ing their own people and attacking and killing their enemies. The primary motive for magical assaults is vengeance and retribution for past deaths. Some research papers dealing with this topic provide more or less balanced accounts of shamanism, with frequent emphasis on its positive aspects (see, e.g., de Barandiarân 1965; Wilbert 1963). Two studies that stand out due to their focus on shamanism's malevolent aspects are Lizot's (1985) book Tales of the Yanomami, in which a chapter titled "Eaters of Souls" describes the action of a soul-eating shaman, and Chagnon and Asch's (1973) controversial film Magical Death, which shows a group of Shamathari shamans involved in a collective ritual of paedophagy (i.e., consumption of children). These examples as well as my own case studies reveal part of a wider Yanomami socio-cosmic system based on the governing principle of exchange and reciprocity, in this instance a negative type of reciprocity. Positive reciprocity, which involves mutual obli gations with regard to the exchange of trade goods and the sharing of food, occurs within a single community or between neighboring communities at a short distance from each other. Negative reciprocity involves a cosmic circuitry exchange of magic attacks and shamanic assaults between distant communi ties, and it is primarily motivated by revenge (Alès 2000; Lizot 1994). A Yanomami shapori, akin to his colleagues from other Amazonian ethnic groups, is first and foremost the 'master of spirits'. The relationship between the shapori and his assisting hekura spirits is generally described as one of mutual cooperation, whereby the actions of the hekura abide by the will and intentionality of the shaman (de Barandiarân 1965; Goetz 1969; Wilbert 1963).1 While this is certainly true to some extent, in this article I argue that, due to the malevolent nature of the Yanomami cosmos and its extra corporeal spirit-denizens, the shapori engaged in the act of killing sometimes must do this for the purpose of appeasing those spirits who demand human souls. In order to maintain the cosmic balance, the shaman at times has to take the life of others in order to save the life of his own kin. These harm ful activities form an integral part of the Yanomami shamanistic complex. Their cosmo-geographical patterns and flow of cosmic vital force enhance our understanding of wider social relations and provide insight into the historical transformation of the practice and meaning of shamanism and sorcery within the context of modernity and culture change.</page><page sequence="4">110 I Zeljko Jokic Ethnographic Context The Yanomami are the southernmost and largest of four linguistic Yanoama sub-groups, numbering somewhere between 7,500 and 8,000. The majority of their territory is situated within the Parima-Tapirapecö National Park in the far southeastern corner of Venezuela's southernmost state, Amazonas, a large section of which was declared part of the Upper Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve in 1991. The Yanomami's territory is covered by dense tropical forests and forested mountain ranges, stretching from the Parima Mountains in the east down to the Brazilian border and incorporating the adjacent areas of northern Brazil. On the northern side, it borders that of the Sanema. The south ernmost part of the Yanomami's territory in Venezuela, which was the main area of my field research, incorporates the headwaters of three major regional rivers: the Orinoco, Mavaca, and Siapa. Altogether, I spent just over a year living in two Yanomami communities: Mahekoto-theri and Sheroana-theri. The first community is situated in Platanal, one of the three Salesian missions established in the early 1950s. Lured by the missionaries, the Mahekoto-theri people abandoned their semi-nomadic exis tence and settled on the left bank of the Orinoco River, where they remain up to the present day. Platanal is nowadays a meeting place for many Yanomami, who go there to exchange trade items and visit their relatives. The mission con sists of a church-sponsored bilingual school for children, a rural health clinic with a doctor in charge, and an adjacent hospital building. The second com munity, Sheroana-theri, is linked through kinship ties with some Yanomami of Mahekoto-theri. This small inland community is situated approximately three hours upriver by boat from Platanal where the forest trail begins and then eight hours on foot from the Orinoco River. In the area of my research (see map 1), there is a general pattern that involves the negative exchange of shamanistic assaults, malignant magical activities, and mutual witchcraft accusations among numerous communities situated along, or in proximity to, the Orinoco River. These include the Shero ana-theri, Mahekoto-theri, and distant Shamathari communities located toward the south in the Siapa River basin.2 For the Sheroana-theri, other potential enemies performing magical assaults come from communities clustered around the Mavaca mission. It is important to mention that both present-day Sheroana theri and the community of Pishaansi-theri that originally settled in Mavaca were part of the same 'mother community' by the name of Namowei-theri before they split up due to a dispute around the mid-1940s (Chagnon 1968; Jokic 2003). The ongoing animosity between these groups stems from this historical fission. Magical assaults resulting in illness or death can sometimes be attributed to non-Yanomami shamans and their assisting spirits, usually from the neighboring Ye'cuana people. This region represents a large-scale geographical theater of intercommunal dialectics between offensive and defen sive types of shapori mou practice that generate an endless cycle of tit-for-tat revenge and hekura assaults. It is a macro-universe of the principally repetitive activities engaged in by shapori from different communities.</page><page sequence="5">Shamanic Battleground \ 111 Map 1 The Upper Orinoco River Region , Inchon 8&lt;KiMavadS&amp;JjL »yän^enW# Maheko*&lt;m«» Mavakitafjb !

Cosmos, Hekura, and Initiation Yanomami conceive of the whole universe as consisting of five separate but interconnected celestial and terrestrial layers or 'cosmic discs', each having its own proper name. Together, they form one bounded cosmic totality, which is contained within the abdomen of a giant cosmic boa (hetu mïsi). In the Yano mami language, hetu means boa constrictor, and the suffix mïsi, attached to the name of each separate cosmic disc, signifies 'abdomen' (Lizot 1999). Struc turally, all of these cosmic discs are positioned on top of each other along the vertical cosmic axis. Each separate layer is at the same time a world in itself, with its own horizontal dimensionality limited by the top and bottom surfaces of each layer. Although all cosmic discs exist in their own right, the bottom surface of each disc becomes the top surface of the one below. These distinct cosmic layers represent different structural parts or changing conditions of the cosmic whole as a set of different stages, from new to old Map 1 The Upper Orinoco River Region I .. .# vV Ocamo ♦ Y*nom*mi shabofto t Catholic Mission J J Rapids PstahamMcri I* H«ubuwe*tffi ' Hiomiw-Cffi #Ashidowa''Vi Kedcba bowei-mi (Ushubikivi) ,, MishimishinaSwi.tmi* - , jwi|LiU-«ri ' (the Ax Fight) "1r • k Tflob»t©KH-ttri N»r»mobowei*rer? r N i f t*r</page><page sequence="6">112 I Zeljko Jokic and from male to female. In other words, each cosmic disc represents a state of the cosmos or condition of the cosmic boa's abdomen as a fragmented totality, which is reflected in the names of each respective disc. As Wagner (1991: 167) puts it: "When a whole is subdivided in this way it is split into holographs of itself." The uppermost layer is the young cosmos in its genesis, that is, the 'new abdomen' (oshe m'isi), while the layer farthest down is described as an 'old woman' (hetu mïsi suwë pata). Both celestial and terrestrial realms mirror each other, and together they constitute the primal totality, which I will call the 'cosmic body'—an alternative term for the classical idea of the macrocosmos. It is through the earth level that the male and female cosmic principles converge at the moment of regeneration, transformation, and the death and rebirth of the universe. The earth disc, where the Yanomami (human beings) live, is encap sulated by the celestial vault, the central cosmic component where the whole cosmic order is manifested. The Yanomami cosmos is not a friendly place. It is inhabited by various cannibalistic, anthropomorphic ancestral beings, with each stratum having its own denizens (hekura). The sky is home to a number of celestial beings, including Mothokariwë (Sun), Periporiwë (Moon), Yaru (Thunder), Watawa tariwë (Thunder's son), and Yamirayoma (Lightning), among others. The ter restrial disc, the 'world of the living', is covered with vast tropical rainforests and is home to a number of malevolent beings, chief of whom is Irariwë, the 'ancestral jaguar' (see fig. 1). Finally, the subterranean layer is populated with Figure 1 A Shapori Transformed into the Ancestral Jaguar Irariwë Photograph ® Zeljko Jokic</page><page sequence="7">Shamanic Battleground | 113 Amahiri—Yanomami ancestors who once lived on earth but sank underground due to the collapse of the sky. A constant menace to the Yanomami, the Ama hiri's shamans frequently engage in maleficent acts. Various heknra pose an ongoing threat to the Yanomami, inflicting illness and death by stealing and eating their vital essences. It is only through the process of shamanistic initia tion that these extra-corporeal spirit-beings can become domesticated and put into the service of the shapori. However, the same shamans can—and custom arily do—use these embodied spirits for harmful purposes. Explicit knowledge of representations of the cosmos is generated implicitly in the lived experience of the shamanistic initiation and the 'construction' of the cosmic body or shaman's corporeal microcosm, which is itself a replica of the Yanomami cosmos. While I have discussed this process at length elsewhere (Jokic 2006; see also Lizot 1985: 87-105), here it is important to mention briefly that the initiation essentially entails the metamorphosis of a human being into a heknra being, which is reflected in the Yanomami term for initiation—hekuraprai. The neophyte calls the ancestral spirits to come from the various corners of the universe, inviting them to invade the interiority of his body. This process eventually culminates in the experience of death and rebirth, after which the same heknra spirits become embodied and continue living inside the new shapori. The shaman himself becomes a heknra after receiving various bodily components and attributes of other heknra, such as the crown of light (watoshe) (see fig. 2), which enables him to see at a distance and inside Figure 2 A Candidate Receives the Crown of Light (Watoshe) during a Shamanic Initiation Photograph ® Zeljko Jokic</page><page sequence="8">114 I Zeljko Jokic others' bodies, and toucan wings (hoko), which enable him to fly. Together with these, the new shapori receives the spirit-path {pei yo), spirit-house (sha pono), hekura hammocks (yii), and a cosmic mountain [pei maki). All of these bodily components, together with the embodied hekura, form one complete, self-enclosed system. The shaman's cosmic body is not only a symbolic blue print of the cosmos but also its source and an instrument of its manifestation. Each individual shapori has a distinct set of personal hekura that operate together as a unit. The shaman's body represents their headquarters, with each constituting a separate microcosm, a self-contained whole that co-exists with other shamans and their respective embodied systems of personal hekura. Vari ous shapori operate simultaneously within a transpersonal field of macrocos mic hekura powers. In other words, there is a 'point of touch' in the distance that separates the various shapori. They affect each other directly in a sphere of shared or overlapping modes of consciousness, generated by their embodied hekura helpers and, of course, by the copious hallucinogens used during sha manistic activities. Each individual shapori participates in the sphere of con scious intersubjective relations with other shapori, mediated by their hekura and the psychotropic snuff epena. Apart from being engaged in a kind of intra-shamanic warfare against each other, shapori readily summon their personal hekura spirits for the purpose of affecting other people, whether by inflicting misery and death on them or by helping them to recover from the same effect. Through song and dance they are able to reach a trance state of consciousness, which is in essence their re experience of death. Trance, or the realm of death, at the same time becomes a specific dimensionality of consciousness during which the shapori are able to undergo multiple metamorphoses into any of their embodied hekura spirits. In this state whereby the shapori's self is fused with that of the hekura, the pow ers and abilities of the hekura are used to heal or to inflict misfortune. Ambiguous Shamanic Powers Through the experience of initiatory death and rebirth, the neophyte reaches a specific mode of being as he assumes the new identity of a living spirit 'in the flesh'. This new dual mode of existence—as an immortal hekura occupying the perishable physical body—confers on the shapori a new social status, coupled with a set of duties and responsibilities toward his residential group. Within his own community, the shapori is always engaged in healing protective acts (see fig. 3). Yet the same practitioner can use his powers to send illness and to inflict harm or death on members of other distant communities; in this latter sense, he becomes an enemy. Therefore, a shapori's social status is relative to the situation and to the possibly conflicting points of view of the two or more sets of villages involved. While a shapori can save life, he can also take life. He is responsible for order but can also create disorder. He becomes both protector and defender of the community, shielding his people from the intrusions of the outside hekura</page><page sequence="9">Shamanic Battleground | 115 Figure 3 A Shapori Engaged in Protective, Integrative Activities in His Own Community Photograph ® Zeljko Jokic and enemy shamans. But at the same time he becomes an aggressor, a preda tor, preying upon the young and weak in distant communities (see Cocco 1972: 423). This dual aspect of Yanomami shamanism and the ambiguity of the sha mans' powers is a common characteristic of Amazonian ethnographic realities. However, this is by no means the case everywhere. In some instances, the role of shamans is more delineated. For example, among the Warao, who inhabit the area of the Orinoco River delta, the distinction between dark and light shaman ism is more obvious (Wilbert 1972, 2004). Photograph ® Zeljko Jokic</page><page sequence="10">116 I Zeljko Jokic While an individual shapori can heal or harm, each case of affliction implies both defensive and offensive types of shamanistic activities employed by dif ferent practitioners. For analytical purposes, I distinguish between these two types of shamanistic actions similarly to how Farrer (this issue) defines war magic as both defensive and offensive. But, in reality, each case simultaneously involves elements of either sickness infliction or hekura attack by one or more shapori, on the one hand, and the follow-up treatment or rescue countermea sures employed by another shapori, on the other. This, of course, only applies to cases in which a health disturbance is caused by a deliberate act involving human agency, whether it be an enemy shaman or an öka sorcerer. Such an act always requires the counteractive action of another shaman. Each shapono community is a micro-universe, subject to principally protective and curative activities by resident shapori, but the shapono dwelling is also an arena of shapori's assaults on members of other shaponos (see fig. 4). Structur ally, it is a replica of the Yanomami universe and, at the same time, a manifes tation of the cosmic order—the place where social and cosmic orders converge (Lizot 1976, 1985). The open central area is the celestial arch, which curves down and touches the earth at the point of the horizon, where the higher part of the roof terminates. This communal space in the building is intended for fes tivities and other collective events, such as shamanistic sessions and body cre mation ceremonies. Yanomami tend to perform these activities near the roofs Figure 4 Transformed into a Moon Hekura, the Shapori Searches for a Victim Outside a Shapono Photograph ® Zeljko Jokic</page><page sequence="11">Shamanic Battleground | 117 edge or the lower part of the sky, while the very center of the house is rarely used. The earthen floor of the shapono corresponds to the earth itself—the central disk of the universe. The area of domestic family life, offering shelter and safety, begins at the rim of the roof, while the lower roof's edge demarcates the circumference of the earth's disk. Body, Illness, and Death Yanomami knowledge of the human self-constitution, as revealed through sha manism, is of central importance to any understanding of the processes of illness, cure, and death. There are three main components of the Yanomami multiple soul: pei puhi, pei mt ämo, and noreshi. On the one hand, pei puhi is associated with will power, thought, emotion, and belief (Alès 2000; Chagnon 1992; Lizot 1999). On the other hand, Chiappino (1995) identifies puhi as a vital principle or cosmic force that saturates all of existence, including human bodies. The main difference consists in either viewing pei puhi as a mental capacity or assigning it an existential status. The shapori Ruweweriwë from Sheroana-theri described pei puhi as a 'breath' that resembles horoi (white down used in sha manistic rituals). He stressed the anthropomorphic quality of puhi that is part of a person. Pei mt ämo is another vital principle, with each body part having its own mt ämo. It can be lost or stolen and is susceptible to hekura attacks. After the person's death, the pei mt ämo transforms into no porepi and migrates to the sky. Finally, noreshi is a unique constitutive part of a person with dual manifestation: it is simultaneously a part of the human embodied soul and a specific animal located in the forest. Both parts are inseparable and symbiotic, mirroring each other's actions. Damage to or the loss of one affects the other. Each of these soul components plays a part in the nosology of sickness. For the Yanomami, events surrounding sickness, various types of accidents, snakebites, and eventual death are not merely coincidences or random occur rences or the outcome of bad luck. These disturbances are considered to be the result of an offensive act committed by hekura. In this context, illness is seen as a general disruption of the micro-bodily and, by extension, macro-social equilib rium, and it is believed to be provoked by an intentional act of assault shaman ism. On a micro-bodily level, a sick person may experience a range of symptoms depending on the nature of the malady, thus undergoing changes from being in a state of good health (temi) to being sick (hariri). In other words, sickness implies a total change of the state of the individual—from corporeal equilibrium to disequilibrium. Each case of sickness is unique despite certain commonalities that are manifested as clearly discernible symptoms, such as pain, shortness of breath, fever, or general malaise. At the same time, on the macro level, each case of individual sickness affects the social harmony of the whole group, whose security is suspended until the shapori eventually re-establishes the balance. Illness, in this sense, implies that something is wrong with the whole being and not just a particular part. It is not only a malfunction of a single person but also a disruption of the unified process of living for everyone.</page><page sequence="12">118 I Zeljko Jokic In the Yanomami life-world, bodily and socio-cosmic disequilibrium erupts when something external invades the corporeal interiority and causes fever, pain, or death. In this instance, the shapori's duty is to expel the intruder from the body—and the community—and, in doing so, to re-establish corporeal and social balance. Alternatively, illness or death results when soul-snatching hekura, such as Periporiwë (Moon) or Mothokariwë (Sun), seize and consume someone's pei mi ämo, with or without the shapori's help. The cure consists of the shapori finding the lost mi ämo and inserting it back into the body (Cocco 1972: 403; Lizot 1999: 27). In order for the balance of life and harmony to be re-established, that which is foreign and disruptive must be removed or that which is missing must be brought back and restored to its proper place. The treatment of an individual person by the shapori is thus extended to an entire community as well as the whole cosmos. An abrupt change of well-being can also be brought about through the manipulation of certain magical objects such as arrows or thorns, which are sent by enemy shapori for the purpose of damaging a person's pei puhi. This magical activity produces sharp pain and sometimes death. Ruweweriwë from Sheroana-theri explained to me that the pain produced by the tearing of the pei puhi commonly occurs in specific places in the body: the solar plexus (shiti kari), the area just above the kidneys, the forehead, and sometimes the leg or foot. Through suction and vomiting, the shapori extracts the magic thorn sent by an enemy shapori. He then dispatches the object back to where it came from, customarily a distant Shamathari community or Mavaca or Sejal. Once the magic needle or arrow is expelled from the body, the shapori, with the help of his hekura, proceeds to 'repair' a person's damaged pei puhi. Finally, sickness and death can also be inflicted through 'war sorcery', which is generally understood to involve certain ritual practices for the pur pose of inflicting "misfortune, disease, destruction, or death" on an opponent (Farrer, this issue). The Yanomami generally recognize two lethal types of magical practices: mayo hëri and öka. In order to effect harm, the malefac tor in the first instance carefully collects earth bearing someone's footprint [mayo). This earth is then mixed with some herbs {hëri) and heated over hot flames while chanting is performed. Shapori say that this will cause a person to develop a fever and die. Öka sorcery is a technique of covert war magic that can sometimes trigger a real war. It involves the invocation of specific spells coupled with the use of a powder made from the poisonous aroari plant (cyperus articulatis or cyperus corymbosus) that is found primarily in the Siapa River region. The Shamathari are renowned as experts in this lethal magical practice. The öka sorcerer trav els on foot to a targeted community and blows aroari powder in the direction of a passer-by on the forest path, either from a distance or nearby through a blowpipe or from the palm of his hand. The victim of öka experiences an inner heat that can be extinguished only by the superior fire of the shaman's hekura (Lizot 1985). The Yanomami claim that öka sorcery almost certainly results in an agonizing death after a short period of time and that often not even the shapori can save the victim.</page><page sequence="13">Shamanic Battleground | 119 Case Studies During my fieldwork I witnessed various successful and unsuccessful instances of malignant shamanistic activities, considered from the standpoint of both vic tims and perpetrators. These hostile acts involved soul theft, the use of various magical projectiles, and killing from a distance by strangling. For the purposes of this article, I will focus primarily on the last act by providing two comple mentary examples from the community of Sheroana-theri. In the first instance, the victim was a little boy from the same community who died as a result of a hekura attack executed by the Shamathari shapori from the distant community of Narimipiwei-theri. The second instance was a retaliatory magical assault on a boy from Narimipiwei-theri, carried out by Ruweweriwë, the chief shapori from Sheroana-theri. These two cases are complementary as they represent two dis tinct but interlinked examples of assault shamanism: the first from the victim's standpoint, the second from the perspective of the predator shapori. One day, a young boy from Sheroana-theri suddenly became ill. His con dition progressively deteriorated, and he died two days later. The shapori's diagnosis was that the Shamathari shapori from the community of Narimipi wei-theri had introduced shawara sickness during the boy's sleep and had finished him off days later. I first found out from the boy's mother that he was not well. She said that for the past two days her son had been complaining of pain in his abdomen and blood in his feces. The day before he died, I saw that the amount of blood in his feces had increased significantly. On the day of his death, as his mother held him in her arms, a red, jelly-like substance oozed from his anus. He did not suffer from diarrhea. Lying next to them on the ground were solid, dark-red feces and vomit. Moments before he died, the boy turned very pale. He screamed a few times and started looking around, his eyes full of fear. One of the shapono dwellers mentioned hekura. People started crying. To them he was already lost, for the situation had become extremely grave. As fate would have it, Ruweweriwë was away, taking part in a week-long fishing expedition on the Shanishani River. Moments before passing away, the boy opened his mouth, gasping for air in panic as his little body started twist ing. Suddenly, his frightened look changed, and with eyes full of anger and in a deep adult voice he said: "Ya amishi" (1 am thirsty). A second later, the fear and desperation were present again in his eyes. He called to his mother and father one last time before his chest stopped all movement. A week after the above incident, Ruweweriwë performed an act of revenge by taking the life of a boy purportedly from the same community of Narimipi wei-theri. This example is hence from the perspective of the predator shapori, with the focus not on the victim but on the act of ritual killing itself. For this occasion, Ruweweriwë summoned the Moon hekura Periporiwë. After inhal ing large doses of epena, he crouched and leaned forward, almost touching the ground with his forehead. His body suddenly started shaking and wobbling; it lost all its firmness and natural stability, resembling one big jelly-like mass. He then stood up, crossed his arms on his chest, and started rolling his eyeballs. This was the sign that Periporiwë had arrived, rising up from the ashes and</page><page sequence="14">120 I Zeljko Jokic being born again into this world through the shapori's body. Periporiwë started slowly encircling the shapono, preying on his victim. After making the full circle, the shapori spoke in a child's voice, "Nape, nape ya amishi" (Mother, I am thirsty), while leaning against the house post. He then sat on the ground repeating the same phrase a few more times. The boy was obviously scared and confused, his breathing fast and shallow. He was looking around, touch ing his body in discomfort and calling his mother. The shapori then made a movement as if ripping his skin open with his hands. Then he placed what appeared (to us onlookers) to be an invisible rope around his own neck a few times before strangling himself with one energetic movement upward. His body dropped lifeless to the ground. He then got up, and a female voice started weeping: "Pushika, pushika" (My child). The boy had died, strangled by Peri poriwë as his mother was crying for him. Body Intrusion and the Dynamics of the Cosmic Flow The above examples of combative shamanism demonstrate that magical practices and the accompanying social experience of violence, sickness, and death are first and foremost embodied practices (Farrer, this issue; Kapferer 1991, 2003), with the body being a locus of magical action involving the victim and several shamans. The primary power of Yanomami shapori is their ability to access the interiority of others' bodies with the help of their assisting hekura, whether for the purpose of healing or killing. When the shapori's cosmic body is set in motion during a trance, the interiority of others' bodies 'opens up' and becomes externalized as it fuses with the intentionality of the shapori's consciousness. In other words, during a healing or killing session, and with the help of his personal hekura, the shapori is capable of accessing human bodies: he enters bodies directly, as in the aforementioned cases of hekura attacks, or he detects and extracts from bodies an object of witchcraft or other invading hekura. In this way, the practicing shapori discovers in the victim a 'body fault' or an intrud ing hekura, or he himself becomes the intruder of another body. In the case of predatory shamanism, shapori prefer babies and small children as their potential victims rather than adults. Infants are easy targets as their souls are unstable and not yet fully formed; thus, the chances of a successful outcome are much higher. In the same manner that defensive shamanistic activities involve two com plementary phases of diagnosis and subsequent cure, undertaken with the assisting hekura, assault shamanism generally consists of two steps: surveil lance of the terrain for the purpose of detecting the potential victim and the fol low-up attack. In our second example, the shapori Ruweweriwë first undertook an ecstatic journey to the intended destination in order to locate the chosen victim (see fig. 4). Upon returning to the Sheroana-theri locale, he assumed the identity of the mighty hekura Periporiwë, whose specialty is eating children's delicate souls, and attacked a little boy. When I asked him to describe his journey, he replied that it is like looking at a photograph or a television screen (noreshi) in front of his eyes.</page><page sequence="15">Shamanic Battleground | 121 During the killing act, the somatic space of other people's bodies becomes accessible to the predator shapori in the same way that the interiority of the human body opens up to the shapori involved in the healing act. If the intruder into another's body is a heknra/shapori, when he is detected, the shapori who undertakes a countermeasure assumes the full identity of the intruding shapori by merging his hekura with the intruding one—in effect, becoming that shapori. In this instance, what follows is a direct clash between the two shapori, and their degree of experience and power often determines if the vic tim will live or die. It is misleading to assume that the shapori always sends his hekura to kill, as this implies that they (the hekura) do the job for him, as appears to be the case with Sumatran dukun and their assisting jin (see Neidel, this issue). Instead, when the shapori sends his hekura, he is in fact that hekura. The ritual action thus takes place simultaneously at two different locations.3 In my second example, although Ruweweriwë was physically present in Sheroana theri, he invaded the victim's body while in a trance state as the cannibalistic Periporiwë, and his own body became possessed simultaneously by the victim. Not only was the frightened boy's death materialized in front of us, but also the victim's mother was crying through the shapori after the boy had allegedly died. At the moment of the boy's death, the shapori, who was strangling him self in front of us, also died or experienced the victim's death directly, as his lifeless body collapsed to the ground. What motivates a shaman to commit an offensive act? The primary reasons are vengeance for a previous attack and competition among various shamans. It is evident that assault shamanism involves negative exchange and reciproc ity. The shapori from the Upper Orinoco River region are engaged against their distant enemies in a perpetual cycle of retaliatory revenge and magical assaults that affects not only the competition among them but also the victims of their aggression. Thus, this 'supernatural warfare' involves not only individual fates but broader community relations as well. While offensive acts of assault sha manism are clearly part of hostile human intentionality motivated primarily by vengeance and rivalry, I argue that malignant shamanistic activities are also non-human acts. They are cosmic activities driven by the key attribute of the spirits that shamans embody—their compulsion to eat human flesh. In other words, although the Yanomami shapori intentionally engage in predatory acts for the purpose of inflicting harm and death, when they metamorphose into a jaguar or moon spirit during a trance, they are fully endowed with the charac teristics of these cannibalistic spirit-beings. When the shapori perform offensive acts due to the cannibalistic nature of meat-hungry (naiki) hekura spirits, this is then reflected in shamans' songs. For example, on one occasion during my fieldwork, Ruweweriwë was singing and thus calling the spirit of a vulture, Watupariwë, describing him in the song as dangerous and meat-hungry. During a ritual that same night, Ruweweriwë alleg edly devoured a soul component of a girl from a distant community. On another occasion in Platanal, the chief shapori from Mahekoto-theri, Enano, was telling his spirit-helpers to get up from their bodily hammocks, announcing through</page><page sequence="16">122 I Zeljko Jokic song that the meat-hungry hekura Periporiwë had arrived and was angry, crav ing human flesh and refusing to leave. In order to appease him and to prevent him from snatching a soul of someone from his own community, Enano had to seize a soul from a distant village while in the guise of the same moon hekura. In order to maintain a cosmic balance, the shapori must satisfy the spirits' cravings; otherwise, they become a threat to his own community. In this way, the Yanomami shapori help to balance the predatory forces of the cosmos. In a similar manner, Whitehead (2002: 221) writes that kanaimà ritual killers of the Guyana highlands carry out sacrifices in order to provide "human nourishment" to appease the Lord Jaguar and satisfy his cravings. Behind this interchange of rivalry, power, and disempowerment is the universe, which is driven by the cyclic flow of vital force that swings between the processes of life and death, health and illness, equilibrium and disequilibrium. Concluding Remarks: Shamanism and Culture Change The destructive aspects of Yanomami shamanism are an indispensable part of their shamanistic complex. Various forms of hostile shamanistic activities and hekura attacks employed by the shapori are complementary to the socially inte grative countermeasures used by the same shapori to heal sufferers or to save the lives of affected victims. The 'moral ambiguity' of Yanomami shamans— especially as it concerns hostile acts of magical assaults motivated by ven geance, jealousy, and competition for power and prestige—is the reason why the general categories of shaman and sorcerer overlap. In this sense, shamanism and assault sorcery, at least in the Yanomami case, represent an overlapping and interweaving process rather than strictly separated activities that reflect univer sal categories. The exception to this is the distinction between shamanism and öka sorcery. While the Yanomami shapori can sometimes be a öka sorcerer, the latter is not necessarily a shaman. Öka does not require initiation and can be employed by anyone. The öka sorcerer utilizes substances and spells, works in secret, and directly attacks members of enemy villages. After their killing raids, öka are subjected to a specific purifying rite called unokai. Unlike öka sorcerers, shamans use hekura powers overtly in their malicious magic attacks against dis tant communities, they have little or no direct contact with each other, and they do not need any purification after their malevolent activities (Lizot 1985). What both malicious shamanism and öka sorcery have in common is their tendency to promote the continual need to retaliate, since each suspected death by either technique requires the settling of scores by the same means. After the first permanent contacts with missionaries were established dur ing the 1950s, the spread of previously unknown epidemics and health threats brought misery and multiple deaths to the Yanomami, and this, in turn, resulted in the general increase of sorcery accusations. Ferguson (1992, 1995) goes to the extreme, arguing that Yanomami warfare and, by extension, an increase in harmful magical activities came about due to the presence of and competition for metal tools and other manufactured goods. The population decline was</page><page sequence="17">Shamanic Battleground \ 123 primarily attributed to epidemics of diseases introduced by Westerners, which Yanomami identify as shawara. The magnitude of deaths from various epidem ics led to an overall increase in sorcery accusations and intercommunal warfare, which, in turn, contributed further to population loss. During my fieldwork, Yanomami repeatedly attributed today's relatively small-sized contemporary communities, as compared with the larger communities of the past, to öka sorcery, hekura attacks, and shawara sickness sent by hostile shapori. Conflicts between the various groups have had a particularly devastating effect since fire arms were introduced to the Yanomami (see Ferguson 1992). Destructive aspects of Yanomami shamanism and sorcery still persist in a con temporary post-contact situation of culture change. However, the general crisis has propelled some shapori to call for a cessation of traditional hostilities and for unifi cation against a common outside threat. This is more prevalent in Brazil where the impact of the national society on the Yanomami population has been much more severe than in Venezuela, due to differences in government policies (Albert 1988). In the wake of tragic events that brought multiple deaths and misery to Brazilian Yanomami, Davi Kopenawa, a shaman and an activist from the Toototobi region in Brazil, emerged as a new prophetic leader, warning about the threat of a malicious shawara smoke that will cause the sky to collapse and bring about the end of the world (Kopenawa and Albert 2013). Aspiring to unite all Yanomami against a common peril, Kopenawa sought to create a sense of pan-Yanomami identity. A combination of his shamanistic knowledge of the cosmos and familiarity with the Christian doctrine prompted him to act on behalf of all Yanomami by creating a powerful synthetic cosmo-shamanic discourse composed of Western concepts blended with Yanomami mythology vis-à-vis the impending danger. Continuing to speak out, Kopenawa particularly urges all remaining shapori to stop their bellicose activities and unite the powers of their hekura in order to prevent the sky from collapsing, for the shamans are the only ones who are capable of preventing this cosmic catastrophe. As long as there are living shamans, the sky will remain on high, and the symbolic distance between the two cosmic levels will be maintained. The destruction of the world parallels the decline in shamanism and any further possibility of the manifestation of the cosmos. Without shamans, the symbolic order collapses as the sky crashes to earth and the experience of a differentiated cosmos comes to an end. Con sequently, "[t]he basis for life in this world as it is known ... no longer holds" (Sullivan 1988: 45). Within the overall cosmological matrix, shamans, in this sense, are responsible for preserving life and maintaining the existential balance as much as they are involved in taking life. In the context of post-culture contact, the meaning and content of sorcery, witchcraft, and assault shamanism show historical change. Assault sorcery and hostile shamanistic activities are embedded in a process that reveals how community relations have changed over time. The transformation of society is reflected in the transformation of sorcery. This change is concurrent with the emergence of pan-Yanomami identity and more and more frequent calls to put an end to belligerent activities against each other and to unite against threatening forms of new magic, in which the global peril overshadows local conflicts.</page><page sequence="18">124 I Zeljko Jokic Zeljko Jokic is currently an affiliated Research Associate for the Venezuelan Program for the Elimination of Onchocerciasis - Southern Focus (PNEO-FS) of the Amazon Center for the Investigation and Control of Tropical Diseases (SACAICET). In his capacity as anthropologist-investigator within the PNEO FS, over the past few years he has led numerous scientific-medical teams to various frontier areas of difficult access to locate the unknown Yanomami communities and gather demographic data. He has recently completed a forth coming book, The Living Ancestors: Shamanism, Cosmos and Culture Change among the Yanomami of the Upper Orinoco. His main areas of research interest include indigenous health and medical anthropology and the philosophical foundations of social theory and phenomenology. Notes 1. Hereafter I will use masculine pronouns when referring to Yanomami shamans because they are predominantly male. 2. Shamathari is a collective name for a group of interrelated Yanomami communi ties that have little or no physical contact with the Yanomami from the Orinoco River area. 3. The phenomenon of bilocation is common to shamanism. Rasmussen (1979), for example, writes that during the shamanistic séance, the Inuit shaman and a female Sea Spirit were simultaneously in the house and at the bottom of the sea.
