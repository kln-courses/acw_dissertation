         <title>Introduction: All They Are Saying Is Give War a Chance</title>
         <p>What really fuelled the German protest movement of the late 1960s and its terrorist offshoot? Spirited misreading of Adorno and Marcuse? Outrage over Vietnam? A collective oedipal urge to rid Germany of its brown‐shirted fathers? None of the above, claims “Charly,” a veteran of 1968 and prime countercultural informant in <italic>Das Ende der Alternativen,</italic> Matthias Horx’s whimsical guide through the sorry leftovers of the German protest generation. “At times,” Charly muses, “it seems to me as if all those years our sole aim had been to create an experiential equivalent of what the war had been to our parents; above all it had to be intense, existential, and as tragic as possible.”1 A generation—one of the first in a long time—without its own war felt compelled to stage a supplement in order to live up to its predecessors.</p>
         <p>This may be an odd—and oddly offensive—tidbit of collective pop psychology, but it is not without insight. Indeed, what was the goal of German terrorism? To expose the fascist core underneath the democratic veneer and thus incite an overthrow of the U.S.‐sponsored capitalist system. In other words, starting with the Baader‐Meinhof group’s “war of the six against sixty million,” German terrorism was committed to continuing the war against a fascist Germany that, contrary to common assumptions, had not ended in 1945. Not coincidentally, the very name adopted by the terrorists, <italic>Rote Armee Fraktion</italic> (Red Army Faction) or RAF, recalls both the Russian Red Army and the British Royal Air Force, two military units instrumentally involved in the (incomplete) destruction of the Third Reich. However, judging by the well‐known self‐descriptions popular among the participants—from <italic>Stadtguerrilla</italic> (urban guerilla) to <italic>Befreiungskämpfer</italic> (liberation struggle)—the military scenario that provided Western middle‐class metropolitan unrest with most of its martial props and tropes was not the Second World War but the postwar wave of anti‐imperialist liberation struggles. During the last hundred years, this type of revolutionary exotism practiced by the Western imaginary appears to have shifted from a temporal to a spatial axis; if, as famously analyzed in Marx’s <italic>Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,</italic> the European uprisings of the early nineteenth century donned the clothes of a heroic Greco‐Roman past, those of the late twentieth century preferred the costumes borrowed from Second or Third World conflicts. The goal was to impose what in the eyes of First World insurgents appeared to be clear‐cut—or, in Charly’s words, intense, existential, and sufficiently tragic—distinctions between good and bad, oppressed and oppressor, onto highly industrialized, functionally differentiated societies; and such societies, as frustrated revolutionaries know only too well, tend to stymie revolutionary action in the quagmire of social complexity.</p>
         <p>With the decline of large‐scale political activism in Western Europe and North America these self‐descriptions were redeployed elsewhere, in particular within the more militant discourse of liberation of either nature or new information technologies. Information in particular appears to have become the proletariat of the third industrial revolution. It does the work, but it has yet to gain a true understanding of the historical impact of its labor; it enhances the freedom of those who exploit it, but it is itself unfree; it is by nature international, but it remains subject to national constraints. Technological advances may allow it to reproduce, circulate, and suffuse society at ever higher rates, but it depends on committed activists to secure its liberation. Once the chains imposed by adverse political and technological conditions have been thrown off, however, the new “mode of information” will realize its full potential and yield revolutionary social benefits. Data of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your access restrictions.</p>
         <p>This rhetorical migration from city streets to information highways has been particularly pronounced in North America, where it occurred as part of a large‐scale displacement of utopian hopes of the sixties from social projects onto new information technologies. The fact that the PC, the web, and early forms of VR technology have managed to attract so many of the aspirations born out of the consciousness‐raising campaigns of the sixties has resulted in some family resemblances between the ways in which cyberprophets of today talk about the communal and emancipatory potential of a wired world and their parents’ discourse on social reform. The most conspicuous example of this move from Haight‐Ashbury southward to Silicon Valley may have been Timothy Leary’s well‐publicized career switch from drugs as media to media as drugs; the most flagrant is the way in which multimillion‐dollar software companies flaunt their adherence to the past ideals of Californian counterculture. This “soft” version, as it were, of the genealogical link between flower and browser power was accompanied by a transfer of the more martial tropes of self‐stylization mentioned above. Starting in the late seventies and early eighties, popular culture became attuned to the image of the outlaw hacker, the lonely warrior or techno‐ <italic>guerillero</italic> in the war zone of codes and data who, rather than liberating the working class or the Third World is engaged in a struggle against the regime of IBM, Microsoft, the NSA, or any other force bent on restricting access to, or limiting the movement of, information. (What—one may ask in this context—is Régis Debray’s foray into media other than mediological <italic>foquismo,</italic> a switch from the mobile tactic of Latin American guerrilla warfare to the equally mobile tactics of Marshall McLuhan?)</p>
         <p>This particular type of rhetoric is also present in Germany, although media activists associated with the Bilwet Agentur such as Geert Lovink and Pit Schultz, who propagate a more activist type of net criticism, tend to be located on the margins of the German media/theoretical debates. Instead, some German media theorists tend to treat the relationship between media and war in a thoroughly nonmetaphorical manner and to claim that the struggle to free media from the military‐industrial complex is fundamentally misguided because modern media are in reality military technologies and thus inextricably linked to the military regime. Nowhere is this tendency more clearly expressed than in that particular branch of German media theory which some of its practioners, maybe in a bid for a more commendable scientific aura, like to call <italic>media science</italic> (<italic>Medienwissenschaften</italic>) but that otherwise is known as media discourse analysis, poststructuralist media theory, or, in insider circles, as the hardware faction. The pioneer of this particular approach to media is Friedrich Kittler. Though Kittler remains the most influential theorist, and the only one to have had any significant impact outside of Germany, it would be misleading to label the loosely associated coterie of scholars such as Norbert Bolz, Jochen Hörisch, Georg Christoph Tholen, Bernhard Siegert, Bernhard Dotzler, Wolfgang Hagen, or Rudolf Maresch as Kittlerian and thus assign them to the confines of a clearly demarcated school of thought. Nevertheless, they do share to a greater or lesser degree some basic assumptions that are most clearly evident in Kittler’s work, among them a tendency to fuse aspects of French poststructuralism with an increasingly technologically informed focus on the materialities of communication; a hostility toward subject‐ and/or consensus‐oriented philosophical and sociological approaches (the inevitable target is, of course, Jürgen Habermas); an interest in some of the traditionally less palatable right‐wing thinkers of the Weimar Republic, be it Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, or Ernst Jünger, as well as for the media‐related aspect of Niklas Luhmann’s systems‐theoretical work; and a proclivity—frequently in the footsteps of Paul Virilio—to enthrone “war as the father of all media.”2</p>
         <p>The following remarks will concentrate on this conflation of media and military power as it appears in Kittler’s writings. While I neither agree with this alleged dominance of military technology in media history nor with the central position attributed to the military complex in general history, this essay will provide little in terms of an ideological or moral critique. In my experience, objections of this kind, especially if voiced too early, tend to fizzle out in gratuitous and ineffective rebuttals that merely serve to reinscribe already existing theoretical or ideological allegiances. In order to avoid such exercises in critical noncommunication it is necessary to examine in sufficient detail, first, why and on what grounds the media scientists have put forward these scandalous arguments and, second, whether they are really that far removed from more accepted, seemingly less bellicose theories. The issue, in short, is not whether we should buy this thesis but why theorists are trying to sell it in the first place and whether others are peddling similar, ostensibly less offensive products.</p>
         <p>To be sure, in some cases—and Kittler himself is the prime example—there is a strong rhetorical element involved that obviously is designed to provoke approaches to media that appear to be too anthropocentric or too sociological—that is, from Kittler’s point of view, too sentimental or too naive. Just as in his earlier writings Kittler had reduced writers, thinkers, and poets, the former base units of literary history, to technologically mediated performers of contingent discourse formations, his more recent contributions subjugate human agency in the realm of technological evolution to the escalation of technomilitary exigencies. He clearly relishes the indignation these claims are bound to encounter, especially within a German context, where scholars such as Kittler, Bolz, or Hörisch were exposed to, and actively solicited, considerable hostility both from the Right (traditional hermeneutics) and the Left (Frankfurt school) before they themselves attained positions in which they, in turn, became the focal point of youthful unrest.3 Nevertheless, the goal of this paper is to show that there is more to the conflation of war and media than post‐ or antihumanist braggadocio or intra‐academic posturing. An internal analysis tracing the ascendancy of the military component will show that for a theorist such as Kittler war is a structural feature with considerable explanatory power that grows out of the merging of Foucauldian positions with new, allegedly posthermeneutic approaches stressing the materialities of communication—an explanatory power, however, that depends on a terminological vagueness that obscures the boundaries between literal and metaphorical meanings of terms such as <italic>war, mobilization,</italic> or <italic>combat</italic>. A concluding section will briefly highlight some promising parallels between Kittler and North American theorists, though I consciously have not chosen those associated with high cultural or literary theory. Rather, the technological implications of Kittler’s writing invite comparison with related educational (Keith Hoskin) and economic‐informational analyses (James Beniger).</p>

         <title>From Medial to Martial a priori</title>
         <p>“War!? What is it good for?” a famous rock anthem from the 1960s asked, only to give the answer, “Absolutely nothing!” A laudable statement, but—especially out of the mouths of rock musicians—somewhat uninformed if not hypocritical. As uncensored histories of recording technology show, war was good enough to provide rock’n’roll singers with the very technology they employ to inform their audience that war is good for nothing. Indeed, so numerous are the ties linking military hardware to recording studio equipment that it is difficult to decide which one to pick first. One important date is 11 September 1944, when U.S. forces liberating Luxembourg and its famous radio station came across an extraordinary magnetophone that, to the amazement of Allied radio monitors, had allowed for a lifelike and scratch‐free fidelity of sound that ordinary transcription records could never have yielded.4 While the commercial production of magnetic recording systems at Bell Labs was actively suppressed by upper management despite the fact that already during the 1930s Clarence Hickmann had developed them to the point of practical application, the German development was fuelled by the need for superior combat recording technologies and for improved means to analyze and manipulate secret Morse messages. Subsequently, information gathered from captured German code‐breaking equipment “enabled EMI to manufacture tape and tape recorders, resulting in the production of the famous BTR series which remained in use at Abbey Road for over 25 years.”5 The strange dispatches allegedly encoded by Abbey Road’s most famous clients—including the tidings that “Paul is dead”—presupposed machines German counterintelligence had used for decoding enemy transmissions.</p>
         <p>Not that rock ’n’ roll kept its origins a secret. When the Beatles told the story of the man in their birth town “who sailed to sea / in the land of submarines,” they were also telling the story of the birth of full‐frequency range recording out of the technology of early submarine sound detection and identification practices. In 1940, faced with the prospect of losing the Battle of the Atlantic to German wolf packs, <disp-quote>
               <p>the RAF Coastal Command had approached the English‐owned Decca Record Company with a secret and difficult assignment. Coastal Command wanted a training record to illustrate the differences between the sounds of German and British submarines. Such aural distinctions were extremely delicate, and to reproduce them accurately on a record called for a decided enlargement of the phonograph’s capabilities. Intensive work … led to new recording techniques.6</p>
            </disp-quote> In Kittler’s words, “We All Live in a Yellow Submarine” sings of—and acoustically performs—“the literal chain that linked Liverpool’s submarine crews to postwar rock groups.”7 Rather than of sex and drugs, “rock songs sing of the very media power which sustains them,” and that media power is said to be fundamentally military in nature (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 111). Moreover, given the diffusion of Western societies with the media in question, one could argue, as does Hörisch, that the Beatles’s “Yellow Submarine” not only provides a performative techno‐genealogy of full frequency range recording but also amounts to a plausible societal self‐description. The Y2K craze was merely the latest expression of the fear that without the most advanced technologies the media‐dependent nations would simply collapse because what was once characterized as physiologically reliable sensory perception no longer suffices for individual or collective orientation.8 Our increased reliance on technologically mediated representations of the outside world reflects the fact that we are as unable to directly interact with the electromagnetic environment we have come to depend on as a submarine crew can access the water on the other side of the hull. We all live in a yellow submarine, and no large submarine was ever built for peaceful purposes.</p>
         <p>This is the gist of the stories told in Kittler’s <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> and the technology‐oriented essays collected in the volume <italic>Draculas Vermächtnis</italic>. 9 Originally conceived as a technical addendum to <italic>Discourse Networks, Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> is, despite its international cast ranging from Alexander Graham Bell and Alan Turing to Roger Waters and Mick Jagger, a very German book—to be precise, a book of the German 1980s. Though there is hardly any reference to the deployment of Soviet SS‐20s, the NATO “double‐track decision” to respond with the deployment of more cruise missiles, the militant rhetoric of the Reagan administration, or even the German peace movement (which peaked at the time of book’s writing), <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> contains, albeit in a cool and detached fashion, some of the fundamental concerns and positions that shaped the West German political (counter)discourse of the day, in particular the notion that the next war is around the corner, that the bomb is about to fall, and that all this appears inevitable given that politics has been subordinated to technomilitary logistics. From this—admittedly limited—point of view, Kittler’s book, published at the very moment that Gorbachev’s reforms spelled the beginning of the end of the Soviet military empire, is one of the very last products of the cold war.</p>
         <p>The text, however, operates on a larger scale because the forty‐year U.S.‐Soviet arms race appears as just another inescapable phase in an ongoing media‐technological buildup fuelled by military conflict. According to this reading, <disp-quote>
               <p>Phase 1, beginning with the American Civil War, developed storage technologies for acoustics, optics, and script: film, gramophone, and the man‐machine system, typewriter. Phase 2, beginning with the First World War, developed for each storage content appropriate electric transmission technologies: radio, television, and their more secret counterparts. Phase 3, since the Second World War, has transferred the schematic of a typewriter of predictability per se; Turing’s mathematical definition of computability in 1936 gave future computers their name. [<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 243]</p>
            </disp-quote> Subsequently, the installation of electromagnetic, pulse‐resistant, optical fibers—with which <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> begins and ends—is just a new stage in an ongoing struggle for supremacy among media technologies. The escalation from the trench fighting of World War I over the blitzkrieg of World War II to the global preparations in and over Vietnam, Iraq, and Bosnia for a digitally masterminded “Star Wars” or World War III, then, corresponds exactly to the technological progress from storage media to communication media and, ultimately, to an all‐inclusive digital computation that encompasses the preceding stages. The war to end all wars leads to the medium to end all media.</p>
         <p>This does not mean that media are exclusively invented in wartime or by the military, but it does imply that the crucial instances in their development are responses to the exigencies of strategic command. The decisive moment in the evolution of a media technology is its military application; indeed, so decisive is this moment that all other applications, no matter how widespread, innovative, or sophisticated, are said to be mere distortions, possibly even cover‐ups, of the determining military qualities. Whether it is a matter of Karlheinz Stockhausen mixing his first electronic compositions on discarded U.S. Army equipment, modern hi‐fi technology living off innovations in aircraft and submarine location technologies, or radio stations exploiting the VHF frequency modulation and signal multiplexing that had been indispensable for the successful coordination of General Guderian’s tank blitzkrieg, “the entertainment industry”—to quote one of Kittler’s most (in)famous aperçus—“is, in any conceivable sense of the word, nothing but an abuse of army equipment” (<italic>GFT</italic>, pp. 96–97). All nonmilitary applications of modern media‐technologies are secondary to, and frequently dependent upon, their determining military aspect. As Bolz categorically states, “the history of mass media is the <italic>historia in nuce</italic> of modern war.”10</p>
         <p>Objections are, of course, inevitable. How much historical truth is there to the claim that “the technologies of typewriting and sound recording are by‐products of the American Civil War” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 190)? And even if the First World War was a pivotal event in their subsequent evolution, what of their long, nonmilitary early history within the realms of psychophysical research and the early entertainment industry that Kittler himself describes in great detail in <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter?</italic> Can all that simply be termed “abuse”? Are not the origin and decisive early growth of modern media technologies such as the telephone unrelated to war or military expertise? Does not the cultural history of the telephone—a medium, incidentally, that the army initially had difficulties with—prove that social contingencies outweigh military application? In fact, does not war at times hinder the development of new media—as appeared to be the case with Konrad Zuse’s computer in the Third Reich?11</p>
         <p>It may be impossible to explain war‐related media innovations—for instance, the French mechanical telegraph of 1794—in nonmilitary terms. One of Kittler’s seemingly less controversial points—the claim that from Bletchley Park’s COLOSSUS and its more powerful American clones to the strategic considerations guiding the construction of ARPANET, the <italic>Ur</italic>‐internet, and the advances in VR technologies, the development of digital is driven by military advances—may require a second glance. As Timothy Lenoir has pointed out regarding the development of virtual reality technology, federal funding from military agencies and related sources was indispensable for triggering and sustaining VR technology research for at least two decades before an entertainment‐driven commercial industry was prepared to take the lead.12 Lenoir’s detailed analysis of budgets, research programs, and the extensive interpenetration of government, academia, and industry shows how federal projects were able to make up for failed early industry initiatives (for example, Atari), partly because they had the right mix of basic research and long‐term vision, out of which grew an array of hardware and software that increasingly found its way into the entertainment industry. Along with the budget cuts of the 1990s, however, the new procurement guidelines for the Department of Defense were geared toward a more cost‐effective interface between military requirements and commercial manufacturing processes. The army, as it were, is now more into shopping than handing out exclusive contracts. To be sure, this does not mean that the military is out of the picture, but on the whole it appears that military technology, which once took the lead, now tends to lag behind what is available in games, rides, and movie special effects. Thus a recent comment by a U.S. Secretary of the Army, “We could never hope to get the expertise of a Steven Spielberg or some of the other film industry people working just on Army projects,” appears to invert Kittler’s abuse axiom.13 If the Marine Corps uses the game DOOM for training four‐person fire teams, or if Air National Guard adapts FALCON 4.0 to military training, army equipment has become an abuse of entertainment technology.</p>
         <p>The problem, however, is that if objections of this kind are applied against theorists such as Kittler (which Lenoir is not doing), they are in danger of missing a strategically deployed terminological vagueness that allows media scientists to sidestep such criticisms. This vagueness, which ultimately derives from the Foucauldian background of media discourse analysis (more on this later), has to do with the very meaning of <italic>war</italic>. When media scientists use this term, it is often not clear whether they are talking about a military scenario—ranging from mobilization to actual combat—or whether they are trying to find an expression that adequately conveys the sensory overload and its long‐term psycho‐ and sociogenetic impact we now experience on a daily basis. Reading Kittler, it appears that these days we are all exposed to what Jünger could only witness in the heat of the battles of World War I. Seated in front of terminals, movie screens, or loudspeakers, equipped with microphones, headphones, or VR headgear, we all experience—to quote the Jünger title Kittler is fond of quoting—“combat as inner experience” (<italic>Kampf als inneres Erlebnis</italic>). At this point, the theory busily shuttles to and fro between the literal, the more extended, and the clearly metaphorical meanings of war or combat; it therefore is necessary to understand how exactly the theorists in question deal with the overlapping of war and mediated sensory overload.</p>
         <p>Extending Kittler’s as well as Paul Virilio’s analyses, Wolfgang Hagen has claimed that all new media have a “negative horizon of war.” That is to say, the military horizon surrounding and shaping these technologies is invisible <disp-quote>
               <p>because in the perception of the “public sphere,” into which the media are “released” as if into a harmless entertainment sphere, it [the negative horizon of war] instantaneously disappears. Such was the case with radio in the 1920s, with VHF and television in the 1950s, and with the computer in the 1980s. It is also negative because the media’s military genesis and cause “negate” the very concept of war. On the basis of new, transnational informational strategies war has mutated from a state of emergency to a normal state of affairs intrinsic to the modern industrial nations.14</p>
            </disp-quote> The first part of this diagnosis rephrases Kittler’s assertion that the sounds, images, voices, and texts emanating from screens and headphones are just distracting eyewash or media‐produced glamour that blinds consumers to the military character of the technology they are using. The scenario that emerges—and which some would no doubt label paranoid—is one of the military only consenting to the civilian use of a media technology if it is too outdated to serve military purposes or if it is certain that its release into the civilian world will have no negative impact on military operations. One of the most frequently used examples in German scholarship is the origin of German radio. Beginning in May 1917, primitive tube transmitters were used to transmit early radio programs along the trenches, but the upper echelons quickly put a stop to such abuse of military hardware. With the demobilization of almost 200,000 radio operators still in possession of their equipment and the revolutionary unrest following the lost war, however, the incipient republic was in danger of losing control of its recently acquired airwaves. <disp-quote>
               <p>For the simple purpose of avoiding the anarchistic abuse of military radio equipment, Germany received its entertainment network. Records that hitherto had been used to liven up military communication in the trenches of the Ardennes now came into their own. Otherwise people themselves, rather than the government and the media industry, could have made politics. [<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 97]</p>
            </disp-quote> Because the primary goal of modern warfare is not to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible but to destroy the enemies’ communication installations and gain control of the electromagnetic spectrum, the army only tolerated civilian intrusion into the ether if it was restricted to particular frequencies. The release of military technology is viable only if “pleasure is produced as a by‐product” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 1) that serves to obscure the military agenda. “For a while, when he has nothing better to do with his equipment, Sergeant Pepper, the former submarine commander from Liverpool, entertains the lonely hearts.”15</p>
         <p>There is a tendency among German (and other) critics to oppose poststructuralist media science to the more sociological or sociocritical media analyses in the tradition of Walter Benjamin, the Frankfurt school, the notion of the proletarian public sphere as developed by Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, or Jürgen Habermas’s media‐related work in his theory of communicative reason. No doubt, some of the media scientists cater to this division by ridiculing Habermas, casting doubt on the hallowed writings of Benjamin, or exposing the “stupidities of Adorno’s theory of mass media,” but one is left to wonder whether these distancing maneuvers are so vociferous because they, purposefully or not, are hiding structural affinities.16 To a certain extent, the above analysis resembles the top‐down manipulation theory commonly associated with the early Frankfurt school and its progeny; a sinister military‐industrial complex is in charge of how media are used, and while the masses (as well as students of cultural studies) may delude themselves into believing that unlimited access to airwaves, the ubiquitous availability of increasingly sophisticated gadgets, or the ability of consumers to decode incoming messages any way they want will amount to a veritable liberation of the media, the true nature of the technology is obscured by superficial entertainment. For some poststructuralist media theorists, entertainment is as much an opium for the people as it was for their colleagues located farther to the Left, though now it is handed out by the general staff rather than by the ruling class. In any case, the moral of the story is that media technologies are like circus elephants; they may be tamed and trained for entertainment purposes, but they can never be domesticated.</p>
         <p>However, there is more at stake than eyewash, pleasure, and distraction. These terms presuppose a principal qualitative difference between a media technology’s military usage and its secondary employment in the civilian sphere, but if war is now the normal state of affairs for the industrialized nations, then potentially all media technologies, no matter who designed them for what purpose, add to the suffusion of society with war. In this case, the term <italic>war</italic> transcends its restricted meaning and now refers to a set of basic operational procedures that are as indispensable to combat situations and military engagements as they are to the routines of everyday life of modern society. The execution of these operations involves surveillance, information gathering, and interception while their preparation involves drill, mobilization, and the creation of self‐guided operators. The latter is also known as subject‐formation: <disp-quote>
               <p>War, as opposed to sheer fighting, has been for a long time an affair of persuasion. It came into being only when people succeeded in making others die for them. Before their probably fatal orders were obeyed, commanders had first to create subjects, both in the philosophical and political sense.… This is why traditional warfare could simply not do without the presence of chiefs or seconds‐in‐command. In some famous battles, Frederick the Great needed almost as many troops to motivate and to control his own soldiers as were left to attack the Austrian enemy.17</p>
            </disp-quote> From Napoleon dispatching twenty letters per hour to his divisions to Guderian’s VHF‐enabled coordination of tank formations, infantry troops, and air force units, the obvious reason for the widespread development of communications technologies was to compensate for the physical absence of central command from increasingly large and mobile battlefields that no longer allowed for direct visual communication. This, however, is only part of the story, and not even the most important one at that. What is at stake is the creation of a repository of human subjects both willing and capable of responding to incoming messages that require them to put their life at stake. The training of professional soldiers (or of volunteers and draftees in wartime) is no more than the military icing on a cake of an already mobilized humanity; to be trained in combat technologies presupposes an ongoing collective drill in “so‐called peace” that suffuses all parts of society (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. xxxix). Thus, not only is the history of media and information technology the history of war in a nutshell; the sensory drill imposed upon us by weapons systems posing as entertainment gadgets is an ongoing collective neurophysiological boot camp designed to bring us up to the reaction speeds of the next electronic war. “VHF tank radio, vocoders, Magnetophones, submarine location technologies, air war radio beams, etc., have released an abuse of army equipment that adapts ears and reaction speeds to World War <italic>n+1</italic>. Radio, the first abuse, lead from World War I to World War II, rock music, the next abuse, from II to III” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 111). Giving a martial twist to Benjamin’s famous remark that every historical era “shows critical epochs in which a certain art form aspires to effects which could be fully obtained only with a changed technical standard,” it appears that technology looks ahead whereas people look backward.18 While generals always fight the last war and peacekeepers always keep the last peace, media are anticipating the next war. “Our discos are preparing our youth for a retaliatory strike” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 140). Modern media drill, reshape, and mobilize the human body, its sensory apparatus, and its nervous system to make it more compatible with the requirements of modern electronic warfare. In short, we are dealing with drill and distraction, but the distractions are always already part of the drill. Thus, <italic>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</italic> and related essays provide an extended commentary on an insight attributed to Ronald Reagan: that joystick‐equipped video games are excellent practice for the reflexes and reaction speeds of future fighter pilots (see <italic>GFT</italic>, p. 140).</p>

Taking an additional cue from Walter Benjamin (in particular, from the section “To the Planetarium” at the conclusion of <italic>One‐Way Street</italic>), Bolz argues that from the point of view of media technology war is nothing but accelerated technological change “that punishes humans for not adequately exploiting the massive technological means, that is: for failing to use them as extensions of themselves” (p. 99). Benjamin had described technology as a <italic>physis</italic> “through which mankind’s contact with the cosmos takes a new and different form,” a contact characterized by major shake‐ups and disorientation. “In the nights of the annihilation of the last war, the frame of mankind was shaken by a feeling that resembled the bliss of the epileptic. And the revolts that followed were the first attempt of mankind to bring the new body under its control” (Walter Benjamin, “One‐Way Street,” trans.

               <p>Though Kittler correctly points out that Zuse was unsuccessful in offering to Army Communications his “binary calculator” as an encryption machine, he later claims—in line with his narrative of the World War II–driven evolution of early computers—that at the end of the war it was used to determine “in the bunkers of the Harz the fate of the V2” (<italic>GFT,</italic> p. 259). In his memoirs Zuse tells a very different (and very Pynchonesque) story. The fourth machine assembled in his parents’ apartment, the Z4, was also known as the “V4” (<italic>Versuchsmodell</italic> or “experimental model” [p. 91]). Because this sounded and looked a lot like V1 and V2, one of his collaborators managed to persuade the authorities to order Zuse and his fellow workers to move the Z4/V4 out of besieged Berlin to one of the underground ordnance factories near Göttingen, where thousands of concentration camp inmates were assembling the V2 rockets. The group took one look at the inhuman conditions, secured an army truck, and escaped to the South German Allgäu region to sit out the end of the war; see Zuse, <italic>The Computer</italic>— <italic>My Life,</italic> trans. Patricia McKenna and J. Andrew Ross, ed. Hans Wössner (Berlin, 1993), pp. 91–94. The source of Kittler’s mistake appears to be Andrew Hodges’s biography of Alan Turing—a text of almost canonic status in the Kittlerian media school. Hodges claims that “Zuse calculators were used in the engineering of V2 rockets, and in 1945 Zuse himself was installed in the Dora underground factory” (Andrew Hodges, <italic>Alan Turing: The Enigma</italic> [New York, 1983], p. 299). In a detailed analysis, Thomas Goldstrasz and Henrik Pantle use the example of Zuse to make the point against Kittler that even in the case of early digital technology some media were developed not because but in spite of the war. The authors also contacted Hodges regarding the contradiction between his and Zuse’s own account, to which Hodges replied: “There is no contradiction—simply my mistake … It is the worst mistake that has come to light… . It surprises me that no‐one has noticed this error before; not even in the seven years in which it [the Turing biography] has been available in German translation” (Thomas Goldstrasz and Henrik Pantle, “Informatik und Heeresgerät: Die Entwicklung des Computers während des Zweiten Weltkriegs,” at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

         <p>As already mentioned, this argument depends on a terminological vagueness. The objectionable factor of media science is not that so many different things are reduced to war but the fact that war can mean so many different things. With regard to the way in which it is deployed in debates, the distinction between drill and distraction corresponds to the ambiguous usage of the term <italic>war,</italic> the meaning of which oscillates between actual combat in wartime and ongoing mobilization in so‐called peace. When the debate is located on a more superficial level, the latter terms (distraction and mobilization) appear to be distinct from the former (drill and combat), whereas on a more basic level the latter are subsumed by the former. While the more restricted meaning of war and drill allows for a (frequently polemic) focus on “authentic”—and darkly glamorous—military qualities without having to resort to more psychological, social, or economic arguments involving sensory overload, data glut, control crises, information blockage, logistics, collective acceleration, and so on, the ability to extend the meaning of war beyond actual combat allows media scientists to parry empirical objections that have been amassed in order to disprove the military origin of media technologies even when the technology appears to be altogether nonmilitary.</p>
         <p>However, it is one thing to criticize this nimble vagueness within the theoretical framework; it is something different to assess to what degree it represents a rather accurate description of modern society. Take one of the most frequently used historical examples, the installation of Claude Chappe’s first (visual‐mechanical) telegraph system in France in 1794. Given that the telegraphic separation of communication from transportation represents the first major incursion of postliterary technologies into the Gutenberg galaxy as well as the first erosion “of the alphabet as the foundational code system of Europe,” it comes as no surprise that Chappe’s invention is frequently alluded to by media scientists.19 Its military origin and qualities are obvious: it facilitated direct contact between the high command in Paris and the troops of the Republic; Napoleon later used it to great advantage; and other nations adopted telegraphy with military objectives in mind (in Germany, the installation of the electric telegraph is directly connected to the revolutions of 1848). In fact, the very first messages, communicated on 15 Aug. and 1 Sept. 1794 from Lille to Paris, were military dispatches announcing the liberation of, respectively, Le Quesnoy and Condé‐sur‐l’Escaut from the Austrians; and one account has it that the very last message transmitted along Chappe’s lines reported the capture of Sebastopol in September 1855.20</p>
         <p>But examining the sources reveals that the main arguments behind the favorable reception of Chappe’s project by the revolutionary government went far beyond its military use.21 When the newspaper <italic>Le Moniteur universel</italic> published Chappe’s dispatch concerning the capture of Condé, it was erroneously signed with “Chappe, engineer‐geographer” (rather than “engineer‐telegrapher”), but this slip of the pen “well illustrated the fact that Chappe’s system was part of a reorganization of the national domain.”22 Perceived to be a technological expression of utopian conceptions of rationalizing time, space, and communication, the telegraph was seen to promote the revolutionary projects of spatiotemporal homogenization and linguistic unification. It contributed to a dynamics of territorial coherence by allowing for instantaneous dissemination of information using a code system far removed from the vagaries of the spoken language. In short, Chappe’s telegraph supported the revolutionary drive toward <italic>liberté, égalité, simultanité,</italic> where all are the same, all has to take place in (and at) the same time. If theorists from Marshall McLuhan to Benedict Anderson have stressed the importance of print technology in the creation of temporally homogenous imagined national communities for which individuals will willingly lay down their lives, the German media hardware faction center on the pivotal importance of telegraphy and subsequent Edisonian innovations for turning nations into mobilized societies that can relay men and material to modern battlefields as quickly and economically as possible. In his canonized essay on “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin argued that the development of the new photo‐ and cinematographic media was fuelled by the desire of the masses “to bring things ‘closer’ spatially and humanly.”23 To which Bernhard Siegert bluntly responded, with the telegraphic a priori in mind: “To bring the masses closer together ‘spatially and humanly’ was the objective of the Prussian General Staff since the war of 1866 and of all the nations involved in the First World War.”24 Ultimately, just as media distraction turns out to be a form of drill, mobilization by media is subsumed by combat.</p>
         <p>Leaving aside this problematic conceptual flexibility, the above discussion will allow me to tackle the original question, Why war? What is it good for—at least within media science? The claim that entertainment media are an “abuse of army equipment” obviously only makes sense if there is an original or genuine dimension to media technology. As the Austrian media theorist Frank Hartmann has argued, the emphasis on the military nature of media systems allows Kittler’s “media archeology” to once again posit a type of authenticity (<italic>Eigentlichkeit)</italic>. 25 Given the indebtedness of most poststructuralist media theorists to Heidegger—a theoretical heritage that has yet to be fully analyzed—this term appears particularly apposite; but one might just as well apply the Marxist categories of use‐value and exchange‐value. Commercial forces distort a technology to such a degree that its true nature (military use‐value) is hidden underneath its alienated exchange‐value (as part of the entertainment industry). By the same token, however, the “drill” technologies in question contribute to a dynamic that will eventually lead to a cataclysm in the wake of which their use‐value will be liberated, that is, military technologies will unfold their full potential and come into their own. But whether one chooses to discuss the conflation of war and media in terms of Heidegger or Marx, the fact remains that this conflation allows for the reactivation of certain metanarratives that had been declared obsolete by postmodernism. Once again, we are dealing with categorical distinctions between essence and attribute as well as with a clearly delineated grand history that tells the story of the gradual enframing and replacing of humans by media technologies and the subsequent sublation of those individual technologies into the <italic>über</italic>medium of the computer. To be sure, the evolutionary dynamic can no longer be linked to philosophical tales of subjectivity, consciousness, communicative reason, or the itinerary of the world spirit, but the new grounding of old teleological ordering principles in the autonomous escalating mechanism of military necessities should restrain us from labeling in shorthand fashion the work of Kittler and like‐minded scholars as poststructuralist theorizing.</p>
         <p>What is more important, however, is to realize how the central position of war grows out of, and then attempts to solve, problems inherent in the genealogy of so‐called poststructuralist media theory. As observers have noted and practitioners have confessed, this particular type of media discourse analysis, in which media appear as the historical a priori of the organization of our sensory perception, derives to a considerable extent from Foucauldian discourse analysis.26 By focusing on the materialities of communication that are said to shape and preprocess all discursive practices, the archeological Foucault of the sixties is both extended and grounded. He is extended insofar as discourse analysis, which had been limited to the domain of scriptography and typography, is now also applied to the domains of electric and electronic writing; and he is grounded insofar as the discursive formations revealed by Foucault are themselves revealed to be the effects of media dispositives. In other words, the a priori position of Foucault’s somewhat abstract episteme is now occupied by more concrete medial structures in the shape of a “discourse network,” that is, a “network of technologies and institutions that allow a given culture to select, store, and process relevant data.”27</p>
         <p>However, this attempt to play Marx to Foucault’s Hegel—that is, to pull discourse analysis off its textual head and place it on its media‐technological feet—comes at a price. Along with all the formidable equipment to be found in Foucault’s toolbox, media discourse analysts are bound to inherit some of its more questionable contents, of which the issue of discontinuity and evolution is the most problematic. As mystified readers know, Foucault’s <italic>The Order of Things</italic> engages in a meticulous analysis of three different epistemes, yet no clues are given as to why these epistemes change, why they change so quickly, or why the changes take place when they do rather than a half‐century earlier or later. In his excellent foreword to Kittler’s <italic>Discourse Networks</italic> David Wellbery has pointed out that the discussion of the three discourse networks (“Scholars’ Republic,” “1800,” and “1900”) bears more than a passing resemblance to Foucault’s analysis of the “Renaissance,” “Classical,” and “Modern” epistemes in <italic>The Order of Things</italic>. 28 In both cases the focus on the epistemic (Foucault) or the medial a priori (Kittler) shifts the attention away from individuals and social forces in order to challenge traditional notions of cultural and intellectual continuity. However, the German medial turn, rather than being a mere functional equivalent, is also designed to explain the baffling change of Foucauldian epistemes by relating them either to the dissemination of new technologies or to changes in the ways existing technologies are implemented. Thus, the switch from Kittler’s “Scholars’ Republic” to the “Discourse Network 1800”—which roughly corresponds to the shift from Foucault’s “Classical” to the “Modern” episteme—is related to the fact that around 1800 the institutionalization and construction of writing changed dramatically. In turn, the switch from “1800” to “1900”—analogous to Foucault’s return of language around 1900 in the shape of psychoanalysis, ethnology, and linguistics—is linked to the overturning of the monopoly of writing by the Edisonian trinity of gramophone, film, and typewriter. The correspondences could be extended; after all, who can ponder the famous wager at the conclusion of <italic>The Order of Things</italic> that—in consequence of some outside “event” Foucault refuses to specify—“man would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea,” without wondering whether it is not the compression of that very sand into silicon that erases the face and gives rise to a posthuman(ist) techno‐episteme?29</p>
         <p>Technological changes occurring on the levels of material deployment prior to questions of meaning will affect the changing configurations of meaning. “Discontinuity”—Foucault wrote—“probably begins with an erosion from outside, from that space, which is, for thought, on the other side, but in which it has never ceased to think from the very beginning.”30 That space on the outside of thought and yet so subservient and innocuous that it also appears to belong to the realm of thought is now said to belong to the space of media. To quote the most militantly laconic one‐liner of German media science: “Media determine our situation” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. xxxix). But this is not much of an explanation; it merely serves to defer the question from one a priori to the next. So media shifts are said to cause epistemic shifts—but what causes the former? Why these more or less sudden ruptures in media ecologies? What fuels media evolution? This is a loaded question for any media theorist but especially for those of a so‐called poststructuralist disposition who have a priori ruled out certain answers. Whatever the evolutionary mechanism, the emphasis on discontinuity precludes that it work in a smooth, continuous fashion; more important, the assumptions guiding the theoretical framework will block any overly anthropocentric reference to the development of human needs and desires. “Technical media don’t arise out of human needs, as their current interpretation in terms of bodily prostheses has it,” Kittler pronounces with a jab at (the revival of) McLuhan, “they follow each other in a rhythm of escalating answers.”31 Media evolution is delinked from the desires or needs of a generic subject that is said to have first externalized its motor interface, then its sensory apparatus, and finally its intelligence; rather, it follows an internal logic according to which different media technologies provoke each other in a fight for supremacy. The very terminology employed by Kittler—“the history of communication technologies [is] a series of strategic escalations”—already contains the answer: war.32 Media evolve because war is both the context and the catalyst that will allow for the launching, perfection, and clashes of storage, communication, and computation technologies. It is, of course, a fairly Pynchonesque conception of war; indeed, the canonic position Thomas Pynchon occupies in the writings of many media scientists is in part due to the depiction of war in <italic>Gravity’s Rainbow,</italic> not as clash between nations, peoples, or ideologies, but as part of an ongoing lethal game of one‐upmanship among different technologies, logistics, and allocation priorities.33</p>
         <p>But, once again, is this really an explanation? The discursive a priori is referred back to a medial a priori that, in turn, is referred back to a martial a priori. Yet why stop here? So war drives the evolution of media, but what drives war?34 To attribute war in the final analysis to political, cultural, social, or economic factors would only serve to reinscribe on a fundamental level the very domains that have been done away with by the theory’s medial a priori. But what other explanations can there be? The question is difficult to answer; neither Kittler nor any related media theorist has really dealt with it. As a consequence, the next two paragraphs, which are offered as a preparatory proposal only, must be very speculative in nature. A first, straightforward response would be to classify media scientists such as Kittler as latter‐day Hobbesians; if war is enthroned as the natural state of being, then the—technologically updated—martial a priori is beyond discussion.35 The second, more cautious response would consist in pointing out that Kittler, rather than propagating the timeless dominance of war, is hinting at an increasing, rather than a timeless, importance of military technology. At one point in time the ongoing interaction between technologies and strategies, military hardware and software, emerged as an autonomous process that relegated the hitherto dominant social or economic factors to the back seat of history. Obviously, this response would require substantial historical analyses as to how, when, and why this basic shift is supposed to have occurred—not to mention the fact that historicizing an a priori on this fundamental level is bound to turn into an exercise in self‐contradiction. It would, however, correspond to Kittler’s recent endorsement of Ernst Kapp, the nineteenth‐century German‐Texan Hegelian, geographer, and spa owner, who was not only the first philosopher of technology to spell out the notion that tools are organ projections but who was the first to hint that tools will and can produce tools.36 The autonomy of martial escalation corresponds to the take‐off of a technological evolution that leaves toolmaking humans behind.</p>
         <p>The third—and possibly most productive—combines the first two. Much of Kittler’s recent work centers on the obvious parallel between the evolution of media from storage and communication to computation and cryptography on the one hand and the growing importance to the military of electronic warfare on the other. Increasingly, war centers not on the destruction of personnel and hardware (as we all know, killing people is mere “collateral damage”) but on the most efficient ways of intercepting the enemy’s information and communicating one’s own. After a long reliance on animate and inanimate hardware, the informational aspects of war come to the fore, operating at speeds and in channels that require ever more efficient media interfaces and that soon may dispense with humans altogether. Just as all the preceding media are sublated in the digital <italic>über</italic>medium of the computer, all social processes are now clearly harnessed and regulated by the mechanisms of the war machine. As a complex system, war appears to operate much like life itself; it engages in the continuous extraction of information, it uses that information to devise protocols for the further gathering of information and the subsequent extraction and processing of material flows, and its developments depend on the degree to which individual units (tribes, collectives, cooperations, armies, nations, alliances) try to outdo each other. War—in the broadest sense of the word—has always fuelled media, but it is only recently that the isomorphy between war and basic processes of life appears to have become so obvious.37</p>
         <p>But to resume the inside view of the martial a priori: war serves as the prime technohistorical catalyst and hence as the explanatory backdrop of media evolution; media evolution, in turn, explains epistemological patterns and ruptures. The evolution of the human subject—Foucault’s appearing and disappearing “man”—is tantamount to the construction of an operator that can be disciplined into self‐determination up to the point where it is prepared to die or can be replaced by more reliable machine subjects. It is here that the full explanatory power of war within this theoretical framework reveals itself. By unfolding the increasingly technological materialities of communication, of which Foucault occasionally spoke but did not analyze, and relating them to the mechanism of martial escalation, German media scientists such as Kittler evolved their own link between archeology and genealogy; that is, they fused war to its discursive effects by examining the mechanisms and technologies of inscription, physical disciplining, and surveillance that connect the two.</p>
         <p>This may help address the objection regarding the nonmilitary origins of nineteenth‐century storage technology. It is important to remember that the story Kittler tells is not one of new technologies dropping out of the sky or from the foreheads of pioneering engineers. The fact that Edison was a brilliant tinkerer is less important than the fact that he was partly deaf. The “immaterials of scientific origin” that stood at the beginning of the new storage media were linked to the existence and, subsequently, the scientific study of, physical handicaps (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 29). Among the remembered and forgotten early media pioneers, from Edison and Bell to Charles Cros and Rasmus Malling Hansen, so many were either afflicted or working with those who were that researchers like Kittler were able to extrapolate a general rule: Media that make us hear, see, and speak better were developed by and for those who heard, saw, and spoke less. <disp-quote>
               <p>When, from the point of view of brain physiology, language works as a feedback loop of mechanical relays, the construction of typewriters is only a matter of course. Nature, the most pitiless examiner, paralyzes certain parts of the brain through strokes and bullet wounds to the head; research (since the Battle of Solferino in 1859) is only required to measure the resulting interferences in order to distinguish the distinct subroutines of speech in anatomically precise ways. Sensory aphasia (while hearing), dyslexia (while speaking), agraphia (while writing) bring forth machines in the brain.… Blindness and deafness, precisely when they affect either speech or writing, yield what would otherwise be beyond reach: information on the human information machine. Whereupon its replacement by mechanics can begin. [<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 189]</p>
            </disp-quote> Leaving aside the problematic association of “bullet wounds” with “nature,” a clear sequence emerges: a focus on handicap‐induced foregrounding of psychophysical processes allows for their scientific isolation in laboratory conditions, which, in turn, prepares for their technical isolation and reproduction as facilitated by phonographic and photographic media.38 Brain damage engenders media—according to Kittler, this is precisely the story told by Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage” (on <italic>Dark Side of the Moon</italic>). From the scrutinized, territorialized “loonies” outside who have to be kept “on the path” to the deterritorialized explosion of cloud and thunder “in your ear,” the song retraces the development of recording technology with the hi‐fi schizophonia of sounds, noises, and voices that are removed from bodies and synthesized, as it were, inside the brains of listeners on their media trip to the dark side of the moon.39 </p>
         <p>Handicaps, then, “isolate and thematize sensory data streams” that subsequently are subject to mechanical reproduction (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 23). And while some mistake this “replacement by mechanics” with an extension of the human body and its sensory apparatus, the real goal is not to provide a prosthesis but to discipline and mobilize bodies and senses according to the dictates of a military regime. Movement is analyzed beyond the capabilities of human perception in order to optimize the moving human machine, be it for assembly lines, parades, or coordinated attacks. The most prominent example is the militarization of perception as detailed in the “dromological” analyses by Paul Virilio, which have been adopted by German media scientists, though few of them share Virilio’s bleak, apocalyptic view of new technology. For Virilio, the very core of military intelligence is to increase and accelerate all visual and cognitive faculties engaged in observing the enemy. From the use of high ground to the technologically facilitated ability to extend human perception, war acts as a voyeur who above all wants to see better and faster than others. The increasing militarization of perception is already contained in the early history of cinematography, with its fusion of cameras and airplanes and its sustained bombardment of the sensory apparatus. In an analysis that closely resembles Kittler’s, the movie palaces of the 1920s are described as cathedrals of light in which war, as it were, hibernates and prepares its subjects for its next outing. What the Gulf War with its collapsing of TV footage into military targeting images proved was the ongoing media‐induced conflation of seeing and killing; inverting Berkeley’s <italic>esse est percipi</italic> the new military entertainment complex dictates that <italic>percipi est morire</italic>. To be seen is to die because it implies that one has not managed to hide or that one has fallen behind the new media dictates of speed and perception.</p>
         <p>The latter, however, already presupposes technological advances that have not only replaced human perception with more effective cameras and monitors but that have also converted thinking itself into computing. For Kittler, the crucial point is the war‐induced development of conditional jump instructions, that is, the development of feedback loops. “IF a preprogrammed condition is missing, data processing continues according to the conventions of numbered commands, but IF somewhere an intermediate result fulfills the condition, THEN the program itself determines successive commands, that is, its future” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 258). In other words, feedback distinguishes computers from mere calculating machines in much the same way as human discourse is distinguished from animal language. Quoting Lacan’s distinction between human and animal language, Kittler offers a construction of modern missiles as the functional equivalent of the human subjects programmed to kill other human subjects: <disp-quote>
               <p>While the messages of one bee control the flight of another to blossoms and prey, these messages are not decoded and transmitted by the second bee. By contrast, “the form in which language is expressed … itself defines subjectivity. Language says: ‘You will go here, and when you see this, you will turn off there.’ In other words, it refers itself to the discourse of the other.”</p>
            </disp-quote> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>In yet other words: bees are projectiles, and humans, cruise missiles. One is given objective data on angles and distances by a dance, the other, a command of free will. Computers operating on IF‐THEN commands are therefore machine subjects. Electronics, a tube monster since Bletchley Park, replaces discourse and programmability replaces free will. [<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 259]</p>
            </disp-quote> This does not mean that computers and cruise missiles are artificial human brains or that they mechanically implement human thought; rather, they optimize nonhuman patterns of thinking that also were imposed on human beings. Machine subjects have ousted human subjects as the prime programmable operators of modern war because they are far better equipped to receive, process, and execute “the language of the upper echelons of leadership” that is “always digital” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 249). This, then, is the third and most important sequence: within the realm of the “discourse network 1800,” early print‐ and telegraphy‐facilitated campaigns created a human subject that subsequently was taken apart by the analogous media in the “discourse network 1900” and finally replaced by the digital media of the “DN 2000.”40 </p>
         <p>In retrospect, it appears almost inevitable that discourse analysts—especially those who choose to focus on material and medial conditions—should exhibit such a marked preference for war, that is, for an environment in which political, administrative, and technological command structures are at their most transparent, effective, and apodictic. Simply put, war appears to reduce discourse to a set of commands; and thus it throws into sharp relief the modern disciplining techniques that evolved from control and punishment to reliable self‐guidance or, in Kittler’s words, from simple threats and commands to “a command of free will.” It comes as no surprise that some theorists have argued that modern disciplining techniques such as those described by Foucault originated in the military sector. The pronouncement by Nietzsche, the first master of modern genealogy, that “war itself … has provided all the <italic>forms</italic> that punishment has assumed throughout history” has had a long afterlife.41 Just as the military structure, far from being a foreign element within the social body, reveals discursive power at its clearest, so does war expose the true relationship between humans and technology. The cunning of military‐technological reason, however, was to have the digital simulation of so‐called thought preceded by the isolation of the psychophysical processes in the shape of analog media. These media appeared to act as extensions and prostheses and thus reinforced the anthropocentric view at exactly the time when the analysis of brain functions put an end to the philosophical dreams of soul and self‐conscious subjectivity. Here we have the full explanatory power of war. It not only serves to account for the discontinuities within Foucault’s archeology, it also takes care of discontinuities between discourse analysis and the genealogy of disciplining technique (so problematic to the many commentators who wish Foucault had pursued a more streamlined career).42 Or, to leave Foucault aside and concentrate on the issues at hand, war emerges as the ground for technological evolution as well as that of the formation, deconstruction, and ultimate replacement of human subjects.</p>

               <p>It is important to reiterate this point. Theorists like Kittler, Siegert, or Dotzler are not preaching the old gospel of media‐as‐prosthesis. Rather, what they have in mind is a threefold relationship that leaves this type of anthropomorphic extension far behind. (1) There is a supplementary relationship between tools and the body in the sense that the former were not consciously designed to extend and enhance the physical or intellectual capabilities of humans. On the contrary, just as we do not know what language is before we have writing (that is, we introspect language in the terms of the writing system we happen to have internalized), it is only by virtue of these tools that we come to conceptualize human capabilities. This is the background of Kittler’s notion that Edisonian media of the late nineteenth century are responsible for our (technology‐based) understanding of our psychophysical processes. (2) Most organ projection theories tacitly assume an unchanging human feature or capability. German media scientists would be the first, and the loudest, to point out that there is a constant feedback that fundamentally affects that which is said to be the origin of its extensions. (3) As already pointed out in connection with Kapp (see footnote 36 above), the evolution of tools is, sooner or later, an autonomous process, in the course of which humans may or will become parts of complex technological systems.</p>

               <p>It is, of course, possible to turn the tables on Kittler and other poststructuralist media theorists and perform a Foucauldian analysis of the medial a priori. This was recently undertaken by Dierk Spreen, who responds to the media‐theoretical take on discourse analysis with a “discourse‐analytical” take on media theory. The basic point is to show how media, rather than being the ground for symbolic production, move into its place within the discursive economy and thus inherit the contradictions of the symbolic a priori. Interestingly enough, Spreen also ends up by assigning a central position to war as paradigmatic for social self‐descriptions. See Dierk Spreen, <italic>Tausch, Technik, Krieg: Die Geburt der Gesellschaft im technisch‐medialen Apriori</italic> (Hamburg, 1998).</p>

         <title>Connections, Resistance, and Conclusion: Sympathy for the Devil</title>
         <p>Revealing subjects as fleeting vapors that arise from the friction of bodies, words, and technologies; endowing military technology and disciplining procedures with all the powers and privileges of a new subject of history—this project can be (and has been) dismissed as bellicose technodeterminist antihumanism. As justified as the objection may be, it is unproductive as long as it assumes the shape of a label that appears to allow critics to dispense such conjectures without further analysis. What I am suggesting are certain more productive interpretations.</p>
         <p>1. With regard to the overall importance of the military, Kittler and like‐minded scholars are closest to Virilio. To be sure, very few of them, if any, share the religious sentiment pervading Virilio’s more recent texts, but it is difficult to underestimate the importance of some of his earlier writings, in particular his analysis of speed as a function of power and the militarization of perception. With regard to the larger process in which media technologies vie for supremacy, it is not difficult to see the influence of some of the ideas—though certainly not of all—elaborated by Harold Innis in <italic>The Bias of Communication</italic> and <italic>Empire and Communications</italic>. The “rhythm of escalating answers” Kittler talks about is closely related to Innis’s notion that, as if mimicking a script coauthored by Marx and Hegel, media monopolies will give rise to their antagonistic successors. Kittler’s “strategic escalation” from the storage technology of World War I to the communications technology of World War II and the digital domain of World War III bears more than a passing resemblance to Innis’s dialectical evolution from papyrus to parchment and then to paper.</p>
         <p>2. One of the main starting points of Kittler’s theory was to use as well as explain Foucauldian discontinuity. Here, a very interesting parallel emerges between Kittler’s work and that of Keith Hoskin. Whereas Kittler links the Foucauldian discontinuity around 1800 to medial change, Hoskin relates it to the powerful effects of changes in educational practices. What media are to Kittler, education is to Hoskin; both are applying a Foucault‐inspired genealogical perspective to the archeological analyses of Foucault. Hoskin is nothing if not exact; with fantastic precision he locates the origin of the switch from the “Classical” to the “Modern” episteme in Adam Smith’s classrooms in Edinburgh, Gaspard Monge’s laboratory in Paris, and—Kittlerians would be delighted—the literary seminars of Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen, characterized by their grammatocentric emphasis on writing, self‐evaluation, and new examination procedures. Both Hoskin and Kittler, then, agree that the transformation into the new disciplinary world is fundamentally tied to “a new way of learning to learn,”43 but what makes the parallel so particularly attractive is Hoskin’s claim that these new educational practices were introduced to the United States by Sylvanus Thayer, the superintendent at West Point. Subsequently, West Point graduates who ventured into the business world used this new grammatocentric procedures “to construct a new ‘real world’ of business.”44</p>
         <p>3. This leads us directly to the third, most promising parallel. Both the work of Kittler and Hoskin can be subsumed by James Beniger’s attempt to explain the rise of the information society in terms of an ongoing spiral made up of a sequence of control crises triggering subsequent control revolutions. Beniger’s basic premise is that national economies (in analogy to living organisms and—incidentally—also to military units) constitute open processing systems that sustain themselves by engaging in the continuous extraction, reorganization, and internal distribution of environmental input. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century these functions were still carried out on a more or less human pace, with processing speeds enhanced only slightly by draft animals and wind or water power, and controlled by modest bureaucratic structures. With the wide‐scale harnessing of inanimate energy sources commonly known as the Industrial Revolution, however, the new, steam‐driven “processing of material flows threatened to exceed, in both volume and speed, the capacity of technology to contain them.”45 In simple terms, suddenly too many people were moving too fast on too many railroads; likewise, too many goods were being produced too rapidly and offered for consumption. This control crisis, which swept in rapid succession through the transportation, distribution, production, and consumption sectors of society, had to be countered by a control revolution, that is, by a complex of rapid changes in the technological and economic arrangements by which information is collected, stored, processed, and communicated and through which formal or programmed decisions can affect societal control.</p>
         <p>To take one historically important example: Following several spectacular train accidents in the 1840s, it became necessary to implement far‐reaching hardware and software changes. The hardware changes consisted of laying double tracks and setting up telegraph lines to control train movements; the software innovation consisted of a complete overhaul of the railway companies, which many economic historians, most notably Alfred Chandler, see as the germ cell of the managerial revolution of the nineteenth century that replaced Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand with the Visible Hand of management.46 On the one hand, bureaucratic control structures were expanded to secure a reliable two‐way information flow; on the other hand, it was realized that the speed and complexity of the railways escaped the control of too‐centralized structures, hence the managerial apparatus was reconfigured into functionally differentiated units, many of which were given greater independence within certain parameters of directives. Thus, control of each train was allocated to its conductor who, between the origin and destination, controlled all operations and was authorized to reach his own decisions whenever something unforeseen occurred. Conductors were, in Beniger’s words, “the first persons in history to be used as programmable, distributed decision makers” who might easily “have been replaced by on‐board micro‐computers or, given modern telecommunications, by a more centralized means of computer control”—a civilian equivalent of Kittler’s replacement of human subject by self‐guiding cruise missiles.47 I believe that rather than trying to link up Kittler and the media scientists with Niklas Luhmann, the machinic labyrinths of Deleuze and Guattari, or even with Jacques Derrida, this connection with Beniger is far more promising. To be sure, the more resolute emphasis on the martial a priori will not survive, but Kittler and Beniger agree in the overall importance of training humans to be programmable operators. Here, Kittler (along with Hoskin) would be able to add to the more economic analyses of Beniger a technologically equally sophisticated look at cultural training programs.48</p>
         <p>In conclusion—and to return to the beginning of this essay—what of the political implications? Is all the emancipatory potential inherent in the migration from the social to the technologically beneficial lost? Obviously, a theorist like Kittler—with his self‐confessed “eighty percent complete identification with the (technological) aggressor” and his 20 percent hope to fool the machines—offers little hope or possibility of resistance.49 Ironically, Kittler’s recent writings on software and the ways in which the computer industry systematically keeps everyday users from having any access to what is going on inside their equipment are nothing if not political. As I have argued elsewhere, Kittler at times comes across as a latter‐day Luther, a grammatocentric iconoclast who challenges the disenfranchising and stupefying multitude of icons and windows emanating from Redmond, Washington with the insistence that users should learn austere text‐based programming for themselves.50 What is more revealing, however, is that resistance, when it is at all mentioned, is discussed in the context of rock music’s abuse of army equipment.</p>
         <p>If Foucault, in Kittler’s words, “merely had to look things up” while seated in the archives of Uppsala, Paris, or Berkeley to discover the regulated practices that account for statements, then Kittler merely had to sit down and listen to records and CDs in Freiburg, Bochum, or Berlin in order to conceive of a martial history of rock music (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 5). Discourse analysis’s finest hour came when the words of the Rolling Stones’s song of songs, “I rode a tank / held a general’s rank / when the blitzkrieg raged / and the bodies stank,”51 were referred straight back to the war‐propelled development of VHF radio that enabled, first, General Guderian’s panzer tactics and, second, rock music’s guidance of motorized “tourist divisions, which under so‐called postwar conditions rehearse or simulate the blitzkrieg” (<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 108). No doubt, insisting on the military nature of media will help to preclude activist claims that media have a social potential that is waiting to be revealed; but it does so because the very technology itself—and not the emancipated consciousness of the critical user who waits for the right historical moment to unleash its emancipatory powers—offers a possibility of resistance: <disp-quote>
               <p>If “control,” or, as engineers say, negative feedback, is the key to power in this century, then fighting that power requires positive feedback. Create endless feedback loops until VHF or stereo, tape deck or scrambler, the whole array of world war army equipment produces wild oscillations … <italic>Play to the powers that be their own melody</italic> [<italic>GFT</italic>, p. 110; my emphasis]</p>
            </disp-quote> 
            <italic>Den Mächten die eigene Melodie vorspielen</italic>—this hidden Marx quote from the introduction to the “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law” is not altogether inappropriate, at least insofar as technical evolution, within the confines of media science, is the functional equivalent of the productive forces in dialectical‐historical materialism.52 Resistance cannot work outside of this evolution because the forces themselves, in a process of escalating contradictions, prepare the ground for radical change. One can, at best, add to an already ongoing dynamic. More important, this particular use of positive feedback—as exploited by Laurie Anderson, William Burroughs, “Lennon, Hendrix, Barrett,” and others—reveals that underneath the extreme tale of the dominance of war and media two fairly conventional narratives survive (<italic>GFT</italic>, pp. 110–11). The first concerns the immanence of resistance. There is no outside, or, rather, there is only an outside from imposed meaning but not from the circuits that mediate and structure meaning; hence any struggle can only take place firmly within the confines of the (technological) system. The second is a tale from the sixties and early seventies. In recent interviews, Kittler likes to point out (not without a certain provocative intent) that during the bygone days of the German student protest he preferred to listen to Pink Floyd than to read the <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic>. But while the politicized aspirations of the protest generation are disavowed, the positive feedback principles narrow the gap between Horkheimer/Adorno and Waters/Barrett, as what Kittler appears to be recycling is the venerable rebellious belief in the emancipatory destructive potential of counterculture. Once again, Charly’s analysis is on target. If there is no war, create an intense, existential, and tragic substitute in hi‐fi. It has been said and sung that rock’n’roll will never die. Media science offers the explanation that this is so because it is rooted in technologies that make its listeners die instead—a diagnosis that more often than not is met with baffled hostility. Such a response is understandable but not very productive—certainly no more productive than the indignation of the parents of the first generation of rock ’n’ roll listeners to turn up the volume.</p>

               <p>This attempt to counter Kittler with Beniger was first suggested by Jochen Schulte‐Sasse, “Von der schriftlichen zur elektronischen Kultur: Über neuere Wechselbeziehungen zwischen Mediengeschichte und Kulturgeschichte,” in <italic>Materialität der Kommunikation,</italic> ed. Gumbrecht and Pfeiffer (Frankfurt am Main, 1988), pp. 429–35. I first tried this link‐up by attempting to complement Kittler’s reading of Bram Stoker’s <italic>Dracula</italic> with a Benigerian perspective in “Undead Networks: Information Processing and Media Boundary Conflicts in <italic>Dracula,</italic> ” in <italic>Literature and Science,</italic> ed. Donald Bruce and Anthony Purdy (Amsterdam, 1994), pp. 107–29.</p>

               <p>“Every sphere of German society must be shown as the <italic>partie honteuse</italic> of German society; these petrified relations must be forced to dance by singing their own tune to them! The people must be taught to be <italic>terrified</italic> at itself in order to give it <italic>courage</italic>” (Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, <italic>Collected Works,</italic> trans. Clemens Dutt et al., 49 vols. to date [Moscow, 1975–], 3:178). Possible translation with an eye to media theory: Every sphere of technology has to be shown as suffused by the military; this has to be revealed by exposing and (out)performing its military logic. The people must be made aware of the terrifying nature of their means in order to enable them to use them more courageously.</p>
