<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. Kenneth Waters and Albert Van Helden, Eds., Julian Huxley: Biologist and Statesman of Science (Houston: Rice University Press, 1992), xii + 344 pp., $32.50. This long-overdue volume was worth the wait. Using eleven substantive papers and eight thoughtful commentaries, Waters and Van Helden have assembled a significant contribution to the biography of Julian Huxley, one of several much-noticed but thinly examined characters in twentieth-century Anglo-American biology. Colin Divall opens the book's first segment by grounding Huxley within British intellectual history. Huxley appears to Divall as an Edwardian struggling to modernize for the benefit of post-World War I mentalities. Tracing these changes gives an ancestry to Huxley's progressive thought as much as it gives that thought a temporal dynamic. Divall nicely demonstrates how strains of British idealism affected Huxley's faith in rational planning and scien- tific humanism. Commentaries by Peter Stansky and Martin Wiener add useful clarification. As a trio, the papers by J. A. Witkowski and Frederick Churchill together with Elof Carlson's commentary finally move scholar- ship on Huxley's studies of development past Baker's basic sketch (John R. Baker, "Julian Sorell Huxley," Biog. Mem. F.R.S., 22 [1976], 207-238). Witkowski emphasizes the results of Huxley's research and ably connects the development studies to other</page><page sequence="2">364 The J.H.B. Bookshelf elements of the biologist's unending search for general principles. Carlson's insightful commentary asks about focus: Why did Huxley choose to study development, when the center of attention (in Carlson's estimation) should have been genetics (Those interested in this question must read Jonathan Harwood's Styles of Scientific Thought: The German Genetics Community [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993].) Frederick Churchill, who also intro- duced the reprint of Huxley's book on relative growth (Frederick Churchill, "On the Road to the k Constant: A Historical Intro- duction," in Julian Huxley, Problems of Relative Growth, reprint ed. [1932]; Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993], pp. xix-xlv), offers a rich analysis of Elements of Experi-mental Embryology, describing it as "a synthesis of major daring and scope" that ultimately was "unsuccessful in providing a compre- hensive model". These three essays give definition to more than a decade of Huxley's research interests that frequently is disre- garded by scholars. Huxley studied animal behavior too. Richard Burkhardt critically assesses Huxley's oft-repeated claim to have sired ethology. Arguing that Huxley followed rather than set a new approach to behavior study - one aimed toward "learning something about bird life" - Burkhardt points to the naturalists Edmund Selous and H. Eliot Howard for Huxley's inspiration. Despite denying him the role of foundation builder, Burkhardt recognizes his impact as an advocate who actively supported organizations and researchers while the discipline gained coherence. John Durant depicts Huxley's ethological work as a search for ways of resolving "fundamental tensions" between purposeless mechanisms in evolution and the reality of progress. He also raises interesting questions about the relation between Huxley's ethological style and the "distinctly Edwardian genre of anthropomorphic animal biography." Solly Zuckerman's recollections flavor these fine essays. While adding importantly to the historiography of evolutionary studies, essays by Robert Olby, William Provine, and John Beatty treat Huxley's evolutionary research rather narrowly. As part of an insightful sketch of twentieth-century evolutionary theory, Olby fittingly paints Huxley outside professional evolutionists. His dif- ferences with the Oxford school, his generalist perspective, his emphasis on progress, and his frequent lack of institutional con- nection served to marginalize him in crucial respects. In contrast, Provine represents Huxley as a key insider, whose skills as a generalist allowed him to integrate the research results of his day into a coherent theoretical synthesis. In this essay, however, he emphasizes the cultural values built into Huxley's understanding of</page><page sequence="3">The J.H.B. Bookshelf 365 evolution. Somewhat out-of-place is a detailed elaboration of the (now) well-known constriction thesis that Provine advocates. Partially in response to Provine, Beatty unravels Huxley's under- standing of evolutionary mechanisms as expressed in Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. Seeing a "multiformity of evolution," Huxley argued for a plurality of evolutionary mechanisms, sup- posing "different kinds" of evolution in different groups and setting the direction of evolutionary biology toward exploring those many mechanisms. Where Provine emphasizes the loss of theory types, Beatty convincingly uses Huxley's emphasis on explanatory diver- sity within theory types to challenge the conformity supposed under the constriction thesis. Huxley's devotion to progress and scientific humanism flavored his approach to evolution. They also flavored his defense of eugenics. Garland Allen provides a thorough exegesis of Huxley's eugenic views during the 1930s and 1940s, raising significant ques- tions about the place of variability and population dynamics in different eugenic philosophies. Huxley's version of eugenics was complex: it was skeptical about comparing inheritance over dif- ferent environments, and it was (unevenly) critical of descriptive categories such as race. Allen ably moves through this complexity. Useful context is provided by Diane Paul's survey of reformed eugenicists and by Elazar Barkan's critical discussion of Paul's analysis. Barkan also raises the issue of incongruities found in Huxley's liberalist elitism. Daniel Kevles surveys Huxley's writings for general audiences. As a synopsis, this essay shows the considerable range of Huxley's pen (and voice) as he translated professional research for other audi- ences while also commenting upon political and cultural issues of his day. D. L. LeMahieu's commentary is indispensable for similar studies in the future, raising crucial questions about the nature of Huxley's audience. To be sure, Huxley enjoyed consid- erable renown - many recognized his name - but, LeMahieu points out, his success as a popularizer seems narrowly focused upon the Anglo-American liberal intelligentsia. Meanwhile Robert Patten's commentary reminds us that Huxley's general-audience material carried cultural and intellectual baggage from premodern times. No book could possible cover Huxley comprehensively. Never- theless, several valuable opportunities are lost here. Importantly, Huxley appears as a thinker and researcher whose goal was to add to knowledge or to create and justify policies - but he also was an administrator of knowledge and a public personality, having significant roles in the organization and operation of science's infra-</page><page sequence="4">366 The J.H.B. Bookshelf structure. Likewise, Huxley put science at the center of his political and cultural activity. Little is made of Huxley as a social actor. For instance, there is sustained analysis of neither the UNESCO years nor the "zoo job," leaving the "statesman of science" element of this book sadly underdeveloped. Tensions also transcend this collection, as Waters's fine intro- duction describes. The contributors disagree, for example, about what central themes guided Huxley's work. They also treat his commitment to progress in uncomfortably dissimilar ways. Further, Huxley moved continuously over many social circles, and his several reputations rose and fell on different patterns; except for Olby, this complicated element of Huxley's life is hardy noticed. Specialists, of course, will find lapses and quibbles in each essay. But significant insights are here too. Together with ongoing schol- arship elsewhere, this volume moves the biography of Huxley along rather nicely. Moreover, for the Huxley novice and the basic history- of-biology market, it provides a superb introduction to the ideas and life of this fascinating human. Joseph Cain</page></plain_text>
