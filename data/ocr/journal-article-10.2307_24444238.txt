<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mysticism and Dissent. Religious Ideology and Social Protest in the Sixteenth Century. By Stephen E. Ozment. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973. Pp. xiii, 270. $10.00.) One of the distinctive characteristics of Christian history is the way in which bodies of Christian believers throughout the centuries sought to renew or "reform" the established orthodoxies for their failure to live up to the assumed ideals of Christian vision. In general, those who strove for a perfected Christian achievement may be said to fall into three categories. First, and perhaps most obviously, were those millenarians in the tradition of Joachim of Flora, Anabaptist militants, or the extreme chiliastic sectaries of the English civil wars. In the second category were those who believed Christ's kingdom to be less imminent but, nonetheless, inevitable. Finally, there were those who fell into neither of the preceding categories, but who, at the same time, believed that perfection in this world might be accomplished by direct or mystical communion of individuals with the divine. All three of these categories were and are important elements of Christian experience whose influence has varied greatly according to time and place but whose effects, on occasion, have been felt with such extraordinary force as to create a seeming discontinuity in the history of Christianity. The work under review seeks to explain the peculiar forcefulness of one of these categories; namely, the mystical tradition and, particularly, its devastating, almost nihilistic assault upon the traditional institutional forms and ideas of Christianity during the sixteenth century. The author's contention is that the various forms of extreme dissent during that period are traceable to medieval mysticism, whose most important instrument of transmittal was the Theologia Deutsch or German Theology, which was the title given to this anonymous work by Luther in the versions of it he edited in 1516 and 1518. Who its author was is still a matter of speculation, although scholarly consensus traces it back to an unknown writer of the late fourteenth century. Ozment's study is an attempt, on the whole persuasive, to trace the influence 505</page><page sequence="2">The Historian of the German Theology on the most important leaders of religious dissent during the sixteenth century. As he sees it, the German Theology, with its explicit emphasis on the possibility of individual perfection and upon the ability of the individual man to comprehend the intentions of divine will, was a kind of ecumenical treatise against the repressive authority of an intellectualized theology and traditional institutions. While Luther, for example, made use of it in his attack on Rome's historic claims to authority, he did not see that the German Theology was a doubled-edged weapon that could be and was used against his own theological ecclesiastical position, as it was later to be used against those of Calvin and Zwingli. Thus it was that the anonymous tract came to undergird the arguments of every major dissenter who attacked the ills and evils of the established order and sought to replace it with a final authority, which "lay in principle with the individual, the ethically ideal, the perfect community â€” things no earthly society could ever be" (247). The result of this restatement of anthropomorphic hope and faith in the immanence of the divine was certainly more far-reaching than the chronological limits of the sixteenth century. The author hints at its effects but says little about them in an Epilogue which is perhaps too brief for the context of his argument. Is there not here the continuation of a powerful set of assumptions reaching even farther back into the Christian past than the Middle Ages? Could it not also be argued that the assumptions are with us yet in the form of a secularized, anthropomorphic, libertarian aspiration that recalls the perennial hope of an earthly Jerusalem? If this is a shortcoming, the work is still a most useful contribution to what may be called the history of historical assumption. Boston University Sidney A. Burrell</page></plain_text>
