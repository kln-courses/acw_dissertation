<plain_text><page sequence="1">(135) A BRONZE STATUETTE OF ATUM By JOHN BAINES IN June 1969 the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, bought a bronze statuette of Atum (no. 1969. 490),' which appears to be unique among anthropomorphic bronzes of this god in being named on , the base, although others have been published as Atum or ascribed to him (there are two inscribed figures in other materials, referred to below). The piece is said to come from an 'old private collection in Cairo', and has evidently been out of the ground a long time, as the metal is 'dead'. It has at some time been cleaned by crude mechanical means, another indication pointing in the same direction. The figure is hollow cast and the condition of the metal is good. The only major fault is a disease patch which has caused a hole in the right elbow (this does not pene- trate the full depth of the bronze, and may ultimately be due to a casting fault), and also affected the profile of the nhih-flail, whose corner has been rounded with plaster in modern times (details are visible on the photographs of front and back, pl. LXIII, I, 2). The height of the statuette, from the foot of the base to the top of the dorsal pillar, is 23*5 cm.; as can be seen in pl. LXIII, 3 the t of the double crown is a few millimetres higher. The base is o08 cm. high and 5 cm. wide at the front (narrower at the back). The width at the widest point of the figure, the elbows, is approximately 7-75 cm. The workmanship is good, but for a bronze of its size and probable date (see below) not of the highest class. A slight tentativeness in the treatment of the upper part may be the result of an unfamiliar subject: the surface here is not very smooth; with lips standing out further than is natural, it only looks successful from the front.2 Also, straight and symmetrical lines in the details are not very accurate, and the insignia are not well rounded; in addition, the hkk appears bent because of its disposition over the body. The surface condition will of course be partly the result of cleaning and preservation, though this is not true of flaws like the inconsistent clearing of the triangles formed by insignia, arms, and garments. The only further treatment the object has had in Oxford is a cleaning of the base to allow a better reading of the inscription. The statuette has a slightly non-'standard' iconography for Atum, which is, however, normal for the two essential elements, the double crown and the wig. Apart from cases where the iconography is governed by the context, and is frequently uniform for a whole group of figures, the only variant in the iconography of Atum is found in a group of bronzes showing him as an eel.3 The large majority of cases show him I I am grateful to the authorities of the Ashmolean Museum for permission to publish this piece, and for assistance, and also to Dr. J. R. Harris for much advice. 2 This phenomenon occurs on good-quality statues from other periods, e.g. B. V. Bothmer, 'Private sculp- ture of Dynasty XVIII in Brooklyn', The Brooklyn Museum Annual 8 (i968), 58, fig. 2: it is probably con- nected with the intended viewing direction of the figure. 3 H. W.

He does not always have a divine beard. The fact that he is not normally mummiform is relevant, as he is shown making use of his arms.' These remarks refer to two-dimensional representations; they need further definition; statues have not been considered, as more attribution is necessary.2 The form of this statuette is basically a combination of the attributes of Osiris and of Atum, the iconography below shoulder-level being that of Osiris. The figure is mummiform and has a covering garment which is only broken by the vertical slits through which the hands holding the insignia protrude. The feet are not characterized at all, as is normal with Osiris, while the legs are only slightly marked, and are rather unnaturally far apart-perhaps to give the figure a better side profile. The outward bulge of the calves is clearly visible from both sides. The knees are modelled at the front, and hinted at by a slight thinning at the back; the side outline, after narrowing a little at knee-level at the front, widens in a concave curve from this point to the elbows. Modelling of the knees tends to be characteristic of better-quality or larger-size bronzes of Osiris, and it will be clear from the description that the lower part of the figure is made with considerable competence. The right hand holds the nhihn, the left the hk;; the bottom of the hk4 hangs down to just above the level of the knees. The arms are horizontal from the elbows (the right perhaps slightly raised), and the upper arm, forming the side outline of the whole, slopes at about 70Â° up to the rounded shoulders. The back of the figure is dominated by a broadening dorsal pillar, running for its whole length, which leans backwards at a very slight angle; it is 1-75 cm. wide at the bottom end, and 2-25 cm. wide at the join with the wig, and stands away very little from the body (average 2-5 mm.). The buttocks are rather unnaturally placed to either side of the pillar, and from them upwards the modelling of the back is dictated by that of the front and has no physical or iconographic detail. At 1-85 cm. below the line of the shoulders there is a horizontal line on the dorsal pillar; above this widely spaced incised lines in an inverted U-pattern at the back indicate the divine wig. The wig is curved over, and well separated from, the forehead; from there it goes in a sickle- shaped line round the back of the ears down to the lappets. In front of the ears it is marked on the side of the face and comes down to the level of the middle of the ear, approximately that of the cheekbone, if it were visible: in other words, it has more or less the appearance of normal modern sideburns. The ears appear forced forward by the wig and protrude almost at right angles to the cheeks. Coming down to the lower edge of the wig in the middle of the forehead is a uraeus. The head of the uraeus curves forward at the same level as the base of the double crown. stone statuette, Vienna I062, should also be mentioned here; cf. Sethe, 'Atum als Ichneumon', ZAS 63 (1928), 50-3; Brunner-Traut, 'Spitzmaus und Ichneumon als Tiere des Sonnengottes', Nachr. Gottingen, Phil.-hist. Klasse, I965, 157-60. A further dedication to Atum is found on the base of a bronze, Cairo 30837, which was probably intended as a reliquary, and has figures of two lizards and a snake (Masson and Yoyotte, Objets pharaoniques a inscription carienne, 53, pis. 6-7; a varying translation of the dedication formula is also given here). The Carian inscription will date the piece to the Saite-Persian period. E.g. Piankoff, The Tomb of Ramesses VI, pl. 131. 3 A complementary article on aspects of the iconography of Atum is in preparation. 136 JOHN BAINES</page><page sequence="4">A BRONZE STATUEl"TT'E OF ATUM The beard has the normal outward-curving end, and is decorated with alternating diagonal incised lines: the end section has two vertical lines. It is not detached from the neck and body, and it sticks out in profile beyond the level of the face. At the juncture of the beard with the face the chin is cleft with a rather crude vertical stroke that also distorts the top of the beard: the impress of the tool is still present on the surface, which is not smoothed, and the cleft has not been worked into a realistic, i.e. smaller, shape. The lips, apart from protruding unnaturally, are flat and not shaped into a normal mouth profile. On both sides of the mouth pairs of lines curve up from slightly below and outside it in a convex line to the middle of the cheeks, a little above the level of the nostrils (pl. LXIII, 4). These lines indicate in an extremely stylized way the vertical age-lines produced in the face by smiling. The marking of this feature is common enough in Late-period portrait sculpture, but in stone it has the purpose of giving a sagging and careworn appearance to the face, which is not exactly comparable to the effect produced here; it is more 'abstract', as if the feature were allusive or iconographic rather than self-explanatory.' The lower part of the face shows no attaching strings for the beard; these, if they existed, would outline the jaw (no jaw- line can in fact be seen). The nose is straight and rather wide at the bottom; at the top, furrow lines on either side of it go up to the forehead. There is a slight, perhaps unintentional, suggestion of age-lines on the forehead, another characteristic of late portraits. The right eye is placed normally just next to the nose, while the left is, relatively, some distance over to the left. This is part of a general distortion of the upper part of the statuette which means that the vertical line of the face is out of true, running a little from left to right, and that the left side of the face is further forward than the right; also, the uraeus and t, of the double crown are placed to the right of the centre of the face. The treatment of the eyelids imitates inlay work, which is not true of the eyebrows. All these elements are continued, as is normal, some distance beyond the natural end of the sockets towards the ears. In front the eyebrow line makes a sharp angle which gives an impression of 'chiselled features'. In all, several features in the face show that it is, somewhat unusually for a divine figure, meant to portray (in a conventionalized way) someone old. The double crown is placed vertically on the head, with the line of its base horizontal. It is sited centrally on the wig rather than on the head. Its back line continues the line of the dorsal pillar, and therefore runs more or less vertically. Thus the crown differs from normal two-dimensional depictions of crowns in not sloping backwards and also in not being shaped at the bottom to fit the head: this last characteristic is due to the presence of the wig, and is normal for crowns on wigs. The combination of crown and wig is unwieldy, and would quite possibly be unwearable. So it is likely that when it is specific to the figure shown, as here and with the goddess Mut, and not used indiscriminately, as, for example, frequently in Ptole- maic temple reliefs, it represents a fusion of two iconographic elements, both of which have meaning. This can be shown to be the case, as with the Herculaneum statue2 1 The form these lines take may be partly conditioned by the material. 2 Botti, 'Statuetta del dio Atum da Ercolano', Bollettino d'arte 48 (Rome, 1963), 1-4. Botti calls this figure a statuette, but it is 90 cm. high and seated, and so in conventional terms a statue. I37</page><page sequence="5">which has the wig only; the double crown is common by itself. It is not, however, clear why it should be thought necessary to have wig and crown. So the iconography of our statuette is different from that of Osiris on the following points: (i) Bronzes of Osiris do not have a dorsal pillar: where these exist, e.g. in stone, they are often in more elaborate forms like obelisk or dd-pillar. (2) The figure is not wearing any neck decoration: this might in any case not be visible beneath the wig. (3) The shoulders at the back are not modelled with a high ridge, as is normal for mummiform Osiris or Ptah: I take this feature, when it is present, to represent some sort of stiffener to keep the body in shape.' (4) The face is that of an old man. (5) The headdress and wig are not those of Osiris. The iconography of this statuette is in all important respects the same as that of an uninscribed bronze in the Cairo Museum, no. 38421, published as Osiris.2 Unfor- tunately the back of the figure is not illustrated in the publication, so it is not possible to say if it has a dorsal pillar or not. The fact that there are two figures allows one to say that they form a type, obviously modified from the form of Osiris, but still a more or less integral conception, since the presence of the dorsal pillar distinguishes the whole and not just the top from Osiris; the lack of stiffener shows that the body is not a slavish imitation either.3 It is quite possible that further bronzes of this type exist in collections, categorized as Osiris. Roeder's standard work on bronzes4 says that the Cairo figure 'muss einen anderen Sinn haben', i.e. not be Atum, and this would tend to make collections ignore the distinction. Also, figures of Osiris-Moon (Wsir-irh) have the same iconographic possibilities apart from the crown; consequently damaged or incomplete figures could belong to either class. No further anthropomorphic metal statuette inscribed as Atum has been published, and I can only find three more which might be attributed on iconographic grounds. The first is mentioned by Roeder5 and needs no further comment here. The second is Cairo 38o05,6 a lead statuette of a standing anthropomorphic figure wearing a double crown, without a wig, holding no insignia, and wearing a normal loincloth. Botti7 refers to this figure as a bronze and states that there are some such (qualche); but the I Confusions do occur over these points. Perhaps the engraver of the pyramidion Durham I985 (De Meule- naere, 'Pyramidions d'Abydos', JEOL 20 (1967-8), pl. 7) was misled into calling Osiris what should be an Atum by the presence of a necklace and mnit-counterpoise. 2 G. Daressy, Statues de divinites, I 113, pi. 23. The face of this statuette shows no signs of age: in general it is not so carefully worked. The remaining inscribed figure of Atum, Tutcankhamun Carter 2goa (H. Murray and M. Nuttal, A Handlist to Howard Carter's Catalogue of Objects in TutrankhamuZn's Tomb, 12) is also mummiform, but this feature is consistent throughout a series of statuettes with different names. They have no distinctive insignia. 3 The stiffener should strictly belong only to dead bodies, and so not to Atum. 4 Agyptische Bronzefigurien, 29 Â§ 47. 5 Loc. cit., see also ibid. 31 Â§ 51 a.

I38 JOHN BAINES</page><page sequence="6">A BRONZE STATUE'l"I'E OF ATUM wording of his iconographic summary as a whole is so loose that it seems likely no precise meaning is to be attached to this; there are no references in the literature to suggest that the piece has many parallels. The remaining figure is in the Museo Civico at Reggio Emilia,I and comes from a Roman burial. It is presumably a Roman imitation of an Egyptian type, and the maker must have been uncertain what class was behind his model. The figure is mummiform and holds a w;s-sceptre against its body in the manner of figures of Ptah. It has a divine beard and a wig, and probably a dorsal pillar.2 The wig could be indicative of Atum, and the w?s-sceptre would not necessarily contradict this, while the dorsal pillar would support it; but at this small scale a more striking attribute like the double crown would seem more appropriate. The archetype could also be a syncretistic figure of Pth-tv-tnn whose crown was missing.3 One more figure, Cairo 38423,4 may conceivably be relevant: it shows a crouched mummiform figure with its fists clenched upright on its knees, wearing beard, wig, uraeus, and the base of what is probably a double crown. For Osiris this pose can more or less be paralleled in the gold triad in the Louvre,5 where, however, Osiris' hands are flat on his knees. Again it is un- certain whether Cairo 38423 has a dorsal pillar: the solution to this, and to whthter the crown-fragment is that ofa double crown can only be found by examining the object itself. The inscription on the Ashmolean statuette reads (fig. a d , r i): 'Atum give life (to) P,-di-ist son of Hrw-wadw.' The iL A text may be taken as indicative or optative though the latter obviously makes better sense. My translation is one of several possible; I know of no discussion of the grammar of this particular formula. The interpretation r y &lt; is chiefly based on two unpublished cases on statuettes from Saqqara, 1969-70 season, numbers H5-2134 and FIG. I H5-2I6I, where an n is placed between the di rnh and the personal name. The ease with which n is omitted in Late-period Egyptian suggests that it should be universally restored in the formula-as most translators do by implication. If the formula is under- stood thus it will be grammatically a sw sdm followed by object and dative n. The construction cannot then go back earlier than the New Kingdom, and the formula may well be later in origin like the general practice of dedicating small statuettes of divinities as well as statues of private individuals. It may ultimately be modelled on the di.f cnh was nb formula which accompanies divinities in temple scenes; the latter also occurs on bronzes.6 It has been suggested to me that the di rnh might have been understood by the user on the lines of the Coptic r&amp;n2o. This is perhaps not plausible in the Saite-Persian period, but might be later, and the formula continues well into the Graeco-Roman period. It would, of course, imply a Coptic state of the language where n is added before the direct object.

I39</page><page sequence="7">Two further points are worth making about the text. The filiation is given in the form son-father only (bronze inscriptions vary considerably in the amount of filiation they give). This may be a dating criterion. No dating conclusions can be drawn from the names themselves, though a superficial search revealed no father-son pair with these two names. The orthography of v (wrongly written ) for ; is worth noting; at least one other Hrw-wdiw written thus is known' from the Saite-Persian period, and the writing is an archaizing one typical of the time, which takes up one common in the Old Kingdom. This detail speaks quite strongly for a Saite dating of the piece. The orthography of e for w in initial position is unusual, but unrevealing. The style of the piece might make it possible to place it within narrower limits, but unfortunately there exists no classification of bronzes in this direction, and compari- sons with stone material are difficult because of the different aims and standards in the two media, and the difference in the media themselves. he most individual aspect of the figure is the face with its cleft chin, marks of age, and the detail of the wig forming a sideburn without any band at the front. This last feature may be rare with divine wigs, but I cannot trace tit for lack of published photographs. The cleft chin is very rare, while the agedness of the face could be said to be characteristic of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty or later from comparison with stone sculpture, but not given any closer date. In any case it probably has iconographic as well as stylistic significance, referring to Atum as the old man of the setting sun.2 As I have suggested above, this may influence the form of the markings. The age-lines near the mouth are in fact contrary in shape to what is found in stone sculpture, and are not realistic, Bothmer3 states that furrows between nose and eyebrows are 'familiar enough in Late por- traiture', but his catalogue itself shows rather few cases of them. I know of no other god who is shown as old. I am unable to say anything about the implications for dating of the treatment of details of the body. So it seems that the names and orthography, which both point to the Twenty sixth-Dynasty as the most probable date, with a possibility of the Twenty-seventh Dynasty, are the best indications we have. The existence of small statuettes of Atum raises problems concerning their purpose and use, as also is the case with other bronzes. However, no headway could be made with the scattered and partly unprovenanced material mentioned above, and a discus- sion of these questions does not belong here.
