Typographical errors are numerous; the potentially informative maps are very poorly executed, especially one that depicts the distribution of checklists but shows only the number of lists by grid unit without any reference outline drawing. The species frequency histograms could just as easily have been presented at a smaller scale as lines of varying width, darkness, or pattern, a move that would have shortened the work dra- matically. In sum, this is an excellent work, well worth owning. The reader must be prepared, however, to ignore the poor printing to get to the good biology.-Paul B. Hamel. 81. Optical Signals: Animal Communication and Light. J. P. Hailman. 1977. In- diana University Press, Bloomington. 362 p. $15.00-Optical signaling is a major vehicle for social communication in animals and therefore is central to the understanding of animal behavior. Hailman attempts to articulate the characteristics of optical signals and the factors that dictate their design by using physical science to explore the nature of optical signaling. He uses his own behavioral observations and some from the literature to test his predictions. This approach represents a unique integration of scientific expertise that is desirable and important for the analysis of behavior. Hailman's goal is to analyze optical signals used in social communication and to predict their characteristics. First he outlines his method of analysis, namely the cycle of scientific epistemology, which is the process of generating and testing models based on rigorous mathematical principles. Four classes of models describe the causes and origins of behavior at the individual (Control and Ontogeny) and population (Preservation and Phylogeny) level. Hailman uses these behavioral determinants throughout as a theme for outlining the factors involved in the communication process. Communication occurs when a sender initiates a physical disturbance (signal) in a channel that is detected by a receiver. Hailman discusses signals and information (Chapter 2) relative to the fields of semiotics, cybernetics (information theory), and ethology (control theory). Some aspects of these fields, such as uncertainty and entropy in communication, and behavioral vectors and matrices, were informative independently, but contributed little to the book's content, and might have been better left to another treatise. The types of communication are classified by the channel through which the signal passes, and by the communicants: the sender who generates the signal and the receiver who detects it. Chapter 3 addresses the optical channel and the physical properties of light, such as absorption, emission, reflection, transmission, and refraction. The charac- teristics of light as it is altered in the atmosphere are considered relative to the ambient light that falls on animals in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. This chapter is replete with technical information vital for comprehending subsequent chapters, but is sometimes difficult to follow. The necessary brevity in explaining these physical concepts may have obscured their meaning to many biologists. The sender (Chap. 4) transmits information by creating variation in the temporal and spatial patterning of light. Animals use bioluminescence and vary biochromes, schemo- chromes, and physical movement to produce signals. Intrinsic signals (the source of pat- terning is the sender itself) comprise the bulk of optical signals although extrinsic signals (produced by some object fashioned by the sender) also are used. The behavioral and morphological elements of these signals are outlined and their possible phylogenetic origins discussed. Signal-like behavior or pseudosignals (behavioral stereotypy and phys- ical characteristics evolved for reasons other than communication) are identified. Hailman discusses the receiver (Chap. 5) relative to the constraints placed on com- munication by its abilities to detect optical signals. The animal's photoreceptivity and physiological capabilities for visual perception and discrimination set limits on optical communication. Some animals use optical signals to deceive an observer (Chap. 6). They may suppress shadow and outline contrast or imitate some part of their environment. Animals remove consistency in what a receiver perceives by masking their symmetry, startle-deception, replicate-deception (producing copies of themselves in their environment), deceptive polymorphism, motion-deception, and/or combinations of these strategies. For intraspecific communication, animals may reverse the signal characteristics of deception to become</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 52, No. 2 Recent Literature [175 conspicuous. This is maximized by physical movement and by enhancing shape and con- trast. The characteristics of ambient light specific to habitat and background determine which aspects of conspicuousness are maximized. Transmission noise is any alteration of the signal that causes equivocation in the receiver. Signals must be designed to maximize spectral reflectivity in translucent media (such as fog, mist, or turbid water) or optimize the spatial arrangement of sender and receiver in opaque media (such as vegetated hab- itats). The conflict between concealment (e.g., from predators) vs. conspicuousness (e.g., to mates) may be resolved by efficient timing, changing the background, and general orientation of the sender with respect to the receiver. The relationship between the referent, the optical signal and the information it carries is discussed in Chapter 8. Hailman analyzes optical signals by using semantics and the indexic, iconic and symbolic information they carry, syntactics and the relations of signals to each other, and pragmatics as the evolutionary consequences of the signaling process. He classifies the types of animal behavior (agonistic, reproductive, and cooperative) and attempts to define the signal-characteristics of each type. Optical Signals concludes with a return to the 4 classes of behavioral determinants and a review of the problems in analyzing optical signals that emerged from Hailman's liter- ature search. Students of animal behavior who wish to ascribe "cause" to observed social behavior of animals are urged to read this book. A good methodical analysis of animal behavior should involve rigorous consideration of the biotic and abiotic components of that animal's experience. Hailman provides us with a useful guide and reference for analyzing the characteristics of optical signals.-Lise A. Hanners. 82. Greenshanks. D. Nethersole-Thompson and M. Nethersole-Thompson. 1979. Buteo Books, Vermillon, South Dakota. 275p. $27.50.-Desmond and Maimie Nethersole- Thompson achieve a rare blend of poetry and natural history. Their opening chapters evoke the harsh splendor of the Scottish moors, the exquisite beauty of the Greenshanks (Tringa nebularia), the joy, excitement, and frustration inherent in field work. These chapters dwell on the emotional satisfaction that is the field biologist's greatest reward, a point rarely evident in the scientific literature and still less often conveyed by under- graduate texts. With chapter 5 the emphasis shifts into a more scientific vein, but throughout the book the Nethersole-Thompsons convey an intense joy in the Greenshanks and all that is associated with them. Chapter 5 emphasizes individual variability by relating anecdotes from Desmond's 45 y of watching Greenshanks. Variability is an important biological principal, but the em- phasis it receives throughout Greenshanks may be excessive. Generalizations about the species' behavior, ecology, and population dynamics are possible and many generalizations are drawn, but become lost in the ensuing discussion of exceptions and anecdotes. More balance between generalization and anecdote is needed. Population dynamics are described in chapter 6 for the Sutherland and Spey Valley populations studied by the Nethersole-Thompsons and are described for the species gen- erally in chapter 17. The potential role of territory in population dynamics, discussed in chapters 6 and 8, is unclear. In some years there are floaters despite the fact that appar- ently suitable habitat is unoccupied. In other years floaters are absent and territorial males are unable to attract mates despite persistent display. The discussion of these matters is excellent and well supported with quantitative detail and anecdotes. The analysis of vocalizations (chap. 7) is simply outstanding. Vocalizations are named onomatopoetically and grouped functionally. The description of each vocalization is ac- companied by a sonogram that greatly enhances the verbal description. However there are some annoying problems, anthropomorphism beyond the bounds of poetic license, lack of quantitative detail on the use of the calls, and occasional loose reasoning such as when the authors suggest that the hen individually recognizes the cock merely because she looks up when he calls while flying overhead. She may, but she may look up in response to any sound overhead. Nonetheless the chapter contains much new material, is detailed, and most points are well documented.</page></plain_text>
