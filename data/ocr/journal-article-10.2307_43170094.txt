A look out the window reveals the perfect subject- the amusing, com- plex, and readily available squirrel. Ask students to describe typical be- haviors of their pets- tail-wagging, back-arching, meowing, growling. Next, ask students what they think these different behaviors might mean, whether hunger, fear, or pleasure, for example. Explain that many animals, including humans, communicate through sounds and actions. Let the children suggest several actions that humans use to communicate. How about smiling, pointing, and slamming the door? Ask students to describe sounds and actions they have noticed previously during their everyday ob- servations of squirrels. How do they think these sounds and actions help squirrels communicate? To the Field Scatter sunflower seeds on the ground or hang a corncob from a tree to attract squirrels to a particular area, prefera- bly one just outside your classroom window. That way students can watch from inside the room. Once the feed- ing area is well established, keep a record of the times during the day that the most squirrels come to eat, and schedule the following activity during the busiest time. Spying on Squirrels Data Chart Name Date Observations Frequency of Inferences Behavior Sounds (Verbal Behavior) Actions (Nonverbal Behavior) 34 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN SEPTEMBER 1991</page><page sequence="2">The grey squirrel is a familiar sight S 1 E CQ a 2 Have each student prepare a data chart. Then, take the class out to the squirrel observation area and instruct each child to focus on one particular squirrel. In the "Observations" column of the chart, each student should record every aspect of his squirrel's activity during a 10-minute period. Have stu- dents place a tally mark in the "Frequency" column every time they observe a particular sound or action. Remind students to use their sense of hearing as well as their sense of sight when making observations. As part of the exercise, students should describe the chattering and squawking sounds squirrels make in various situations - alone, confronted by another squirrel, or confronted by another animal, such as a bird. They should also note postures and actions, such as how the squirrel holds its food, flicks its tail, and raises its tail when it hears a noise. Back in the Classroom After the 10-minute observation period, return to the classroom and make a class list of the sounds (verbal behav- iors) and actions (nonverbal behaviors) witnessed. Ask students what new squirrel sounds and actions they ob- served during this activity. Tally the frequency of occurrence for each be- havior observed by the class. Have stu- dents identify the most common sounds and actions of squirrels. Next, ask the children to make inferences regarding the purpose of different behaviors. Introduce the term anthropomorph- ism and explain that squirrel behav- iors represent natural instincts rather than emotions and thoughts. Instruct students to refer to the "Inferences" column of their charts. Have them complete the column by making an inference regarding the purpose of each squirrel behavior observed. For exam- ple, for the "Observation" reading, "Squirrel squawks at another squirrel," the "Inference" might be "Warns other squirrel to stay away." Conclude the activity with a class discussion addressing the following questions: How many types of sounds do squirrels make? How many ways do squirrels use their tails to communi- cate? Do you see any similarities be- tween squirrel and human behaviors? Do they differ? What are the major categories or types of squirrel behav- iors? How might these different types of behaviors help squirrels to survive? Extend this activity by having stu- dents draw or act out different squirrel behaviors; their classmates can then make inferences regarding the reasons for these behaviors. For purposes of comparison, you could also conduct this activity in the same observation area during different seasons of the year. Students can then look at the yearlong data to focus on seasonal dif- ferences in the types and frequencies of squirrel behaviors. This observation exercise broadens children's perception of communica- tion in general, and of animal activity as well. If studying animal behavior used to mean a chaotic class trip to the local zoo, you'll be sure to appre- ciate the simple science found in your own schoolyard.
