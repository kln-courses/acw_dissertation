<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY SHEPHERD SLUSSER AND GAUTAMAVAJRA VAJRACARYA SOME NEPALESE STONE SCULPTURES: A REAPPRAISAL WITHIN THEIR CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT I T he Nepalese vamsavalis, or dynastic chronicles, are well-established as primary historical sources for the history of Nepal, or more specifically the Kathmandu Valley. Because of the chroniclers' transcendent interest in recording pious undertakings-a gift to a temple or the consecration of an image-the chronicles are also documents of major but neglected significance in the history of Nepalese art. That their potential in this respect is worthy of serious explora- tion, we believe this paper will convincingly demonstrate.' The chronicles comprise two groups, those compiled in the fourteenth century, and those in the nineteenth. The later chronicles largely depend on their predecessors for ancient history and are generally less reliable. They are exemplified by the well-known History of Nepal edited by Daniel Wright and first published in A.D. 1877.2 Among the older vamtavalis, the Chronicle of the Gopdla Kings, the Gopalaraj-a-vamsval,3 is of outstanding significance. Although it was not com- piled until the late fourteenth century at the court of Sthiti Malla (c. A.D. 13 82- 1395), the chron- icle attempts to treat the full range of Nepalese history. Oral tradition was unquestionably the chief source of information, supplemented no doubt-as were certainly the later chronicles--by occasional gleanings from written documents, many of which have since disappeared. While the political and cultural events, which the vadsvalis of both periods allude to, were important SThe research which made this paper possible was financed by a grant from The JDR3rd Fund, New York; to the Director, Porter A. McCray, and the Trustees of which the authors take pleasure in expressing their gratitude. 2 Third ed., Calcutta, I966 (hereinafter cited as History). Less well known is the Brahmanical rescension, of which many differing versions exist in manuscript and in published form. The best published edition is by Nayandtha Paudela and Deviprasdda Lam'lda, editors, Bhasivaymlvali [Nepali Language Chronicle], 2 parts (Kathmandu: Nepal rg.riya pustakd- laya, V.S. 2020-2023 [1963-1966] (hereinafter cited as Bhbsivamidvali). A less satisfactory, English-language version is published by Bikrama Jit Hasrat, History of Nepal as Told by Its Own and Contemporary Chronicles (Hoshiarpur (Punjab, India): V.V.Research Institute, 1970 (hereinafter cited as History), pp. 23-98. A complete description of the late chroni- cles will be found in Hasrat, History, pp.xv-xix. Some are described by Sylvain Levi, Le Nipal, 3 vols. (Paris: Ernst LUroux, 1905), vol. I, pp. 193-198, and by Luciano Petech, Mediaeval History of Nepal (Rome: Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, I958), pp. 8-Io. 3 Actually the manuscript has no name but has been so titled by Nepalese scholars because it begins with the dynasty of the Gopdla (Gupta) kings. It is also known as the Bendall Vatmidval (VBd) after its discoverer, Cecil Bendall, and as V1, V2, and V3 for the separate portions which together comprise the chronicle. The complexity of language employed by the compilers, corrupt Sanskrit and little-known classical Newari, has defied a full translation. One version of the text has been published by Naraharindtha, Himavatsamskrti (Kathmandu, V. S. 2016 [I 959]), vol. I, no. I, pp. 9-25, and another by D. R. Regmi, Medieval Nepal(Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1966), part 3, Appendix B. Both of these readings have been improved by scholars of the Sam'odhana-mandala, Kathmandu, but await further study and publication. For a description of the Gopilardja-vams.mvali see Petech, Mediaeval History of Nepal, pp. 5-7, 219-224. There is also a surviving fragment of another important early chronicle, known as the VK, described and transliterated by Petech, ibid., pp. 7-8, Appendix V, pp. 213-217, and published in Devandgari by Regmi, Medieval Nepal, part 3, Appendix C. 79</page><page sequence="2">enough to be never wholly forgotten, they were frequently misplaced chronologically, and at times hopelessly muddled to the point of being totally misleading. All the chronicles share a common fault of time exaggeration, particularly in the matter of regnal periods which are fre- quently recorded as of improbable duration. By themselves, therefore, the chronicles-early or late--are not wholly reliable. But because the assertions of the chroniclers about events even quite remote from their time can be so frequently fully corroborated by other evidence, partic- ularly contemporary epigraphs, we may in general place considerable weight on their testimony. Employed with proper caution, the chronicles are without doubt a primary source for Nepalese cultural studies. As an example of the significance of the chronicles in the study of Nepalese art we shall closely examine a typical passage from the Gop larafa-vamdvali which treats of the reigns of three Gupta rulers, Jivagupta, Visnugupta, and Bhimigupta.4 Although the Guptas are historically documented figures of the Kathmandu Valley in the sixth and early seventh century A.D., the existence of one Jivaguptas is not supported by the available epigraphic evidence. It seems prob- able that this exotic name is the chroniclers' mistake for Jisnugupta, the father of Visnugupta, for both of whom the historic validity is attested by ample documentary evidence. Bh?imigupta is apparently the chroniclers' version of Bhama- or Bhaumagupta, another well-documented histor- ical figure. As is typical of the chronicles, Bhaumagupta is chronologically misplaced, however, for he was in point of fact ancestral to Jisnu and Visnu. II Before examining the selected passage of the Gop laraPa-vaPmival with reference to Nepalese art, it will be necessary to digress briefly to clarify the important but little known role of the Guptas in Nepalese political and cultural history. On the testimony of contemporary stone inscriptions it is clear that the Gupta family contested the rule of the Licchavi dynasty for some I3 5 years. This was between A.D. 5 o6 and 641, thereby covering more than a fifth of the period of Licchavi rule (circa A.D. 300 to 85o). How the Valley Guptas were related, if at all, to the well-known Gupta line of India is not clear. The Valley Guptas themselves merely claimed descent from the lunar dynasty6 (the Licchavis, solar) and were of the Abhira (Gomi, Gomin) cowherd caste,7 a relation- 4 Gopilardja-vamiduvali, fols. 21ib-zz22 b. s Erroneously read as givagupta by Regmi, Medieval Nepal, part 3, Appendix B, p.

The epoch year of the former is A.D. 78 and of the latter 576, dates to which the A.D. conversions in this paper conform.

But they soon emerged as powerful individuals who, while in name sharing the rule with the Licchavis, in fact wielded the real power. In three instances the Guptas appear for a time to have pushed aside the Licchavis altogether and ruled alone.9 The first to do so was Bhiimigupta--or as he is known in the inscriptions, Bhiima- or Bhaumagupta. His name first appears in A.D. 540 inscribed on a Sivalifiga consecrated by his mother in the memory of her deceased husband, Anuparama.io A few years later, in A.D. 5 57, we find Bhaumagupta simultaneously enjoying two of the highest governmental offices, Aide-de-Camp (mahdpratihdra) and Inspector General of Police (mahisarv- vada.danayaka). Bhaumagupta's name appears regularly thereafter in the inscriptions of Gana- deva, A.D. 56o to 567, under whom he continued to hold these same high offices.,2 That he ac- tually at length emerged a king is suggested by an inscription which unequivocally refers to him with royal title, "paramadaivatasri Bhaumagupta,"13 by two posthumous ones which name him as a former king,1 and by the Gopjlaraja-vatmn vliawhich also refers to him as a king.is Moreover, the Gop laraa-vamSavali, followed by the later chronicles, specifically records an interim Gopila (Gupta) period between the temporary overthrow of the solar dynasty and its subsequent resti- tution.16 Bhaumagupta may have ruled some part of the as yet undocumented near quarter- century between Ganadeva's last record, A.D. D 67, and the first of Sivadeva I, A.D. 90.x7 In the 8 Ibid., p. 6. 9 Jagadi'acandra Regmi, Licchavi-samskrti [Licchavi Culture] (Kathmandu: Ratna pustaka bhand&lt;ra, V.S.2026 [i969]), pp. 14,16-i9, 27-28 and in an abridged English translation which because of many errors must be used with caution, "The Gupta Kings of Nepal," Regmi Research Series (Kathmandu, July 1970), vol. 2, no.7, pp. 157, 159-I6o, I64-I65, considers there were only two occasions, Bhauma (= Bhfima) and Jisnu, but to these it seems Visnugupta (vide post) must also be added. According to a recent postulate of Baburdma Acdrya, "Nepdlamd jala'ayana nrdyagna-mfrtiko sthdpand [The Establishing of Jala'ayana Ndrdyana Images in Nepal]," Nepal (Kathmandu, V. S. 2027 Kdrttika [October I970] (hereinafter cited as "Jala'ayana Nri?yana," Nepali 45)), no. 45, pp. i0o-I , Bh~imagupta and Bhaumagupta are two per- sons, father and son. Thus, if so, there would be still another occasion. Although this view is not impossible, it is not supported by the available evidence and strong counter-arguments may be adduced against it. 10 Gnoli, Inscr. 16, p. 23, Samvat 462 [A.D. 540]. 2 Rdmaji Tevdri and others, "Pharpiiko abhilekha [An Inscription from Pharpiig]," Abhilekha-sangraha (Kathmandu, V.

Fortunately for the history of Nepalese art, the story of the Valley Guptas did not end with the illustrious Bhaumagupta, but continued with his descendants, Jisnu and Visnu. For after a hiatus during Am~uvarman's rule, c.A.D. 60o5-62i, when no Gupta or Gomin name is recorded, suddenly Bhaumagupta's grandson,18 Jisnugupta, emerges as a forceful personality. At first he is a joint ruler with the Licchavi king, Dhruvadeva, then with the latter's successor, Bhimarjuna- deva. Jisnugupta was clearly a strong personality. He may well have played a key role in altering the rightful order of Licchavi succession,* and, like his grandfather, apparently also ruled alone for a time. There are two inscriptions which were issued naming him as the sole ruler,20 another in which he is named as king, 2 and he issued a coin in his own right.22 His son, Visnugupta, must also have thrown off the Licchavi monarch for a brief spell at least and assumed complete power. This is attested by an edict issued from Kaildsakita alone, the Gupta seat of authority, an inscription in which the ruler's name is omitted but the witness is Visnugupta's son and Crown Prince, Sridharagupta.23 The Gopalaraja-vamiaval, too, accords Visnugupta royal status, as do the later chronicles.24 Even though the Licchavi kings' names, adorned with all the customary honorific titles, are circumspectly cited first in the inscriptions, and though they claimed the traditional royal palace of M~inagrha as their residence, there is no question that they were essentially figureheads and that it was the Guptas who actually exercised the power in the period of joint rule. As an example, while an inscription at Thinkot village purports to be jointly that of BhimSirjunadeva and Jisnugupta, it is clearly only Jisnugupta who speaks.2s For it was in memory of a Gupta ancestor's warm association with a particular village-certainly no concern of the Licchavi Bhimdrjunadeva-- that Jisnugupta abolished one of the village taxes to reestablish the former Gupta tie. In another inscription, too, issued jointly with Dhruvadeva, the words "my grandfather King Bhfima- gupta,"26 clearly reveal that it is in fact only Jisnugupta who speaks. More importantly, from Jisnugupta's time it was their sons, not the Licchavis', who were boldly named to the succession as Crown Prince (yuvaraja). Jisnugupta's son, Visnu, succeeded his father as joint ruler with 1s Or in accordance with the postulate of AcIrya, "Jalagayana Nirdyana," Nepai 45, pp. 10o-Ii, 19, son or nephew. 19 Regmi, Licchavi-samskrti, p. 21. 20 Gnoli, Inscr. 59, p. 79 (edited by Dhanavajra Vajrdcarya, "Licchavikdlamd dhdrmika safigha [Religious Congregations of the Licchavi Period]," Pfarimad (V.

This promise apparently went unfulfilled, however, for after Visnugupta's last inscription, jointly with Bhimirjunadeva, in A.D. 641,27 the Guptas disappear from Valley history. By A.D. 643 28s a Licchavi king, Narendradeva, is ruling alone and unencumbered and has abandoned the MinagTha palace for Kailisakita, the prestigious residence of Am~uvarman, which at his death had been arrogated by the Guptas. The Guptas were a presence not only in the political but also in the cultural life of Nepal. This was clearly a family tradition in keeping with the high socio-economic and prolonged political status they enjoyed. It is Jisnugupta's ancestor Minagupta Gomin's meritorious act of constructing a pond for a village which in part concerns his descendant's Thinkot edict mentioned above.-9 It may be that Jisnugupta's great grandfather, Anuparama, is the same Anuparama responsible for the verses and the hauntingly lovely Garuda image on the well-known pillar at H.digid. o The constant endeavour of the Guptas to honor their gods and to pursue their personal dharma is made abundantly clear by both epigraphic and literary evidence. They were unquestion- ably among the most munificent of religious patrons and have indelibly marked the art of their country with their pious undertakings. The period of Gupta influence in Valley affairs appears to have corresponded with that of the growing popularity of Visnuism. Although the Guptas avowed their Saiva faith among their chosen royal titles, "bhagavat-Paupati-bha.t.traka-pdddnugrhita.' ' (favored by the feet of Lord Giva Padupati), they were no less devoted Vaisnavas.31 Bhaumagupta was responsible for erecting an image of Visnu in his Variha avatdira, according to the Gopdlaraja-vamidvali, and a Licchavi- period inscription names him as the benefactor of the Nardyana of Nupunnadratiga.32 Further, after his donations had been annulled by Licchavi kings, it was his descendant, Jisnugupta, who restored the ancestral benefices and added others of his own.33 Although we have no records of Jisnugupta having erected a particular Visnu image, as we have for his grandfather and for his son, by this act it is obvious that he was also warmly disposed toward Visnuism. Moreover, his attitude respecting Visnu is especially clearly attested in his inscription at Thinkot, where the invocational verses are in honor of Jalagayana Narayana.34 With tender familiarity the divine Visnu is depicted lolling on his snake couch, his ocean-wet body thrilling to the touch of Laksmi's breasts.

III More than any other member of his family, however, it was Visnugupta who was especially devoted to Vis.nu,3s and, in the name of this divinity, left a major legacy of art monuments which we are about to examine. Let us, therefore, return to the selected passage of the Goplaraya- vamdvalt which treats of the reigns of the Gupta kings. Their era is summarized thus: "King Bhimadeva [Bhim~irjunadeva?] reigned 14 years. After that the Gopdla [Gupta] dynasty con- quered the solar dynasty and reigned powerfully again. King Jivagupta reigned 74 years. He offered Lord Visnu of Nandala [H.digdii village].., a golden chain for his beautification and donated a pilgrim's shelter, many fields, a garden, and a building [for his support]. King Visnu- gupta reigned 71 years. At Pa'upati on the eastern bank of the Vdgvati he established a large stone image of Lord Visnu of the size of his own body, together with two other images the size of his two sons on either side of it. Then, again, near the northern mountain, in the middle of the place named Narasimha, he built a huge stone image of Jalasayana Visnu, together with an exceedingly beautiful dwelling-place. He established an image of Visnu in copper or stone in various places on every eleventh day of the lunar fortnight. He also built a fountain called Parameivara-prarnli. At the same place he established a stone image of catu[r]mfrti Lord Visnu. King Bhamigupta reigned 45 years. He introduced in Nepal the use of a script known as Goli [round] and established Dharanivariha Visnu. These three Gopdla kings reigned. Then the solar dynasty reigned again powerfully."36 Setting aside the deeds of Jivagupta, whose identification is uncertain, we shall examine only those credited to the historically established figures, Visnugupta and his great grandfather, Bhau- magupta. Let us begin with the chroniclers' assertion that Visnugupta "built a huge stone image of Jala'ayana Visnu." In this they are proven to be quite correct for Visnugupta's donation is fully confirmed by contemporary epigraphic evidence.37 Moreover, the image is one of the most as Dhanavajra VajricHrya, "Biidhanilakantha-nardyanamiirtiko nirm.nkgla [The Date of the Btidhdnilakantha Nirdyana Image]," Gorkhbpatra (Kathmandu, Mdgha 4, V.S.2026 [17 January 1970]) (hereinafter cited as "Biidhanilakantha," Gorkhipatra (17 January 1970)), pp. 5,8. 36 Gopalardja-rvamidvali, fols. 21 i b-22 b.

One of the pertinent con- temporary inscriptions, a skillfully engraved and decorated stone stele (Figure 3), still stands in Yahigal-hiti, an ancient fountain in southern Kathmandu, the former Licchavi town, Daksina- koligrima. It is a joint edict of Bhimdrjunadeva and Visnugupta dated in the Ambuvarman Era 64 [A. D. 640]3 and opening with an invocation to Anantasayana Ndrdya.a. Its purpose is to inform the citizens of Daksinakoligrdma that in return for royal satisfaction with their part in having dragged a large stone suitable for making a Jalasayana image of Lord Visnu, they shall hence- forth, with specified exceptions, be permitted to wear all kinds of ornaments. The other relevant inscription stands near the ancient Bhrfigdresvara lifiga at Sundgiithi village, several miles south of Kathmandu.40 Issued by the same rulers in the following year, it too opens with an invocation to Jala'ayana Ndrdyana.41 In this instance, to express royal thanks for the special efforts the Bhrfigaragrama palcdli (a regional administrative unit) had expended in dragging the needed stone for a Jaladayana image, the people are relieved of further forced labor together with an onerous social regulation to which they previously had been subject. In addition to thepdclils of Daksinakoligrdma and Bhtnig-ragrama, many otherpdicliis no doubt contributed their part in wrestling the huge stone across the Valley floor, but of these we have no record. It was clearly a special task above and beyond those normally expected of thepdicdis and the suc- cessful completion of it was rewarded in special ways by the gratified rulers. There is no question that the Bidh~inilakantha image must be attributed specifically to Visnu- gupta, rather than to the Licchavi king, Bhimarjunadeva42 in whose name the inscriptions were also issued. This is not only because of the testimony of the Gopalaraja-vali , which is not to be lightly dismissed, but because the image was made during the period of Gupta ascendancy over the Licchavi kings. We have already observed that while edicts were formally couched in the joint Licchavi-Gupta names, the orders unquestionably emanated from the Gupta side. The enormous Visnu Anantadyin in particular, therefore, was a decisive expression of political power, for only someone of Visnugupta's obvious status could have mobilized the Valley pdgcdlis and exacted from them a corvee which was clearly in excess of normal royal expectations. Of this Visnugupta was also quite aware, hence the special benefices in return for special services rendered. Actually, neither of the above mentioned inscriptions identifies the destination of the stone which was to become the Jala6ayana image. Again it is the Gopalaraya-vaja-vali, in conjunction with a third contemporary inscription, which supplies the answer. Chronicle and inscription 38 There are several names by which the manifestation of Ndrdyana lying on the water on the Cosmic Serpent is known. The serpent, and the water itself, symbolizes the cosmic ocean, as does also ViS.u whom serpent and water support. The ser- pent's name is Ananta (endless) or gea (remainder, rest). The name Seqa, The Remainder, refers to the abyssal waters which did not become manifest as other aspects of the evolved universe and therefore remained embodied in the serpent. Sayana and -idyin are Sanskrit terms which denote recumbent, andjala is a Sanskrit name for water. These words may be combined in several ways the most common of which are Jala'ayana Ndrdyana, Sepasayana Ndrdyana, and Vi.nu Anan- tas'yin. In essence all mean the same, "Visnu recumbent on the endless serpent on the water." 39 Gnoli, Inscr.6x, pp.8x1-82 (edited by D.Vajrdicrya, "Licchavikdlako nyiyavyavasthdko eka jhalaka," Parnimd 16, pp. 357-358). o40 Gnoli, Inscr. 62, pp. 83-84 (edited by D.Vajriccirya, ibid., pp. 358-359). 41 As established by D.

The chronicle states that Visnugupta established the image "near the northern mountain, in the middle of the place named Narasimha." That Nara- simha was the Licchavi name of Badhinilakantha is established by a joint edict of Sivadeva and Am~uvarman, located within the sacred compound not far from the image, which is addressed to the citizens of two villages, one of which is Narasimha.,4 The Narasimha tirtha, or place of holy pilgrimage, was well known to the compilers of the Himavatkhanda, the Himalayan section of the Skandapurdna. They describe it as a river confluence on the slopes of the Satarudra, the Mountain of a Hundred Sivas (now generally called Sivapuri), at whose foot Bidh~inilakantha lies.44* More- over, the ancient tirtha may still be identified, for a half-hour's climb up the steep slopes behind Bfdhlinilakantha brings one to a veti, the confluence of two streams, to which the old name, modified as Narasimha Ghdt, still tenaciously clings. There are no images to be seen at the sacred confluence, for these were submerged at the beginning of the century when the streams were dammed as a water reservoir, the Mohan Pokhari. The old name, too, Narasimha tirtha, was largely abandoned then in favor of the reservoir's name and is today scarcely known, not even by the cottagers who dwell but minutes away.4s Occasional people still worship at the traditional site, nonetheless, among whom are the priests of the Ndrdyana image at Budhanilakantha. Indeed, it is to them and their memory of the traditional name, Narasimha, that we owe the identification of the ancient site. The huge stone needed for the monumental Jala'ayana Ndrdyana image probably came from Kotkhd, a site whose precise location awaits determination, but which lay in the southwestern part of the Valley,46 or more likely just outside over the rim. We know that in the late Malla period Kotkha stone was prized for the making of images. Jitdmitra Malla of Bhaktapur had a Kiliya- damana carved from it,47 apparently now lost. He also boasted that whereas former Bhaktapur kings had found it difficult to get even a single Kotkh! stone, he alone, because of his rapport with the Pitan king, had been able to secure it for various undertakings within the Taleju temple compound.*48 The Pdtan kingdom included the southwestern part of the Valley (in which Bhrfi- gdre'vara lies) and extended a few miles south and west over the rim. Hence we can conclude that this particular fine-grained stone came from this region. The common, friable, and often mica- ceous stones of the Valley were impractical for the making of large images, and certainly for one of the size and importance of the BidhInilakantha Ndrayana. In the fourteenth century, the noble 43 Gnoli, Inscr.27, p. 35; D.Vajricarya, "BSdhdnilakantha," Gorkhbpatra (17 January 1970), p. 5. *44 Naraharindtha and others, editors, Himavatkhanda (Benares: Yogapracdrini, V.S.-2013 [1956] (hereinafter cited as Hima- vatkhanda)), ch.

I9). 46 D.Vajricirya, "BiSdhdnilakantha," Gorkhipatra (17 January I970), p. 5. Even now there is a village of similar name, Kodku, just inside the Valley's southern rim, near Lele, but to our knowledge there is no quarry there. Geological in- vestigations could no doubt quite easily determine the site where the stone originates. 47 Bholindtha Paudela and Dhanavajra Vajrdcarya, "Bhaktapurakd dui aprakdtita 'ildlekhako prakiga [Two Hitherto Un- published Bhaktapur Stone Inscriptions]," Itihbasa-samlodhana (V.

Perhaps Narasimhasthina was considered an especially appropriate site because of its ancient association with Visnu near the Narasimha tirtha.so It was certainly not because the site was Bhumbhukkiki, the locale of an earlier Jala'ayana image.s, Scholars have been led astray in this because the modern Newari name of the site, Bhuijasi, is suggestive of the ancient name.s2 But Bhuijasi actually derives from another Newari name, Bhoyujalasena, meaning clear water, as the springs were known in the late Malla period.s Perhaps Visnugupta had some special person- al association with this region, one of the most populous and important in the Licchavi realm. It may also have been merely because of the limpid springs, a necessary adjunct for a representation of Visnu ensconced on the endless serpent in the cosmic ocean. But there were other springs, equally limpid, to be found at Goddvari and at Pharpifig, both of which lie much closer to the presumed quarry site, and the latter of which did become an important Visnu shrine, apparently in the post-Licchavi or early Malla period. From the very beginning, when the Jala6ayana image was given form, sometime just after A.D. 641, and lay in its "exceedingly beautiful dwelling-place," it must have attracted devotees from far and wide. Many would have eagerly hastened to worship the marvel they had helped inch across the Valley while it was still mutely imprisoned within the stone. Although the dwel- ling-place is now compromised by mundane structures, colored tile, and cement, the flow of devotees and admirers seems never to have ceased.s4 Today the Bildhainlakantha sculpture is the object of profound veneration by all Nepalesess and enjoys daily worship by numerous devotees and by Brahman priests. The latter-some charged with rites at the head, others restricted, as are all devotees, to the feet-sing hymns of praise, bathe, feed, fan, cense, and adorn the image.

There are varying accounts, some saying that the image was accidentally discovered by farmers, others that Jalagayana Ndriyana appeared to a king (of variable name) in a dream to whom he revealed his buried location and commanded to be disinterred and worshipped again (Wright, History, 3rd ed., P 76; Bhcxvramljvali, part I, pp. 57-58, 81; "R-jabhogam-il-," Ancient Nepal8, p. 19). 55ss Excepting members of the royal family who abide by N-r-yasa's order that on pain of death they may not visit him at Bfdh-nilakap.tha (Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 146; Hasrat, History, p.75; BhdsdvamijSvalf, part 2, p.87). The chronicles date the event to the reign of Pratipa Malla. It may well reflect a more ancient tradition, as Acarya, "Jala.ayana Ndrdya.a," Neplji45, P. 24, also suggests, in which beginning with Vi .ugupta's successor, Narendradeva, the Licchavi kings refused to pay homage to the Gupta donation. Ackrya traces it to a difference of faith but this would be untenable since both dy- nasties were equally devoted to Vig.u and to Siva. It is possible, however, that jealousy did keep the Licchavis away and that the proscription against royalty visiting the prodigious BaihWnilaka.tha image actually dates from the seventh, rather than the seventeenth, century. 87</page><page sequence="10">pile ialagramas, black fossil ammonites symbolic of Visnu, around his head, and conclude the daily worship by covering his brow with a cloth. This is said to check the perspiration induced by the ardent mountain sun, fully exposed to which Visnu and Ananta lie. The image is also the ob- ject of special worship in the spring, during intercalary months, and on every ekddali, the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight. There are two special Visnu "elevenths," Haridayani, in early summer when Visnu withdraws to slumber on the compliant Ananta, and Haribodhini, when he awakens in the fall. The latter, as an occasion of special joy, attracts large throngs of devotees. It is no doubt the Haribodhini ekdadi celebration to which a seventh-century Licchavi inscription refers.s6 The Badhlnilakan.tha Jalagayana Nairayana is worshipped equally by Hindus and Buddhists. Moreover, although the image is eminently Vaisnava, because it is believed to contain the essence of both Brahmd and Siva, a part of the daily worship is devoted to the deity in his Saiva aspect. This is known as Rudrip-ji (worship according to the cult of Rudra, a name of Siva), in which a miniature water vessel (jalahari) is placed on the crown and from which drip the five precious nectars to the accompaniment of hymns in praise of Siva (Figure 2). Some people, too, identify the symbolic lotus bud, an attribute of Visnu and displayed by this image in the lower right hand, as the vibhbti, or ball of ashes, which the yogis carry. Since Siva is the archetypal yogi, the symbol thus interpreted reinforces the Saiva aspect of the image and many therefore worship it as Sfikara- Nr~iyan.a, or Harihara, a syncretic half-Siva, halfVisnu.s7 According to our research the image is not worshipped as Nilakantha Loke'vara,s8 despite the similarity of epithets. Newar Buddhists clearly refer to the image as "Bhuijasi Ndrdyana-dyo," the god Ndriya.a of Bhuijasi, and worship it as such. Occasional Tibetans from the hills and Newar Buddhist priests from the towns wor- ship the image as Buddha, but this is partly from ignorance and partly in keeping with the belief that Buddha, too, was an incarnation ofVisnu. The appellation "Nilakantha," or Blue-throat, properly an epithet of Siva, applied to Visnu has not been satisfactorily explained.s0 Priests in charge of the image claim that it derives from their own ancestor, Nilakantha, a particularly wise and famous priest. Biburdma Aclirya cites a similar derivation, tracing it to certain late eighteenth- early nineteenth-century sannydsis, renow- ned for their cleverness, who--as sannydsis still do-resided at the holy site.60 This derivation is apocryphal, however, for at least by the mid-seventeenth century it was already known as Nilakantha tirtha.6s We shall explore this problem more fully further on. The "Bf.dhd," is not Buddha62 but derives from bf.dho, and ultimately qrddha, Nepali and Sanskrit words meaning old, s6 Rdmaji Tevdri and others, "Anantalifigeivarako gildlekha [A Stone Inscription from Anantalifige'vara]," Abbilekha- satfigraha (V.

That Bfidhdnilakantha is meant, rather than the Himalayan Nilakantha tirtha at Gosdinkurnda, seems clear by the inclusion of all three of the Nilakanthas: the Himalayan Nilakantha by what we believe to be one of its many alternate names, Golahitidaha; Bidhdnilakantha simply as Nilakantha; and the Bdldju tirtha, Bdlanilakantha. 62 A common belief which also seems even to have misled Pal, Vaigsoava Iconology, p. 17. 88</page><page sequence="11">major, or large. It serves to distinguish the larger, more famous image from another Jaladayana NrIyana installed in a pool at Biliju, on the northwestern outskirts of Kathmandu (Figures 4, 5). This is the Child, or Little Nilakantha, Bilanilakantha. There are Indian parallels to such a distinc- tion between two similarly named images.63 IV Returning again to our selected passage of the Gopilara#a-va?mldvali, we may recall that in addition to Visnugupta's donation of the Jalasayana Ndrdyaga image of Narasimha-sthIna, it enumerates still others of his deeds. If, as they say, he established an image in copper or stone on every eki-daii, and if any have survived, we are unable to identify them. "He also built a fountain called Parames- vara-pranil. At the same place he established a stone image of catu[r]mirti Lord Visnu." This entry, just as that for the B-idhin1lakantha image, also appears to be quite correct for both the fountain and the image may now be identified. Both are at Baldju: the fountain, enlarged in the eighteenth century64 to twenty-two spouts, the famous Bdisdhrdi; and the image, the nearby "Jaladayana Ndrdyana," or Bdlanilakantha. The image at Baliju has long been wrongly accepted as a copy of the Bfidh1inlakantha image, commissioned by Pratapa Malla, ruler of the Kingdom of Kathmandu A.D. 1641-1674.65 Before demonstrating both the validity of the chronicle and the rightful place of the B5lanilakantha image it will be pertinent, therefore, to examine this false premise. There is no documentation to support an assignment of the image to the seventeenth century or to Pratdpa Malla in particular, not even an oral tradition,66 and the image flatly contradicts it on stylistic grounds. The gross error in dating is difficult to explain--and even more so a century of its blind acceptance. In part the error seems to have arisen out of confusion with another Jalasayana image, which was a concern of PratSipa Malla, and which we shall examine further along. Apart from the stylistic and documen- tary considerations which preclude the seventeenth century date, a study of the image in historical 63 Dhurigela, "Bfadhdnilakantha," Maryddd I, 3, p.46. 64 Although unsubstantiated by epigraphic evidence, the chronicles assign the building of twenty-one spouts to Jayaprak'sa Malla, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Kathmandu, A.D. 1736-1768 (Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 153; Hasrat, History, p.89). To these, according to oral tradition, King Rana Bahddura Saha (A.D.1777-1799) added one more, making the Twenty-two Spouts. This must have been toward the end of his reign or in the years between his abdication and death in A.D. 1805, for at the time of Kirkpatrick's mission to Nepal in 1793 there were still only twenty-one spouts (Colonel Kirkpatrick, An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul (London: William Miller, 18 11 (hereinafter cited as Account)), pp. 141 to 142. 6s We have been unable to trace the source of the original mistake. Kirkpatrick (Account, p. 142), one of the earliest Western observers, did not so label it, merely stating that both Baghd and Bila are "representations, on a small scale, of the Himma- leh Neel-khent." But by 188o, at least, the false attribution was fixed when Henry Ambrose Oldfield wrote, "about one hundred and fifty years ago the Niwars built the Bala Nil Khent at Balaji in imitation of the other" (Sketches from Nipal (London: W.H.Allen, i880), vol. 2, p. 3 39). LUvi, too, labelled the Bdliju image "de facture toute moderne" and con- sidered the "true" Jalagayana to be at Baihdiilakan.tha (Le Nipal, vol.2, p.353). Percy Brown followed suite, descri- bing the image as "nearly two hundred years" old and "built subsequently to the larger representation" (Picturesque Nepal (London: Adam and Charles Black, 1912z), pp. I182, 184). Perceval Landon repeated the story again, calling the BIliju image a "smaller reproduction of the [Bidhd] Nilakantha figure" (Nepal (London: Constable and Co., I928), vol. I, pp. 227-228). Modern scholars have uncritically accepted the early ascription and have further compounded the error by gratuitously assigning the image to Pratipa Malla, David L. Snellgrove, "Shrines and Temples of Nepal," Arts Asiatiques (Paris, I1961), vol. 8, no. 2, p. I 12; Ernst and Rose Leonore Waldschmidt, Nepal Art Treasuresfrom the Himalayas (Calcutta: Oxford and IBH Publishing Company, 1969), Fig. 8, p. 25; Pal, Vai.snava Iconology, pp.4, 79-80, 171, n.30. Pal, at least, clearly sensed the image to be earlier and accepted it as a seventeenth-century copy with obvious hesitation. 66 The attribution to Prat~ipa Malla, although fully absorbed in the tourist circuit and accepted by foreigners and Western- educated Nepalese, is essentially a literary one and quite unfamiliar to the unsophisticated sector of the Nepalese public. 89</page><page sequence="12">perspective alone proves it not to be a donation of Pratapa Malla. Pratapa Malla was one of the outstanding Malla kings and certainly foremost in pious donations of every kind. His hand almost alone shaped the Kathmandu Darbdr Square and his temples, monasteries, dharmaidlds, fountains, columns, sculptures, and inscriptions spread throughout his own kingdom and occasionally beyond. Pratipa Malla did not count modesty among his virtues. He took care to publicize his deeds and achievements, real and imaginary, with extensive documentation and often in his own verse of which he boasted himself the laureate (kavindra). Moreover, he lived in an age when diaries (.thydsaphus, literally, folded books) were kept into which were entered the daily minutiae of Valley life. It is unthinkable, therefore, that a king who himself left a record in stone and copper of almost every deed should have neglected to claim such a prodigious image, or that at least others should not have mentioned his association with it. Even the chronicles which devote several pages to his life and deeds are silent on the issue. So also is D. R. Regmi in his thorough summary of the ruler's activities.67 Moreover, quite apart from the evidence of the Gopilaraja-vamidval, we are able independently to establish a pre-seventeenth century date for the image. It is clearly mentioned in the Nepdla- mdhdtmya, a Nepalese addenda to the Skaydapurdna which escapes positive dating but certainly long predates the seventeenth century.68 In the tirthaydtrivarnand, a guide to places of pilgrimage in the Valley, the Nepila-mdhitmya recommends: "Go to the Western NrSiyana... then to Bud- dhasthana... then to the Visnumati. Bathe and make oblations to the manes, then go to Lunthi- ke'a where there is Lord Hari. Having seen NSiryaga recumbent on Ananta, then go north, remembering Visnu. At the foot of the mountain there is Ndriyana reclining within the serpent's hoods, by the seeing of whom one's sins are cleansed. Return south to Jayavligisvari Siva, worship her ... and, remembering Visnu, go to Pagupati."69 The passage refers to two Visnu images, each recumbent on a serpent, Lord Hari at Lunthi- kega and, further north at the foot of the mountain, another. That they are the two Nilakanthas, Bdla and Bfidhd, there is no question. The recommended tirtha is a ksetrapradaksi -d, a clockwise geographic progression around the Valley and beyond.70 It begins and ends at Pagupatinitha, with the above tirthas representing the closing ones. The Western Ndrayana [Icafigu], Buddhas- thnha [Svayambhinitha], the Visnumati, and "Lunthike6a where there is Lord Hari [Bdldju]," lie within the same radius. The second Ndrdyana, "north at the foot of the mountain," corresponds to the location of Baidh~inilakantha relative to Bdldju, and due south of which, in Deupitan, lie the two final tirthas, Jayavigisvari and Padupatinitha. We may be certain that Lunthikega is Biliju7i for it is one of several similar deformations of Hlutikega, Siva of the Fountain, from hluti (Newari, fountain) and Ia, the supreme deity (Siva). A similar deformation is Lutikot, the Fort of Luti, derived from a fortlet established near the tirtha in the eighteenth century and popular then as the name for Biliju among Nepali speakers. With the decay of the fort in the 67 Medieval Nepal, part 2, pp. 68-82. 68 Concerning the Nepdla-mjhitmya see LUvi, Le Nipal, vol.

It also occasionally unaccountably backtracks counter to the prescribed pradakasind. 7t L~vi, Le Ndpal, vol. I, pp. 390-391 erred in identifying Lunthikega tirtha as Bfildhanilakantha, as did Dhufigela, "Bfidhin- Ilakagtha," Maryddd I, 3, PP-43-44- 90</page><page sequence="13">nineteenth century, the name Lutikot, too, fell into disuse and was superceded in popularity among Nepali speakers by Biliji, or Bdl.ju, the Honorable Little One, as the Niriyana image at the tirtha is familiarly known. In the Svayambhfi-purdna, an undateable work but anterior to the seventeenth century,72 the tirtha is designated simply as Hluti, and by that name, or Luthi, it survives still as the preferred name for Bdlju among the Newar community. Moreover, in the paacin~ga, or yearly almanac, the annual Caitra full-moon celebration at BSiliju even now is identi- fied simply as Hluti-punhi, the Hluti Full Moon. To assist the restoration of the magnificent Biilju sculpture to its rightful chronological place, which we believe to be the mid-seventh century A.D. as the chronicle tells us, it will be necessary first to consider the Parameivara-pran~li. For this was the fountain Visnugupta is said to have built and the place he chose to establish another image of Visnu. We may be certain that Paramesvara-pranili is the site of the present Twenty-two Spout Fountain at Biliju. For although like Hlutike'a, too, the name Parameivara has disappeared, it was still current in the early eigh- teenth century prior to the installation of the extraordinary number of spouts which earned the fountain a new name, Biisdhiri (Twenty-two Spouts). Our evidence is provided by a thydsaphu entry which records King Bhiskara Malla's pilgrimage to the famous tirtha of Gosainkupda, the Pool of Lord Siva.73 Also known by many other names among which are the Newari ones, G Sivaluti, Siluti, or Silu, the Fountain of Giva, the tirtha lies in the first high mountain range north of the Valley. On a Saturday night in October A.D. 17 14 the king "started for Siruthi [Siluti]. He halted at Parameivara fountain. After three days... he went to Dharmithari."74 That the Parame'vara fountain refers to Bliju is certain. Yogis who make the annual pilgrimage to Gosiinkunda still follow this particular route. They, too, halt at Bildju, then proceed to the village of Dharmithari or, as it is now called, Dharamthali or Dharmasthali. There they spend the night before proceeding for the first pass out of the Kathmandu Valley and on into the mountains. Parameivara-pran.li, the Fountain of the Supreme Deity (Siva), is essentially the Sanskrit equivalent of Hlutike'a (Siva of the Fountain), which, as we have said, drifted to Lunthike'a, Lutikot, Luntike'vara, Luti, Luthi, Lhuti, or simply Hluti, by one name or another of which the tirtha became familiarly known. Twenty years ago when the Baisdhird was renovated, several ancient spouts were unco- vered behind the present fountain and over which a cemented promenade now passes., We ourselves found not far away an ancient dhdrd cover, a damaged makara-like creature with the flamboyant floral-scroll tail, hallmark of Gupta and Licchavi art alike. This ancient piece has now been repositioned over the central spout of the modern fountain. Now let us consider the stone "catu[r]mfrti Lord Visnu" which the chronicle asserts Visnu- gupta established at ParameZvara-pranili. There are a number of images near the fountain, a popular mother goddess, or ajimi, some less well-known sculptures, and the recumbent Visnu image. But the latter seems to be a Jaladayana Niriyana, rather than the Caturmarti Visnu men- 72 Haraprasid Sdstri, editor, The Vrihat Svayambh# Purdnam Containing the Traditions of the Svayambhb Kshetra in Nepal (Cal- cutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1894), p. 284.

Actually, from the faulty Sanskrit of the Gopalaraja-vama-vali text we are not certain whether the entry "catum#rti" means a Caturmjrti Visnu or "four images of Visnu." The versions of the reigns of the three Gupta kings given in some of the nineteenth century chronicles, although not without later interpolations, closely compare with the account in the Goplaraja-vamSavali. This or a companion early chronicle must have been the later writers' model. It is perhaps significant, then, that the later editions do not use the term caturmfrti with reference to this donation of Visnugupta, but say rather that he "established four Jalagayana images."76 Although not with reference to the donations ofVisnugupta, other late chronicles, too, mention four Jala'ayana images in the Valley.77 The anomaly of the name "caturmfrti," however, it will be convenient to disregard for awhile. Further, we have no epigraphic support to the chronicle's assertion that an image of Visnu was established at Parameivara-pran.il by Visnugupta.78 The stylistic evidence of the recumbent Visnu, however, speaks so overwhelmingly in favor ofVisnugupta's time79 that there seems little reason to deny it to him. This is particularly so since the Gop laraja-vamdvali says that he establi- shed a Visnu image just here, and since in the instance of the corresponding B.dhanilakantha ima- ge the epigraphy resoundingly proved the chronicle to be correct. Moreover, as we shall see, the chronicle is equally correct about another important donation which it assigns to Visnugupta (Figure 19). A priestly oral tradition, it should be noted, assigns the image to "Narendradeva," meaning in effect "a remote king." The late chronicles suggest Sivadeva I (documents from A. D. 590-604) by the entry "Viswadeva [= Sivadeva] ... made a large stone image of Vishnu on the northern side of the Bagmati and Vishnumati."80 V It is perhaps little wonder that the Bdldju image has for so long been considered a copy of the larger, Bfidhanilakantha image. For stylistically the two are very close indeed. As Pratapaditya Pal judiciously observed, and this despite the shackles of our universal brain-washing respecting Balanilakantha, "the amazing closeness in style demonstrates once again the difficulty of dating Nepali sculptures with any absoluteness."81 The "amazing closeness," however, rather than deriving from the skill of seventeenth-century hands, almost certainly may be traced to the creative 76 "RIjabhogam~ll," Ancient Nepal 8, p. 19. 77 Bdlacandra $armd, editor, "Kdthmd.ndu-upatyakdko eka rdjavamb'val [A Royal Chronicle from the Kathmandu Valley]," part I, Ancient Nepal (July 1968), no.4, p. 6; Hasrat, History, p. 28. 78 Unwittingly destroyed in the nineteenth century, perhaps. According to one of Visnu's priests, an inscription which stood nearby and which was believed to pertain to the image was ruthlessly smashed in the course of a violent priestly quarrel over the rights to worship the image, and in which at last the Nepalese king had to intervene. We have been unable to trace any remains of the inscription, for even a fragment, if written in Gupta characters, would have significant bearing on the question of dating the image. 79 The history of our research on the Bdldju image is illuminating in this respect. One partner quite independently had decided the early date of the image on appearance only, stating in the second draft of the paper "on stylistic grounds alone the image must be assigned to the Licchavi period. But we cannot say whether before or after Vin.ugupta's Biidh&lt;nilakantha dona- tion." Meanwhile, the other partner had established the vital link of the old names for Bdldju and the fountain which, when we brought our data together, revealed again the chronicle's value, to say nothing of the value of joint research, and per- mitted us to document the image more exactly to Vig.ugupta's decade. 80so Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 87. s8 Vai?pava Iconology, p. 79- qz</page><page sequence="15">chisel of the same master sculptor of these clearly coeval works. By the seventeenth century the pulse which guided the unerring Licchavi-period chisel had long ceased to beat. An exhaustive stylistic analysis of the two images is precluded in this paper. But in lieu of epigraphic documentation, the style of the Bdldju image must be at least cursorily examined to establish its chronology and its rightful claim to pre-eminence in Nepalese art. The primary index which unmistakably asserts Balanilakantha to be a sculpture of the Licchavi period is its model- ling. For the body of Visnu is truly that of a god. Independent of bulging muscles or heroic postures, the divine prsence is serenely affirmed by the noble head, the columnar "conch shell" neck, the massive shoulders, the artfully modelled thorax, slender waist, firm but mounding abdomen, and ponderous thighs. The body is smooth and youthful, a well-proportioned prince in repose, but filled with life force, theprtna, pressing from within in search of form in the suave exterior volumes. Even the divine feet are not neglected, but are carved with a distinctive fleshy instep, with toes which respond to the foot's pressure against the immense, elastic coil of Ananta, the serpent couch, and with nails set into flesh, not stone. It is especially the superb face, however, which unerringly determines the chronological po- sition of the Bdlanilakantha Visnu (Figure 5). Although the nose is damaged, its original aquiline profile is unmistakable. The surviving sharp tip and nostrils are indistinguishable from the Badhainlakantha image. So also is the characteristic sensuous, pouting lower lip and the small, angular chin contrasted against a curious fulsomeness of cheeks and jowls. The faces of both sculptures are characterized by a noble expression and conform closely to the classical norms of Gupta sculpture. Such a remarkable face as that of Bdlanilakantha Visnu could only be envisioned in its time. For while the copying of earlier works was a characteristic of Nepalese art, it is a rare image which does not reveal the stylistic idiosyncracies of the age to which the copyist belongs. In support of this view we invite a comparison of the two corresponding Nilakantha faces with a Visnu MSidhava commissioned by Pratdpa Malla in A.D. I670 (Figure 6).82 While the latter image is unquestionably a competent carving for its time, the difference in conception and treatment of the face is clearly discernible. A comparison to be made further on in this paper between two other faces, one Licchavi, the other Malla, will once again reiterate this view. Discussion of the dress and ornamentation of the Blanilakantha image, together with the snake couch, must perforce be deferred. Examination of the accompanying illustrations will amply demonstrate their affinity with other sculptures of the Licchavi period. As an exception we will note only the superb crown, a coronet of three separate lobes, each a disc centered with a jewel-emitting Face of Glory, the kirtimukha, surrounded by a bead and petal border. The large central lobe, badly damaged, towers over and in size exactly equals the lower face. The Bi.dh~inla- kantha image wears in nearly perfect condition this same distinctive crown; it may be seen on the well-known Garudisana and Sridhara Visnu images ofCitigu NiriSyana, on the bronze Viivarapa of the Boston Museum,83 and in many other Nepalese images of Licchavi and early post-Licchavi date. We shall encounter this crown again, in certainly its most imposing version, on another donation of Vis .ugupta. Again, it is revealing how differently the seventeenth-century sculptor of the Visnu Midhava has interpreted what is meant to be the same classical crown (Figure 6). 82 Gautamavajra Vajrdcdrya and Mahe'arija Panta, "Rdnipokhariko narayanako abhilekha," Abhilekha-safgraha (V. S. 20zoI 8 Kdrttika [October 1961]), part 3, PP.- 24-25. 83 Pratapaditya Pal, "Vaigr.ava Art from Nepal in the Museum," Boston Museum Bulletin (1967), vol. LXV, no. 340, Fig.6, p.46. 93</page><page sequence="16">Two other factors relevant to a reappraisal of the chronology of the Bilaju image are its sur- face polish and size. Although the surface is now badly deteriorated, that it once enjoyed the lus- trous polish of Licchavi stone carving is evident. The left cheek, chin, and left breast, over which lies the delicate tracery of the sacred thread, retain an almost pristine, glossy sheen and small patches of polish are to be discerned scattered on the body and limbs. These survivals are quite evident in the accompanying illustrations (Figures 4, 5). The greater deterioration of this image, compared to the B-idhinilakantha Ndrdyana, may lie in a quality of stone inferior to that which Visnugupta took such pains to have dragged across the Valley for making the larger image. It may also be due to the rather casual veneration of Bilanilakantha. For once the daily pfji is concluded the image is left unattended. Hence the devotees, a sparse congregation now, and in noteworthy contrast to BNidhainflakantha, are not restricted from bearing their own offerings to the head. Moreover, the nearby village children have no compunction about total exploration of the composition in search of coins which have been offered to the divinity. Perhaps one of the most critical factors pertinent to a reappraisal of the Bdlanilakantha Visnu is its size. Indeed, it is to this special factor that the sculpture owes its present re-evaluation, for it was its monumentality which first made the accepted anachronistic dating of the Bildju image suspect.84 Prompted thus to reconsider the neglected Honorable Little One, only then did its style clamor for recognition. Dwarfed by the BadhIanilakantha to be sure, Little Nilakantha nonetheless is also an imposing monolith. It measures 14 feet 8 inches in length, 5 feet 6 inches in width, and in thickness is 3 feet 8 inches -statistics which reveal it to be a not inconsiderable work of art. While such monumentality is perfectly consonant with sculptures of the Licchavi period, it is rare in subsequent ages. Of literally thousands of extant Malla period stone sculptures known to the writers, we can recall but three monoliths which border on the monumental: a slightly more than 7 feet Jala'ayana Ndrdyana at Palaificok (Figure I8), the 7 feet 3 inches standing Buddha north of the Svayambhfindtha caitya, and the largest, an 8 feet 5 inches standing Visnu at Panauti. The standing Buddha at the western side of Svayambhiinitha, almost eleven feet tall, pre-dates the Malla period, and the few monumental images which are of the Malla and Siha period -for example, a crude seated Buddha at the northern side of Svayambhi, or the graceless ones along the eastern approach--are in nature architectural, for none are carved from a single stone. VI To the attentive reader it will be abundantly clear that nothing has been said about the attributes which the Bilanilakantha image holds in its four hands. They have been neglected because their complexity raises a new consideration in the reappraisal of the image-its iconographical identi- fication. For the hands of Bilanilakantha perhaps contain the key to the identification of the image as "catu[r]mirti Lord Visnu" and make its attribution to Visnugupta--and its chronological position, therefore,-more secure. These attributes are not those of JalaSayana Niriyana, the wheel, club, lotus, and the conch, as exemplified by the Badhtinlakantha image. Only two of 84 In this discovery Dr. Pratapaditya Pal, Curator of Islamic and Indian Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, had an indirect hand, for it closely followed his brief visit to Kathmandu, Summer 1971, a week spent in fruitful discussions of Nepalese art. Having considered at that time how monumentality was a characteristic of Licchavi-period art, later our unbidden thoughts turned to the anomalous Bdilju image and sent us scurrying to study it anew. 94</page><page sequence="17">Fig. I Jala'ayana Nirdyana, BfIdhdnilakantha.

The upper hands wield attributes exotic to him but emblematic of a number of other gods, among whom is Siva. These are the rosary (aksamdld) in the right hand, and a water pot (kamaidalu) in the left. In the Vaisnava cult treatises a Caturmiirti, or as it is also called, Caturvyiiha, image embodies the four vyihas, or emanations of the syncretic Vdsudeva-Visnu-Ndrdyana. These four vyfhas are the hero-god and fountainhead, Vdsudeva himself, plus three successive emanatory forms. The four vyfbas typify the different aspects (knowledge, lordship, ability, strength, virility, and splen- dor) of the supreme deity.Ss These multiple aspects rightfully should be represented in one of two ways: either as four addorsed standing figures, differentiated vyfhas (Figure 25) or undifferentiated Para-Vdsudeva (both forms common in Nepal), or a composite four-faced icon-human, lion, boar, and demon-known technically as Vaikuntha. "With such a body, the God, the greatest in the universe, sustains the whole world."86 The Bdlanilakantha image, then, is clearly not the Caturmfirti Visnu as prescribed by the texts. But neither is it the usual Jalagayana form as embodied in Bfdhdnilakantha. In fact, our image appears to offer a syncretism unique in the range of Indian and Nepalese iconography, in which the sculptor has symbolized something whose meaning, although perhaps recoverable, has been long forgotten. It is, moreover, perhaps this very distinctiveness, which equally bemused the chroniclers as to the image's identity and led them, for lack of a more appropriate name, to call it a "catu[r]mfrti Lord Visnu." For although in essential concept it must be Safnkara-Ndrayana (Harihara), half Visnu, half Siva, it does not conform iconographically to the prescribed form of this image any more than to a Caturm-arti or a Jala ayana Ndriyana. Syncretic images in which Siva and Visnu are joined seem to have been particularly popular in Nepal where sect differences have always been minimized if indeed not totally obliterated. But these images are universally divided on the vertical axis, as are the Indian examples, the dominant right half devoted to Siva, the left to Visnu.87 In most instances these are actually halfgods, each replete with his own distinctive hair or headdress, ornaments and clothing, at times each accom- panied by his respective consort and mount (the latter occasionally a ludicrous half-bull, half-bird), and each inevitably displaying two of his most characteristic symbols. These are for Siva normally the trident and the rosary, and for Visnu, the wheel and the conch. A characteristic icon of this type would be the Safikara-Ndrayana image near the Pa'upati south gate, an ornate replacement made probably in the sixteenth century, of a sixth century predecessor.88 Occasionally, however, s85 For further amplification see Jitendra Nath Banerjea, The Development of Hindu Iconography, znd ed. (Calcutta: Calcutta University Press, University of Calcutta, 1956 (hereinafter cited as Iconograpby)), pp. 386-388 and T.A.Gopinatha Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography. 2 vols.

I, pp. 227-244. 86 Banerjea, Iconography, p.409. 87 That giva is given the right half does not imply superiority over Visnu but reflects rather the position of the male partner. The left, or female, side is assigned to Vi.nu because he assumed the form of a beautiful woman, Mohini, so that he might bewitch the Asuras and cheat them of their share of the amrta, immortalizing ambrosia, churned from the cosmic ocean, and at which time, Siva, too, became enamored of Vi?:nu-Mohini. 88 Pal, Vaisnava Iconology, Fig. Io3 (note also Figs. Io4-io6). Of considerable interest is the lesson inherent in this particular composition with respect to the dating of Nepalese sculptures. The image stands upon, but not attached to, a pedestal dated, as first misread, Samvat 489, but now corrected to 487 [A.D. 565]. It bears a long inscription in honor of Lord 9afikara- NIrdyana who, of course, stands above it (Gnoli, Inscr. o20, p. 28). Dated inscriptions, one with the image, are of primary importance in providing incontrovertible landmarks in the history of art. It behooves us to treat circumspectly those which 11</page><page sequence="38">the Harihara concept is less explicit and we are given an image undifferentiated except by its cognizances, two of Siva on the right, two of Visnu on the left. Indeed, one of these undifferentia- ted Harihara images, flanked by the respective consorts, stands just a few feet from the Blanila- kantha image, identifying itself only through the paired cognizances of the two divinities, trident and rosary, wheel and conch (Figure 7). Except for the mixed attributes the syncretic image could as well be the Kumbheivara Siva (Figure io) or the Cdfigu Ndrdyan.a Sridhara Visnu. We know of no Harihara image, however, in which the distinction is made on the horizontal axis as the Blanilakantha sculptor seems to have done. Moreover, the image is not caused to display the common Harihara cognizances, but exhibits an altogether distinctive combination, as we have said. Despite the Bdlanilakantha's iconographic anomalies, we are nonetheless constrained, it seems, to accept it as a syncretic image in which Siva and Visnu are blended. As the names Hluti- keda and Paramesvara reveal, the Bdldju site was anciently associated with Siva. A curious text of probable sixteenth- seventeenth-century date, the Luntikelvara-purana,89 describes it as a Siva k.etra (locality, preserve) and the abode ofrsis. Nearby even now flows a small stream which bears Siva's name, the Mahddeva Khold. If indeed it was at Visnugupta's command that an image super- ficially Vaisnava was installed in a Saiva preserve, and actually symbolized both divinities, the BdIlanilakantha merely expressed the ruler's own eclecticism. For he was a king who declared himself devoted to Padupati's feet yet erected the most imposing Vaisnava images which ennoble Nepalese art. That his subjects and their descendants equally accepted the essential oneness of Siva and Visnu is also evident. The numerous surviving Harihara images attest to the syncretic outlook of the Nepalese and it is made particularly explicit by the entries in the Himavatkhaynda and the Nepdla-mdhitmya. These texts are studded with the Ndrlyane'vara concept, and the anomaly of a "Ndrdyana litiga" is not even considered. Contemporary attitudes toward the Bdlanilakantha image also help to clarify its iconography. For whereas most Nepalese presume the image to be Ndrdyana, the priests-Newar Srestha and Karmicdryas, not Brahmans as at B-idh~xnilakantha-feel some uncertainty about the nature of their charge. It is "neither Mahddeva nor Hari," they say, and therefore paint the Rdmatilaka, or Vaisnava symbol, in the center of the forehead, flanked by the Saiva tripundraka symbol. At the important yearly festival accorded the tirtha in general, the Hluti-punhi, and in which the image also shares, Brahman priests perform the homa (burnt-offering) sacrifice for Bdlanilakantha and explicitly name him Harihara. are associated, but detached, as is the pedestal of the Safikara-Nirdyana image. There can be no question, despite the cor- respondence of inscribed label and iconography of the image, that the present Safikara-NdrSyana - of a stone markedly different from the early pedestal - is not the one to which the inscription refers, but a banal replacement of the original. In every detail of style it proclaims itself to originate at the very earliest in a sixteenth-century Malla workshop. To correct "false speculations" the image, however, with an injudicious disregard for the anachronism of artistic style and inscription, has been adduced as dated proof of the appearance of both the flame halo and the double lotus base by the sixth century A.D. (Rameda Jafiga Thdpd, "Nepdli miartikald [Nepalese Sculpture]," Ramjham (V. S. 2027 A'vina [October 1970]), vol. 6, no. 3, PP. 24-25, n. 28). While conclusions thus drawn are invalid, to be sure, it so happens that not only the flame border but, of still greater importance, the flame in company with the bead does appear in Nepalese art by the mid-seventh, and possibly by the sixth, century. Such an early dating for the flame and bead motif will be soundly demonstrated further along in this paper. 89 RaIstriyabhbilekhalyastha-hastalikhita-pricina pustakinambrhatsacipatram [A Master Catalog of Manuscripts of the National Archives] (Kathmandu, V.S.zoz5 [1968]), part 8,pp.245-246, lists three copies, two in Devandgari and one in Newari. At the very outside the character of the text precludes a date prior to the late fifteenth century. II6</page><page sequence="39">If we are to penetrate the fundamental nature of the anomalous Harihara, however, we must examine the attributes more closely, for it is their purpose, after all, to symbolize the unrevealed nature of the divinity. Among these cognizances the most significant is the kamandalu, the mendi- cant's water pot, which the image displays in its upper left hand. Although the moss-covered emblem is now underwater, there is no question as to its identity. It represents a gourd flask, the kamalndalu, or as this small handleless form is identified in Nepal, the tumbi, here held crosswise in the upturned hand (Figure 8). A similarly shaped, handleless flask occurs frequently in the hand of Brahmd and of Siva, of Maitreya, the future Buddha, and, less commonly, in the hand of the Bodhisattva Padmap.ni Avalokite'vara. The serpent demigods also display it and numerous Tintric divinities count it among their multitudinous attributes. Moreover, in all these instances the tumbiis paired with a companion attribute, the aksamml, the former in the left hand, the latter in the right, just as they are held by Bdlanilakantha. Brahmd, for example, holds the tumbi paired with the aksamald in his well-known representation in Deupitan, in a small relief in Mrgasthali, Pa'upatindtha,0o and in a superb and little-known fifth-century image casually seated by the road- side in Cdpdgdui village (Figure 9).91 The tumbiis also displayed, and again with aksama~ld, in the hands of innumerable Siva mukhalifigas, in those of the circa twelfth-century Siva of Kumbheivara, Pdtan (Figure Io), and in the hands of a hitherto unpublished Siva, a work of probable ninth- century date which stands in a private garden in ViSlnagara, a suburb of Kathmandu (Figure i i). Two early images of Maitreya may also be cited in which the tumb! is held, again in combination with the aksamld. One is an accessory image enshrined in a vihdra in Cd-bahil (Figure i2), the other, unpublished, one of four addorsed figures-three Bodhisattvas and a Buddha-on a small stone caitya in a fountain at Ndg-bahil, Pitan.92 We have no Nepalese image with which to illus- trate these paired attributes in the hands of the nagas, but an example from Nalanda in nearby Northern India would be pertinent. It is a superb stone sculpture of sixth- or seventh-century date in which a Ndgardja, seated in royal ease upon and canopied by his alter-ego, a multi-headed serpent, holds disposed in the same way as the cited Nepalese images, these two critical emblems, tumbi and aksamdld.93 Moreover, in Nepal and with perhaps the greatest pertinence to the enig- matic Bilanilakantha image, we find Ananta, the Cosmic Serpent and personification of Visnu himself, holding the tumbiin his left hand, although the expected companion emblem in his right, the rosary, is absent. This is the recumbent, snake-couched figure at the base of the Cifigu Nird- yana Vilvaripa relief (Figure 13). The image has been identified as the Jalasayana Visnu himself,?4 as Ananta,9s and as Balardma.96 With the exception of the exotic and hitherto ignored attribute, the tumbi, which displaces the prescribed conch, all three identifications seem to be equally appro- 90 Thapd, "Nepdli mirtikald," Ramjham VI, 3, P1. 14. 91 Undated but with the donors' names, Kuberaguptah and Anikaguptah, inscribed in Gupta characters which compare closely to those dated to the fifth century and which predate epigraphic changes introduced in Amsuvarman's time, c.

For in this context Ananta is an incarnation of Visnu, and Balardma by iconographic asso- ciation with ndgas is himself believed to be an incarnation of Ananta.97 The inclusion of the tumbi in this particular composition, therefore, either serves a particular symbolic purpose, as it un- questionably does in the Bilanilakantha image, or perhaps more likely, the Ciingu sculptor inspired by the earlier model, merely preferred the exotic flask in lieu of the prescribed conch. That this is possible we know from other images, one of which we will meet further along in this paper, in which the Nepalese artist thrust aside the textual limitations to assert his own individuality. In the instance of the Bdlanilakantha image, however, the tumbiwas by no means a random inclusion but symbolizes the underlying ideology of this remarkable image. That the Bdlanilakantha is not an ordinary Harihara, anymore than it is an ordinary Jalasayana Ndrdyana is, as we have explained, self-evident. By the inclusion of the flask and rosary, the intent, if we may presume to probe the mind of a sculptor or donor thirteen centuries distant from our own, is threefold: i) to reinforce the well-known general symbolism of Visnu Anantasdyin; 2) to provide a clue to an intended specific local symbolism; and, as paired with the rosary, 3) to indi- cate a particular aspect of this deity essentially exotic to either the prescribed Harihara or the Jala"ayana form. The particular aspect of the deity, which rosary and gourd flask emphasize, is its yogic nature--that of the Supreme Yogi and archetypal ascetic, Siva,98 and of Visnu in his yogic aspect. Yogic forms of Visnu, seated or standing, and reclining on serpents are common in Indiag9 and some occur in Nepal. A yogdsana Visnu of probable early seventeenth-century date is enshrined near the Sundhdri, Deupdtan (Figure 14).100 Seated in yogic posture, the image by the cognizances, wheel and conch, held in the upper rear hands, proclaims itself to be Visnu. The forward hands forsake the prescribedyogamudrd to hold in his lap a sacred water vessel, the bowl- like kMalaa, pfrnyagha.ta, or kumbha. All of the accessory images spaced around the stele, or prabhd- vali, are also inyogdsana and hold the symbolic water vessel. Giva, at the apex, wielding damaru, double-headed drum, and trilila, the trident, seems desirous of concealing his kumbha, rather than displaying it as do the others. He exhibits it elsewhere in a more forthright manner where he and Umr, both in yogic posture, each ostentatiously make a show of the kumbha as primary insignia. As such they are utterly exotic in an otherwise typical Nepalese Umi-Mahesvara relief which stands in a fountain beside the Kumbheivara temple, Pdtan.io, The Bdlanilakantha image, despite its syncretic overtones and Saiva coloring, is then perhaps more correctly to be interpreted as Visnu Yogasayana. In general ornamentation and in two of the symbols, lotus and conch, the image is certainly Visnu, and the snake couch is also exclusively his. By adding to the latter the paired yogic symbols par excellence, the mendicant's gourd flask and the rudr9ksa-seed rosary, his yogic nature is affirmed.yoz- The rosary, symbolic of the never-ending 97 Banerjea, Iconography, pp. O103, 347, 420. 98 Naturally, in Harihara images in which Siva displays trident and rosary, both aspects, active and yogic, are symbolized but the yogic aspect is less explicit than in the Bdlanilakan.tha image where the rosary is paired with at least one other yogic symbol, the mendicant's water pot. 99 Rao, Elements, vol. I, pp. 79-92. 00oo The image may probably be dated with exactitude to A.D. 160o4, the date (Nepal Samvat 724 Kdrttika) which is inscribed on the lintel of a twin temple, one each of which stands on either side of the steps leading down into the Sundhdrd foun- tain. 1o0 Pratapaditya Pal, "Umd-Mahe'vara Theme in Nepali Sculpture," Boston Museum Bulletin (I968), vol.LXVI, no.345, Figure I1. t02 It might be noted that the well-known Vi.nu Yogagayana of Aihole has only his ordinary attributes depicted, arranged separately at either side of his head (Rao, Elements, vol. i, P1. XXXIII). II8</page><page sequence="41">cycle of Eternity, is equally with the gourd flask, tumbi or kamatnfalu,103 the inevitable companion of the yogi. He wears these symbolic seeds as a necklace, entwined in his matted locks, massed as a turban, displayed as an armband, or carried in the hand as a small rosary. The yogi's rosary, moreover, is identical with those carried in the hand by all our cited images among whom, of course, is also Bilanilakantha. Moreover, perhaps modern devotees are not so foolish as we think when they identify the lotus bud in the hands of both Nilakantha images, Bfidhd and Bila, as a ball of ashes (vibhbti). For as a guess, given the Nepalese artist's penchant for invention, perhaps it was cleverly intended to symbolize both, the true lotus cognizance of Visnu, and the vibhbti he, or Siva, would carry in yogic aspect. For the ash-ball, equally with the gourd flask and the seed rosary, evokes the yogi. It, too, is eminently his, carried in the hand and from which he bestows the symbolic .tikd, or tilaka, on the forehead of the worthy. It may be seen in the begging bowl of the rudrdksa-seed garlanded yogi photographed at Kumbheivara (Figure 15). Pal, too, suspected something of this yogic nature in the Bdldju image, suggesting it might be Visnuyoganidrd (the sleep of concentration) although he faltered in identifying with certainty the key symbolic element, the tumbi.xo4 Visnuuyoganidrd, however, is too simple an identification for this iconographically complex image. Its eyes, moreover, are fully open rather than half-closed as theyoganidrd aspect prescribes. The innate symbolism of Ndrdyana and the endless Cosmic Serpent, Ananta, floating on the watery abyss is too well known to need reiteration here.los All are one, "triune manifestations of the single divine, imperishable, cosmic substance, the energy underlying and inhabiting all forms of life."0o6 Circulating through the universe, accumulating in the familiar ponds and streams, filling the sacred kumbha, carried in the mendicant's tumbi and kamatdyalu, water is to man as am- brosia (amrta) to the gods. Visnu is its chief personification, but so also is the serpent, universal symbol of water, his familiar companion. But despite the obvious, explicit symbolism of Visnu- Ananta, the mind which conceived Balanilakantha, it seems, wanted to make a further point in this respect. This he did by joining to it the tumbi, itself symbol of the primeval waters whence spring all things animate and inanimate, and of amrta, the immortalizing elixir. VII The fundamental nature of Bilanilakantha, and its emphatic water symbolism, will be best under- stood by examining it, however briefly, within the context of the culture in which it was con- ceived and of which it remains an indissoluble part. In Nepal, more perhaps even than in India, water is itself the object of profound veneration, an attitude crystallized in the uncountable tirthas-rivers and streams, turbid ponds and crystal mountain pools, springs, and even seemingly common man-made wells. It is essentially to these waters, rather than the accessory images which 103s Although a distinction between the terms tumb! and kamaydalu is perhaps unnecessary for any symbolic reason, it might be preferable to adopt the Nepalese term, tumbr, to distinguish the small, handleless flask carried clasped in the hand from the larger handled vessel, fashioned from a gourd, of clay, or of brass, which is carried suspended from the hand. o04 Pal, Vaisnana Iconology, pp. 79-80. 105 See, for example, the masterful essays on this subject by Heinrich Zimmer, Myths andSymbols in Indian Art and Civilization, edited by Joseph Campbell (New York: Random House, 1946 (hereinafter cited as Myths and Symbols)), particularly pp. 27-53, 5 9-68, 72-90; Zimmer, Art, pp. 48-67 are also relevant; Banerjea, Iconography, pp. 344-351 ; Rao, Elements, vol.

Indeed, these paths are a web studded with countless holy places to which each Nepali once planned to find his way in the cycle of his life. And death, too, by preference is bathed by this magic stuff, and upon and within it the last corporeal matter, now ash, rejoins the sea. Among these tirthas one of the most important is the Fountain, or the Pool, of Siva, translated by diverse tongues in a variety of ways-Sivaluti, Siluti, Silu, Golahitidaha, Gosainkunda, Gosdinthina, and Nilakantha. As we have said, the tirtha lies in the high mountains, some I ,ooo000 feet above the level of the sea, between the foothills which ring the Kathmandu Valley and the still higher, snowclad ramparts beyond. It consists of a chain of limpid pools which, stairstep, descend the mountain's northern flank and from the lowermost of which, as a thunderous water- fall, the Trid'li River is born. By no means a natural phenomenon, the river in fact springs from the rock cleft by Siva's trident, the triidla, which he thrust here in his headlong plunge into the nearby pool. For it was to these chill waters in the Himalayan fastness the Supreme Yogi knew so well, that Siva rushed to slake his scalded throat. When churning the ocean for the promised amrta, the sparring gods and demons had caused poison also to well forth. To save his companion gods, Giva took the dreadful stuff into his own mouth, thereby scarring his throat and earning him his distinctive epithet, Blue-throat, or Nilakantha. Moreover, for those with eyes of under- standing, two rocks submerged in the pool which bears his name, are his recumbent form, the "Jalasayana Mahideva." Although one may perform the sacred Nilakantha pilgrimage at any time when the mountain passes are free of snow, normally late May to early November, the pre- ferred time, coinciding with the close of the rice-planting season, is at the August full moon, r~ivana-Bukla-pdrnimd. Although as the name and legend make clear, the tirtha is essentially Saiva, it is, consonant with the eclectic nature of Nepalese religion, not his alone, but of many other gods as well. For there beside the lifga is the stipa. There also is Sarasvati and there, too, are Visnu and Brahmd. The Himavatkhanda describes first Visnu, then Brahmd, toiling over the common pilgrim path to join the lonely Siva.oI7 Here they companionably repose together, each in his own pool, for a thousand years. But when each at last goes his way, as any pilgrim must, each leaves behind his name attached to the pool in which he slumbered and his essence therein. Bathing in these waters, then, brings man into intimate contact with godhead-which now is to say Siva and Visnu, for Brahmd, of course, has long ceased to count. The syncretic nature of the tirtha of the Pool of Lord Siva could be perhaps no better illustrated than by a scene from a Buddhist painting (Figure 16). The painting is a long, cloth banner, or paubha, which is annually displayed for a few days in Kathmandu in a venerable monastery famil- iarly known as Itumbahil. Thepaubha has suffered many restorations but in its present condition is essentially of seventeenth-century date. In this painting, as a minor episode among many events, the hero of the legend whose story is unfolded therein, makes the pilgrimage to Gosain- kunda. He, too, toils over the rocky trail and arrives at the mountain-girt pool. Around the edges are a few naked bathers, a cluster of yogis and some common folk. In the center of the pond resting on the surface of the water are two images. One is seated in yogic posture, an ascetic with matted locks piled into the ja.timukuta, the other lies on the water, the ankles crossed and the four o07 Ch.46, vv. 5-16, pp. Io02-z-03 and Nepali translation, p. 0oz I20</page><page sequence="43">arms arranged as a Jala'ayana Ndrayana. That both are meant to be Siva is evident by their color, white as prescribed for him, his third eye, a tripudrak sect mark, and his symbols, the amaru and triidla, both of which are also the common yogi's adoptive emblems (Figure 15). These painted images, despite all that the artist has carefully delineated, including a curling moustache on each face, are scarcely two inches in size, and even magnified it is difficult to ascertain the remaining symbols. Thejalasayana image seems to hold the rosary in his left hand and what can only be identi- fied as a vajra, the thunderbolt of Indra, the Adamantine Diamond of the Buddhists, in the right. The yogisana image also appears to hold a vajra between thumb and forefinger before the right breast, and, steadied by the left hand, a kumbha, or more likely bhik.pdtra, the mendicant's beg- ging bowl, in his lap. Since thepaubhd illustrates the history of the vihdra itself, is otherwise con- cerned with the consecration of Buddhist images, and represents the end result of successive restorations which may in part originate in the fourteenth century, it is possible that the vajra and arch-Buddhist symbol-if indeed it be-represents a restoration error. Perhaps in the instance of thejalalayana figure, where it is paired with the aksamild, it was originally the tumbi. In any event, minus snake couch, the image lies in the characteristic cross-ankled pose of Visnu Anan- taiyin. In this respect, random comments of the concourse of admirers-albeit sparse these days-who make their way hither during the Buddhist holy month, are themselves instructive. Too bemused to name the image for what it is, "Jalabayana Siva," an altogether unknown iconic type,0o8 they follow a more familiar path and call it "Bhuijasi Ndrdyana-dyo," the specific name for the Niryanga of Bi.dh~inilakantha. Some visitors, one-time pilgrims, too, avow to have them- selves seen this samejalasayana image of thepaubhdin the clear waters of Silu, the Fountain of Siva. That a tirtha devoted to Siva, and in which Visnu clearly shares, should figure in a Buddhist story about a Buddhist vihdra, and is undertaken and fondly recalled by Buddhists, is also instructive as to the universal nature of the Nilakantha tirtha. The waters of the tirtha of the Fountain of Siva not only descend to the Ganges in the tumult of the Trifaill River, but as tradition affirms, make their way also into the Kathmandu Valley by secret corridors. They emerge in two places. Silently welling forth in a crystal pool by the temple of the Lifiga of the Sacred Water Vessel, Kumbhe'vara, Ptan, the Gosdinkurnda mother waters make Kumbhe'vara, too, a tirtha of eminence. Indeed, when the celestial chalice from which all waters spring, the orb of the moon, waxes full in August, those who cannot undertake the arduous pilgrimage to the mountain Nilakantha, go to bathe in the pool at Kumbhe'vara. For all know the waters are one and the intimate contact with godhead therefore the same. This is affirmed by a foolish Pdtan duck who, last seen in the pool of Kumbhesvara, was found at length when "the owner, happening to go to Gosain Than, found it there."lo0 The waters of the Himalayan Fountain of Siva also enter the Valley by way of multitudinous springs which gush from the flanks of the mountain of the Rsi Arjuna of the Serpents, Nigarjuna. Among these springs, one is another Fountain of Siva, the ancient ParameSvara-pran5ll "where there is Lord Hari... the Nirlyana recumbent on Ananta." Here, then, at the ancient Siva ksetra, locale of Gosainkunda's very waters, it seems probable that Visnugupta established a second 08os Any layana images, other than Vi.nu and Buddha, are very rare. In late medieval representations Giva and other gods are sometimes shown prostrate under the feet of the triumphant deities of other sects, and there are also, of course, the nara- vdhanas, or human vehicles. But aside from these, which in any case represent accessory images, there are principally only two divinities depicted in recumbent pose, the Geqagayana Vign.u, and Buddha at death. 09oo Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. I67. 121I</page><page sequence="44">substitute tirtha. By so doing he added an important new dimension absent from the venerable Kumbhesvara substitute. This was the image of the BSilanilakantha, a miniature of the prodigious Jala'ayana Nilakantha believed to repose in the pool at Gosdinkunda, o and a miniature, more- over, in which Visnu, rather than Siva, is dominant. Hence the new image was at once a represen- tation of the mountain Nilakantha image, symbol of the terrestrial waters in general and the Gosdinkunda tirtha in particular, symbol of the locality's ancient proprietors, the Supreme Yogi and the rsis who had long enjoyed the spring-fed, jungle solitude, and symbol of an indigenous and water-related ndga cult, for that too is eminently there. Moreover, by incorporating all of these aspects into the body of Visnu, at oncejalaiayana andyogalayana, he assigned a pre-eminent role to his favored god. And for this complex role, and in a place closest to the source of the moun- tain-born waters, the elixir of life which surges forth and flows in undulating, serpent-like streams from the mountain of Arjuna of the Serpents, who more eminent than Visnu, its divine essence? For as the god himself asserts, "I am the Primeval Cosmic Man, Ndrdyana. He is the waters; he is the first being; he is the source of the universe ... I manifest myself as the Lord of Waters ... I am the cycle of the year, which generates everything and again dissolves it. I am the divine yogi, the cosmic juggler ... who works wonderful tricks of delusion."" The creation of a substitute tirtha is by no means uncommon in Nepal and of these one could cite endless examples. Bhipatindra Malla, king of Bhaktapur A.D. 1696 to 1722zz, erected in the palace square of his capital the Cdra Dhdma, four pitiful little shrines to which his subjects might more conveniently repair than to Jagannstha, Keddmrntha, Badrinitha, and Rdmesvaram, pro- digious tirthas of renown but inconsiderately placed at the four distant corners of India. Pratdpa Malla brought Khadgayogini's hilltop shrine above Safikhu to a more convenient substitute spot in the heart of his capital. There, too, is Kdgeivara, brought from another mountain slope, the st.pa ofNamo-buddha from still another, and the hilltop Vajrayogini of Pharpifig, has a substitute shrine on a knoll just outside of Pdtan. An even more intimate example is provided by Ndgdrjuna itself, or Jamdco as it is known in Newdri. The Buddhist riddha, or ritual for the dead, should be performed at the windswept stfpa which crowns the mountain, a mere 6oo000 feet compared to Gos'inkunda's i i,ooo. Yet nonetheless, here too we find a substitute tirtha, another stfpa barely on the slopes at all, a gentle ten-minute stroll from the Balanilakantha. The relevance of these latter-day examples to Visnugupta's time is not to be doubted, for Nepalese culture is a conti- nuum in which the present is firmly bonded with the Licchavi past. The new tirtha, Nilakantha conveniently brought down to the plain, must have enjoyed great 1I0 This was apparently once generally believed to be so, for early Western observers were informed that both images, Bidhi and BIla, were copies of the Himalayan progenitor. Kirkpatrick stated that Siva's repair to the mountain tarn "originated those representations of Mahadeo under the name of Neel-khent, which have been sometimes mistaken for the images of Narayer" and that the two Valley images were "both representations, on a small scale, of the Himma-leh Neel-khent" (Account, pp. 142, 310o). Oldfield, too, while affirming that "there is no kind of carving or representation of Shiva in any part of the whole Gosainthan" contradictorily described Biidhinilakantha to be "an exact imitation of the great and original Nil Khent, which does represent Shiva, at Gosainthan" (Sketches, vol. I, p.32, vol. 2, p. 339). Brown also stated that "pilgrims to distant Gosainthan fancy they can trace in the great unhewn rock... the shape of the god reclining full length upon a bed of serpents... [and] have constructed at least two much reduced representations of the lake and its deity in different parts of the Valley" (Picturesque Nepal, p. 184). We ourselves, who have also toiled over the pilgrim path to Gosainthdna, saw only two enormous adiacent boulders submerged in the icy pond, the largest ovoid, the smaller round, which could easily be interpreted by the believer as body and head of Nilakantha.

I:22</page><page sequence="45">popularity and, to judge by the comments of early Western observers,,,1 one which probably persisted into the nineteenth century. That an entire local "purc a," the Luntikevara, should be devoted to it is alone eloquent in this respect. In the early eighteenth century it was an important stopover en route to the mountain Nilakantha, as testified by Bhdskara Malla's three-day halt there, a half-hour distant from his own palace. Its waters, too, with those of Nilakantha, of Bi.dhd- nilakantha, of Kumbhe'vara, the Ganges, the ocean--in all fifty-one of the most famous tirthas of Nepal and India--were mingled in one vast substitute tirtha, the Rini Pokhari, which Pratipa Malla established just outside the gates of his capital. 11 Despite the new pond's sanctified waters "illuminated by the jewels of the hooded serpents"-the Kavindra's own words inscribed on the Visnu Mddhava (Figure 6)--the perverse public shunned it. Believing it to be ghost-ridden, its only attraction was as the preferred place for suicides. Similarly and mysteriously, the Nilakantha tirtha of Bildju, and the Honorable Little One who reposes in the pool, is now forgotten. None bathe in its waters, few worship there, and almost no one remembers that it is one with the lofty Nilakantha above. Indeed, on Srdvana-Sukla-pir.nimd, when the pond at Kumbhe'vara is an object of pomp and ritual, when it teems with festive bathers engaged in a rite of the spring plan- ting of which they have no ken, the imponderable eyes of Blanilakantha gaze up on the August moon alone. Yogis, it seems, are not quite divorced from the ancient site nor from the dictum that a "ygi should worship the yiga form of Vishnu.",14 Our time is witness to a metamorphosis in which Bdlanilakantha will one day be forgotten even by the yogis. But it is they who now still honor him and indeed, by their so doing, unconsciously but unequivocally illuminate the entire relationship of the lesser Nilakantha with the prodigious progenitor nestled among the peaks above. The "pierced-ear," or kdnapha.t.tad yogis of Mrgasthali, Padupatinitha, perform an annual pilgrimage in the name ofVisnu and Siva, the Hari-Safikaraydtrd, as they call it. In this, the complex ramifica- tions of which discussion must be deferred, they make a pilgrimage to Nilakantha for the pre- scribed August bathing of themselves and, more particularly, of their patron deity, the Siddha Goraksandtha. The latter, majestically and at ease performs the arduous journey secreted in the folds of a towering yogic turban. But his companions, bare-footed and in loin cloths, tumbled locks and enormous earrings, carrying kaman.dalu and aksamdld in hand, go on foot, as indeed all pilgrims save Goraksandtha must. But what is of profound interest to our reappraisal of Blanila- kantha, the yogis, too, like King Bhdskara Malla, halt at Bdl1ju going and returning, and- demonstrating beyond doubt the intimate relationship of the three waters-end their odyssey at Kumbheivara. Returning again to Mrgasthali, bearing with them the distant Nilakantha's sacred water, thejalapras da, in the ascetic's water pot, the kamavdalu, they await the waxing of the next August moon. Then in a timeless cycle of unknown beginning and unimaginable end, they leave for Nilakantha on the heights above and touch in their passage the two lesser manifestations of its waters, Little Nilakantha and Kumbheivara, in the beautiful Valley below. The metamorphosis we mentioned---in the mysterious way of man with his gods-is that 112 Kirkpatrick, Account, p. 141; Levi, Le N'pal, vol. 2, p. 3 53; Brown, Picturesque Nepal, pp. I80-181. 1r3 Clark, "The Rdni Pokhri Inscription, K.thm.n;du," BSOAS XX, pp. I67-187. These tirthas are listed in the dedicatory inscriptions, four almost identical stele, one of which is lost, which were set up at shrines at four corners of the pond. In two of these the Kumbhe'vara tirtha is mentioned by that name, and in another (ISPP, main part, p. 83) it is called Komati which, together with Sarve'vara, is an alternate name of the P.tan tirtbha. x11 Rao, Ekments, vol. 1, p. 79- 123</page><page sequence="46">Visnu Yogagayana, who must certainly once have been the principal object of the Bdldju halt on a yatrd consecrated in part in his name, now plays but a minor role in the yogis' affairs. s For it is no longer Ndrdyana whom they chiefly come to worship, but incredibly the nearby ajima, a venerable mother goddess, Kusdna in style, one-time aspect of a serpent cult, and in contemporary cultural context Sitali, personification of smallpox. But to the yogis she is Umi, consort of Siva, and it is to her that Goraksanitha primarily comes to make obeisance. At the same time the yogis make a perfunctory visit (darsana) to another mdi, a second mother goddess, submerged in a nearby spring and offering in her forward hands, in the same immutable gesture of Visnu in Deupitan, of Siva and Umd at the temple of the Lifiga of the Sacred Water Vessel, the symbolic vessel of water, the kumbha. At Kumbheivara, too, it is another "Gitald" whom the yogis worship, a long-forgotten Visnu in disguise, and "Krsna," a magnificent Vdsuki, king of the serpents, images perhaps already old when Mdnadeva, the first documented Licchavi king, ascended the throne of Nepal.1 6 VIII Summing up the two Nilakantha images, Bf.dhd and Bdla, we must suppose that both were indeed created at Visnugupta's command. But their long-accepted chronological relationship must be reversed, it seems. For almost certainly, although both no doubt may be assigned to the same decade, circa A.D. 633 to 643, the approximate duration of Visnugupta's influence, it is Badini- lakantha, rather than Balanilakantha, which is the royal copy. Although Bdlanilakantha was a stupendous composition, in beauty, in size, and in iconographic complexity, we must conclude that it did not wholly fulfill Visnugupta's desires. Perhaps he wished an equally distinctive image of Visnu alone--neither in his yogic aspect, nor symbolic of a tirtha, nor combined with Siva. More probably, as the discussion of what must have been his final donation will soon attest, the image did not satisfy his burgeoning conception of grandiosity. The mind of this shadowy ruler of long ago, now given a certain substance by the recovery of his remarkable artistic legacy, demanded something still larger, an even more clamorous symbol of his own stature. Thus prom- ted he commanded the same master artisan to make a titan of such dimensions as few predecessor kings had dreamed, and for it offerred the best available material, the great block of stone from distant Kotkhd. And while the Badhinilakantha image cannot be dislodged from its rightful Ss And it must be remarked, the Padmap.ni Avalokiteivara plays even less. But that he once did is almost certain. This is proclaimed by the intimate relationship of Matsyendrandtha, the adored patron of the Valley and teacher of the Siddha GorakSandtha, both of whom are inextricably enmeshed in a complicated legend, agricultural in origin, in which drought and rain-bestowing serpents play their expected role. Matsyendranitha is himself a syncretic Padmap.ni, whose symbols like Balanilakantha's, too, are rosary and vase. Padmapini, favorite deity of the nigas, shares Giva's white color and some- times his snake-entwined trident, and has common functions with Vi.nu. Moreover, at the untidy little shrine of Gorak- panatha, under the great pipal tree by the gateway to Taleju temple, Kathmandu, we find our clue that this former intimacy was a fact. For outside but flanking the symbolic feet of Gorakpandtha, enshrined in a symbolic cave within the tree itself, are four images: Vaikuntha -Kamalaji, i. e., half-ViSnu, half-Lakgmi, she with one of her symbols the sacred water vessel, a six-armed Garuda, who also displays rosary and water vessel, a Sivayogdsana, and then, among all this Hindu Siva-Vitnu concourse, the Bodhisattva Padmap.ni. Here, rather than with rosary and vase, he is depicted in his more familiar pose with lotus in hand. Further investigations are needed, to be sure, to bring into focus the complex and altogether wonderful things revealed by the "discovery" of Balanilakantha. 16 These images, together with the Biliju Sitala, have been introduced by Mary Slusser, "Nepali Sculptures, New Disco- veries," in Aspects of Indian Art, ed.Pratapaditya Pal (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1972), pp.93-1o4. A more thorough study of these and related images is projected. 124</page><page sequence="47">place among foremost Nepalese contributions to the world of art, we believe it falls short of the superb, smaller companion Nilakantha. If so, it is a repetition of the commonplace axiom that a copy, however excellent, is lesser than the original. The sculptor's creative energy, passionately, patiently, and dexterously were poured into the Biliju creation. Thus spent, Badhlnilakantha profited only by the great artificer's undiminished skill. Again the reader is invited to contrast these two splendid faces and consider for himself which is the more divine. The B~ila- and Ba&lt;dhi- prefixes, then, rather than young and old, meanings which have obscu- red their true relationship, in this context denote their cognate meanings, small and large, minor and major. The Bildju image was almost certainly first simply called "Nilakantha," like the mountain progenitor and as the personification of the famous tirtha it symbolized. With the crea- tion of a still more titanic titan, it became necessary to distinguish between the two superficially similar lowland images, one small, the other large. The Nirdyana of Narasimha-sthdna, except by its general symbolism of Visnu the Cosmic Waters, lay outside the orbit of the three related tirthas, the mountain Nilakantha, and the two substitute sites below, Little Nilakantha and Kumbhes- vara. But by extension it too became Nilakantha, but Blue-throat Senior as distinguished from Little Blue-throat, its exquisite junior model. Without wishing to labor the point, but perhaps in a manner of speaking-and in individualistic Nepalese style-Bilanilakantha although not a Caturmarti, was in fact a caturmfrti: Siva the Yogi, the yogic Visnu, Nilakantha (for a tirtha, too, is divine), and Ananta-Balarima-Visnu in the body of the Cosmic Serpent within whose jewelled hoods and vast coils the triune anthropomorphic divinity reclines. Perhaps, too, Nilakantha, and at length Bilanilakantha, were only the names bestowed by the common folk. But to those who understood the sculpture's syncretism and its remarkable underlying symbolism, it may have been Nidryaneivara. For as the Himavatkhantda explains, "Nepal is beautified by the presence ofNiraya- negvara who dwells in the water and is incessantly served by genii."117 IX Before taking up the remaining Gupta donations which the Gopalara'a-vama-ali records, it will be pertinent to note still a third immense Jala'ayana Ndrdyana image which, almost incredibly, adorns the tiny Kathmandu Valley. It is also of Licchavi date and despite its location in the heart of Kathmandu, like Bilanilakantha, has been figuratively lost. This image (Figure r7) is in the grounds of the old royal palace, Hanimin Dhoka, in an area closed to the public. But again it is the chronicles-this time of the nineteenth century-which have permitted us to resurrect this major but unseen early image. It was installed by Pratipa Malla, who canalized the waters of the Ba&lt;;dh1hilakantha pool to supply that of the palace image. Like the famous Kiliyadamana image, in which the child-god Kfrs.a chastizes the troublesome serpent Kiliya, and others which Pratipa Malla is known to have brought into the palacels the Hanamin Dhoki Jaladayana Nirlyana also was brought from elsewhere. The chronicle edited by Wright, written some two centuries after the event, states that Pratipa Malla "built Bha[n]darkhal (in the durbar [italics ours]), and made a tank. He then went to consult Jalasayana Narayana, and was told not to make an image for this 17 Ch.70, v. 44, P. 155 and Nepali translation, p. 162. 1s Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 146; Pal, Vai;ava Iconologv, pp. 88-90, Fig. 5 1. 12J</page><page sequence="48">tank, so he brought an old image, which was lying in a pond near Gyaneswara [an eastern suburb of Kath- mandu, italics ours], and placed it in the tank.", 19 Inexplicably, this perfectly clear passage seems never to have been closely read.I20o Ironically, too, rather than guide scholars to an early image it merely caused another major one, the Bilani- lakantha, to be also figuratively lost. Unfortunately it has not yet been our privilege to inspect the image itself,2, and our analysis of it has perforce been limited to a poor photograph reproduced herewith (Figure 17)'-22 But a close study of this reveals the stylistic affinity of the Hanamain Dhok. image with the Nilakantha sculptures and establishes it almost beyond question as roughly contemporaneous with them. The exact size of the image is unknown to us, but it is variously reported to rival that of Badhinilakantha or to approximate that of Bilanilakantha. Father Giuseppe, a Capuchin monk who resided in the Valley at the close of the Malla period, described the image thus: "At Cat'hmandu, on one side of the royal garden, there is a large fountain, in which is one of their idols, called Narayan. This idol is of blue stone, crowned and sleeping on a mattress of the same kind of stone and the idol and mattress appear as floating upon the water. This stone- machine is very large: I believe it to be eighteen or twenty feet long, and broad in proportion; but well worked, and in good repair."I.3 We know that previous to Visnugupta's two monumental works there already existed at least one other Jalasayana Ndr.yana in the Kathmandu Valley.I24 We have already alluded to it, the Bhumbhukkik. Jalasayana mentioned in an inscription of Amsuvarman in A. D. 6o8., 2s Unfortunately, Bhumbhukkik. can no longer be identified. It is eminently possible, however, that patient research may establish it to have been in the area now known as Gyineivara, or more properly J i-nesvara, '26 which the chronicles say was the provenience of the Hanamin Dhok. image. Thus we would have for the Hanamin phokd image at least an early seventh century terminus ad quem corresponding to Amiuvarman's mention of it. 119 Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 145. There are corresponding accounts in other chronicles (Bhisdvamidvali, part 2, p. 87; Hasrat, History, p. 75). I20 The most recent important occasion being Pal, Vaisnava Iconology, p. 17I, n. 30. 12x When the realization came upon us that the Hantiman p.hokd image must be an ancient one, the image was totally sub- merged by the monsoon rains. Our petition to the Royal Palace for access to the grounds and permission to clear and study the derelict image was not successful. 122 The authors consider themselves extremely fortunate that a brief visit to Kathmandu, already noted, of Dr. Pratapaditya Pal, Curator of Indian and Islamic Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, coincided with the completion of the first draft of this paper which he kindly read. We therefore benefited immeasurably from Dr. Pal's counsel, criticism, and more especially his professional opinion concerning several of the rather startling discoveries we felt we had made. It was particularly through Dr. Pal that a photograph of the Hanamin phokd image was obtained and it was our joint study of it that settled the last remaining doubts about the antiquity of the image which otherwise could only be surmised from the chronicle's statement. We are very cognizant of Dr.Pals's considerable contribution to this paper and we take pleasure in acknowledging it here. The reader hardly need to be told the debt the paper also owes to Dr.Pal's Vaisnava Icononology and many other publications in Nepalese art. Without them our voyage through the essentially uncharted waters of Ne- palese art history would have been infinitely more difficult. a23 Father Giuseppe, "Account of the Kingdom of Nepal," Asiatick Researches (London, 180oi), vol. 2, p. 354. 124 There may have been others for the late chronicles list four. These names vary but include the Bazdhnilakantha and Gydne'vara (Haniimdn Dhokd) images plus two others of variable and unidentified names, Vdnesvara/Vige'vara and Avasthdn/Svasthdna (Hasrat, History, p.28; "Rdjabhogamdl," Ancient Nepal 8, p. 19; Sarmd, editor, "K.thmandu- upatyakako eka rijavam.dvali," Ancient Nepal 4, p. 6). Since quartets of gods of various kinds, each assigned to a specific quarter of the Valley, were popular at least by the late Malla period, it is possible that the chroniclers merely invented one or two Jala'ayanas to round out the characteristic four-part scheme. 25s Gnoli, Inscr. 36, p. 50 (edited by D.Vajricirya, "Licchavikalamd dhdrmika saligha," Parnimd 14, p. I23). 126 We believe the pond may be the Kamala Pokhari, just east of Old Kathmandu and on the edge of the Gydnesvara suburbs, but further research is needed to establish this with certainty. I26</page><page sequence="49">In addition to these three imposing Licchavi-period sculptures, there is only one other large Nepalese Jalasayana Ndrdyana known to the writers. It lies neglected in a dry, mountain-side shrine at Pandali [prattdli] village near Palaficok, some twenty-five miles east of Kathmandu (Figure I8). It is a crude, provincial work, slightly more than seven feet long, and can be dated to the late fourteenth century. It was a donation of Madanasimha Rdma,'7 who with his brother Jayasimha, donor of the new Padupati litiga, belonged to the powerful Rimavarddhana family. For the greater part of a century they were masters of the Bhotarajya, an area between the eastern limits of the Valley and the Sunkosi River.128 The large Visnu image at the temple of Panauti Indreivara MahNideva, briefly mentioned previously, is undocumented but may probably also be attributed to the Rdmavarddhanas. Both large images were, like those ofVisnugupta long before, no doubt equally expressive of power as well as of piety. X Returning to the Gop laraja-vatmjdvali and the last of Visnugupta's recorded deeds, we may recall that "at Pa'upati on the eastern bank of the Vdgvati he established a large stone image of Lord Visnu of the size of his own body, together with two other images the size of his two sons on either side of it." Thus guided it has been possible to locate still another totally unsuspected major image of the Licchavi period. For once again the chronicles prove eminently reliable in the cul- tural domain and we do find "at Padupati on the eastern bank of the Vdgvati" a large stone image of Lord Visnu together with two smaller figures (Figure 19). But they are in disguise in the modern Rdmacandra temple where as extremely popular images--a colossal central figure some twelve feet tall flanked by two child-like ones-they are worshipped as Rdma with his sons Lava and Ku'a. At first glance, because of the gaudy decorations bestowed upon them by their admirers, the images would be dismissed as very late, or at the very best the Rdma-Lava-Ku'a group Sthiti Malla is said to have erected just here.'29 All three figures are swathed from neck to mid-shin in tinsel-trimmed, yellow robes, their eyes capped with silver foil, their lips painted ruby, and their feet sheathed in gilt copper boots. These adornments together with the daily offerings of flowers and fruit which bedeck them, effectively conceal almost the totality of the original figures. Indeed, except for the three faces, the nimbus, arms, and symbols of the larger image, a few inches of shins, and part of the base on which all stand, one can see nothing of the original composition. The problem is further compounded by the fact that even the visible parts are thickly coated with black oil. Nonetheless, the principal image is clearly not RIma but Visnu with the characteristic disposition of his distinctive symbols, wheel and club, lotus and conch. Despite the fact that these disfigured, moonlike faces can only be studied within the dim shrine distantly and frontally, it is not difficult to see their affinity with the Nilakantha faces. The thick pouting lower lip is parti- cularly evident as is the characteristic pointed chin carefully delineated against the well-fed cheeks and jowls. Even the hawklike curve of the noses may be surmised from the pattern of highlights seen in photographs made by electronic flash. This is particularly evident in a detail of the child- 127 Dhanavajra Vajricdrya, "SaktiSili bhdirddra Rdmavarddhanahar-i ra titkllika Nepal [The Powerful Rdmavarddhana Nobles and Contemporary Nepal]," Parnima (V. S. 2022 Kirttika [October 1965]), vol. 2, no. 3, issue 7, PP. 34-35* 128 Ibid., pp. 12-36; Petech, Mediaeval History of Nepal, pp. 145-154. 129 Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. I24. I27</page><page sequence="50">ren's faces which we have not illustrated. The principal figure also has the same long, slit ears as the Nilakantha images, from which are suspended equally heavy ornaments, unseen but whose bulk impedes the cloth robe from fitting around the neck. The large, barred disc earrings of the children may be closely compared to a number of other images which would have been roughly contem- poraneous, viz., Prthvi at Dhumvirihi (Figure 22), the H.digaiu Garuda, and many others. Certainly the most distinctive element of the visible part of the composition is the vast kirtimukha crown which surmounts the towering Visnu. Like the Nilakantha images, and other Licchavi period sculptures we have already mentioned, it is also three-lobed. And like them each lobe is a separate disc with the striking, jewel-emitting Face of Glory surrounded by a pearl and petal border. The crown's towering central crest, here exceeding in size the massive face, is clearly derived from the high crown displayed by Visnu images of the fifth century from Mathura.130 Although one of the Mathura images is only a little more than three feet tall, in each image, both Nepali and Indian, the great crown further enhances the monumentality of the figures. Despite the tawdry, feminizing robe--product of misguided ritual--the powerful physique of the Pa'upati Visnu asserts itself. With its broad shoulders, slender athletic waist, and firmly planted columnar legs, the image must have more than fulfilled Visnugupta's desires. For the artist presented his royal patron with an idealized portrait, a superman, the mahdpurusa, pulsing with the power, majesty, and even divinity of which Visnugupta no doubt imagined himself to be possessed. As for the princes, one yearns to see unhampered the artist's total vision of these two sturdy, well-fed youths. Oil and paint are no more able to conceal the true character of the arms of the principal image than the gown the body. One may clearly see the distinctive curve of Visnu's raised forearms, an unmistakable convention of early Nepalese images. Moreover, the mobile fingers of flesh and blood which hold aloft the cakra andgadad need only to be compared with those of the Nilakantha images, and contrasted with those of the Rini Pokhari Visnu, to understand exactly in which period they belong. Indeed, despite all that has been unconsciously contrived to conceal the image from us, there can be no question whatsoever that we have before us another magnificent work of Visnugupta. To see it in the full majesty in which it was conceived, the best one might hope, perhaps, is to assist at the abhiseka, or ritual bathing, when the ornaments and paint are briefly removed for annual renewal. Then for a brief moment would emerge again the portrait of a Gupta king, a resplendent and majestic Visnu, and his princely sons. A scarcely visible feature of the image which is, however, of over-riding interest in art- historical studies, is the flame and bead bordered nimbus framing Visnu's head. Exactly when the flame and bead border appear together as a decorative edge of aureoles is a controversial issue. It is generally believed to have appeared about A.D. 800 after which it became a common feature in many areas. However, the Padupati Visnu must be dated to the decade ofVisnugupta's influence, between the last document of his father, Jisnugpta, A.D. 633 and the first of his Licchavi suc- cessor, Narendradeva, A. D. 643. Hence, our resurrected image provides the first incontrovertible evidence of the appearance of this distinctive motif as early as the mid-seventh century. Bead and flame also border the halo of Krsna in the Haniimin .Dhoki Kiliyadamana composition, a work 30o Zimmer, Art, vol. 2, Pl. lo4; Pal, Vai.snava Iconology, Fig.23. The comparison of the Padupati and Mathura crowns was suggested by Dr. Pal. 128</page><page sequence="51">variously assigned to the sixth or the seventh century.13 Moreover, we have still another incon- testable evidence of its early appearance--and in this instance conveniently stamped with an exact date, A.D. 64o---on the Bhimdrjuna-Visnugupta inscription of Yafigal-hiti (Figure 3). For the stele is completely bordered by the flame and bead motif, already well-developed and stylized at this early date.'3 The Bhgrfigre'vara inscription of A. D. 641, previously mentioned with relation to the Biidhainflakantha image, also bears a version of this distinctive border. We witness the development of this motif on still earlier inscriptions, beginning in the last decade of the sixth century, in which both elements appear but have not yet been juxtaposed. a3 In these the bead is employed as a device to demarcate the decorated upper portion of the stele from the in- scribed portion below. The flame serves only to border the decorative portion or of a cakra within it. In addition to these inscriptions, where both flame and bead appear, there are many others which employ one or the other motif.14 Of these the earliest, in which there is a cakra surrounded by nascent flames, stands in the fields below Caukitdr village, an inscription ofVasan- tadeva, dated Samvat 45 4 [A.D. 5 32].3s Further, on sculptures, we believe that in Nepal the devel- oped flame and bead border actually can be traced as early as the sixth century, a date which, however, cannot be substantiated by epigraphic evidence. For instance, the standing Buddha of Bafigemaidhd-tol, Kathmandu (Figure 20), which stylistically cannot be dated later than the sixth century, exhibits the flame and bead bordered stele. The flames are still nascent and summary and are inside the bead border in an arrangement which compares with the Padupati Visnu nimbus. Moreover, flames without beads appear on the nimbus of another Gupta donation, to be dated we believe between c. A.D. 567 and 590o. The discussion of this image, however, we shall defer for the moment. Despite our inability to inspect the Pasupati Visnu at close quarters it seems certain that this towering composition is monolithic. For Visnu's lower hands are carved as one with the flanking images and all three figures despite their concealing boots, must be firmly anchored as a unit with the broad supporting base. The image is free-standing and attests to the consummate skill of its creator's sense of balance and distribution of weight. For it has apparently calmly withstood more than thirteen centuries of quakes, incessant scourge of the Valley, which have doomed countless lesser creations. The broad base is carved into the symbolic mountain pattern, so characteristic of Gupta and Licchavi art, and in the Kathmandu Valley a convention imitated into modern ti- mes. A fragment of the original stone which escaped oiling on the forehead of one of the children, suggests it to be the same excellent stone of the Biidh=nilakantha image. The high quality of the stone perhaps accounts for the remarkable preservation of this image--which has unquestionably 131 Pal, Vaistnava Iconology, p. 89, Fig. 5 I, considers it to belong to the sixth century. Stella Kramrisch, The Art of Nepal, p. 25, Pl. IV, dates it circa seventh century. 132 This startling discovery was made in concert with Dr. Pal as we sat far into the night excitedly discussing some of the ma- terial presented in this paper. For the realization struck us simultaneously that the photograph of the Yarigal-hiti inscription we held in our hands provided a stamped date for the flame and bead motif a century and a half anterior to what we had hitherto believed. Later, working with an enlarged photograph of the Pa'upati image, the authors were able to discern the bead and flame border on the nimbus, a decoration which cannot be detected in a smaller photograph and only sus- pected on the dark and unapproachable enshrined image itself. 133 Gnoli, Inscrs.25, P-.33, Pl.XXIX; 29, pp. 38-39, Pl.XXXIII; 52, pp.68-69, P1.

To the extent the image may be inspected the only damage to be detected is one little finger broken from Visnu's club-wielding hand. This arresting image of Visnu at Padupatindtha is infinitely more than a remarkable object of art, for it also provides an insight into the character of the imperious king who commissioned it, and in a way perhaps no written document could. What consummate pride led to the commission- ing of his own portrait in the likeness of a colossal divinity! And to join with it his young princes --one no doubt the Crown Prince Sridhara-personified as two of Visnu's divine weapons. For this indeed is the princes' role, that of the Ayudhapurusas, or personified attributes. The one beneath Visnu's outstretched right hand, which displays the lotus bud, is Padmapurusa, that on the left, Safikhapurusa. In the latter instance, the conch shell, if present at all, is invisible under Visnu's downturned fingers, but must be there since the other three emblems are otherwise accounted for. These anthropomorphizations of padma and lakha are also of considerable iconographic interest. For whereas Cakrapurusa and GadSinri are commonly found from the early Gupta period on, the personification of the conch, and infinitely more so the lotus, is very rare. This uncommon representation may have been ordained because of Visnugupta's insistence that his sons also be included in the composition. As gadindri must perforce be depicted as female, the cakra and gadd combination were precluded and the artist had no alternative, if he were to obey the ruler's command, but to substitute the less orthodox pair of padma and laskha. Otherwise the images follow the textual recommendation that Visnu's hands should rest on the Ayudhapu- rusas. The idealized royal portrait, such as Visnugupta's, had a long tradition. This is attested by the incident in Bhisa's drama, Pratimd ndtaka, wherein Prince Bharata steps into the royal portrait gallery in which his recently deceased father King Da'aratha's portrait has been already installed, but fails to recognize his own father. Portraiture, of course, was much favored by the Kusina kings, who as a symbol of their claim to be sons of heaven, encircled their heads with a halo. It is perhaps their exaggerated, superhuman portraits which were Visnugupta's inspiration for his own monumental composition. Moreover, he had models closer at home, for there is little ques- tion that portraiture was a popular affectation by other Nepalese, both kings and commoners. 36 In these, however, there was a vast distinction. For almost universally, from the Licchavi period even to the present-and countless examples might be cited-the mortal, even if a king, is re- presented as of modest size and in a humble, devotional attitude before divinity.37 At most, others dared no more than to represent themselves in the guise of Visnu's faithful servant, Garuda. It is more than possible, for example, that the H.digadi Garuda is a portrait of the Gupta, Anuparama, and that it is the moustached face of the first documented Licchavi king, Manadeva, who gazes at us in the guise of the monumental Citigu Ngrlyana Garuda (Figure 21)."8 It was Visnugupta 136 Pal, Vaisnava Iconology, pp. I8-zo20. 1a7 The single exception known to us is a gilt image of Vi.nu Hrsike'a which King YakSa Malla donated A.D. 1467 in the memory and according to the proportion of his deceased son (Regmi, Medieval Nepal, part 3, p. 80). S as Pal, Vaisnava Iconologv, pp. I I9- z20o. The date of the Cdigu Garuda is unresolved as is the question of whether it ever did surmount the inscribed pillar dated A. D. 464. As is well known, the famous pillar stood before the temple door, where a stub still remains, but was brought down either by a natural calamity or perhaps in a raid, either that of the Muslims or one of the many destructive ones of the Tirhutiyds. Given the massivity and size of the Garuga-more than four feet tall- it hardly seems it could have survived such a fall. But the image is scarcely damaged except for a cleft on the head--caused by Vis.u's cakra claim the priests, since the god felt that Garuda's position on the pillar elevated above his own seat was 130</page><page sequence="53">alone, it seems, who had the unparalleled audacity to have himself represented in the very body of the divinity; and this, moreover, of superhuman size and imperious manner, with his own offspring as the god's divine emblems. As a speculation, one cannot help but wonder if this un- bridled arrogance of Visnugupta may not have cost him his throne and at last halted the ever- burgeoning Gupta influence.39 As long as the Guptas showed the proper deference to the lawful Licchavi dynasty-as they heretofore circumspectly had-they perhaps aroused no serious popu- lar resistance. But Visnugupta, by the assumption of divinity in such an awe-inspiring image as the Padupati Visnu, may have overstepped the toleration point and brought against himself an outraged people. Rallying to the lawful dynasty they saw to it that neither Padmapurusa nor Safikhapurusa succeeded to the throne but that Narendradeva, alone, took his rightful place thereon. XI We have still not exhausted our unbelievably fruitful passage of the Gop larafa-vamidvali. It will be remembered that in addition to Visnugupta's overwhelming contributions to Nepalese art, the passage also records those of his grandfather, Bhfimi- or Bhaumagupta. The compilers are able to recall only two achievements of this obviously politically important and long-lived per- sonage, a man who for more than three decades of the sixth century was variously a king or the incumbent of the two highest posts in the land. But with the characteristic emphasis of the chronic- les, both of Bhaumagupta's remembered deeds are in the cultural domain-that he introduced the use of a script named Goli, and that he consecrated an image of "Dharafnivardha Visnu." Of the new script there is no trace in contemporary epigraphy and we must assume that either we are ignorant of something which did transpire or, perhaps more likely, that in this instance the chro- niclers have erred. The Dharani-Var~iha Visnu, however, we believe to be the well-known VarIha avatdira, or Boar incarnation, of DhumvirIhi, Kathmandu (Figure 22). We have no epi- graphic support for our contention, as in the case of the Bfidhkinlakantha image, nor any specific index to location as for the Bilanilakantha and Pasupati Visnu. But there are other indications, if less eloquent, which make the identification almost certain, if not absolute. There is no confirmation that Dhumvdrihi Vardha is the image to which the chronicles refer, but it is the only extant image which might qualify. For with the possible exception of a small composition set into the east wall of the Siddhi Pokhari, outside Bhaktapur, later copied exactly in intolerable. On the other hand, if it was originally placed on the ground, as Dr. Pal believes, there are two questions to be answered. Why was such an obviously important image not placed directly before the temple door, either in front or behind the pillar, since donors of all ages are preferably so placed ? This preferred space must have at that time been unencumbered for eighteenth-century Malla royal portraits enjoy this privilege now. As attested by comparisons with other sites, they would not have pushed the earlier image aside and usurped the prime place, but rather would have accommodated themsel- ves to the available space. And why was the Garuda pushed so incongruously and unnecessarily against the face of an inscribed stele of givadeva, so that the latter actually leans backward with only inches of space between the two? Our feel- ing is that the Garuda did survive the fall and, with perhaps but further minimal orientation, because of its bulk was suffered to remain more or less at the point of impact. The pillar was also only crudely set up again by jamming the broken end, together with a number of its inscribed lines, into the ground at the corner of the temple. We do not know whether this column, about 15 inches square, could have supported such a massive crowning element but the base of the image, a mere o20 x 22 inches, could certainly have been easily accommodated by the wider lotus capital, the debris of which was still to be seen in the temple courtyard at the time of Sylvain Levi, Le Nipal, vol. 3, p.2. The question also arises, of course, as to whether the image could be dated to the fifth century on stylistic grounds, which Pal believes it could not, and to which the remarkable Garuda of Makhan-tol, Kathmandu (Figure 28), perhaps also bears testimony. 139 A speculation to be credited to Dr. Pal whose idea it was. 131</page><page sequence="54">larger format in Bhaktapur, there are no other extant Variha images of Licchavi period date. Certainly the Bhaktapur image is too minor to qualify for special mention as a royal donation. We cannot, of course, rule out the possibility that there may have been other Variha images now lost. A seventh-century inscription, for example, mentions an annual Variha-ydtrds1o which would suggest that the Variha avatira had a certain popularity and hence would have inspired other images. But in their absence it seems that the very grandeur of the Dhumvirihi sculpture-among the most imposing images in Nepal-is exactly what led to its special recognition and remem- brance as a royal donation six centuries after the fact. Dhumvirihi, now a farmhouse-studded, rural suburb of Kathmandu, was an important Licchavi center. It lay on the right bank of the Rudramati (Dhobi Khold) communicating with nearby H.digdti and with Deupitan, also Licchavi sites of prime importance. The excavations at Dhumvirdhi by the Department of Archeology of His Majesty's Government, whose published report is awaited, were carried out a quarter-mile from the emplacement of the Vardha image. The site comprises a vast midden of potsherds through which are scattered innumerable clay images of animals, gods, and kings, the very quantity of which attests to a dense human occupation. A Licchavi inscription is found at nearby Tunal-devi14 and important late Licchavi stone sculp- tures, one of which is published here (Figure i i), are also close at hand. Hence DhumvirSihi would have been a likely place to install an image of the obvious importance of the Vardha. Stylistically, too, the Dhumvirihi image agrees quite well with a sixth-century date. This date conforms to that formerly proposed by Dr.Palu4 but since revised by him to the seventh century.43 The upward dating is based on the general monumentality of the image which Dr. Pal feels does not harmonize with the earlier date. The upward revision also may have been influenced by the presence of the flame border on the nimbus surrounding the boar's head.I44 This flame motif, as we have said, was heretofore believed to make an appearance only at the close of the eighth century. Having observed, however, that in Nepal it was unquestionably already fully developed before the middle of the seventh century, and according to the testimony of the Bdirgemazdhi Buddha image, by the sixth century, then the flame-bordered nimbus should be no obstacle to a sixth-century date for the Variha image. As we have noted, flame-ringed cakras are common in the decoration of Licchavi period inscriptions at least as early as A.D. 593 and are first observed towards the beginning of the century, A.D. 5 32.14S We find the identical comma- shaped flame pattern of the Variha nimbus, differing only in reverse application, on the decoration of the joint inscriptions of Dhruvadeva and Jisnugupta, undated but belonging to the decade of 140 Tevdri and others, "Anantalifigegvarako gildlekha," Abhilekha-satgraha (April i96i), part I, p. 37. The Licchavi yjtra took place in the early summer, JyeStha-6ukla-ekdda6i, but the contemporary Vardha-jayanti festival, a simple commemo- rative of the "birth" of Vignu as the Boar, falls in the late summer, rIvana-iukla-caturthi. 141 Gnoli, Inscr. 5, p. 8. 142 Va.inava Iconology, p. 27. 143 As stated in conversation with the authors July 1971 and apparently the date to be used in a forthcoming book on Nepalese sculpture. 144 Although not a direct concern of our discussion, it is perhaps worthy of note that the halos of the two images in a single composition are so diverse, the one a flame-bordered, horizontal oval ring, the other, perfectly plain, solid, and verti- cally ovoid, the single common denominator being the slightly peaked terminus of each. Although the shape of the Boar's nimbus is obviously partially determined by the shape of his head, these two diverse aureoles in a single composition should perhaps caution us on placing an over-reliance on such details when dating images purely on stylistic evidence. 4s Gnoli, Inscrs. 24, p. 32, P1.

A.D. 621 to 63 I.146 This does not seem significantly far removed in time from the period of Bhaumagupta's influence, A.D. 5 5 7 to 590. Hence, considering all these things together with the knowledge that the donation of noble images was a Gupta family tradition, it seems we must attribute still one more splendid Nepalese image to them. The Variha represents the first of the monumental images-for despite its mere 45 inches it is monumental-of an amazing production culminating in the three titans generated by the will of Bhaumagupta's great grandson, Visnugupta. Moreover, and this is important, considering the proven trustworthiness of the analyzed passage of the Gopdlaraja-vamJdvali, amply demonstrated in the instance of Visnugupta's three sculptures, it seems incumbent on us to ac- cept the chronicle's word concerning the donation of the great grandfather.'47 We may surmise, then, that Bhaumagupta erected the Dharani VarIha Visnu at the time he was undisputed king, sometime between A.D. 5 67 and 590. But it is also possible that he consecrated the Vardha a few years before or after as an act of the most powerful officer of the Licchavi court.,48 The heroic Variha avatdra, in which Visnu retrieves the earth from the demon Hiranyiksa at the depths of the primordial ocean, was popular with Indian artists from the Gupta period. But in Nepal it did not achieve the popularity of two other heroic incarnations, the Trivikrama and Narasimha. With the exception of Bhaumagupta's compelling composition, images of the Boar are few indeed, and it makes only infrequent appearance in the Malla period in stone and in wood. Perhaps the therianthropic form of the Cosmic Boar was especially difficult for the artist to concep- tualize, although they handled the equally difficult Narasimha theme with confidence. It seems curious that once Bhaumagupta's sculptor had given the Boar incarnation form it was not continuously copied by succeeding generations of sculptors, particularly so since the reproduction of popular images was so characteristic of Nepalese art. Certain images--the Citigu Nrdyagna Sridhara Visnu to cite a single example-inspired almost countless copies which dot the Valley far and wide and even beyond. We have located one at Tistung, west of the Valley, and in a single old fountain at Cyisal-tol, Pitan there are no fewer than six of these Citigu Nirdyana copies plus another in a nearby street-side niche. The Dhumvirihi Variha must be counted among the truly great achievements of Nepalese artists. Although it may be quite closely compared to the slightly earlier Variha image of Deo- garh,149 the Nepali image is not a copy of this or other Indian models. The Deogarh Vardha assu- mes a stance of triumph at a heroic deed accomplished; the Dhumvirihi image still thrusts forward 146 Gnoli, Inscrs. 5 2, pp. 68-69, P1. LI; 54, pp. 71-72, P1. LIII. This is also the same flame pattern employed on the obverse of the nimbus of the Kiliyadamana Kr .a, Hanamin I)hoki. 147 The later chronicles, too, agree with the Gopilarija-vamdival! in assigning the image to Bhomigupta, "Rdjabhogamild," Ancient Nepal 8, p. 19; Bhbdivamslvali, part I, p. 82. It is altogether possible, moreover, that even the chronicle's Jivagupta was indeed a distinct person, rather than Jiei.ugupta as we suppose. Considering our scant contemporary written docu- mentation-a mere 15 I stone inscriptions to date--the absence of Jivagupta's name in them may merely reflect our ig- norance, rather than that the oral tradition of his existence is in error. s48 If there should prove to have been an earlier Bhoma, as Bdburima Acirya believes, his supposed kingship would have corresponded to the brief interim period between the last inscription of Vasantadeva, A.D. 53 2, and the first of Vama- nadeva, A.D. 538. He was already dead in A.D. 540 when the Sivalifiga was consecrated in his memory, since Adrya, "Jala'ayana Ndrdyana," Nepdili 45, pp.9-I I, conceives Bhfma and Anuparama to be one. And if it were Bhama, a person distinct from Bhauma, who actually did consecrate the Vardha image, then it would have to be assigned to the early sixth century during his time. We feel, however, that the existence of a separate Bhima is so hypothetical that we may almost certainly date the image as we have. T49 N.R. Banerjee, "New Light on the Gupta Temples at Deogarh,"Journalofthe Asiatic Society (1963), vol. 5, nos. 1-2, Pl.Vb. 133</page><page sequence="56">in his final surge from the depths. Moreover, the vision and the hands of the Nepalese artist have not only sent the primeval boar surging from the depths "like a great blue mountain,"lso but have virtually released him from the encumbering stone as well. Indeed, it is this release which helps endow the rather small Nepalese image with a force which even the colossal Udayagiri Variha, still firmly imprisoned in the solid rock surface, can hardly match.is, Unlike the Udayagiri Variha the Nepali Variha is carved almost fully in the round. Indeed, in the very limited space between the image and the shrine wall one's fingers can even discern the complete continuation of the udara- bandha and the jewelled belt around the back of the image. This is similar to the treatment of a later image, the Trivikrama relief of C5igu Ndrayana, in which the back, normally not exposed to the devotee, is also meticulously treated (Figure 23). In another way, too, perhaps Bhaumagupta's sculptor has excelled over the earlier Indian versions by depicting Visnu as the boar he momen- tarily became rather than as the god he is. At Udayagiri, at Bidami, and to a lesser extent at Deo- garh, we are shown a god in human form to which the head of a boar has been attached. At Dhumvdrahi we are given an image which is essentially a ponderous, fat-bellied beast with human or godlike touches. He is infinitely capable of uttering "a deep thundering sound [and] with eyes like the expanded lotus, tossing up with his tusks the earth." s- As Pal has so aptly remarked, "the sculptor appears to have attempted to visualize the primeval boar itself."1s5 Withal the vast beast is not without a charming touch of delicacy-almost whimsy. For his bristly hair is neatly bundled into a bun behind his ears and from it the falling strands make a delicate tracery across his massive shoulders. The large lotus, dangling from his left hand, is the Nepalese artist's inventive sub- stitute for the conch prescribed by the Vispudharmottarapurdna.s54 One lingers expectantly before this vital image hoping to witness the safe deposition of Prthvi when the great boar, freed of his burden, will delicately snuffle the lotus and dissolve from mortal view to await his next call to set things right. In surprising contrast to the Biidhainlakantha image, the Pa*upati Visnu, or even Bdlanila- kantha, the Vardha image is today much neglected. Its devotees are few and their worship spora- dic. A minor annual celebration, the Vardha-jayanti, a commemorative day such as all the Visnu avatiras enjoy at certain appointed times, is ignored.1ss Moreover, those who do worship the image rarely do so as VarSiha but as the Tintric female emanatory form, Vdrdhi. For with time Dharani Vardha has been gradually metamorphosed into Dhu.mvdrhi, one of the four Vdrdhis who each preside over a special quarter of the Valley. Each has a color and directional association, and each is endowed with a special power. The Vajravardhi of Cdpdgui', immensely popular and solicited among many other things for the welfare of livestock, is "red" and protects the west. Nilavdrdhi (blue) is near Bode village in the east, Svetavdrdhi (white) is in the south, where two villages, Thimi and Bgdighil (not Bhadgaon city) claim her shrine, and DhumvirSihi, helpful as a 1so Rao, Elements, vol. Ix, p. -131. IsI Pal, Vaisnava Iconology, pp.27-28 has also made a similar comparison. Is2 Rao, Elements, vol.

We have already seen an example of such local invention in the instance of the tumbi in the hand of Vig .u-Balarima-Ananta in the Csfigu Nirdyao.a Vi'varfipa com- position. 155ss When our research revealed that even his birthday was forgotten, our compassion for the neglected image was so pro- found that we sang " Happy Birthday to You," a novel spfja which puzzled the farmers hurrying to their early morning tasks in the surrounding fields. 134</page><page sequence="57">protectress from cholera, guards the north. The prefix Dhum- may derive from dh#mra,is6 hence smoky or grey, and thus rounding out the four-part Vrdihi color scheme. Newar farmers claim it means tiger, in Newari, dbum. More probably it is actually a corruption of the ancient name Dharani, i. e., Prthvi, or Earth personified, the rescue of whom was the object of Visnu's incarna- tion as the boar. Thus, although the image is neither grey nor female, nor certainly a tiger, the Dharani Variha at length became transformed into DhumvrSihi as it is known today. As a typical Nepalese religious phenomenon, the Dhumvdrdhi worshippers see no inconsistency that the cult object is male and iconographically wholly distinct from the boar goddess, Varlihi. Moreover, Prthvi and the supporting serpent,57 are easily transformed into her son and daughter. Actually, with the exception of the Thimi Svetavrdihi, worshipped in the form of a small metal boar's head, the other Vdrihis-at Bode, Bidigdia, and Cdpdgdiu--are worshipped in aniconic form as simple stones. But the central emblem on the shrine toranas, and on masks and images brought to the shrines on special days of worship conform to expected Vdrihi iconography. It might be noted in passing that VajravrSihi depicted on the CdpdgdUi temple torana holds among other emblems the fish, a very rare Vdrdihi representation in India or Nepal.158 XII As a closing commentary on the latent potentiality of the chronicles-even the late ones-in cultural studies of the Kathmandu Valley, it will be appropriate, if at the risk of surfeit, to adduce a final example. We have already mentioned Pratipa Malla's role as a builder, donor, and patron. In the embellishment of his palace he erected new wings and commissioned new sculptures. But it was also his habit, as we have already noted, to introduce therein old sculptures which apparently then, even as now, lay around the Valley in various states of neglect. It is an unappreciated testa- ment to the connoisseurship of this remarkable ruler, that, while he made his selections for pious reasons perhaps, he chose unerringly some of the most impressive works which the hands of his forbears had fashioned. It was at his command that two of the outstanding sculptures of all ages, the Gyinegvara Jala'ayana Ndrdyana and the K.liyadamana, were brought into the palace compound. Also at Pratdpa Malla's instance no doubt, lesser early images embellish the palace both within and without. It was he, too, who installed the immense Kdla Bhairava just outside the palace gate, which also came from Gydneivara "near the place from which he had brought the image of Jalasayana Narayana."isq Moreover, after he had "set up in the Sundara-chok an image of Narayana, in the attitude of riding on the Kala Nag after vanquishing him [Kiliyadamana]... along with him be placed an image of Garuda. Both of these images had been found in a place called Sakonha in the Sankasya-nagari. This Garuda gave much annoyance to the Raja, who in consequence removed him to a spot near the Narayana of Narayana Hiti [italics ours]."'I6o 1s6 Pal, Vair.ava Iconology, p. 5. s57 There does not seem to be a standard identification of the serpent who is variously interpreted as Adigeea, for example, Rao, Elements, vol. I, p. 141, or as the vanquished demon, Hiranyakga, Zimmer, Myths and Symbols, p. 78. iss Banerjea, Iconography, p. 5 o6. s59 Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. I46. This incident is also recorded in other chronicles, e.g., Hasrat, History, p.75; Bh.sJ- vaY.fdvalf, part 2, p. 87. 160 Wright, History, 3rd ed., p. 146. 135</page><page sequence="58">Picking up the chronicle's clue, italicized in the preceding quotation, it became apparent that the entry is quite correct, for indeed an ancient Garuda kneels before the door of the temple "near the Narayana ofNarayana Hiti" (Figure 24). As in the instance of the Pasupati Visnu, it is doubtful that minus the chronicle's guidance this important sculpture ever would have been detected. The Ndrdyana compound contains a modern-looking likhara temple surrounded by minor images of corresponding date which invite no particular scrutiny. The Garuda is easily absorbed into its anachronistic milieu from which it is no small task to distinguish it. Indeed, bemused by its masquerade of gaudy paint, caked oil, and dirt we had long since previously dismissed it as un- worthy of even a photograph. But the chronicle's entry invited a second look, and the early age became manifest.'6I Space forbids an analysis of the Garuda image and we invite the reader to make his own comparison with other early images published herewith. Collation with the well- known Garuda of Maru-tol (Figure 26), dated by its dedicatory inscription to A.D. 1689162 is also rewarding. The latter is almost certainly an enlarged copy of the earlier image and for its age a successful work in its own right. Pose, ornament, dress, hair-style, and other particulars closely follow the ancient model. But, like that of the contrast between the Rini Pokhari Visnu and the Nilakantha images, here also we notice distinct differences in the modelling and the physiogno- mical features. Compared to the Nardyana Hiti Garuda (Figure 24), the Maru-tol image displays a handiness in modelling, while the facial features are harsh and uninspired, as is expected of a copy. According to the chronicle's entry, the provenience of the Nariyana Hiti Garuda was "Sakon- ha in the Sankasya-nagari." This was an unidentified site which through other chance references in the same chronicleI63 we had been able only to localize on the Tukucd Khola, a small stream which traverses the length of Greater Kathmandu. However, the name Sikonhi survives among the Newar community to designate a region just north of Nariyana Hiti palace in the LUjimpdt suburb. The name also occurs in the appellation of a popular image of Sarasvati, the "Sikonhd Sasumriju," which is enshrined on the bank of the Tukuca. The environs of the Sarasvati shrine are littered with architectural fragments of the Licchavi period and the stream, swollen by the heavy monsoon rains at the time of our visit, itself revealed one of the earliest and most unusual Umd-Mahe'vara panels known in Nepal.164 Moreover, a few yards west of the river, the flooded rice paddies yielded a derelict shrine in which lay among other important sculptural relics, a damaged but superb early Harihara image (Figure 27). It is perhaps before this Harihara that the Ndrdyana Hiti Garuda originally made his genuflection. But the Garuda could equally have originated at the adjacent Nardyana Caur (Meadow of Nardyana), by extension also at times called SZikonhi, and which is another Licchavi site of importance. 16s Again, it is Dr.Pal to whom the authors' thanks are due and gratefully given. For without his authentication we literally could not "believe our eyes" at finding under them still another in a long chain of unknown early images. We should also remark that one of our frequent trips to study the Garuda by chance coincided with the early morningpdja being conducted for the late image within the temple. In the course of this the voluminous clothing, red and yellow tika, silver-foil eyes, gilt boots, and other adornments, like a strip-tease, one by one were removed to reveal before our incredulous eyes a superb early Caturmfrti Vignu. It is not possible to treat the image here but we have introduced it to illustrate the Catur- mfrti type of Vi?:nu image, Figure 25. 162 N. S. 81o Kdrttika, ISPP, main part, pp. 282-283. 163 Wright, History, 3rd ed., pp. 54, 59. 164 This was forthwith reported to the Department of Archeology, His Majesty's Government, who no doubt took it into protective custody. 136</page><page sequence="59">Given the age of Pratapa Malla, when every act was conditioned by Taintric magic, it is tempting to speculate that when the Garuda began to give the raja "much annoyance," priests Lambakarna and Jamana Guvdju, his well-known T5intric counsellors, cautioned him to send the image back. But as a compromise, perhaps, instead of restoring it to the desolate ruins of "Sakonhi," for which we have not yet established the Licchavi name, the Garuda was accorded a more functional role before the nearby Ndrdyana temple. XIII The evolution of the Garuda image, and particularly its role in Nepalese portraiture, while manifestly outside our reappraisal of some early sculptures, is a neglected avenue of research in Nepalese art. The two images which might begin and end such a study stand one at either end of the Kathmandu Darbar Square--in space separated by yards, in time, some thirteen-hundred years. The closing image would be the late seventeenth century Garuda of Maru-tol (Figure 26), the initial one, the magnificent Garuda of Makhan-tol (Figure 28). Unaccountably neglected, already severely damaged and embedded in the street before an empty shrine it purposely con- tinues to adore, the Makhan-tol Garuda unquestionably predates that of Cirgu Ndrdyana and is the most venerable yet known of a long Nepalese tradition in the representation of Visnu's celestial mount. In addition to sculptures of Visnu and his mount, temples and shrines were dedicated to him in his many aspects, as numerous inscriptions of the Licchavi period affirm.165 Visnu, of course, was not the only deity so honored, and Buddhist monasteries, as well as temples to other popular deities were also erected. With the single exception of a temple ruin within the Pa'upati com- pound, no temple of the Licchavi period has survived in the Kathmandu Valley. But the quantity of scattered stone architectural fragments attest both to Licchavi building activity and provide an insight into the prevailing architectural style. Close parallels with Gupta architecture, such as the temples at Deogarh and the Aihole-Pattadakal group, are obvious as we shall discuss elsewhere. But it will be of interest to introduce here two recently discovered stone reliefs which must have embellished an impressive Nepalese temple of the Licchavi period (Figures 29, 30). We are uncertain of the original provenience of the reliefs. They were recovered about two years ago, together with a horde of very late stone sculptures, in the course of renovating the police station adjacent to Haniimdn Dhoka, Kathmandu. One of the reliefs (Figure 29),"66 is of Saiva inspiration and is stylistically and thematically closely related to five other well-known reliefs dispersed in three Kathmandu sites.y67 They are also very similar to five others in situ on the temple ruin already noted within the Pa.upatinitha compound..68 The other relief (Figure 30), hitherto unpublished,I69 is probably of Vaisnava inspiration, for 16s Gnoli, Inscrs. 1, 3, 1, 20, 36,40, 54, 56, 61,79, for examples, and there are many others. 166 First published by Thipi, "Nepali mfirtikald," Ramjham VI, 3, p. 22, Fig. 17. 167 N.R.

Profound thanks are due the Inspector General of Police, Mr.Rom Bahidur Thipd, who graciously facilitated our cleaning and photographing the two remarkable reliefs. I37</page><page sequence="60">it depicts kinnaras flanking the Visnu cognizancepar excellence, the conch. It is a magnificent work and if we are to judge by it, the temple it decorated must have rivalled the Gupta temples. Indeed, the Kathmandu relief excells similar compositions on Gupta temples at Deogarh and Aihole.170 The Nepalese relief is carved in relatively low relief and the ass-eared demi-birds lean gracefully beside the ornate conch to which they bear floral offerings. The upper halves of the kinnaras are superbly modelled human male bodies. Their faintly smiling faces are each surmounted with a tiara and framed with long locks and a wide feather collar. The lower bird halves are lightly fea- thered and provided with spectacular tails, floral scrolls which exuberantly billow out with the ornate abandon of their Gupta prototypes. This paper, we feel, has clearly shown the potential as well as the validity of the Nepalese va-dvalis as a major source for research in cultural studies of the Kathmandu Valley. It also es- tablishes the importance and rewards of intensive field study, particularly of surface archeology which can be as exciting and revelatory as the more orthodox pick and shovel approach. Equally apparent should be the paper's debt to a number of interdependent disciplines--history and epigraphy, anthropology and art, Sanskrit and classical Newari- all of which must be brought to bear on Nepalese cultural studies. For this reason the paper should equally demonstrate the value of scholarly teamwork. The lone seeker, inexpertly groping among various disciplines, risks a scant harvest indeed. Combined work may garner a more significant yield, as we believe this joint paper amply demonstrates. 7o Banerjea, Iconography, PI.XVI, i; Stella Kramrisch, Art of India Through the Ages (London: The Phaidon Press, 1965), Pls. 59, 6o. 138</page></plain_text>
