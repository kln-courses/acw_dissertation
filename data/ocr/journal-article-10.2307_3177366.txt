<plain_text><page sequence="1">Viewing the Archive: Timothy O'Sullivan's Photographs for the Wheeler Survey, 1871-74 Robin E. Kelsey When Beaumont Newhall, at the urging of Ansel Adams, brought survey photography into the Museum of Modern Art, he implicitly heralded the work of Timothy H. O'Sullivan (1840-1882) as a harbinger of modernism. In the years fol- lowing the Civil War, O'Sullivan had taken photographs of the American West on two surveys supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers, one led by Clarence King and the other by Lt. George M. Wheeler. Even a glance at Ancient Ruins in the Caion de Chelle, N.M., a photograph included in the Museum of Modern Art's landmark exhibition of photogra- phy in 1937, helps to explain Newhall's enthusiasm: the picture features stark geometric relations, radical value con- trasts, instances of insistent planarity and graphic reduction, and other qualities in keeping with a modernist sensibility (Fig. 1).1 In more recent decades, the notion that O'Sullivan was an intuitive precursor has received a chilly reception in the academy, as scholars have become skeptical about claims of historical prolepsis and less interested in the notion of formal experimentation per se.2 Although this contextualist turn has soundly reminded us to pay careful attention to the actual circumstances of production and reception, the dis- tinctiveness of these photographs as pictures has never re- ceived an adequate historical account. If the modernists have suppressed the governing circumstances of O'Sullivan's prac- tice, the contextualists have suppressed his puzzling pictorial choices. Weaving together the emphases of both camps may yield a more compelling understanding not only of how O'Sullivan approached his work but also of how his work performed its instrumental and ideological functions. Focusing on photographs from the Wheeler survey, this essay considers the possibility that O'Sullivan fashioned his unusual images by inflecting pictorial conventions with values and strategies drawn from the survey visual culture in which his practice was embedded. Borrowing graphic possibilities from the work of geologists, topographers, and other survey specialists, O'Sullivan devised a specialized pictorial rhetoric to persuade viewers that the survey was securing practical gains in knowledge and that his medium could take part in this effort. In particular, his photographs conveyed assur- ances that the survey was translating the West into legible graphic materials that could facilitate resource extraction, military control, and scientific understanding. O'Sullivan, however, did not always abide strictly by the demands of this representational program. At times, he struck a skeptical note, making pictures that called into question the capacity of photography to deliver epistemological gain. The basic history of O'Sullivan's employment on the Wheeler survey is readily established from United States Army records. He and other personnel assembled in Halleck Station, Nevada, on May 9, 1871, to begin nearly seven months of travel across vast stretches of the West. He took wet-plate photographs in the field using two cameras, a full- plate camera producing a single image on a 10-by-12-inch plate, and a stereographic camera producing two 5-by-4-inch images on a 5-by-8-inch plate. The full-plate negatives and prints made from them were usually called landscape views and the stereoscopic negatives and prints stereoscopic views. Approximately one hundred full-plate negatives and sixty stereoscopic negatives from 1871 remain in the National Archives, and the original number would not have been much greater.3 Thus, O'Sullivan, under whatever guidance or instruction, undoubtedly selected his views with care. Ap- proximately one-third of the landscape views depict mining sites or towns (Fig. 2), one-third, landscape or river scenes (Fig. 3), one-sixth, military forts, and the rest, sundry sub- jects, including camp scenes, American Indians, geologic formations, and nongeologic specimens. The stereoscopic views were mostly of scenes along the Colorado River. In 1872, when Congress was slow to provide Wheeler more funds, O'Sullivan received permission to return to work for Clarence King, under whom he had already served for three field seasons.4 Then in 1873 and 1874, the photographer went back to work for Wheeler, traveling and taking pictures mainly in what is now the Four Corners region of the south- western United States. In 1873, nearly half of the stereoscopic negatives represented American Indians or their residences, and many of the full-plate views depicted the rock walls of El Morro ("Inscription Rock") or Canyon de Chelly (Fig. 1). The pictures from 1874 were heavily weighted toward views of Shoshone Falls. After the 1874 field season, O'Sullivan re- mained in the East, working for Wheeler under contract for much of the next two years. Photography as Graphic Practice A comparison between the photograph Snow Peaks, Bull Run MiningDistrict, Nevada (Fig. 2) and a topographic sketch from a survey field notebook (Fig. 4) provides an introduction to the visual affinities that link O'Sullivan's distinctive pictorial approach to the priorities and tactics of other survey special- ists. With its refined curves, flattened spaces, and featureless, tree-dotted slopes, Snow Peaks departed markedly from the prevailing American landscape conventions of the 1870s. In making it, O'Sullivan refused to provide viewers with several ingredients of the conventional formula, including a gentle recession into space, a penetrating line of sight, and one or more foreground features of special visual interest. Instead, with almost severe economy he proffered viewers an assem- blage of overlapping, starkly geometric planes. Although ref- erence to contemporaneous paintings or aesthetic theories cannot adequately explain this departure from pictorial norms, the comparison between the photograph and the topographic sketch opens up a promising approach. The qualities that distinguish Snow Peaks from conventional land- scapes of the period correspond to the graphic habits of</page><page sequence="2">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 703 " I 1.

To represent terrain, topographers routinely preferred the delineation of slopes flat to the note- book page to depictions of atmospheric or perspectival re- cession, and O'Sullivan's emphasis on the crisp planes and morphological outlines of the West suggest that he may have adopted this preference. More generally, various survey specialists, whether topographers, geologists, or botanists, sought graphic visual displays that spumed inessentials, dis- tilled information, and arranged elements for the scrutinized flatness of the page. O'Sullivan's photographs exhibited a kindred set of values. The germane evidence indicates that this visual affinity between O'Sullivan's photographs and other graphic materi- als stemmed from his extensive involvement in the survey as both process and project. He was intricately engaged in a broad array of survey operations and had manifold reasons for thinking of his practice as analogous to other modes of recording and display. From the early days of the survey, O'Sullivan's responsibil- ities in the field extended well beyond his role as photogra- pher. The expeditionary culture placed a premium on com- petence, endurance, and reliability, and personnel who demonstrated these traits received commands that exceeded their designated expertise. To cover vast areas of terrain, Wheeler had to divide his expeditionary force into multiple parties, one led by him, the others by these especially trust- ed personnel. The lieutenant immediately attributed to O'Sullivan the requisite potential for leadership: only six days out of Halleck Station in May 1871, he gave him "co-equal powers of authority" over the operations of a side party that had been exclusively entrusted to the geologist G. K. Gilbert.5 Later in the season he put O'Sullivan in charge of one of his three riverboats on the journey up the Colorado, and in subsequent years he often assigned the photographer to head small reconnaissance parties for weeks at a time. In his field orders, Wheeler explicitly extended authority and responsi- bility for the maintenance of military discipline to his desig- nated agents, and O'Sullivan evidently took up this duty without hesitation. When a hired guide abandoned the party and then returned, he was tied up, and one member of the party, the artist Alexander H. Wyant, wrote in his diary, "Just what O'Sullivan will do with the poor devil I don't know."6 In short, unlike many artists, journalists, and some photog- raphers who accompanied Western expeditions, O'Sullivan</page><page sequence="4">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 705 3 O'Sullivan, Black Canon, Colorado River, from Camp 8, Looking Above, albumen print, 1871.

The photographer William Bell, for example, who replaced O'Sullivan on the Wheeler survey for the 1872 season, had no such broad involvement. When Bell joined Wheeler, the lieutenant, as though con- scious of the extraordinary precedent that O'Sullivan had set, proclaimed that the new photographer would "perform only those duties belonging to his special avocation."7 O'Sullivan's experience as a supervisor in the field would have not only acquainted him with the survey's coordinated efforts and overall aims but also invited him to consider his practice in relation to other technical or scientific modes of apprehending the West. All specialists on the expeditions were engaged in collecting information, impressions, or spec- imens from traversed regions, and photography was, from this point of view, simply one of several modes of acquisition. We have only meager textual evidence of O'Sullivan's own understanding of his photographic practice, but that evi- dence tends to confirm that he understood survey photogra- phy as a mode of labor, one of many ways of working in the field. The main textual source is an essay entitled "Photo- graphs from the High Rockies" published in Harper's in 1869.8 The authorship of the essay is a conundrum; it is attributed in the magazine to a "John Samson," yet the essay is illustrated with engravings based on O'Sullivan's photo- graphs and evidently informed by the photographer's expe- riences on the King survey.9 The most plausible explanation is that the article was based on an interview with O'Sullivan; if that is the case, the many quotations offer evidence of how he described his practice.10 These quotations time and again interweave the terms view and work. The photographer refers Di fIe?ei 4 Louis Nell, sketch from Wheeler survey topographic field notebook, 1873.

College Park, Md., National Archives, Record Group 106-WA, no. 131, Still Pictures Division With respect to the survey process, working up a region ultimately meant collecting data, specimens, and qualitative representations to translate each locality into the pages of reports, atlases, and albums.l4 A seasoned survey veteran such as O'Sullivan would have been intimately familiar with the facts of this translation process. The collection activities of the survey were of remarkable extent and diversity. On the Wheeler survey in 1871, topog- raphers recorded measurements of distances and altitudes, a geologist jotted down observations concerning rock forma- tions and deposits, a meteorologist and his assistants regularly measured air temperature, barometric pressure, and other atmospheric conditions, specialists in geodesy took astronom- ical measurements, various personnel scoured the ground for fossils, relics, minerals, and biological specimens, and an artist, ajournalist, and the photographer O'Sullivan amassed qualitative observations and impressions.'5 The material that the survey brought back from the field fell roughly into three categories: data (quantitative transla- tions), specimens (physical retrievals), and a hybrid category of things simultaneously translated and preserved qualita- tively for future inspection. Sketches, written descriptions, and photographs were prime examples of items that be- longed to this third category.16 In general, the survey used this hybrid form when the object in the field was of qualitative interest and not portable, either because it was too large, such as an Anasazi ruin, or because it was immaterial, such as a Hopi dance.17 Every survey specialist bore modern equipment to aid in the collection process: O'Sullivan had his two cameras and a portable darkroom filled with bottles of chemicals and other gear, and his fellow specialists were similarly laden with tech- nical devices, including theodolites, gradienters, pivot levels, field and prismatic compasses, barometers, sextants, steel and linen tapes for measuring short distances, and odometers attached to vehicles for measuring longer distances.18 For the most part, the surveys of the 1860s and 1870s were not explorations of unknown terrain; rather, they were opera- tions by which previously explored areas were subjected to new levels of technical scrutiny. Thus, both Wheeler's supe- rior, Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys, chief of engineers, and Wheeler stressed that large areas of the West had not been "explored instrumentally."19 The acquisitive tenor of work in the field was pervasive. Preparing for specimen collection in 1873, Wheeler's chief surgeon and naturalist ordered a large quantity of taxidermic mixture, 144 homeopathic vials, 48 preserving cans of as- sorted sizes, 2 copper preserving tanks, 20 gallons of alcohol in cans, 1 bird-collecting chest, 2 collecting boxes, 4 mammal traps, 4 insect nets, 2 guns, 2 dissecting cases, and 288 bottles and 288 wooden boxes of assorted sizes.20 Prior to the 1874 field season, the survey purchased hundreds of hooks, dozens of sinkers, and hundreds of feet of line for the collection of specimens of fish.21 As the survey passed through large re- gions of the West, birds were shot, fish caught, and butterflies asphyxiated.22 Survey mules no doubt became progressively burdened with bottles and boxes full of preserved specimens of birds, insects, mammals, plants, fish, fossils, minerals, scraps of textiles, pottery shards, stone tools, and other re- movable items. Wheeler's annual report for the 1874 field season stated that his expedition had amassed 9,000 botanical specimens, 20,155 specimens of mammals, fish, reptiles, and insects, 1,227 specimens of birds, and 497 lots of geologic and mineralogical specimens.23 Because the scope of the collection effort necessitated cooperation among the members of the survey's technical staff who worked in the field, O'Sullivan took part in collec- tion practices outside his area of expertise. He worked closely with Gilbert on the collection of geologic specimens, and the archaeologist Frederick Putnam credited him with collecting a number of important pottery shards when the survey visited ruins in New Mexico in 1874. In a report from the field in 1873, Wheeler informed Humphreys that O'Sullivan was "en- gaged in the White Mountains... securing photographic negatives &amp; collections."24 O'Sullivan's stereographic image from 1871 of a melon cactus bears signs of his imbrication of photography and the practice of specimen collection (Fig. 5). The cactus appears near the center of the dual images, oriented to maximize the display of its features, with a hat placed beside it to provide a sense of scale. The same visual strategies informed a tiny sketch of cedars that the geologist Gilbert made in a field notebook during the same field season (Fig. 6). In making their records, both O'Sullivan and Gilbert partook of a survey mode of collection and display whereby a botanical specimen was to be featured in fullness and centrality, flanked by a familiar secondary element to enable the viewer to gauge its size. Like a specimen, the photograph of the cactus was shipped back to the survey offices, prepared, labeled,</page><page sequence="6">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 707 mounted, and preserved with other records from the expe- dition. A description of the cactus from an official list of survey stereographs affirmed its taxonomic status: "Melon- cactus (Cereus etenoides), three feet in height and sixteen inches in diameter."25 Although O'Sullivan's immersion in survey culture was certainly at its most intense in the field, it did not end after each field season when the expedition force disbanded. Dur- ing the winter months he did contract work for Wheeler in Washington, D.C., making prints from survey negatives and evidently helping with the writing of captions and legends.26 He also photographed maps and perhaps specimens.27 In sum, he was not only broadly involved in the collection stage of the survey process but also clearly acquainted with the preparation, compilation, and distribution of survey reports and other publications. Photography was deeply entwined with other modes of graphic representation in these later stages of the survey process. Surveys were fundamentally graphic productions, and the proportion of each annual budget devoted to the making of maps, illustrations, and photographs amounted to as much as half. By commissioning specialists to produce these graphic materials, the federal government became a major supporter of the American lithographic industry, and the vestiges of this production are ubiquitous in the archives, where many of Wheeler's notes are jotted down on the backs of scraps of lithographed maps.28 Initially, the survey printed only small batches of photo- graphs from the negatives made by O'Sullivan in 1871 and William Bell in 1872, but production accelerated in the early months of 1873. In January, Humphreys provided Wheeler with $250 to prepare 200 full-plate photographs and 200 stereographs (from an unknown number of negatives) for the Vienna Exposition of that year.29 Then, in February, Wheeler initiated a larger production by ordering 1,740 titled cardboard mounts for full-plate photographs and 8,700 mounts for stereographs.30 To assist in the printing and mounting of views, he obtained the services of Lewis Walker, the official photographer of the Treasury Department and a friend of O'Sullivan.31 In the fall of 1873, Walker delivered 3,527 stereographs from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons, which Wheeler started distributing inJanuary 1874.32 During the period of late 1873 and early 1874, Walker was also making sample prints from the 1873 stereoscopic and full- plate negatives as they arrived from the field, and in March 1874, another production of 5,450 stereographs from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons was completed.33 Wheeler also decided to follow King's example and compile full-plate pho- tographs into albums. Mention of binding full-plate views from the 1871 and 1872 seasons appears as early as February 1873.34 By late in that year, Wheeler had initiated the pro- duction of fifty copies of such an album, of which at least twenty-two were ultimately produced.35 Wheeler was simulta- neously planning to publish an album of views from the 1873 field season in an edition of fifty to one hundred.36 When O'Sullivan completed his field seasons and began spending the entire year in Washington, the production of photo- graphs and albums accelerated.37 On both the King and Wheeler surveys, O'Sullivan also witnessed the translation of his views into lithographs and 6 G.

He had long been familiar with the use of photography in nonpictorial graphic productions, dating back to the Civil War, when his boss Alexander Gardner and other war pho- tographers made photographs of maps, drawings, and engi- neering diagrams.38 He understood, in other words, that photography could take part in representations of terrain that involved various graphic modes and conventions, some pictorial and some not. Wheeler's gift to O'Sullivan of a valuable atlas of survey maps tends to confirm the photogra- pher's interest in the nonpictorial productions of his col- leagues.39 O'Sullivan's appropriation of the values and tactics of other survey specialists was more than a result of influence or osmosis. He had two competing and compelling motivations driving his opportunistic practice: the need to make photog- raphy a more effective survey instrument and the need to make photography a more effective means of promoting survey work. These pervasive and at times contradictory de- mands informed the salient qualities of his pictures. Strategies of Compensation The survey process was predicated on the capacity of instru- ment-bearing specialists to increase the density of significa- tion and the legibility of materials from one stage of the process to the next.40 Distillation of essential information and heightened legibility were central goals. For example, topog- raphers would record a mountain as a set of measurements, which a cartographer would later condense into a set of contour lines, enabling the ready visual apprehension of the mountain as a topographic fact. Labels and other desig- nations on the map would ensure that the contour lines successfully referred back to the mountain from which the measurements were drawn (distillation and legibility only retained value if denotation was preserved). The notions of condensing or reducing information crop up repeatedly in</page><page sequence="7">708 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 the survey archives. Wheeler emphasized the priority that his survey placed on collecting data into "a condensed form of the topographic record."41 He described the work of his cartographers as "the reduction and presentation of topog- raphy."42 This process of reduction occurred in the making not only of maps but also of diagrams, tables, and written reports. A single table, accessible at a glance, organized and condensed meteorological data collected from thousands of square miles over an entire season.43 For O'Sullivan, at least in his capacities as survey photog- rapher, participating directly in this chain of reduction was a difficult task. Although the photograph guaranteed a conti- nuity of denotation through captioning and resemblance, the extent of its capacity for increasing legibility and condensing significance was open to question, and Wheeler himself ex- pressed uncertainty about the value of photography as a tool of geographic surveying. The main problem with photography was its analog nature. Although the camera could deliver precision, it was not a quantitative precision; the camera, in short, failed to mea- sure.44 Wheeler regretted this flaw of photography and looked forward to its emendation: Should we, by the application of skilled labor and the refinement of instruments, be able to give a value to the horizontal and vertical measurements upon a photo- graphic picture, at once the subject changes and an addi- tion to positive data is gained.45 If photography could fix images onto a precisely calibrated grid, it could become a useful tool for mapping, the primary activity of the survey. Until then, it could be of use only to disciplines less reliant on mathematics. Wheeler offered this assessment: It has been considered that the professional uses of photog- raphy, as an adjunct to a survey of this character, are few, so far comparatively little good beyond that which is of general interest as expressive of the scenic features of specified areas. The material gathered from its use apply [sic] only to the departments of geology and natural history.46 Wheeler prized mathematics above all other disciplines. In his opinion, cartography was much superior to sketching, and geodesy was much superior to geology, because the former disciplines were more quantitatively precise.47 He routinely denigrated geology and natural history as "inexact" sciences,48 and because photography shared in this inexact- ness, it was not yet for him an adequate instrument for surveying the West.49 O'Sullivan employed various strategies to overcome the failure of photography to deliver quantitative precision. One has already been noted: the pictorial introduction of familiar objects (often a human figure) to provide a sense of scale. By 1873 O'Sullivan and Wheeler were evidently dissatisfied with this strategy of approximation, because the photographer began to place a yardstick in his images (Fig. 7). The yardstick allowed viewers to convert the imagistic exactitude of pho- tography into a quantitative precision. Photography was not only analog but also indiscriminate. The condensation of significance delivered by the map, the table, and the report derived in part from the capacity of these modes of presentation to eliminate much of what was, from the perspective of the scientific imagination, the irrel- evant noise that routinely flooded the visual field.50 These modes isolated relevance and offered it in a reduced and readily apprehensible form. Over the years of the survey, techniques for making such highly legible reductions im- proved. For example, in the early years of the survey, ha- churing was used to indicate the steepness of slopes on maps, whereas in later years, the more abbreviated and legible contour line was employed.51 O'Sullivan's photography, al- though it shrank vistas onto small pieces of paper, nonethe- less rather indiscriminately recorded the profuse particulars of the visual field, compromising its capacity for condensing significance. The failure of photography to distill essentials was not total; O'Sullivan's pictures eliminated visual noise in two ways that brought them into closer kinship with most of the other graphic materials generated by the survey. The first was the absence of color. The second derived from the photographer's practice of masking out the mottled skies that the special sensitivity of the wet-collodion process to blue and ultraviolet light tended to foster. Instead of superimpos- ing a sky from a separate exposure, O'Sullivan generally rendered the sky blank.52 This practice was in keeping with the survey process; for topographers or geologists, cloud formations at any given moment were transient and inciden- tal to the structure of a view. Masking out the sky could thus be understood as a way of eliminating a measure of photo- graphic noise, as a pictorial analogue, one might say, to ignoring the heights of snowdrifts in the making of topo- graphic maps. But the eradication of color and blank skies alone could not atone for the analog indiscriminateness of photography. The camera still tended toward the production of noisy clusters of qualitative, subjective, illegible, and incon- vertible stuff. For a photograph to possess the kind of condensed intel- ligibility that was closely analogous, say, to that of a map, it had to apprehend or figure that intelligibility in the view as such. In other words, if O'Sullivan wanted the surfaces of his photographs to bear legible and densely significant marks on graphically clarified surfaces, he had to envisage the West as offering such surfaces to the lens. He had to devise views that could yield a photograph of distilled clarity despite the min- imal reduction that his medium tended to obtain after the collection stage of the survey process. Many of O'Sullivan's photographs bear signs of such an effort. For example, Snow Peaks and Ancient Ruins in the Caion de Chelle tendered surfaces already oriented to the archival plane of the page (Figs. 2, 1). The photographer blunted the illusionistic space afforded by the camera, presenting a set of overlapping planes in the one photograph and a single ex- pansive plane in the other. Certain regular marks on these surfaces, trees and weathered striations, offered themselves as marks, coordinates measuring out the two-dimensional spans of the landscape. Ancient Ruins displayed on the surface of both cliff and photograph striations formally akin to those used by geologists to diagram strata beneath the surface (Fig. 8). Both photographs represented wild spaces as already organized by the disciplinary conventions of the survey, as</page><page sequence="8">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 709 7 O'Sullivan, Historic Spanish Record of the Conquest: South Side of Inscription Rock, N.M., No. 3, albumen print, 1873.

This analysis revises prevailing cri- tiques of modernist interpretations of early survey work by proposing that the pictorial values of flatness, plotting, geo- metric distillation, and sharp value contrast are not merely retrospective projections of modernist sensibility, however much modernists may have misconstrued their historical meaning. The argument here braids the contextualist cri- tique and the original modernist reception into a new inter- pretation of O'Sullivan's pictures. A photograph such as Historic Spanish Record of the Conquest (Fig. 7) did indeed offer nineteenth-century viewers a clarified reduction of the West to a flat, stark, measured surface, but this offering appealed to a sensibility quite different from that cultivated by Newhall and Adams.55 The paradigmatic surface was not the spare wall of the modernist gallery but the distilled informational display of the report or atlas page.56 Pictorial Rhetoric If O'Sullivan borrowed strategies and values from other graphic survey modes, he did so not only to compensate for photography's weaknesses but also to exploit its strengths. Given the state of technology in the 1870s, the photograph- however ingenious its maker-was unlikely to be as effective as the map, the chart, or the diagram at distilling essential information about the West for scientists, engineers, indus- trialists, and generals. But the photograph was a superior means of securing an image of the West and of the survey itself.57 One of the claims of this essay is that besides making his photography more effective as a mode of survey work, O'Sullivan's borrowings from other specialists rendered Wheeler's survey work itself more accessible and ideal as an image. Wheeler needed such images to further political aims. His survey required more than a set of field and office practices that processed materials and information; as a highly politi- cized enterprise, it also required lobbying and public rela- tions. Photography, ostensibly a machine of knowledge, served him as a machine of promotion as well.58 This would explain, among other things, why Wheeler emphasized pho- tography's role in the production of lavish albums as much as he did its role in the production of illustrations for his reports. Perhaps the most revealing document in this regard is a letter he wrote to O'Sullivan in late November 1873. Wheeler had already returned to Washington, while O'Sullivan, who had been leading a side party for nearly two months, was still lugging his equipment through the increas- ingly snowy mountain passes of Colorado.59 In the letter, Wheeler wrote: ... Lieut. Marshall reports it very cold in the mountains about Denver. In this matter of large sized photographs, I have only one desire that need be fulfilled, and that is to have 50 negatives, large size of this year sufficiently valu- able to appear in elegantly bound Albums, of which I wish to publish at once from 50 to 100. I have 15 only suitable for this purpose from the lot sent in at first from Wingate. My first impression was that you would have more diffi- culties than you think in a northward trip from Santa Fe at this late day. However, suit yourself in this matter and communicate with the ranking officer of any party whom you meet or Mr. Klett, with a view to receiving any necessary facilities, not at your hand and this shall be your authority. I would like to have views of snow scenery, but it would not be well to sacrifice to[o] much time and trouble. About the albums for this year, I am also solicitous. I have given Mrs. O'Sullivan $100x/100 and told her to apply for more if it be needed.60 This letter reveals not only the broad professional discretion O'Sullivan enjoyed in his field but also the high priority that</page><page sequence="10">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 711 10 Detail of Fig. 1 Wheeler placed on the "elegantly bound" photograph al- bums produced by the survey.61 It is remarkable that there is no mention in the letter of any scientific or topographic need for a particular subject, and that the only specific request was for a type of scenery. This suggests that although O'Sullivan's photography was bound up with other instrumental and scientific practices, it had its own peculiar functions related to its capacity to produce engaging pictures. Wheeler's need for promotion stemmed from his insecure place in both history and the national political scene. His driving ambition was to establish himself within the pantheon of great explorers, but his belatedness made this a daunting task. The great military expeditions of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and of John Charles Fremont were long past, and even with respect to the instrumental surveys of the postwar era Wheeler had arrived late. By the time he took to the field in 1871, Ferdinand V. Hayden, John Wesley Powell, and King had already spent multiple seasons mapping and exploring the area between the Sierra Nevadas and the east- ern foothills of the Rockies.62 Competition arose among all four men and the federal institutions that sponsored them. Whereas the Department of War oversaw the efforts of King and Wheeler, Hayden was supported by the Department of the Interior, and Powell received funds from the Smithsonian Institution. Moreover, common institutional sponsorship did not preclude interpersonal competition. King, for example, was very reluctant to turn over unpublished materials and maps to Wheeler for fear of having his thunder stolen.63 In Wheeler's efforts to overcome the burden of his belat- edness, he occasionally resorted to desperate, even bizarre, gambits. His stubborn insistence on navigating the Colorado River upstream was a direct consequence of the fact that Powell had already navigated it downstream. When O'Sullivan returned from El Morro with Historic Spanish Record of the Conquest (Fig. 7), Wheeler entertained the fanci- ful notion that the stray mark above the second digit of the inscribed year made it a 5 rather than a 7, a find that if confirmed would have demanded revising previous readings</page><page sequence="11">712 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 of the inscription and radically rewriting the history of the American Southwest.64 Wheeler was playing not only for the lofty stakes of histor- ical standing but also for the mundane stakes of his survey's continued existence. Prior to each field season, Humphreys forwarded to Congress a request for a specific sum to cover the following season's work without any guarantee that Con- gress would provide the full amount requested-and, indeed, it rarely did. Thus, Wheeler had to wait until each spring to ascertain what funds (if any) he had available for that sea- son's expedition, and he routinely scrambled to muster enough money to match his budget.65 Each winter his survey team disbanded, to be reassembled only if he won another round of appropriations. Wheeler lamented the fact that "no preliminary arrangements other than of a very meager char- acter can be made for the expedition of a season until action by Congress."66 Wheeler was keenly aware of governmental oversight and his need to impress certain members of the House and Senate and his superiors in the Department of War. Even before Humphreys provided him with $50,000 from a general appropriation for military surveys in 1871, members of Con- gress were keeping tabs on his activities.67 In March 1872, the United States Senate passed a resolution requesting informa- tion from the Department of War on the progress of the survey.68 By May of that year, Wheeler was entreating mem- bers of Congress directly.69 Wheeler's support became more precarious over time. The financial panic of 1873 and the Townsend hearings of the following year, wherein Congress considered the merits of consolidating all survey work under a single governmental agency, eliminated all financial cer- tainties.70 In 1874, when Congress appropriated only $30,000 of the $90,000 that Wheeler estimated that he required,71 Wheeler had to plead with Humphreys to secure funds to cover the shortfall from the War Department's general bud- get for Surveys for Military Defenses.72 When these monies proved inadequate, Wheeler sought support from the Quar- termaster Department.73 Over the years that O'Sullivan worked in the field, Wheeler received funds from several sources, but inevitably he clamored for more.74 In the effort to establish both his survey's historical stand- ing and its political viability, Wheeler enlisted the powers of photography.75 As soon as the 1871 field season ended, he began pressing selected pictures by O'Sullivan into the hands of those whose support he required.76 He and Humphreys also brought them before the eyes of the public, displaying photographs by O'Sullivan and Bell at the Vienna Exposition of 1873 and the Louisville Industrial Exposition of the same year.77 To raise funds for his photographic production, Wheeler commissioned the private firm of E. and H. T. Anthony and Company of New York to print and sell stereo- graphs from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons (he attempted to strike a similar deal with the company to sell full-plate prints, but the parties failed to come to satisfactory terms).78 In the end, the sales of stereographs were meager, and the vast majority of people who saw O'Sullivan's photographs from the survey saw them at public expositions, often as full-plate prints rather than stereographs.79 By the spring of 1874, with the economy distressed and calls for consolidating the federal surveys of the West inten- sifying, Wheeler had become desperate to obtain greater Congressional support and redoubled his efforts at produc- ing photographs to distribute within the Capitol. After much urging from Wheeler, Humphreys persuaded the secretary of war to allocate funds for a massive photographic production, and in the three-month period between November 24, 1874, and February 23, 1875, Wheeler's records indicate that his office distributed sets of twenty-five or fifty landscape photo- graphs from the 1871-73 field seasons to no fewer than (by my count) twenty-nine senators, representatives, or territorial delegates, many of whom chaired important congressional committees.8 In all their endeavors to secure political support, Wheeler and his fellow survey leaders faced a dilemma. Short of discovering rare ores, the most valuable results of the surveys consisted of maps, charts, books of observations and measure- ments, and other technical materials. To many, such materi- als were dull, arcane, or inscrutable. The pictorial arts, in- cluding photography, allowed the leaders of the surveys to glean and deliver something charismatic and accessible from their labors. But-and this was the second horn of the dilem- ma-these pictures attracted criticism as superfluous souve- nirs.81 Long before Wheeler received his charge, survey leaders had established the practice of augmenting their reports with lavish illustrations, often of dubious scientific value. Not sur- prisingly, survey leaders in their correspondence and writings tended to avoid discussing why such extensive illustration was necessary. Others, however, were not always so reticent. Prior to the Civil War, when Henry Rowe Schoolcraft set out to compile a history of Indian tribes, George Gibbs, a Harvard- educated lawyer and later explorer of the Pacific Northwest, advised him: Make your reports to each Session upon the material &amp; the tangible, and above all things have them full of plates. Congress will print them of course &amp; pay for the engraving without writhing. I should if possible give them a small taste at the commencement of the very next session,just to make their mouths water for more, as you bait round your intended fishing place while you fix your lines. One of the elementary powers at Washington, the government printer, is of course easily propitiated.... .... So long as those devils [in Congress] can count on an illustrated work every session, so long will they make the appropriation.... Your great work should be your "final Re- port"-and for this I should take as much time &amp; demand as many draughtsmen from the office as I could get.82 Gibbs's take on the political value of report illustrations was cynical but not without merit; one explorer after another did well by acting consistently with his advice. The production of survey illustrations in the 1860s and 1870s proved exceedingly expensive. When Congress appro- priated $25,000 to the Wheeler survey in 1874 for the pro- duction of its final report-only $5,000 less than it appropri- ated for his expedition that year-Wheeler complained that the amount was sufficient to cover illustration costs only, and he later received additional funds.83 Twenty-five thousand dollars in 1874 was equivalent to approximately $500,000 of</page><page sequence="12">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 713 today's dollars and represented several times the proportion of total federal outlays than the latter figure represents today. One can imagine that authorizing such a sum to illustrate a report had the potential to make Congress squirm. Many members of Congress were evidently happy to milk the public coffers to fund this ongoing pictorial production, the results of which were then returned to them to solicit their political support. But the legitimacy of this circuit was always a sensitive issue, and several politicians over the years made political hay by posturing with displeasure at the ex- travagant productions of survey illustrations and illustrated reports. In 1860, when Congress was debating a proposed appropriation for distributing duplicates of specimens in the government's scientific collections, SenatorJohn P. Hale of New Hampshire declared: I should like the country to know how much we have spent for printing pictures of bugs, reptiles, etc., that these explor- ing expeditions have brought here.... It has cost us millions of dollars to print these pictures, and now we are going to spend $10,000 to distribute them after spending millions to print pictures of them. The thing is all wrong, sir.84 In the same debate, Senator Simon Cameron, who would soon become President Lincoln's secretary of war, issued his own diatribe: I am tired of all this thing called science here. It was only the other day we made another appropriation in regard to the expedition which Captain Wilkes took out to the Pa- cific Ocean. We have paid $1,000 a volume for the book which he published. Who has ever seen that book outside of this Senate, and how many copies are there of it in this country? We have spent millions in that sort of thing for the last few years, and it is time it should be stopped.85 Cameron's rant was a bit of political grandstanding, of course, but the most pointed question within it-"Who has ever seen [Wilkes's report] outside of this Senate?"-implic- itly raised the serious and delicate issue of whether survey publications were functioning more as promotional fluff than scientific substance. Although Cameron's words have been justly cited as an example of thick-skulled resistance to the advancement of knowledge,86 there is a difference between being tired of science and being tired of "this thing called science here" (my emphasis). The fact that survey leaders had every reason to use funds from Congress to produce expensive promotional materials aimed at Congress gave them a strong incentive, at least while in the nation's capital, to call some- thing science that primarily functioned as advertising. Photography did not escape the doubts attending the costly production of survey pictures. In 1877, Representative William Piper of California railed against an appropriation for Hayden with the following outburst: I will venture to say that there is no gentleman on this floor who can point [to] one single item of advantage to the people or to the nation that has accrued from these explorations. It is true they take a great many stereoscopic views which are circulated about this House; in fact I have quite a box of them myself. They are very nice things for young gentlemen to amuse young ladies with, but I believe that is the only thing they are useful for, and I think that, in view of the depleted state of the Treasury and the vast burdens of taxation which the people have been enduring, this appropriation should be stricken out and the money applied to some purpose that will be of some benefit to the people of the country.87 Journalists occasionallyjoined the critical assault. The with- eringly satirical Capital made this claim on behalf of Hayden: The crowning achievement of his life, and the one he deserves most credit for, is the establishment of his na- tional Congressional photographic gallery on the Avenue. In this gallery are turned out the thousands of photo- graphs so lavishly distributed where they may do the most good, according to popular report.88 Other evidence suggests that these biting remarks regarding Hayden's promotional uses of photography were not unwar- ranted.89 Because survey illustrations were susceptible to the charge of being frivolous embellishments or, worse, attractive bribes directed at a cupidinous Congress, every explorer had an incentive to justify their necessity on other grounds. Lt. Ed- ward G. Beckwith, who completed the survey of the thirty- eighth parallel, went so far as to insist explicitly in his report that the illustrations were not for contemplative pleasure: "The landscape views are presented with no purpose of repre- senting the beauties of the scenery of the country, but to illus- trate its general character, and to exhibit on a small scale the character of its mountains and canones, and of its plains and valleys... ."90 According to a rationale such as this, beauty was at most an incidental quality of a picture otherwise justified. Like Beckwith and other survey leaders, Wheeler had an incentive to deliver pictorial attractions under a more legitimate guise. O'Sullivan's practice responded in manifold ways to the dilemma of using pictures purchased by Congress to lobby for expedition funding. First, his pictures tended to show members of the survey engaged in work and oblivious to the visual appeal of their surroundings. Black Caion, Colorado River, from Camp 8, Looking Above, one of his most reproduced photographs from the 1871 journey up the Colorado River (it appeared in multiple albums and was reproduced as a litho- graph for a survey report) offers an excellent example (Fig. 3). In the midst of a balanced composition, the river opens out, sweeping dramatically across the midground, a rectangle of reflected light radiating at the picture's center. While this graphic display of motion and stasis proffers itself to the viewer, the member of the expedition hunched in a boat pays it no mind: he sits with his back to the central scene and evidently writes in a notebook that rests in his lap. In all probability, the appeal of this photograph to O'Sullivan and Wheeler derived from its simultaneous insistence that the scenery deliver itself to the viewer and that the survey itself was not about that delivery but instead about the practical and productive process of translating the West to the page. It is worth noting in passing that this same negotiation may explain O'Sullivan's apparent disregard for the exquisiteness of his own pictures. The cropped bodies, uneven horizons,</page><page sequence="13">714 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 and conspicuous scratched-out plate numbers on his nega- tives all distinguish O'Sullivan's work from the fastidiously perfect products of his contemporary Carleton Watkins, leav- ing scholars puzzled as to why a photographer of such re- markable skills and sensitivity would have brooked such ap- parent defects. But these signs of carelessness suggest a practical, unfussy approach to depiction for which the deliv- ery of beauty is but a secondary effect. Both O'Sullivan and the slumped figure in the boat highlight their utilitarian disposition by conspicuously disregarding aesthetic possibili- ties. Neither blocked the viewer's access to the pictorial plen- itude of the landscape, but that plenitude came across as incidental to survey work. Two other ways in which O'Sullivan's practice responded to the promotional dilemma correspond to the (sometimes blurred) distinction between a political favor and an adver- tisement. The first is relatively simple: by borrowing tactics and values from other survey specialists, O'Sullivan gave his photographs a scientific gloss, thus rendering them, as polit- ical favors, better suited to escape the censure of whistle- blowers in the capital. Although a picture such as Snow Peaks may have had an odd, severe attraction, it did not look like a conventional landscape and, hence, not like a gratuitous perquisite. In this respect, it is notable that Hayden, and not Wheeler, bore the brunt of accusations concerning the use of photographs as promotional materials even though both men were rather shamelessly distributing them to the most powerful members of Congress. The Western views of Hay- den's photographer, William Henry Jackson, conformed more steadfastly to landscape conventions and bore fewer signs of graphic translation. The second and more subtle way that O'Sullivan's practice responded to the promotional di- lemma entailed making pictures that imagined the survey as a process. By borrowing tactics and values from his col- leagues, O'Sullivan fashioned photographs with special ca- pacities to represent the productive work of surveys generally and that of the Wheeler survey in particular.91 For example, in Black Canon (Fig. 3), as in Ancient Ruins and Snow Peaks (Figs. 1, 2), the scenery itself has seemingly begun to conform to the graphic demands of survey work. In particular, the manufactured geometries of the boat mingle evocatively with the natural shapes of the surrounding scene: the gunwales echo the curving shoreline, the mast reiterates the vertical limits of the brightly lit river surface, whose rectangular shape appears again in the covered box in the boat, and the triangle of mast, stay, and gunwale, in which the figure is inscribed, offers an emblem for the geometric fram- ing of the survey process as a whole.92 Whether these intricate coordinations of natural morphology and survey equipment were premeditated, recognized afterward, or only unconsciously assessed is impossible to say. But the delicate ways in which this photograph provided both pictorial pleasures and assurances that a more pragmatic visual order was being secured certainly accommodated the historical circumstances. We cannot reasonably draw a bright line between the scientific and the promotional in O'Sullivan's practice, but there is reason to believe that promotional concerns played a greater role in informing his work than has generally been assumed. In many instances he may have been performing science, in the sense of making a public display of it, more than seeking to further its objectives. In particular, his photographs that partook of the visual mode of specimen collection may have mimicked this mode for promotional purposes more than they adopted it to max- imize scientific knowledge. The principal evidence giving rise to this suspicion is O'Sullivan's unscientific and scant sam- pling of specimens from explored regions. Although several photographs of things as specimens appeared in survey pub- lications and exposition displays, they were not part of an extensive photographic taxonomy: O'Sullivan took only a smattering of pictures in which a botanical or geologic sub- ject appeared in this manner. From the point of view of constructing a taxonomic archive, the choice of subjects was arbitrary; one would strive in vain to discern a basis within the natural sciences for the decision to photograph the melon cactus and not the ocotillo, senita, pincushion, or cholla. It is possible, of course, that O'Sullivan was merely trying to make his medium as scientifically useful as possible within the limits of his equipment and supplies. But nowhere in the survey correspondence does Wheeler or O'Sullivan complain about not having sufficient glass plates to complete taxonomic records, and Wheeler seemed perfectly happy to continue to reproduce the same few images of cacti, trees, and rocks. The evidence suggests, in short, that O'Sullivan did not attempt to construct an archive of the species and geomorphological particulars of the West but, rather, a small number of his photographs allowed him to represent the activity of speci- men collection as if he had. By offering up photographs as collected specimens, his practice harnessed photography's persuasive realism, reliability, and sense of presence to a survey activity that in fact lay largely outside its scope. The brilliance of this strategy resided in its rhetoric of immediacy. Instead of showing the viewer specimen collec- tion in progress, as did Black Canion, photographs such as Melon Cactus put the viewer in the role of collector, enabling a vicarious participation in survey work. The photograph idealized and refined this work to the moment of capture, when the specimen appeared in full and measured display. Promoting the survey as a perfectly possessive mode of see- ing, of course, also served to promote O'Sullivan's medium. Even as these pictures idealized the survey process as a way of taking possession of the West, they affirmed the visually ac- quisitive power of photography. One could approach the photographs of self-exhibiting, marked surfaces with a similar wariness. The stark graphic qualities of photographs such as Snow Peaks and Ancient Ruins secured rhetorical values that outran their scientific utility. In Snow Peaks, for example, the path running across the snowy slope was less a helpful diagram of topographic traversal than a rhetorical depiction of the survey as a path-finding venture that could facilitate the extraction of valuable resources in remote areas. The enlistment of graphic reduction and legi- bility for rhetorical purposes in Ancient Ruins was more com- plex. The curvature of the weathered striations of the rock wall echoes that of the rope connecting the pair of figures on the upper ruins to that below. The exploratory penetration of the Euro-American into the West thus appeared in the image not only as a vigorous climb but also as an ascent associated with all the inevitability and grandeur of geologic process.</page><page sequence="14">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 715 Depicted as a page from the book of nature, the rock wall brought natural writing and the occupation of the West by Euro-Americans into utter harmony, as though the latter enjoyed the same divine sanction understood to apply to the former.3 Ancient Ruins thus merged a new technical mode of geo- logic and geographic representation with an older conflation of expansionist ambition and natural process. The figures registered as marks on a diagrammatic template (they are the same size as the anthropomorphic pictoglyph on the rock wall), but the diagram as a whole figuratively related a stock narrative of naturalized conquest. The novel distillation of the photograph as diagram reinforced a routine simplifica- tion of the politics at stake in the survey enterprise. This braiding together of codes old and new may account in part for why this photograph has remained so distinctive and compelling. The view of the cliff proffered a collision of paradigms, simultaneously invoking the sublime and its dis- ablement via technical mastery. It depicted survey work at the climax of its heroic ambition, when the mythically infinite spaces of the West were succumbing to the mensurational lengths to which that work would go. This account of the ways in which O'Sullivan's survey pho- tographs negotiated a peculiar set of historical conditions is meant to augment, and not supplant, accounts that stress the indexical assurances that gave early photography much of its special currency. These assurances would only have en- hanced the persuasive power of these pictures. Even as An- cient Ruins invoked diagrammatic and narrative codes, it also declared the presence of the survey, and O'Sullivan himself, at this rhetorically rich site. The photograph gave the survey a detachable, reproducible sign of this moment of presence, a distributable version of the fixed signature that one of the survey packers scrawled on the face of the upper ruins.94 It was, of course, in O'Sullivan's interest to promote the Wheeler survey in particular and not just survey work in general. The surveys of Hayden, Powell, and King were also collecting specimens, mapping terrain, and scaling rock walls, and the belated Wheeler needed ways to distinguish his survey from those of his peers. Unfortunately for him, the expertise of his rivals in geology, ethnography, and other domains of scientific inquiry generally surpassed his own. While he could claim to compete in the quality and scope of his cartography and geodetic work, the truly distinguishing feature of his survey was its military tenor. Although King also led expeditions for the Department of War, Wheeler was a military officer, and he alone among the leaders of the principal postwar surveys tended to keep military concerns at the forefront of his work. If the promotional hypothesis is ro- bust, then we would expect that O'Sullivan sought to make photographs laying claim to the special value of this emphasis. Indeed, many of his photographs served this distinguishing function, including Ancient Ruins. The officials for whom Wheeler needed to appeal for support would have associated this view of Canyon de Chelly with a conflict that took place there less than a decade before the picture was made. In 1863-64, Gen.James Carleton and Kit Carson drove resisting Navajos into the canyon, burning their peach orchards and threatening them with starvation. This violent suppression devastated the morale of other Navajo resisters in the region, who surrendered in great numbers.95 The photograph thus offered not simply a symbolic imprimatur to Euro-American occupation of the West generally, but also a celebration and promise of the military's role in making that occupation possible. The photograph would have reminded viewers of recent military operations and the ongoing need for an army presence (expeditionary and otherwise) in the West.96 The rhetoric of the image thus merged scientific possession (the West as diagram) with military occupation, a nexus that served to distinguish and elevate the particular mission that O'Sullivan and Wheeler served. Such more tailored promotional strategies show them- selves most clearly in O'Sullivan's photographs of American Indians. Although by the 1870s the general shift in the fine and graphic arts was toward idealized representations of American Indians as a benign and vanishing race, the moti- vations for Wheeler and his staff were not entirely consonant with this trend. The army had an incentive to celebrate the regional security already obtained by military force while insisting that safety and stability could not be taken for granted. The motivation behind this insistence was threefold. First, Wheeler's employer, the Department of War, sought to maintain its substantial presence in the West, which it could more easily do if insecurity remained a threat. Second, Wheeler's survey was specifically geared toward providing information germane to military needs, such as troop move- ment and fort placement, and so would possess an advantage over other surveys if those needs remained vital.97 Third, sending out soldiers to do survey work would presumably be more logical if the areas to be traversed still posed significant risks of strife and violence.98 One of the key issues of the 1874 congressional hearings on consolidation was whether surveys still required military escorts.99 For all these reasons, Wheeler had a special incentive to represent the West as still simmer- ing with the possibility of violent eruption. O'Sullivan's pho- tographs of American Indians negotiated this issue carefully, depicting a security achieved militarily but in need of ongo- ing maintenance. The photograph View on Apache Lake, Sierra Blanca Range, Arizona, which was often featured in survey materials and displays, exemplifies this negotiation (Fig. 11). Here, O'Sullivan made use of the visual rhetoric of collection and display to portray a West secure only by means of continued military oversight. Two Apache guides and two Euro-Ameri- cans rest on the shore of a mountain lake. O'Sullivan rhetor- ically framed the guide sitting on the rock in the lake as a collected specimen (Fig. 12). The figure squats froglike on a boulder, a collapsed pictorial depth making him appear smaller than human size. The numeral 3, which O'Sullivan scratched into the photographic plate at the compilation stage of the survey process, secured for Apache and rock the look of an exhibit (such numerical tags can be found in diagrams and displays from many survey publications). The pictorial rhetoric of collection operates in this picture within a structure of surveillance. O'Sullivan employed an unusually shallow depth of field to cabin the Apache figures in a narrow layer of optical scrutiny. The two scouts, with their conspic- uously held rifles, endure the supervision of the two Euro- American members of the expedition party, who line the</page><page sequence="15">716 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 11 O'Sullivan, View on Apache Lake, Sierra Blanca Range, Arizona: Two Apache Scouts in the Foreground, albumen print, 1873. Cambridge, Mass., Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University Art Museums, On deposit from the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Transfer from the Museum of Comparative Zoology Library, Gift of the U.S. War Department, 1877 (? 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College, photo: Allan Macintyre) right side of the image, pinning the Apache figures between them and the lake. The photograph posits an association between the Apache figures and disorder. Although many rounded boulders lay along the water's edge (one can discern this from other photographs of the lake), O'Sullivan chose as a perch for the central Apache figure a boulder with a sheer side facing the camera. Once again, in collecting impressions on his full plates, O'Sullivan skewed the translation process to favor the self-exhibiting, marked surface. The surface of this boulder, however, is exceedingly unlike the regular, aesthetically ap- pealing geologic surfaces that O'Sullivan generally selected; shattering cracks run helter-skelter across it. O'Sullivan's camera has recorded the reticular array of fractures, gouges, and chips with mesmerizing precision. The result is a care- fully obtained specimen of unintelligible nature, of garbled geologic syntax. This pictorial association between American Indians and graphic chaos would have suited a military that could prom- ise to secure order through force and supervision, and the rhetoric of Apache Lake echoes that of the Wheeler survey as a whole. Wheeler himself despised what he perceived to be the flux and chaos of much Indian life. He said of the Apaches, "The secret of their great terror to the whites is their lawless and roving life."100 He insisted that "Mountain Indians" belonged to a "wild, roving breed" and that their "lawless and migratory" ways had "carried them beyond the notion of anything like order, even among their own peo- ple."'?0 This disorder allegedly extended to the syntactic. Survey chronicler Frederick Loring reported in one of his dispatches that "Indian talk is something like baby-talk in its utter disjointedness."'02 The specific strategy of reading a rock face as an expressive corollary to the character of local Indians was implicitly en-</page><page sequence="16">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 717 12 Detail of Fig. 11 dorsed by Wheeler. In a discussion of another locale in his final report, he wrote: The eroded walls of lime and sandstone are basalt-capped, presenting every variety of contour, black, ugly, and frown- ing, with escarpments impossible of ascent or descent, except in friendly openings where the drainage of minor side ravines had cut out more gentle slopes. This region was the stronghold of the Apache-Mohaves, where they had hunted and fished for unnumbered generations, and more lately murdered to their heart's content.103 In View on Apache Lake, O'Sullivan presented the randomly cracked rock surface as if its gibberish bore some strong relation to the purported chaos and unintelligibility of the Apaches themselves. The marks on the rock face constitute a geologic analogue to the disjointed, degenerate syntax that Loring attributed to American Indian speech. The scout rests the butt of his rifle in a particularly salient gouge in the rock face, a gesture that may have reinforced the suggestion that he possessed a brutish degenerative backwardness. The clar- ity with which the numeral 3 has been scratched into the image of the stone on the photographic plate juxtaposes the violent and incoherent natural writing on the rock, associ- ated with the Apache figure, with the clear and rational notation of O'Sullivan himself. The photograph conveyed the survey's promise that through both scientific investiga- tions and military oversight it could keep the potential chaos of the region and its inhabitants at bay. Concern for promoting the distinctive emphases and ex- pertise of the Wheeler survey may help account more gener- ally for O'Sullivan's proclivity toward representing American Indian men in a state of contained servitude or idleness. Whereas Apache Lake is an example of the former, Aboriginal Life among the Navajoe Indians: Near Old Fort Defiance (Fig. 13) is an example of the latter. This photograph, ostensibly col- lecting a specimen of "aboriginal life," bears signs of industry (the woman weaving) and agriculture (the ears of corn in the tree), but also signs of idleness and danger (the disengaged, disgruntled-looking men, one of whom is armed). The latter signs crowd around and largely eclipse the former; the viewer who seeks out the working hands of the woman finds instead the nexus of a young man's bow and arrow. The camera has enforced a strict containment of the figures in a packed image and a crowded depth of field, a pictorial counterpart to the army's containment of the Navajos on reservation lands in the wake of General Carleton's campaign against resistance. The image associates a necessary containment with a tenuous security. The Torque of the Subject The argument of this essay has made three principal claims: that O'Sullivan borrowed tactics and values from the graphic modes of other survey specialists, and that he did so, on the one hand, to make photography a superior instrument of survey work and, on the other hand, to enhance his photo- graphs as promotional materials. These claims do not require</page><page sequence="17">718 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2003 VOLUME LXXXV NUMBER 4 13 O'Sullivan, Aboriginal Life among the Navajoe Indians: Near Old Fort Defiance, albumen print, 1873.

The mo- tivations thus far ascribed to his practice are objective, deriv- ing from the technical, institutional, and political determi- nants exerting themselves on it.104 This argument does not aim at closure, and two complica- tions are especially worthy of note. The first is that the photographic strategies informing O'Sullivan's practice did not remain constant over the years of the survey. As suggested at the beginning of this essay, his choice of subjects changed over the three seasons he worked for Wheeler in the field. For example, O'Sullivan took many pictures of mining oper- ations in 1871 but very few thereafter, Humphreys having evidently concluded that the emphasis on mining photo- graphs had been unwise.105 In the albums produced by the survey, the one photograph of mining (if it can be called that) repeatedly given prominence is Snow Peaks, which does not show the mine to which the caption alludes at all. Per- haps the most plausible explanation for this course of events is that Humphreys decided that promotional efforts related to mining did well to assert mining's invisibility. The 1873 field season was marked by the heavy emphasis on pictures of American Indians, and the 1874 season is notable both for the many pictures that insisted on the agricultural potential of the Southwest and for O'Sullivan's side trip to Shoshone Falls. The trip to the falls confirms that by O'Sullivan's last season in the field the promotional aspects of his practice had begun to trump its function as a means of recording places, things, and people encountered by the survey. Al- though Shoshone Falls was outside the ambit of Wheeler's expeditions in 1874, and no other specialist besides O'Sullivan made the trip, photographs of the falls appeared in the survey's albums and photographic sets. The second complication worth mentioning is that a strong case can be made that O'Sullivan's subjectivity skewed</page><page sequence="18">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 719 the objective determinants this article has identified. More specifically, there are signs that the photographer put an idiosyncratic and skeptical spin on his appropriation of vari- ous graphic tactics and values. Although O'Sullivan had many reasons to amplify the capacity of his medium to both deliver knowledge and assert that knowledge and security (and only incidentally pleasure) were being delivered by the survey, one could argue that in the process he injected his own doubts about the survey as a process. Even as he produced images in keeping with the demands of his assignment, he introduced odd indeterminacies that threatened the very capacity he had ostensibly worked so hard to obtain. Examples of such indeterminacies appear in the photo- graphs already discussed, perhaps most cleverly in Historic Spanish Record (Fig. 7). In many respects, this picture fits snugly within the survey's ideological operations: the yard- stick measured the lesser span of the Spanish inscription, associating the survey's mensurational sight with a new mo- ment of historical conquest. The image pictured the West as a conflict on a graphic surface, won by the greater scope and clarity of the survey's notations. But such an understand- ing of the image runs up against the odd fact that the numer- als of the gingerly propped yardstick lie partially obscured by the yucca plant before it. Since the key fact about the subject of the picture was the indeterminacy of the second digit of the inscribed year (a 5 or a 7), the obscured numerals of the yardstick call into question how much greater certainty the survey has secured. The numeral 18 that pops out between the interruptive leaves at the center of the image takes up a pictorial dialogue with the 18 in the inscription, establishing a visual play between measures of time and space. These pictorial quirks may have been accidental, of course, but this possibility is undercut by the care evident in the picture's construction and by the fact that O'Sullivan took another ver- sion (little known) that lacks these subtleties. Moreover, the jerry-rigged support of the yardstick seems a prolepsis of the very notion of accident in taking the measure of the image. With or without these qualifications, the argument pre- sented here raises general issues about the study of nine- teenth-century expedition photography. One issue is whether it is time to move away from the long-standing concern with locating this category of practice relative to the changing historical border between art and science. Such attempts have tended to neglect the complex visual culture of the latter and the role of rhetoric in its ongoing constitution as well as to superimpose a discourse belonging to salon reviews and amateur photographyjournals on a distant photographic domain.106 A second issue is whether the moment has come to bring more nuance and historical specificity to the inter- section of United States expeditionary practices and larger ideological operations of nationalism and Manifest Destiny. While efforts at establishing the very fact of such an intersec- tion have been necessary, scholarship in the field has at times fostered the impression that photographic practices pro- ceeded in lockstep conformity to an evolving national ideol- ogy. However much one may want to resist a resubscription to the notion of photographer as author, the practices of par- ticular expeditionary photographers were very differently sit- uated in the political fabric. Wheeler's correspondence, for example, bears many more signs of local anxiety than lofty ideals, in part because his relationship to several larger ideo- logical schemes was troublesome. For example, in the years of the Grant administration, the military found itself increas- ingly criticized and alienated, and Wheeler shared in the sense of persecution that pervaded the ranks. As a result, he was much more loyal to the United States Army than to his government at large, and any nationalist pride Wheeler felt in the unfolding of Manifest Destiny would have been miti- gated and inflected by his deep grievances in this regard.107 A third issue raised by this essay is how common it was for nineteenth-century photographers embedded in collective, instrumental enterprises to draw on the values, tactics, and graphic conventions of their fellow specialists. My own rum- maging in archives suggests that while it was unusual, O'Sullivan was not the only photographer to have borrowed in this manner. Finally, this argument raises questions about how we can best write the history of modernism in photog- raphy. One irony of the leading critiques of curatorial at- tempts to integrate survey photography into a history of modernism is that they have implicitly accepted that the pictorial values and strategies of flatness, geometric distilla- tion, and graphic signification belonged exclusively to mod- ernist practice, and hence that the apprehension of such values in early photographs could be explained only as an anachronism. This essay has marshaled evidence and argu- ment to show that we have good reason to believe that these values and strategies emerged within photography before modernist photography proper got under way. The relevant historical materials, however, suggest that this emergence derived not from an autonomous investigation of the me- dium and its limits but instead from the deep embeddedness of survey photography in an instrumental matrix of graphic disciplines.

The actual number of photographs taken by O'Sullivan in 1871 is diffi- cult to ascertain. We know that some negatives from the trip up the Colorado River broke in transit. See Wheeler to Humphreys, June 8, 1872, BL2, 40-48 (recommending that when the Grand Canyon is reached, "a small party should be detached to gather studies to replace those from a similar locality unfortunately broken in transit during the past season"). Figures given by Wheeler as to the total number of photographs taken in 1871 are not entirely reliable. In a letter to Humphreys, Wheeler claimed that by "dint of hard labor more than 400 negatives" had been obtained. Wheeler to Humphreys, Jan. 23, 1872, BL2, 4-8. But this number is likely exaggerated, as the letter in which it appears, written right on the heels of the expedition season, is full of puffery. In his Preliminary Report, Wheeler, 1872, 25, more modestly asserted that "a little less than three hundred negatives have been produced." Even this figure may be inflated. 4.

No scholar has satisfactorily explained why the essay in Harper's mentions neither O'Sullivan nor King by name, but this indirectness may have been a way of evading War Department rules regarding the publication of survey results via outside channels. 10. Although some scholars have inferred that O'Sullivan wrote the essay himself, the fact that the essay is written in the third person renders this unlikely. Popular accounts of survey work written by survey participants were commonly couched in the first person. This was true of the account King wrote of his survey for the Atlantic Monthly and the accounts that Frederick Loring and William H. Rideing wrote of the Wheeler survey for Appleton's Journal of Literature, Science and Art and Harper's, respectively. That the Samson essay quotes the unnamed photographer several times also supports the hypothesis that the writer was working from an interview. 11. Samson (as in n. 8), 467. 12. Ibid., 471. 13. Ibid. 14. Like all of the major surveys of the West, the Wheeler survey had a flexible four-stage system of processing information and materials, the first stage taking place in the field and the rest in the offices of the survey and its contractors and consultants. In the first stage, field parties combed Western regions to collect data, specimens, observations, and impressions. In the second, or preparation, stage, specialists pored over the material and infor- mation amassed and performed whatever translations and modifications were necessary to produce labeled units, such as maps, charts, photographs, and brief accounts of particular field parties, sites, or phenomena. In the third, or compilation, stage, these units were assembled into publishable wholes, such as atlases, albums, and bound reports. In the fourth, or distribution, stage, the sponsoring institution then shipped or displayed these publications to tar- geted recipients. The correspondence records of the Wheeler survey are particularly replete with letters tracking collected materials through the var- ious stages of the process. For example, after the first field season, Wheeler wrote Acting Assistant Surgeon W. J. Hoffman with these instructions: "You may now consider that all the specimens of minerals are at hand. You will continue and complete the labelling,-after which you will present at the earliest possible moment a complete mineralogical report." Wheeler to Hoff- man, May 9, 1872, Letters Sent (as in n. 4), 144. The science studies of Bruno Latour have informed my understanding of the survey as a process. See the chapter "Circulating Reference" in Latour, Pandora's Hope: Essays on the Reality of Science Studies (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1999), 24-79. 15. Wheeler et al., 1875-89, vol. 1, 660. 16. Specialists, of course, translated specimens into abstract, quantitative, or taxonomic notations. Although much of this translation was postponed until the collectors returned to the East, some took place in the field. For example, in one journal entry, Gilbert wrote that he spent "the forepart of the day at Camp 4, labelling specimens and writing notes." Entry for May 25, 1871, Geologists' Field Notebooks, Records of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, RG 57, entry 90, no. 3372, 20, National Archives. 17. These categories, of course, have inexact definitions and porous bound- aries. All detached things are, in a sense, translated or modified in the process of detachment (the specimen is moved, separated from its surroundings, perhaps dried or submerged in a chemical bath, or even, in the first instance, killed). And the third category unquestionably possesses a metaphoric cast. Nonetheless, these rubrics make sense of the practical order of the survey, which stressed the importance of information, specimens, and graphic ren- derings. 18.

The geologist may have been shooting the rabbit for food, but he almost certainly desired the eagle as a specimen. The literature on specimen collection has grown richly in recent years.

The close affinity of photographic and other specimens was asserted at the time. In delineating the activities of his survey, Wheeler occasionally listed O'Sullivan under the heading "Natural History." See, for example, Wheeler to Professor Baird, Smithsonian Institu- tion, Nov. 1873, BL2, 226-34. In a letter to Humphreys summarizing the results of the survey and following the list of specimens collected and donated to the Smithsonian, Wheeler wrote, "Several hundred photographic nega- tives ... now stored in the Washington Office." Wheeler to Humphreys, Apr. 28, 1878, WLS, vol. 5, 445. Amy Meyers has noted the partial conformity of a King Survey photograph to the "traditional specimen type." Amy R. Weinstein Meyers, "Sketches from the Wilderness: Changing Conceptions of Nature in American Natural History Illustration: 1680-1880," Ph.D. diss., Yale Univer- sity, 1985, 295. 26. Following the 1873 field season, Wheeler reported to Humphreys that O'Sullivan was "constantly employed" making proofs from his negatives. Wheeler to Humphreys, Apr. 7, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 133-35. The identity of the author or authors of the descriptive legends that Wheeler had printed to accompany the landscape views compiled into albums and sets of twenty-five in 1875-76 remains a matter of conjecture, but there is reason to believe that O'Sullivan took part in the writing. First, as has been noted, O'Sullivan often went about in the field with a small side party under his direction; hence, other prominent members of the survey, including Wheeler, may have been less qualified to describe the subjects of his photographs. Second, the descrip- tive legend for O'Sullivan's photograph of Camp Beauty, Canyon de Chelly, gives the height of the cliff walls as 1,200 feet, an estimate that Wheeler attributes to O'Sullivan in vol. 1 of Wheeler et al., 1875-89, 75. It may be that Wheeler received this estimate from O'Sullivan before writing the legends himself, or that he was unjustly blaming the deceased photographer for his</page><page sequence="20">TIMOTHY O'SULLIVAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE WHEELER SURVEY 721 own inaccurate estimate. These pieces of evidence persuaded Rick Dingus that O'Sullivan probably wrote the legends himself. Dingus, The Photographic Artifacts of Timothy O'Sullivan (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1982), 146 n. 61. Martha A. Sandweiss attributes the legends to Wheeler. Sandweiss, "Undecisive Moments: The Narrative Tradition in Western Pho- tography," in Photography in Nineteenth-Century America (Fort Worth, Tex.: Amon Carter Museum, 1991), 98-129, at 122-24. 27. In his account of the 1873 field season and the following winter and spring, Wheeler reported, "The several photographic copies of the prelimi- nary maps for office-use are printed by the photographer of the expedition." Wheeler et al., 1874, 114. See also Lockwood to Wheeler, June 2, 1875, WLS, vol. 2, 381 ("O'Sullivan has been sick in bed for four days, and maps cannot be sent to Marshall before latter part of this week"); and Wheeler to O'Sullivan, July 1, 1876, WLS, vol. 3, 296 ("You will return at once to this Office original Atlas Sheets 58, 49, 57, 65, &amp; 76 which have been in your hands since May 31st"). Either O'Sullivan or Lewis Walker probably made the office photographs of specimens for Wheeler that are now in the National Archives. 28.

Voucher no. 113, 2d quarter, 1873, enclosing letter from Office of the Chief of Engineers to Wheeler, Jan. 30, 1873, WR. This was in response to a request for printing funds from Wheeler. See Wheeler to Humphreys,Jan. 27, 1873, BL2, 79. Wheeler may also have received an additional $50 for prepar- ing photographs for the Vienna Exposition of 1873. In a separate letter Wheeler requested $50 for this purpose at the same time as he requested the $250. Wheeler to Humphreys, Jan. 27, 1873, BL2, 79. 30. Wheeler to A. M. Collins and Son, Feb. 3, 1873, BL4, 6-9. Six hundred of the full-plate mounts were for five copies each of 119 views from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons for the Vienna Exposition (this order thus indicating that Wheeler expanded on the original numbers). Ibid. In his monthly report for February 1873, Wheeler listed "[o]ne photographer, engaged in the preparation of a characteristic series of views for the Vienna Exposition." Wheeler to Humphreys, Feb. 28, 1873, BL4, 96. 31. Wheeler to Collins and Son, Mar. 1, 1873, BL4, 132-33 ("Instructions have recently been given for Mr. Walker, photographer of the Treasury Department, to print and mount a number of sets of my views and ste- reos...."). There is evidence suggesting that O'Sullivan was also employed in Washington during the spring of 1873. See Wheeler to Humphreys, Apr. 30, 1873, BL4, 262-63 (reporting that one photographer is "engaged in complet- ing the printing of photographs of the 1872 season and in preparing for the coming field work"). 32. DR, 101. 33. With respect to the sample prints from the 1873 season, see, for exam- ple, Lockwood to Walker, Oct. 21, 1873, BL2, 165. The archives offer only a sketchy history of the relation between Lewis Walker and the Wheeler survey. As this letter and other correspondence make plain, Walker was handling photographic printing duties for Wheeler in late 1873 prior to O'Sullivan's return from the field. The extent of Walker's involvement in survey matters beyond this remains unclear. O'Sullivan was never a year-round salaried employee under Wheeler. He was on payroll for time spent in the field and for short periods in the off-season, and Wheeler contracted with him for specific production projects on occasion. We also know that after O'Sullivan returned from the field in 1873, Walker continued to play a role in survey business. For example, in September 1874, Walker requested negatives from the 1873 field season to make prints, asserting that the negatives were prom- ised by O'Sullivan. Summary of Walker to Wheeler, received Sept. 24, 1874, Register and Digests of Letters Received, vol. 1, no. 915, Office of U.S. Geographical Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, RG 77, entry 366, National Archives. In November 1874, Walker evidently enjoyed access to, or was in possession of, the negatives from the 1872 field season. See Wheeler toJames R. Osgood and Co., Nov. 30, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 49-50 ("Mr. Walker photog- rapher of the Treasury Department sends you by Express one of our negatives of 1872"). As late as 1877, Walker was photographing maps for Wheeler. See Wheeler toJos. G. Hill, Treasury Department, May 3, 1877, WLS, vol. 4, 162. As Walker's involvement suggests, one should be careful not to assume that survey photographers did all the printing from their negatives. Variations in print quality, cropping, and speed of production may be attributable to a multiplicity of printers. With respect to the stereographs from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons, see DR, 115. The ledger indicates that 5,450 cards were "rec'd from Collins" in March and these "stereoscopic views" were distributed beginning in April 1874. 34. See Wheeler to Collins and Son, Feb. 19, 1873, BL4, 62-64 ("Orders have come from the War Department this morning calling for a complete bound edition of both '71 and '72 large views by 1 March"). These albums were probably intended for the Vienna Exposition. 35. Wheeler to Julius Bien and Co., Dec. 6, 1873, BL2, 258-59. The exact number of copies printed is difficult to ascertain. Wheeler's distribution record indicates that he came into possession of twenty-two copies of "1873" albums, ten bound by the congressional printer and twelve bound by the bookbinder William C. Lycett, but other copies may have gone to Humphreys or the secretary of war. DR, 100. Julius Bien was evidently to do the printing of photographs for these albums. In the letter of Dec. 6, 1873, Wheeler wrote, "The negatives will be withdrawn from Walker and sent to you as soon as practicable, and you will have the whole matter in your hands." 36. See Wheeler to O'Sullivan, Nov. 20, 1873, BL2, 222-23 (mentioning Wheeler's plan to produce "50 to 100" copies of an album of photographs from the 1873 field season "at once"). I have located no such album and do not know whether any was produced. It is possible, of course, that the "1873" album listed in the distribution records of the survey (see n. 35 above) refers to this album and not the album containing views from 1871 and 1872. I regard this possibility as unlikely for two reasons. First, while we know that the album with views from 1871 and 1872 was produced (a copy is in the National Archives), I have found no copies of the planned album of views from the 1873 field season only. Second, the correspondence files do not indicate that the plan to produce the album of 1873 views was ever carried out. I should note that in light of the practice of designating particular albums in the distribution records, the designation "1873 album" offers little guidance in resolving this matter. The album of views from 1871, 1872, and 1873, autho- rized for production by the secretary of war in 1874, is listed in the distribu- tion records under the heading "albums of 1874 series." 37. The production history is complex and some details might be helpful. The largest production efforts took place in two installments between 1874 and 1876. Between May 1874 and early 1875, the survey produced 10,000 full-plate photographs and 20,000 stereographs from the 1871, 1872, and 1873 field seasons. Wheeler to Humphreys, Dec. 12, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 478-79. Of the stereographs, 4,600 were from 1871, 7,800 from 1872, and 7,600 from 1873. Wheeler to Collins and Son, May 28, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 209. Of the full-plate views, 3,200 were from 1871, 3,000 from 1872, and 3,800 from 1873. Wheeler to Bien, June 5, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 230. The secretary of war provided the funding of $5,000 for this production on May 6, 1874. Endorse- ment by secretary of war, May 6, 1874, enclosed with letter from Henry L. Shephard and Co. to Hon. J. W. Beckwith, secretary of war, Apr. 25, 1874, CELR, 1874 box, file 808. O'Sullivan was contracted to print the views. O'Sullivan to Wheeler (and related documents), Nov. 11, 1875, CELR, 1875 box, file 2901. The bulk of the production was completed by February 1875. See Wheeler to Humphreys, Feb. 18, 1875, WLS, vol. 2, 130-31. Of the full-plate photographs, 2,500 were bound into fifty copies of an album of 50 views, and 1,500 of the full-plate views were bound into sixty copies of an album of 25 views, made specifically for distribution by the secretary of war. The remaining 6,000 full-plate prints were distributed unbound, but with mounts that provided titles. See ibid. Each set of 50 featured 16 photographs from 1871, 15 from 1872, and 19 from 1873. The copies of the album of 50 distributed by Wheeler were evidently not ready to be shipped until late 1875. The distribution record shows them being sent from Wheeler's office between October 1875 and February 1878. The recipients included the surgeon gen- eral, the secretary of the Department of Interior, Admiral James Alden, President Rutherford B. Hayes, and the Library of Congress. DR, 100. Each volume of 25 distributed by the secretary of war contained a half set of the photographs in the volume of 50. Then, betweenJanuary 1875 and May 1876, the survey produced 5,000 full-plate photographs and 50,000 stereographs from the 1871, 1872, 1873, and 1874 seasons. Wheeler to Humphreys, May 6, 1876, WLS, vol. 3, 224. The secretary of war made a second allotment of $5,000 to cover the costs of this production in January 1875. O'Sullivan was once again contracted to do the printing of views. See O'Sullivan to Wheeler (and related documents), Nov. 11, 1875, CELR, box 1875, file 2901. In later years, Wheeler erroneously recollected that the printing of views from his survey ceased in 1875. See, for example, Wheeler to Stephen Bowers, Aug. 29, 1879, WLS, vol. 6, 282. A significant portion of the full-plate photographs from this production was bound into albums of 25 views. This album contains 4 photographs from 1871 by O'Sullivan, 2 from 1872 by Bell (although the album attributes them to O'Sullivan), and 19 from 1873 and 1874 by O'Sullivan. I have been unable to determine the precise number of albums that were produced. In Wheeler's distribution record, one heading reads: "Record of the Distribution of Photograph Albums 1875. Series 25 bound with Legends by Lycett. 25 views." DR, 106. It is not clear from this heading whether the first numeral 25 refers to the number of views (in which case the latter reference to "25 views" would be redundant) or the number of copies of the album. In any event, the record lists eleven copies distributed by Wheeler. Wheeler sent copies to such luminaries as Gen. William T. Sherman, Quartermaster Gen. Montgomery Meigs, Senators P. W. Hitchcock and A. A. Sargent, W. W. Warren of the House of Representatives, the emperor of Brazil, and the president. Wheeler saved a copy for himself. Ibid. The volume given to Meigs currently belongs to the collection of the Beinecke Library at Yale. For each full-plate print in this production, a short descriptive legend was printed on a separate sheet, and in the albums each legend appeared on the page facing the photograph it described. Wheeler told Humphreys that the "legend pages are necessary to explain more fully the meaning of the views than a simple title on the face of the card can do." Wheeler to Humphreys, Jan. 24, 1876, WLS, vol. 3, 31. There is no documentation, however, to explain why Wheeler decided that supplemental text was neces- sary for the 1876 album and not for earlier albums. 38. See Keith F.

Wheeler to Humphreys, June 20, 1873, BL2, 120-22. 42. Wheeler et al., 1874, 12. 43. In 1930, confidence in this process of condensation led the director of the United States Geological Survey, George Otis Smith, to offer reams of notebooks and other papers of the Wheeler survey to the University of Utah, following this rationale: "The published report of the Wheeler Survey prob- ably presents all of the material in a form more convenient for reference than in the original notebook form." Smith to Prof. George E. Fellows of the University of Utah, Mar. 24, 1930, quoted in C. E. Dewing, "The Wheeler Survey Records: A Study in Archival Anomaly," American Archivist 27 (Apr. 1964): 219-227, at 222. 44.Joel Snyder has carefully explicated Wheeler's complaint concerning the inexactitude of photography. See Snyder, "Aesthetics and Documenta- tion: Remarks Concerning Critical Approaches to the Photographs of Timo- thy H. O'Sullivan," in Perspectives on Photography: Essays in Honor of Beaumont Newhall, ed. Peter Walch and Thomas Barrow (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1986), 125-150, at 144-46. 45. George M. Wheeler et al., Progress Report upon Geographical and Geological Explorations and Surveys West of the One Hundredth Meridian in 1872 (Washing- ton, D.C.: GPO, 1874), 11. 46. Ibid. 47. See, for example, Wheeler to Humphreys, Apr. 30, 1878, WLS, vol. 5, 401-5 (asserting that "mathematical skill" is required for mapping, and that "geological observations" themselves "attain to no mathematical accuracy"). Wheeler was proud that his survey techniques afforded greater accuracy of measurement over the years. See, for example, Wheeler et al., 1874, 10 ("The degree of accuracy of the survey was considerably in advance of that of former years"). 48. Wheeler's denigrations of these sciences had much to do with his compe- tition with civilian geologists. As he lost his lobbying battle with the geologically inclined Ferdinand V. Hayden and the ethnologically inclined John Wesley Powell, his disparagements of the "inexact" sciences gathered vitriol. 49.Joel Snyder and Alan Trachtenberg have argued over how we should interpret the passage of the Progress Report for 1872 in which Wheeler ap- praises photography as a survey instrument. My own interpretation is fairly close to that articulated by Snyder (as in n. 44). I am not sure, however, that Wheeler's criticisms of photography are quite as strong as Snyder has made them out to be. Snyder's interpretation places great stress on the sentence written by Wheeler that begins with the words "it has been considered," but this phraseology renders unclear to what extent Wheeler meant to convey his endorsement of the proposition that follows. Moreover, to suggest that pho- tography is "inexact" is not to say that photographs have no special evidentiary capacities relative to other sorts of pictures. Nonetheless, I find Trachten- berg's rejoinder to Snyder less convincing, and oddly so (because he is ordinarily quite persuasive in his discussions of survey matters). Trachtenberg has maintained that the passage in the Progress Report for 1872 constituted, in fact, Wheeler's rebuttal to those who doubted the value of photography as a survey instrument ("But, unmistakably, Wheeler means to defend the medi- um's capacity for exactitude precisely against arguments like Snyder's"). Alan Trachtenberg, "Naming the View," in ReadingAmerican Photographs (New York: Hill and Wang, 1989), 128-29. Trachtenberg's argument emphasizes Wheel- er's expressed faith that photography would one day deliver the exactitude demanded of survey instruments. Yet there is no question that Wheeler did not, at the moment of his writing, believe that photography had yet done so. And insofar as we are interested in O'Sullivan's photographs from the Wheeler survey (and not some set of future photographs), the troubling inexactness of photography on that survey, and not Wheeler's faith in some future surmounting of it, seems most to the point. In making his case, Trachtenberg also neglected the portion of the passage that is, to my mind at least, the most revealing. One sprawling, 171-word sentence of that passage begins: "I have faith that this matter [of photography's capacity for exact measurement] may be so far advanced from its present stage as to secure these features. Should this prove so or not [my emphasis], I would recommend, in connection with the continuance of the survey, that, as soon as possible, a permanent photographic outfit be attached to it...." In slicing up this sentence and delivering it in fragments (not in itself a bad strategy, given Wheeler's prolixity and ungainly syntax), Trachtenberg chose to exclude the phrase I have italicized. But this phrase, it seems to me, is crucial, because it suggests that Wheeler understood photography to be capable of fulfilling a valuable function on the survey whether it attained the exactitude demanded of other survey instruments or not. This evidence becomes ever more relevant as the present essay progresses. 50. Latour (as in n. 40), 39, has argued that the separation of signal and noise in the graphic materials of science is a politicized means by which the world is "made less confusing." 51. For a wide-ranging discussion of the issues of condensation and legibil- ity in graphic display, see Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Cheshire, Conn.: Graphics Press, 1983). On the qualities and functions of hachures versus contour lines, see Edward S. Casey, Representing Place: Landscape Painting and Maps (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002), 144-47. 52. For a more detailed account of O'Sullivan's practice of rendering skies blank, see Joel Snyder, American Frontiers: The Photographs of Timothy H. O'Sullivan, 1867-1874 (Millertown, N.Y.: Aperture, in association with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1981), 111. 53. This weakness and the efforts of early explorers and photographers of the American West to cope with it are central concerns of Martha A. Sand- weiss, Print the Legend: Photography and the American West (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002). 54. I am using iconic in the Peircean sense. See Charles Sanders Peirce, The Philosophy of Peirce: Selected Writings, ed. Justus Buchler (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1940), 104-7. 55. Ansel Adams later said of this photograph that "the unreality of this very real picture, enhanced by a marvelous tonality, suggests to me the vision of a Strand or Weston-a vision not expected in a pioneer-photographer in the rugged West of the 1870s." Adams, "Appreciation," in T. H. O'Sullivan, Photographer, by Beaumont Newhall and Nancy Newhall (Rochester, N.Y.: George Eastman House in collaboration with the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, 1966), 5. 56. The argument here builds on and departs from that offered by Krauss (as in n. 2), 133-34. It also disputes claims that the notion of the photo- graphic surface as a grid was unavailable to photographers of the West in the 1870s. See, for example, Abigail Solomon-Godeau, "Reviewing the View: Carleton E. Watkins Redux," Print Collector's Newsletter 15 (May-June 1984): 70-74, at 74 ("The concept of a photograph as a pictorial field where shapes, lights, and shadows are composed and deployed on a compositional grid, was not, in any sense, a thinkable proposition for [Carleton] Watkins or his contemporaries"). 57. In all probability, this is why Wheeler asserted that his survey needed photography despite its weaknesses as a survey instrument. See n. 49 above. 58. This hypothesis may help to explain why many of O'Sullivan's photo- graphs, as a number of scholars have noted, are quite misleading with respect to local terrain. See Dingus (as in n. 26), 31-64; andJoel Snyder, "Territorial Photography," in Landscape and Power, ed. W.J. T. Mitchell (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), 175-201, at 193-94. A promotional function can explain these distortions more readily than a scientific or reportage function can. 59. A voucher of 1873 indicates that O'Sullivan hired an Indian guide for a round-trip journey out from Fort Wingate that began in mid-September and lasted fifty-six days. Voucher no. 80, Nov. 11, 1873, 4th quarter, 1873, WR. 60. Wheeler to O'Sullivan, Nov. 20, 1873, BL2, 222-23. 61. The letter also betrays the bond of affection between Wheeler and his photographer. In the reams of pompous and cantankerous correspondence from Wheeler in the survey records, the warm and generous tone of this missive and the reference to a substantial advance of money are both extraordinary. 62. The two best histories of these surveys are William H. Goetzmann, Exploration and Empire: The Explorer and the Scientist in the Winning of the American West (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966; reprint, New York: Vintage Books, 1972); and Richard A. Bartlett, Great Surveys of the American West (Norman, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1962). Subsequent page citations to Goetzmann are to the reprint. 63. See, for example, King to Humphreys, Mar. 19, 1877, King Survey, Letters Sent to the Chief of Engineers, Mar. 28, 1867, toJan. 18, 1879, 552-53, RG 57, entry 4, National Archives ("In complying with your direction I could not help feeling that in placing the yet unpublished geological maps in the hands of Lieut. Wheeler I put myself precisely in the position of giving him my unpublished manuscripts.... the groundwork for every one of the generali- zations resulting from many years of study may be read by him at once"). 64. See Wheeler to James W. Simpson, Feb. 26, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 101 ("Should it prove that 1526 is the year the subject, from a historical point of view becomes a most interesting one"). The very fact that Wheeler could have interpreted the numeral 7 as a 5 is indicative of his desperation to make discoveries of significance. There are many such indications of the strain exerted by his ambition. Even when his survey did nothing more than en- counter some odd weather, Wheeler was quick to herald a historic event: "So far as known there has never before been recorded within one horizon at one time in different parts of the heavens, rain clouds, the moon visible in a clear sky, with thunder and lightning, hail, and snow, all recurrent within the hour." Wheeler et al., 1875-89, vol. 1, 81. 65. In 1879, Representative John Atkins observed of Wheeler's survey that "there is no law to authorize this survey and never has been such a law. An appropriation for this purpose has been made from year to year; but there is no law to authorize it." Congressional Record, 45th Cong., 3d sess., Feb. 13, 1879, 8, pt. 2: 1281. Wheeler acknowledged the year-to-year nature of his funding in many letters. See, for example, Wheeler to Oscar Heinrichs, Nov. 1, 1878, WLS, vol. 5, 289 ("all the appointments made by this office to civilians are temporary in this wise that being dependent upon apprns. annually made by congress one source of authority may entirely cut off revenue...."). This evidence contradicts assertions that the Wheeler survey received funding for all of its work in the field up front. See Snyder (as in n. 58), 191 ("both King and Wheeler were funded from the outset for the duration of their work in the field"). 66. George M. Wheeler et al., Annual Report upon the Geographical Explora- tions and Surveys West of the One Hundredth Meridian. (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1876), 79. 67. See, for example, Humphreys to the Hon. Wm. W. Stewart, U.S. Senate, Feb. 27, 1871, CELS, vol. 1, 70 (explaining the purposes of Wheeler's survey). Indeed, it is possible that Humphreys only allocated funds to Wheeler after obtaining the approval, tacit or otherwise, of certain members of Congress. 68.

See House Committee on Public Lands, Geographical and Geological Surveys West of the Mississippi, 43d Cong., 1st sess., 1874, H. Rept. 612. It is perhaps not coincidental that in the winter of 1873, with the financial markets still trembling and the need for effective lobbying to secure limited public funds dramatically increased, Wheeler obtained Humphreys's permission for an office subscription to the Congressional Record. Wheeler to Humphreys, Dec. 10, 1873, BL2, 266; Humphreys to Wheeler, Dec. 16, 1873, CELS, vol. 3, 713. 71. See Wheeler toJ. A. Graham, Apr. 21, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 158-59. 72. See Wheeler to Humphreys, July 3, 1874, WLS, vol. 1, 281-83; and Humphreys to Wheeler, July 9, 1874, CELS, vol. 4, 455-57. The general appropriation for Surveys for Military Defenses also shrank after the financial crash, causing Humphreys to urge a tightening of budgetary belts. See Hum- phreys to various subordinates, May 20, 1874, CELS, vol. 4, 305. 73. See Wheeler's account of his survey's history in Wheeler to Humphreys, Apr. 28, 1878, WLS, vol. 5, 445. Wheeler indicated that the amounts received from the Quartermaster Department amounted to over one-fifth of the survey's total expenditures. 74. For a list of these sources, see Wheeler to Humphreys, Feb. 7, 1880, WLS, vol. 7, 145. Wheeler occasionally tried Humphreys's patience with his repeated requests to expand the scope of his work. See, for example, Hum- phreys to Wheeler, July 29, 1874, CELS, vol. 4, 521-22. 75. In making this argument, I diverge from the view espoused by Snyder (as in n. 52), 41 ("O'Sullivan's photographs were never used for raising funds"). 76. In April 1872, Quartermaster General Meigs, who had a strong interest in photography, thanked Wheeler for providing him with a set of views. See record of letter from quartermaster general of Apr. 22, 1872, file 96, Register of Letters Received, 1872-76, Geographical Surveys West of the 100th Merid- ian Papers, vol. 1, New Haven, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale Collection of Western Americana. 77.

Wheeler to Humphreys, Nov. 6, 1873, BL2, 192-93. 79. Two years after Wheeler commissioned Anthony and Company to sell stereographs, only 108 dozen had been sold. Wheeler to E. and H. T. Anthony and Co., Nov. 16, 1875, WLS, vol. 4, 271. Anthony and Company evidently anticipated that sales of the Wheeler survey stereographs would be "meagre." Wheeler to E. and H. T. Anthony and Co., Nov. 6, 1873, BL2, 191-92. It should be noted that evidently, only stereographs from the 1871 and 1872 field seasons were sold to the public, so O'Sullivan's pictures from 1873 and 1874, including his famous images of Canyon de Chelly, never reached the public through direct private sale. The Vienna and Louisville expositions were but two of several to which Humphreys and Wheeler sent pictures by O'Sullivan. Exposition displays generally gave full-plate prints more promi- nence than stereographs and did not always even include the latter. For example, Humphreys and Wheeler sent sixty-six "landscape views" to the Louisville Industrial Exposition in 1873, but apparently no stereographic views. Office of the Chief of Engineers to Mr. E. A. Maginness, Supt. Louisville Ind. Exposition, Louisville, Ky.,June 11, 1873, CELS, vol. 3, 392. The forego- ing evidence flatly contradicts suggestions that O'Sullivan's pictures were known to the public primarily through private sales of stereographs. See Krauss (as in n. 2), 136. 80. DR, 145-47. 81. To some extent, other promotional materials, including texts, required the same subtle negotiation. In his dissertation on O'Sullivan and King, Richard B. Wilson has argued that Henry Adams criticized King's popular book Mountaineering"for endangering [the King survey] by showing life in the West to be something less than serious and, therefore, less worthy of Con- gressional underwriting." Wilson, "American Vision and Landscape: The Western Images of Clarence King and Timothy O'Sullivan," Ph.D. diss., University of New Mexico, 1979, 73. Scholars have elsewhere noted that in promotional efforts photographs of the American West served as substitutes for arcane scientific materials and reports. See, for example, Stephen F. Mills, The American Landscape (Edinburgh: Keele University Press, 1997), 68 (argu- ing that William Henry Jackson's Yellowstone Scenic Wonders was "sent to all congressmen as part of the lobbying for its national park status precisely because this was a format that could make scientific research accessible to the public... ."). 82.

To some, the equation between esteemed pictures and advertising may seem degrading to the former, but pictures are always selling something, and much of the brilliance and value of a picture may be in its pitch. O'Sullivan, trained by the masterful promoter Mathew Brady, would have understood this formula quite well, and his work on the Wheeler survey suggests that he ingeniously negotiated the political pressures confronting his practice. 92. Triangulation was the key to accurate mapping, and O'Sullivan would have become acquainted with the technique on the King survey, if not before. See Goetzmann (as in n. 62), 439. 93. According to Wyant (as in n. 6), 266, John W. Conway, O'Sullivan, and George Keasby ascended to the upper ruins. A stereograph of the same subject includes the same figures on the upper ruins, but none below. 94. J. W. Conway left his name and the date "Sept 24 1873" scrawled in great letters across the central white wall of the ruins, where thousands of tourists still see it every season. 95. For a history of this conflict, see L. R. Bailey, The Long Walk: A History of the Navajo Wars, 1846-1868 (Los Angeles: Westernlore Press, 1964). 96. Historians have recognized the connection between Wheeler's work and military operations in the region. According to Goetzmann (as in n. 62), 468, Wheeler was "in a position to provide something vitally needed by Lt. Col. George M. Crook's command, accurate geographical maps of the rugged Apache and Paiute country." For his part, Crook lent assistance to Wheeler's expeditionary force. See Wheeler et al., 1872, 13. 97. See, for example, Wheeler to Humphreys, June 30, 1877, WLS, vol. 4, 190-91 ("The best means of direct communication between Posts in the several Military Departments, covering the entire frontier, often remains a subject of doubt and the systematic prosecution of a topographical Survey lends year by year information to those various Departments, whereby the facility of their operations, whether those ordinarily necessary, or against the hostile Indians, or others, is enhanced"). 98. Humphreys wrote that the survey parties under his supervision were "essentially military in their organization and... nearly always accompanied by troops." Humphreys toJas. H. Garfield, Feb. 5, 1873, CELS, vol. 3, 69-73. 99. See, for example, House Committee on Public Lands (as in n. 70), 43. 100. Wheeler et al., 1872, 28. 101. Ibid., 27. 102. Frederick W. Loring, "A Council of War," Appleton's Journal of Literature, Science and Art, Aug. 12, 1871, 182-83, at 182. 103. Wheeler et al., 1875-89, vol. 1, 45. 104. The earlier discussion of the quotations in "Photographs from the High Rockies" (Samson [as in n. 8]) makes such a subsidiary claim, but it is not essential to the argument. 105. Wheeler assured the chief of engineers that during the 1872 season, photography in the field "will be more particularly confined to representa- tions for geological purposes, until the edges of the mesa leading to the Grand Canion are reached, when a small party should be detached to gather studies to replace those from a similar locality unfortunately broken in transit during the past season." Wheeler to Humphreys, June 8, 1872, BL2, 40-48. 106. The exaggeration of this discourse has undoubtedly stemmed in part from its relevance (or alleged relevance) to contemporary concerns regarding the place of photography within the institutional frameworks of museums and universities. 107. In later years, Wheeler cultivated contacts in Europe, doubtless in part due to bitter feelings about the course of his career and the erosion of his congressional support.</page></plain_text>
