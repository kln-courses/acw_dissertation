<plain_text><page sequence="1">Digging deeper: the results of the first season of activities of the AFSM on the Mahram Bilqîs, Märib William D. Glanzman The joint expedition and the activities of the AFSM The General Organization for Antiquities, Museums and Manuscripts (GOAMM), the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Sancã5 (DAI), and the American Foundation for the Study of Man (AFSM) entered into an agreement this past year to begin a joint expedition of excavation and research at the famous Sabaean sanctuary, the Mahram Bilqîs, in Mãrib. The AFSM postponed its first field season in the joint expedition unavoidably in April of 1997. Since December of 1996, however, the AFSM's team of specialists have been very active in many aspects of pre-field archival research, to develop an appropriate field strategy towards a re-examination of the Peristyle Entry Hall, and to plan for the excavation and restoration goals for the Oval Precinct and its related architecture. We have examined many archival photographs from the original expedition. We have converted the plan of the sanctuary, as prepared by the AFSM, to electronic data enhanced by computer, and we have plotted the distribution of artefacts recovered from within the excavated areas. As a result we have found many important relationships that previously escaped notice, or were not discussed in detail. This short progress note highlights some of our results. Previous research and the AFSM As a result of the explorations of Arnaud in 1843 and Halévy in 1870 the sanctuary site of the Mahram Bilqîs became a focus for further research. The first explorer to describe the site in detail was Eduard Glaser who, in 1888, not only recorded four important monumental inscriptions along the south and east portions of the Oval Wall but also managed to provide the first detailed description of the physical appearance of the structure (Müller &amp; Rhodokanakis 1913: 43-46, 137-139). Nazih al- cAzm apparently took the first photographs of the structure in 1943 (Fakhry 1952: 27). In 1947 the Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry visited the site and augmented Glaser's important work with additional descriptive comments, copied more inscriptions, and took more photographs. He also noted the unfortunate demolition of various structures of archaeological importance, especially the Mahram Bilqîs, to construct the modern government buildings nearby (Fakhry 1952: 88, 89; 1951: pis 38, 39).1 In April of 1951 several members of the AFSM's Second Arabian Expedition in the Wâdï Bayhän were with Wendell Phillips when he returned via Märib with permission from Imam Ahmed to excavate within a 25 km radius of the ancient city of Mãrib. They took some photographs at that time, prior to the arrival of the excavation team that conducted the Third Arabian Expedition of the AFSM. That expedition began with initial preparations on 7 June, under Mr. Robert Carmean. On 3 November, Father Albert Jamme, the project's epigraphist, assumed leadership of the clearance Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies 28 ( 1 998) 89</page><page sequence="2">WILLIAM D. GLANZMAN operations around the exterior of the Oval Precinct's wall, focusing his attention on exposing inscriptions along its northern and western portions, roughly opposite the stated locations of two of Glaser's inscriptions. Jamme succeeded in exposing the now famous eight mural inscriptions (Ja 550-557) before the arrival of the Chief Archaeologist (Jamme 1952: 292-3; 1953: 133, n.l). F.P. Albright assumed that role for the Third Arabian Expedition on 16 December 1951 (Albright 1952: 26, n.l, 33-34). Excavation activities began inside the Peristyle Hall. The Third Arabian Expedition was well under way until a series of difficulties in recording inscriptions created a situation in which Jamme was able to conduct epigraphic work only at a much reduced level, and then was prohibited from continuing his research between 13 January and 8 February 1952 (Jamme 1952: 293). In the final days before the expedition was forced to cease, all the team members had arrived, including the architect, John Henry Scarff, and two archaeologists. They compiled a sketch plan of the exposed portions of the sanctuary, and had time to investigate the South Tombs just days before the project came to an untimely end. Work ceased completely on 12 February 1952, without being able to complete the excavation and recording efforts. The team managed to take only a few small latex squeezes, an incomplete photographic record, the architect's drawings, and the excavator's field book as they fled (Phillips 1955: 192-328; Jamme 1952: 305; Albright 1952: 25; 1958a: 269; 1958b: 215). As a result, only the principal investigators published four preliminary reports of the expedition (Jamme 1952; 1953; 1959; Albright 1952), a final report on the excavation (Albright 1958a; 1958b) and one final volume documenting some of the inscriptions encountered (Jamme 1962). In total, the team had recorded over 161 artefacts and over 317 complete and fragmentary inscriptions from the excavation. These latter form the backbone of history for South Arabia and the Sabaeans in particular.2 For forty-five years since that time no expedition has conducted research on the site, although soon after the AFSM expedition fled Mãrib the Imam permitted other foreigners to visit it and photograph its remains (Pirenne 1969a: 299, n.5); the site and the region of Mãrib have become a major tourist destination and focus for archaeological research (Van Beek 1997: 417). The DAI secured the archaeological concession for the region around the ancient city and beyond the sanctuary, and has been active in archaeological and epigraphic research in the region since 1971. Its work has produced seven volumes of reports invaluable to the reconstruction of the Sabaean kingdom, and the results of the excavation of the nearby Temple Barman are nearing completion. Recently, looting activities in the area between the South Tombs and the Oval Precinct Wall have produced artefacts of a funerary nature, in part prompting the idea of a joint expedition between the DAI and the AFSM. In March- April 1997 the DAI completed its first field season of excavation as part of the joint expedition, to the south-west of the Oval Precinct Wall, where recent looting has occurred. Physical layout and site condition The sanctuary is now known to have comprised several architectural complexes (Fig. 1): the Oval Precinct Wall, on the exterior of which are at least eleven monumental inscriptions, enclosing most of the large, open-air Oval Precinct; the Peristyle Entry Hall, with its 32 pillars surrounding a large courtyard and its entrance leading into the Oval Precinct; an Annex positioned along the north-east flank of the Peristyle Hall and parallel to the eight famous monolithic pillars; a Mausoleum adjacent to the south-east exterior of the Oval Wall; and the South Tombs, located approximately 100 m south-west of the Oval Precinct Wall. The condition of the site as encountered by the AFSM in 1951 can be seen in some of the archival photographs of the sanctuary. The Oval Precinct Wall was fairly well preserved along its south-west flank (Fig. 2), unlike its present condition (see Jung 1988: pl. VII a). Here eight courses are extant above the height of the course carrying inscription Ja 551, just above Wendell Phillips' head.3 The team excavated a sondage along the 'south side' of the Oval Precinct Wall, where the lee side of the prevailing winds had not deposited a vast accumulation of soil, to examine the foundations of the wall (Albright 1958b: 217-218, pl. 156). This sondage reached a depth of about 5.40 m below the soil level then extant, based on the drawing and the 90</page><page sequence="3">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQÏS, MÄRIB FIGURE 1.

Note the North arrow. stated average height of the stone courses as 30 cm (Albright 1958b: 217).4 The precise location of the sondage has never been stated or shown. Albright (1958b: 217) places it as 'slightly to the west1 of Glaser 485, which is Jamme's inscription Ja 551 (Jamme 1962: 15, 399). Comparison to the published photographs of this zone (Albright 1958b: pl. 155) and to Jamme's partial plan showing the location of the mural inscriptions Ja 550-557 (Jamme 1962: pl. C, fig. 1), demonstrates that its position is nearly opposite, or west-south-west, of the Peristyle Hall, almost in alignment with the hall's doorway leading into the Oval Precinct (see fig. I).5 The top of the Oval Wall everywhere exhibits signs of demolition, and possibly subsequent tumble and decay of its inner fill materials (Fig. 3), as Albright (1958: 217) noted (see also Fakhry 1951: pl. 34, a). The relatively flat area framed by the famous eight tall pillars and the termini of the Oval Precinct Wall was reckoned as the entrance into the Oval Precinct before excavation (Albright 1958: 222). The tops of four pillars standing along the south-west flank of the Peristyle Hall are just visible protruding through the sand. While Fakhry depicts three pillars in his plans of the sanctuary, one of his photographs appears to reveal these four pillars (1952: figs 38, 39; 1951: pl. 34a). Jamme eventually assigned numbers to the Pillars inside the Peristyle Hall (Fig. 4), in order to provide approximate locations for groups of standing and re- 91</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM D.

Pillars SE1-SE5 and SW1-SW5 are both along the south-west flank of the hall, separated by the doorway into the Oval Precinct. The four pillars visible before excavation began thus seem to be SE3-SE5 and El, those closest to the south corner of the hall. Previous excavation results In order to understand the results of an excavation, one must first understand how it was conducted and recorded. It is useful to recall that the excavation occurred just before the impact of stratigraphie excavation methodology, as introduced into the Middle East by Kathleen Kenyon. Beginning in December 1951, Albright thus conducted and recorded the details of the excavation in a manner common elsewhere in the Middle East at that time. The archival photographs of the Peristyle Hall Area (Fig. 5) reveal that the progress of excavation was as follows. Exposure of the entrance into the Oval Precinct was the initial objective. A base-line, parallel to the line formed by the eight monolithic pillars, was put in place about 3.0 m inside the Oval Precinct proper (Fig. 6). The space between it and Pillars SE3-SE5 was first cleared, until the excavator discerned the south-west wall of the Peristyle Hall and the tops of several more pillars, forming part of the ambulatory of the hall (see Albright 1958b: pis 163, 164). Excavation then began by removing more soil in the courtyard area from the base-line toward the eight tall pillars in the north-east, in graduated steps, while clearance of the ambulatory occurred at a quicker pace (Fig. 7). Vertical slices were made into the area of the Peristyle Hall down to the level of various paved features: the hall's courtyard, composed of cement and pavement stones - which slopes down about 10 cm from south-west to north- east (Albright 1958b: 227) - and its various platforms; the ambulatory of the hall and its various platforms; the courtyard in the Annex, which is about 30 cm lower than the hall's courtyard (Albright 1958b: 231); and finally up to the various floor levels in the rooms of the Annex, which varied between 40 cm to over 1 .20 m above the floor of its courtyard (Albright 1958b: 232-3). Virtually no floor level of these architectural components was at the same elevation as another. The narrow entrance at the south corner of the Annex was at the greatest height of all floor-related features, indicating that the ground level to which it gave access can be estimated 92</page><page sequence="5">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQÏS, MÄRIB FIGURE 3.

The excavator was unable to investigate the nature of what lay beyond that entrance. Soil debris was initially removed by teams of oxen scraping it into the Oval Precinct and over its wall, where it was removed mechanically early on during the excavation; later, it was removed primarily with teams of oxen (Albright 1958b: 217, 221, pis 155, 161). Those teams scraped soil up and out of the Peristyle Hall, out to the north and east, beyond the eight tall pillars. Several piles of masonry debris accumulated to either side of the Peristyle Hall (Fig. 8) (Albright 1958b: pis 161, 168, 170, 174, 175, 180), where they can still be seen. Comparison with the photographs showing the terrain encountered in the initial visit of April 1951 (see Figs 3, 5) demonstrates that these piles were generated by the AFSM excavation, not by ancient and modern demolition activities, and thus represent a rich source of masonry debris whose study will be useful for the ultimate reconstruction of the interior of the Peristyle Hall. In this approach to excavation, the depth of each artefact encountered was recorded in metres above its respective paved feature or floor level. An alphanumeric grid system was superimposed over the excavation area, and each object was thus recorded in three-dimensional space. A few objects were found in situ, yet the majority were found scattered throughout the wind-blown sand and debris filling the hall. Closer to the floor levels, however, the frequency of objects increased dramatically. These objects include capital fragments, fragments of bronze plaques, stone altars, a large number of crudely made terra cotta statuettes of seated women, inscribed stones and their fragments, and a few potsherds (Albright 1952: 28, 34, 36). The Peristyle Hall was cleared completely of its debris. Its plan is in the shape of a truncated rectangle oriented north-west to south-east (Fig. 4). The termini of the Oval Precinct Wall abut its west and south corners (Albright 1952: 28, 33; 1958b: 222-3). Its walls have headers and stretchers in the manner of a casemate, similar to the construction technique used in the Oval Precinct Wall (Albright 1958b: 218, 223). Some of the headers are visible above the flat sides flanking the 'false windows' on the hall's interior (Fig. 8). In its extant state the hall 93</page><page sequence="6">WILLIAM D. GLANZMAN FIGURE 4. Plan of the Peristyle Hall showing the major features exposed by the AFSM between December 1951 and 12 February 1952, based on published data. Note the North arrow. seems to be a late addition to the sanctuary, perhaps replacing an earlier entrance (Albright 1958b: 230- i). Several very late constructions found in the Peristyle Hall do not seem to relate to a religious function of this space. For example, Albright (1958b: 229, 230) reported on a wall of 'slovenly construction', which Jamme noted was built against Pillar W2 and the peristyle's inner wall face (1962: 151, 255, n. 2). That wall is present in a previously unpublished view of the west corner (Fig. 9). The wall forms an abutment with both features; curiously, it withstood the collapse, during excavation, of Pillars Wl-6 along the north-west flank of the hall. The wall is constructed of several re-used masonry fragments, including the inscribed block Ja 649 (MaMB 223) and a capital with decorative moulding (Jamme 1962: pl. 15, bottom right). In his preliminary report Albright noted that capitals such as these were re-used in the construction of the south side of the Oval Precinct Wall and as part of the cross-walls in its casemate construction, and, 'they were found as building stone in the walls of later Himyarite reconstructions and as bases for inscribed stones set up in the court' (1952: 28-29). Albright illustrated the latter (1952: figs 2, 3a, b; 1958b: pis 158, 177), including the one underneath inscribed block Ja 561 (see Jamme 1959: 8; 1962: 256). In the final report Albright provided no further discussion of other 'slovenly construction' walls. This wall, however, was built upon about 20 to 40 cm of wind-blown sand (1958b: 229). It must have been built at a time when wind- blown sand had accumulated within the sanctuary. The wind patterns seen today in the Peristyle Hall show that the greatest depth of accumulation is always where the wind-borne debris eddies alongside the walls, as along the north-west flank of the hall. The floor level of the courtyard may thus have had less than 40 cm of sand accumulation before the 'slovenly construction' wall was built. One might even allow for a little subsidence under this wall, due to the weight of its masonry, so the soil accumulation beneath it could have been nearer 40 cm, or more, at the time of its construction. This construction method is also found at the south end of the long row of 19 standing inscribed blocks (Fig. 10), called Group С by Jamme. This group occupies the south-east flank of the Hall, adjacent to Pillars E1-E7 (Jamme 1962: 256). The wall abuts Ja 606 (MaMB 278) of that row and extends towards, and almost touches, Pillar SE5. The wall is composed of various re-used masonry blocks and fragments, including a capital with decorative moulding, and rests partly on a large inscribed block lying at an angle on its side.7 This stone seems to rest upon a layer of soil near Pillar SE5. The wall appears to have been removed before photographs of the ensemble of Group С stones were taken (see Albright 1958b: pl. 174). Traces of other 'slovenly construction' walls are found in the archival photos, including one blocking the northern-most doorway of the tripartite main entrance leading into the Peristyle Hall. The importance of these observations is two-fold. First, several walls were constructed at a late phase of use of the sanctuary, as indicated by their masonry 94</page><page sequence="7">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQlS, MÄRIB FIGURE 5. Detail view, to SE, of the entrance into the Oval Precinct, April 1951. Arrows point to the tops of four pillars in the S corner of the Peristyle Hall, and to collapse and demolition debris along the Oval Precinct Wall.

These walls, composed of re-used masonry, altered the internal arrangement and access into hall and into the area of the ambulatory. The second important feature is the foundation upon which they were built: sand accumulation. Albright stated that there was no stratigraphy present within the Peristyle Hall (1952: 36). The sand accumulation beneath the 'slovenly construction1 adjacent to Pillar W2 demonstrates that some stratigraphy was indeed present. Albright was unable to trace such deposition due to the excavation methodology employed at that time. The locations and depths of the artefacts as recorded in the published catalogue (Albright 1958a) show that none of those objects were in situ, and that they first concentrate either near their floor levels or within about 50 cm above them. Thus, the artefacts cluster at about the same depth above floor level as the lowest course of the 'slovenly construction' walls. It seems more than coincidence that such a relationship exists. We hypothesize that these events are roughly contemporaneous: a different use of the Peristyle Hall, witnessed by 'slovenly construction' walls, and the disturbance of the easily movable objects. If true, these activities would post-date the original emplacement of the latest cult-related inscription, and would therefore reflect a secular use of the structure. Recorded artefacts and computerized data There are no published accounts describing the rationale for, or the implementation of, the two object registration systems used by the Third Arabian Expedition. Each of the inscribed artefacts encountered in the original AFSM excavation was assigned a sequential number prefixed by the following siglum: 'MaMB', which stands for 'Mâreb, Mahram Bilqïs' (Jamme 1952: 297; 1962: 399-402). At least 317 complete or fragmentary inscribed objects were assigned numbers. This numbering system should refer to the order in which the inscribed objects were encountered during the excavations, or at least to the order in which they were recorded. That relationship is important to 95</page><page sequence="8">WILLIAM D. GLANZMAN FIGURE 6. Initial excavation along the base-line placed inside the Oval Precinct, view to the W.

Jamme later assigned his own siglum, 'Ja' followed by a number, ordering the inscriptions according to location, categories of content and by material; of the 306 numbers assigned, at least 289 represent inscribed objects. Objects Ja 550-7, Ja 611, Ja 624, Ja 675, Ja 762, Ja 826-8 and Ja 839-47 represent the first 26 inscribed objects assigned MaMB-numbers (Jamme 1962: 123, 248-51, 401). Of these, Ja 839-47 were found exposed on the surface around the sanctuary. The first inscription recorded, MaMB 1 (Ja 839), was found within the area of the Peristyle Hall, while MaMB 7 (Ja 840) was found about 20 m north of it. Their registration numbers indicate they were recorded while Jamme was working on Ja 550-7; he recorded the latter as MaMB 2-6 and 8-12. He numbered the remaining objects sequentially, beginning with MaMB 13. Several contexts are important, all presumably from the surface of the site: MaMB 16 was found within the Oval Precinct (Ja 843) and MaMB 25 in a wall to the east (Ja 847), while MaMB 13 (Ja 841), 14 (Ja 842), 19 (Ja 844), 23 (Ja 845), 24 (Ja 846) and 26 (Ja 624) were found at various distances north or north-east of the eight tall pillars. Given that Jamme had already cleared and was recording Ja 557 on the Oval Precinct Wall when Albright arrived, it seems likely that Ja 839- 847 were documented by Jamme after that event. Since Jamme did not publish any other distance data for the remaining inscribed objects, it seems likely that most of the remaining objects were recovered from the excavation proper. The published catalogue contains over 161 artefacts, and at least 107 of these were recovered from within the Peristyle Hall alone. The remainder came mostly from the Mausoleum, the sondage, the South Tombs, and from the surface of the site, while several were found around the city of Märib (Albright 1958a). Most of these objects are not 96</page><page sequence="9">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQÏS, MÃRIB FIGURE 7.

Eight standing stones ofJamme's Group A are in front of Pillars W1-W3. From left to right they are: Ja 629 (leaning to left), Ja 561 bis, Ja 601, Ja 641 and Ja 610 setting upon Ja 604, Ja 602 and the left part of Ja 627.

Albright grouped the objects according to material, the general type of object and its provenance. His system thus represents a post-recovery registration catalogue whose numbers are analogous to Jamme's inscription numbers: the objects were grouped by some criteria before assigning the identification label by which they would be referred to in publications. No information is yet available as to the original field designations of the objects lacking inscriptions. Although Jamme published a few inscribed artefacts that are not masonry blocks or plaques, there are very few correlations with Albright's object catalogue. For the Peristyle Hall the exceptions are the two famous inscribed statuettes listed in Albright's catalogue as Nos. 11 and 12 (1958a: 269- 71, pis 197-200); these are Ja 400, the statue of Macadikarib, and Ja 401, a smaller piece, which is one of an original pair (Jamme 1986: 61-8, 75-8). In addition, Jamme noted the location of several inscribed objects, although Albright did not include them in his catalogue: Ja 831 (MaMB 147), from grid-square E-8 (1962: 245); Ja 832 (MaMB 302), from grid-square H-J-10 (1962: 245); Ja 748 (MaMB 272), from grid-square O-8 (1962: 220); and Ja 759 (MaMB 305), from grid-square 0-18 (1962: 228).8 Object Ja 748 was in the ambulatory, where excavation seems to have proceeded at a faster pace than in the courtyard. For these objects, then, we find that their MaMB numbers reflect, in part, a location sequentially further toward the eight monolithic pillars from the excavation base-line in the Oval Precinct; that is, they seem to have been recovered 97</page><page sequence="10">WILLIAM D. GLANZMAN FIGURE 8. Courtyard of the Peristyle Hall after clearance and collapse of Pillars W1-W6, view to N. Several piles of masonry from the excavation are in the background.

Even today many archaeological expeditions provide artefact contexts only in rudimentary form in their published reports. The situation here reflects the interests of the researchers rather than a desire for a detailed and integrated view of the development and history of the sanctuary. Jamme was concerned with the epigraphic data of the inscriptions and their interpretations, not with architectural or other contextual issues, with two exceptions: his discussion of the eight inscriptions documented on the exterior of the Oval Wall (Jamme 1962: 258-67), and his discussion of the standing and recumbent stones within the Peristyle Hall (1962: 255-7). Albright was concerned primarily with the architecture of the sanctuary rather than its associated artefacts. Nevertheless, both he and Jamme mentioned several important associations. They note that the statue of Macadikarib was found lying on its left side by the base of a pillar (Albright &amp; Jamme 1953: 34); that pillar is located near the west corner of the Peristyle Hall, spanning grid-squares D-10-11 (Albright 1958a: 269), and would thus be next to either Pillar W3 or W4. Over thirty years later Jamme clarified its location as next to Pillar W3 (1986: 62). Another of these associations concerns the four anthropomorphic bronze statuettes and fragments, including the statue of Macadikarib and object No. 12. They clustered within 35-100 cm of the floor level of the courtyard in the Peristyle Hall, even though none were found in situ and neither these pieces nor the other 22 anthropomorphic bronzes fit the cuttings on the numerous stone bases that once carried statues (Albright 1958b: 230). These few data suggest that there may be patterns of distribution of artefacts and inscribed blocks as well as architecture. 98</page><page sequence="11">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQÏS, MÄRIB FIGURE 9.

We have entered the artefact data into a database and have generated computerized plots for all the artefacts that have a grid and depth reference, to see if there are patterns to the distributions of artefacts. Each of the 107 artefacts reported from the Peristyle Hall and the 20 artefacts reported from the Mausoleum has a unique identity and a three- dimensional position; many are fragmentary. Here we grouped each artefact with others most like it, resulting in eleven general categories. Each category has a symbolic icon, and a colour that best reflects its material. The colours are here equated to different grey-scale densities for a black-and-white presentation format. The eleven categories are: bronze anthropomorphic statuary; alabaster and marble bull representations; architectural ('frieze') fragments; statue bases; boxes and tables; altars; ceramic vessels, stone vessels, and metal vessels; jewellery; and daggers. The artefact distribution in horizontal space (Fig. 11) shows several concentrations that were not previously reported. The anthropomorphic bronzes are on either side of the courtyard and in the ambulatory. For those whose gender is known, the females cluster near the east corner. The statuette of Macadikarib is the only one next to Pillar W3, near the north corner of the courtyard platform. The alabaster and marble bull representations cluster near 100</page><page sequence="13">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQÏS, MÄRIB the N comer, while the bronze bull representations are restricted to the west corner. The architectural frieze fragments are closest to the ambulatory, and therefore may have fallen from the upper constructions of the Peristyle Hall. In the compressed, cross-sectional view (Fig. 12) the bottom of the icon represents the depth of the artefact. Potsherds and various stone vessel fragments were present throughout the debris, mostly within 4.00 m of the floor level. Why most of the bronze anthropomorphic statuary pieces and the bull representations were concentrated close to the floor levels remains a mystery. Were they among the first items to be disturbed from their location, perhaps perceived as pagan idolatry? Conclusions Our review has clarified the order and conduct of the Peristyle Hall excavation. We have demonstrated that the sanctuary did have some degree of stratification present, although the excavator was unable to trace it beyond noting its presence beneath a wall of 'slovenly construction1. This later use in the sanctuary most likely relates to a secular function for the structure. Various phases of religious use are seen in the archival photographs, but those relationships await further study. The artefact distributions in the Peristyle Hall have never before been reviewed for what they might offer, nor have they ever been used to locate specific object relationships, probably because of the difficulty in working in an era when computer graphics were not readily available for archaeological research. These are but a few of the most important insights we have discerned. In the months to come there will certainly be more exciting discoveries from the excavation of this, the largest, and perhaps historically the most important, pre-Islamic sanctuary in all of South Arabia. General Organization for Antiquities, Museums and Manuscripts, to join with the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (Sanaa), headed by Dr. Burkhard Vogt, Director, in a joint expedition effort, thus returning to finish off what Dr Wendell Phillips and his team had started just over 45 years ago. I would also like to thank Bill Isenberger of Digital Mapping and Graphics for preparing the computerized data for the plans and drawings, and Anne Woollam for assisting in all phases of this study. Accounts of the descriptions of Arnaud and Halévy, as well as later investigations, are FIGURE 11.

Based on published data. conveniently discussed by Höfher (1952- 1953a; 1952-1953b), Albright (1958: 215-6), Pirenne (1958), and most recently by Robin (1997: cols. 1221-25). Many articles have appeared during and since the AFSM began publication of the results of the Third Arabian Expedition. The most important of these that focus on inscriptions are Doe and Jamme (1968), Jamme (1969: 663), Pirenne (1969a; 1977), Robin (1980) and Bron (1988). For those that focus on the excavation and its interpretation, see Pirenne (1969b), Wissmann (1982: 183-90, 322-7, 342-6) and Jung (1988). Many of the inscriptions documented by Jamme have become a major point of controversy; some of those issues will be the topic of future studies. In addition, the AFSM intends to produce a study containing a complete concordance of all known inscriptions coming from or pertaining to the sanctuary, as well as the presentation of all AFSM archival photographs of the inscriptions. 3 Elsewhere, along the west portion of the wall, the height was preserved as high as 1 1 or 12 courses above this inscription (Albright 1958b: 217). The height of the wall's courses is more accurately given as between 27 and 3 1 cm, with an average of a little less than 29 cm (Albright 1958b: 218). It is just to the right of Wendell Phillips in our Figure 2. ror the sake or consistency with the published reports, we initially follow Albright's (1958b: 216, n. 10) and Jamme's example, where compass directions are not followed, although we here refer to the correct directional alignments of the Peristyle Hall. Jamme does not refer to the pillars along the north-east flank of the hall, to either side of the tripartite entrance. The pillars are thus here referred to as NW1-2, numbered from the tripartite entrance toward the north corner of the hall, and NE 1-2, numbered from the tripartite entrance toward the east corner of the hall. Pillar 102</page><page sequence="15">DIGGING DEEPER: THE FIRST SEASON OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AFSM ON THE MAHRAM BILQlS, MÃRIB NE2 is thus incorporated into the terminus of the wall flanking the northern side of the staircase in the east corner, while Pillars NW1 and NEI are opposite the two buttresses of the hall's tripartite entrance. 7 This inscription is not certainly represented in Jamme's study, as too few inscribed objects have their excavated context cited. Perhaps this wall was in Albright's mind when he wrote of the one against Pillar W2 (Albright 1958b: 229; Jamme 1962: 255, n.l), since several of the smaller masonry fragments here may carry inscriptions in addition to the long block. Alternatively, Albright may have referred to the smaller stones that fell from the late phase wall when Pillars W1-W6 collapsed. Jamme did not publish the MaMB-numbers for Ja 400 and Ja 401. The two bronze plaques, Ja 831 and Ja 832, studied by Jamme (1962: 245, pl. 51) are also discussed by Albright (1958: 226, 228- 31, pis 166, 172), yet are not included in his catalogue, presumably because they were found in situ and their inscriptions were clearly visible when found.
