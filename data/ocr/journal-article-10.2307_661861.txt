<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS1 By M. B. EMENEAU IN societies organized in sibs, the sib unit sometimes has a name which is borne by all its members. Personal names often have no relation to the sib unit, but either are drawn from a common stock which may be utilized indiscriminately by all the sibs, or are invented according to patterns which are distinct from the pattern of sib-division. The latter type is seen in the system employed by the Plains Indians of North America. The former re- sembles the family naming system employed normally in European or European-derived cultures, where it is not combined with a sib-division except in such groups as the Scottish clans. ?1. An example of sib-division combined with utilization of a common stock of personal names is seen in the Coorgs of South India. Among these people the patrilineal sibs have each a name which is borne by every member of the sib. Personal names are drawn from a rather small stock, consisting of some sixty names for men and a slightly smaller number for women. A male or an unmarried female is identified by the sib-name, the father's personal name, and the individual's personal name, in this order. A married female bears her husband's sib-name, his personal name, and her own personal name. There seems to be no tendency for personal names to be linked with particular sibs. A slight tendency is found to preserve the use of particular personal names within the family (as distinguished from the sib) by giving to a child the name of some dead ancestor within the family whose memory it is desired to perpetuate. It is doubtful, however, whether this tendency has even as much force as the similar tendency in European or American society; a notable difference between the two is that the Coorgs do not give such names during the lifetime of the earlier bearer of the name, since this would cause a certain amount of confusion within the family. ?2. Among the Todas, a pastoral tribe of the Nilgiris in South India, the method of giving names is different from both those outlined above. The individual does not bear a name which is common to all members of his 1 This paper represents a small part of the work which I have done on the non-literary languages of South India, under the auspices and with the financial aid of the American Coun- cil of Learned Societies in 1935-36 and of the American Philosophical Society (Penrose Fund) in 1936-37. I have to acknowledge my gratitude to Dr David Mandelbaum, who read over the paper and made numerous helpful suggestions. The system of phonemic writing for Toda words is the same as that employed in my paper, Toda Marriage Regulations and Taboos (American Anthropologist, Vol. 39, pp. 103-12, 1937); in that paper, f, 0, x should be read for v, 8, y in Toda words throughout. Accent is always on the initial syllable. 205</page><page sequence="2">206 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 patrilineal sib. Only one name is borne by each individual. Rivers' mentions the fact that, if two individuals bear the same name, one of them will change his name. Such identity of name is avoided merely to escape con- fusion and misunderstanding. Identical names can seldom occur among men for reasons that will be clear later in this paper. They are more likely to occur among women. One recent case is that of two women who were named sondarildz. One of these is the daughter of ilmtuxftun (19, Imokhvan)3 and she retains the name in this form. The other is the daughter of midzxtiu,:r (63, Midjkudr); she is usually called sonduir to distinguish her from the other, though her full name may still be used when there is no possibility of confusion. ?3. To make clear the background of the naming system it is necessary to clarify the religious system of the Todas. Each sib possesses a number of munds,4 which are essentially holy places or gods with dwelling houses at- tached. The holy place or god is the localized dairy-complex, all the ele- ments of which are holy. The elements are the sacred buffaloes (as opposed to the non-sacred buffaloes), the dairies, and the milk of the buffaloes. No further localization of the divinity appears to be made within the complex. All the contents of the dairies, bells, tools, coagulant (called pep), partake to some degree of the holiness of the complex, and, like the buffaloes and the milk, must not be profaned by contact with profane persons; but it cannot be discovered that any object or place is especially the seat of the divinity. Linguistic evidence has made it clear that this is correct. In both songs and speech the mund (excluding the dwelling houses) is referred to as t6Bi "god" or no'r "sacred place" or by the compound t6tino:r, and my informants can make no distinction between these terms, or between mod "mund" and no'.r when these two form a pair in the songs.5 These divinities are to some extent anthropomorphic, since it is said that all the gods, including the gods of the Hindu pantheon worshipped in the plains, the Toda gods who are mountains and rivers of the Nilgiris, as well as the god 6in who lives in the world of the dead, and the gods who are the munds, i.e. the t6tino:r, hold assemblies to settle their disputes in the dairy of the mund mylnj. 2 W. H. R. Rivers, The Todas (London, 1906), p. 625. He has a chapter on "Personal Names," pp. 619-27. 3 The number of the genealogical table in Rivers and the spelling of the name in the table will be given for each individual mentioned. 4 Toda terminology applies the word mod to (1) the sib as a whole, (2) each separate dairy institution plus a dwelling place which belongs to the sib, and in several other ways which are not in point here. 5 For the technique of the songs, see my paper, The Songs of the Todas (Proceedings. American Philosophical Society, Vol. 77, pp. 543-60, 1937).</page><page sequence="3">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 207 It is said that the munds and the other gods assemble there, and their ap- proach and departure are known to the Todas when they see whirlwinds going into or leaving the dairy. All lamps when they are extinguished at night go to this dairy to provide light in case the gods are holding a night- assembly. ?4. The prayer at each dairy is made up of a list of names of objects con- nected with the dairy-complex, in forms usually different from their ordi- nary names. These are the kuiasm (the word is best translated as "sacred name"). For each mund (in sense 2 of footnote 4) there is a pair of kiiasm, as also for the people of the sib as a whole (among the tor0Oaso:l moiety, but not among the t6iifiijo:l), for the buffaloes of the sib, and for the funeral-munds, ti:-dairies (i.e. the most sacred grade of dairy which never has dwelling houses attached), and their buffaloes. Some of the more im- portant mountains, rivers, Badaga villages, and other localities on the Nil- girls have similar pairs of kiiasm, while all the other less important locali- ties, small streams, valleys, ravines, hills, groves and the paths through them, level grounds and rocky grounds on the hills, buffalo tracks, etc., have a name and at least one kiiasm by which they are mentioned in prayers. All these places are regarded as being closely associated with some mund, generally the nearest one. In addition, within the mund there are dairies, pens, calf-sheds, watering-places, rocks, cooking-places used at ceremonies, trees, shady places where the people sit, all with names and at least one kiiasm which is used in prayers. The bells in dairies are also named. All such things and places are referred to in songs also by the kiiasm. MEN'S NAMES ?5. Each sib then has associated with it a large number of names and kiiasm, most of them with sacred associations. It is from these that men are named. In many cases a name is used without change. iiulo:.r of the melga:so:J (48, Ushadr) is named after the chief male funeral-place of the sib. pa:ng (47, Pongg) is named after a bell in one of the dairies of the sib. ma:ka:s of the ka:so:( (10, Makars) has the name of one of the ti:-places of this sib. to:sjalf of the kalso,: (15, Tarziolv) has the name of the kurpolj dairy at the mund ka:s. ko:ndimu:x of the to:rorro:r (23, Kandu) is named after the pen of the kogfolj dairy at the mund to:ro:r. pepo:b of the mel- ga9soir (44, Pepob) has the name of a snake said to live at kusa:s, a mund of the sib. k6aro.rxiimtiut of the k6:ro:ro:1 (26, Keradrkutan) has as his name the second kitasm of the people of the sib. o:tjarz of the pturgorroz: (34, Atiurz) has the second kiiasm of the people of the sib. muno:nbi:Stj, son of kortsi:0j (12, Kacheidi) has one of the kiiasm of the buffaloes of his sib.</page><page sequence="4">208 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 ?6. Most frequently some modification is made in the name. Often this is done to avoid a personal name that is in use simultaneously or that has been used in a previous generation. See e.g. tme0j in ?12 and tx:0jxx:n, the name of his great-grandson explained in ?16. tm:pusxiuamtn, son of taeepax (20, Teipakh), and ttwufnms (25, Tiveners) are both called after the kogfolj dairy at the mund to:ro:r, which is named tmupmsfo:ii. In the case of one man pantus (23, Paners), I was told that his real name is komnmns, which is the first ktiasm of the mund paStalr of the torro:.ro:, but that a real kiiasm of a mund cannot be used in addressing a man for fear he may suffer mis- fortune or die. The name pantus is based on the second ktiasm of this mund, pa'ngub, with unusual changes. This explanation may be correct, but two men of this same sib are called by the unchanged ktiasm of two munds which were abandoned so long ago that the real names are not remembered, viz. 6i'kjalf (24, Irkiolv) after the kiiasm 6irynms, 6,ikjaTf, and o:xiimlI (24, Orguln) after the k iasm o:runms, oxtiminli; the k-iasm are remembered from their use in the prayer of the calf-sacrifice of this sib. That we are not dealing in these two cases with munds whose gods are regarded as no longer existent is clear, for ki.rnyms of the nirjovl (43, Kidrners) derives his name from the unchanged second kiiasm of the mund nirj, and orjxavs of the mi.rovj (16, Odikars) from the unchanged second kiiasm of the mund pan. In fact, so long as an abandoned mund is remembered at all, it may be re- occupied, and it seems clear that the Todas do not believe that the god vanishes when a mund is abandoned. ?7. Modification follows a number of patterns, some of them not always clear. If a place-name is being adapted, such suffixes or second members of compounds which characterize the locality are frequently dropped entirely or replaced by others. E.g. ti imod (24, Teimad) &lt;a valley (pal) called tibimodfal. magoj (24, Mogai) &lt;magojnae:s "cubit (magoj)-shade (nae:s)," a shady place at the male funeral-place tyltsiit of his sib.6 kaka:r (20, Kakar) &lt;kaka'rxiimit, an open place in the middle of thickets (kiimut) near the mund towro,.r. See also kmen in ?16. If another suffix is used, it sometimes is one that is appropriate to the locality, as in ki0Ojmurj (20, Kidimudri) &lt;ki,0jmTun, a mountain; mnan is the peak of a hill and murj may have the same meaning, though it denotes most generally the top of anything which is shaped well, e.g. a conical dairy, a gracefully spreading tree, a man's hair cut in the style peculiar to the Todas. It is probably substituted here be- cause of this emotive connotation. 6 Rivers (p. 623) supposed wrongly that this man was named "from the language of every- day life." His name is undoubtedly the same as the common noun in phonetics, but derived as it is by curtailment of a place-name associated with the sib, its connotations are very dif- ferent from those of the common noun.</page><page sequence="5">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 209 ?8. In many of the names the substituted suffix is -kitui:r. This is clearly the noun kitum:r "stream," "path," or "horn." One man kiia:ngitui:r (63, Kwongudr) is named after kiia:ngitui:r, the meeting place of the as- sembly of the tribe; the place-name is that of a stream flowing in the valley at this place. no:rgiitu:r (62, Nargudr) &lt;a stream and pool near the mund toigoir. In some other personal names it is probable that this suffix has ref- erence to a stream; e.g. iz:xiiu.:r (21, Idrshkwbdr) &lt;il:fal, a valley (pal) near the mund tolro:r; i:dzxiiuu:r (23, Idjkudr) &lt;i:dzfal, a valley near the mund paSta:r; in both these cases the valley has a stream. t6i:sxii.:r (63, Terkudr) &lt;a path near the mund le:ptusgo:r. In many other names how- ever -kiitmur can have no reference to a stream or a path, and there is great probability that the word ktitu:r has its other meaning "horn;" so in fact the Todas analyze the names. The horns of their buffaloes are much ad- mired by the Todas, and in such a buffalo-centred culture it is not surprising that "horn" should be an element in names. This use is clear in such a name as ke:nxiitu:r (62, Kangudr), where ke:n refers to a sacred buffalo of his sib. Such a case as kerxiitumr (63, Kergudr) &lt; the mund kerxo:r, is much less obvious and is clearly of the same nature as those names discussed in ?9. The word has come to be felt as a suffix that may be used with little regard to the meaning but merely for the connotive force. For the specific origin of the use we may, however, reasonably look to the use of stream-names and path-names and the presence in the language of the homonyms kiiau:r "stream" or "path" and kiimir "horn."7 SI have made this specific analysis for the benefit of psychologists who may wish to find in these personal names a phallic significance. Such a significance is certainly not there on the surface. Moreover, in the erotic songs which I have recorded, where phallic symbolism is to be looked for, the horn does not occur as a phallic symbol. A number of such symbols that are used are given in the following paragraphs. The most common symbolism that is to be regarded as sexual is that of the bee and the flower: a specimen of this type is given in The Songs of the Todas, p. 551. I also remark there that the same metaphor is used of a man catching a buffalo at a funeral, and finally in a mar- ginal use to describe the activities of the bed-bug. In one of the songs in which a woman is represented as talking about the party that had come to carry her off to give her in marriage to an old man comes the couplet: pu:fysmitS park a:fius flower-lime fruit crowd-for I became torjo:no:l tu:tk ae:ftus pole-who are-men bushes-to they became i.e. "for the crowd of Toda men I have become a lime; men who are (or, who have) long poles have hidden in the bushes to carry me off." The torj is a long pole carried at a two-day funeral; reference to the lime is common in such connections, especially as a vocative addressed to a beautiful woman. The informants said that in this passage there is another meaning, viz. that since the husband is old, she thinks that all the Todas will come to have intercourse with</page><page sequence="6">210 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 ?9. The frequent suffix -kiTutn has defied analysis. Rivers' thought that it was connected with the word for "horn," but the difference in the quan- tity of the diphthongs makes it unlikely, and my informants refuse to recog- nize any connexion between the two. It may be added to a word, as in putgSofxiitutmn (a son of sirja'r 20) &lt;ptutSof, a mountain near the mund to:ro.r, or it may be substituted for another suffix, as in tx:pupsxii"mt n (20; referred in ?6) &lt; ttupusfo:ii, the kogfolj dairy at to:ro:r; kae:nxiitutn, son of to:li:Oj and nertntus (24, Tbleidi and Nertiners) &lt;kaemnalf, the iiunsoij dairy at the mund karkos. A son of ktiaro:n of the piurgo'rol (34, Kwodron) is named asojxiimutin&lt;asojuxr, the buffaloes of the ti: of this sib. k6ikisjxihutn (20, Kekarikutan, which represents the Toda form of the Badaga name of another man kekae:rjxiimttn in table 25)&lt;k6ikisjxudd, the name of buffalo-track (kudd) leading to the mund to:ro:r. ?10. Another frequent suffixal element is -ftun; e.g. in karorftun (21, Karadrvan) &lt;karor0tut, name of a mountain (ttut) near to:ro:r; turkiiuirfuun (24, Idrkudrvan) &lt;turkiiturfa:tu, a river (pa:u) near Mt. karor; ptutSeftun (24, Pachievan) &lt;ptutSof, a mountain near to:ro,:r (cf. piutSofxihtutn in ?9); kergae'rfuin (25, Kerskedrvan)&lt;kergae'rfa'ui, a stream near the mund paSta'r; asojfuin &lt;asojtur, the buffaloes of the ti, belonging to the puirgo:ro:', is another name of potumn (35, Patirsh; cf. asojxiututn in ?9); mupufuxn (16, Mopuvan) &lt;mupuf, the conspicuous mountain, called Staircase by the English. This element may be added to the name of any old man, apparently as a mark of respect, e.g. pae:0o0. or pae':0oofuxn, kaenodz or kae:nodzftun; and many names which have this final element may also appear without it in familiar speech. Rivers was told that the suffix is the same as the word for the stone circles on the summits of some hills, but the Toda word for these circles is maun, which cannot be connected with the suffix. The word puin, which is the only possibility, means "gold, the gold bangle kept in a dairy; the privates of a small girl; afterwards" and none of these meanings seems to be appropriate, except possibly the first.' her by stealth; each will hide in the bushes and wait for her to come to him. It is undoubtedly the erotic language that suggests this second meaning. The phallic bearings of the passage are obvious. Other passages which can be interpreted as containing sexual symbolism, either conscious or unconscious, will be available when my complete collection of song-texts is published. 8 Rivers, op. cit., p. 619. 9 In case sexual symbolism should be looked for here, I observe that caution must be used. The three meanings given for pmun belong to three South Dravidian words which have quite distinct phonetic forms in most of the other languages, and it may be found that the suffix -ftun derives from still a fourth distinct phonetic entity. Until the historical grammar of Toda</page><page sequence="7">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 211 ?11. Another frequent suffix is -nus. It is found also in a number of kilasm of munds and in these it is possible to find a meaning for it. E.g. mymnj of the kmu:iimulto, is the place where the gods hold their assembly (cf. ?3); its first kiiasm is pa:rnmus which is interpreted by the Todas as "standing-place (nius) of the 1600 (pawrnutr) gods." There seems to be no reason to doubt this interpretation; the gods are said in a song-pair to be 1600 (palrnu'r) and 1800 (pu:tnu:r) in number. If this is correct, nuns, found only as a suffix or second member of a compound, is to be connected with the verb stem n-ul- "to stand;" the change of 1 to s is paralleled else- where in the language. So also the kiiasm ko:nmus of the mund ny:l.1 of the melga'so:( is to be interpreted as ko:n-nus "the place of the god ko'n;" ko:n or ko:nt6ai is the mountain near this mund. The first kiasm of the mund melga:s is na:snuns, clearly to be connected with the two kiiasm of the people of this sib, naosOo:r, na:sfep, the first of which has the element to'r which means the endogamous moiety to:rOaso:j as a whole or the people of each sib of this moiety. The first kiiasm of the buffaloes of this sib, na:siln, is also to be adduced, and the name of the pen at melga:s, na:siiul, (i.e. na:s-tum'n "pen"), which is also the name of a man (45, Narso). What the element nals means is quite unknown; but na:snmus is "the place of the naos." Two munds, ku'urr of the kiu:nmuto:1 and kiia.r0ynj of the pnurgo:ro:l, have kiiatenuis as their first kiasm. This is undoubtedly to be interpreted as "the standing-place of kiiatae:n (the semi-mythical hero who was one of the m6.ro:1 sib);" what connection he had with these two munds is un- known. Two place-names, not kiiasm, with this element are poljntus "the place of the funeral-hut," a male funeral-place of the kmu:uii1to:(, and masnuns, a female funeral-place of the m6:ro:(, with unknown prior member. It is now established that the element -nuis is appropriate in place-names and kiiasm of munds. A brother of mo:ngi:Oj (15, Mongeithi), not recorded in the tables, is kfu:dnuis, whose name is the first kUiasm of the mund kiSker of his sib. ka:snuis (56, Karsners)&lt; the first kiiasm of the mund ta:munx of his sib. The name ki:nuns (26, Kiner) is derived from ki:nurSnuns, the first kiiasm of the mund kO6ro:r, either by omission of the second syllable or by loss of the third syllable and rebuilding of the second on the pattern of other personal names ending in -nuis. For it is certain that -nuis is now felt as a is worked out, we shall not know whether the homonymy is of long standing or very recent, and the chronology should, I think, be taken into account in making any psychoanalytic study. It may be remarked, however, that the meanings "gold" and "privates of a young girl" have been represented by homonyms sufficiently long so that the first word is under a taboo in circumstances where the language-taboos work (see Toda Marriage Regulations and Taboos, p. 110).</page><page sequence="8">212 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 suitable ending for personal names. E.g. pantus and tmtufnTus (?6); kiimurjnius (25, Kudeners) &lt;the relic-burning place ktimurjowsoirm at the funeral-place tyltsTimtu; pit1djnTus (21, Piildenir) &lt;pit1djxasfem, the slope of a hill near the mund ktimurmais; nertnmns (24, Nertiners) &lt;nerpaSt, an alternative name, or uxnerpaSt, the first kiiasm, of the mund tae:lgt iu.r. ?12. Another suffix of quite unknown meaning, but probably originally at home in place-names, is -i:0j. ertsiO0j (20, Ircheidi) is taken without change from the name of a hill near the mund karkos. All the other names with this suffix that I can derive show it as a suffix or as a substitute for some other element; e.g. tTusiOj (20, Tirseidi) &lt;ttmkisjx6Rr, a pool at the mund to:ro:r. He was a brother of ertsi:Oj, but his eldest brother, and so his name was not influenced by the latter's, but vice versa, and both were probably influenced either in formation or in choice by that of their father tae:0j. This last name is puzzling, but is said to be derived from taerf, the name of the mountain near the mund to:ro:r, and we may suspect that -Oj is related to the suffix -it0j. Two other brothers of ttnsit0j have names with the same formative -i:Oj, tmnipi:Oj (Tanpeidi) &lt;kiimit.0mnip, the raised grassy mound (tmnup) where the corpse is laid at the funeral-place tyltsimu1:, and muudbiOj (Madbeithi) &lt;muudbor0mtu, a mountain near towro.r. pa:ki:Oj (21, Parkeidi) &lt;pa:kefem, the slope of a hill near the mund karkos. to'li'Oj (24, Tbleidi)&lt; to:lfamn, a stream (pa:m) near the mund tae:lgiim:.r. It was said that puxlkiOj (22, Pulkeidi) was named after the mund punl- kiim.:r and the mountain ki:0jmuxn near the mund kiimirma:s; this is pos- sible, but derivation from punlkiim:,r alone is possible in view of the pre- ceding examples. kydsi'Oj (21, Kudztheidi) &lt;kyd, a male funeral-place of the to:ro.ro(l. kitimxtiOj (21, Kuteidi) &lt;kim,:t0minp, see tmunpi:Oj above. These two men were brothers, an elder brother was pa'kih0j (explained above), their father was pettimi:Oj and another elder brother was o.rduium:0j; the similarity of endings is striking, and is paralleled by various similarities of ending (such as that given earlier in this paragraph) or of beginning in various families. The ending found in the last two names is probably -tiim'u0j. I know it in these names only. o:rdfimiTuj (Arthothi) derives from o:r0o:(, an open stretch of ground (to:1) near the mund artoil. The origin of petiim'u:j (Peratuthi) is unknown. ?13. Another ending is -odz; e.g. kaernodz (21, Keinodz) &lt;kae:nalf, the imusolj dairy at the mund karkos. This ending appears preceding another suffix in the name of ty/jodzxiim:r, son of to'liOj (24), named after ty/jpml, a path through a thicket near to:ro'r; tyjjxiimr would have been possible, but this name is borne by another man, as is also tyljodz (62, Tiliodz), which is derived from katyfj, the kiiasm of the gateposts of the pen at the mund pi'r.</page><page sequence="9">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 213 ?14. The suffix -o:n is fairly common. The meaning of this suffix is "he who is, or has" (cf. the song passage quoted in appendix to note 7 above); this is clear in the name nasomn (a son of taelpax [20, Teipakh]) "he who has beauty, or is beautiful." From such transparent cases the suffix has spread to other less transparent cases, as e.g. kiiaroln of the piurgovro'l (34, Kwo- dron), who is named after the mund kiiaxr0ynij with shortening of the first vowel (cf. panuns in ?6). The suffix -air is fairly common. I know of one name with this suffix based on the name of a rock at a watering-place (which should end in ar "flat rock"), but my informants were unable to remember the name of the rock; the man's name is sina:r (55, Sinar). Other examples connected with sibs do not occur in my material. sirja:r (20, Siriar) &lt;siriraijgam, the Tamil name ordinarily spelt in English Srirangam. The parents of this man made a vow for children at the temple there. piljair (52, Piliar) seems to be derived from the common noun pilj "silver" by this suffix. However, the name has a peculiar origin in that it was given by this man's recently dead grandfather in a dream experienced by his father. A sib origin could not be given for it, or at least was not sought for; it is, however, based on the familiar type and probably has reference to some sib-object, perhaps the kuirfolj dairy at the mund ktuiiumr, which has as kilasm piljag, which was used unchanged for this man's younger brother (Piliag). ?15. Rivers took -alf (his -olv) to be an ending of personal names as such, as well as an ending of dairy-names. The Todas, however, do not seem to regard it in this manner. In all the examples, with two exceptions, a per- sonal name with this ending is first a dairy-name. So to.sjalf in ?5, and 6ikjalf in ?6; the latter is one kiiasm of an abandoned mund, but in all the cases where a mund has a name of this type as one kiiasm, this represents a dairy at the mund. The two exceptions are kiitusjalf (52, Kuriolv) and paluxkitsjalf (7, Pakursiolv). The former is made from kiutusurn, the ground where the sacred buffalo is killed at pihts, the male funeral-place of the sib, but with its ending derived by the informants from puina:salf, the second kiiasm of the funeral-place, referring to the funeral-hut, which rep- resents a dairy. palm'kilsjaf &lt;pa:tukiksjniir, the watering place of the kurpolj dairy at the mund ka's, with the ending from to'sjalf, the name of the kurpolj dairy. I know of only one dairy-name in po'ii used as a personal name, viz. tyfjpo'ti (12, Tilipa), which is derived from poii0yfjpoxii, the kiiasm of the tinusolj dairy at the mund naesminor. Usually some change is made, as in tumRpusx1iuxtn and ttuifnus in ?6 (cf. ?9 and ?11) and pihStjxitimr in ?21. ? 16.

I could not discover that natylj was ever regularly applied to this locality. tae:0jxae:n (see ?6) is said to be a combination of tae:0j and kae:n, a brother of tae:0j who is not found in the genealogical tables. The latter name is derived from kae'nalf, cf. kae:ngfitutn (?9) and kae:nodz (?13) and see ?7 for the process of formation. The forma- tion of a name by the combination of two others is unusual but it is paral- leled in pmlki:Oj, for which see ?12. ?17. Practically all the names analyzed above are derived by one proc- ess or other from names or kiiasm of things or places closely associated with the sib in each case. Another class of names of men derives from the names of gods of the Hindu pantheon or from temples, if a vow was made to these gods or temples for the birth of a child. So sirja:r in ?14. Others are moironius, a son of ttifi0uxn (23, Teitukhen), named from the goddess mo:ramn, i.e. Mariamma; noixoro:dzn, a son of sirjar (table 20),&lt;noxu:r "Nagore" or no:xu:rxurj "the temple at Nagore" with ro:dzn "king." The famous mosque at this place is treated by the Todas exactly as if it were a Hindu temple, an interesting example of the syncretistic tendencies of an illiterate and untutored Indian community. This name seems to have been influenced phonetically by the word no:xor or no:xoro:f "cobra." ?18. Two names of Hindu divine figures, who do not possess any tem- ples known to the Todas, are known to me. The first is ard3on "Arjuna" (25, Kagerikutan); the representation of Sanskrit n by Toda n is a sporadic and irregular change. This name is also shortened to ard3. The other name is idjo:n (a son of taepax, table 20). This is from idro:dzn "king (ro:dzn) Indra (id)." One of the Toda gods appears in 6iIngimitutn (20, Enkutan); 6 ,n, the god who lives in the world of the dead, is not especially associated with any sib. One of the semi-mythical heroes kiiat6ii, who belonged to the sib of the melga'so:/, had another name mae:ltarz, which is now borne by a man of this sib (44, Meilitars). ?19. I know of one case of a Toda who was given the name of a Hindu of another community, viz. ko'ntsarz, a son of kenodz (table 21), who was named after the Maharaja of Mysore's maternal uncle Kantaraja Arasu, formerly Diwan of the states and known popularly in Mysore as Kantarasu. (arz is the Toda representation of Kannada arasu, which appears in the names of members of the Maharaja's house and is Englished as Urs; it</page><page sequence="11">EMENEAUJ PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 215 also means "Englishman, European in general." It may be that the Tamil arasan is also concerned in the origin of the Toda word, but in that case we should expect final -n to remain.). It is to be expected that names of Badagas might be adapted, and perhaps such cases occur, but I have no record of any. ?20. One name that I know of has reference to an incident in the life of a man's father. udjo:sn (34, Udiosan) was made from udj "a government appointment" and o:sn "he who became," since when this man was born, his father held an appointment as a forest-ranger. ?21. Many of the examples given above are names of men of the to'rolroll sib. In order to give a comprehensive view of all the names of one sib, I collect those here with references to the paragraphs where they are treated above and add all those that have not yet been mentioned. A few names given in Rivers' tables of this sib are not remembered by my informants, either because they belonged to children who died before they made any mark in the tribal life, or because the taboos on the names of the dead have caused them to be forgotten. I mark with an asterisk those names that follow the norm of derivation from names of places, objects, etc., connected with the sib.

This list contains 66 names, plus one alias; 6 of those in Rivers' tables were unknown to my informants. Of the 67 names, 2 are of unknown origin, one (kiiadxarts) is doubtfully connected with the sib, 8 are definitely not connected with the sib, and 56 (55 plus one alias) are definitely con- nected with the sib. Expressed in percentages and counting the one doubtful case with the two of unknown origin, we have approximately 83.6% ac- counted for as being sib-names, 4.5% of unknown origin (and the presump- tion is that they are sib-names), 11.9% derived from other sources than the sib. In a similar enquiry into the names of the pi:to:,, 59 names (one an alias) were known to my informants. Of these, two could not be analyzed but were presumably sib-names, 56 were certainly sib-names, and one was doubtful. This last was ko:mdz6:n (62, Komjon) "queen-bee." When he was born, his parents were living at kafi,0j in the Wynad where honey is</page><page sequence="14">218 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 very plentiful. The informants conjectured that this fact accounts for the name; if so, it too is in a manner a sib-name. Similarly t6:n, a son of piljag (52, Piliag), has as name the word for "honey," said to be used because honey is for the Todas surrounded with taboos and in some sense holy. When the names of the kmLu:imutoil, the sib of this man, were investigated, 100 were sib-names, 3 could not be analyzed but were presumably sib- names, one was of non-Toda origin, one (t6:n) has just been analyzed, and one, pilja:r, is of peculiar origin, for which see ?14. In my investigations I have complete analyses of the names of these three sibs. The latter two are the largest sib of the t6-ifiljo,( moiety and one of the smaller ones. The torro:ro': sib, belonging to the to:r0aso': moiety, is one of the larger sibs of the moiety. Its names show a larger proportion with non-sib and non-Toda origin than either of the other two, and I suspect from the samplings of names that I have made from other sibs that it has probably a higher pro- portion of such names than any other sib. All the larger to'r0aso:, sibs, how- ever, show a few such names. When it is considered that none of these sibs is as large as the kmuiimtox and that the latter has only two names of non- sib and non-Toda origin out of the 106 analyzed, and that the pi:toz: have no name of non-Toda origin and only one that was not certainly derived from the sib, we may see here evidence to substantiate further Rivers' state- ment that the t6iifiljo:, moiety is more conservative than the other. WOMEN'S NAMES ?23. Women's personal names are not derived or allowed to be derived from the sib. It is evident, however, in one case that the thought of a sib- association had operated in the formation of a woman's name; this is the first name treated in the following paragraph. It was difficult to get any definite interpretation of women's names from the men; they are quite un- interested in the matter. Their stock answer is that women's names are derived from names of flowers; but in fact, I have in my material no name so derived. Women informants were no more interested in the matter than the men, though they could analyze the names of men of their father's or husband's sibs with almost as much ease as the men. However, many of the women's names are quite transparent, and some principles can be stated. In a number of cases it is clear that words frequently used in songs are at the base of women's names, and it will emerge in the sequel that association with the songs is to be suspected in most of them. In the detailed discussion of the names song-associations will be pointed out whenever they are known to me. ?24. A frequent suffix of unknown meaning, probably merely a formant</page><page sequence="15">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 219 of female-denoting significance, is -i:dz. E.g. arli:dz (3, Arlidz) is derived by this suffix from arl "small pebbles used in playing jackstraws or as counters in reckoning accounts." This woman was born in the sib of the no :o :.; it was at no :i that the goddess t6: kisj performed her acts of creation and divided up the Todas into sibs and assigned buffaloes to the sibs. In the songs when this is referred to, a usual pair of phrases is: maxarxoj potstueno :r first-hand where (she) placed-sacred place maxararl o :kju0no:r first-pebbles where (she) set out-sacred place i.e. "(no,$) the sacred place where t6akisj in the beginning laid on her hand and set out pebbles in making the divisions." It is clear that arl in the woman's name was used because of the association of her father's sib with t6:kisj, and it is probably significant that no other name has been discov- ered with this element. Another name with this suffix is moni:dz (7, Manidz); mon "soil, owned land" is a member of several pairs in songs- inefae:d3, monefae:ld "quarrels (pae:d3) about women (in, a Badaga word) and land;" inexiia:t kotja0ik woman- bungalow you built monex6:r kerta0ik earth-pool you dammed i.e. "though a woman, you built a fine house and dammed with earth a pool to supply water." tarmi:dz (44, Termidz) &lt;tarm "alms" (indirectly from Sanskrit dharma) has in mind the passage in the songs where a woman is praised for her alms-giving. n~itu:ti:dz (3, Notidz) &lt;nitui:t "a sight," has in mind the pair describing funerals and festivals: kofleoft, konentim ut "dancing (o':t) with the legs (ko:l), sights for the eyes (kon)." poini:dz, daughter of kiiu:lpax (52, Kulpakh) &lt;pon "colored cloth" is probably de- rived from the song-unit otsodjfon which refers to a loincloth put on by men when they drive the buffaloes round in the pen at a two-day funeral. sinildz (21, Sinidz) &lt;sin "gold." la:bi:dz, daughter of t6':kt~i:r (63, Teikudr), &lt;la:bm "profit" (indirectly from Sanskrit labha). ruspojildz (also ru:poj), daughter of k6mntus (34, Kemners), &lt; ru:poj "rupee." ralmildz (38, Ramidz) &lt;Rama, the divine personage. ro:d3ildz, daughter of po:dz (34, Podj),&lt;rold3 "kingdom" (indirectly from Sanskrit rajya). pirki:dz (28, Pirkidz) &lt;pirkitsn, the Toda form of the English name Breeks, after the Collector in the Nilgiris who did ethnological work on the Todas. sonmi:dz (63, Sanmidz) &lt;sonm "the people" (indirectly from Sanskrit jana); this</page><page sequence="16">220 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 name is possibly made with thought of the song-pair: ku .refar, keresonm "a crowd such as has not gathered before, the people in a crowd such as has not assembled before." motSildz (21, Matchidz) &lt;motS "cot," with thought of the song-unit sina0motS "golden cot," which occurs in descriptions of the possessions of a wealthy man or of his wife. ofumlildz (16, Ovalidz; 24, Ovelidz) &lt;oftul "rice puffed over the fire." ?25. The suffix -ar is found in several names; e.g. ko:sar (57, Kosar) &lt;kozs "coin, rupee" and piljar (21, Piliarh) &lt;pilj "silver." noxxoremj (10, Nagerami) contains a suffix -emj found in several other names; the first part of the name is to be compared with the first part of no:xoroldzn (?17). In sinag (27, Sinakh) we have sin "gold" and a suffix -ag. In several names there is a suffix -ml; e.g. sintul (28, Sinul) &lt;sin "gold." ?26. Many names are compounds. Frequent first members are sin "gold," p-un "gold" (used in this sense in songs and proper names only), pilj "silver." E.g. sindarm (10, Sindarm) with tarm "charity" (for the song- association cf. tarmi:dz in ?24); sindagas (62, Sintagars) with tagas "chain," with special reference to a chain as a neck-ornament; sinbonm (63, Sinpanm) with ponm "4-anna piece;" singtiiar, daughter of t6:kuiuir (63), with kiiar "umbrella," a frequent word in songs; sinbydj, daughter of the same man, with pydj "wisdom" (indirectly from Sanskrit buddhi); sinmal, daughter of tmbxtim:r (68, Tebkudr), with mal "mountains, esp. the Nilgiris," a frequent word in songs; sindod (38, Sindod), with tod "army," a frequent word in songs (indirectly from Sanskrit danda); sini:r (56, Sinir), with ni:r "water;" sinuir (41, Sinur), with u:r "town, city;" singupj (14, Sinkupi), with kupj "the cowries or beads dangling in a bunch from a woman's armlet;" sindu'fj (58, Sinduvi), with tu:fj "feather;" sinba0u'fj (65, Sinbuthuvi), with pa(O)-tu:fj "eagle's feather;" sines (8, 40, Siners), with es "leaf;" sindarx (3, 25, 56, Sinderg; 53, Sinterg), with tarx "plate from which food is eaten," and singib (43, Singib), with k6b "small bamboo cup from which milk is poured to drink," probably have reference to feeding visitors in the song-pair: tarxituraSkj, k6biimrfo's "rice in a plate, milk in a cup;" sindturp (68, Sintharap), with tturp "key." In a num- ber of names the vowel -a- is inserted between the two parts of the com- pound: sinamut (43, Sinamut), with mut "pearl;" sinamoij (24, Sinamani), with monj "bell" (see note 10); sinabudf (8, Sinabuv), with pulf "flower;" sinafilj (1, Sinaveli), with pijj "silver." Names with puin "gold" are: pmndulfj (68, Punduvi), with tuzfj "feather;" piunba0ufj (8, Punbuthuvi), with pa0ulfj "eagle's feather;" ptunulr (66, Punur), with u'r "town, city;" ptundarx (26, Piindergh), with tarx, cf. sindarx above. ptunabuif (10, Punabuv), with pulf "flower," contains the inserted vowel -a-. ptundttu-</page><page sequence="17">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 221 teumj (10, Punduteimi), with ttimt "handle of a bamboo vessel" (frequently found in songs), has also the suffix -emj mentioned in ?25. pilj "silver" is found in piljmoSt (54, Pilimasht), with moSt "ax;"'o piljnitr (55, Pilinir), with ni:r "water;" piljmut (35, Pilimut), writh mut "pearl." ?27. As first member of a compound is found nas- 'beauty;" nastu'fj (49, Narstufi), with tuxfj "feather;" naspilj (35, 52, Naspilthi), with pifj "silver." It is found in the form nal- with insertion of -a- in nalabu:f, daughter of panmus (23, Paners), with puff "flower." puif "flower" is found as first member of a compound in pu:filj (20, Puveli), with pijj "silver;" with inserted -a- in pu:famut, daughter of sirja'r (20), with mut "pearl;" with suffix -i:dz and pijj "silver" in pu:fi'dzfilj (65, Puvizveli). ?28. Other compounds are found with more sporadic members. ko'sma:lj, daughter of o:tjarz and udjo:sn (34, Atiurz and Udiosan), from ko's "rupee" and ma:lj "garland;" koisafilj (11, Kosaveli), from ko's "rupee" and pijj "silver" with inserted -a-; cf. ko:sar ?25. nixrfilj (68, Nirveli) from ni:r "water" and pi.j "silver." arzni'r (16, Arsner), from arz "European" and ni:r "water." mutni:rfilj (51, Mutnirveli), from mut "pearl," ni:r "water" and pilj "silver," is rather exceptional in having three members. pumes (23, Pumers), from pum "fruit" and es "leaf;" cf. sines ?26. Several contain English words: so:pni'r (6, Sapnir), from solp "shop" and ni:r "water;" pofturmut, daughter of o:tjarz and udjo:sn (34), from poftur "power," referring to the electric power line across the hills, and mut "pearl." Three refer to Miss C. F. Ling who was formerly a mis- sionary among the Todas." ligmisj (23, Lingimishi) represents Ling Missy (i.e. Miss Ling), which is the ordinary way in which a South Indian would refer to this lady; ligjabu:f, daughter of titugor (48, Ushadr), has pu:f "flower" with an inserted -a- and an unwarranted j; misjamut, daughter of kimntus (34, Kemners), is misj "missy" and mut "pearl" with an in- serted -a-. ?29. Uncompounded words without any suffix are found as names: tuigmu, daughter of kituisjajf (52, Kuriolv), "moon;" saerfer (62, Sever) "1000;" ysmitS (12, Irsimitch) "lime (the fruit)," cf. the appendix to note 7; mu'net (56, Munat), "affection." potonm (34, Paton) is the word found in Sanskrit as pattana "city" and is the usual Toda word for Madras city. kopol (41, Kapal) seems to denote the compound of a bungalow and refers especially in the songs with its pair kotserrj to the law-courts in Ootaca- mund. A few English words have been taken as names changed only to such 10 MoSt "ax" and monj "bell" (cf. sinamoinj ?26) form a song-pair, denoting two of the objects found in dairies. n See The Songs of the Todas, footnote 2 and p. 554.</page><page sequence="18">222 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 an extent that their phonetics follow the Toda pattern: p~e:bj, daughter of 6ikntus (8, Arkners), &lt;"baby;" pentS, daughter of korxfimutn (42, Kadrku- tan),&lt;"bench (i.e. of magistrates in the courts)." The English "station," i.e. police-station, becomes in Toda tae'sn; a woman's name tae:s is derived by dropping -n, which if it were kept would give the word the appearance of a man's name (daughter of kajni:r, 3, Kainir). ?30. The Sanskrit devi "goddess" borrowed indirectly gives ti:fj (8, Tivi). Several goddess names (Hindu) with this as final element are found, among them amandisfj, daughter of kiituldpax (52, Kulpakh), the first ele- ment being Amma, a South Indian word for "goddess;" the whole word probably refers to Mariamma. CONCLUSIONS ?31. Analysis of a large collection of proper names has thus yielded a number of general tendencies. Men's names are in the majority of cases sib-names, based on names and kiiasm "sacred names" of all things con- nected with the patrilineal sib and especially with the gods or munds of the sib. In this the Todas join in principle with many other sib-organized com- munities, in which the individuals of each sib bear a name belonging to the sib, but they differ from other such communities in that while in most each individual uses the name of the sib and a personal name not closely connected with the sib, the Todas use only personal names, which are de- rived from the sib. Of the small residue of names not definitely connected with the sibs, a few are derived from religious entities not closely associated with any sib (e.g. 6i:ngiimutn ?18), and perhaps a larger number are derived from the names of gods of the Hindu pantheon, usually in consequence of a vow made by the man's parents (?17). A very few are derived from more miscellaneous sources (??19, 20). ?32. Women's names on the contrary have nothing to do with the sib with the exception of the one discussed in ?24 and possibly others that I have not discovered.12 Some women's names are simple common nouns, oft- en of non-Toda origin, many more are common nouns with a suffix, and the great majority are compounds of common nouns. Those names bor- rowed from English probably in many cases have a bizarre or perhaps even comic connotation, judging from the facial expressions of my informants 12 It may be noted that though women have no part in the religion of the dairy-complex and are a source of pollution to the complex in many circumstances, they are not debarred from using the kfiasm "sacred names" in composing songs. Here they are entirely on an equal- ity with the men. It has been found too that the women have as good a knowledge of the details of the formation of men's names as the men; cf. ?23.</page><page sequence="19">EMENEAU] PERSONAL NAMES OF THE TODAS 223 when I recorded such names. The tendency appears to use words that have song-associations, and one may refer especially to the large class of names with paun "gold," a word used in this sense in songs and not so used in ordinary speech. It may be that this tendency is even more powerful than appears to the non-Toda observer, since it is extremely difficult for him to know what connotations a word may or may not have and informants are inarticulate on this matter. It may be, again, that the feeling that an out- sider receives, that Toda women's names are generally rather poetical in the Western sense, i.e. in their reference to objects with aesthetic associations, is not entirely in accordance with Toda feelings. I can only adduce a small bit of evidence which I have already used in The Songs of the Todas.13 In composing a song lamenting the death of the late King George V, the com- poser changed kirjsolrd3, the Toda form of the king's name, into sijsolrd3. He gave as the reason for this change that the former is not "poetical" and the latter is; my interpreter explained that kig- suggests the word for "small" while siij- suggests the word for "gold," i.e. sin. This being so, we may conclude that women's names with the element sin "gold" are poetical to the Todas, i.e. they suggest to them the vocabulary of song. We have already seen that those with puin "gold" are poetical in the same sense, and I think that it is possible to conclude that women's names in general have for the Todas much the same connotations that they have for us. They are connected with the expressions of song and derive their connotations from the songs, and so may be justly said to be poetical.
