<plain_text><page sequence="1">More Thought on Thought and Talk JOHN BISHOP Can dumb animals think? Since anything from the merest flickerings of sensory consciousness to highly abstract cogitation might be taken to count as thought, the first step towards an answer is to determine what kind of thinking is meant. Once this is done it appears that the question may be answered merely as a corollary of a general theory of thought. If, for instance, thinking is just the acquisition of certain behavioural dispositions, then languageless animals can think provided they can acquire the relevant dispositions. Or, again, if thinking is silent speech, dumb creatures evidently cannot think. And so on. What is philo- sophically important here is the search for a taxonomy and general theory of thinking. The question whether dumb creatures can think is apparently subsidiary. In this section, I shall suggest that this plausible view is mistaken. The question is important, because it is the site for a last ditch stand by those who maintain that there is a significant difference in kind between man and the rest of nature. Belief in an ontological gulf between humans and other natural beings is widely held to be as deeply mistaken as it was entrenched in a now discredited theistic world-view. Yet many feel uneasy about the alternative continuum assumption. Is there anything other than sentiment to back their view that, though man has some community with wider nature, human life is importantly distinct in kind? Suppose it is agreed that the Cartesian view of man's apartness from nature is to be rejected. Someone who still believes that man is distinct in kind may now try to reformulate his position in epistemological terms. Humans are different, he may suggest, not because they, and only they, have immaterial souls, but because only their behaviour ever requires that special form of 'rational' explanation in which phenomena are accounted for as the outcome of an agent's practical reasoning from his beliefs and intentions. On this view, we are marked off from the brutes because we, and not they, sometimes perform intentional actions-behaviour I I</page><page sequence="2">2 JOHN BISHOP: which needs a form of explanation inapplicable to any other kind of phenomena. This reformulation may seem equally as bold, and equally as mistaken, as its ontological predecessor. Indeed, some may regard the epistemic point merely as a new route to the old ontological truth, taking it that there can be a special kind of explanation uniquely applicable to some human phenomena only if humans differ in being from other behavers. But, even if we may safely put behind us the notion that only an immaterial substance will guarantee us a place but a little lower than the angels on the Great Chain of Being, much remains to be done if the more modest epistemic version of the thesis of man's apartness from nature is to be secured. Each of the following claims will need to be established: (i) that rational explanations constitute a logically distinct form of explanation; (2) that some human phenomena need rational explanation in order to be properly understood; and (3) that no non-human phenomena may rightly be given a rational explanation. Evidently, the thesis is undermined if it can be argued that rational explanation is not a genuine form of explanation at all. I shall assume, however, that it is. Given this, (2) is secured. (i), however, might still be rejected. It has frequently been argued that rational explanation is simply a species of causal, nomo- logical-deductive explanation. If it is true that explaining behaviour in terms of reasons is not logically distinct from ordinary causal explanation, then (i) is false. This is not the place, however, to enter the debate about whether reasons are causes. I will simply observe that (i) might still be defended even if, in some sense, reasons are causes: 'causal explanation' may be a misleading catch-all. For present purposes, however, I shall assume the truth of (i), and consider what may be done to undermine the epistemic formulation of the thesis of human apartness given this, arguably over-generous, assumption. If (i) and (z) are conceded, it remains open to the opponent of the apartness thesis to deny (3), most plausibly by showing that some non-human animal behaviour admits rational explanation. The upshot would then be that, though rationally explained phenomena may enjoy a distinctness from other phenomena</page><page sequence="3">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 3 itself derived from the conceded distinctness of rational explana- tions, the distinction involved does not coincide with the alleged difference in kind between humans and non-humans. Intentional agents may be set apart from the rest of nature: but this is not the key to any special status for human beings. It is at this point that the debate about whether dumb animals can think becomes important. For, one way to establish (3) would be to show, first, that only language users can exhibit behaviour which admits of rational explanation, and second, that humans are the only language users. This way of establishing (3) has a feature pleasing to a defender of the apartness thesis who wishes to avoid the offence of 'speciesism'.' For, this view may allow that humans are special only because-if, indeed, this is true-they happen to be the only language users. If we believe that humans are different, we do not then simply exhibit an irrational prejudice in favour of humans purely because they are members of our own species. Rather, the nub of the claimed difference is the distinction between intentional agents and beings incapable of intentional action. If we find that other beings-perhaps even machines we ourselves have made-can use languages, we shall have to concede that they satisfy a necessary condition for intentional agency- and, indeed, that they are intentional agents, if we make the plausible assumption that the use of language suffices for in- tentional agency. Any rights or duties humans have qua intentional agents will then apply as well to them. Under certain conditions, then, arguably not satisfied by any non-human species we yet know about, the special status humans have would need to be extended to other kinds of beings. The suggested epistemic version of the thesis of human apart- ness thus rests on the claim that only a language user can perform behaviour rightly explained as done by him for reasons of his. And this may be restated as the claim that only language users can have the kinds of practical thoughts which issue in intentional action. If the question, 'Can dumb animals think?' is construed as 'Can dumb animals engage in practical reasoning?' then an affirmative answer to it will confound the defender of human apartness, however enlightened he may be in avoiding speciesism, and however well things may go for him in the defence of (i) and (z). In which case, the apartness thesis will either have to be I See, P. Singer, Animal Liberation; a Nezv Ethics for our Treatmenlt of Animals (New York, 1975), p. 7.</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN BISHOP: restated in its more familiar ontological form, and defended presumably along Cartesian lines, or else abandoned altogether. That, I think, is why the debate about the thoughts of dumb animals is important. II Can dumb animals have the kinds of thoughts involved in prac- tical reasoning towards intentional action? In Sections III and IV I shall argue that a recent argument of Donald Davidson's1 has not succeeded in overturning the prevailing opinion that they can. I shall not claim, however, that the truth of this opinion has been conclusively established. This task is not as straightforward as it looks. At first sight it seems quite easy to show that some dumb creatures not only can but actually do have practical thoughts. A version of the argument Hume employed2 seems satisfactory: aspects of dumb animal behaviour bear striking phenomenal similarities to the kind of intelligent human behaviour which counts as the very paradigm of intentional action-if such human behaviour is explained as the outcome of practical reasoning, then the similar behaviour of languageless behavers may justifiably be similarly explained. Even if Hume's argument is acceptable, it does not have the 'incontestable' (ibid., p. I76) status he claimed for it. As Davidson has warned, we must beware of taking as genuinely explanatory what is no more than habitual anthropomorphism about certain dumb animals.3 First thoughts suggest that some dumb animals do act for reasons. But second thoughts give us pause, as we recognise the gap between behaving as if for a reason and actually acting for a reason. Under what conditions, we shall be led to ask, is it justifiable to accept a rational explanation, and under what conditions should such an account be rejected as personificatory, despite its aptness and explanatory force? The Humean argument ignores the possibility of what we may call the 'personification challenge': one can argue validly from the similarity between a dumb creature's and a human's behaviour to the conclusion that the former as well as the latter is the outcome of practical reasoning I D. Davidson, 'Thought and Talk', in Mind and Language, ed. S. Gutten- plan (Oxford, I975), pp. 7-23. 2 D. Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. L. A. Selby-B3igge (Oxford, I888), Book I, Part III, Section xvi, pp. 176-I79. 3 Davidson, ibid., p. 7.</page><page sequence="5">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 5 only if one can exclude the possibility that the similarity results from anthropomorphic projection. Perhaps this possibility can sometimes rightly be rejected-but, we need an account of the conditions which warrant this. This objection is unfair to Hume, since he rejected any di- chotomy between reason and instinct, maintaining that 'reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls' (ibid., p. I79). Thus, for him, there can be no question whether behaviour is actually produced by reasoning or merely seems to be when in fact it is an instinctive response to stimuli. The present discussion, however, assumes, without argument, that there is an important distinction between reason and instinct, between behaviour rationally explained and behaviour explained purely causally.' The failure of Hume's argument to deal with the personification challenge is thus hardly surprising since this challenge can be made only granted an assumption Hume ex- plicitly denied! In our context, Hume's argument provides only a prima facie case for accepting that some dumb animals some- times act for reasons. Some of the difficulties involved in proceeding beyond a prima facie case for dumb animal thoughts may be appreciated by considering an argument of Armstrong's offered to show that dumb creatures can have beliefs.2 It may appear that a capacity for beliefs will entail a capacity for intentional action, but I shall argue that, when construed so that it is sound, Armstrong's argument does not support the conclusion that dumb animals can engage in practical reasoning. In brief, Armstrong argues that dumb animals can have beliefs because dumb animals can perceive. If beliefs are under- stood merely as states which register information about the environment, then a perceiver must be capable of belief. But this notion of belief is too impoverished to support an inference from a capacity for belief to a capacity for intentional action. To be capable of practical reasoning, an agent must be able to make use of the content of those of its states which bear information. This suggests that Armstrong's argument should be amended: since dumb animals perceive, and modify their behaviour in accordance with what they perceive, dumb animals have beliefs.3 I That is, we assumed the truth of thesis (i), in Section I above. 2 D. M. Armstrong, Belief, Truth and Knowledge (Cambridge, 1973), p. 27. 3 This amendment might perhaps be regarded merely as an elaboration of what perceptual ability entails.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN BISHOP: This amendment does not licence the inference from having beliefs to the capacity for intentional action, however. Practical reasoning is something an agent does: he makes inferences, including the arguably distinctive practical inference from in- tentions and beliefs to an intention to perform some immediately achievable ('basic') action appropriate in the light of those beliefs and intentions. That he intends to achieve E and believes a basic action A to be optimal for this in the circumstances does not necessitate the agent to form the intention to do A-though if he does not form this intention, given that A-type actions are open to him, he makes an elementary blunder. Behaviour explained as intentional action, then, is understood as the outcome of the agent's own-rationally assessable-reasoning from his intentions and beliefs. But information-bearing belief-like states may play a role in the modification of a system's behaviour without its being true that the system acts for a reason. That kind of fiendish missile which modifies its track towards the moving target in accordance with information received through heat sensors provides an unwelcome but apt example of such a system. If it is assumed that there is a distinction between intentional action which issues from practical reasoning and other forms of behaviour suitably adapted to the behaver's environment, it becomes necessary to provide criteria for distinguishing genuine intentional action. This is a difficult task; requiring the discovery of the criteria which warrant rejection of the personification challenge. We have just illustrated the difficulty by discovering that the criteria for having 'beliefs' (in some relatively impover- ished but arguably admissible sense) do not amount to criteria for being able to use beliefs in genuine practical reasoning. Until the right criteria can be provided,' and until we can check whether they can be satisfied by languageless creatures, we must be satisfied with the prima facie case Hume's argument provides, content for the time being to place the onus of proof on him who denies that dumb creatures can have practical thoughts. This sets the scene for Davidson's argument: if it succeeds this onus is discharged. I J. Bennett has made an interesting contribution to this task in Linguistic Behaviour (Cambridge, I976).</page><page sequence="7">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 7 III The often remarked indeterminacy in assigning content to beliefs and intentions attributed to dumb animals is not itself a ground for denying their possession of these states. For, if indeterminacy as such prevented the justifiable attribution of beliefs, then the claim of a language user to be a believer would have to be dismissed also. It might be feasible to argue that only a certain degree of indeterminacy may be tolerated if belief- attributions are to be acceptable: but Davidson's argument in 'Thought and Talk' takes a quite different course, and proceeds on the assumption that all an argument from indeterminacy can show is that 'the fine distinctions we are used to making in the attribution of thoughts' (ibid., p. i6) cannot be employed in the absence of the evidence of speech. With the proviso that, for Davidson, a 'language user' is one who can interpret but not necessarily produce linguistic utter- ances, (ibid., p. 9), his argument may be represented as follows: Premiss I: Only a language user can have the concept of belief; Premiss 2: Only a behaver who has the concept of belief can have beliefs; Conclusion: Only a language user can have beliefs.' Evidently, the argument is valid; and its conclusion implies that languageless animals can neither have practical thoughts nor act for reasons. Davidson supports Premiss I as a consequence of his account of radical interpretation. According to Davidson, to interpret the utterances of a linguistic community from scratch, it is necessary to develop a theory which 'provides truth conditions, more or less in Tarski's style, for all sentences (relativized, as always, to time and speaker)' (ibid., p. zo) of the language concerned. The theory is tested against evidence about the conditions under which sentences in the language are held true. The test procedure is not straightforward, since it is possible that members of a linguistic community might hold true what is objectively false. Davidson expresses Premiss I thus: 'A creature must be a member of a speech community if it is to have the concept of belief'; and Premiss 2 thus: 'Can a creature have a belief if it does not have the concept of belief? It seems to me that it cannot.'</page><page sequence="8">8 JOHN BISHOP: The interpreter thus has to juggle with hypotheses about what members of the community hold true and hypotheses about what they mean in order to arrive at an interpretative theory which 'optimizes' agreement between the speakers of the language and its interpreter. On the account, an interpreter of language must have the concept of belief-must, that is, be capable of having beliefs about beliefs. For, he must have a notion of the difference between a speaker's holding an utterance true and its actually being true. Though I do not find Davidson's metaphor particularly illumin- ating ('The concept of belief thus stands ready to take up the slack between objective truth and the held true' (ibid., p. 22)), it can hardly be denied that this notion involves the concept of belief. Anyone who can believe that someone holds a certain sentence true, and not take it thereby that the sentence is true, must surely be able to have beliefs about beliefs. But at best this shows only that an interpreter of language must have the concept of belief. Premiss I states the converse-and where is the argument for that? If beliefs about beliefs must be beliefs about the holding true of some sentence, then languageless creatures lack the concept of belief as a trivial consequence of lacking the concept of a sentence. But such an assumption is evidently false: someone can have a belief, and deploy it in practical reasoning, without actually formulating any sentences. (Certain highly abstract beliefs may supply the exceptions which prove the rule here.) If beliefs about beliefs must be, or involve, beliefs that a behaver would hold a relevant sentence true under certain conditions, then, again, languageless creatures cannot have the concept of belief. But this assumption, though not so obviously false as the former, begs the question unless supported by further argument. Evidently, languageless beings cannot have the concept of holding a sentence true, nor the concept of any beliefs which can be held only if linguistically expressed (however 'internally'). But more argument is needed to support the assertion that they cannot have the concept of belief at all. Does Davidson supply it? After showing that an interpreter must be able to operate with the notion of belief, Davidson continues as follows: 'We have the idea of belief only from the role of belief in the interpretation of language, for as a private attitude it is not</page><page sequence="9">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 9 intelligible except as an adjustment to the public norm provided by language. It follows that a creature must be a member of a speech community if it is to have the concept of belief.' The truth of Premiss i, then, is affirmed after just one sentence. Does that sentence supply the argument required? The first part of the sentence might be interpreted as a claim about the psychic genesis of the concept of belief: that we acquire it only through having to use it in interpretation. On this construal the claim offers no support for Premiss i. Even if we can develop the concept of belief only as we come to interpret language, there may be other means of acquiring it which may be open to languageless beings. But the genetic construal is too naive, as the second part of the sentence makes clear. A second construal is that the sentence makes a claim about what is needed to render the concept of belief intelligible. It restates the final remark in the previous paragraph that 'we come to understand' belief 'just in connection' with the interpretation of language: unless we understand the role which belief plays (in 'corresponding directly' to the attitude of holding true) in the interpretation of public language, it is im- possible to understand what belief is. I doubt that Davidson does enough to establish this interesting claim. Admittedly, our understanding of belief is agreeably enhanced by reflection on radical interpretation. But a theory of belief which makes no essential reference to language may still be possible.' Be that as it may, what is claimed seems to be that belief can be understood only as somehow essentially connected with language. Davidson's claim would then have a generic affinity with Sellars' view that belief episodes are to be understood as theoretical entities modelled on certain sorts of overt linguistic utterances2: both claims affirm the primacy of reference to language in any adequate account of belief. The theory of belief may, then, need to rest essentially on an understanding of its role in interpretation. But this does not imply that only a language user can have the concept of belief. To have a concept is one thing, to understand it theoretically is another. Admittedly, to have a concept is to have the capacity to I Cf.

But it differs from theoretical under- standing. I understand what blue is, for example, in the sense that I can pick blue from other colours. But my physics is too rusty for me to make the concept of blue intelligible. Davidson needs to establish that the capacity to be aware of beliefs requires linguistic ability. The most his theory of radical interpretation may show, I suggest, is that belief cannot be rendered intelligible without reference to its role in interpretation. There may be more to Davidson's argument, however. It is prima facie unlikely that he fallaciously inferred that only language users can have the concept of belief from the alleged fact that the theory of belief requires reference to linguistic interpretation. Consider his remark, made later by way of comment on what has gone before, that the contrast between true and false belief 'can emerge only in the context of interpretation, which alone forces us to the idea of an objective, public truth' (ibid., p. 22). If this claim is true, then non-interpreters cannot have the concept of belief, since this requires appreciating the contrast between true and false belief. But what justifies this claim? From Davidson's account of radical interpretation we may infer that an interpreter must work with a contrast between true and false belief. We may also, perhaps, infer that a satisfactory theory of truth and belief requires the recognition of the role these concepts play in inter- pretation. Neither of these conclusions suffices to justify restricting the concept of belief to language users, however. But Davidson's claim that it is only 'in the context of interpretation' that we are 'forced to the idea of an objective, public truth' supplies a clue to what I take to be his real argument for Premiss I. First, he appeals to his account of radical interpretation to show that an interpreter is (logically) forced to use the concepts of truth and belief. Though he makes remarks reasonably construed as claiming that reference to interpretation is essential for an adequate theory of truth and belief, these are subsidiary to the argument's main purpose. For he then issues a challenge-to explain how the concepts of truth and belief could be (logically) forced upon a mind other than in the context of its interpretation of language. The presumed lack of response he takes as sufficient to show that interpreters and only interpreters can have the concepts of truth and belief. Thus, he neither negligently slides from a claim to its converse, nor does he fallaciously infer from conditions for theoretically understanding</page><page sequence="11">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK II a concept to conditions for its possession: rather, he appeals to us to give an account of how it could possibly be that a languageless animal might believe that some agent had a certain (true or false) belief, given that beliefs are 'inner' states undetectable as such by sense organs. How someone can have the idea of belief though he can never sense beliefs is explicable if he is an interpreter of language. Otherwise, Davidson suggests, this is inexplicable- and so the attribution of beliefs about beliefs to dumb animals cannot be more than philosophically dangerous personification. This argument has some force, but it is not conclusive. For one thing, the assumption that the attribution of the concept of belief to a behaver is justified only if it can be explained how such a behaver could possibly be aware of beliefs is open to doubt. Why is it necessary to show how the concept of belief is logically forced upon someone in order to secure the claim that he has it? Furthermore, Davidson's argument does not overturn, and, indeed, ignores, the prima facie case in favour of allowing that dumb animals can have the concept of belief. In the course of defending his Meaning-Nominalist strategy, Jonathan Bennett' argues that we may describe behaviour involving no use of overt language which seems to call for explanation in terms of the behaver's beliefs about, or intentions to produce, beliefs. It would be a mistake to hold that the possibility of such situations establishes that dumb creatures can have the concept of belief-for the personification challenge has still to be met-but there is no doubt that, with the assistance of the Humean argument from analogy, it does provide a prima facie case for this. How will Davidson cope with someone like Bennett, then? Davidson's 'how could dumb animals possibly have the concept of belief?' challenge can be countered by Bennett's 'how could it possibly be denied that they can?' once it is conceded (as it surely must) that the situations whose description he sketched are logically possible. In a tussle over who bears the onus of proof, Davidson loses, for he rejects the prima facie case for conceding that dumb creatures can have the concept of belief only because he requires a 'transcendental' explanation of how this concept is possible and finds he can give one only for language users. In the first place, a parallel explana- tion may be possible for the case of the non-interpreter. Perhaps a more sympathetic reading of theories of belief which do not rely on an essential link with language would reveal what the Bennett, op. cit., Sections 34 and 38.</page><page sequence="12">12 JOHN BISHOP: explanation is. In the second place, the presumption-if there is one-that such an explanation is required is certainly not strong enough to overturn the other presumption that, since it is logically possible for dumb creatures to exhibit behaviour explicable in terms of their having beliefs about and intentions to produce beliefs, languageless creatures can have the concept of belief. Or, at least, if Davidson's presumption is the stronger this itself needs considerable defence. In the meantime, Premiss I remains un- supported. IV Davidson fails to show that languageless creatures cannot have the concept of belief-but someone else may succeed. It might be argued, for instance, that only someone capable of pretence can have the concept of belief, and that only language users can pretend.' Given this, it is worthwhile considering Davidson's argument for the claim that only if he has the concept of belief can a behaver have beliefs at all (Premiss 2). Davidson's argument for Premiss 2 may be put thus: to have beliefs one must understand the possibility of being mistaken and so grasp the contrast between truth and error; this in turn requires an understanding of the distinction between true and false belief, and therefore, the possession of the concept of belief.2 One way to rebut this argument is to deny that a believer must have the concept of error. This creates difficulties, however. If it is not necessary that a system capable of belief be able to recognise and respond to errors in its belief set, then what distinguishes a capacity for belief from the mere capacity for registering in- formation about the environment? Recall that we take it that there is a distinction between systems whose adapted responses result from practical reasoning and systems whose adapted responses do not, even though their responses may properly be described as caused by information-registering states. It might be suggested that attributions of belief to a system will be secured if it has belief-like information-registering states which I Bernard Williams subscribes to the former opinion in 'Deciding to Believe' in Problems of the Self, Philosophical Papers, I956-72 (Cambridge, 1973) and Wittgenstein held the latter-see Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (reprinted, Oxford, I972), p. 229. 2 See Davidson, ibid., p. 22.</page><page sequence="13">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 13 sometimes lead to inappropriate behaviour. Lauchlan Chipman proposes' that the point of attributing beliefs to a dog, say, will be secured if we can establish that the dog's 'belief system' 'guides it wrongly from time to time', even though the dog knows nothing of his mistake. But then there would be point in attributing beliefs to the heat-seeking missiles mentioned in Section II, since, presumably, they sometimes go wrong and are 'misled' by their information-registering states. The fly which batters itself repeatedly against the window is caused to behave inappropriately by its 'guiding mechanisms'. But the fly does not have the mistaken belief that the window affords an exit, even if there is some state which it is in which may fairly be described-in view of its functional role in the fly's guidance system-as registering something like that information. The fly does not have this belief because the fly is not and cannot be practically reasoning from the belief to its sadly ineffective behaviour. Its information-bearing states do affect its behaviour- but not in the way beliefs do when an agent uses them in his practical reasoning. (I do not deny, of course, that genuine beliefs may affect behaviour other than through the agent's practical reasoning.) The capacity to 'make mistakes' does not entail the capacity for belief, if the former is understood just as the capacity to behave inappropriately as a causal consequence of being in a state registering false information. For the capacity for belief requires the ability to reason from beliefs and intentions to appropriate intentional action. It is a necessary condition for a system to have beliefs that it be capable of recognising its mistakes and responding accordingly. (The behavioural criteria which mark the satisfaction of this condition are presumably the criteria for educability.)2 It will not do, then, to object to Davidson's argument for Premiss 2 by denying that a believer needs to have the concept of error. Any system which makes mistakes but cannot itself recognise them is unable to act for a reason-it may have belief-like states, but it will lack the genuine kind of belief which can play its role in practical reasoning. I In his unpublished Presidential Address to the Australasian Association of Philosophers, Melbourne, 1976. I am indebted to Professor Chipman for allowing me to see and quote from the manuscript of his address. His objections to Davidson, though different from mine, assisted me in clarify- ing my own position. 2 See Bennett, op. cit., Section 25.</page><page sequence="14">I4 JOHN BISHOP: The next move in Davidson's argument is the assertion that to have the notion of error one must have the concept of belief, pre- sumably just because to be in error is to have a false belief. I think a legitimate doubt may be raised about this. Can it simply be assumed that one who is capable of believing that he is in error must recognise that when he is in error he has a false belief, and so must have the concept of belief? It is an analysis, albeit a very straightforward and uncontroversial one, that we give when we say that to be in error is to have a false belief. May it not be possible to have the concept without knowing the analysis- without even possessing a concept essential to that analysis? I do not see how to exclude this possibility. Yet Davidson may reasonably be asked to support his case for Premiss 2 by doing so. Admittedly, if it is put to a language user that to be in error is to have a false belief, and he rejects this analysis, we may conclude that he does not have the notion of error, given that we are sure that he understands what we mean by 'having a false belief'. But this shows only that one who has the notion of error, and is capable of considering verbally formulated analyses of this notion, must accept, when it is put to him, and when he understands what is claimed, that to be in error is to have a false belief. This does not entail that any being with the concept of error must accept that to be in error is to have a false belief (and so must have the notion of belief), since it remains possible that the notion of error should be held by a being who, since he is not a language user, is incapable of accepting or rejecting linguistically formulated analyses. Davidson notes, as we observed at the beginning of Section III, that there are difficulties in determining the precise content of a dumb animal's belief. May such a difficulty not arise here, to Davidson's embarrassment? May it not be misleading to suppose that when a dumb animal recognises that he is in error the content of the belief he thus acquires may be represented as 'I have such-and-such a false belief'? I will not myself venture to suggest any alternative to the natural account of the recognition of error as a matter of realising that some item-belief, sentence, proposition-fails the conditions for truth. I am bothered, however, by the possibility of such an alternative. Admittedly, if Fido is in error then he has a false belief. And when he discovers his error, we naturally describe him as having recognised the falsity of his belief-a mental item whose intentionality we (necessarily) characterise linguistically.</page><page sequence="15">MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK 15 Can we be sure, however, that things are not different for him? May it not be that when he, or any other non-language user, recognises error he does not exercise any concept of a content- bearing mental item? I do not see how to dispose of these questions. I suspect, then, that the account of the recognition of error which Davidson needs to establish Premiss 2 presupposes, in effect, that what is involved in a language user's self-conscious awarencss of an error ('Goodness! I really thought he could be trusted! What a fool I was to believe that!') provides the model for all recognition of error. In the present context, that assumption begs important questions. V I have raised difficulties about the acceptance of both the premisses Davidson needs to establish his claim that only a language user can have the kinds of beliefs that are involved in practical reasoning towards intentional action. I do not, however, claim to have shown that either premiss is false. And I emphasise that it has not been an upshot of my critique of Davidson's argument that a case has been made, beyond the prima facie one Hume supplies, for accepting that languageless creatures can have beliefs and act for reasons. It may be true, for all that I have said, that 'a creature cannot have thoughts unless it is an interpreter of the speech of another'.1 Thus, thesis (3)2 in the case for an epistemic account of what marks humans off from the rest of nature may still be tenable. Of course, arguments have been proposed purporting to show that it is false that only a language user can have beliefs or perform intentional actions. I believe these may be grouped in two cate- gories. First, there have been attempts to sophisticate Hume's argument: the strategy is to show that we may imagine a language- less being exhibiting behaviour so complex and so intelligently suited to its circumstances that it would be just absurd to take the personification challenge seriously, unless, perhaps, one is prepared to accept that explanations in terms of practical reasoning are always but speciously explanatory. This strategy has proved persuasive: for example, arguments of this kind influenced I Davidson, ibid., p. 9. 2 See Section I, above.</page><page sequence="16">i6 JOHN BISHOP: MORE THOUGHT ON THOUGHT AND TALK Jonathan Bennett to reverse the position he defended in Rational- ity.' Second, it has been suggested that evidence for dumb animal belief could be provided, in principle, on the basis of psycho- physical laws (or perhaps non-lawful correlations).2 By investi- gating the neurophysiology of language users we may discover that the belief that p is correlated with some neural state, S. Unless S-type states cannot, for some reason of principle, be possessed by languageless creatures, we may argue that there is no conceptual barrier to the attribution of beliefs to non-language users, and so at least blunt the edge of the personification challenge to the Humean analogy argument for dumb animal beliefs. One day we may discover that a dumb animal whose behaviour suggests (via the Humean argument) that he is using the belief that p in practical reasoning is in that very neural state which we know, on independent grounds, to be correlated with thinking that p. It is of interest to note that, should this strategy require appeal to the possibility of psychophysical laws rather than mere generalisations, it will be in conflict with another of Davidson's theses-namely, that such laws are impossible.3 I shall not discuss either of these strategies here. Should it turn out that they are unsuccessful (as I believe, and hope else- where to argue), the difficulties I have raised for Davidson's argument might then appear more as obstacles to be overcome than as objections which warrant its dismissal as powerless to overthrow the prima facie case Hume made for accepting that, though dumb creatures may be spared some of the thoughts which torment us, they can certainly reason practically and act in- tentionally.4 UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG J. Bennett, Rationality: An Essay Towards Analysis (London, 1964). As Bennett admits in Linguistic Behaviour, p. IO9, he found Robert Kirk's arguments persuasive (in 'Rationality without Language', Mind, lxxvi, I967, pp. 369-386). Kirk argues that a languageless creature could in principle exhibit the kind of overt behaviour which goes with scientific experimental investigation. 2 See Armstrong, op. cit., pp. 34-35. 3 This thesis is advanced in several places, for example in 'Mental Events', in Experience and Theory, eds. L. Foster and J. W. Swanson (London, I970). 4 An earlier version of this paper was read to two separate meetings of the A.A.P. I am grateful for the assistance I have received from participants in discussion at these meetings.</page></plain_text>
