<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 01EARLY WORK BY   THE GIANTS Palaeolithic humans—with excellent vision and endless opportunity—must  have examined honeybees busy at their work and wondered what the insects  saw and what they were doing, just as somebody else, watching the humans  in turn, wondered what on earth they were doing studying bees. For a social  animal, it was important to know who was watching what.  The powerful obstacle to understanding what bees see—and they obviously see  something—is that the human mind reads itself into the minds of others, even  into bees. We call it anthropomorphism. We imagine that the bees are seeing  things. We see the bee and the bees see us, which becomes obvious if we steal  their honey. So, for about two millennia since Aristotle, the general opinion  seems to have been that the bees see things and organise their affairs very much  as we do. They see flowers; they collect honey; they fly home; they defend their  store; the drones pursue the virgin queen. It is like a play based on the human  world, just as Shakespeare described: For so work the honeybees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king and officers of sorts, Where some like magistrates correct at home, Others like merchants venture trade abroad, Others like soldiers armed in their stings Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds, Which pillage, they with merry march bring home.1 We now know much more, but a veil will always obscure our understanding  of what bees see because we are not in a position to observe it ourselves. The  collapse of confidence in the reality of human perception began with René  Descartes (1596–1650) and proceeded through Bishop George Berkeley (1685– 1753) and the French rationalists of the eighteenth century.2 Now it is the turn  1 </page> <page sequence="2"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW? of the bees. The interest now lies in how the bees manage to do so much with a  tiny brain, how humans have evolved scientific techniques to investigate them  and how and what they see. Nineteenth-century beginnings The giants—or rather, gentlemen of leisure—on whose shoulders we stand began  systematic observations and the experimental approach only in the nineteenth  century. Sir John Lubbock (1834–1913), a polymath, who invented, among  other things, bank holidays and the term ‘Palaeolithic’, published his own  careful observations of the behaviour of ants, bees and wasps about 1873.3 He  found that ants detected ultraviolet (UV) light and that blue was their preferred  colour. When he carried bees away from the hive and gave them honey, they  rarely returned for more (they were probably not foragers). When he fed them  in an upstairs room, they failed to recruit other bees (they could not remember  heights above ground). His writing illustrated his difficulties because he could  not refer to a body of reliable observations and there were no relevant theories.  Auguste Forel (1848–1931), a remarkable medical professor in Zürich and  best known as a psychiatrist and expert on Hymenoptera, aimed to eliminate  anthropomorphic ideas from the study of insect behaviour.4 One of his targets  was Felix Plateau (1841–1911), the Professor of Zoology at the University  of Ghent, Belgium, who had the misfortune to be the son of a very famous  mathematician. Between 1885 and 1899, Felix studied how bees found flowers  and published many papers.5 Unhappily, he repeatedly produced the wrong  answers, so they caught the eye of one or two critical scientists.  Plateau tried to attract the bees with paper flowers that were carefully painted  with natural colours. He also hid dahlia flowers behind paper but the bees went  under the paper, so he concluded that the shape and colour did not attract  them. Because the bees ignored his flowers, he concluded that bees recognised  flowers by their odour, not by vision of shapes or colours. He was unwilling to  concede that the bees remembered the place of the reward by use of landmarks.  On the numerous works of Plateau, Forel (1908) lamented:  It is with reluctance that I have decided to undertake the criticism of  this author, not, indeed, that it will be difficult, but because of the space  which it demands, and because it is painful to me to have to bring to  light the false conclusions of a colleague whose patience, work, honour  and good faith I esteem.  Forel then launched without mercy into 50 pages of objections, supported by  his own experiments.  2 </page> <page sequence="3"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS Plateau worked with large artificial flowers that were scarcely distinguishable  from real flowers. The bees passed them by, so he supposed that the match of  the colours was unsuited for the bees. Forel repeated the experiment with crude  artificial flowers, laced with honey and found that bees would not visit them  unless they found the honey by chance, or had it pushed at them. They would  then return repeatedly to the same artificial flower. Plateau persisted with his  contention that the bees used their sense of smell, but other published work had  shown that bumblebees returned to their flowers when their antennae, palps,  mouth and pharynx (that is, the seat of the sense of smell) had been removed. After 50 pages of fierce criticisms, Forel accepted the correct data but not the  false conclusions:  I must make an excuse for my long criticism and my long series of  controls, as much to M. Plateau as to the reader. But it was necessary.  In using the experiments of M. Plateau himself to show the errors  of judgement that he draws from them, I fully render homage to his  scientific honesty. And it is precisely this honesty which has allowed  us to follow the author step by step, and to pick up, by the help of  his faithful narration of facts, the thread of their actual connections  [how the facts relate to each other] and their agreement [that they are  mutually consistent]. Thanks to this, our study will not have been a  sterile polemic, for it has brought us to see more and more clearly into  the very question which occupies us. (Forel 1908) Modern science has lost this art of pulling the rug from under one’s opponent. The main obstacle to this research was that the bees had already arrived at  their destination, with a memory of what they expected to find, so, in any  experiment, they were likely to be frustrated by any change and would either  start to relearn the place of the reward or simply go away.  Forel was one of the first to use individually marked bees effectively in a variety  of experiments. Confirming earlier work by Lubbock, he stressed that the bees  did not follow an experienced bee, but they were attracted to a number of bees  feeding and they remembered the place where they found food. To Forel, these  observations showed that feeding bees made little use of their sense of smell.  Forel also concluded that bees distinguished the contours of objects poorly and  that they returned to any shape that offered them honey at the expected place.  ‘Vision of form, colour, dimension and distance...guides the bees by means of  visual recollections associated to those of taste and smell’ (Forel 1908). In the nineteenth century, public criticism was more robust than we enjoy  today. Serious scientists flung identifiable mud at one another’s conclusions and  sometimes at the experiments themselves. For example, Forel again: 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW? The publications which have appeared on the subject before us are very  numerous, but they consist for the most part of theoretical dissertations  only, of hypothesis, and, as Lubbock (Linn. Soc. Journal vol 12,  Observations on bees and ants) has very well remarked, of oft-told tales  of ancient experiments, borrowed, through more than a century, from  one ‘authority’ to another, without attempt at control or checking.  (Forel 1908:5)  The philosopher of scientific method, Karl Popper, would have appreciated this  approach: not advancing on the shoulders of others, but shooting them down.  In the end, Rabaud (1928) covered the literature in French but did not refer to  Plateau’s numerous works. Professor Albrecht Bethe (1872–1954), father of Hans, the physicist, was a  versatile physiologist and anatomist of the nervous system, sometimes called  the ‘conscience of German biological science’ of the time because he brought  attention to the errors of the other professors—not a bad idea, actually. For  Bethe, all comparative psychology of animals was an absurdity. His paper of  1898 illustrates the conflict between the general belief in bees’ cognitive powers  versus the experimental evidence of their extreme stupidity. He replaced his  beehive with an empty hive with an open back, so that returning bees flew out  through the back and continued repeating this manoeuvre. When he moved  a normal hive back by a metre, the bees stopped at the former position of the  entrance as a cloud in the air, failing to recognise the hive. These observations  were old hat to beekeepers, illustrating the isolation of professors from artisans.  Bethe’s belief in mechanistic analysis guided him to do experimental tests. His  experiments proved to him something beyond the science of the day: the bees  did not locate their hive by scent and could do so after their antennae were cut  off. When a hive was closed at night, and opened the next day in a new place far  away, at first the released bees made short exploratory flights and returned to the  hive. They remembered the new position of the entrance with great precision  and appeared to be guided by something external to the hive. Similarly, when  carried in a box for up to two kilometres, either they flew upwards and headed  in the direction of home or they flew in a circle and returned to the box. After  many such experiments, Bethe logically concluded that the bees obeyed a force,  absolutely unknown to us, that carried them back to the place in space from  whence they came. At that time, radioactivity, radio waves and x-rays were in  the news and Bethe must have been disappointed with the hilarious reception  of his hypothetical force. Accounts of insect behaviour of the nineteenth century had pages of detail of  how the flowers were arranged or how the bees appeared to do this or that,  repeated with variations in other papers and whole books. We find voluminous  accounts later in the works of Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) and others, but from  1920 onwards the professional journals gave only bare accounts of experiments  4 </page> <page sequence="5"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS and tables of results. Finally, the detailed measurements disappear also and  we moderns are left with boring summaries of methods, results, condensed  diagrams and long reference lists. Unfortunately, the loss of innocence—and  incidentally, disproving the other fellow—was not replaced with a better  design of experiments, greater significance of the results, more critical polemics  or lucid logic in the conclusions.  Scientists of the nineteenth century, such as Lubbock and Romanes, who  understood the experimental method, struggled to separate the mechanistic  analysis from the descriptions of performance. They tried to interpret their  observations on the vision of honeybees, ants and wasps, but sought in vain  for explanations. They had no idea of peripheral processing by connections of  neurons in parallel. Anyway, the neurons were only just being discovered by  new techniques. We find the same in every science, every sphere of activity.  At first, understanding is slow to start because there is no map to guide us  through the jungle of unrelated observations. In the case of honeybee vision,  the early analysis was documented by Lubbock, Romanes, Plateau, Bethe  and Forel, provided with an anatomical substrate in the histological works of  Grenacher and Exner, and the arrays of neurons in parallel were described by  Cajal, Sanchez and Zawarzin.  Forel ejected the nineteenth-century ‘astrologers with their ancient rubbish’  (von Uexkull 1908) with many trenchant comments of his own:  As we have seen, the causes of the erroneous judgements with which  Plateau has obscured the question at issue are errors of interpretation,  inadmissible and continual generalisations, and the almost total omission  of the psychical faculties of the insect, especially with regard to memory  and association. (Forel 1908:193)  He found that the bees learned to return to the place, not to the flower, and  shape was of no significance, but he could take the analysis no further. Later, in  1910, he noted that bees would return at a time of day when they were regularly  given a reward, and so started the study of their time sense. The reward for the  bees was marmalade at breakfast time—a novelty in Switzerland, adopted from  the first English mountaineers.  5 </page> <page sequence="6"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW?

The early twentieth century In 1914, when von Frisch published his results with trained bees, he had been  working at his family’s country house in the Austrian Alps on the colour vision  of freshwater fish, but he turned to bees to give a demonstration of learning  when fish were not available.6 He used Sigmund Freud’s principle of association  by simultaneous presentation. On the balcony of his alpine summer house,  von Frisch copied from a remarkable African-American naturalist Charles  Henry Turner (1867–1923) the method of putting a reward in one of several  small cubical boxes, with a different pattern on the vertical front of each box  (Figure  1.1a). Access to the inside was through a hole in the middle of the  pattern (Turner 1911). von Frisch put a reward of odourless sugar in the box  that displayed the pattern to be learned and nothing in the other boxes. The  6 </page> <page sequence="7"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS positions of the boxes were shuffled in a row all facing the same way, so that  the bees could not learn where to go, but were obliged to look at the patterns  to find the reward. Without realising it, von Frisch (and all others after him  who interchanged the targets) trained the bees to ignore the landmarks that  indicated the exact place of the box. This was an important ingredient in the  experimental design because it made possible the acceptance of unfamiliar  patterns that displayed the same combination of cues.  The criterion of success was the bee landing on the correct reward hole, and  therefore the angular sub-tense of the target was not known at the moment  of the bee’s decision, but could be very large. As later demonstrated by  Baumgärtner (1928) and Friedlaender (1931), the bees took special notice of the  region immediately below and around the reward hole.  Figure 1.2 Results of early experiments. The pairs of flower-like patterns in  (a) and (b) were discriminated from each other in the vertical plane, but those in  (c) were not when presented together. The patterns in (d) laid out flat were not  discriminated, similarly those in (e), but those in (d) were discriminated from those  in (e).

In the first half of the twentieth century, bees were trained to discriminate  between two or more patterns. von Frisch found that bees easily learned the  difference between a flower shape with many small petals and one of the same  size and colour with a few large petals (Figure 1.2a). Also, bees easily discriminate  between pairs of flower-like shapes in which an area of blue and one of yellow  have different positions in the two training patterns, even a left/right reversal  (Figure 1.2b). He demonstrated that bees distinguished yellow and blue from  all shades of grey. He was interested mainly in the bees’ abilities and he had no  particular theory in mind to guide his experiments.  von Frisch proposed that bees were able to distinguish flower-like patterns  because their vision was adapted to their normal repertoire. The idea of pattern  processing being adapted to the normal function was not examined further until  the 1990s. von Frisch’s bees, however, could not learn to discriminate between  a blue square, triangle, disc and a diamond shape (Figure 1.2c) although trained  for five days. This failure would have caused confusion in the literature but  for some reason it was almost ignored for 90 years. Much later, in the decade  between 1995 and 2005, it was discovered that bees learned quite quickly to  discriminate between pairs of these shapes. Probably von Frisch failed with  four shapes because he displayed too many in one task, but that excuse needs  further testing.  von Frisch’s students and younger colleagues found that bees discriminated  between pairs of many varied patterns, but there were other pairs they confused  for no apparent reason. His student Baumgärtner (1928) found that bees could  distinguish between flowers (taken in pairs) with three, four, five or six petals,  if one but not the other had a petal immediately below the reward hole. He was  interested primarily in how well bees detected the place of a coloured patch  relative to the reward hole, and in the angular resolution in behavioural tests  compared with the angles between the receptor axes. Bees could distinguish  between a blue and a yellow 20mm by 20mm square in bright light if they  subtended at least a minimum of 3o at the eye—a result that was ignored for  70 years. Two 5mm by 5mm squares of different colours could be discriminated  from the same squares that were exchanged in position only if they were located  immediately below the reward hole. This was the region that would be visible to  both eyes and outside this area this particular task was impossible (Figure 1.3).  In 1999, I showed that the discrimination of the exchange of positions of two  coloured spots in the horizontal direction was possible only when there was  contrast with the green receptors, which was essential to stabilise the position  of the eye in the horizontal direction. 8 </page> <page sequence="9"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS Figure 1.3 Discrimination between small yellow (Y) and blue (B) squares, with vertical  presentation and landing on the reward hole as the criterion of success. a) Two  examples of the targets. b) The region around the lower lip of the reward hole  where discrimination of the colours is successful (black squares) and unsuccessful  (white squares). c) The overlap between the two eyes in angular coordinates.

Mathilde Hertz (1891–1975), daughter of the physicist Heinrich Hertz and  acquainted with many German scientists, studied bee vision from 1925 to  1936 at the Institut für Bienenkunde in Berlin (where von Frisch worked). She  caused more puzzled brows among reviewers and students than any other bee  researcher in the twentieth century. Her method was to lie a number of patterns  on a white table and place a reward of sugar solution in a glass dish next to the  rewarded pattern. She stressed that the bees could use different parts of their  eyes to discriminate correctly. The patterns were shuffled in position at intervals  to make the bees look for the rewarded one. The bees were therefore trained to  ignore the exact place. On the flat table, with shuffled target positions, the bees  did not discriminate edge orientations or relative locations. Later, we found that  only patterns that were salient for the bees would be learned in these conditions.  Examples are areas of spots, coloured patches, radial patterns, concentric circles  and patterns rich in black/white edges (Chapter 9).  Knowledge about any visual system was in a sorry state at the time. Hertz  used a great variety of training and test patterns, following any idea that the  results suggested and, from 1926 to 1933, discovered many interesting details,  most of which have been neglected for three reasons. First, she wrote in an  obscure style that was difficult to translate. Second, the bees did not correlate  edge orientations with the directions of their sun compass as they flew in all  directions over them, although Wiechert (1938) later showed that bees used edge  orientation on patterns laid flat when restricted in their direction of approach.  Third, having no general paradigm outlining how insect vision operated, Hertz  interpreted everything in terms of the Gestalt theory7 for human vision, as in  Wertheimer (1923), which was briefly expressed as:  There are wholes, the behaviour of which is not determined by that of  their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves  determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole. It was the hope of Gestalt  theory to determine the nature of such wholes. (Wertheimer 1924) As will be seen, the idea of ‘global’ vision had great influence on later research  on bees. On the one hand, Hertz analysed patterns into low-level parameters, such  as area, length of edge and circular versus radial contours, which looked as  though they were fundamental—much of which was later verified. On the  other hand, patterns were classified by arbitrary global characters such as  symmetry, disruption, isotropy, smoothness, texture, variability of patch size  and separation into parts. There was, however, no demonstration that these  categories really had any meaning for bees.  10 </page> <page sequence="11"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS Figure 1.4 The basic separation of figural intensity (disruption) in columns  and figural quality (shape) along rows, when patterns are laid flat. Bees easily  discriminate the patterns on the top row from each other, and with greater  difficulty within each row going downwards. The further the patterns are apart  within each column, the better the bees discriminate them. The numbers indicate  the relative lengths of edge. Source: After Hertz (1933). Although the language and terminology were frequently obscure, the actual data  were not so bad. Hertz discovered that the bees discriminated area or size and  total length of edge (Figure 1.4). The last is sometimes called the disruption of  the pattern and has been mistakenly identified with spatial frequency. The bees  detected radial symmetry about a centre and some major types of pattern such  as blobs, groups of spots, gratings of parallel bars, concentric circles and radial  patterns of bars. In the first 60 years of experiments, only one other parameter  was discovered: the orientation of edges (Turner 1911; Wiechert 1938). 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW? Figure 1.5 An example from Hertz (1933). Bees trained on (a) accepted (b) equally  well. Bees trained on (e) accepted (c) and (d) equally well. Bees trained on (d) or (f)  avoided (a) and (e). These results were a puzzle until it was realised that the bees  learned the modulation and avoided rings and crosses unless trained on them. Gertrud Zerrahn (1933), working in Heidelberg but obviously in touch with  the contemporary work in Berlin and Münich, also presented flat patterns  on a white table. Although the patterns were different, Zerrahn’s conclusions  duplicated some of Hertz’s work, and Zerrahn also showed that the preferences  of untrained bees for patterns of various types mirrored their ability to learn to  discriminate them. A student of Professor Otto Koehler in Königsberg, Marianne Friedlaender  (1931) used the same type of reward boxes as von Frisch. Bees were trained to  discriminate between a rewarded yellow square cross (with bars 40mm by 8mm)  and a square (24mm by 24mm) of the same colour and area, both on a white  background (Figure 1.6a). In a significant advance, the trained bees were given  several tests. Both the cross and the square were accepted as the original when  turned through 45o. Movement of either shape within the target had little effect  on the discrimination. The radial pattern of the square cross had salience for  the bees because they detected it even when it was moved a short distance or  rotated. It was 60 years before the next steps were taken (Chapter 9). Friedlaender found that bees could not discriminate between a target with a  rectangle of grey on the left of the reward hole and one with the rectangle  on the right (Figure 1.6c). When the bees had been trained with radial spokes  adjacent to the rectangles, however, they could do this task and they retained  the discrimination of the locations without the spokes (Figure 1.6b). Moreover,  patterns that included radial spokes could be moved up or down on the targets  without spoiling the discriminations. Her explanation was that the position of  the centre of symmetry of the spokes provided a salient reference point. The  bees in flight scanned continually in the horizontal plane and they failed to  remember the position of an image that was not stabilised on the retina.  12 </page> <page sequence="13"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS Figure 1.6 Early analysis of the effect of a change of location. Each new group of  bees was trained with the pairs of targets on the left and tested with the pairs on  the right.

In tests with the panels moved up, discrimination persists. e) Preference is  reversed when the panels are moved to the right.

Next, bees were trained to discriminate a pattern with a blue patch on the left  of the reward hole and a yellow on the right versus another pattern with the  colours reversed (Figure 1.6). The bees failed in tests when the position of the  reward hole was shifted or one of the patches was omitted. When the bees were  trained with a yellow patch on the left of the reward hole versus a similar patch  on the right of it, moving a patch in the horizontal direction relative to the  reward hole in tests had little effect, but moving a patch in the vertical direction  spoiled the discrimination (Figure 1.6c). These important clues to the bee’s  spatial world were forgotten for 70 years (Chapter 9). Elsbeth Wiechert (1938), another student of Koehler, showed that relative  positions of two rectangles of different colour were discriminated when  displayed in the horizontal plane as well as in the vertical plane, if natural  obstacles restricted the direction of approach of the bees.  Conclusions by mid-twentieth century By 1950, the training patterns had been selected at the whim of each experimenter  and there was still no general idea of bees’ visual mechanisms or how to design  useful experiments. With the aid of hindsight, we can draw out a few useful  generalisations that have been clarified since that time.  One parameter that the bees detected was the disruption of the pattern or the  total length of edge in it. In the oft-copied Figure (1.2d) from the work of Hertz  (1929–31), bees could distinguish between any of the figures in the top row  only with difficulty, but all figures in the top row were easily distinguished  from those in the lower row. The explanation was that the bees learned the  modulation of illumination of the receptors as the eye moved across the figure.  In fact, this result does not apply when the eye is stabilised on very large targets  (as illustrated in Chapters 4 and 9).  It was never asked what was the area in which the length of edge was measured.  The training patterns were always isolated simple shapes, so it seems to have  been believed that the bees first identified the rewarded shape and then  measured its outline. A second generalisation, also from Hertz, was the easy discrimination of radial  patterns of edges and avoidance of circular patterns. Bees trained to go to a  group of spots would not visit a pattern of concentric circles, but those trained  to go to the circles would visit the spots (Figure 1.5). In addition, Friedlaender  found that the centre of a square cross would act as a reference point (Figure  1.6a). Radial bars enabled the bees to discriminate a shift in the position of a  black square (Figures 1.6b and 1.6c). Radial patterns of edges or a dark spot on  a light background were salient to the bee’s eye. Together with the spontaneous  14 </page> <page sequence="15"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS preference and ease of learning of radial patterns, the salience suggested that the  bees’ visual processing was adapted to flower-like forms, as von Frisch (1914)  had suggested. The mechanism, however, remained a mystery. Third, size was discriminated, so, when working with other parameters, patterns  must be of similar size. Baumgärtner, with vertical presentation, had shown that  if a coloured patch was to be discriminated, it must subtend a certain solid angle  at the eye so that many facets were stimulated.  Fourth, bees discriminated easily whether a black spot was above or below  the reward hole. Several authors had shown that bees could learn whether a  yellow patch was to the right or to the left of an adjacent blue patch when both  were close to the reward hole. The reward hole acted as a landmark. No-one,  however, commented that when the reward box with the training pattern on  it was regularly moved to make the bees search for the rewarded pattern, the  bees were still able to discriminate the positions or relative positions within the  training patterns. We now know that shuffling the positions of the reward boxes  during the training causes the trained bees to ignore the local landmarks. They  still used more distant landmarks and learned the range of relative positions of  the parameters in the vertical direction at the places where they were displayed  during the training.  By mid-twentieth century, it was well known that bees knew the approximate  place to come for a reward by using landmarks at different distances and  directions, so it was clear that they also learned the positions of areas of black  or colour relative to a point of reference. As part of the wider field of experimental psychology, it was thought at the  time to be useful to plot the stimulus/response as a function of a variable in  the tests, or a curve that showed the progress of learning. The percentage of  correct responses, however, depends on the training conditions and duration.  For the bee’s visual system, many such empirical relations were published, but  they were almost useless for the analysis of the visual system because there was  only one experimental treatment and no tests of what the trained bees really  detected. Hiatus in Germany All this early twentieth-century research on bee vision was done in Germany.  Almost all the scientists were Jewish or had Jewish relatives. After 1938, research  under von Frisch continued on navigation, route finding and colour and odour  discrimination, but the work on pattern vision ceased until revived in the  1960s. Wolf and Zerrahn emigrated after 1933 and joined Professor Selig Hecht  at Columbia, New York, from where they published many empirical relations  about the vision of the bee and other animals. Again, they were hampered by  lack of a sufficient body of bee neuro-ethology to interpret the measurements.  15 </page> <page sequence="16"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW? Others, such as Harald Esch and Rudolf Jander, later moved to the United  States—not because of persecution by the Nazi regime, but because they were  persecuted by German professors. As a Jewish scientist in Berlin, Hertz was ruined after 1933, and from 1936, she  and her mother lived in Cambridge, England. She was befriended by Bill Thorpe,  a Cambridge don (like Lorenz and Tinbergen, an intuitionist). In Thorpe’s (1956)  otherwise excellent and comprehensive book on insect behaviour, he scarcely  mentioned the discrimination of patterns by trained bees, as though he could  make no sense of what was available to him. His lectures in 1949 to a Cambridge  zoology class revealed to me no insights into the mechanisms or methods of  analysis of insect vision.  There was an enormous number of descriptions of insect taxes, kineses and  tropisms in response to light, but almost all the experiments reported in  the influential textbooks by Willi von Buddenbroch (1937, 1952) and the  handy little book by Carthy (1958)—which was almost all that was available  in English—were unrelated to each other or to a comprehensive theme. The  details of the neurons of insect optic lobes, so beautifully described by Cajal and  Sanchez (1915) or Zawarzin (1913), were ignored as possible substrates of visual  behaviour. The growing knowledge of responses of neurons and the physiology  of synapses was also ignored.  To each generation, honeybee vision simply did not make sense. The reason  for the failures and the confusion that followed, we now see with the benefit  of hindsight, was due only partly to the lack of abundant data and theories to  guide new experiments. In particular, it was never asked whether bee learning  was like wax—which could be moulded to any external shape or pattern— or like a set of innate boxes that could be ticked when a limited variety of  parameters appeared. Consequently, the right experiments were delayed. There  was also the dead weight of the anthropomorphic belief that bees really saw the  things they looked at. There was no theory of how or what insects really saw.  The main problem, however, was the criterion of success (landing on the correct  pattern or reward hole) in the training of the bees, so the experimenter could  not control or infer what parameters the bees were using.  The primacy of odour Worker bees are helped out of their sealed cells by nurse bees and soon take  up a task within the hive, feeding the grubs, filling storage cells with pollen or  nectar, fanning to ventilate, cleaning out old cells or tending the queen. All this  is done in the darkness of the hive, so in the busy life of the young bee every  action is governed by the sense of smell. The bee’s antennae have thousands of  16 </page> <page sequence="17"> EARly WoRk By ThE GIAnTS odour receptors and the main association areas of the brain serve olfaction. Bees  also detect the direction of gravity. The whole world of the young bee is one of  odour, up/down, touch and taste. After two or three weeks of working in the hive, the young bees are like those  unenlightened human beings living in a dark cave, as described by Plato in  Book 7 of The Republic.  The mouth of the cave is open, but the unenlightened slaves see only shadows of  themselves, like shadow puppets on the opposite wall, never their true nature.  Similarly, the young bee has sensed the real world of flowers, pollen, foliage and  the passage of the days only by odours. Reality for young bees is nothing but  sequences, mixtures and memories of odours. If they communicate with each  other, they must do so in a language of odour or touch.  One day, when about a month old, a bee finds itself with a load of rubbish that  must be thrown outside the hive and there is no experienced bee to take it, so  it approaches the entrance. In his book, Plato suggests that in the first stage  of liberation, the bright light is distressing and nothing is understood from  the unfamiliar visual sensations. Gradually, the young bee will use the familiar  odours to educate the visual system and soon will find that it can detect another  bee or a flower at a distance without relying on the odour. For a time, as Plato  describes, the shadows (odours) appear more real than the visual world. At first,  the bee detects best the motions of contrasts, then the motions and ranges of the  objects themselves, until finally the bee gazes on the blue sky and the sun in the  proper place for that time of day and learns that the sun and the sky move in a  regular way from horizon to horizon.  In Plato’s words, the enlightened bee does not return willingly to the drudgery  within the hive but would rather explore the outside world and return to the  hive loaded with food for the unenlightened ones left behind. So, an education  for new roles is required. As Plato says, to function in the upper world, the  upwardly mobile ‘must use the motion of objects and astronomy’: The spangled heavens must be used as a pattern, with a view to higher  knowledge...The sun will be seen to be the universal author of all things  beautiful and right, parent of light in the visible world, and this is the  power upon which the eyes of the rational are fixed.  Two thousand years later, we have to confess that we know little more than  Plato about the process of the transition of the young bee from the dark world  of odours to the bright world of vision. It seems obvious, however, that the  new visual memories must be correlated at some point with the existing odour  memories. The mushroom bodies in the brain, which are thought to be the  centres of memory, certainly take the majority of their inputs from the odour  pathways, with smaller tracts from the optic lobes (Figure 6.4). It is likely that  the higher-order optic neurons establish connections with the existing higher- 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> WhAT DoES ThE honEyBEE SEE AnD hoW Do WE knoW? level odour centres before the new visual associations can be remembered.  Similarly, the existing gravity detectors of the vertical, which are so essential  for the ordered construction and business of the hive in the dark, are somehow  associated with the new uses of vision to detect the orientation of an edge and  the pattern of the sky and horizon in relation to the sun.
