The first part concentrates on the finding of the Willendorf figurines whereas the second part is dedicated to the time when the Venus from Willendorf was deposited. As to Venus I, the description of raw material probably coming from a Moravian source and the carving traces are discussed in more detail. The contribution also contains a short characteristic of the Figurines II and III. Apart from mentioning the very few sites of this period so far known in Lower Austria, the main focus of the second part is put on the site Grub/Kranawetberg in the area of Stillfried where excavations started in 1993. For its geographical position, chronology and stratigraphy as well as clear differences between cultural layers the site is worth being discussed in a broader regional context. The voluminous assemblage of ivory beads and pendants of Grub/Kranawetberg is also presented. KEY WORDS: Gravettian – Pavlovian – Willendorf figurines – Geography – Ivory  INTRODUCTION Kranawetberg near Stillfried and Ollersdorf/Heidenberg – are situated in the March Valley at a considerable distance In 1908, when the railroad cut through the loess at from Willendorf. A special focus will be put on the new Willendorf II, seven Palaeolithic layers could be excavations at Grub/Kranawetberg which give new insight distinguished at first sight. Josef Szombathy, curator of the to the life at that time. anthropologic-prehistoric collection of the museum as well as Hugo Obermaier and Josef Bayer, then two young scientists, knew at once that this would be an excellent THE WILLENDORF FIGURINES opportunity to study almost the entire cultural development of the Upper Palaeolithic in Central Europe. On August 7, Apart from the incomparable sequence of archaeological 1908 the Venus from Willendorf was found during layers at the site of Willendorf II the most outstanding finds excavations of the Natural History Museum in Vienna. Apart are three figurines from the uppermost layer and the horizon from that the Venus from Willendorf was the best between layer 8 and 9: the well-known Venus I made of documented and best preserved Palaeolithic figurine of that oolithic limestone, the probably unfinished ivory figurine time. Venus II and the so-called Venus III.  Having a look at the time when the Venus was deposited From the stratigraphical point of view only the so-called in Willendorf we find only very few sites in the area of Venus III was found within a layer (layer 9); Venus II was Lower Austria which correspond to this period. One of them deposited in a deep pit, which was attributed by Bayer to is Aggsbach near Willendorf where Bayer made the first layer 9. The famous Venus I was found approximately 25 cm investigations (Bayer 1928).

Finally a sample of time. In spite of some divergences the drawings of the three the collection by Antonín Přichystal from Stránská skála diaries correspond very well. Obermaier’s drawing contains near Brno turned out to be most similar to the material of two horizons and the Venus beneath. Szombathy only saw the Venus I (Binsteiner et al. 2008b). This provenance, although lower horizon at his visit because Bayer and Obermaier had rather far from Willendorf, is quite possible regarding the already dug off layer 9. Therefore he drew only this lower distance to the material sources of erratic flints from horizon.

Summarizing the different working traces on the figurine we can observe a constant overlay of traces from different directions in order to smooth the surface. It seems that the last step of modification should underline the specific character of the worked part: vertical traces at the back and the thighs, horizontal ones at the belly or the breast, the vulva etc. Border lines between individual parts of the body such as arms and breast, breast and belly, belly and thighs were once again deepened by further scratching thus contributing to the plastic impression of the figurine. VENUS II In 1926 Bayer found the Venus II from Willendorf (Figure 7) examining a hole which was dug into the sequence of cultural layers by clandestine excavators. In 1927 he made a systematic excavation on this spot. In the course of this excavation he found the evidence of a deep pit which was dug out from layer 9 down to layer 5. The pit contained bones FIGURE 8. The so-called Venus III.  from mammoth and a mammoth jaw.

This of the brown-coloured cultural layer changing into a horizon first upper layer differs clearly from the main layer by the with scattered finds only. choice of raw materials and the use of personal ornaments. In the area above hearth II the upper layer is also partly divided into two horizons. Radiocarbon dates illustrate that the main layer and the first  upper layer of Grub/Kranawetberg have been deposited shortly one after the other. In 2002 another horizon – the second upper layer – was recognised with scattered artefacts and animal bones a few centimetres above the first upper layer, mainly in the area above hearth II. Among the finds are bone fragments, lithics and adornments. A few scattered lithics and bone fragments were discovered even 50 cm above the main layer. A fragment of a mammoth tusk from G 11 near hearth I could already be part of this third upper layer. Above this horizon there is a marked change of the loess structure.  A correlation between the sedimentation sequences in the northern periphery of the dump zone (B1/B2) and in the west from the dwelling structures (S3 East 1996) suggests that both the dump zone and the main and upper layers of the dwelling area might belong to the same period of occupation (Peticzka, Riegler 2004). The main layer The main layer is characterised by two hearths and a series of pits of different shape. Hearths and pits are dug into the ground from the bottom of the main layer. The main layer and both trough-shaped hearths indicate a repeated use of the site. As to the settlement structures, we can distinguish areas of different activity. In the west there are traces of a dwelling – small pits, hearth. The distribution of lithics west of hearth FIGURE 10.

The lower layer included numerous bone fragments from wild horse, reindeer and a few pieces of mammoth.

Inside the upper layer there were only few artefacts. The whole layer was characterised by traces of fire. Among the finds there was a perforated shell of Glycimeris. About 60 m to the south at the precipice to the Marchfeld a second concentration of finds could be observed. This included only a few artefacts and traces of fire. CONCLUSIONS FIGURE 11. Adornments from the main layer of Grub/Kranawetberg. Willendorf II/layer 9 is one of the oldest horizons attributed to the Willendorf-Kostenkian. As far as shouldered points are concerned we should also mention Aggsbach and Willendorf I collected by Brun and Fischer as well as Willendorf I/North excavated by Bayer (Felgenhauer 1956–1959). The horizon including Venus I was certainly deposited before the occupation of layer 9. For the above-mentioned reasons it is not possible to give a cultural characteristic of this horizon although the style of Venus I is reflected by the Russian figurines. Apart from Aggsbach, Willendorf I, II and Langenlois FIGURE 12. Bird bone with red ochre. there are so far only Grub/Kranawetberg and Ollersdorf/ Heidenberg which were used in this period. Therefore the site of Grub/Kranawetberg is of special interest, because the two phases of occupation are chronologically situated between layers 8 and 9 of Willendorf II. Although they were deposited shortly one after the other, the choice of raw material and that of personal ornaments is completely different in both layers. The geographical position near a river is typical for base camps of the Early Gravettian (Pavlovian) (Svoboda 2000). As far as the main layer is concerned the choice of raw material indicates relations to the Pavlovian sites in Southern Moravia. The arrangement of settlements including numerous pits has, too, parallels in Southern Moravia and at Krems Wachtberg (Händel et al. 2008). Contacts to the east become evident through the piece of obsidian from Slovakian sources. Settlement arrangement and the incidence of finds FIGURE 13.
