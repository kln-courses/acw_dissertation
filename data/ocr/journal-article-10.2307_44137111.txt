<plain_text><page sequence="1">"MAHÄMÄMSA-VIKRAYA" (THE SALE OF HUMAN FLESH) BY S. K. DIKSHIT, M.A. In my "Studies of the Early History of Malwa," Ī came across an interesting religious or sociological problem, which, if studied properly, is likely to shed a flood of light on a number of aspects of ancient Hindu culture. I shall do no more than briefly state the problem and indicate the way to its solution. This pro- blem concerns the sale of human flesh, technically called "Mahā- māmsa- vikraya" in ancient Sanscrit literature. This term occurs in one of the most difficult passages that one meets in the Harsha- . charita. According to this passage, a member of the Tālajangha tribe, dubbed herein as a Vétala (? a whampire, a goblin, or an ethereal being), killed one Kumārasena, who is described as a Jaghanyaja (son or brother ?) of Pradyota, and as a descendant of Puņika or Puņaka (t. e., Pauņika, v. 1. Pauņaki). We are told that the reason of this murder was that this Kumārasena had become too loquacious during the haggling that took place at the sale of Mahāmāmsa, which was being carried out at the time of the festival of Mahākāla1. We are not concerned here with numerous (1) Harsba-charitam, (A. A. Fuhrer'a ed., Bombay, 1909, p. 270 ; K. P.

I. 1. 146, the word "jaghanyaja** is used probably in the sense of "younger*' brother, In the above-given passage, therefore, this word is probably to be under- stood to mean ''younger brother'' and not a "Sudra". ņ »3: i" According to Amarakosa, however, this word means both 'younger brother' and "Antyaja*' or "Sudra'' Vide Amara, II.

"Vetāla", "jaghanyaja" etc. I shall refrain, therefore, from justifying at length the inter- pretation that I have tentatively put here on the Sanskrit passage in the Harsha-charita. Albeit, no interpretation can eschew throw- ing a flood of light on the early religious practices prevalent in Malwa, if not those of India. This passage becomes remarkable, not only because it goes back to the earliest historical period in the history of that province, but also because it shows that the worship of the god Mahākāla in Ujjain belongs to a very high antiquity. Numismatic evidence about the worship of this divinity in the pre-Saka era has been already brought to our notice by emi- nent numismatists, Gen. A. Cunningham, Dr. Allan, and above all by Prof. Jitendra Nath Banerjea. The latter points out that "Siva appears for the first time in an anthropomorphic form on the many coins hailing from Ujjain and its environs. The single standing figure can be definitely identified with him Any doubt whatsoever is set at rest by the testimony of another variety of the same series of coins, which shows a bull slightly prancing up and looking up at the deity (cf. the Matayapurana passage which enjoins that Visākha, the mount of Siva, should be in the attitude of looking up at the god, deva-vikahana-tatparah ),"2 He goes on to point out the existence of a third variety, which depicts a "three-headed" figure. The learned Professor agrees with Gen. Cunningham's identification of it with Mahākāla. and points out that, the heads 01 this divinity probably threw Dr. Allan into confusion, so that he was unable to make up his mind if the god was Siva Mahākāla or Skanda Kãrtikeya.8 He also calls our attention to the existence of a "three-headed" Siva on certain Kushāņa coins,4 While agreeing with this identification, we may point out that these figures of Siva resemble in certain respects the famous seal from Mohenjo-daro representing the "Pasupati Yogisvara" (Siva).® All these depict actually three out of the four heads that this divinity is occasionally credited with. It is only three faces that one can see at one time, of any four-faced figure. Siva, often described as a "Pañchanana"4 i.e. "one endowed 2. Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol. XVI. p. 8. 3. Ibid. 4.

The poet Bāņa-bhatta describes the image of such a ' Chaturmukha Bhagavsn Tryambaka" in his usual beautiful way in his Kādam- barī. 7 The foregoing discussion lends support to the view that the tradition, recorded in the Harsha-charita about the festival of Mahākāla being in vogue in Ujjain as early as the days of Kumārasena, is not unreliable. This tradition occurs in a string of historical allusions ; and it has been found that wherever we are able to check these allusions, we can aver without demur that the poet Bāņaohatta does not invent any fictions and pass them off for historical traditions, but that he probably copies such traditions as he had before him 8 A regular continuity of such traditions is also betrayed by a close study of many of them, from whatever evidence is left for us today. Under these circumstances, to suggest that this particular allusion to the "Mabāmāmsa- vikraya" (or 'the sale of human flesh') may be an outcome of the poet's imagination, is, to say the least, to be hypercritical and unconvincing. That this ancient practice continued to exist throughout the latter half of the first millenium A. D., is vouchsafed by numerous allusions to it in the literature of this period. Besides the reference given above from the Harsha-charita, there is another in that text, which, however, pertains to the days of Bāņabhatta himself 9. The latter reference occurs in connection with the description of the skandhavara (the royal camp), where king Pratāpa-vardhana, father of king Harsha-vardhana was lying on his death-bed.

This passage also refers to the worship of the Mahākāla, as well as to Vétala, here called Āmardaka. There is nothing to support the opinion of certain modern commen- tators that the flesh sold out there was that of the princes them- selves. No doubt, the same passage alludes in a previous sentence probably to certain near and dear relatives etc., of the king Pratāpa-vardhana sacrificing their own flesh at the sacrificial altar. But such sacrifices, which are really relics of a still more bygone age, (when a king's attendants, or kith and kin, used to sacrifice their lives to save his, or to accompany him to the other world), are a different matter. Besides, the very use of the word "prakaśa" in this context suggests that it was not their own flesh that they were selling, but rather somebody else's. If it had been their own flesh, Bāņa-bhatta would not have left it for the commentators to imagine, but would have almost certainly added the word "sva" before the phrases "Mahãmãmsa-vikraya." It would appear that these modern commentators, horrified at the idea of such practices being current at such a late time, tried to gloss over them. That the sale of the "Mahāmāmsa" was one of the ways of propitiating Mahākāla and obtaining from him the fulfilment of one's desire, is made clear also by a famous tale in the Pañcha- tantra. This tale concerns itself with the four sons of a Brāhm- maņa, who wished to do away with their poverty, and one of whom, being too avaricious, got an eternally whirling wheel on his head.10 It is narrated that these four brothers first came to the city of Avanti (or Ujjayim, modern Ujjain, Holkar State), and that after bathing in the river Siprā and saluting the god Mahākāla, they came across an ascetic (or Yogi), by name Bhairavānanda. On being asked the purpose of their journey, they explained that it was undertaken in order to obtain some wealth. They added that for that purpose they were prepared to undertake any task, including the following : 11 "Entering a hole, propitiating a Sãkiní (a Rākshasī-form oí Ambikā), residing in a cemetery, sale of the Mahā-māmsa, (ac- quisition of?) a Sādhaka-varti (or the torch or lamp of a magician?) and (similar) other practices." 10.

We are told that a king of the country of Magadha, who was inordinately fond, of (entering) an Asura- vivara,, was carried away by the ministers of the king of the Mekalas (i.e., the country round, about the Maikal range), through a tunnel of the Godhana-giri (correctly, Goratha-giri). At another place, we find a reference to one Lohitāksha, who accompanied the poet in the journeys of his boyhood and adolescence, and who was also very forid of the "Asura- vivar as."1 3 Besides these, there are a couple of references in the same text to these "holes of the Asuras", in one of which "Asura-vivara-praveśa" is men- tioned as being on a par with "residence in the darkness of the netherworld." 14 It would appear that the phrase "Asura- vivara" refers to underground holes, that were supposed to contain a deal of wealth, guarded by semi-divine beings like the Asuras or Nāgas, from any pilfering hands. In order to obtain such underground wealth, propitiation of these divinities was probably necessary. Other means of obtaining wealth, mentioned in the Paficha-tantra, may likewise signify propitiation of some divinities, or performance of some mystic or mysterious rites connected with them. An illuminating description of the mystic rites, relating to one of these means viz., Mahãmãmsa-vikraya, is contained in the Mālatf-Mādhava. Mādhava, the hero of this drama, despairing of all other means of securing Malati, when she is promised to somebody else, expresses his willingness to take recourse to the Mahā-māmsa-vikraya ; This alone, in his opinion, could secure her for him. 15 In another passage of that drama, Mādhava is described as a seller-to-be of the Mahā-māmsa.14 Further on, we 12.

It is that sort of flesh, formed of the body of a man, which is not cut out by means of a weapon (vqreiÇWT) Commentator Jagaddhara explains that a man, who falls fighting, goes to heaven, so that the flesh of his body cannot be used as "Mahā-māmsa." 18 Jagaddhara is not himself sure about the meaning of the phrase srsraîji - "not cut by a weapon," so that he offers other alternatives also. He quotes a stanza probably from the Tāntric lore, which contains some words found in this passage of the Mālatī-Mādhava. From the drama we learn that the Mahā-māmsa was sold out in the cemetery ( - which is a favourite abode of the god Mahākāla), after loud proclamations. The stanza, quoted by Jagaddhara, supplies the additional information that it was obtained by means of sahasa. What exactly is signified by the latter term is not quite clear, - in spite of its constant use in the stories of Sāhasamka, and others, that are also connected with Vétalas and the Mahākāla-smasāna. 19 Another interesting allusion to "Mahā-māmsa" is to be met with in the Prabodha-chan rodaya of Krishna-miśra-yati. This drama is written in the same spirit as the Mysteries or Miracle Plays of Mediaeval Europe, or the Moralist Plays of Euripides and other Greek writers. A Kāpālika, who professes to be a devotee of "Mahã-bhairava" is represented as communicating his dnarma (or religious tenets) to a Kshapaņaka in the following frightful words : - 4,Our breaking off of a fast is achieved by (means of) drinking the wine off (a goblet, in the form of) a skull of a Brāhmaņa, after (finishing the sacrifice, in which) we have poured oblations of the Mahā-māmsa (human flesh) that is made 17.

Here the reference is not to the sale of the Mahāmāmsa, but to the sacrifice thereof. The whole incident depicted in the Prabodha chandro- daya reminds us of a verse in the Pañcha-tantra, which stigmatises the foolishness of the people, that is so easily swayed by rumours or reports that poison the ears, as to make one turn recluse (Kshapaņaka) or drink wine*1. While this stigmatisation is worth remembering to-day, when the sacrifice of "Mahā- māmsa" is being witnessed in a different sphere and in a larger scale, than the devotees of Mahākāla were ever able to perform, we must also take note of the fact that there are at least some religious and secular texts that prohibited "Mahā-māmsa-vikraya," or even ordinary 'mãmsa-vikraya." The Mahãbhãshya of Patañ- jali contains what appears to be a quotation from some early Dharma-ģāstra text. This lays down that no flesh should be sold. Perhaps, such an injunction was to be followed only by the Brāhmaņas, or it was meant for the members of the three upper castes23. Be that as it may, we find the author of the Kautiliya Arthaśastra objecting to the sale of putrified flesh, - or, per- haps, of the goat's flesh - for which he recommends a heavy amercement of 900 paņas, 33 etc. Immediately after this the author of the Kautiliya Artha-sāstra adds that the sale of human flesh be punished with nothing less than capital punishment. We are to-day not concerned with meting out of such punishments to such criminals, but rather with their religious or sociological significance. As we have made it clear at the very outset, we shall only point the way towards its solution. We may draw the attention of the scholars in this field to the following passage from the "Golden Bough" of Sir J. G. Frazer, reminding them at the same time that in our work, entitled 'The Mother Goddess" we have had an occasion to point out the 'identification of (or at any rate numerous points of similarity between) Dionysius and Siva or Mahākāla : "Meantime it remains 20.

This was the practice in Chios and Tenedos ; and at Potniae in Bœotia the tradition ran that it had been formerly the custom to sacrifice in the goat-smiting Dionysus a child, for whom a goat was after- wards substituted. At Orohomenus, as we have seen, the human victim was taken from the women of an old royal family. As the slain bull or goat represented the slain god, so, we may sup- pose, the human victim also represented him."24 . 24. The Golden Bough, Pt. I, Vol. I. p. 24 (1912, London).</page></plain_text>
