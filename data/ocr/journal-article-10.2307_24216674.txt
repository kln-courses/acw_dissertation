<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rivka Horwitz HAMANN AND ROSENZWEIG ON LANGUAGE — THE REVIVAL OF MYTH Introduction Heschel said: "We shall never be able to understand that spirit is revealed in the form of words unless we discover the vital truth that spirit is power, that is commitments."1. This understanding of words is the theme we are seeking both in the works of Johann Georg Hamann (1730-1788) and Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929). For them both language is not an agreement among human beings but an inner property of a symbolic nature within the human being himself. Their understanding of language is in opposition to the abstract objective approach of rationalism that understood language as a means for a pragmatic goal. It is a theory of language which rejects panlogism, be it in form of Plato or Aristotle, Maimonides, Leibniz or Hegel. For Rosenzweig and Hamann language is primary and for the rationalists thought is. Thoughts can fly, be objective, be all-inclusive, deal with the essential, whereas language is time bound and has to rely on words, each with its own expression and history. It is spoken in a personal situation, emphasizes that which cannot be part of the general, relies on the other and his approach; it is a dialogue rather than an objective statement. Language speaks in the voice of the particular person expressing himself with lively intonations, in his own unique handwriting. In short, it wishes to convey that which rational philosophy left out; it is this which becomes the cornerstone of their anti-rationalist philosophy. * I delivered this paper in German on May 1995 as a Rosenzweig Professor at the Gesamthochschule in Kassel. 1 Abraham Joshua Heschel, Man's Quest for God, New York, 1954, p. 25.</page><page sequence="2">VI Rivka Horwitz Literature rather than logic or mathematics, the spoken word rather than the written, the personal letter and rather than the advertisement, the individual that is suffocated by the universal becomes the theme of concern and gains importance. Both Hamann and Rosenzweig rejected the idea that reason is all inclusive, that all can be understood by reason and that it can solve all human problems. Just as Hamann stood against the rational philosophy of the Enlightenment, Rosenzweig stood against that of idealism. Ernst Cassirer in his "The Philosophy of the Enlightenment"2 describes the beginning of the 18th century in the following manner: "The eighteenth century is imbued with a belief in the unity and the immutability of reason. Reason is the same for all thinking subjects, all nations, all epochs, and all cultures. From the changeability of religious creeds, of moral maxims and convictions, of theoretical opinions and judgements, a firm and lasting element can be extracted which is permanent in itself and which in this identity and permanence expresses the real essence of reason." For Hamann as a disciple and critic of the Enlightenment, and as a predecessor of Kierkegaard, reason is understood differently. It is not that upon which everything relies; it is secondary, preceded by the senses, the historical, and that which is bound to the particular situation. Reason, Hamann thought, is not immutable; it may be influenced by time and place, and darkened by lusts and sin.3 There is no general type of reason common to all human beings. As he wrote in a letter,4 "The idea of a healthy common sense [meaning an all-inclusive reason] is the cheapest and most arbitrary and most shameless self glory, which presupposes that which has to be proved." Hamann rejects the admiration of reason and wrote5: "The object of your opinions and devotion is not God but Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of the Enlightenment, Boston, 1955, p. 6.

For Rosenzweig the living speech is an element in his argument against idealism, he calls their thinking6 "mute". In a letter to Hans Ehrenberg of September 4th 1918, one of the only documents where Rosenzweig realized how close he was to Herder and Hamann, he wrote7 "it was a symptom of the illness of the German idealism that on the one hand they did not develop a philosophy of language — compare Hamann's and Herder's critic of Kant — and on the other hand they erected a special aesthetic." When Rosenzweig at a mature age wished to define his controversy with Hegel, he called his own theory "speech thinking". While Hegel begins with thinking that is not bound to anything concrete, Rosenzweig starts out with thinking that is tied to words and to people who speak these words. Just as Hamann questions Kant as to whether one can really purify reason of all experience and deal with contentless reason, Rosenzweig questions the assumption that abstract thinking can exist without words.8 Rosenzweig wrote: "The new thinking is the method of speech that replaces the method of thinking in all earlier philosophies. Thinking is timeless and wants to be timeless. With one stroke it would establish thousands of connections. It regards the last, the goal, as the first. Speech is bound to time and nourished by time, and it neither can, nor wants to abandon this element. It does not know in advance just where it will end. It takes its cues from the others. In fact, it lives by virtue of another's life,... while thinking is always a solitary business, even when it is done in common by several who philosophize together...and this is the reason why the great majority of philosophic dialogues — including most of Plato's are so tedious... . For the thinker knows his thoughts in advance".9 For Rosenzweig, as we shall see, the main discovery of his speech thinking is related to the dialogue, therefore it is so central in his philosophy. For Hamann, however, the dialogue, in the sense Rosenzweig understood it, played no particular role, so in this they differed considerably. It follows that there is also a resemblance between Hamann and Rosenzweig in terms of their theories of knowledge; both are empiricists and nominalists Franz Rosenzweig, Der Stern der Erlosung, Frankfurt, 1993, II, 121; English translation, W.

Whereas Plato's philosophy claims that the reliance on sense perception as the source for the real is dubious, as the senses are deceiving and the truth is founded on the logical, the mathematical, the eternal idea, for Hamann and Rosenzweig the truth is Here and Now. Sense perception does not deceive us. The real is in this world. Hamann relies on Hume and the Bible to find his point of departure. Hamann thought that the idea that reason is a priori and knowledge stems from reason is appalling. He read Hume with great interest. Though Hume was an unbeliever, Hamann thought nevertheless that God spoke the truth through him. He wrote, "Hume is always my man"10 The Dialogues concerning Natural Religion are "full of poetic beauty" and not "dangerous at all".11 He asks: If belief is needed for eating and drinking, why does Hume break his own principle when judging of things higher than eating and drinking?12 For Hamann all wisdom begins with sense; wisdom is feeling. "The existence of the smallest things rests on immediate impression, and not on ratiocination".13 Faith is then the basis of knowledge of the external world and with this conviction Hamann sought to destroy traditional rationalism. Hamann also considered the influence of the metabolism on one's thinking.14 He wrote, "The senses relate to the understanding as the stomach to the vessels which secrete the finer and higher juices of the blood.... Nothing therefore is in our understanding without having been previously in our senses: as there is nothing in our entire bodies that has not come through either our stomach or our parents. The stamen and menstruation of our reason are therefore in the truest sense revelation and tradition". This quotation is very interesting in its organic conception of spiritual life. Speech needs past generations and it develops itself by the interpretation of ancient foregone cultures. This idea is close to Rosenzweig. Tradition is the interpretation of the past and revelation is God's appearance in nature and the Bible. Nature can also be understood by revelation. What we see and hear is directly given. The human being is not a passive receptacle, but active and dependent on his society. Hamann turns Hume's Isaiah Berlin, The Magus of the North, J.G.

He also uses empiricism to criticize rationalism and idealism and sought a theory that depends on what he called common sense (though it has nothing to do with Thomas Reid's classic theory of common sense). The senses, Rosenzweig thought, are reliable and inquiry into the essence is the error of traditional philosophy. He wrote16, "Philosophy [meaning idealism] has always inquired into the "essence" of things. This is the concern that marks it off from the unphilosophical thinking of sound common sense, which never bothers to ask what a thing "actually'5 is. Common sense is content to know that a chair is a chair, and is unconcerned that it may actually be something quite different.... In its effort to "reduce" the essence of one thing back to the essence of another, philosophy continues, tirelessly, to work out all possible permutations". At one point he suggests to call his new system even "absolute empiricism".17 Earlier he develops this theme in his book Understanding the Sick and the Healthy.18 Glatzer, when he published it, thought to clarify Rosenzweig's understanding of common sense by quoting a letter he wrote to his mother when he worked on this book. It reads19: "The chief thing is not whether a person 'believes' in the 'good Lord'; what matters is that he opens all his five senses and sees the facts — at the risk that even the good Lord may be found among the facts." It is astonishing that one finds a striking resemblance in many major themes between Hamann and Rosenzweig, yet we find very few references to Hamann in his writings though he tended not to hide his sources. The answer must be that many of Hamann's ideas penetrated indirectly orally into Rosenzweig's thought. He was very receptive to them when, as an adult, he chose to take his Judaism seriously. Rosenzweig, a Jew of the beginning of the twentieth century, raised in the idealistic liberal circles of German culture, received a limited Jewish education and almost turned to Christianity like some of his friends.

He learned a great deal from this brilliant, complicated, spiritually forceful person who was considered the second Magus of the North" and who opened to Rosenzweig new gates to religion and language. Paradoxically, Rosenstock Huessy, the converted Jew, led Rosenzweig back to Judaism!. Rosenzweig drank from this cup he received and enriched his Judaism by this romantic fountain of Hamann of which Rosenstock-Huessy was filled. Rosenzweig had received enough to be able to have a foundation for reappropriating the faith of his fathers. It is this trail that we wish to follow. Johann Georg Hamann, known as the "Magus of the North", is one of the most influential yet enigmatic figures in the history of German thought. A Protestant follower of Luther in an unorthodox way belonged to the Sturm und Drang group which demanded that one consider that religion has its foundation in poetry and sensuous language. His writings are very complicated. Walter Lowrie wrote about his reading the Magus20; "I was prepared to delve, but had not expected to find the digging so hard". Hamann was an important source of Rosenstock-Huessy^ theory of language. Rosenstock-Huessy does mention Hamann and the relationship between them awaits still a serious study. It is known that the relationship between Rosenzweig and Rosenstock-Huessy, were intense; they had daily existential and philosophical conversations that were not recorded, so we have only partial documentation in their letters; Rosenzweig also wrote21: "A full year and a half before I began to write [The Star of Redemption], I had seen the rough draft of his [meaning Rosenstock-Huessys's] now published Angewandte Seelenkunde". Rosenzweig confesses that he not only borrowed from but "plundered" this book. Hamann's ideas on language, its importance and its primacy may have reached Rosenzweig this way. Clues for my statement can be documented by a deeper study of the correspondence, but this is beyond the scope of this essay. When I wrote my dissertation on Rosenzweig, I went to visit Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy in May 1961. He himself, a fiery person who spoke in aphorisms and resembled Hamann in his manner, mentioned Hamann numerous times during the days I stayed with him. This approach also fits the outlook of Harold Stahmer, an important disciple of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, and the way he presented 20 Walter Lowrie is quoted by James C. Ο'Flaherty, Johann Georg Hamann, Boston, 1979, p. 167. 21 Glatzer, F.

Myth and the Bible In our study one has to go one step further and see that for these scholars, language was not only a force but of divine origin. The Bible also played a great role in each of their return to faith and in their religious belief. Hamann and Rosenzweig, in their way of interpreting the Bible, put emphasis on the senses, on hearing and seeing. Rosenzweig wrote:23 "The human word is symbol" (Sinnbild) and he spoke of theomorphism meaning that human love or sight is divine. For Hamann, the human being's spiritual life starts with poetry and passion; he stresses the emotions. Language is symbol using; images come before words and are created by passions. Hamann in "Aesthetica in Nuce" thinks that the concrete and the individual has priority over the refined and the systematic. For him parables, pictures and poetry are truly prior to abstraction, concepts, deductions. Poetry is not a derivative form of language nor sophisticated refinement, it is our most basic way of perceiving and communicating — our mother tongue.24 Hamann trusts the words of the Bible as vessels of the Divine Spirit as we find in the writings of Rosenzweig as well. Hamann wrote25: "Poetry is the mother tongue of the human race; as gardening is older than farming; painting — than writing; song, — than declamation: parables — than arguments; bartering — than commerce". In terms of hermeneutics Hamann, under certain aspects suggests that there should be no difference between pagan and biblical writings pagan speak also of a prophetically voice as for example Socrates did. Generally speaking in the Christian tradition, where pagan poetry played a significant role, and in the western tradition familiar with Homer and other ancient Greek and Roman poetry, there was more openness to see the Bible as poetry. But for Hamann the discovery of myth and poetry in the Bible is related to his an anti-rationalistic tendency; for him God is not a mathematician but a poet! Rosenzweig deals with the question of whether the Bible is prose or poetry in his article "Das Formgeheimnis der biblischen Erzahlungen He thinks that the question whether the Bible is of religious content or aesthetic form, poetry or 22 Harold Stahmer, Speak that I may see Thee, New York, 1968; the headline on p. 106 is: J.

Rosenzweig apparently does not believe — as Hamann — that the deepest layer of the soul is solely poetry. Myth could also be expressed in prose. Rosenzweig presents a more involved picture: in the Bible one finds poetry which is prose and prose which is poetry, it is not a matter of either or. The article mentioned, gives numerous examples in this line. Furthermore in the Bible one finds26 that "revealed message and commanded teaching are inseparable". Rosenzweig's statement is more in the line of a Jewish traditional answer. Aesthetics fulfills a much more limited task. Hamann spoke of "natural language," meaning biblical language, in opposition to "abstract language," the language of philosophy. His general valuation of sensuous figurative Biblical language in opposition to abstract philosophical language is important. They both accept myth as a stage prior to biblical thinking and they enrich their theory much by this approach. They interpret the Bible as the word of God but not in a naive sense. Hamann's interpreters call it typological, the way from promise to fulfillment. Their method of exegesis rejects mystical or rational allegory on the one hand and their attitude to historical critic is ambivalent. Rosenzweig sought the oral word between God and the human being that preceded the written document. They both relied on an understanding of the Bible and by living with the Bible in one's community of believers, between creation and redemption. For them, myth exists in Biblical thinking. Hamann admired the myth of classical antiquity. Mythology, indeed, is more valuable than the de mythologized Enlightenment religions. The root of poetry and theology are in myth; so poetry and theology will wither if severed from it. At one point, Hamann gives the example of Narcissus who loved his own image and explains that this is not simply a myth of the past but belongs to the present, it tells us about ourselves. He wrote: "So do not venture into the metaphysics of the fine arts without being initiated into the orgies and Eleusinian mysteries. But the senses are, however, Ceres and Bacchus, the passions; — ancient foster-parents of beautiful nature"27. In one of his earliest writings28, he created a myth on the philosophy of history comparing it to a statute of Richilieu. A great artist turns his chisel to it, the 26 F.

Various interpreters of Hamann have given different meaning to this allegory. Some thought it wished to convey that history is a display of the genius, other thought it is a display of one's power, and a third approach is to see history as an oracle. What is clear is that this myth demands a living engagement with the past. History cannot be merely deduced as a result of given conditions based on a system that has no presuppositions. Hamann thinks that history, certainly Biblical history, should be understood as mythology and interpreted by means additional to reason; it cannot be exhausted by reason. His approach is an assault on the Enlightenment and their tendency to what we would call demythologizing and the refusal to understand the supernatural. Hamann warns also against excessive veneration of the Greeks; he rejects Lessing and Diderot's worship of the Greeks as their models, because their tendency appeared to him directed too much towards paganism; he himself preferred the saying of Paul (in the Romans 11,25) that "salvation comes from the Jews" meaning the kernel of Christianity comes from Christ.29 Rosenzweig approach is quite different yet for him too, myths are not done away with just because they belong to the past. The myths belong to the present as much as they belong to the past. Myth is an elementary truth beneath biblical faith; it is always there. He wrote30 "Paganism is not indeed the mere bugbear that philosophers of religion make use of to terrorize adults, a role in which the orthodoxy of former centuries cast it. Paganism is no more, no less than truth itself, but truth reduced to its elements, invisible and unrevealed truth. So that whenever paganism sets out to represent the whole instead of an element, the form of the invisible, revelation instead of the unrevealed, it becomes a lie. But as an element and the unrevealed contained in the whole, the visible, the revealed, it is everlasting". The whole first volume of "Star of Redemption" describes it in more detail. Their interest in myth becomes conspicuous in Buber and Rosenzweig's work on the translation of the Bible. Rosenzweig particularly sought in his share in the Bible translation, the concrete, the anthropomorphic, rather than the spiritual and the abstract. Just as Onkelos is an example of expressing through translation a demythologizing tendency, Buber and particularly Rosenzweig discover in their translation the ancient mythical element.

Rosenzweig — His Life and Thought, p. 195; Das neue Denken, Kleinere Schriften, 382.</page><page sequence="10">XIV Rivka Horwitz studied this matter in the Martin Buber Archive and presented her conclusion in a recent work on the Buber-Rosenzweig Bible translation. One striking example highlights this tendency. When Buber prepared the first draft of the translation of Gen. 1.2 "Ve Ruah Elohim Merahefet al Pene Ha-Mayim", he wrote31 "Und Gottes Geist briiteteauf den Wassern". Buber at the start translated, 'Ruah Elohim' as 'Geist Gottes'.32 In a later essay Buber thinks that the opinions on 'ruah5 are divided; some say it is wind and others say it is spirit. Luther first said it is wind and then that it is spirit. Spinoza thought that God is neither nature nor spirit, but the source of both. Buber thought that one has to feel in the translation of'ruah'how the spiritual and the natural act of God depend one on the other. The original translation of Buber's "Geist Gottes "roused a strong reaction in Rosenzweig's mind, because of Platonic, Hegelian or Christian associations. Indeed Eugen Rosenstock Huessy remembers a conversation in 1913 with33 Rosenzweig and his having a deep aversion to the so called Christians who were merely Greeks. He read with abhorrence in the New Testament that God is spirit (Geist) because he saw how this sentence leads to platonic heresy. They conclude: Spirit is God, our spirit is God, our ideals are God etc. Niehoff, who identifies with the idealists, writes34: "It is furthermore of special interest that Buber's first translation of Ruah is 'spirit'; in this case it is particularly obvious that he remains within both Jewish and Christian traditions of translation. Doubts arise in the authors only at a later stage, when at Rosenzweig's insistence they search for a distinctly non-Christian approach. 'Spirit' is thus initially replaced by 'breath'. This choice is substantiated by Konig's, Jacob's and Fiirst's commentaries, and anticipated by Hirsch's integration of such an exegesis into translation ('Gottes-OdemBuber and Rosenzweig saw that the translation of breath does not fit the end of the verse namely to briitete or brooding. Hence they continued searching and after more negotiations between Buber and Rosenzweig, verse 1,2 was published in the following manner: "Braus Gottes spreitend iiber den Antlitz der Wasser. "So the After Rosenzweig's death Buber returned to an earlier version of his translation, hence in the final edition before Buber's death this verse reads: "Braus Gottes schwingend iiber den Antlitz des Wasser".

Niehoff discovered romantic influences on Rosenzweig, but she did not see the connection with Hamann, only with Herder. She published a few lines of the prospectus of their translation where the emphasis on the romantic formulation is evident. They planned to present35: "Die Bibel in der kosmischen Tiefe ihres Sinngehalts. Die Bibel im inneren Rhythmus der hebrdischen Urform. Die Bibel in der grossten Treue gegen den Wortlaut She shows36 that Rosenzweig rejects a translation because "of its insufficient sensuality ,י. "In the same vein, he admires some of Luther's renderings, which he finds extremely visual". "The reader should thus come to identify with the emotions of the biblical figures". She concludes that "their frame of reference ..[is] primitive sensuality as opposed to cultivated abstraction". Niehoff continues,37 "Buber... delights in his translation 'the breath of God brooding'" (Gen. 1, 2) because it represents [as he wrote in an unpublished letter to Rosenzweig RH] a "holy union of two Versinnlichungen, which are however not invented by us, but are compelling present in the Ursinn of the text". Niehoff discovered too that Grimm's dictionary was a major source for their work. In an effort to judaize Grimm, it was jokingly called Reb Grimm. Niehoff sees38 an affinity of the Buber-Rosenzweig translation and particularly the first chapter of Genesis to Herder's work and his book "The Spirit of Hebrew Poetry". Here I would suggest that one must be more careful, because in the major work of Rosenzweig, "The Star of Redemption" there is to be found a critical approach to Herder, and as is known Herder and Hamann had often important disagreements. Rosenzweig sees in Herder the beginning of secular Bible interpretation, meaning the exclusion of God from the world. Herder, like Goethe, Rosenzweig claims, sees in the Song of Songs a collection of "worldly "love lyrics, implying, that God cannot love! Rosenzweig may share with Herder an interest in sensual poetry and pictorial presentation, an openness to myth and symbols, but not with Herder's view on the Enlightenment. The popularity of Herder in Jewish circles certainly was no factor for Rosenzweig. He certainly dared to stand up against it. Maurice Olender in his work "The Language of Paradise, Race, Religion and Philology in the Nineteenth Century"39 points to another important factor in Ibid, p. 269-270. Ibid, p. 272-273.

Olender shows that in the post-Herder period one finds in Germany a decline in interest in the Hebrew as the source of Christianity and an attempt by the Germans to distance their culture from its biblical springs and rather found it on Sanskrit and Hindu-European culture. Language Two acquaintances of Rosenzweig who also got interested in Hamann should be mentioned. The first is the literary critic Walter Benjamin, who already in 1917, before Rosenzweig wrote "The Star of Redemption" and before Benjamin met Rosenzweig, wrote a brilliant article relating to Hamann's theory of language "Ober die Sprache iiberhaupt und iiber die Sprache des Menschen"40. The second person is Gershom Scholem, a close friend of Benjamin and the founder of the modern study of Kabbala, whose interest in philosophy of language was linked with his interests in Jewish mysticism; he too had a great appreciation for Hamann. That admirable article of Benjamin on language was written as a letter to Scholem and it also expresses much of ScholenTs own thoughts and the debates they had held on the subject. Scholem even relates41 that a plan existed to write a second part to that essay that would deal with symbolic language and the language as signs and its relation to the script which should finally lead to the relation between mathematics and religion. But that second part never materialized. As Scholem saw that first part of "Die Sprache iiberhaupt und die Sprache des Menschens "aimed to construct a spiritual theory of language which rejects the prevailing philosophies. The second part deals with the results of this theory and addresses specific problems such as the language of God and revelation as it appears in the Bible and the problem of names and the source of abstractions. Scholem thought that this second part was excellent. Most intresting for Scholem was the question of the Fall of language and the way in which it took place. One sees that there is an extremely close relation between Scholem and Benjamin with regard to this essay. Scholem attempted translate it into Hebrew, Walter Benjamin, Ober die Sprache iiberhaupt und liber die Sprache des Menschen"; Walter Benjamin, Gesammelte Schriften, unter Mitwirkung von Theodor W.

It no doubt expressed for Benjamin and Scholem their understanding of themselves as Jews and the interpretation of Judaism as a foundation of a theory of language in general. Scholem returns to the theme later in his article "The Name of God and the Linguistic theory of the Kabbala" where he42 quotes Benjamin and also from Hamann the saying43: "Language — the mother of Reason and Revelation, their Alpha and Omega". He thinks that it is the laconic fundamental thesis of mystical language. Scholem in his article deals too with language in a profound manner. For him language is not a result of consent but some inner power of symbolic nature in the human being himself. The mystics diverge in their interpretation of that symbol; they agree, however, that language wishes to communicate something beyond the possibility of communicating. This mystical language is either in the domain of religion or in that of aesthetics. However, though mystics often discover the language of God as the language of revelation, the most difficult question is, how does God's language infiltrate human language? Is there no abyss between the two? One senses that language should be both language of revelation and language of reason. This is, he thinks, indicated by Hamann's above mentioned great saying, "Language — the mother of reason and revelation, their Alpha and Omega"44. This presentation of Scholem applies also to the question we are dealing with here. Interpreters of Hamann generally would not classify Hamann as a mystic as Scholem did. They would, however, agree with Scholem's general description. Hamann, Benjamin and Rosenzweig share their confirmation of the Biblical transcendent God. They agree about a non pantheistic tendency. Hamann recognized God as creator in the biblical sense and avoided the pantheism that was so much liked by the romantics. For Hamann as for Rosenzweig, God is never immanent in nature. Hamann wrote45 Der Name Gottes und die Sprachtheorie der Kabbala, Judaica 3, Frankfurt, 1970, p. 7-10. English translation, Diogenes 79, 1972, p. 59-63.

On account of the question posed by the Berlin Academy on the origin of language and the fact that Herdefs prize winning essay brought a strong reaction of Hamann, we are in the possession of his view</page><page sequence="14">XVIII Rivka Horwitz "Adam therefore was God's; and God himself introduced the first-born and oldest of our race as the supporter and heir of the world which was prepared by the word of His mouth.... Every phenomenon of nature was a word — the sign, symbol, and pledge of a new inexpressible, but all the more intimate union, communication, and community of divine energy and ideas. Everything the human being heard from the beginning, saw with his eyes, looked upon and touched with his hands was a living word; for God was the word. With this word in mouth and heart, the origin of language was as natural, as near, and as easy as child's play". Hamann claims that language is divinely derived. For him creation is also revelation and both depend on language. The myth described here is that Adam was surrounded by language, for everything is word. The first speech of Adam is not a rational exercise but a reaction to the surrounding. The human language to start with is an answer to the surrounding nature which is word. Speech is not a rational speech, is not a one to one dialogue, but is more like the speech of the baby to the surrounding. For Hamann, the quote from Psalm 19 is also a landmark, "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork; Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night revealeth knowledge". Sometimes Hamann thinks that man never knows God apart from nature, and nature too is a book in which God reveals His word to human beings, but it still needs human interpretation because46 "in nature we have only jumbles of verse and disjecti membra poetae It is humanity's taks to order, to interpret and to give direction. There are, however, times when Hamann discovers other modes in which God speaks to us as well. He writes47: "The opinions of the philosophers are readings of nature, and the dogmas of the theologians readings of Scripture. The author [God] is the best interpreter of his words; he may speak through creatures, through events, or through blood, fire and vapor and smoke, of which language of the sanctuary consists. The book of creation contains examples of universal concepts which God desired to reveal to the creature through creature; the books of the covenant contain examples of secret articles which God desired to reveal man through man. The unity of the author (Urheber) is reflected in the very dialect of his works; in all of them was an immeasurable height and depth!" Hamann's term 'book of creation' is a figurative expression for finding God in nature, history and revelation. The 'book of covenant' mentioned here refers to on the origin of language and most of the material quoted is from this controversy. His view is not simplistic and unlike Silsmilch is not founded on rationalism. 46 Hamann GGD, Aesthetica in Nuce, Ν, II, 198, 34, p. 412. 47 Hamann GGD, 203-204, p. 417-418.</page><page sequence="15">Hamann and Rosenzweig on Language — The Revival of Myth XIX the Bible; he shifts from a figurative use of the book to a literal one. Hamann is against the understanding of nature in the ways of modern science. He would not have accepted an interpretation in a geometric way, or as a mechanistic causality as Newton had conceived it, relegating God to a position of a watchmaker. He also writes in "Aesthetica in Nuce" against the critical, historical biblical interpretation of Michaelis who recognized God only in miracles. G. G. Dickson explains his position, writing: "The difference between Hamann and Michaelis is in their answers to the question: who is the Author? And how does he speak? Does God, as Michaelis maintained, speak only through miracles, in which all other causal factors or agancy can be discounted or through all human factors, all creatures all authors, all events in history as well?"48 For Rosenzweig too all of nature is creation. God is the source of nature and language. Human beings have to perceive that language precedes us, it is something given and not invented or just agreed upon. The beginning of language is divine. He wrote49 "For language, [Sprache] is truly mankind's morning gift from the Creator, and yet at the same time it is the common property of all the children of man, in which each has his particular share". Creation is for Rosenzweig not an event that occurred once in the beginning, but the ever present renewal of the world. It precedes every human being wherever he is born. Hamann speaks of the call of creation,50 as a call that "ranges over every climate to the end of the world and in every dialect its voice is heard". The call of God is universal. It precedes the biblical faith, because it is a call to all, believers and pagans in all languages and all dialects. The description of the beginnings of language is sometimes different from the biblical story of one Adamite language in the beginning. Rosenzweig thought that the unity of language is a hope for redemption; he wrote51 "the human being became a human being when he first spoke. And yet to this day there is no language of mankind; that will only come at the end". It is noteworthy that the priority of the Hebrew tongue, the original language of the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible in which many passages are obviously clearer than in translation, played no role in Rosenzweig's philosophy of language that stresses the universality of the Bible for mankind, and the 48 GGD in her exposition, p. 107-108.

He wrote:52 "All languages are virtually one. There is no trait in any one language which is not at least latent in the other." As we have shown the issue for him was the importance of a philosophy of language contra an idealistic rational thought. The Polish Jesuit scholar Adam Zack, who has recently examined the connection between Hamann and Rosenzweig in his book on Rosenzweig, writes, however, with astonishment that Rosenzweig lacks any national pride regarding the Hebrew tongue53. In relation to his philosophical outlook Zack is right, however, there is also another aspect to Rosenzweig's thought, I mean the Jewish inwardness. In his chapter on Judaism in "The Star" he deals with Hebrew as the holy eternal tongue of the Jews and later in his life he wrote an extremely important article "Neuhebraisch "where he shows that despite its holiness the Hebrew tongue remained always alive and contains many historical layers.54 Hamann, on the other hand, shows interest in the Hebrew tongue and the Bible writing to the Bible scholar Michaelis: "You do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God, neither its inspiration nor its interpretation, which is not dependent on philosophical causes"55 and adds: "Even though the Hebrew language be as dead as the womb of Sarah, it can still be as miraculously fruitful as that wife of the patriarch when past the age of childbearing".56 He thought that the Hebrew can be revived. He was eager to find the cradle of the Christian religion in the Orient. For Hamann, Buber and Rosenzweig the process of revelation involves an interaction between the human and the divine. Hamann demands that language be seen as divine but also affirms the legitimacy and importance of having human interpretation. He wrote,57 "Everything divine is also human... this communication of the divine and human idiomatum is the fundamental law and primary key to all our cognition". Hamann wishes to say that the question whether Speech is human or divine, as scholars put it, is of no consequence. If God speaks to human beings He speaks in human words. Interpretation become one of the most important categories of Hamann's thought. In contrast with copying the original one rather gives a subjective meaning to reality.

But revelation does not pour itself into the world through him who receives it as through a funnel... The man who is the "mouth" of the revelation is indeed this not a speaking-tube [not a mouthpiece] or any kind of instrument, but an organ which sounds according to its own laws; and to sound means to modify." (lauten heisst umlauteri) Rosenzweig expresses this same thought of language being both divine and human in the following key sentence59: "What the human being hears in his heart as his own language (or speech, Sprache) is the very word which comes out of God's mouth... that word of creation which reverberates within us and speaks from within us-all; this is also the word which God has spoken and which we find inscribed in the Book of the Beginning in Genesis". The word within every human soul is God's word that is inscribed in us and in the Scriptures and needs us humans to interpret it. The importance of interpretation can also be found in Rosenzweig's consideration of Jewish tradition; there are endless ways of interpreting the Tora and each one of us is a son and a builder.60 Rosenzweig in his theory of language wishes to support his interest in the dialogue; therefore speech is for him primarily related to revelation and creation is only the foundation of it. He wrote61 "language...all created from the beginning, nevertheless awakes to real vitality only in revelation." Naming Hamann, Benjamin and Rosenzweig also addressed the problem of naming. For Benjamin, God's language is the highest of all language, alluding to the existence of different types of languages, a hierarchy of languages and especially one divine and one human. He even speaks of a language of a lamp or other objects, suggesting that there is a linguistic reality (Weseri) to inanimate things; for if they would not relate to the human being, he would not have been able to name them. Benjamin may have come across or been inspired by the saying of Martin Buber, I and Thou, translated by Ronald Gregor Smith, New York, 1958, p. 117; Original German: Ich und Du, Das dialogische Prinzip, Gerlingen, 1992, p. 118. Der Stern, II, 168; The Star, p. 151. This idea was developed by Rosenzweig in his article "The Builders", in: On Jewish Learning, ed. by Ν. N. Glatzer, New York, 1955, p. 72-92; Die Bauleute, Kleinere Schriften, pp. 106-121. See also, Der Stern, III, p. 48-49; The Star, p. 298-299.

Benjamin wrote63: "In God the name is creative (schopferisch) because it is word and God's Word is cognizant because it is name. 'And God saw, that it was good'; that is: He had cognized it through the name. The absolute relation of name to knowledge exists only in God, only there is name, because it is most inwardly identical with the creative word, the pure medium of knowledge. That means, God made things knowledgable by their names. Man, however, names according to his limited knowledge." Benjamin attributes a central role to the close relation between creating and language. He notes the rhythm of Genesis 1, "Let there be" "He made", "He called" (named), that shows affinity between creating and naming. Adam's ability to name he shares with God. Again an idea one finds in Hamann. As Benjamin observes, God did not create Adam by the word and he did not name him [Adam].64 The Fall of man marks the birth of the human word; from then the name no longer lived uninjured; That the language must communicate something other than itself is really Fall. Benjamin speaks in this context of the prattle mentioned in Kierkegard's writings which is a parody of language.65 Benjamin sees a kind of Neoplatonic or even Gnostic decline in the development of language, a matter which may have been meaningful to Scholem. One finds in Hamann a different metaphysical attitude. On the task of the human being, he wrote,66: "Every creature will alternately become your sacrificial offering and your idol. Subjected against its will — but still in hope — it sighs under its servitude or over vanity;... it longs for that freedom in which the animals honored Adam, when God brought them to him to see what he would call them, for whatever he named them, they would be called." Hamann speaks here of the human naming and it appears as though God depends on human reception as He made man responsible for nature. The perfect God accepts our limitations in the naming. He is transcendent but he has also chosen to put Himself at the mercy of human response. Adam is different from the animals by the capacity of having a language, by naming.

Naming for Hamann as for Benjamin is analogous to creating by the word of the mouth. Language establishes a relationship. Herein lies our likeness to God. And on the other hand there is no access to reality apart of language. In Rosenzweig's thought naming fulfills still a different task. His philosophy is built on a dichotomy between thought and faith and the interplay between them, with priority again given to faith and thought playing a secondary role. The naming of Adam presents the kind, the category and the genus, which is in contrast to the individual. He wrote67 "with the proper name, the rigid wall of objectness (Dinghaftigkeit) has been breached.... Adam names the creatures, as they step before him in creation, by categories and not as individuals. And he names them himself, thus only expressing his demand for names. The demand still remains unfulfilled, for the names ... are not such as he himself might give; rather, they are names which are revealed to him like his own name, names to secure a firm basis for the individuality of the individual name. One's own experience depends on one's own name.''' Whereas for the some the most rational is the highest category, for Rosenzweig the most personal of all being is the highest; God is most individual. Rosenzweig^ creation-theory causes him to strictly divide his language theory. Creation recognizes God in the third person, the creator, the HE, and revelation acknowledges God the revealer, the God in the second person the I or the THOU. In the story of creation no I or Thou are mentioned. In beginning HE said and IT became. Rosenzweig relates rational thinking to creation, and emphasizes that in creation every one was created "according to their kind". He wrote68: [Adam] "becomes the first personal name among all the generic creatures, all the beings which are merely created after their kind". Adam is both a name of the kind and a proper name. It is the beginning of individuality that is central in Rosenzweig^ philosophy. The language of revelation is the language of the individual in moments of love and trust, "it is the string upon which everything human is threaded"69. Adam is created in the "image of God". He is "set apart from other creatures and, with or without personal name, endowed with what the creator denied even to the heavenly luminaries: with resemblance to God, with a personality not mediated through the generalization of category nor necessitating multiplicity... something new has dawned... The breath of life has been breathed into man, but does he really exhale it too? Does he speak? He is created mute (stumm, 67 Der Stern, II, 208; The Star, 186-87. 68 Der Stern, II, 172; The Star, 155. 69 Der Stern, II, 123; The Star, 111.</page><page sequence="20">XXIV Rivka Horwitz speechless)70. Adam, as though, internalized the divine breath but remained silent. When God approached him and asked "Where art thou?" he hid and avoided standing before God, but when God called Abraham he answered: "Here am I". Rosenzweig follows his system, because for him speaking, dialogue and revelation are one and the same. In Rosenzweig's description of Adam emphasis is laid on the difference between categories and names. Calling of animals by name was, according to Rosenzweig, a revelation. Rosenzweig, in contrast to Benjamin and Hamann, emphasizes that the name expresses a being's individuality. The height of individuality is the height of that which cannot be explained by reason the name of God. As he says, God is the most subjective and most accidental of all. He alludes to the experience of the Jewish people at Mt. Sinai, "The ground point of revelation is the midpoint and the beginning in one; it is the revelation of the divine name. The constituted community and the composed word live their lives from the revealed name of God up to the present day...For name is in truth word and fire, and not sound and echo...it is incumbent to name the name and to acknowledge: I believe it."71 This is the heart of his dialogical thinking. Because of Rosenzweig's emphasis on the irrational aspect of the name we discover a whole new range of powerful thoughts. A short historical observation In conclusion we wish to show that Hamann's view also has political effects. The tendency for particularism opposed by the rational and liberal vision of the Enlightenment, becomes meaningful a hundred years later when the Jew's hope of being accepted by the general society were shattered. General society never existed and the idea of it was no longer attractive; German Jewry was in despair; and they saw that emancipation was bankrupt. Though Rosenzweig was raised on the legacy of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution and its effects on some liberal Germans humanists and rationalists, he was aware of the weaknesses of the Enlightenment. True, the Jewish struggle for the modern world was carried out by joining the liberal parties. The Emancipation movement argued that if reason is universal, the Jews can be part of mankind and can gain human rights. This is contrary to 70 Der Stern, 172, The Star, 155. 71 Der Stern, II, 209; The Star, 188. Commentators usually think that the chapter revelation addresses Jews and Christians alike, but here revelation alludes to Mount Sinai.</page><page sequence="21">Hamann and Rosenzweig on Language — The Revival of Myth XXV Rosenzweig's line of thought, thus he joined Hamann rather than Mendelssohn, the great spokesman of natural religion. Hamann was not unfriendly to the Jews, but his opposition to the Enlightenment led him to oppose Mendelssohn and write a book against his 'Jerusalem'—'Golgotha und Scheblimini'.72 He rejected Mendelssohn's attempt to reconcile Judaism and deistic theology. He thought that the latter belittles Judaism. Hamann bases his accusations on matters he found in Jerusalem: a) The distinction between the eternal truths of natural religion that are rational, and the historical truths of religion that cannot always be valid, appears to Hamann as a distortion of Judaism, which is an historical religion, b) According to Mendelssohn the legislation of Moses involves no dogma, no truth necessary for salvation and no universal proposition. Hamann claims that this robs Judaism of deeper content and the messianic hope, c) Eternal truth is revealed to the whole mankind through nature and the thing and never through the letter; For Hamann God reveals himself both in nature and in the Bible, d) Hamann questions Mendelssohn's separation of state and religion, founded on a separation between actions and conviction, a matter that appears impossible to Hamann. When one reads Hamann's attack demanding that Judaism should be "biblich, zeitlich und sprachlich"73 one realizes that the new philosophy of Mendelssohn was in Hamann's eyes too deistic. The philosophy of the Enlightenment took from Judaism its deeper content as it wanted to overcome the limitation of particularism. On the other hand, one must also see that Jerusalem was an apologia and apologetic writings take the cue from the other, and do not reveal the whole truth; I am certain that Judaism meant for Mendelssohn much more than the way it comes out in this presentation as a natural rational religion. One can see his deeper Jewish identity in his commentary in Hebrew to the Tora that he edited and partially wrote. Hamann, however, is convinced that the yoke of the deists is an impossible burden on Judaism. One can easily deduce that Hamann believed that if the emancipated Jew follows deism or the like, his Judaism may wither, as actually happened. But the forces of history were too strong to hold this development back, and neither Mendelssohn nor the coming generations could have acted otherwise. Hamann simply rejects the presuppositions of deism and Lessing and demands a much richer outlook on man and religion. We find him close to the 72 Hamann, Golgotha und Scheblimini, 1784, Ν, III, 293-320. On his attitude to the Jews, see also Ze'ev Levi's work mentioned in Note 3. 73 Hamann Ν. Ill, 303; O'Flaherty, Hamann, p. 160-165.</page><page sequence="22">XXVI Rivka Horwitz post-emancipation view and one can find a criticism of the Enlightenment in his spirit in the writings of Rosenzweig and Gershom Scholem. First we wish to present Leo Strauss' retrospective view on the past two hundred years of Jewish history; he wrote:74 "The German-Jewish problem was never solved. It was annihilated by the annihilation of the German Jews. Prior to Hitler's rise to power most German Jews believed that their problem had been solved in principle by liberalism; German Jews were Germans of the Jewish faith. ... They assumed that the German state ... ought to be neutral to the difference between Christians and Jews or between Non-Jews and Jews. This assumption was not accepted by the strongest part of Germany. In the words of Herzl 'Who belongs and who does not belong is decided by the majority'". The despair over the lack of a solution for the problem of Jewish life in Germany is very pronounced in the writings of Gershom Scholem. He thought that the emancipation gave the Jews too little and that the German Jew lives in an illusion and fails to see that one cannot be a German and a Jew. He quotes75 the famous slogan from the battles of the Emancipation, which says "For the Jews as individual everything, for the Jews as people nothing", and comments "that is to say for the Jews as Jews — nothing". Rosenzweig similarly in his impressive article "It is Time" (written during the First World War), wrote76 "When in the first half of the last century, [the Jew was] invited to participate in the communal life of the people,... [and by a paragraph of the law], the barriers which up to that time had prevented him from sharing such a life, [were removed]. ...It was only the reactionary who thought differently... We have learned that... the best he [the Jew] can gain from that is material success; from the point of view of inner life, however, it is not only no advantage for the community, but a loss. The community must be considered a community to its own members as well as to the outside". Scholem, who was from his youth a strong believer in Zionism drew consistent conclusions from this point of view and left Germany. Rosenzweig, despite his being a sharp diagnostician of the situation, wanted to build Jewish life in Germany and ran into self-contradictions. The attitude of Rosenzweig to Mendelssohn was studied by Paul Mendes Flohr, yet he did not relate Leo Strauss, Spinoza's Critique of Religion, Preface to the English edition, New York, 1965, p. 4.

Rosenzweig, though, in an article written in 1929 to a Gedenkbuch for 200 years to Moses Mendelssohn's birth appreciates Mendelssohn yet even there criticizes Mendelssohn for his failure in leaving German Jewry defenseless and in not educating his children so that they would remain within the Jewish fold. Yet how one could overcome this problem is not clearly shown. Ten years earlier in his Kassel lectures on Nathan the Wise he criticized Mendelssohn more in the spirit of Hamann. Mendes Flohr wrote77: "He (meaning Rosenzweig) regarded both Lessing and his beloved Jewish friend as somewhat benighted in their shared assumption that the fraternity between Jew and German would be unproblematic and that good will and intellect alone were sufficient to neutralize the possible sting attendant to culture and religious differences. Their naivete, according to Rosenzweig is reflected in Nathan's plaintive protest, 'Is a Christian or a Jew sooner a Christian or a Jew than a human being?"' Rosenzweig comments that Lessing's Nathan was a disembodied Jew, 'abstracted' from the concrete reality of Judaism. "Nathan is indeed 'a naked man' hence the differences and other faith communities 'are merely a matter of dress, food and drink'"78. Rosenzweig in accepting Hamann's view rejected the "pure" men for whom the intellect is their main characteristic. Lessing's human being is bloodless, it is a sentimentality that is not Jewish. Rosenzweig wrote "Mendelssohn and Lessing are the tragedy of the Jews until this very day". Rosenzweig is ashamed that only the Jews are still interested in Nathan.79 He also criticised Mendelssohn for defining Judaism as a revealed legislation, charging that this relegated Judaism to the observance and the ceremonial and detached it from the cultural. Rosenzweig's own understanding of Judaism is close to Hamann's, putting an emphasis on revelation and interpretation and presenting Judaism as a community of believers. He sees the Jews as a community where each generation hands the Tora and its interpretation to the next generation for hundreds of years, considering always the sons as the builders. Rosenzweig complains that Mendelssohn's Jew was a divided person, as a human being he participates in the culture and as a Jew he fulfills the law. The unified person is a central demand of Rosenzweig's understanding of the human being throughout the Star of Redemption. 77 Paul Mendes-Flohr, Mendelssohn and Rosenzweig, Der Philosoph Franz Rosenzweig, Internationaler Kongress — Kassel, Miinchen, 1986, p. 215. 78 F.

In fact, Goethe characterizes the thought of Hamann as follows80: "All that a man undertakes to perform, whether by deed, by word, or otherwise, must proceed from all his powers united; everything isolated is worthless". As one can see in this instance even issues of politics, religion, as well as the understanding of man were influenced by the major focus on the importance of particularism, the concrete and the impossiblity of absolute reason which were the background of Hamann's and Rosenzweig,s Biblical faith and philosophy of language. 80 The Autobiography of Goethe, trans.
