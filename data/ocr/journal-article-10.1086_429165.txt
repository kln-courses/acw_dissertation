<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> THE CYPRIOT APHRODITE CULT: PAPHOS, RANTIDI, AND SAINT  BARNABAS* PHILIP H. YOUNG, University of Indianapolis I. Aphrodite, the Cypriot Fertility Goddess In modern tourist literature Cyprus is promoted as “the island of  love,” following a tradition of  identifying it with a goddess of  fertility and sexuality that stretches back at least to the Chalcolithic period. In Greco-Roman mythology the sea-born goddess Aphro- dite/Venus was said to have emerged from the frothy waves onto the island of  Cyprus, tra- ditionally at the impressive rock on the southern coast labeled on maps as Petra tou Romiou but called universally “The Rock of  Aphrodite.” The most famous sanctuary of the goddess, renowned throughout the ancient world, was located nearby at Paphos (later termed Palaiapaphos, the modern village of  Kouklia). Unfortunately there is limited ar- chaeological and literary evidence concerning the cult and site, but newly interpreted evi- dence presented here adds to that knowledge by identifying a related sanctuary dedicated to a consort god and the practice of  ritual processions between the two locations. Excava- tions conducted at various times at Palaiapaphos have indicated that the site of  the sanc- tuary of  Aphrodite was used for religious functions from the Chalcolithic period of  the third millennium b.c.e. through the late Roman period.1 Finds of  typically Cypriot cruci- form female figurines and one large but fragmentary “idol” indicate that it was the loca- tion of  a fertility cult from its beginnings. The goddess originally worshiped here would have been the Cypriot fertility/sexuality goddess, the Great Mother, referred to in inscrip- tions from the Late Bronze Age to the end of  the Classical period as the Wanassa (Queen or Lady).2 The Greeks identified her as Aphrodite, but two synonyms that continued in use through the Greco-Roman world were simply “Cypris” and “the Paphian.”3 The fertility aspects of  the goddess are clear not only from Greek myths about Aphro- dite’s birth from her father’s severed genitals, but also in the description of  her in many myths as having an effect on vegetation, such as in, for example, Hesiod’s reference to her * Translations of  Greek words throughout this ar- 1 Franz Georg Maier and Vassos Karageorghis, Pa- ticle are based on Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, phos: History and Archaeology (Nicosia, 1984); Maier, Henry Stuart Jones et al., A Greek-English Lexicon “The Sanctuary of  Aphrodite,” Cyprus Today, July- (New York, 1996) and William F.

The eastern influences on the originally indig- enous fertility cult probably explain the inaccurate story of  Herodotus that the sanctuary at Palaiapaphos was founded from the oldest temple of  “Heavenly Aphrodite” at Askalon in Syria.8 II. Archaeological Evidence for the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos Architectural remains at Palaiapaphos include wall fragments from the Bronze Age to Roman periods but provide little information on cultic activities because the sanctuary was severely damaged by Roman leveling operations and the subsequent medieval con- struction of  a sugar-cane processing facility on the site. Several literary references do, however, provide some information about lost physical structures at the sanctuary. Pliny, for example, noted in passing that “Paphos possesses a famous shrine of  Venus on a cer- tain court in which rain does not fall. . . .” Tacitus gave the most detailed information in a description of  a side-trip taken by the future emperor Titus to visit the sanctuary. Of  par- ticular importance is Tacitus’s description of  the peculiar object of  veneration in place of the cult statue that a Greek or Roman would have expected: While he [Titus] was in Cyprus, he was overtaken by a desire to visit and examine the temple of  Pa- phian Venus, which was famous both among natives and strangers. It may not prove a wearisome di- gression to discuss briefly the origin of  this cult, the temple ritual, and the form under which the goddess is worshipped, for she is not so represented elsewhere. [His discussion of  foundation myths is omitted.] Only a descendent of  Cinyras is now consulted as priest. Such victims are accepted as the individual vows, but male ones are preferred.

Blood may not be shed upon the altar, but offering is made only with prayers and pure fire. The altar is never wet by any rain, although it is in the open air. The representation of  the goddess is not in human form, but it is a circular mass that is broader at the base and rises like a turning-post to a small circumference at the top. The reason for this is obscure.9 Maximus of  Tyre also mentioned the odd cult image: “Aphrodite has sacred rites among the Paphians. You would not say that the statue resembles anything but a white pyramid, the substance of  which is unknown.”10 Philostratus noted that Apollonius of  Tyana “. . . sailed to Cyprus and landed at Paphos, where there is the statue of  Aphrodite. Apol- lonius marvelled at the symbolic construction of  the same, and gave the priests much in- struction with regard to the ritual of  the temple.”11 Coins of  the Roman imperial era (Augustus through Septimius Severus) support these odd descriptions of  the cult “statue” and its location by showing a cone-like object under what has been interpreted either as a tripartite structure or, more likely, a single one in front of  a hall meant to be understood as being in the background.12 In fact, a large, gray, conical stone that is probably the very object in question, despite the reference noted above to its white color, has long been known at the site and is preserved in the archaeo- logical museum there (fig. 1). Although many interpretations of  the coin representations have been attempted, for example, comparisons with three-halled structures in Asia Mi- nor, perhaps the simplest explanation is that of  a canopy covering over but not enclosing the aniconic cult object, thus explaining the historians’ otherwise enigmatic comments about it being in the open air but not getting rained upon. One is reminded of  the open-air, roofed structure that covered Praxiteles’s famous statue of  nude Aphrodite at Knidos. Commentators on the sanctuary at Palaiapaphos have concluded from the archaeological, literary, and numismatic evidence that in the historical periods the central site was laid out in the style of  a Near Eastern court sanctuary that combined a large open temenos with a smaller, covered “holy-of-holies” for the sacred stone.13 A reference to other structures at Palaiapaphos was made by Clement of  Alexandria, who quoted a statement by Ptolemaeus the son of  Agesarchus “. . . that in the temple of  Aphrodite at Paphos both Cinyrus and his descendents lie buried,” but the comment may be nothing more than an indication that there were other structures at the site as would be expected. It is likely to be a late misin- terpretation of  the nature of  these buildings, since archaeologists have found no tombs at the site.14 About the third century b.c.e., the city of  Paphos was moved some 15 km to the west, most likely to take advantage of  the better port (of  which the Roman harbor mole still exists). The sanctuary of  Aphrodite remained at the old location, now in “Palaiapaphos,” but it declined in importance as “[Nea] Paphos” became the Roman seat of  government for the whole island. Excavations have shown that the Aphrodite sanctuary was substantially damaged in the earthquake of  76–77 c.e. and that its structures were rebuilt in the late first or second century. The subsequent literary references confirm this renewal, and Pausanias, writing in the second century, referred to its wealth.15 The cult probably experienced a 9 Hist. 2.2–3. ian Temple of  Aphrodite and Its Relation to Oriental 10 8.8.

Archaeologists, however, have found that the site remained inhabited until the seventh century, and the last written reference before early modern times was in the same era. A traveler who visited [Nea] Paphos in 1736 mistook that city for the ancient cult’s location and (ironically) the ruins of  the elaborate early Christian basilicas there when he referred to “a famous, multicolored, and exquisite huge temple in honor of  the dishonorable and vile goddess Aphrodite, which is now in ruins.”16 III. Cultic Activity at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos In literary references many ancient writers took for granted, either from personal knowledge or because of  its reputation, the richness of  the sanctuary and the types of  rites that must have taken place at Palaiapaphos in honor of  Aphrodite. In the Odyssey, after being caught with Ares in flagrante delicto, Aphrodite fled “to Paphos of  Cyprus where is 16 Alexander D.

Orphanides, eds., Sources for the His- </page> <page sequence="5"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 27 her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil imper- ishable, such as is laid upon the everlasting gods.”17 In the so-called Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite Zeus inspires in the goddess lust for Anchises, Aeneas’s father, and in order to prepare for their sexual encounter . . . she went to Cyprus, to Paphos, where her precinct is and fragrant altar, and passed into her sweet- smelling temple. There she went in and put to the glittering doors, and there Graces bathed her with heavenly oil such as blooms upon the bodies of  the eternal gods—oil divinely sweet, which she had by her, filled with fragrance. And laughter-loving Aphrodite put on all her rich clothes, and when she had decked herself  with gold, she left sweet-smelling Cyprus and went in haste towards Troy. . . . 18 Ovid reflected the popularity of  the sanctuary and its atmosphere in his version of  the story of  “the Paphian hero” Pygmalian: “And now the festal day of  Venus had come, which all Cyprus thronged to celebrate; heifers with spreading horns covered with gold had fallen ’neath the death-stroke on their snowy necks, and the altars smoked with incense.”19 Cle- ment of  Alexandria, writing in the late second century c.e., expressed his Christian dis- gust with the still on-going pagan rites begun by “Kinyras, of  Cyprus, who had the audacity to transfer the lascivious orgies of  Aphrodite from night to day, in his ambition to deify a harlot of  his own country. . . .”20 He also referred obliquely to divination rites at the sanc- tuary, and the second-century writer Chariton mentioned sacrifices at the sanctuary and also divination of  the future by the priests of  Aphrodite, “who were also prophets.”21 Although couched in metaphoric language, the references allude to ritual bathing, the use of  perfumes and oils, incense burning, ritual prostitution, and divination as aspects of the cult practices at Palaiapaphos. The most notorious of  the cultic activities in honor of Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos was ritual prostitution, as evidenced primarily in late expres- sions of  Christian outrage but also implied in an early reference by Herodotus. Following a description of  a Babylonian custom whereby all women before marrying must surrender their virginity to an unknown man, the historian commented that this rite occurs near a temple of  “Mylitta (that is the Assyrian name for Aphrodite)” and added the somewhat ambiguous statement that “there is a custom like to this in some parts of  Cyprus.”22 Even if  Herodotus misunderstood the Babylonian custom, his reference to ritual prostitution in Cyprus reappears in later reports. Ennius (ca. 180 b.c.e.) and Ovid (ca. 10 c.e.) stated that Aphrodite established the art of  prostitution in Cyprus, and there is archaeological support for sacred prostitutes at some Cypriot temples.23 “Literary testimonia as well as a range of objects connected with the Cypriot goddess and her later manifestation as Aphrodite would suggest that sexuality was also a powerful characteristic of  the goddess worshipped in Cyprus.”24 It has been pointed out that for the British colonialists of  the nineteenth cen- tury the ancient references to the sexuality of  the Aphrodite cult with its exotic oriental 17 The Odyssey of Homer Done into English Prose, 21 8.2.7–9.

The Male Consort of Cypriot Aphrodite In both Greco-Roman and Near Eastern mythology the goddess of  sexuality and fertil- ity was often associated with a male consort, and on Cyprus there was sometimes a lesser sanctuary for this god nearby the more prominent one for the goddess. The marriage of Aphrodite and Hephaistos in Classical mythology may, in fact, reflect the critical impor- tance of  copper mining and smelting for Cyprus (“copper” probably being the very origin of  the island’s name). The fertility of  Aphrodite is connected with the rich production of copper, born from the land itself, while her consort/husband was connected to the smelt- ing operations performed on the ore. “The discovery [at Kition] of  two bronze statuettes, one male and the other female, standing on a base in the form of  a copper ingot, supports this hypothesis.”27 Recent excavations at ancient Idalion (modern Dhali) located at a half- way point from the mountain mines and the coastal shipping ports have discovered a “temple of  Apollo” on the lower slopes of  the eastern acropolis of  the city that was crowned by a larger “temple of  Aphrodite.”28 Interestingly, this hill is also traditionally associated with the story of  Adonis, whose name probably derives from the Semitic title “Adon” meaning “lord.”29 In Greco-Roman mythology Adonis was the son of  Kinyras, king of Cyprus, who had been seduced by his daughter Myrrha (or Smyrna). The handsome youth was taken by Aphrodite as her lover, but after he was accidentally killed by a boar, she searched for his body and found it (significantly) in a sanctuary of  Apollo in Cyprus.30 Although Zeus would not restore him completely to life, she persuaded him at least to per- mit him to accompany Persephone in her half  year on earth and half  in the underworld. As noted above, the Kinyrad clan provided the high priest at the sanctuary of  Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos through much of  antiquity, and it is worth noting that in some myths Kiny- ras is said to be favored by Apollo or even to be his son.31 Three aspects of  the myth are especially important: the subordination of  Adonis to the goddess; his clear representation of  the annual cycle of  the earth’s fertility, paralleling Aphrodite’s connections both to natural and human fertility; and his association with the name Apollo, perhaps reflected in 25 Michael Given, “Corrupting Aphrodite: Colonist “Idalion, Cyprus: Conquest and Continuity,” in Wil- Interpretations of  the Cyprian Goddess,” in Engender- liam G.

On Cyprus it seems that both the names Adonis and Apollo were used for the dying/ reviving male consort of  the fertility/sexuality goddess Aphrodite. The association of  the two Cypriot deities Wanassa/Aphrodite and Adonis/Apollo parallels the Near Eastern myths of  a female deity and semidivine lover, such as Inanna and Dumuzi, Ishtar and Tammuz, and the Egyptian Isis and Osiris. These couples represent dying and reviving elements of nature and the cycle of  seasons. From Babylonia to Rome there were festivals of  the “Adonia” celebrating the marriage of  Aphrodite and Adonis and mourning his inevitable death, and on Cyprus the center for the festival (for which it is even possible that the Hymn to Aphrodite was written) was at Palaiapaphos.33 It is likely that in the cultic rituals performed there the high priest of  the Kinyrad clan and the chief  priestess of  the sanctuary took on the roles of  Wanassa/Aphrodite and Adonis/Apollo. “We may imagine ceremo- nies of  sacred marriages in the Sanctuary at [Palaia]Paphos, so frequent in Oriental reli- gions and which by the union of  the king or priest and the goddess (represented by the queen or the high priestess), revived the forces of  nature in the cycle of  seasons.”34 V. Rantidi, the Sanctuary of Paphian Aphrodite’s Consort The possibility that Cypriot sanctuaries of  the fertility/sexuality goddess might have lo- cated near them corresponding ones for her consort raises the question of  whether the fa- mous Aphrodite complex at Palaiapaphos could also have had a related sanctuary not yet identified. It happens that on a hill called Lingrin tou Dhigeni, only 6 km from Palaiapa- phos in the area known as Randi or Rantidi Forest (now largely denuded), are the remains of  another sanctuary complex that, until recently, has been poorly documented (fig. 2).35 That it is a cultic installation is evidenced by earlier finds of  a large number of  Cypro- syllabic dedicatory inscriptions, fragments of  votive figurines and life-size terra-cotta stat- ues, and multiple building foundations. Pottery indicates that the site was in use at least from the Cypro-Archaic through late Roman periods. Of  particular significance is the fact that Rantidi enjoys a direct line of  sight to the famous Aphrodite sanctuary at Palaiapa- phos. The road between the two is not straight because it must avoid the steep descent to the river valley of  the Kha Potami by passing along the more gently sloping plateau (called Kapsalia) directly from the Rantidi sanctuary to the sea and go along the coast before rising again to Palaiapaphos, which is slightly inland. Recent preparations for a tourist hotel com- plex are today reshaping the area near the Rantidi site, but until a few years ago the sanc- tuary was located on what was only a country track. The importance of  the road, however, 32 Photios 190. scription may give it as Akra or “The Heights”: Georgia 33 Vassos Karageorghis, Cyprus from the Stone Age Bonny Bazemore, “Erotica from the Sanctuary in Ran- to the Romans (London, 1982), p. 130. tidi Forest, Cyprus,” Near Eastern Archaeology 63/2 34 Meier and Karageorghis, Paphos, p. 368.

The proximity of Rantidi to Palaiapaphos by road and by sight and the similar long periods of  occupation suggest that the two sites are related. The Rantidi sanctuary was discovered in 1909 when workmen from a nearby farm were collecting stones and noticed that some of  them had inscriptions on them. The stones came to the attention of  Max Ohnefalsch-Richter, a well-known early antiquary working in Cy- prus; he visited the site and wrote enthusiastically to German scholars about the inscrip- tions in the mysterious Cypriot syllabary and about his opinion that Rantidi was an older and more important site than Palaiapaphos itself. In the Illustrated London News he hailed the site as the “Cyprian Mount Olympus,” and he even speculated that Rantidi was the original site of  the famous Aphrodite cult that was only later transferred to its well-known location.36 A rock-cut, two-part cavity that he identified as a “holy water basin” is still vis- ible at the site (fig. 3). In 1910 the Cypriot government issued a permit to Robert Zahn, Assistant Keeper of  the Berlin Museum, to excavate at Rantidi; no final report was ever pub- lished, but a few photographs and sketches of  the site survive. His excavations revealed several long, narrow structures that he called “temples,” but all the small finds he removed 36 4 February 1911. </page> <page sequence="9"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 31 Fig. 3.—I am kneeling next to the basin cut into the bedrock in the Rantidi sanctuary, possibly used for cultic  purposes. have since disappeared. In 1955 excavators working at Palaiapaphos decided to survey the nearby Rantidi site and found 21 new inscriptions on the surface of  the recently plowed sanctuary area. In a 1980 survey of  Rantidi by the German expedition to Paphos under Franz Georg Maier, artifacts and pottery from the Chalcolithic to the Roman and medieval periods were found. A catalogue of  the almost 200 Cypro-syllabic inscriptions, which are the most remarkable finds from the site, was published in 1983 by Terence B. Mitford and Olivier Masson.37 Their epigraphical analysis indicates that the inscriptions date from the sixth century b.c.e. and that all are votive in nature (reflecting their location in a sanctuary). Most of  them were cut onto the face of  a roughly squared stone whose top was carved into a concave shape; these stones have usually been interpreted as offering bowls due to their shallowness, but other usage, such as statue bases, has not been ruled out (fig. 4). If  used for offerings, there are no traces of  incense burning; it has been suggested that libations are more likely, either wine or (paralleling the literary references to the Palaiapaphos sanc- tuary) perfumed oils.38 37 Terence B.

His fanci- ful translations included many references to Aphrodite and Apollo, but the more accurate study by Mitford and Masson showed that the inscriptions do not include either the name of  the site itself  or the deity to whom they were dedicated because virtually all are simply a proper noun in the genitive case for the purpose of  identifying to the deity the name of the person who made the offering. One stone, however, is unique in that it is a boundary stone, probably of  the sanctuary itself. The syllabic signs of  the inscription read to-te-o- to-po-*-e-o-se, which would be the equivalent of  tΩ qeΩ tΩ fo*hÅoÍ. Although the epithet is unclear, the masculine form of  the first words clearly refers to a male god. Other sup- port for identifying the deity worshiped at Rantidi as male comes from laconic references preserved in letters written to the Chief  Secretary of  the Cyprus Government after the early excavations in 1910.40 Zahn reported that “. . . we found . . . many fragments of  terracotta figures, some of  them of  double life-size which seem to point to a sanctuary of  Dionysos.” Although he did also mention “statues of  gods and goddesses,” he felt that the finds indi- cated the cult of  a male deity. Peristianis also mentioned finds that point towards a male focus: “. . . 173 fragments of  clay statures, statuettes and of  figurines representing satyrs and actors of  Dionysos, two fragments of  archaic beard of  a colossal terracotta statue, probably of  Zeus or Dionysos, as well as fragments of  various clay animals, i.e., dogs, horses, bulls, etc., and phalli. . . .” Finds of  male “snowman” and horse-rider figurines in the 1955 and recent surface surveys support the male-deity hypothesis.41 39 For the most recent work on the inscriptions, see 40 Quoted in Mitford and Masson, Syllabic Inscrip- Bazemore, “Display and Viewing,” in Smith, ed., Script tions, pp. 6–7. and Seal Uses. 41 Ibid., p. 10. </page> <page sequence="11"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 33 From 1997 to 2000 a team from the University of  Indianapolis conducted exploratory excavations at and around the hill of  the Rantidi sanctuary.42 Goals included documenting the general site, surveying the nearby antiquities on land soon to be transformed by tourist hotel installations, and, especially, rediscovering the foundations unearthed by Zahn in or- der to provide an archaeological context for the unique collection of  inscriptions. Surface surveying confirmed that the Rantidi area is rich in antiquities. Chalcolithic finds from sites around the hill of  Lingrin tou Dhigeni included an assortment of  lithics, large grind- ing stones, and distinctive pottery. The Bronze Age was not represented, but at the sanc- tuary itself  decorated pottery sherds from Cypro-Geometric through Roman date indicate a long period of  occupation. Many fragments of  ceramic figurines were found, along with pieces of  larger statuary including some that must have approached life-size. One unique figurine, in the form of  a woman with spread legs and exaggerated vulva, is surely a re- flection of  a fertility cult.43 A stone “horns of  consecration” similar to ones known at the Palaiapaphos sanctuary was recovered from a modern goatherd’s fold. A sample excava- tion on a plateau down the slope from Rantidi produced a huge, stone-lined, olive-oil pro- cessing installation of  Hellenistic date exactly like others known in the Palaiapaphos area. Two of  the several rock-cut dromos tombs at the edge of  the sanctuary site were excavated, but millennia of  looting had removed useful finds (fig. 5). Survey work demonstrated, how- ever, that the many tombs around the base of  the Lingrin tou Dhegeni hill must represent a necropolis associated with the sanctuary. The recent Rantidi expedition’s primary focus to rediscover and analyze the sanctuary structures was largely unsuccessful, but much information about the site and its vicinity was recovered. The location of  the walls found by Zahn could be roughly extrapolated from his surviving drawings, but excavation revealed that this area, although covered with surface stone fragments, has been ploughed down to bedrock with the resultant destruc- tion of  virtually all of  the walls. A few dressed stones were discovered in situ, but no plans of  the buildings could be recovered (fig. 6). Amazingly, one hitherto undiscovered votive offering table with a Cypro-syllabic inscription was recovered down the hill from the sanctuary site, but no evidence for the original locations of  these remarkable objects was found (fig. 4). A large, natural cave in the bedrock was excavated that revealed a care- fully constructed wall creating a small forecourt to control access to the mouth (fig. 7). The large number of  small, almost intact bowls in the debris excavated from this cave could indicate cultic practice. It is the expedition leader’s argument that the cave was the location of  oracular ceremonies and could be the very focus of  the male deity’s dying and reviving cult.44 Putting together finds of  terra-cotta statues of  males and phalli found at the site, the suggestive evidence of  the cavern and stone-cut basin, and the textual evidence of the fertility cult of  Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos, she concludes that “[t]he cult at Rantidi sanctuary, then, not only stood in close proximity to the temple of  the great goddess of  Paphos, but also, in its orgiastic and oracular ritual, seems to have shared important attributes of  the cult of  the goddess on the plain below.”45 It seems reasonable to conclude 42 Led by Georgia Bonny Bazemore (assisted by 43 Bazemore, “Erotica.” me), who may continue work there under other spon- 44 Idem, “Display and Viewing,” p. 184. sorship.

VI. A Newly Recognized Ancient Reference to the Paphos/Rantidi Cult The Acts of Barnabas There are very few literary references to the Palaiapaphos sanctuary, as seen above, but there is no previously recognized reference to the Rantidi sanctuary. It is possible, however, that an obscure ancient text known as the Acts of  Barnabas may, in fact, mention both sanctuaries and, thus, add important new evidence linking cultic activity at the Aphrodite sanctuary of  Palaiapaphos to the likely sanctuary of  her consort at Rantidi. On his first missionary journey (ca. a.d. 48) the apostle Paul traveled to Cyprus with his colleague Short </page> <page sequence="13"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 35 Fig. 6.—Excavation of  a rare fragment of  surviving wall within the ubiquitous loose stone scatter in the Rantidi  sanctuary. Barnabas, who was a native of  the island and who at this point in their relationship was probably playing the role of  mentor for the newly converted Paul. Barnabas’s career is in- completely preserved in the extant New Testament, largely because of  the later fame and literary loquaciousness of  Paul. The New Testament book of  Acts (13:4–13) describes the first trip of  Barnabas and Paul to Cyprus, accompanied by a person named John (presum- ably John Mark, the cousin of  Barnabas mentioned in Col. 4:10).46 They landed at Sala- mis on the east side of  the island and traveled westward from city to city following the southern coast until they reached [Nea] Paphos on the southwest corner of  the island, the Roman center of  government. At this city “they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,” who was the consultant of  the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus, and it seems that a contest between wonder-workers occurred. Bar-Jesus tried to prevent the proconsul from listening to Paul, so the apostle worked a miracle and struck Bar-Jesus blind, with the result that the proconsul was converted. Barnabas, Paul, and John Mark then set sail from [Nea] Paphos for Perge in Pamphylia (on the southwest coast of Turkey). This incident has been much commented on by students of  the Bible. It actually 46 For an overview of  the sketchy biblical references Francisco, 1996), pp. 652–53, s.v.

Apparently, sometime after their first trip together, Barnabas entreated Paul to return to Cyprus, but the two had a falling out and Paul traveled instead to Galatia (Acts 15:35–41). Barnabas, however, undertook a trip to his native Cyprus anyway and his journey, which is not reported in the New Testament, is purportedly described in the little-known Chris- tian text called the Acts of  Barnabas. The author of  this short document claims actually to be John Mark, the cousin of  Barnabas who accompanied him on both trips. In it he reports that the two travelers took ship from Laodiceia in Syria and, after weathering storms, eventually reached northern Cyprus near Cape Crommyon and went to the city of  La- pithos (fig. 8). Then, they traveled south through the mountains (the central Troodos range), passing the city of  Tamassos, and approached Palaiapaphos on the southwestern coast. The Jewish prophet Bar-Jesus (presumably no longer blind) came out from [Nea] Paphos, recognized Barnabas from his previous trip to Cyprus with Paul, and refused them entry into that city. So, leaving the Palaiapaphos area, Barnabas and John Mark headed east towards the city of  Kourion, and en route Barnabas performed a miracle after being pro- voked by a group of  pagans they encountered. When the travelers came near Kourion, they discovered that accomplices of  Bar-Jesus had stalked them, and they were prevented from entering that city as well. So, they continued their journey along the southern coast of  the island to Amathous and Kition (modern Larnaca) and took ship around the headland to reach Salamis, where a Jewish mob seized Barnabas and burned him to death. John Mark barely escaped and eventually found a ship to take him to Alexandria in Egypt. The date of  the Acts of  Barnabas is considered by all authorities to be late, perhaps fifth century c.e.,47 and its content is clearly derived from the New Testament account in Acts of  the first missionary trip of  Barnabas and Paul to Cyprus. In both cases Barnabas and John Mark are involved, the missionaries travel to [Nea] Paphos, have a conflict with Bar- Jesus, and perform a miracle against nonbelievers; thus, at first glance, it might appear that the second account is just a garbled re-presentation of  the first one. There are, how- ever, distinct differences between the two accounts: Paul is correctly absent in the Acts of Barnabas; the route followed is essentially opposite that in the New Testament; the Roman proconsul is absent from the second account; the actions of  Bar-Jesus are more dramatic; and the miracles occur in different places and are of  very different forms. It would seem more likely that the Acts of  Barnabas was written to “take up the story” alluded to in the New Testament following the rift between Paul and Barnabas when the latter returned to Cyprus on his own. It can be conceded that the incidents of  this second trip are heavily influenced by the account of  the former one, most notably the second encounter with Bar- Jesus and the second working of  a miracle, but what is important here is that the geo- graphical and cultural details of  the account in the Acts of  Barnabas are so specific and different from the story told in Acts that they demonstrate that the writer had a firsthand knowledge of  Cyprus and was, most likely, a native of  the island himself. We can hypoth- esize a Christian Cypriot with the text of  the New Testament in hand creating a new work 47 See, for example, Alban Butler, Lives of the water (New York, 1962), s.v. Barnabas.

The striking importance of  the Barnabas text is that it seems to pre- serve traditions about the Rantidi sanctuary that relate it to the famous cult of  Aphrodite at Palaiapaphos. Saint Barnabas’s “Miracle” at Rantidi It is the short passage of  the text describing events on the road from Palaiapaphos to Kourion that has critical relevance for this study (the Acts of  Barnabas, sections 18–19), and it will be useful at this point to examine the actual text.

We then met a certain Jew named Bar-Jesus who came out from [Nea] Paphos, and he recognized Barnabas as the man who had previously been with Paul. He [Bar-Jesus] did not per- mit us to come into [Nea] Paphos, so, reversing course, we went towards Kourion. (19) And we came upon a certain lewd ceremony being performed in the road near the city, and there was a crowd of naked women and men performing the ceremony; many lewd acts and idolatry [typically] occurred in that place. Turning toward it, Barnabas cursed it [the sanctuary], and the western part collapsed with the result that many people were injured, and many of  them even died, and the rest fled into the sanctuary of  Apollo, which is near the city called Holy. Then, when we went on to the vicinity of Kourion there were a great many Jews there who had been stirred up by Bar-Jesus and who stood outside the city and would not permit us to go into the city; so, we spent the evening under a tree near the city and refreshed ourselves there [my translation]. The two fundamental questions for our discussion concern where the “miracle” occurred and whether the reference describes cultic activity; we will study the passage in detail for answers. The events in question are set between the departure of  the travelers from Tamassos in central Cyprus followed by a traverse through the mountains and their arrival in the vicinity of  Kourion (fig. 10). The author specifically states that they arrived at Palaiapaphos (coming south out of  the mountains) but were prevented from going into [Nea] Paphos; the latter statement implies that the party had tried to go west from Palaiapaphos to the capital city 48 Text of  Constantin von Tischendorf  in Acta Phi- Apostolorum Apocrypha (1851; Hildesheim, 1959), lippi et Acta Thomae Accedunt Acta Barnabae in Acta pp. 292–302. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 39 Fig. 9.—Stone-paved surface of  road surviving near the Rantidi sanctuary before encountering Bar-Jesus. So, the travelers “turned back” eastward to follow the road to Kourion. It is important to remember that going east from the [Nea] Paphos/Palaia- paphos area the ancient road turned inland to avoid the rocky cliffs along the sea before eventually reapproaching the coastline just west of  Kourion. The “miracle” passage can- not refer to an Apollo sanctuary at Palaiapaphos itself  because, despite much archaeolo- gical investigation, no shrine connected with Apollo has ever been found there.49 As mentioned above, the recent archaeological survey work has confirmed that until modern times the main road from Palaiapaphos to Kourion went directly beside the Rantidi sanctuary. The ancient path of  this road is today still partly visible as sections of  cobbled paving show- ing through a gravel track and by stretches of  trimmed bedrock below the tall hill where the main Rantidi sanctuary is located (fig. 9). The course of  the road is also clearly shown on old maps, as early as the 1785 map of  Lord Kitchener and as late as the Baedeker Hand- book for Travelers of  1912. Thus, the situation of  the Rantidi sanctuary on the road from Palaiapaphos to Kourion makes it a candidate for the location of  the Barnabas “miracle” (see fig. 2). There is, however, a second candidate along this same stretch of  road, the well-known Temple of  Apollo Hylates, about 3 km west of  the city of  Kourion, if  it is to be understood that the author of  our passage means that the travelers had already completed most of  this leg of  their journey and were near Kourion when the events in question took place. In fact, at first reading, the phrase at the beginning of  the “miracle” passage, hßlqomen ejn tåÅ 49 Carl Graham Bennett, “The Cults of  the Ancient vania, 1980), p. 176. Greek Cypriotes” (Ph.D. diss., University of  Pennsyl- </page> <page sequence="18"> 40 Journal of Near Eastern Studies Fig. 10.—Southwestern coast of  Cyprus with movements of  Saint Barnabas near Rantidi in the Acts of  Barnabas KourÇå, might seem to indicate this very situation.50 But the premiere clue in the whole passage to the location of  the “sanctuary of  Apollo” where Barnabas performed his mira- cle is the phrase plhsÇon ejn t¬Å kaloumevn¬ ÔIerçÅ. It lacks an immediate noun precedent to tell us what is called “Holy,” but because it is in the feminine gender it cannot modify the immediately preceding word ¥erovn, which is neuter. Therefore ÔIerçÅ must refer back to the feminine word povliÍ at the start of  the passage, which gives the correct translation as “near the city which is called Holy,” a reference that can only refer to Palaiapaphos. The distance between Palaiapaphos and Rantidi is only 6 km, certainly a distance appropriate for the use of  the word plhsÇon, while this description would seem inappropriate for the 32 km distance from Palaiapaphos to the Temple of  Apollo Hylates at Kourion.51 The problematic word at the start of  the passage is hßlqomen, aorist of  the verb eßrcomai, which usually means “come”; it can also, however, have the second meaning of  “go” as in “go- ing to something,” which explains the confusion. The author of  the text is simply closing his story of  the missionaries’ rejection at [Nea] Paphos by saying that the travelers left and “went towards Kourion.” A second important observation indicating that the author was not referring to the Temple of  Apollo Hylates is that the installation there was dedi- cated to a woodland god concerned with trees and nature, not the sexuality and fertility of Palaiapaphos and Rantidi; as we will see below, these are the very nature of  the events Barnabas is said to have witnessed on the road. So, why does the author of  the “miracle” passage refer to a sanctuary of  “Apollo”? The answer is that, as discussed above, the names Apollo and Adonis could be used somewhat synonymously on Cyprus to identify 50 David Soren and Jamie James, Kourion: The (Acts 13: 4–12),” Tyndale Bulletin 46/2 (November Search for a Lost Roman City (New York, 1988), 1995): 221. He gives the ancient distance via the Ro- p. 162. man road from Kourion to Palaiapaphos as 22 miles 51 David W. J. Gill, “Paul’s Travels Through Cyprus (35.4 km). </page> <page sequence="19"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 41 the male consort of  Aphrodite; the late Christian writer was simply identifying Rantidi as a sanctuary of  the pagan male consort deity. Confirming the Rantidi identification is the fact that immediately following the “miracle” passage the missionaries are reported to have approached Kourion but to have found that a representative of  the Paphian prophet Bar-Jesus had preceded them and, as at [Nea] Pa- phos, they are prevented from entering this city. It would seem unlikely that the author of the Acts of  Barnabas would have envisioned a messenger overtaking the missionaries on the coast road from [Nea] Paphos to Palaiapaphos or on the road near Kourion because passing them in those areas would have risked visual detection. The topography around Rantidi, however, provides a perfect explanation for how Bar-Jesus’ messenger slipped by the Barnabas group because, as noted previously, from Palaiapaphos the road turns inland to avoid the rocky coastline and only later does it return to the coast before reaching Kou- rion. Thus, if  the missionaries were in the inland loop at Rantidi, a cross-country walker could have outflanked them by sticking to the coastline, or a boat could have been dispatched to deliver the message to allies in Kourion by sea without being seen from the inland road. The author envisions that while the missionaries were inland, Bar-Jesus’ representative went directly to Kourion and preceded them. If  the Rantidi sanctuary is understood as per- taining to the male consort (Adonis/Apollo) of  the female fertility goddess (Wanassa/ Aphrodite) worshiped at Palaiapaphos, it would be easy and appropriate for the Rantidi sanctuary to be described in reference to travelers who had left [Nea] Paphos and had re- cently passed Palaiapaphos as to; ¥ero;n touÅ ÂpovllwnoÍ to; oßn plhsÇon, “the nearby sanctuary of  Apollo.” A Survival of the Paphos/Rantidi Cult With the “miracle” passage now located at Rantidi, we can examine the nature of  the abhorrent pagan ceremonies that Saint Barnabas is said to have witnessed and that pro- voked his miracle making. The central issue of  what the naked men and women were doing involves the ambiguous word drovmoÍ, which is used twice in the passage. Previous translators have rendered it as “race,” “highway,” or “trail,” but, in fact, the basic meaning of  drovmoÍ is “course,” as in the course of  one’s life, the course of  the stars across the sky, or a race course. In both occurrences of  the word it is used with the verb ejpitelevw, leading previous translators to expand to either a “race being performed” or “having their exer- cises on this trail.” The verb ejpitelevw, however, more literally means “perform,” as in the performance of  ritual ceremonies. Thus the text’s author is likely not simply to be refer- ring to the undertaking of  a footrace or physical exercises but, although there are no known parallels for the usage, to a cultic ceremony involving the “performance” of  a “course” of events or, more likely, a topographical “course” such as a pilgrimage to a sacred place. Both the celebrants and the Barnabas party would have been traveling east from Palaiapa- phos along the inland road, which means that the travelers would have suddenly caught up with the slower moving procession already at the Rantidi sanctuary. This scenario is quite plausible due to the circuitous path of  the ancient road from the coast up into the hills at Rantidi—in fact, the road makes a looping turn right at the sanctuary, and even today when driving a Land Rover along the track, one has to be careful not to confront a farm vehicle suddenly coming from the east around the hilltop. </page> <page sequence="20"> 42 Journal of Near Eastern Studies Barnabas was revolted not only by the nudity of  the pilgrims, but also by the pagan cultic activity that commonly took place at the site (indicated by the verb in the imperfect), la- beled by the author of  the passage with the adjective mierovÍ (foul, depraved, or lewd). It happens that a passage from the geographer Strabo pertains to this discussion. In his sail- ing guide Strabo mentions several sites from east to west along the southern coast of  Cy- prus (14.6.3), but, most importantly, he comments on a cultic ritual associated with the “temple of  Aphrodite” at Palaiapaphos: eπta Trhvta kaμ Boovsoura kaμ PalaÇpafoÍ, o§son ejn devka stadÇoiÍ uÒpe;r thÅÍ qalavtthÍ ¥drumevnh, u§for- mon eßcousa, kaμ ¥ero;n a ̊rca∂on thÅÍ Pa ̃vaÍ ÂfrodÇthÍ . . . eπq∆ hJ PavfoÍ . . . dievcei de; pez¬Å stadÇouÍ eJxhvkonta thÅÍ Palaipavfou, kaμ panhgurÇzousi dia; thÅÍ oJdouÅ tauvthÍ kat∆ eßtoÍ ejpμ th;n PalaÇpafon aßndreÍ oJmouÅ gunaixμn suniovnteÍ kaμ ejk tΩn aßllwn povlewn. [Leaving Kourion, one comes] then to Treta, and to Boosura,52 and to Palaiapaphos, which is situ- ated at about ten stadia above the sea, has a mooring place, and an ancient temple of  the Paphian Aphrodite. . . . Then comes [Nea] Paphos . . . , which is by land sixty stadia from Palaiapaphos; and along this road every year men together with women, who assemble even from the other cities, hold a procession to Palaiapaphos [my translation]. Apparently, even after the establishment of  [Nea] Paphos as the Roman capital, worshipers held a procession to the ancient sanctuary at Palaiapaphos to participate in Aphrodite’s rites. A reference to the nature of  this ritual can be detected in Strabo’s special care to note that members of  both sexes participated in the event with the inference that this was un- common. The Greek word suniovnteÍ means more than just “going” on the road but has the added meaning of  “going together” on the road, and this is reinforced by the addition of ÔomouÅ, which also means “together with.” Another reflection of  cult practice may be con- tained in the reference to the “procession” itself  that is derived from the Greek panhgurÇ- zousi. The verb might be better translated as “hold a public festival” and the following words referring to the location “through [or along] the road.” Thus, a more literal transla- tion of  Strabo’s phrase would be: “and men along with women even from other cities [than Nea Paphos] go together holding a public festival along that road every year.” It cer- tainly sounds like the event described involved both sexes, and that a procession along the road to Palaiapaphos was actually part of  a ritual involving the famous sanctuary of  the fertility/sexuality goddess. With the new interpretation of  the Barnabas passage as a ritual procession between the sanctuary of  “Aphrodite” and that of  “Apollo” at Rantidi, Strabo’s report becomes of greater significance because the reports taken together raise the possibility that cultic pro- cessions in honor of  the goddess and her consort were a regular part of  her worship. It is interesting that the Barnabas passage states that the travelers came upon the celebrants ejn t¬Å oJdçÅ, literally, “in the road.” The phrase itself  could be taken to mean no more than that the missionaries were on the road to Kourion, except that it occurs directly following the word drovmoÍ, clearly indicating that the cultic activity itself  was being performed in the 52 The locations of  Treta and Boosura are unknown, (Wallace and Orphanides, p. 135); this identification although Treta can perhaps be identified with Cape would put Boosura in the vicinity of  Petra tou Romiou, Aspro, the high cliffs near modern Pissouri, due to a the “Rock of  Aphrodite.” note in the Stadiasmos stating that “it is a promontory” </page> <page sequence="21"> The Cypriot Aphrodite Cult: Paphos, Rantidi, and Saint Barnabas 43 road. This juxtaposition supports an interpretation of  the drovmoÍ as a ritual pilgrimage or procession. The author of  the text provides a short comment on the ritual, saying that it was being performed by many men and women who were naked, and he adds the words kaμ pollh; a ̊pavth kaμ plavnh ejgÇneto ejn tåÅ tovpå ejkeÇnå. A generic translation of  this phrase might be: “And there was great deception and error in that place,” but a ̊pavth can more spe- cifically be translated as “lustful pleasure” and plavnh as “idolatry.” These terms would seem to coordinate better with a cultic ritual of  the naked men and women as seen from the missionaries’ perspective. It is important to note that these words refer to the location, not the ritual being performed, a fact coordinate with our understanding of  Rantidi as a parallel site to the Palaiapaphos Aphrodite cult. The nature of  Barnabas’s miracle that resulted in deaths, woundings, and the flight of survivors into the Apollo sanctuary is difficult to clarify from the confusing text because the author is more interested in the miracle’s results than the event itself. The correct trans- lation would seem to be that “Barnabas turning, rebuked it [the place, not the ceremony]; and the western part fell. . . .” It should be noted that Barnabas does not rebuke the people because the verb’s antecedent is touvtå (“it”), which is singular and comes later than the phrase ejn tåÅ tovpå (“in that place”) to which it must refer. The concept of  Barnabas turn- ing around to rebuke the sanctuary with its pagan worshipers is at first hard to under- stand—did he go past the sanctuary before becoming aware of  its idolatry and have to turn back to rebuke it? In fact, however, the verb in question, stevfw, can also mean “turn to- ward,” and this interpretation clears up the problem by showing that Barnabas was on the road beside the sanctuary and had to turn toward it to perform his miracle. The phrase in- dicating what exactly caused the deaths and injuries is vague: kaμ eßpesen to; a ̊po; dusmΩn mevroÍ. Apparently, the author is indicating that some part of  the sanctuary, presumably a building, collapsed (the verb is pÇptw, meaning either “fall” or “collapse”), which strength- ens the miracle’s message against pagan rites. It is likely that the author imagines the sur- vivors taking cover inside one of  the surviving Rantidi sanctuary structures. Alternatively, if  the author’s sense is that it was a building in the sanctuary that was damaged, he may have envisioned that the survivors fled into the open areas of  the sanctuary to escape the danger. The geology of  the Rantidi hill area is layered limestone below a gravelly con- glomerate, which easily cracks away from the hillsides in small to large chunks, and there remain today many blocks of  stone lying about the hillsides. Perhaps the natural geology here played some role in the creation of  the Barnabas “miracle.” Another possibility is that the author of  the Acts of  Barnabas was writing at a period in which all or part of  the Rantidi sanctuary buildings were in ruins, which suggested to him the story of  some physi- cal collapse as the form of  the miracle he was devising for Barnabas to have performed. VII. Conclusion Our close reading of  the Barnabas passage indicates that a ritual procession with fertil- ity rites was conceived by the author of  the Acts of  Barnabas as being performed by naked men and women on the road from [Nea] Paphos to Kourion at a location where it passed a cultic site associated with lewdness from the Christian perspective, a location close to the well-known sanctuary at Palaiapaphos. Because the Rantidi sanctuary best fits the de- scribed topography and was likely dedicated to Apollo, the male consort of  Aphrodite, we </page> <page sequence="22"> 44 Journal of Near Eastern Studies can imagine a ceremonial procession from her sanctuary at Palaiapaphos to his at Rantidi culminating with rites involving nudity and ritual sexual activity. It is important to note that the Barnabas text distinguishes between the ceremonies seen on the road and the place along the road at which they were encountered. Thus, not only were the nude rituals abominable to him, but also the whole place round about was associated with sexual activity and pagan worship. In the author’s mind the road and the sanctuary are separate locations but intimately associated and located near one another. The Rantidi site accords well with this scenario because the ancient road approaches the sanctuary by gradually rising up through an elevated plain of  Kapsalia and skirting the bottom edge of  the hilltop of  the sanctuary proper. The newly interpreted Barnabas text with its preserved memories of  the Rantidi sanctu- ary and the understanding that it was the companion sanctuary to Palaiapaphos provides new insights into the Paphian Aphrodite cult. At the Cypriot sites of  Palaiapaphos and Rantidi there was worship of  the female and male forces of  natural fertility and sexuality as far back as the third millennium b.c.e., continuing in various forms into the late Roman era. At Palaiapaphos the cult focused on the female aspects as Aphrodite/Wanassa, while at the Rantidi sanctuary the focus was on the male aspects sometimes personified as Apollo. Cultic activities included ritual bathing and anointing with oils, the burning of  incense, oracular pronouncements, orgiastic/nude pilgrimages between the two sites, and sexual interaction of  men and women as sympathetic magic to encourage human fertility and that in nature. Architecture at both sites was Levantine in style, consisting of  a variety of  halls and buildings subordinate to the mostly outdoor, courtyard foci of  the cults. Although the main cult object at Palaiapaphos was aniconic, anthropomorphic terra-cotta statues of  all sizes filled the sanctuaries as representations either of  the deities themselves or, more likely, of  the donors. In the new reading and interpretation of  the passage in the Acts of Barnabas, we discover the only ancient literary reference to the sanctuary of  Apollo at Rantidi and one of  the few relating to the renowned Aphrodite cult of  Palaiapaphos. </page> </plain_text>
