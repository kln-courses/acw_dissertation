<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Virtue, Obligation and Politics," Revisited* RICHARD M. BANK University of Cali/brnia, Santa Barbara STEVEN R. MCCARL University of Denver Much contemporary literature in moral phi- losophy discusses how concepts condition under- standing, especially because they sensitize us to certain questions and exclude others. Stephen Salkever in this Review' applied this line of rea- soning to political philosophy and discovered two paradigms of politics: one based on the concept of virtue (ancient political philosophy), the other resting on obligation (modern political thought). The virtue paradigm understands politics as "a relationship among individual human beings in which some public value or law takes the place of private desire as the most authoritative guide to action." The political community, then, "is that structure (or pattern of relationships) which has as its aim the development of moral virtue among its citizens."2 This public good, moral virtue, which leads to happiness, is intelligible only if man can possess it. Good, in other words, is grounded in human nature; one cannot do ethics without doing moral psychology.3 Furthermore, one can- not do ethics without doing politics, because whether or not the good character potential in man is developed depends upon the kind of relation- ships men have, which is largely determined by politics. The politics of obligation, on the other hand, does not assume that virtue is intelligible, or needs to be intelligible, except insofar as a belief in the value of freedom (or community) might imply some kind of limited good or virtue. It is more accurate, however, to say that the value of freedom reflects a rejection of virtue as meaningful: since characterizing the good life is impossible, the value of the ends that individuals pursue cannot be assessed except insofar as they may frustrate the purposes of others. Therefore the ideal of politics is freedom-a situation in which as many individ- uals as possible can realize as many of their ends * The authors wish to thank Dave Bayley, Christopher Deering, Kurt Fischer, Caroline Freeman, David Pauls- meyer, Thomas Schrock, and Peter Steinberger for their critical comments on earlier versions of this article.

The uses of liberty, or the purposes for the sake of which communities may be organ- ized are of no consequence, because those uses or purposes cannot be evaluated. The only thing humans have in common is the common pursuit of individually determined goals (or communally de- termined goals): politics is only of importance as a means to liberty or community, which is estab- lished by contract.4 Thus, the only meaningful questions are "Why should I obey the state?" and "Who is to rule?," but certainly not "What is justice, or the good life?" The paradigm of obliga- tion focuses on "the reconciliation of the require- ments (needs and desires) of the individual and the requirements of society as a whole."5 The con- cern about obligation reveals the view that there cannot be a political (or any sort of public) solu- tion to the question of the best human life, and there can hardly be anything but a prudential, as opposed to a moral, obligation to the political community.6 Within the virtue paradigm Salkever dis- tinguishes three qualitatively distinct life-styles- the economic, the political, and the philosophical -which also represent three potentially dominant principles of human nature. They form a hierarchy such that the political is superior to the economic, and the philosophical is superior to the political.7 Our position is based generally on a theory of cognitive development common to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lawrence Kohlberg.8 Specif- 4 Salkever, "Virtue," p. 80. 5 Ibid., p. 79. 6 According to the obligation paradigm, the needs and desires of the individual are either not known, or not knowable, and even if to some extent they are known, they do not lead to moral virtue. Moral virtue is here under- stood as "the quality on account of whose presence we praise actions and characters as being good." Salkever, p. 85.

Salkever's Virtue Paradigm and Kohlberg's Cognitive-Moral Levels The Virtue Paradigm* Cognitive-Moral Levels** I. The Economic Level Economic man is primarily concerned with the satisfac- tion of his selfish needs and wants. There are of course the needs common to other animals (food, self-preservation, shelter, sex, etc.), together with the range of desires unique to man, e.g., the desire to acquire material wealth. Economic man's needs are practically limitless; he is Hobbes's natural man, committed to a perpetual search for security and well-being. Accordingly, he enters into relationships only if he expects to obtain something he desires. II. The Political Level or Level of Moral Virtue Political man subordinates his selfish desires to the aims of the polis or political community. The public good replaces the private as the primary guide to action. Moral virtues such as self-control, generosity, courage and justice become important inasmuch as the possession of such virtues gives one ''standing" in the community. Man enters into a political relationship because all good (moral virtue) depends on the community, and he re- ciprocates by serving and defending the community, its institutions and values. III. The Philosophical Level or Level of' Intellectual Virtue Philosophical man seeks intellectual virtue, i.e., the fullest possible extent of the human capacity for under- standing. "He has a voracious appetite for learning. His curiosity is not like that of a craftsman who learns only what is useful in the narrow sense and whose interest is limited by his craft. The philosopher learns simply because it seems good and an end in itself." He enters into a community to learn, and because moral virtue is necessary to intellectual virtue. I Preconventional Level The individual is responsive to cultural labels of good and bad, right or wrong, but he interprets these labels in terms of either the physical or hedonistic consequences of action (punishment, reward, exchange ot tifvors), or inl terms of the physical power of those who enunciate the rules and labels. Stage 1: The punishment obedience orientation. Stage 2: The instrumental relativist orientation. II. The Conventional Level Maintaining the expectations of the individual's family, group or nation is perceived as valuable in its own right, regardless of the immediate and obvious consequences. The attitude is not only one of con/brrnitV to the social order, but of loyalty to it, of actively maintaining, sup- porting, and justifying the order, and of identifying with the persons or groups in it. Stage 3: The interpersonal concordance or "good boy- nice girl" orientation. Stage 4A: The "law and order" orientation. 4B: The societal value orientation. III. The Principled, Autonomous, or Postconventional Level There is a clear effort to define moral values and princi- ples which have validity and application apart from the authority of the groups or persons holding these princi- ples, and apart from the individual's own identification with these groups. Stage 5A: The social-utility legalistic orientation. 5B: The higher law and conscience orientation. Stage 6: The universal ethical-principle orientation. * Sources: Salkever, "Virtue"; the quotation describing philosophical man is from Allan Bloom, The Republic of Plato (New York: Basic Books, 1968), p. 392. ** Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," pp. 164-165, 196-213; "Continuities in Childhood and Adult Moral Develop- ment," chapter 45 (manuscript) in Moralization, The Cognitive Developmental Approach, ed.

Kurtines and Grief argue that "the empirical utility of [Kohlberg's] model has yet to be demonstrated." While their argument deserves attention, it does not com- promise the theoretical foundations upon which this article is based.

Definition of Kohlberg's Stages* I. Preconventional Level Stage 1: The punishment and obedience orientation. The physical consequences of an action determine its goodness or badness regardless of the human meaning or values of these consequences. Avoidance of punishment and unquestion- ing deference to power are values in their own right, not in terms of respect for an underlying moral order supported by punishment and authority (the latter being Stage 4). Stage 1 thus defines the "socio-moral" order in terms of dif- ferentials of power, status, and possessions rather than in terms of equality or reciprocity. Stage 2: The instrumental relativist orientation. Right action consists of what instrumentally satisfies one's own needs and occasionally the needs of others. Human relations are viewed in terms such as those in the marketplace. Elements of fairness, reciprocity, and equal sharing are present, but they are always interpreted in a physical, pragmatic way. The Stage 2 sense of fairness as quantitative equality in exchange and distribution between individuals prescribes positively acts of reciprocity conceived as the equal exchange of favors or blows, or as acts of cooperation in terms of a goal of which each person gets an equal share; negatively, noninterference in the sphere of another is deemed right. 11. Conventional Level Stage 3: The interpersonal concordance or "good boy-nice girl" orientation. Good behavior is what pleases or helps others and is approved by them. There is much conformity to stereotypical images of what is majority or "natural" behavior. The sense of justice centers on the Golden Rule ideal of imaginative reciprocity rather than exchange. Related to this is a conception of equity. Since the Stage 3 individual can take the role of others in other than concrete terms, since he can consider what he would wivsh in the other's place, equity implies that it is fair to give more to a helpless person to make up for his helplessness. Behavior is frequentlyjudged by intention 'he means well" becomes important for the first time. The socio-moral order is conceived as primarily dyadic relations of mutual role-taking, mutual affection, gratitude, and concern for one another's approval. One earns approval by being "nice." Stage 44: The "laiw and order" orientation. The individual is oriented toward authority, fixed rules, and the'main- ing the given social order for its own sake. Justice is defined in terms of a social order of rules and roles which are shared and accepted by the entire community, and which constitute the community. In terms of role-taking, this means that each actor must orient to the other's orientation as a part of a larger shared system to which they both belong, and to which all are oriented. Justice is no longer a matter of real or ideal reciprocity or equality between individuals as dyads, but a matter of relations between each individual and the system. Questions of positive reciproc- ity are questions of the relation of individual work and merit to the rewards of the system; merit should be rewarded by the system and every individual must contribute to society. Conversely, "vengeance" is the right of society and is conceived not as vengeance but as "paying one's debt to society." The equality element ofjustice appears primarily in terms of the uniform and regular administration of the law, and as equity in an order of merit. Stage 4B. The societal value orientation. The individual is oriented to what is behind the rules of a given social order, e.g., to the purpose of the law and rules in terms of utility or the welfare of the majority of others, the wishes, agree- ment and viewpoint of the majority which lie behind the rules, and the "moral law" as the consensus of society's norms and beliefs, which may still conflict with the legal law at particular points. Still, the basic orientation is "con- ventional." While society's specific rules are interpreted in terms of their underlying shared values and purposes, they are reflected on from society's point of view. Society's point of view is still, itself, unquestioned, and is not, itself, reflected on from some "outside-of-society" perspective. 111. Principled Level Stage SA. The social-contract legalistic orientation (generally with utilitarian overtones). Right action tends to be defined in terms of general individual rights and of standards that have been critically examined and agreed upon by the whole of society. There is clear awareness of the relativism of personal values and opinions and a corresponding emphasis upon procedural rules for reaching consensus. Aside from what is constitutionally and democratically agreed upon, right action is a matter of personal values and opinions. The result is an emphasis upon the "legal point of view," but with an additional emphasis upon the possibility of changing the law in terms of rational considerations of social utility (rather than "freezing" it in terms of Stage 4). The law's function is seen as adjudicating between the rights and interests of one group of individuals as opposed to another, rather than as protecting the rights of all "decent" citizens. Outside the legal realm, free agreement and contract is the binding element of obligation. The social contract, which is the basis of the socio-moral order, is a justice conception which presupposes reciprocity of the partners to the agreement and equality between them prior to the agreement, and the form of this agreement takes priority over substantive justice, once agreement has been reached. Stage SB. Higher lawl and conscience orientation. The individual identifies morality with a conception of natural rights, i.e., rights which are naturally or intrinsically defined, such as rights of life and freedom. Society's demands * Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," pp. 164-165, 196-213; "Continuities," pp. 20-41.</page><page sequence="4">1976 Virtue, Obligation and Politics 889 Table 2. Continued upon the individual are valid only to the extent that they are based on a recognition of these rights which, in effect, provide the criteria for a blueprint of society, criteria by which one law or society may be said to be better than an- other. Accordingly, the individual defines the socio-moral order in terms of justification. With respect to limitations of freedom, for instance, reasons must be given for constraining people in the pursuit of what they take as good. Stage 6: The universal ethical-principle orientation. Right is defined by the decision of conscience in accord with self- chosen ethical principles that appeal to logical comprehensiveness, universality, and consistency. These principles are abstract and ethical (the Golden Rule, the categorical imperative); they are not concrete moral rules like the Ten Commandments. At heart these are universal principles of justice, of the reciprocity and equality of human rights, and of respect for the dignity of human beings as individual persons. Obligation is defined in terms of "a rational being acting as a moral agent," deciding from "a disinterested point of view that allows one to make decisions consistent with the decisions of any rational agent in a similar situation." The considerations determining one's choice are those which "any rational agent" in a similar situation should consider. development follows a cognitive-developmental sequence, making Salkever's three life-styles not only hierarchical, but empirically sequential (in time). Secondly, Salkever juxtaposes the two paradigms, claiming that they are not mutually exclusive, they are just different perspectives from within either of which the distinctions of the other are insignificant. Our analysis of the obligation paradigm leads us to conclude that it is compara- ble to Salkever's political man and to Kohlberg's conventional level. Thus the obligation paradigm is better understood as a stage in a developmental theory, rather than as juxtaposed to the virtue paradigm. (Similarly, the highest activity within the virtue paradigm-philosophic man-is better understood as a higher and later stage than obliga- tion.) As a result of employing a cognitive-develop- mental framework we are able to (1) clarify the relationship between intellectual virtue (philo- sophic man) and moral virtue (political man)-a relationship that is obscured by Salkever's ap- proach; (2) add a provocative dimension to the literature of political theory by considering the theories of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Locke to be expressions of the conventional level of cognitive- moral development, and by briefly considering the theories of Rawls and Rousseau as expressions of the principled level of cognitive-moral develop- ment; (3) support Salkever's case for the virtue paradigm by relating the findings of contemporary moral psychologists to the history of political thought; (4) contribute to the theoretical and empirical understanding of the nature of morals; and (5) provide theoretically promising possibil- ities for empirical research in the field of political philosophy. The Developmental Approach The label "cognitive-developmental" can be ap- plied to a variety of specific theories of social and cognitive development, but we are most concerned with Kohlberg's theory of moral development and those theories upon which his work is largely based, viz., the theories of Dewey and Piaget. At the very least these theories share three basic assumptions: (1) development involves qualita- tive changes in cognitive structures, i.e., changes in the organization or pattern of thought; (2) cognitive structures result from the active interac- tion of the organism and the environment rather than representing different levels of maturation or learning (in the sense of a direct shaping of the organism's responses to accord with environ- mental structures); and (3) the direction of devel- opment of cognitive structures is toward greater equilibrium or balance between the action of the organism upon the environment and of the en- vironment upon the organism." The notion of qualitative change presupposes a distinction between mental structure and learning in general. Structure refers to the organization, mode, or pattern of response and not to specific responses determined by familiarity.12 Suppose, for example, two children are confronted with the task of arranging a number of sticks by length. 13 If both children organize the problem in the same manner, e.g., by systematically comparing one I I Kohlberg, "Stage and Sequence," p. 348. 12 Dewey refers to such structures as habits: "The essence of habit is an acquired predisposition to ways or modes of response . .. rather than bare recurrence of specific acts." Human Nature, pp. 40-41. Piaget and Kohl- berg categorize such structures in terms of cognitive stages which form an invariant and hierarchical sequence. These stages form an order of increasingly differentiated and integrated structures to solve the same problems at differ- ent levels of complexity and abstraction. Higher stages displace (or rather reintegrate) the structures found at lower stages, and the structures of lower stages are there- fore both necessary for and available at higher stages. Analogously, calculus is built upon the arithmetic skills of addition and multiplication and cannot precede them; still, the mathematician who uses calculus can also add and multiply. See Kohlberg, "Stage and Sequence," p. 351. 13 Seriation of sticks is a standard Piagetian test. It is not an easy perceptual task as the sticks are generally be- tween i and i inch different in length. A discussion of procedure and the interpretation of various responses can be found in Piaget, Genetic Epistemology (New York: Norton, 1971), pp. 28-29.</page><page sequence="5">890 The American Political Science Review Vol. 70 stick to the next, there is no difference in their structural competence. If one child arranges the sticks faster than the other (but using the same procedure), we could speak of a quantitative (as opposed to qualitative) difference in their be- havior, i.e., a difference in performance. 14 On the other hand, if one constructs his series by sys- tematically comparing one stick to the next while the other randomly arranges the sticks and seriates them only after a number of attempts us- ing trial and error, we could speak of a qualitative difference in mental structure. With respect to moral judgments, qualitative novelty involves the distinction between form and content.'-5 Consider the following moral dilemma: In Europe, a woman was near death from a very bad disease, a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium for which a druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying, and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said, "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. 6 If, for example, two persons answer affirmatively to the question "Should Heinz have stolen the drug?," the content of their responses would be the same. But the underlying thought organiza- tion, the form, the reasons behind their respective responses may be quite different: e.g., one might respond that Heinz should steal the drug because if his wife died, he would have no one to cook and clean for him (Stage 2), while in contrast, the other might argue that a person's right to live takes precedence over the right to make a profit (Stage 5). In short, the same affirmative response 14 Most social learning theories do not make distinc- tions between quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior because both specific acts and general cognitive categories (space, time, causality, etc.) are considered to be reflections of structures that exist outside the individual. Kohlberg writes: " [Stimulus-response theory] explains the learning of logical operations or 'truths' in terms of the same processes as those involved in learning a social dance step (which is cognitively neutral), or those involved in 'learning' a psychosis or a pattern of maze errors (which are cognitively erroneous)." "From Is to Ought," p. 152. 15 Ibid., p. 230. 16 This story is based on one of the nine dilemmas which make up the Kohlberg questionnaire most often used to assess levels of moral reasoning. Each story con- fronts the subject with a moral dilemma, and following each story, an interviewer asks a series of questions de- signed to bring out the reasoning a person uses in dealing with the dilemma. A brief account of how to use and score the Kohlberg questionnaire can be found in N. Porter and N. Taylor, "A Handbook for Assessing Moral Rea- soning" (mimeograph, available from the Moral Educa- tion and Research Foundation, Harvard University). may nevertheless reflect qualitative differences in moral reasoning. On- the other hand, qualitatively similar reason- ing can be used to justify both stealing and not stealing the drug. An individual at Stage 4, for ex- ample, could argue that Heinz, as a husband, has a duty to steal the drug, while Heinz, as a citizen, has a duty to obey and respect the law. The form or structure of reasoning is the same in this in- stance while the content is different. The development of moral reasoning, then, re- fers not to an increased internalization of cultural rules any more than the development of logic is an internalization of the linguistic forms of the culture.'7 Stages of moral and logical reasoning do not refer to cultural contents but rather to organizational structures which emerge from an interaction between an individual and his en- vironment.18 According to Piaget, in every rela- tion between a living being and its environment, the former modifies the latter by imposing its own structure. In this way, physiologically, the organism absorbs substances and changes them into something compatible with its own substance (assimilation). An act of assimilation, however, requires that the organism adapt the structure it imposes to the substance to be absorbed and modi- fied (accommodation). Psychologically the process is the same except the interaction is entirely func- tional: assimilation no longer alters assimilated objects in a physicochemical manner, but simply incorporates them into its own form of activity, and accommodation only modifies this activity.'9 In short, assimilation refers to an organism's ac- tive attempts to apply schemes to objects and 17 Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 194. 18 These structures are the most basic modes of connect- ing experienced events-e.g., the relations of causality, substantiality, space, time, quantity, logic (referring to relations of inclusion or implication between classes or propositions), and justice (the mode of organizing role- taking experiences). See Kohlberg, "Stage and Sequence," p. 350; see also Isaiah Berlin's rich essay, "Does Political Theory Still Exist," reprinted in Contemporary Political Thought: Issues in Scope, Value, and Direction, ed. J. A. Gould and V. V. Thursby (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1969), pp. 328-357, especially pp. 350-351. If stages depended upon acquired associations, reasoning would vary by culture since different cultures teach differ- ent associations. While cultural factors cannot alter the form or sequence of development, they may speed up, slow down, or stop development, depending on the variety of experiences they generate. We discuss the types of experiences conducive to development below. 19 Piaget, Psychology of Intelligence, pp. 7-8. Dewey draws the same parallel: " [H ]abits are like [physiological I functions in many respects, and especially in requiring the cooperation of organism and environment.... [N ]atural operations like breathing and digesting, acquired ones like speech and honesty, are functions of the surroundings as truly as of a person. They are things done by the environ- ment by means of organic structures or acquired disposi- tions." Human Nature, p. 17.</page><page sequence="6">1976 Virtue, Obligation and Politics 891 events in the world, and accommodation refers to the adjustment of those schemes to the char- acteristics of the things to be known.20 For example. when an infant tries to pick up his rattle, he attempts to apply a particular scheme for grasping the rattle, choosing the scheme and ad- justing it accordingly to the shape of the rattle. A "scheme" in this sense is an organized action or form of activity applied by an organism to its environment." For Piaget, knowledge of objects and events in the world results from the equilibra- tion of assimilation and accommodation precipi- tated by the organism's attempts to apply its schemes. Fischer describes this process: An infant comes to know objects by grasping them in his hand, and must otten change the way he is holding his hand in order to grasp an unfamiliar object. He finds that different objects must be grasped in different ways, and that some (such as walls) cannot be grasped at all. In the same way that the child adjusts his hand to fit different objects, he adjusts his schemes to fit different objects and events. This modification of schemes is what produces intellectual growth . In this manner the very young infant di/jer- entiates his grasping scheme with respect to a variety of objects. At the same time he is differ- entiating a number of other schemes including his looking, hearing, and sucking schemes. Such schemes, built upon the reflexes of the newborn infant, are called primary schemes since the in- fant cannot yet intercoordinate or integrate these schemes with each other.23 The infant at the level of primary schemes, for instance, can only grasp objects which his hand encounters, independent of what he sees. But as his grasping and look- ing schemes become more and more differ- entiated (as he gets better at looking and grasp- ing), the infant begins to explore the connections between these schemes. The child may grasp his rattle out of his field of vision and, by accident at first, bring the rattle into view and look at it, or his hand may at random bump into an object at which he is already looking. In short, the environ- ment presents the chance juxtaposition of schemes which the child then explores. Such behavior char- acterizes the beginning of the intercoordination of primary schemes. When the infant completes this 2' Fischer, Piaget, chapter 2, p. 15 (manuscript). 21 Ibid., . 1 2 22 Ibid., pp. 12-13. For a more general account of the process of equilibration, see Dewey, Human Nature, pp. 81, 169-170. 23 Piaget, Th Origins of Intelligence in Children (New York: Norton, 1963). This means that an infant at the level of primar\ schemes does not associate his various sensory-motor understandings of objects and events. For example, his rattle is not a "rattle" as we understand it, but a series of unrelated tableaux: a sound tableau, a visual tableau, a tactile tableau, etc. intercoordination, we can speak of the secondary schemes grasping-in-order-to-look and looking- in-order-to-grasp. Piaget describes this process of intercoordina- tion or integration of schemes as reciprocal or mutual assimilation. In other words, component schemes incorporate (assimilate) and modify (accommodate) each other in order to form a higher-order consolidated scheme. The integrated or consolidated scheme represents a qualitative advance over its component schemes (secondary schemes are qualitatively different from and func- tionally superior to primary schemes). A con- solidated scheme in turn is differentiated and be- comes a component for higher-order integrations (secondary schemes are components of tertiary schemes, and so on). In this manner, differentia- tion and integration of cognitive structures im- ply an invariant and hierarchical sequence of cog- nitive stages. The process is much the same with respect to the development of moral judgment, but the en- vironment, instead of presenting the chance juxtaposition of grasping and looking schemes, etc., presents the juxtaposition of conflicting points of view or role expectations. For instance. in the story of the dying woman and the druggist, suppose Heinz has a Stage 4 orientation. Since his moral reasoning is conventional, he is primarily concerned with maintaining the social order and its institutions. If he takes the role of a husband, which implies the duty to "honor, cherish, and protect," he must steal the drug. On the other hand, if he takes the role of a citizen, he must con- sider the implications of stealing the drug as a generalized member of society: "If one person breaks the law for a good reason, then everyone will find good reasons, and everyone will break the law."24 If he recognizes the juxtaposition of these role claims as a situation of competing institu- tional claims-to maintain the institution of marriage, he must steal the drug; to maintain so- ciety and its laws in general, he must not steal the drug he will be unable to resolve such a con- flict with Stage 4 reasoning. In other words, if he differentiates the claims of marriage as a social institution from the claims of society in more gen- eral terms, he must reintegrate or reconcile the competing claims from a broader, more universal perspective, viz., a perspective outside that of any constituted society.25 24 Heinz could also take the role of his wife or the role of the druggist, but to do so at the conventional level would only define his duties as a husband and as a generalized member of society respectively. 25 The process of reconciling competing claims, or the process of equilibration generally, can be characterized as a process of controlling anxiety at successive levels of abstraction. For a statement of this view in a number of related contexts, see Abraham H. Maslow, Motitation</page><page sequence="7">892 The American Political Science Review Vol. 70 The recognition of moral conflicts in terms of irreconcilable institutional claims characterizes the beginning of a movement from Stage 4 to Stage 5 or, more generally, a movement from con- ventional to principled reasoning. As this move- ment continues, the differentiation of distinct and contradictory institutional claims from the claims of society in general often generalizes so that com- peting claims between classes, sexes, generations, nations, etc., become relative to one's point of view. For instance, "from the Nazi point of view, it was justifiable to kill six million Jews." Since values become relative to one's perspective, the values of one society are considered just as arbi- trary as the values of another. This relativistic tendency can become so generalized that morality becomes a question of personal preference-"it's moral for me." An individual in transition from the conven- tional to the principled level, therefore, often ap- pears to be at Stage 2, the stage of instrumental relativism. But there is a fundamental difference between Stage 2 and Stage "4k" relativists. An individual at Stage 2 makes judgments on the basis of selfish needs and wants, i.e., judgments instrumental to his wish. He is not aware of any other point of view and does not, therefore, ques- tion the validity of moral terms: good is what's good for him. On the other hand, a Stage 42 relativist is aware of the social point of view (Stage 4) but denies its final validity in defining what the individual should do. There is an equally valid individual point of view with equally valid definitions of "good" and "right," this viewpoint not being necessarily selfish, but self-realizing, one of ethical egoism.26 A position of ethical egoism provides the foundation for the differentiation of individuals as human beings from their socially prescribed roles as spouses, citizens, etc. In other words, each in- dividual comes to represent a source of equally valid definitions of what is good and right. The in- dividual's self-centered view is thus generalized and integrated into a conception of individual rights: an individual can pursue what he believes to be good only to the extent that others respect his right to do so; he must therefore reciprocally respect the right of others to do the same. As we might suspect, Stage 5 retains a clear awareness of the relativism of personal values and opinions, but right action tends to be defined in terms of gen- eral individual rights, and society's demands are recognized as legitimate to the extent that they and Personality (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1954), Ernest Becker, The Birth and Death of Meaning, 2nd ed.

Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (New York: Norton, 1968), pp. 15-44, 91-141. 26 Kohlberg, "Continuities," p. 25. are based on a recognition of these rights. This recognition is ideally embodied in a social con- tract which presupposes reciprocity of the partners to the agreement and equality between them prior to the agreement.27 The movement from stage to stage is best char- acterized as a process of differentiation and inte- gration. In parallel fashion it is a movement to- ward increased prescriptivity and universality.28 A prescriptive moral structure is, at bottom, a principle, the validity of which does not depend on external events or conditions.29 A universal moral structure is one which can be applied with consis- tency to any person, independent of his status. With respect to the moral value of human life, for example, the sequence of stages herein discussed represents a sequence of increasing prescriptivity inasmuch as the moral imperative to value life becomes increasingly independent of the factual properties of the life in question,30 and it also defines a sequence of increasing universality inas- much as successive stages define a wider circle of others subject to moral consideration and respect, from persons with physical and social status at Stage 1 to all of mankind at Stage 6. Because con- ventional morality is not fully prescriptive, it leads to internal contradictions manifest in conflicting and apparently irreconcilable institutional claims, and because it is not fully universal, it defines rights which are different for different social units: classes, races, generations, nations, etc. In con- trast, principled morality resolves such conflicts in a stable, self-consistent manner.31 According to Kohlberg, the general rule at the principled level is that, in situations of conflicting claims, the only valid claims are those consistent with the recognition of the related claims of others, and a claim is only final if one would uphold it as final no matter which role in the situation he were to play. This formula is a statement of reversible or equilibrated role-taking,32 i.e., it provides a 27 Ibid. 28 Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 185. 2Q For Kohlberg, "the increasingly prescriptive nature of more mature moral judgments is reflected in the series of differentiations . . . of 'is' and 'ought' (or of morality as internal principles from external events and expectations)." Ibid., p. 184. 30 The value of a person's life is successively differenti- ated from the value of his property possessions, his "use- fulness," his family, his nation, and his individual rights, so that at Stage 6 his life is valued in-and-of-itself, inde- pendent of any other considerations.

With respect to the "Heinz ex- ample," the druggist's claim to withhold property at the expense of a life is not reversible, i.e., he could not have recognized this claim as valid in the wife's role; on the other hand, the wife's claim to life at the expense of property rights is a valid claim which she could recognize if she were to switch roles with the druggist.

The structure of this mechanism is the structure of the principle of justice as fai ness, elaborated by John Rawls among others. 3 Of course, Salkever includes Rawls among the modern political theorists in the obligation para- digm.34 He questions the applicability of Rawls's theory of justice to the virtue paradigm primarily because of Rawls's claim that the question of the best life for man cannot be rationally or objec- tively answered.35 Rawls's position with respect to the best lite for man, however, presents no problems from our developmental perspective. In the first place, we use Rawls's statement of justice as fairness to define the structure, not the specific content, of principled thought (our term) or in- tellectual virtue (Salkever's term). The essential function of structure is organizational.

We understand both Rawls and Rousseau in terms of the virtue paradigm. Rousseau's theory of the general will is in fact fundamen- tallv equivalent to Rawls's theory of justice as fairness. Rousseau writes: 'The undertakings which bind us to the social body are obligatory only because they are mutual; and their nature is such that in fulfilling them we cannot work for others without working for ourselves. Why is it that the general will is always in the right, and that all con- tinually will the happiness of each one, unless it is because there is not a main who does not think of 'each' as meaning him, and considers himself in voting for all?"

Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey (Chicago. Rand McNally, 1963), p. 524. Salk- ever's paradigmatical scheme cannot account for Rous- seau's use of the language of legitmacy and his ambiguity about the best life for man without placing him in the obligation paradigm. We understand Rousseau's concepts of legitimacy and the good life in connection with the general will, and thus within the virtue paradigm. Au- thority is legitimate for Rousseau only to the extent that it expresses the general will, and the life of virtue must cer- tainly include as a minimum obedience to the general will (or legitimate authority). 3 See Salke\er, "Virtue," pp. 78 (footnote 4), 80 (foot- note 13), 82 (footnote 20). 3" Richard S. Peters, "Concrete Principles and the Justice as fairness, or structure or reason (ra- tionality) in general, then, while not sufficient to answer the question of the best life for man, is clearly necessary. Second, the principle of justice as fairness is not a simple extension of economic or rational choice and thus irrelevant to questions of good or vir- tue as Salkever suggests.37 The principle of jus- tice as fairness in fact presupposes the virtue para- digm to the extent that it depends on at least a minimal definition of good, a point of which Rawls himself is quite aware.38 While justice cannot pre- scribe precisely what we ought to do, still it rules out certain courses of action and sensitizes us to the features of a situation which are morally rel- evant.39 In this regard Dorothy Emmet argues against the claim advanced by Professor Hare and others that "universalizability," the rule "treat relevantly like cases alike and relevantly different cases differently"-as a strictly formal criterion, is constitutive of moral judgment. She maintains that an appeal to relevance amounts to adopting the substantive notion of fairness. Moreover, understood as impartiality in applying moral principles, universalizability takes on the substantive moral character of fairness. In other words, there is no reason to treat relevantly like cases alike, other than consistency, which is no reason at all, unless we first postulate fairness as good or right in-and-of-itself.40 Finally, Salkever's claim that Rawls's theory of justice cannot objectively answer the question of the best life for man is at best irrelevant to his claim that justice as fairness is inapplicable to the virtue paradigm, for the question of the best life cannot, even from within the virtue paradigm, be answered objectively. Indeed, the Greek notion of a life of intellectual virtue depends on the subjective ex- perience of good for its content. Such experience, however, presupposes the structure of principled thought, so that from the Greek view, to achieve intellectual virtue is at least to achieve Stage 6 autonomy.4' Rational Passions," in Moral Education, ed.

We claim only that the Greek concept of intellectual virtue, Kohl-</page><page sequence="9">894 The American Political Science Review Vol. 70 The fact that justice as fairness emerges as the most basic principle of organizing role-taking ex- periences at Stage 6 provides concrete meaning to the developmental assumption that the principles of moral reasoning emerge from an interaction between the self and the social environment. It is clear that a sense of justice would not develop without the experience of social interaction, i.e., without opportunities to take the role of others. Justice, then, does not reflect the preprogrammed tendencies of a biological organism. But neither is it a direct expression of the structure of the environ- ment, a rule imposed from the outside. It is rather the expression of an ideal equilibrium between the actions of the self toward others and the actions of others toward the self. According to Piaget, "the rule of justice is a sort of imminent condition of social relationships or a law governing their equi- librium."42 If we then accept the developmental assumption that moral principles emerge from an interaction between the self and the social en- vironment, it follows that there should be elements of justice present from the beginnings of moral behavior, and this is in fact the case. The concept of justice at the preconventional level is a functional extension of the private aims of economic man. Since his is primarily a selfish motivation, economic man enters into social rela- tionships only if such relationships promote the satisfaction of his personal needs and wants.43 He makes a charitable contribution, for example, not for the benefit of the underprivileged, but as a tax write-off, and he attributes such motivation to others as well. Accordingly, justice at this level operates in a concrete fashion, as the quantitative equality of exchange, and as reciprocal relation- ships implied by the expression "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."44 While reciprocal rela- tionships continue only so long as they remain useful, within such relationships there is a sense of obligation to fulfill one's end of the bargain, a duty which defines the corresponding right of "eye-for-an-eye" retribution. Justice at this level is the justice of the marketplace and the justice of thieves.4' Eventually economic man comes at least to the practical recognition that society and its institu- tions, formal and informal, are instrumental to the satisfaction of his private needs and wants. So, without forming any critical theory of institutions, berg's Stage 6, Rawls's justice as fairness, and Rousseau's general will are structurally compatible. despite any differ- ences in content. See footnote 62, below. 42 Piaget, Moral Judgment, p. 196, Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 194. 4 See Salkever's account of economic man, "Virtue," pp. 80-8 1. 4 Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 164. 4 The expressions "let the buyer beware" and "honor among thieves" might be said to be statements of precon- without considering whether they are what they should be, he identifies himself, his own life, with the social forms and ideals in which he lives, and repels any attack upon them as he would an at- tack upon himself.46 "The demands which the existing institutions make upon him," writes Dewey, "are not felt as the coercions of a despot, but as expressions of his own will, and requiring loyalty as such."47 Economic man thus becomes political man and, accordingly, justice no longer operates as a matter of concrete reciprocity or equality between individuals, but in terms of the relations between each individual and the sys- tem.48 Kohlberg provides the following descrip- tion of the Stage 4 concepts of justice: Questions of positive reciprocity are questions of the relations of individual work and merit to rewards of the system, "a good day's work for a good day's pay", merit should be rewarded by the system and every individual must contribute to society. Accordingly Stage 4 positive reciprocity is exchange of reward for effort or merit, not interpersonal exchange of goods or services. Negative reciprocity is even more clearly centered on the social system: vengeance is the right of society and is con- ceived not as vengeance but as "paying your debt to society." The equality element of justice appears pri- marily in terms of the uniform and regular administra- tion of the law, and as equity in an order of merit. Social inequality is allowed where it is reciprocal to effort, moral conformity, and talent, but unequal favoring of the "idle" and "immoral," poor, students, etc., is strongly rejected.49 The most basic principle of justice at the prin- cipled level is equality or distributive justice, the principle that "none should be held to have a claim to better treatment than another, in advance of good grounds being produced."50 Questions of reciprocity at this level are nothing more than questions of mutual respect. Equality and reci- procity at this level are the substantive essence of justice as fairness and, taken together, imply the imperative to treat each individual as an end in himself.51 ventional justice since they imply reciprocal relationships governed by preconventional concepts of obligation and retribution.

Role-taking most generally refers to two interrelated processes: the reaction to others as like the self, and the reac- tion to the self's behavior from the others' point of view.52 An individual in short must be able to think of himself in the shoes of another. Now it is very difficult for a master to think of himself in the role of his slave, less difficult for an officer to imagine himself as a private, and still less difficult for two players on opposing baseball teams to re- verse their roles. This might suggest that baseball players can imaginatively switch roles only be- cause they themselves are familiar with the role of the other. But more basically it suggests that role- taking depends on the shareability of roles. The master will never be the slave, nor will the slave be the master. Accordingly, master-slave relation' ships offer few opportunities for role-taking since neither party can easily imagine himself in the role of the other. More generally, "the shareability of rules and role expectations in an institution or social unit," writes Kohlberg, "rests centrally upon a justice structure underlying specific rule and role definitions."53 In a negative sense, rules "presupposes metaphysically: 1) that each man is an inde- pendent, continuant, individual entity or substance, and 2) that each man partakes of the same essential humanity with other men." Reck, "Metaphysics of Equality," in The Concept of Equality, ed. Blackstone, p. 139. If we consider these propositions as worthy of respect, thus com- bining the principle of equality and reciprocity as mutual respect, it follows that we ought to treat individuals as ends. Along these same lines, Paul Tillich writes: "The relation of equality and justice depends on the power of being in a man and his corresponding claim for justice.... What is decisive is only that man is considered as a de- liberating, deciding, responsible person. Therefore one had better speak of the principle of personality as a principle of justice. The content of this principle is the demand to treat every person as a person."

Mead, Mind, Self, and Society (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934) and James Mark Baldwin, Thoughts and Things (New York: MacMillan, 1906), 3 vols. Corresponding to the two processes of role- taking are the notions that moral judgments are based on sympathy for others and that the moral judge must adopt the perspective of an "impartial spectator" or a "general- ized other." Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 190. It is an easy step from here to the claim that justice represents an ideal equilibrium of social interaction if one avoids the pitfalls of the utilitarian maximization principle. Accord- ing to Rawls, decisions by the "impartial spectator" for utilitarians in general are those which maximize the total sum of happiness. Such decisions almost by definition "short-change" some individuals and are not, therefore, consistent with the process of reacting to others like the self. Rawls, Justice, sec. 5. 5 "From Is to Ought," p. 193. This idea is also central to Hart's justification of the equality principle. Hart argues that any system of morality which incorporates a notion of "rights" presupposes the equality principle. H. L. A. Hart, "Are There Any Natural Rights?" in and roles which are not grounded in justice do not have the quality of shareability since their very nature is arbitrary: they do not exist apart from those who enunciate the rules and fill the roles. It follows that institutions better organized in terms of justice provide greater opportunities for role-taking and, consequently, for development as well.54 From a developmental point of view, then, the political problem is one of providing just institutions, a view shared by the ancient Greeks. 55 In fact, the Greeks may have been the first cogni- tive-developmental psychologists. At any rate it is clear that the notion of develop- ment had a pervasive influence on the whole of Greek philosophy and psychology. Indeed, Robert Nisbet argues that the metaphor of growth became the basis of the entire Greek world view. In this regard he quotes Professor Sambursky: The Greek remained closely attached to the cosmos as the result of his viewing the cosmos as a living organism, a body that can be understood and comprehended in its entirety. The Greek had a profound awareness which was characterized by his biological approach to the world of matter. The teleological principle is essentially biologi- cal and anthropomorphic, so that the first basis for the conception of order in the universe was found in the system of the world of living things.56 For Nisbet, the concept of physis best summarizes the Greek preoccupation with growth and develop- ment. He writes: "If the nature of a thing is how it Society, Law, and Morality, ed. Frederick A. Olafson (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1961). For a discussion of Hart's argument, see William T. Black- stone, "On the Meaning and Justification of the Equality Principle" in The Concept of Equality, p. 129. In this same regard, Rawls writes: "The primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society, or more exactly, the way in which social institutions distribute fundamental rights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation." Justice, p. 7. 5 Just institutions per se may not be enough to generate the opportunities for role-taking necessary for develop- ment to the principled or even conventional levels. The institutions of a given social environment must be varied so as to provide, not just opportunities for interpersonal relationships, but a matrix of complex interactions. The fact that the populations of many "traditional" societies remain for the most part at the preconventional level can thus in part be explained. Kohlberg's own research in two isolated villages supports this view. Kohlberg, "From Is to Ought," p. 173. Other examples can be found in Duvignaud, Change at Shebika, Geertz, Peddlers and Princes, and Banfield, Moral Basis of a Backward Society. In one setting-Shebika-the case can be made that the role-taking opportunities generated by the presence of Duvignaud's research team precipitated a general move- ment from preconventional to conventional thought.

It is to find out what the physis is of each thing: to learn its original condition, its successive stages of development, the external factors such as water, light, and heat, that affect it, and, finally, what its 'end' is; that is, its final form, the form which may be said to be the ultimate 'cause' of it all."57 The cognitive- developmental account of moral development, we might suggest, presupposes the notion of physis: given the biological organism we call homo sapiens, the development of intelligence in general and moral reasoning in particular follows a formal pattern of differentiation and integration, defining successive and qualitatively distinct stages of de- velopment; it depends on opportunities for role- taking afforded by the external environment; and it tends toward an ideal equilibrium or final form of justice.58 But not only is developmental theory compatible with the concept of physis or an ex- pression of it, a cognitive-developmental ap- proach is at least useful if not necessary to an ex- plication of the Greek notion of social reform. Any psychological theory of development must account for the roles of both the organism and the environment. There are essentially three possi- bilities: either development proceeds primarily from the organism (nativistic, innate, matura- tional theories), from the environment (stimulus- response, social learning, associationistic theories), or from an interaction of the two (cognitive-devel- opmental theories).59 The theoretical differences between these three broad streams of thought are often subtle, matters of emphasis and interpreta- tion. But a practical analysis of each approach, a study of their social and political implications, reveals that the differences are quite real. If we assume that social and political institu- tions differ in their capacity to fulfill the "public good," i.e., that from a moral perspective some are more desirable than others (an assumption the 57 Nisbet, Social Change, p. 22. For a standard inter- pretation of physis, see Strauss and Cropsey, History of Political Philosophy, 2nd. ed., p. 3. 58 See Dewey, Human Nature, pp. 258-259. 5 Maturational and environmental theories can be respectively described as involving primarily assimilation or accommodation. See Kohlberg, "The Concepts of De- velopmental Psychology as the Central Guide to Educa- tion," a paper presented at the Conference on Psychology and the Process of Schooling in the Next Decade: Alterna- tive Conceptions, Minneapolis, Minn., pp. 2-3. According to the cognitive-developmental view, maturation serves to open up new possibilities, thus it constitutes a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the appearance of certain cognitive structures. The possibilities thus opened up need to be fulfilled, and for this to occur, the maturation must be reinforced by functional exercise and a minimum of ex- perience. Piaget and Inhelder, The Psychology of the Child, p. 154. Greeks clearly make), it follows that social reform is a moral matter and, in turn, that the determi- nants of moral conduct also determine the direc- tion and degree of social change. Accordingly, if the moral is a product of human nature, if it flows from that which is native or innate, then social change must follow changes in human nature: good men make good institutions. If, on the other hand, the moral is an expression of the effects of social institutions upon men (the environmental position) social change must precede changes in human nature: good men presupposes good insti- tutions. In contrast, if moral conduct is not an ex- pression entirely of human nature or environ- mental influence, but the product of the interac- tion of the two, then social progress can originate from two sources: from within man and from with- out. It is just such an argument which John Dewey employs to justify an interactional theory of de- velopment. For Dewey, neither the innate nor the environmental position offers a practical solution to social ills: the former relies on "an appeal to inner rectitude and benevolence" to elicit change, while the latter "throws us back upon accident, usually disguised as a necessary law of history or evolution, and trusts to some violent change, symbolized by civil war, to usher in an abrupt millennium."60 But this argument is not Dewey's alone. We can, for example, find the same case in Aristotle's Ethics.6" In his discussion of ethics and politics, Aristotle outlines a theory of social reform which appears to be based on an argument with no end, a vicious circle. A good polis, he writes, depends on good legislation which in turn depends on wise legislators. A wise legislator is one who knows the good, but he only comes to know the good if he is properly brought up and educated in good habits. To be properly brought up, however, requires participation in good insti- tutions; in other words, a proper education de- pends on a good polis, which in turn depends on good legislation, and so on, ad infinitum. The only way to make sense of this argument is to assume that the good is a product of the interaction between man and his environment, for then change can originate both from within man and from within his social environment. In brief, the Greek view of human nature and development is more than compatible with our 60 Dewey, Human Nature, pp. 10-l 1. 61 Aristotle Ethics Book 10. With respect to Plato's conception of social reform, it can be argued that an interactional account represents an underlying premise of the Republic. The philosopher-kings who are to construct the "ideal" state must develop their knowledge of good without the benefit of the good institutions of such a state. But on the other hand, Socrates and Glaucon hope to derive the meaning of justice from the institutions of the Republic.</page><page sequence="12">1976 Virtue, Obligation and Politics 897 cognitive-developmental account: it is equivalent to an early expression of this theory.62 Accord- ingly, the viture paradigm described by Salkever fits neatly into our developmental scheme. For Salkever there are three potentially dominant principles of human nature, each corresponding to a way of life: "If the economic life is dominated by the love of self (or of life), and the political life by love of city (and of having a 'good name' in the city), the philosophic life is controlled by the love of truth or being."63 These three ways of life cor- respond respectively to the three levels of develop- ment-preconventional, conventional and prin- cipled (Table 1)-and they form not only a hier- archy but an invariant ontogenetic sequence of development as well. In the following section we demonstrate that the obligation theory of politics is an expression of conventional thought, i.e., that the virtue paradigm includes within it the obliga- tion paradigm. In this regard we show that Machiavelli, Hobbes and Locke-all obligation theorists-base their political aims on a vision of man at the conventional level or below.64 The Politics of Obligation as Conventional Thought Machiavelli has the classical view of the rela- tionship between politics and ethics. This position is concisely described by Isaiah Berlin: "Since men are beings made by nature to live in com- munities, their communal purposes are the ulti- mate values from which the rest are derived, or with which their ends as individuals are identi- fied.... Ethics ... cannot be known save by un- derstanding the purpose and character of the polish. . ."65 The point is that without a political community men are nothing, for only within a poli- tical community will common public notions of excellence arise, thereby making it possible for men to excel-to attain virtue. Virtuosity in politics is the virtuosity of the performing artist rather than the creative artist; it is action in the presence of an audience: the performance itself. The political community is the stage, the audience and the per- 62 The major difference between the Greek view, i.e., the virtue paradigm, and the cognitive-developmental perspective is that, from the latter point of view, the Greeks confuse form and content. Fqr example, "intel- lectual virtue" has content built into it, while Stage 6 is primarily structural or organizational in character. Still, the structural component of intellectual virtue is the struc- ture of Stage 6. 63 Salkever, "Virtue," p. 82. 64 Since later stages of development are reintegrations of earlier stages, the latter are both necessary for and avail- able to the former. See footnote 12, above. Thus, while the politics of obligation is justified primarily at the conven- tional level, it is possible to appeal for support to the pre- conventional level, as Hobbes and Locke do (see Table 3). 65 Isaiah Berlin, "The Question of Machiavelli," in New York Revitew of Books, 17 (November 4, 1971), p. 23. formers, in a manner of speaking. Virtuosity is the expression of politics.66 Machiavelli is concerned about what is good for man, but he is not willing to go beyond saying that a political community is good. The political com- munity is good because without it no good of any kind is possible. There is also the thesis that the presence of a political community must entail some degree of such universal values as safety of life, in- dividual freedom, and protection from deliberately inflicted harm, and that it is such values that make a political community worthwhile to human beings. It is even arguable, as H. L. A. Hart puts it, "that a human society in which these values are not recognized at all in its morality is neither an empirical nor a logical possibility, and that even if it were, such a socety could be of no practical value for human beings."67 Machiavelli comes very close to this position when, in discussing whether or not cruelty is conducive to political stability, he says: I believe that this depends on whether cruelty is used well or ill. It may be said to be used well (if we may speak of using well a thing in itself bad) when all cruel deeds are committed at once in order to make sure of the state and thereafter discontinued to make way for the considera- tion of the welfare of the subjects. Bad use of cruelty we find in most cases where the cruel acts, though few to begin with, become more numerous with time. Those who practice the first kind may find some defense for their state in the eyes of God and man, but as far as the second class, it is impossible for them to stay in power.68 Nevertheless Machiavelli does not look upon politics as an educational process leading to moral virtue, where moral virtue entails a perspective by which to evaluate virtuosity-a perspective be- yond the community (or conventional level). Machiavelli's consuming interest is the creation and maintenance of political structure.69 By de- fault good becomes either having a "good name" in the city (which signifies the support of the politi- 66 Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?" in Between Past and Future (Cleveland, Ohio: World Publishing Company, 1963), p. 153. Arendt also makes the interesting point that Christianity understood goodness to consist of acts unrecognized by secular man as good: only in the eyes of God, so to speak, were they recognized. Goodness then was unvirtuous, which helps explain Machiavelli's animosity to the church. Arendt summarizes: " . . . the problem of religious rule over the secular realm was in- escapably this: either the public realm corrupted the re- ligious body and thereby became itself corrupt, or the religious body remained uncorrupt and destroyed the public realm (virtuosity) altogether."

On the other hand Machiavelli argues neither that might makes right nor that politics should serve private interests. So while he is not at the principled level, he is also not at the preconven- tional level. Might is not justifiable as a goal; it is justifiable only in connection with the creation and maintenance of political community. Virtuosity is justifiable as an end, but it is not possible without politics. The same can be said of might, under- stood as virtuosity, keeping in mind the kind of limitations mentioned in connection with cruelty. Neither optimistic, nor nihilistic, Machiavelli is a modified obligation theorist who fits into the virtue-developmental paradigm at the conven- tional level (see Table 3). 7 Hobbes, too, is preoccupied with the political order, but his analysis of the sources of disorder and his prescriptions for dealing with disorder distinguish him from Machiavelli. First, like Machiavelli, Hobbes does not make might equiv- alent to right. He maintains validity of moral judgment: power does in fact determine what hap- pens, but power does not make it right. Leo Strauss points this out by noting that Hobbes 70 Machiavelli's views of human nature also put him in the middle, at the conventional level. His analysis of power shows that political structure is realistic, but human beings are too wicked to make the principled level realistic. For the former, see The Prince, pp. 24-26, 34, 52; for the latter, ibid., pp. 44-45, 48, 51. distinguishes between unjust vanity and just fear of violent death. Had he not done so he would be in the naturalist camp where man's natural appetites all his passions, especially vanity are as justi- fied by nature as is reason.7' For Hobbes, power based on appetite cannot make itself right. Yet power as "common power" political structure- is the source of all right, because only it can ulti- mately check private individual desires; practically and theoretically speaking, without it appetite and reason become equally valid. -To this warre of every man against every man, this also is consequent: that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place. Where there is no common power, there is no law: where no law, no injustice. Force, and fraud, are in warre the two cardinall vertwes. Justice and injustice are none of the faculties neither of the body, nor mind. If they were, they might be in a man that were alone in the world, as well as his senses, and passions. They are qualities, that relate to men in society, not in solitude.72 In one respect Hobbes seems to assume a pre- conventional level: fear is the motive behind the reason upon which the political structure exists. On the other hand, reason is more justifiable than vanity according to nature, which does not indicate 71 Leo Strauss, The Political Philosophy of Hobbes (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), p. viii. 72 Hobbes, Leviathan (New York: Dutton, Everyman's Library, 1914), p. 66.

Hobbes seems to be both within and above the preconven- tional level. Seen from the postconventional level, in terms of the relationship of the principled or autono- mous level to the "common power" (the political order), Hobbes's statements on human nature do not warrant concluding that the cultivation of reason and truth through mutual respect, open- ness, and reciprocity will lead to justice.73 On the contrary, we think Irene Coltman's statement ac- curately reveals Hobbes's rejection of the prin- cipled level: Their [referring to such moderate advisors to the King as Falkland and Clarendon] devotion to good causes was to Hobbes a method of rebellion. Their search for truth was a way of being disobedient just as the desire to know good and evil was the primal act of disobedience. They said that ideals transcended patriotism, in order to justify their treachery and they made themselves the sole judge of what ideals they would follow: ideals that emanated from themselves and sanctified their impulses. The good king, to them, was one who had surrendered his kingship by giving up his absolute authority. The good man was the bad citizen who followed his private truth and went his own way. Insanely complacent about letting the social order fall apart, intellectuals and all private men who claimed this sort of freedom were, Hobbes thought, the enemies of society and of civiliza- tion.74 The distance between Hobbes and the princi- pled level of the virtue paradigm is evident in other interpretations of Hobbes as well. Norman Jacob- son, for example, finds in the Leviathan not the virtue paradigm's position that there is a good for man suitable to his nature, but the notion that man can master his nature. Man accomplishes this by the power of language-man's creation, not God's or nature's. Through the creation of a scientific language the problem of order is solved. Henceforth to discuss politics is to discuss geome- try; there is no time for the passions that give rise to conflicts and disorder. Objective, precise, neutralizing science becomes Leviathan. The principled or autonomous level is nowhere to be found. 73 See especially Leviathan, pp. 51-54, 64, 88. 7 Irene Coltman, Private Men &amp; Public Causes: Philosophy &amp; Politics in the English Civil War (London: Faber &amp; Faber Limited, 1962), pp. 22-23. See also pp. 140, 161, 189-191. From within the developmental paradigm Hobbes's reaction to people like Falkland and Clarendon is justified; they do not represent an authentic Stage 6. Martin Luther King and Socrates would be authentic examples, because principled thought must include as well as surpass previous stages loyalty to the political order (conventional level) must be maintained at the same time that principles are. Morality does not transcend the politi- cal realm; the political realm is the schoolhouse of morality. 7 5Norman Jacobson, Thomas Hobbes as Creator (New York: General Learning Press, 1971). Hobbes occupies a middle ground between the preconventional and the principled levels.76 No better statement to this effect exists than Strauss's: For, by starting from "right" and thus denying the primacy of "law" (or, what amounts fundamentally to the same, of "virtue"), Hobbes makes a stand against the idealistic tradition. On the other hand, by basing morals and politics on "right," and not on purely natural inclinations or appetites, Hobbes makes a stand against the naturalistic tradition. That is to say, the principle of "right" stands midway between strictly moral principles (such as those of the traditional natural law, on the one hand, and purely natural principles (such as pleasure, appetite, or even utility) on the other.77 The function of politics for Locke, as Salkever points out, is the protection of privately deter- mined enterprises: The commonwealth seems to me to be a society of men constituted only for the procuring, preserving and ad- vancing their own civil interests. Civil interests I call life, liberty, health and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things, such as money, lands, houses, furniture and the like. 7 8 This position is largely a result of Locke's views of man and philosophy.79 "What is good for man?" is not only a question beyond man's capacity to answer, it is politically irrelevant, as the practical solution is public policy that conforms to com- munity standards. Two comments by Locke help to show this: We are not born in heaven but in this world, where our being is to be preserved with meat, drink, and clothing, and other necessaries that are not born with us, but must be got and kept with forecast, care and labour, and there- fore we cannot be all devotion, all praises and hallelu- jahs, and perpetually in the vision of things above ... 80 76 The function of politics for Hobbes, according to Table 3, is "order for the sake of civil society." It is true that civil society is worthwhile because of the values it promotes-industry, culture, navigation, knowledge, arts and letters, freedom, etc. Hobbes's concern seems to be that when those values become uppermost in men's minds, then the pursuit of them may undermine civil society. It is for this reason we describe Hobbes's position as order for the sake of civil society.

This position emphasizes freedom, but without concern for evaluating what courses of action result from freedom; it is the obligation paradigm par excellence. It also describes the conventional level, because it does not offer stan- dards or methods to define moral values and prin- ciples which have validity, and application apart from the authority of the groups or persons hold- ing these principles, and apart from the individ- ual's own identification with these groups. This is readily apparent in the emphasis Locke places on society: The first and fundamental natural law ... is the preser- vation of society.... 82 [But the preservation of society is motivated by the desire for self-preservation:] The first and strongest desire God planted in man, and wrought into the very principle of their nature, being that of self-preservation.... 83 Self-preservation as the means to peace and preser- vation is not a theory of good or obligation that goes very far. Where the preservation of the society is at odds with the preservation of the individual, society must be obeyed because without society, i.e., without a set of mutual expectations based on trust, without order, freedom would not exist.84 But where the individual's life, and his freedom, therefore, is at stake this argument breaks down. Every theory exclusively committed to freedom encounters a dead end, because it does not offer a means of choosing between conflicting purposes (the presence of conflicting purposes is evidence of the existence of freedom). Where the virtue paradigm sees reason and justice as man's ends (to be served by the passions) Locke sees the passion of self-preservation. From self-preservation he arrives at freedom, but he can go no further. There is no doubt that he is not at the principled level: even the questions which lead to autonomy (Stage 6) are superfluous for Locke. Life of John Locke, 2 vols.

Also see Goldwin, "Locke," p. 483: "Logke is pro- found and comprehensive on the reasons for' founding political society, but those reasons turn out to be such that he is prevented by their very character from consider- ing in what direction society should develop after the founding is secure." Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke stop short of virtue; they do not see politics as education for justice. Given our interactional theory-moral conduct is an expression of the interaction of human nature and environment-then their his- torical circumstances help to explain why they set their sights no higher. But in more fortunate times, as in the case of classical Greece and per- haps, we venture to say, of contemporary western civilization,85 politics can be looked upon as a process for moral development, no better expres- sion of which can be found than that by John Dewey: When we observe that morals is at home wherever con- siderations of the worse or better are involved, we are committed to noting that morality is a continuing process not a fixed achievement. Morals means growth of con- duct in meaning; at least it means that kind of expansion in meaning which is consequent upon observations of the conditions and outcome of conduct. It is all one with growing. Growing and growth are the same fact ex- panded in actuality or telescoped in thought. In the largest sense of the word, morals is education. It is learning the meaning of what we are about and employ- ing that meaning in action. The good, satisfaction, "end," of growth of present action in shades and scope of meaning is the only good within our control, and the only one, accordingly, for which responsibility exists. The rest is luck, fortune.86 From our developmental perspective, Dewey's "meaning," Salkever's "truth and being," as well as our "principles and autonomy" must be under- stood as the highest stage of politics. As such they come first in importance ultimately they justify politics, yet they do not come first in time. First, politics must guarantee a minimum of security- the preoccupation of Hobbes; afford man an op- portunity to display virtuosity in the sense of per- forming exceptionally well in terms of the political community's values the preoccupation of Machi- avelli; and guarantee man freedom in return for giving up unbridled lust Locke's concern. The conventional and preconventional levels that these views exemplify do not ever simply go away, and neither do the functions of politics at the con- ventional and preconventional levels. Plato goes to great lengths to point this out; a political commu- nity always exists simultaneously at various levels: 85 James S. Coleman argues, however, that the rise of "corporate actors" restricts role-taking opportunities: " . . . when [an individual] carries out an action toward a corporate actor, he cannot see himself ever in the corporate actor's place. He will never become a corporate actor. For that reason, he will feel fewer pangs of guilt when he rips out a public telephone or steals paper from the office than he would if he had committed similar acts against a per- son." Coleman, Power and the Structure of Society (New York: Norton, 1974), p. 97. We should also state explicitly that, even in the best of environments, few persons will reach the highest levels of cognitive-moral development. See, for example, footnote 88 below. 86 Dewey, Human Nature, p. 259.</page><page sequence="16">1976 Virtue, Obligation and Politics 901 this is one message of the Republic.87 Justice as education for virtue is the end of politics, yes, but its realization (in degrees never fully) is de- pendent upon the acknowledged importance of such functions of politics as Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke had in mind. Thus politics as virtue, where education for justice is the function of politics, incorporates as well as exceeds politics as obligation. While our developmental view incorporates pol- itics as obligation (obligation fits in at the con- ventional level) there is a tension between higher and lower stages within the paradigm. In the first place, the conventional level can be understood from the principled level, but the principled level cannot be understood from the conventional level.88 Politics at the preconventional and con- ventional levels, and politics at the postconven- tional level also highlight different facets of human behavior. The politics of the preconventional and conventional levels focus on civilized man as a creature of emulation; in his effort to make some- thing of himself, i.e., to prove himself superior to others, he creates largely arbitrary, socially rec- ognized values upon which social stratification and inequality rest. Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke seem preoccupied with man in this dress. The postconventional view of politics focuses on man as he promotes equality and justice through growth and sharing, as he increasingly considers others independently of goods, status, and pres- tige, and as he enlarges the circle of others subject to his moral consideration and respect. Tension between these two views of politics exists, but reality consists of both. Moral Understanding The understanding of virtue-ethics, values, morality, or whatever term chosen is compara- ble to the understanding of such phenomena as marriage in at least two respects. First, an under- standing of virtue or marriage presupposes its ex- 87 In this respect see Bloom, Republic, pp. 307-436. For example, Bloom writes (p. 410): "He shows what a regime would have to be in order to be just and why such a regime is impossible. Regimes can be improved but never perfected; injustice will always remain. The proper spirit of reform, then, is moderation. Socrates constructs his utopia to point up the dangers of what we would call utopianism; as such it is the greatest critique of political idealism ever written. The Republic serves to moderate the extreme passion for political justice by showing the limits of what can be demanded and expected of the city; and, at the same time, it shows the direction in which the im- moderate desires can be meaningfully channeled." 88 In the "Apology" and "Crito" Socrates understands the conventional level; he is even an expression of it: his loyalty to the polis leads to his death (although his love of philosophy was a factor as well). The jury, however, is not at Socrates's principled level, and cannot appreciate his philosophic activities. What is entailed in understanding a stage is discussed below (901-903). perience, and second, a condition for the experi- ence of either- virtue or marriage is the prior accep- tance of its validity. There is a difference, for ex- ample, between the experience of marriage and the experience of a trial marriage, where the relation- ship from the outset is understood to be provi- sional. The acceptance of the validity of a lasting commitment is essential to the experience of marriage (not trial marriage); an understanding of marriage is only possible, therefore, when the validity of a lasting commitment is accepted be- forehand. Otherwise the experience of marriage and consequently, the understanding) does not oc- cur. Similarly, an acceptance of the validity of virtue makes possible a participatory (as opposed to, say, an analytic) understanding of virtue.89 Aristotle makes two comments in the Ethics which support and clarify these views. He says first, "A young man is not a proper hearer of lec- tures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these."90 Aristotle means inexperienced in a subjective sense. He does not mean, for example, someone who does not know what the word marriage means, but some- one whose social experience has been so limited that he cannot, even imaginatively, come close to understanding marriage from the inside. Aristotle is also indicating that political science involves ethics, the understanding of which depends upon participatory experience. In this regard he says, "Anyone who is to listen intelligently to lectures about what is good and noble must have been brought up in good habits."'" Aristotle makes this statement while trying to determine the nature of "good"; consequently, he seems to beg the ques- tion by referring to "good" habits. There is a rea- son for this, as Joseph Schwab points out so well: "If an argument is to appeal to experience of the inward effects and satisfactions of certain kinds of actions and undergoings, those inward effects and satisfactions must have been experienced by those the argument addresses."92 Good habits will pro- vide experiences of the inward effects and satisfac- tions to which moral arguments appeal. Piaget carries this line of reasoning further: In the same way that a kind of contradiction exists in adhering to an intellectual truth from the outside (with- out having rediscovered and reverified it), so it can be asked whether there does not exist some moral incon- sistency in recognizing a duty without having come to it by an independent method.... In other words, just as a pupil can recite his lessons without understanding them 89 Fred M.

The commitment involved in the first step is facilitated by justice, understood as the shareability of rules, roles, and relations, or rather by the mutual respect and reciprocity in- volved therein. In short, justice promotes commu- nication the experiencing of others without which development of higher stages is impossible. Piaget calls the process "decentering": We have stated that the two correlative aspects of the personality are independence and reciprocity. In con- trast to the individual who has not yet reached the stage of 'personality," and whose characteristics are to be oblivious of all rules and to center on himself whatever interrelations he has with his physical and social environ- ments, the person is an individual who situates his ego in its true perspective in relation to the ego of others. He inserts it into a system of reciprocity which implies simultaneously an independent discipline, and a basic de-centering of his own activity. The two basic problems of ethical education are, therefore, to assure this de- centering and to build this discipline.94 The processes of de-centering, communication, justice and learning merge into a complex ac- tivity, with each process contributing to the others. Justice can therefore be considered as a means to understanding and communication, as well as the result of understanding and communication.95 Development to the principled or autonomous level is the aim ofjustice as a process. Arrival at the principled level is indicated by autonomy; the appeal of such moral sensitivities as, for example, respect for persons is internal rather than external. An understanding of Stage 6 (the autonomous or principled level) is thus available only to persons at Stage 6, for if the internal appeal is not present, then the principles of the stage will neither be at- tractive nor meaningful from the inside, and if they are not appealing and meaningful from the inside, they do not constitute Stage 6. Conse- quently, the virtue paradigm (Stage 6) is not mean- ingful from the obligation perspective (Stage 4), but the obligation paradigm is understandable from the virtue perspective. Salkever, on the other hand, is neutral concerning the justifiability of the two paradigms: "I have in no way 'refuted' the legitimacy (or obligation) paradigm... 96 Our 93Piaget, To Understand Is To Invent (New York: Grossman Publishers, 1973), pp. 118-119. 94Ibid., p. 111-112. 95 Ibid., p. 117. 96 Salkever, "Virtue," p. 92. position is that understanding the virtue paradigm at Stage 6 leads to accepting the obligation paradigm as a means but not an end. The obliga- tion paradigm is an incomplete view of human nature and development; it does not go as far as the virtue paradigm does toward justice (keeping in mind that justice is open-ended, attainable only to a degree, and is not always a feasible pursuit). If virtue did not have to be understood from the inside, then justice in practice would not be neces- sary: politics would not have to provide the means, justice the reciprocity and the trust necessary to participatory understanding to the end, justice the shareability of rules, roles, and relations. Justice as a means to justice must be qualified, however, by taking into account the fact that people are at various stages of moral develop- ment. Policies that would lead to moral develop- ment in some cases would not in others. (It is necessary to deal with persons at their cognitive level.) This reaffirms the importance of the com- municative and imaginative faculties in achieving the realistic appraisal of character and conse- quences so necessary for wise moral choices. 97 The virtue paradigm's answer to "What is the best life?" is described by Salkever as rational and nonidiosyncratic, implying an objective answer that arrives at standards which hold good for all. Beyond this Salkever does not go, his purpose not requiring such a venture. To elucidate the cogni- tive-developmental perspective does require going further. The principles that emerge at Stage 6 do not say specifically what good is, but rather indi- cate considerations to which one must be sensi- tive.98 These considerations turn out to be those conducive to moral and cognitive development, keeping in mind the interdependence of moral and cognitive aspects of development. For example, sharing in social roles, the product of a certain quality of moral relationships, is vital to cognitive development, and certain cognitive skills-re- versibility, for example-are necessary for such moral relationships as reciprocity. We have noted the importance of trust and commitment in this process, and it is important to recall the movement 9 Depth of moral understanding has more to do with giving moral principles content than with grasping more and more abstract theories. Giving content to such princi- ples as impartiality, freedom, respect for persons, and consideration of interests requires an understanding of persons which is best arrived at by sharing a common life with them. Breadth of understanding is of equal impor- tance. Awareness of complexity of roles, activities, motives, and rules is important, and knowledge of historical, politi- cal, economic, and social facts is indispensable to the process of giving principles realistic content. See Peters, "Concrete Principles," pp. 53-54. 98 For an account of such principles, see Kohlberg, Table 2; Peters, "Concrete Principles," pp. 29-55, espe- cially pp. 35-44; Hart, Law, Liberty, and Morality, pp. 70- 71.</page><page sequence="18">1976 Virtue, Obligation and Politics 903 toward greater equilibrium. The goal of the devel- opmental perspective ("good") is that kind of learning or understanding that leads to further learning and understanding. Given the fact of change in both the organism and the environment, and given the interaction theory, equilibrium must be considered a continuing process dependent upon continuing understanding. In this sense the developmental perspective is rational, nonidio- syncratic, and open-ended.99 Yet understanding through justice, and justice through understanding, are not always viable pursuits. There are times when the obligation paradigm is necessary (so thought Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke of their situations), and occa- sions when preconventional sensitivities are domi- nant (Hobbes's condition of war). But even then the future can be promising; the possibilities of man and his activities in common through politics raise ever anew the possibility of justice. The superiority of the principled level of development over the conventional (obligation paradigm) is that, having experienced the conventional stage, it can employ conventional morality when neces- sary, whereas the obligation paradigm is powerless to promote principled moral and political de- velopment when opportunities to do so exist. Conclusion At the heart of Salkever's case for the virtue paradigm is the idea that ". . . there is a direct path from the political question to the human question, since we can fully answer the question of whether or how political life is choice-worthy only on the basis of an understanding of what human beings are an understanding, that is to say, of human nature."'00 Our position is also based on an understanding of human nature. We have argued that the nature of a thing is how it grows, that man grows (develops cognitively and morally) in the presence of justice, so human na- ture is to be understood in connection with justice. But the "end" of human development ac- cording to our thinking is open-ended under- standing-Dewey's concept of meaning, the kind 9 In addition to being open-ended, the developmental perspective is pluralistic: the principles of Stage 6 are not necessarily mutually compatible. The following statement by Berlin can be reconciled with a Stage 6 orientation: "The world that we encounter in ordinary experience is one in which we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate, the realization of some of which must in- evitably involve the sacrifice of others. Indeed, it is because this is their situation that men place such immense value upon the freedom to choose; for if they had the assurance that in some perfect state, realizable by men on earth, no ends pursued by them would ever be in conflict, the neces- sity and agony of choice would disappear, and with it the central importance of the freedom to choose." Isaiah Berlin, Two Concepts of Liberty (London: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1958), p. 54. 1 00 Salkever, "Virtue," p. 80. of understanding that must lead to more under- standing. Justice is sensitivity to the moral prin- ciples (see Peter's four principles, or Hart's formal values) that both produce understanding (develop- ment) and yet result from understanding. Thus human nature is human development a process of justice and understanding. Salkever's virtue paradigm centers on the ques- tion "What is good for man?" Does such an in- quiry flow from man's nature? Our argument would be yes: it is man's nature to develop, and dealing with this question is a form and a reflection of that development. Yet there seems to be a self- fulfilling hypothesis here. Once the question "What is good for man?" is entertained, the process of understanding (keeping in mind the relationship between understanding and justice) has begun, and understanding becomes the answer to the question as well as the means to answering it. Thus the significance of the question "What is good for man?" is that it reveals man's distinctive powers of understanding and justice 101 its pres- ence indicates that the processes of understanding and justice are occurring, and it makes man aware of his capacity for development through these processes, thereby encouraging their continua- tion. This does not mean moral sensitivity cannot develop without an awareness of the develop- mental process itself. Rather it suggests that the moral sensibilities (and understanding, of course, since they go together) are more likely to develop and thrive where (through literature, drama, his- tory, philosophy, religion, etc.) man's reflections of his morality are present as a continuing con- tribution to the development of understanding and morality. In this service Salkever's virtue paradigm performs well, especially when augmented by cognitive-developmental moral psychology. To grasp the nature of man's distinctive powers requires the use of those powers. This observation is similar to a point made earlier in reference to the principled or autonomous level of development: that the appeal of moral principles at this level rests upon their inward effects and satisfactions (thus "autonomous"), such that persons without the experience of those inward effects and satisfac- tions cannot understand the moral quality of those at the autonomous level. Inside understanding is necessary to grasp the inside understanding of others. Even at the conventional level of morality a person not tuned into the group will not grasp the morality of those who are. This line of reason- ing can be expanded to the generalization that it '10 Salkever notes that "Stuart Hampshire argues that any idea of human goodness depends on some idea of the 'distinctive powers of humanity.' " We are also arguing that any idea of the distinctive powers of humanity de- pends on some idea of human goodness.

To grasp the nature of man's distinctive powers requires the use of those powers.102 On the basis of a cognitive-developmental ap- proach to moral psychology we have analyzed the meaning and significance -of Salkever's two para- digms of political thought. Our first step was to 102 Compare to Strauss: "Hobbes's political philoso- phy is really, as its originator claims, based on a knowl- edge of men which is deepened and corroborated by the self-knowledge and self-examination of the individual, and not on a general scientific or metaphysical theory. And be- cause it is based on experience of human life, it can never, in spite of all the temptations of natural science, fall com- pletely into the danger of abstraction from moral life and neglect of moral difference. Hobbes's political philosophy has thus for that very reason a moral basis, because it is not derived from natural science but is founded on first- hand experience of human life," Strauss, Hobbes, p. 29. present the cognitive-developmental theory and its findings. We then analyzed the two paradigms in terms of this theory, which required placing Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Rawls within our developmental scheme. And finally, the nature of understanding moral principles was developed from the cognitive-developmental per- spective. We assume, as does Salkever, that any account of political good (public good as opposed to private) must be based on moral psychology, that it must deal with the question "What is good for the most inclusive of all publics, the human species?"''03 We, however, go two steps beyond Salkever by showing the significance of the ques- tion, and by providing an answer to it (both of which bear upon the understanding of morality). An underlying purpose of our research is to reveal and to promote the political relevance and sig- nificance of moral psychology in general, and cog- nitive-developmental psychology in particular. 1 03 Salkever, "Virtue," p. 80.</page></plain_text>
