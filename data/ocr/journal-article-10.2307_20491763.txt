<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH ARTS REVIEW FOUR IRISH ARTISTS AT THE SAO PAULO BIENAL Exhibition activity world-wide is now more diverse than ever before; inter national contemporary exhibitions have reached an unprecedented level in pro viding access to new art for a wide population. Despite, or perhaps because of, pluralism, criticism and crises, the long established biennials have main tained their standing as major influential institutions. These enterprises are events at which serious talent is given a valuable platform on which recognition can be obtained. Being represented at a major biennial is still a prize highly valued by artists throughout the world and especial ly by those artists who live outside the effective influence of the dominant art centres. The Venice Biennale, inaugurated in 1895 and the Sao Paulo Bienal, launched more than half a century later, in 1951, are the two longest running of these exhibitions. The Paris Biennale began a little later and its continuing cuitural importance can be gauged by the French Government's commitment this year to investing two million pounds in its presentation. In his historical survey of the Venice Biennale 1895 -1968; Lawrence Alloway records that "in 1966 the Biennale showed 2,785 works by artists from thirteen countries; attend ance was 181,383 with eight hundred art critics, journalists and free-wheelers in addition". At the Sao Paulo Bienal in 1983, works exhibited numbered 1,000 by 200 artists from forty-three countries and attendance was estimated at over 200,000. Statistical evidence demons trates that 'as a spectator sport biennials are difficult to beat'. The artistic objec tives are more complicated as these alter to accommodate artists' demands and to recognize the continuously changing nature of art activity. Organizers of these large and complex exhibitions acknow ledge that there have been 'ups and downs' in the fortunes of the events and accept the 'heat and steam' generated as inevitable. Over the years the Sao Paulo Bienal has shown works by the most celebrated artists of the time, including Picasso, Leger, Giacometti, Rothko, Segall, Calder, Guston, Dubuffet and many others equally well known, together with groups and individual artists illustrating all the major and minor movements in art of the past fifty years. This year, the 18th Sao Paulo Bienal This year, for the first time,. work by artists from Ireland will be shown at the Biennial Exhibition at Sao Paulo, Brazil. Brian Ferran, Visual Arts Director of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, comments on the achievement of the four Irish exhibitors. will welcome, for the first time, a group of artists from Ireland. It will provide an opportunity to measure their achieve ment against their peers from other countries and show to a wider world something of current visual art practice in Ireland. The visual arts here are now in a healthy and vital state and the expectation of a new generation of artists is high. It is appropriate that some of these expectations should be fulfilled through participation in this event. The four artists selected - Anne Carlisle, Felim Egan, Mary FitzGerald and Eilis O'Connell - emerged during the late seventies and early eighties when there was a radical renewal of the technical and stylistic character of visual arts in Ireland. These artists showed new un expected freedoms, directions and experiences; this happened without a perceptible break with the past. By sifting through all art history they have shaken themselves free and open to main-stream energy and sophisticated cosmopolitan currents. The point of departure common to all four is the purely formal experimentation with accepted positions of international painting and sculpture. They share intel ligent, subtle and strong commitment to their work and form a loose union of independent spirits finding styles and subject matter wherever appropriate in the domestic environment, in the recent or distant past, in music, in ritual or in myth from civilizations anywhere in the world. They have all studied and exhibit ed extensively in Ireland and abroad. All four have received Arts Council bursaries and Guinness Peat Aviation Awards for Emerging Artists. In addition Felim Egan and Eilis O'Connell have exhibited at the Paris Biennale, at ROSC '84 and both received fellowships which enabled them to work for a year at the British School in Rome. It is expected that the 18th Sao Paulo Bienal will be a sensitive barometer and an accurate reflection of the state of art in the middle of this decade and it is appropriate and valuable that these four artists will participate. The Bienal will focus on two areas which the organizers have defined. The first section will include those artists who 'bring to the public a new set of values deriving from social problems and women's move ments; the importance of personality (life, biology, anthropomorphism), auto biography (where 'persona' psyche, human condition and art are somewhat interwoven); theatrical cult and tempor ality. The second section will embrace artists from anywhere in the world who have made "any significant contribution to the development of contemporary art". The autobiographical subject of Anne Carlisle's six works is the traditional still life, painted in mixed media on board, but with each painting accompanied by a related piece of free-standing sculpture or object made from cut-out cardboard shapes. Each object resembles a painted slab, pot or coloured ceramic sculpture. The objects relate in subject, colour, form and pattern to the paintings they accompany. She establishes a tripartite relationship between the subject, the painting, and the object, with each referr ing to the other. These works dominate their spaces and evoke remembered photographs of Cubist Theatre. She describes these new works, from a series which she has entitled Bird Jug and Blue Vase and Many Friends, as "an amalgam of things I like; each object to me a happy discovery, which in the works become transformed, condensed, flat tened, located in space, and made more substantial. What comes out in the end is a series of conglomerate images". These works are slightly more formal than earlier paintings in which she shattered ideograms on canvas and paper; animals, birds, buildings, cameras, jugs, tables and other familiar objects. She continues to bring the objects together, to play with them skilfully and redistri bute them over the surface. She con stantly presents the possibility of multiple interpretations in these images which are wry, witty and intelligent. Her use of colour is as intuitive as her creation of structure and just as complex. She is a clear inheritor of the Fauvist tradition. Her works are about many issues, includ ing colour, but it is colour that gives her multi-layered meanings voice. She seeks a -54</page><page sequence="2">IRISH ARTS REVIEW FOUR IRISH ARTISTS AT THE SAO PAULO BIENAL sophisticated means of allusive express ion, combining the best qualities of the seen and the experienced. This quest is manifest in different ways; in the variety of means; in the gestural or doodle-like nature of her drawing; in the oscillation between the painterly and the linear; in the two dimensional and the three dimensional and in the apparent random ordering of the surface. Figurative ident- ,. ity is abstracted and she is constantly sensitive to the internal properties of her 9 . pictures. The messages her work contains are tempered by technical knowledge, by discipline, by intelligent forethought. With playful and child-like gaiety she pokes fun gently and her apparently simple works are in reality the ultimate in refinement, attained by a spontaneity that is the result of masterful technique. Felim Egan's eight canvases further extend the theme he is now exploring of combining figures from classical mytho logy with abstract elements. He convinces us of the reality of his forms by the contin nuity and flow of his rhythmic line, by the mathematical logic of his space relations and by an individual use of twentieth century art and Greco-Roman reference. His canvases are prose rather than poetry paintings which evoke Odysseus; it could be postulated that he has in mind the Joycean reconstruction of the Homeric hero's voyage. However impersonal these Classical and Renaiss ance references are, they remain master pieces of the grand gesture and appear natural and spontaneous. He uses these references to pursue a need to express dislocation, tensions and feelings about force, about sexuality. The metaphor ically rich story of Hercules and Antaeus provides a theme around and upon which he weaves variations, as would a composer upon a musical motif. The specific images are loaded with meanings of love, death, beauty, courage and aggression. The result is provocative, disruptive and disorientating.

The overlaid drawing in these new works refers to monumental scale but there is an abundance of effect within the drawings. The lines respond _ to reference points on the supporting grid and provide a synthesis of his abstract and figurative preoccupations. He describes these new works as " explor o ing the connotations of the imagery, for example, the disorientation and sub sequent defeat of Antaeus by Hercules. I am working within the balance of tensions between grid and gestural, rational and chance, female against male, _ _ &gt; active against passive, etc., having these _ | _'\r w opposing elements in co-existence yet * _: \ retaining the disharmony and friction between them." Mary FitzGerald is represented by two large works. Axis II Light to Dark com prises twenty square canvases each 24" x 24" and Axis III Dark to Light comrpises eight canvases each 24" x 24".

Rur] phors that vanish and reappear, traces of lines that never define the forms they evoke. Spatial structures are a particular concern in her work and she endeavours to find a definite relationship between motive and lay-out of the painting. Whole images emerge out of self-contained fragments and extend a vision which is polished, articulate and rich in accomp lishment. Although quiet and con cerned with private introspection, she has found her vehicle and uses it success fully. She has mastered it but is not satisfied in knowing it well; she wants to find its roots, its essence and its full meaning. Eilis O'Connell describes her seven wall sculptures as being "motivated by the unfamiliar in what I see. I have been increasingly influenced by pre-historic Irish art and the primitive art of other cultures. I am intrigued by the often functional use of objects not made to be art as we know it, but made with the belief that the object can possess a separate spirit of energy". She accepts the primary condition of sculpture sometimes consciously and other times intuitively. Her formalist sculpture is a living language in which new thought finds form by extending the medium itself rather than borrowing from an alien language or attempting to invent a new one. The prevalent material of her sculp ture is pliable and malleable steel and her medium is space. She does not describe steel but enjoys its uncomplicat ed strength. A bowed steel piece, re sembling a farm implement, or pitch fork and inverted worn spade blade coalesce in Diggerbird and incorporate elements of surrealist humour. In Zuni Waters a curved edge of a low relief, sprung and held in delicate balance like a bow, keys the whole structure. Through associated harmonies she establishes formal equilibrium. She is concerned to go beyound the appearance of an object into a world of metaphor and enchant ment without losing sight of the material. She vests her object like Island with magic, mystery and menace. She chooses elements for their abstract qualities and embodies these in works which are about movement, lightness, strength and a certain kind of tension or balance. Her quest for harmony and order beneath the surface of chaos accommodates sug gestive associations of myth and ritual. This derives in part from the use of soft organic materials like cord, feathers and handmade paper and a preoccupation with archaeological remains, sites and artifacts. These references can be North -57 or South American or Celtic or Eskimo as in Inuit Bay. Her work never lapses into sculptural rhetoric but explores, then consolidates and refines to elicit positive response. These works herald new departures which confirm the view that her strength resides in the precision of her rigorous self-judgment. The exhibition opened at the Arts Council Gallery, Belfast, in April and was at the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork, in May. After the Sao Paulo Bienal, which runs from 4 October to 15 December, the exhibition will be shown at two galleries in Brazil; Museu de Arte do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre and Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro. When it returns in 1986 it will be shown in Kilkenny, Waterford, Galway, Limerick and Derry. The exhibition is presented in Brazil by GPA Group Ltd. and the Cultural Relations Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs and is toured in Ireland by the Arts Councils. A fully illustrated catalogue (price ?3 sterling plus post and packing) is available from the Arts Council Gallery, Bedford Street, Belfast. Brian Ferran</page></plain_text>
