<plain_text><page sequence="1">Food Tolerances and Action Levels: Do They Adequately Protect Children? H. Babich and D. L. Davis The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires the FDA and the EPA to set ac- ceptable levels for toxicants in foods. The methods used by these agencies do not adequately protect children, a high-risk group that is hypersusceptible to many of these contaminants, especially heavy metals and pesticides. (Accepted for publica- tion 23 December 1980) Developmental embryology has long indicated the heightened susceptibility of young organisms to toxicants. Despite some detailed scientific research on dif- ferential responses between young and adult organisms, most regulatory stan- dards for exposure to environmental contaminants in food are set for the more tolerant adults rather than for the more sensitive younger populations. Environmental contaminants in foods are of particular concern for three major reasons: First of all, aside from self- sufficient farmers, individuals typically have limited control over their exposure; everyone must eat food to live. Second- ly, food both nourishes for the present and introduces potentially long-lasting substances that affect future develop- ment and reproductive capacities. Final- ly, average doses relative to body size for the young are substantially higher than those for adults. The higher average exposure of the young and unborn, to- gether with their greater sensitivity, sug- gests the need for concerted regulatory attention. Standards set only for adults may not protect the young. This three- part paper briefly details federal moni- toring for contaminants in food; federal methods for establishing acceptable lev- els of contaminants in food; and some scientific research on the differential re- sponses of young and adult organisms to toxicants. Chemical contaminants of food derive from multiple sources, including indus- Babich was senior staff scientist, Toxic Substances Program, Environmental Law Institute, 1346 Con- necticut Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, and is now research scientist, Department of Biology, New York University, 952 Brown Building, New York, NY 10003; Davis is director, Toxic Substances Pro- gram, Environmental Law Institute, 1346 Connecti- cut Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036. ? 1981 American Institute of Biological Sciences.

For example, the solder used for joining the seams in metal food and bev- erage containers is a major source of dietary exposure to lead (Pb). Some of the Pb leaches from the solder through cracks or pores in the protective shellac coating applied to the inside of the can (Settle and Patterson 1980). The acciden- tal mixing of a polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) fire retardant with animal feed supplements in Michigan in 1973 exem- plifies industrial mishaps.1 Application of pesticides to protect crops may leave residues of the parent compounds, as well as their degradation products, on the edible portions of the treated plants. For instance, levels of the pesticide dibromochloropropane (DBCP) were detected in cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, cucumber, oranges, and lemons. In 1961 studies indicated that DBCP adversely affected reproduc- tion; and in 1976 workers manufacturing and handling the pesticide discovered that they experienced adverse reproduc- tive effects (Babich et al. 1981). More recent research shows that DBCP is a carcinogen (EPA 1979a). The naturally occurring fungus Asper- gillus flavus, which may occur on pea- nuts, corn, and other edible crops, pro- duces a toxicant called aflatoxin. One of the most potent known carcinogens, aflatoxin is also a mutagen and an acute- 'The PBB eventually contaminated meat, milk, and eggs in 60 of Michigan's 73 counties, exposing many Michigan residents to PBB-contaminated foods (OTA 1979). Although no overt clinical symptoms were noted in children that consumed PBB-contam- inated foods (Barr 1980) cognitive performance of PBB-exposed children may have been adversely affected. Michigan children with fat levels exceeding 100 ppb PBB performed more poorly on four of five subtests of the McCarthy scales than did nonex- posed children (Seagull 1978). ly hepatotoxic agent for the more sus- ceptible species of laboratory animals (Wilson 1979). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmet- ic Act empowers the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) to es- tablish maximum levels for toxicants in foods. EPA sets standards for residues of pesticides on or in foods, and FDA sets standards for other added chemicals that may be deleterious to human health. These agencies formulate either action levels or tolerances for the maximum concentrations of chemicals permitted on or in foods (see glossary of food safety terms and acronyms). A tolerance is a regulation, adopted through formal rule making, which has the "force of law." Thus, a tolerance cannot be ques- tioned by any court. An action level is an "informal judgment" of the quantity of contaminant in a food that will not ad- versely affect human health. It repre- sents a commitment by the federal agen- cies to initiate regulatory enforcement action against foods containing excess levels of the contaminant (OTA 1979). A list of some action levels and tolerances is presented in Table 1. To determine the dietary intake of contaminants, since 1965 FDA has been monitoring the concentrations of con- taminants in selected foods (the Market Basket Survey). The U.S. Department of Agriculture compiled in 1965 a diet sur- vey for 15- to 20-year-old American males-the group consuming the great- est amount of calories, also therefore contaminants, in any age-sex group in the population. Over a 14-day period, the average intake of this group includes 117 food items. At times throughout the year, these Market Basket items are pur- chased in various geographic regions in the United States and analyzed for con- taminants as part of composite food classes (e.g., dairy products, root vege- tables, leafy vegetables) (Mahaffey et al. 1975). June 1981 429</page><page sequence="2">In 1975, the FDA expanded the Mar- ket Basket Survey to the Total Diet Studies, by adding analyses of environ- mental contaminants in the diets of in- fants and toddlers along with that of adults, based on the American male teenager (Johnson and Manske 1977, Johnson et al. 1979). The surveillance program was extended to include the dietary intake of young children because "the infant and toddler age groups are believed to be the most sensitive and seriously affected age groups to such contaminants" (FDA 1979a). To a limited extent, FDA has recog- nized the greater sensitivity of children to toxicants in foods. Thus, the agency set the action level of 0.3 ppm Pb in evaporated milk specifically to protect children (FDA 1974a, 1979b) and set the lowest level detectable (0.1 ppm) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) for in- fant and junior foods (FDA 1972). The PCB standard reflected the fact that the sensitivity of children to PCB was evi- dent in the 1968 mass poisoning that occurred in Japan. Poor growth in schoolchildren was observed one year after the incident; followup examinations in 1970 and 1971 showed that this growth suppression was only temporary (Yoshi- mura and Ikeda 1978). However, there may be subtle, as yet undetected, effects on the reproductive system. Ten mg PCB given to rats on the second and third day of life induced precocious pu- berty, persistent vaginal estrus, and an- ovulation by 6 months of age, the latter being signs of reproductive aging that normally occur later in life (Gellert 1978). Yet, higher levels are allowed in foods that infants and juniors may eat. For practical reasons no special levels are set either for adults of reproductive age who may become parents or for pregnant and lactating women who nour- ish the unborn and nursing infants. EPA METHODS The Federal Fungicide, Insecticide, and Rodenticide Act requires that pesti- cides distributed and utilized in the Unit- ed States be registered with EPA. If the pesticide is to be used in or on foods, EPA-under the auspices of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-must establish tolerances for the pesticide res- idues on the treated crops or foods. As part of the registration process, the peti- tioner (the manufacturer of the pesticide) must submit chemical residue and toxi- cological data to EPA.2 The same crite- ria are used to set tolerances and action GLOSSARY OF FOOD SAFETY TERMS AND ACRONYMS ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) - NOEL . (Safety Factor from 2 to 2000). Average Body Weight of Consumer = 60 kg for EPA; 70 kg for FDA. Average Weight of Food Consumed Daily = 1.5 kg. Food Factor = percentage of standard diet made up of the food in question. Food Tolerances = MPI - (Food Factor x 1.5). MPI (Maximal Permitted Intake) = ADI x Average Body Weight of Consumer. NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) = level that evokes no negative response in the most sensitive species. Safety Factor = 100 for most, 2000 for insufficiently tested pesticides. TMRC (Theoretical Maximum Residue Concentration) = X Food Tolerances x Food Factors. levels. EPA does not require the peti- tioner to submit experimental data com- paring the sensitivities of young and adult animals to pesticides. In determining a tolerance for a pesti- cide, EPA estimates a level of daily exposure-the "acceptable daily in- take" (ADI)-that will not evoke a dele- terious response during a human life- time. The ADI is based on the "no observed effect level" (NOEL), derived from animal toxicological studies, which is that level that does not evoke the deleterious response observed at higher concentrations (see glossary). Weight loss, reduction in weight gain, alteration in organ weight, and inhibition of cholin- esterase activity are some of the symp- toms considered when establishing the NOEL (SGPT 1978, 1979). The ADI for human beings, expressed in mg/kg body wt, is computed by divid- ing the NOEL in the most sensitive animal species by an arbitrary safety factor. Usually, the safety factor is 100, representing two assumptions: (a) that human beings are 10 times more sensi- tive to the toxicant than is the most sensitive animal species and (b) that the range of susceptibility to the toxicant varies by a factor of 10 in the human population. For cholinesterase inhibi- tors, because laboratory animals and hu- man beings have approximately the same sensitivity, a safety factor of 10 is ap- plied. When setting temporary toler- ances for pesticides for which there are insufficient toxicological data, a safety factor of 2000 is applied (SGPT 1978). Thereafter, the ADI is converted to the 2The chemical residue data consist of the methods used to identify and quantify the pesticide residues in or on foods. The required toxicological data include acute oral toxicity; 90-day subchronic oral toxicity in rodents; 90-day subchronic oral toxicity in dogs; acute delayed neurotoxicity in hens; terato- genicity; reproductive effects (may be combined with teratogenicity); dog or rat metabolism; mouse oncogenicity; rat oncogenicity; chronic feeding study (may be combined with rat oncogenicity); chronic feeding study in dogs for two years; and mutagenicity (SGPT 1978, 1979). "maximal permitted intake" (MPI), which is the product of the ADI and the average adult body weight (see glossa- ry). EPA assumes that the average body weight is 60 kg (EPA undated); FDA assumes it to be 70 kg (OTA 1979). The next step is to establish the specif- ic food tolerances or action levels and to compute the "theoretical maximum resi- due concentration" (TMRC). EPA sets the tolerance or action level based on the toxicological and residue data submitted by the petitioner. A tolerance reflects the concentration of pesticide residue likely to remain on the food following the use of the pesticide, according to "good agri- cultural practice" or the level needed for crop protection (EPA undated). The TMRC represents the total pesti- cide residue contributions of all existing and proposed tolerances, according to the percentage of the standard diet that each food type constitutes (termed "food factors"); so TMRC = 1(food tolerances)(food factors). For example, the food factors for asparagus, carrots, corn, and tomatoes are 0.23, 0.55, 1.19, and 3.34%, respectively (EPA 1978b). As milk can comprise 100% of the diet of infants, the food factor for milk is very large in comparison to other foods (SGPT 1978, 1979). Then the MPI and TMRC, which is based on a daily intake of 1.5 kg of food, are compared. If the MPI is greater than the TMRC, the tolerances are accept- able; when the TMRC exceeds the MPI, the proposed tolerances are unaccept- able. The computations for the herbicide metolachlor serve as an example. The toxicological data submitted to EPA in- cluded a 90-day rat-feeding study with a NOEL of 300 ppm, which is equivalent to an intake of 15 mg/kg body wt/day. Application of a 2000-fold safety factor yielded an ADI of 0.0075 mg/kg body wt/ day (i.e., 15/2000 = 0.0075) and an MPI of 0.45 mg/day (i.e., 0.0075 x 60 = 0.45). Based on food tolerances of 0.1 ppm for corn grain and soybeans and BioScience Vol. 31 No. 6 430</page><page sequence="3">0.02 ppm for milk, dairy products, and meat, the TMRC was 0.015 mg/day for a 1.5 kg diet. As the TMRC was much smaller than the MPI, the tolerances were accepted (EPA 1978a). For pesticides that are oncogenic or mutagenic, EPA assumes that a "no threshold level" exists and that these effects may occur at any concentration of the pesticide. For mutagenic or onco- genic pesticides, linear dose-response calculations assess risks of ingesting food residues. An economic analysis as- certains the costs and benefits of discon- tinuing the use of the pesticide and of using alternative means for pest control (SGPT 1979). FDA METHODS The FDA sets tolerances and action levels for unavoidable residues of indus- trial chemicals, such as PCB, and for toxic residues that are unavoidable by good manufacturing practices, such as Pb in "tin" cans. In contrast to EPA, FDA does not have the authority to require toxicological and residue data from petitioners. Whereas EPA sets standards for pesticides that will be used, FDA (in most situations) must determine acceptable levels for contami- nants that already are in the environment and present in foods. Due to the lack of toxicological data, FDA cannot use a uniform procedure in evaluating information and determining appropriate levels of tolerances and ac- tion levels (OTA 1979). Generally FDA follows the methods used by EPA for evaluating pesticides. Thus, in establish- ing the action level for Pb in evaporated milk, FDA computed NOEL, ADI, MPI, and TMRC values (FDA 1974a, 1979b). However, when establishing the contro- versial action levels for mercury (Hg) in fish and shellfish, FDA computed an ADI based, not on a NOEL value, but on "the lowest level that caused an effect" (FDA 1974b). METHODOLOGY EVALUATION There are five distinct reasons why the methods that EPA and FDA use to set tolerances and action levels may not be adequate to protect young children from environmental contaminants in foods (SGPT 1978, 1979): * In calculating the TMRC, the agencies ignore nonfood exposure. For example, ingestion of toxicants by pica, the habit of mouthing or ingesting inedible ob- Table 1. Tolerances (T) and action levels (AL) for some pesticides in selected food items.

Neither is con- sidered when computing a TMRC based on food intake. * The use of standardized food factors based on consumption patterns of the American male teenager ignore the es- sentially dairy diet of infants. * The safety factor of 10 allows for vari- ability among the adult population, but may not account for the greater sensitiv- ity of children. * Synergistic or additive interactions be- tween contaminants are typically not considered when setting tolerances. Re- search with adult animals has clearly demonstrated these effects, but few, if any, laboratory studies have elucidated them in immature animals. The need for regulatory agencies to recognize such interactions between food contaminants or between other environmental risks has been stressed (Davis 1979); howev- er, at present, there are no methods that successfully integrate risk assessments for regulatory policy. Moreover, few studies have focused on the sensitivity of neonates to the metabolic or degradation products of the parent chemical, al- though these products may be more tox- ic than the parent compound itself (e.g., as with the insecticide Ornithine). * The agencies do not require the manu- facturer of a pesticide to submit experi- mental data on the differential sensitiv- ities of young and adult animals, even though young children, as well as adults, will be exposed to the pesticides.3 How- 3The Study Group on Pesticide Tolerances (SGPT 1979) has concluded that, in most cases, a two- generation reproduction study will provide adequate data to evaluate whether newborns are more sensi- tive to the toxic effects of a specific chemical than are adult animals. If the results of the two-generation reproduction study indicate an increased sensitivity of immature animals to a pesticide, EPA will take appropriate action such as using special "extrapola- tion factors" whenever young animals are found to be more sensitive than adults. These extrapolation factors would result in a lower estimate of the ADI for infants (E. H. Clark, Acting Assistant Adminis- trator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances, EPA, personal communications). ever, for drugs proposed for use in hu- man neonates, FDA recommends that pharmaceutical manufacturers submit, with their drug application, acute toxici- ty studies in one or more species com- paring newborn with adult animals. A compilation of such data (for some ex- amples, see Table 2) that has been sub- mitted to FDA has demonstrated that, of the 285 studies, there were 242 instances where young animals exhibited greater sensitivity than adults (Goldenthal 1971). The hypersensitivity of children to en- vironmental contaminants results from such factors as their small body size, developmental immaturity, genetic pre- disposition, and nutritional deficiencies (Calabrese 1978). Body Size As adults consume more food (in g/ day) than do children, adults are exposed to comparatively more contaminants in ingested foods. However, because the size of the individual determines the con- centration or dose, children consume proportionately more contaminants. When correlating food intake to body weight, the relative daily food intake (in g food/kg body wt/day) is greatest for infants, intermediate for toddlers, and lowest for adults. Furthermore, when contaminant dietary intake is correlated with body weight, the 1975 Total Diet Survey indicated that infants are ex- posed to higher dietary levels than are adults for the pesticides DDE, TDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), benzene- hexachloride (BHC), pentachloroani- line (PCA), pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), toxaphene, malathion, and bo- tran and for the metals Pb, cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and seleni- um (Se). Similarly, based on relative daily food intake, toddlers are exposed to greater levels than are adults for DDE, TDE, HCB, BHC, PCA, PCNB, toxa- phene, botran, dieldrin, thiodan sulfate, lindane, leptophos, Pb, Cd, Zn, As, and Se (FDA 1979a). June 1981 431</page><page sequence="4">An infant's diet is predominantly dairy, and a toddler's diet also contains a large proportion of dairy foods. Pesticide residues found in dairy commodities in- clude DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor, all organochlorines. Although minimum safety margins (based on the tolerance levels divided by the maximum residues) have been set for each of these sub- stances, they do not account for the results of experiments testing the sensi- tivities of young and adult laboratory animals to certain pesticides and heavy metal-containing compounds. Of the more than 250 compounds tested, imma- ture animals were found to be more sensitive than their adult counterparts to nearly all test chemicals. For example, young rats were at least 3 times as sensi- tive as adults to the insecticide hepta- chlor and possibly as much as 180 times as sensitive to the herbicide trifluralin (Goldenthal 1971). The organochlorines (including DDE, DDT, HCB, BHC, PCB, and TCDD) are particularly noteworthy when consider- ing potential threats to nursing infants. Due to their common physical and chem- ical properties, they are persistent as well as fat-soluble. Thus, after such a chemical enters an organism, it leaves the blood and accumulates in fat reser- voirs of the body. The higher an animal is in the food chain, the greater its con- centration of organochlorines. The only means of ridding the body of these resi- dues is through fat loss, weight decrease, or lactation (during lactation, organo- chlorines are excreted following their incorporation into milkfat, Harris 1981). A breast-fed infant can be expected to be especially vulnerable to exposure to organochlorines as well as other toxic substances. A human excretes 25% more DDT than daily intake of DDT in milk, as compared with a lactating cow, which excretes only 1.5% of its daily intake of DDT in this manner. Thus, the human has stored much more DDT in its fat reserves (McKercher and Plapp 1980). In 1976, EPA did an analytical study of pesticides and other organic residues in human milk. It was estimated that the average American nursing infant con- sumed 1.8 ppm PCB daily. FDA recom- mends an acceptable exposure of 1 mg PCB/kg body wt/day for infants (which may actually be too high); this converts to a daily recommended limit of 0.17 ppm PCB in milkfat. Simple arithmetic shows that breast-fed infants are receiv- ing 10 times this dose (Harris 1981). Many organochlorines (including DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor) are known carcinogens. This is an alarming fact in light of increased infant exposure to them as well as apparent infant hyper- susceptibility to carcinogens. There is no accurate estimate of the cancer risk to breast-fed infants. ADIs are not suffi- cient to indicate chronic rather than acute risks (Harris 1981). As a response to the data that breast- feeding may expose their infants to un- due risk, some mothers may choose to nurse only for the first few days. This gives their infants the benefit of colos- trum (pre-milk secretions which are criti- cal for immunological protection) and the more nutritious early breast milk. But it can also be richer in pesticide residues; studies indicate that organo- chlorine residues in breast milk decline the longer a woman lactates (Harris 1981). Further, breast-fed infants, as op- posed to bottle-fed infants, are exposed to a broader range of apophilic, organo- chlorine pesticides, because the source is a mother's more varied diet. There are some reported clinical cases of the hypersensitivity of children to pesticides and other contaminants. Aplastic anemia was diagnosed in a two- year-old exposed to lindane during a three-month period in which a prepara- tion containing the pesticide was used to treat the family dog for mange. Neither the child's nine-year-old brother nor its father, both of whom were also exposed, exhibited clinical symptoms (Vodopick 1975). A review suggests the association of lindane with such hematotoxic effects, although in some cases multiple pesti- cide exposures occurred and exposure evidence was largely anecdotal. Of the 46 alleged hematotoxic injuries implicat- ing lindane, most involved consumer products such as vaporizers, sprays, dog shampoos, powder, or dust. In two cases the causal role of lindane was beyond question; both involved young children that developed aplastic anemia (Morgan et al. 1980). In the early 1960s, in Antofagasta, Chile, some dermatologic problems and deaths, "particularly among children," were linked to As contamination of a water supply. In 1955, more than 10,000 Japanese infants were fed a powdered milk formula contaminated with As. The infants exhibited clinical symptoms of As poisoning, most of which disappeared six months after the exposure stopped. Table 2.

BioScience Vol. 31 No. 6 432</page><page sequence="5">Follow-up studies of these youths as teenagers noted increased incidences of mental retardation and epilepsy; appar- ently, early exposure to As has latent neurologic sequelae (EPA 1979b). There are several distinctions between the susceptibility and clinical symptoma- tology of children and adults to Pb toxici- ty. Lead poisoning occurs in adults when the concentration exceeds 80 ug Pb/100 mL blood, whereas in children Pb poi- soning may occur at levels as low as 30 jig Pb/100 mL blood (NAS 1980). Also, sudden onset of encephalopathy without prior clinical manifestations is not infre- quent in children 15 to 30 months of age, less frequent in older children, and un- usual in adults. Furthermore, children are more susceptible to the adverse ef- fects of Pb on heme synthesis and, thus, hemoglobin production (McCabe 1979). Developmental Maturity Until the age of two to three months, human fetuses and neonates have imma- ture hepatic detoxification systems (Pel- konen et al. 1973, Rane and Ackerman 1972), as do newborn rabbits (Fouts and Adamson 1959), mice, guinea pigs (Jon- dorf et al. 1958), rats (Kato et al. 1964), and other experimental animals. This developmental immaturity may predis- pose infants to toxicants ingested with their foods. It is strongly suggested that human infants are deficient in functional hepatic glucuronidation systems and, thus, are predisposed to the toxicity of phenolic compounds and PCB (Cala- brese 1978). The antibody-immune systems of young children are not fully developed. Serum levels of IgM reach adult titer at 1 year of age, of IgG at 7 years of age, and IgA between 10 and 12 years of age (Calabrese 1978). Toxicants ingested with foods may delay or depress the normal development of the immune sys- tem, thereby increasing the susceptibil- ity of children to viral and bacterial in- fections. Mice exposed to Cd, either in drinking water or by injection, exhibited reductions in the appearance of IgM- and IgG-forming cells (Bozelka et al. 1978; Koller et al. 1975). Infants are particularly sensitive to the nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) content of foods. The lack of gastric acidity in the infant permits colonization of the upper portion of the stomach by bacteria capable of reducing NO3- to NO2-, which interacts with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, a compound that cannot reversibly bind molecular oxygen. When the methemoglobin concentration ex- ceeds 70%, asphyxia occurs (Wolff and Wasserman 1972). Infantile methemoglo- binemia has been noted in infants fed foods rich in NO2- and NO3- (e.g., Keat- ing et al. 1973, Simon 1966). The levels of NO2- and NO3- in infant and toddler foods analyzed by FDA were found to be insufficient to pose a health hazard to young children (FDA 1979a). Suckling laboratory animals were more sensitive to Cd, Hg, manganese (Mn) (Kostial et al. 1978), iron (Fe), and Pb (Goldenthal 1971) and exhibited greater gastrointestinal absorption of these metals (Forbes and Reina 1972, Koller 1980, Kostial et al. 1978) than adult animals. The greater susceptibility to heavy metals may result from (a) their milk diet, which has been shown to fa- cilitate gastrointestinal absorption of metals (Kello and Kostial 1973) and (b) the nonselective permeability of the un- developed intestinal barrier in young ani- mals (Jugo 1977). Similarly, children may exhibit greater gastrointestinal absorption of ingested metals than adults. Adults typically ab- sorb only 10% of the ingested Pb gas- trointestinally (Kehoe 1961, Rabinowitz et al. 1974),, but children absorb from 41 to 53% (Alexander et al. 1974, Ziegler et al. 1978). Furthermore, the distribution of met- als in the body organs differs between young and adult animals. Higher levels of Mn (Chandra and Shukla 1978), Pb (Keller and Doherty 1980a, b, Kostial et al. 1978, Moncilovic and Kostial 1974), and Hg (Jugo 1976) accumulate in the brain of suckling animals than in adult animals, suggesting a greater neurotoxic- ity to young animals. Learning ability, as measured by performance on a T-maze, decreased in 8- to 10-week-old rats that had nursed dams treated with Pb after birth. Interestingly, the Pb doses did not produce overt symptoms of Pb toxicity in either the pups or dams. This indicates that subtle neurotoxicities such as learn- ing deficits may occur at levels of Pb exposure that do not evoke overt symp- toms (Brown 1975). Similarly, although no overt symp- toms were noted in monkeys dosed oral- ly with 500 jLg Pb/kg/day from day 1 of life, at 2 to 3 years of age these animals exhibited retarded learning behavior (Rice and Willes 1979). Furthermore, the reproductive potential of young animals is sensitive to subclinical levels of Pb. Altered production and release of folli- cle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland was evident in newborn male and female rats fed daily doses of 25, 100, or 200 mg/kg Pb (Petrusz et al. 1979). In young children, Pb exposure at doses below those producing clinical symptoms has also been associated with subtle neurophysiologic deficits. Chil- dren living near a smelter and exhibiting no overt symptoms of Pb toxicity, but with concentrations of 40 to 68 Jig Pb/100 mL blood, had lower I.Q. levels than "control" children with less than 40 jxg Pb/100 mL blood (Landrigan et al. 1975). Children with higher levels of Pb (i.e., 24 ppm) in their teeth scored significantly lower on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised), on verbal tests, on measures of auditory and speech processing, and on a measure of atten- tion, than did those with lower levels (i.e., 6 ppm) of dentine Pb. Furthermore, double-blind controlled reports of non- adaptive classroom behavior increased in a dose-response pattern with increas- ing levels of dentine Pb (Needleman et al. 1979). Studies in Greece indicate ele- vated levels of serum Pb in children with mental retardation of unknown etiology as compared to normal children or chil- dren with mental retardation of known (e.g., genetic) etiology (Youroukos et al. 1978). Mahaffey (1977) has suggested that the level of 300 jIg Pb/day-which FDA con- sidered as the "maximum daily permissi- ble intake" of Pb from all sources for children between one and three years of age and used in setting action levels for Pb (FDA 1974a, 1979b)-is unsuitable to protect children. This value was mistak- enly based on a 10% gastrointestinal absorption of ingested Pb. Due to the higher gastrointestinal absorption in chil- dren, Mahaffey recommended that the tolerable level of Pb intake from all sources be less than 100 ijg Pb/day for infants between birth and six months of age and no more than 150 jxg/day for children between six months and two years. Similarly, asymptomatic exposure of children to organic Hg may result in subtle neurological deficits. For exam- ple, an epidemiological study was con- ducted of schoolchildren living in the Minamata area of Japan, who were ex- posed to fish contaminated with methyl Hg. Those suspected of prenatal and early postnatal methyl Hg exposures (age group 8 to 16 years) demonstrated a higher incidence of neurological deficits, learning difficulties, and poor perform- ance on intelligence tests than did chil- June 1981 435</page><page sequence="6">dren of similar age in an uncontaminated area (EPA 1979c). Genetics Chronic exposure to the fungicide HCB has been identified as the causative agent of the disease porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in exposed populations in Turkey. PCT is characterized by a dis- turbance in the metabolism of hepatic porphyrin; the clinical manifestations in- clude cutaneous photosensitivity and le- sions, hyperpigmentation, hypertricho- sis, hepatomegaly, and darkened urine due to the increased excretion of porphy- rin. Predisposition to HCB is genetically controlled by a dominant gene, with low penetrance in older age groups (Dogra- maci 1964). In 1954, fungicides containing 10% HCB were introduced in Turkey; the common procedure involved mixing 20 g of fungicide with 100 g of wheat seeds. However, during a period of famine, the wheat seeds themselves were used as a food source, instead of for agricultural use. Consumption of the HCB-contam- inated seeds resulted in an outbreak of PCT. In 1959, the Turkish government withdrew the fungicides from the mar- ket, and the PCT epidemic subsided (Courtney 1979). PCT occurred more frequently in chil- dren and adolescents than in adults (Schmid 1960). In a survey of 348 cases of the disease, 42% occurred in 4- to 9- year-olds, 38% in 10- to 14-years-olds, and the remainder in individuals 15 years of age and older (Cam and Nigogosyan 1963). Parents of affected children, de- spite exposure to HCB, rarely became ill. Thus, the episodes of HCB contami- nation document the hypersusceptibility of children. Nutritional Deficiencies Many children, from all socioeconom- ic levels, are nutritionally deficient in many vitamins and minerals (Owen and Lippman 1977) and, as a result, are more sensitive to environmental contaminants (Calabrese 1980). For instance, 65% of American children between the ages of two and three years receive less than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of calcium (Ca) (Calabrese 1978, 1980). Such Ca-deficient children may be more sensitive to heavy metals, as increased gastrointestinal absorption of Pb (Mahaf- fey 1974, Mahaffey-Six and Goyer 1970) and Cd (Larsson and Piscator 1971) was noted in animals fed a Ca-deficient diet. Moreover, approximately 98% of chil- dren in the same age bracket receive less than the RDA of Fe (Calabrese 1978, 1980), and animal studies demonstrate that an Fe-deficient diet potentiates the gastrointestinal absorption of Cd (Flana- gan et al. 1978) and Pb (Mahaffey-Six and Goyer 1972). The increased Pb bur- den in children of a rural Louisiana com- munity was attributed, in part, to the low dietary intake of Fe and Ca (Levander 1977). A diet deficient in Zn potentiates the toxicity of Cd. For example, oral expo- sure of rats to drinking water amended with 17.2 mg Cd per liter evoked testicu- lar and pulmonary lesions when the ani- mals were on a marginal Zn intake of 5 mg/kg feed, but not when the diet con- tained 40 mg Zn/kg feed (Lal 1976). In- fants and children under four years of age may be at risk from suboptimal lev- els of Zn: Analyses of the Zn content in the hair of 338 individuals in Colorado showed mean levels of 174 ppm Zn for neonates, 88 ppm Zn for three-month- olds to four-year-olds, 153 ppm Zn for 4- to 17-year-olds, and 180 ppm Zn for 17- to 40-year-olds (Hambridge et al. 1972). Thus, suboptimal levels of Zn in toddlers may cause them to be hypersusceptible to Cd. Individuals deficient in vitamin C may be more susceptible to heavy metals and NO2-. Vitamin C prevented Cd-induced anemia and growth retardation in quail (Fox and Fry 1970) and Hg toxicity in guinea pigs (Vauthey 1951), and has been clinically used to reduce the occurrence and severity of methemoglobinemia in human infants. Since 10 to 30% of infants and children of low-income groups re- ceive less than the RDA of vitamin C, they may be hypersusceptible to heavy metals and NO2-. Pesticides such as DDT and dieldrin, as well as PCB, exac- erbate vitamin A deficiency in rats by reducing storage of this vitamin in the liver. The RDA for vitamin A is not met by about 25% of children between the ages of 7 and 12 years; this deficiency may be potentiated by the ingestion of pesticide- or PCB-contaminated foods (Calabrese 1978, 1980). PROGNOSIS The failure to consider differential sen- sitivities to environmental contaminants in foods reflects different problems. First, the statutory mandates of FDA and EPA differ as to the types of infor- mation that they routinely receive and on which they can base environmental stan- dards. Through the regulations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Ro- denticide Act, EPA requires substantial toxicological data on acute, subacute, and chronic health effects, as well as projected exposure data. FDA has no authority to require such uniform, tech- nical information and tends to rely on the best available information submitted by industry, government, and university laboratories plus those data published in the scientific literature. Secondly, there is a paucity of scientific data on the differential sensitivity of the young, save for some research on heavy metals and certain selected pesticides, such as HCB. These two factors, in turn, have produced a situation where little precedent exists for establishing toler- ance levels for infants and toddlers which acknowledge their heightened sus- ceptibility to contaminants. Of the variety of contaminants in food, it is only for Pb that the federal agencies have set standards specifically recogniz- ing the hypersensitivity of young chil- dren. Lead is the only toxicant for which studies with immature laboratory ani- mals and clinical observations of chil- dren indicate the hypersensitivity of the young. For many other toxicants, such studies are not available. This may ex- plain the lack of standards to protect the young from contaminants in food. Thus, the need for toxicological data on immature animal models is acute. The federal agencies must seek the authority to require manufacturers of pesticides and other potential toxicants to submit toxicological laboratory animal data on the relative sensitivities of young and adult animals in order to provide better protection for all age groups. The as- sumption that arbitrary safety factors of from 2 to 2000 necessarily protect the young does not rest on solid technical data. In light of experimental animal studies detailing hypersusceptibility of young animals, as well as some epidemi- ological studies with similar findings, data on the young should be routinely gathered. The development of tolerances and action levels truly protective of chil- dren require such data. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported, in part, by a development grant from the Andrew W.
