This book describes the life story of a Laysan Albatross, beginning with the mating of the parents and continuing until after the adult or breeding phase of life is well underway.</page><page sequence="2">Vo. 83, NO. 2 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 211 The book is written for "naval personnel, their friends and mainlanders who have not seen the birds" (p. vii). It is thus not necessarily intended as "a must for all ornitholo- gists" as the dust cover states. The book probably accomplishes the author's objectives to a reasonable degree. The non- ornithologist reader will find Mrs. Fisher's poetic writing of daily episodes in the life of an albatross pleasing and entertaining. "Our" albatross, of course, survives all adventures. The reader will gather much lore about albatrosses. Although the book presents many results of the scientific work of the author and her husband, Dr. Harvey I. Fisher, it should be used with caution as a reference because of the lack of documentation. The author notes her awareness of anthropomorphism in the Foreword. From among the many anthropomorphic and teleological expressions I will quote a few that may cause ethologists and ornithologists to squirm. Of birds whose mates failed to return. Mrs. Fisher writes (p. 12) ". . . the bereaved birds moved back to the sea . . ."; of the female with her new egg (p. 14) : ". . . she rose to show her egg to those who neared her"; of an encounter between two incubating birds (p. 27): "The victorious bird . . . was exhilarated from the battle . . ."; of the mother's feeling for her young, that she (p. 32): "was intent only on keeping the new baby warm . . ."; that a nesting albatross had a special feeling for the human child (p. 40): "No albatross pecked at or cut a child with its sharp-edged bill"; that the education of a young albatross (p. 44): ". . . depended upon aping his elders . . ."; and further (p. 63): ". . . he gazed skyward for hours at a time at the stars . . . fixing forever in his mind his position in . . . the North Pacific Ocean.... His learning took time.... Nature demanded that he ... spend at least five months on the land...." Some statements are misleading. For example, I discovered that the eyes of the Laysan Albatross are (p. 12): ". . . protected by long black and white eyelashes . . ." structures that, as far as I know, have not been observed before. Further, the author says of the incubation or brood patch (p. 14) : ". . . the egg slid out of her pouch"; here the "pouch" sounds like a kangaroo pouch. Of nest building (p. 19): "He dragged in mouthful after mouthful of sand . . .", whereas sand is raked in by the bill tip, not by "mouthfuls." Of the female's first period at sea after laying, she returned (p. 25) : ". . . at the end of her allotted twenty-four days." This sounds like a fixed period but in observing 110 nesting pairs we found that this period ranged from 1.5 to 32.0 days (Rice and Kenyon, Auk, 79: 543, 1962). It is a little difficult to accept that an albatross avoided being captured by a shark because he was (p. 29) : "Warned by a shock wave that a tremendous fish was approaching...." Although marine mammals are not the subject of this book, it seems unfortunate that when they are mentioned the information is not always correct. It is said of the Hawaiian monk seal (p. 129) : ". . . the mother seal was molting; her fur was falling out in great patches." Many observations indicate that the monk seal mother does not molt until after her pup is weaned. Dr. Fisher's 67 photographs, which were chosen to illustrate specific stages of albatross development and characteristic attitudes, accomplish their objective ably. They are not listed in the contents and the book is not indexed. My general reaction to this book is that it may safely be read by those who "like birds," want to be entertained, and will be cautious about what they accept as fact. I feel, though, that to captivate readers by ascribing human characteristics to birds may cause sentimental complications that are not necessarily advantageous either to birds or to people.-KARL W.
