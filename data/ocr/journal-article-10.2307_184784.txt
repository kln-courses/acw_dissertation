FRANK I 1 7/ ODAY we are in the midst of a far-reaching , slq shift in scientific thought involving the re- i ;^ ; casting of many of our long-cherished ideas 0^ ^^ and preconceptions. To some this appears but j(. 'q~u,3 the orderly evolution of scientific thought, ^ !~_ while to others it portends a revolution in both the ideas and the methods of scientific inquiry.1 It is clear from the history of science that a major change in ideas and conceptions usually disposes of a large number of problems and perplexities, not by furnishing any immediate and clear-cut solutions, but by revealing the irrelevance of the ques- tions. That is to say, a new framework of ideas and conceptions, by superseding an older framework in terms of which the current scientific problems have been expressed, renders those problems obsolete and by so much contributes to their rapid dismissal from contemporary thinking. This process has been described in the statement that most of the problems which have occupied 1 Cf. A. N. Whitehead, "Science and the Modern World;" G. N. Lewis, "Anatomy of Science;" P. W.

However difficult, they cannot be evaded nor can they long be postponed.3 Especially in the field of biology and psychology there is need for more discussion of the changes impending in scientific work, as indicated by the conceptions and related ideas of emergence ("holism"), the "organismic" conception, and the introduction of the idea of relativity into biological thinking. The present situation has recently been described by F. S. C. Northrop in the following statement: "Living organisms exhibit among other properties an atomic or physico-chemical constitution, and form or structure. These two fac- tors appear in our title as entities and organization. Historically sci- ence has never succeeded in finding a theory of first principles which will do justice to both of these attributes. Always it has had to choose between two theories which provided meaning for one at the expense of the other. This is the crux of the issue between mechanism and tele- ology and between atomism and organicism. In history it appears in the conflict between the Aristotelian and the modern conception of sci- ence. Aristotle, approaching living creatures through description and classification by way of natural history was impressed by their form and organization, and hence introduced formal as well as material causes. The result, as he saw, and accepted in his metaphysics, was the rejection of physical atomic categories. Matter became, along with form, the mere attribute of a dynamic teleological activity. Modern science, on the other hand, approaching the living creature through the experimental investigations of Harvey, Lavoisier, Liebig, W6hler, and others found 2 "The history of science is a record, not so much of the progressive discovery of truth, but of our gradual emancipation from error."

Bridgman.</page><page sequence="3">2 12 Structure, Function and Growth it necessary to accept the physico-chemical theory of both living and non-living systems. The result, as Claude Bernard saw and as J. S Haldane has emphasized more recently, is the failure to account for organization. Ancient biology provided for form with a resultant rigid fixity of types at the expense of entities and the fluidity of species; modern biological theory provides for the non-fixity of types and the presence of physico-chemical and genetical entities at the expense of organization."4 The growing realization of the significance of time for biological studies and the consideration of the problem of growth are further evidence of what is about to take place in biological thinking. II If we reflect upon the conception of a space-time manifold, we are immediately faced with certain implications that may be briefly stated as follows: Every existent (such as an organism) may be approached as a space-time configuration, subject, within the limits of instrumentation, to measurement. While we may employ the measures of extension and mass to ascertain the spatial dimensions of an existent and the measures of time sequence and of duration to ascertain the temporal dimensions of an existent, a rigorous application of the conception of space- time will preclude any separation of the spatial from the temporal dimensions. Dr. Carrel has expressed this conception in a recent paper as follows: "During development, an animal extends simultaneously in time and in space. Temporal extension is absolutely indispensable to spatial extension. Growth is unthinkable except along one temporal and three spatial axes. In this manner, time is given a spatial representation and considered as a fourth dimension. But such a convenient assumption is probably not accurate. In fact, each spatial dimension also contains temporal elements. At every point of the living things created in space 4 "Entities and Organization in Current Biological Theory," by F. S. C. Northrop. Sigma Xi Quarterly, Vol. XXI, No. i, March 1933.</page><page sequence="4">L. K. Frank 213 by time, space and time are indissolubly united. Biologists should have conceived long before Einstein and Minkowsky that space and time are not separate entities but constituent elements of a four-dimensional continuum."5 Concretely, the foregoing means that the problem of structure, organization, or form is the problem of spatial configuration or sequence, while the problem of function, process, or activity is the problem of temporal duration or sequence. Structure and function, however, are not separate factors or entities, but two different aspects of, or observations upon, a space-time con- figuration or organism. There can be no rigid dichotomy of structure and function, of organization and process, of form and activity, because a structure is a persistentfunction, while afunction is a series of changing structures.6 A function or process is a series of changing spatial configura- tions, each one of which is an event in the temporal series we call functioning. As we are learning to use instruments for temporal magnification, e.g., the "slow motion picture" and the strobo- scope, we are discovering that a function or process occurs through, or as, a series of structural deformations or spatial alterations: We see a succession of spatial configurations, each merging into the next, as the structure is deformed; these de- formations or spatial alterations are the function. "Tissue and blood cells are always in process of becoming. They do not show their true physiognomy when they are examined under the micro- scope. Cinematography alone is capable of recording their fourth dimension. Fixed cells appear on the film as mobile as flame. Their surface is never smooth. In some places it bubbles like boiling water."7 We may measure these structural altera- tions spatially and measure the functional activity temporally 6 "Physiological Time," by Dr. Alexis Carrel.

One can not consider them separately. Each structural detail possesses its functional expression. It is through the physiological aptitudes of their anatomical parts that the life of the higher animals is rendered possible. Likewise, the life of a community of ants depends on the physiological aptitudes of the individuals of which it is composed. When cells are considered only as structural elements, they are deprived of all the properties that make them capable of organizing as a living whole. Within the organism, they are associated according to certain laws. Cell sociology results from properties specific to each cell type. Among these properties, some manifest themselves under ordinary con- ditions of life, while others remain hidden. Tissues are endowed with potentialities far greater than those which are apparent. But these potentialities become actualized only when certain modifications of the internal environment occur, as, for instance, when pathogenic agencies are at work within the body. The significance of a given structural state is bound to the knowledge of the corresponding physiological state. Structure and function must be considered simultaneously."8 A recent paper by G. E. Coghill discusses this conception: "According to current thought, nothing is static; everything exists not only in a 'frame' of space but also in a pattern of time. It becomes, then, a question not of matter and motion, but of matter in motion. Neither is it a question of structure and function; but it is a condition of structure in function; for all structure is in action, and the action of a structure is its function. Argument as to whether structure precedes function or function precedes structure, or in other terms, whether struc- ture causes function or function causes structure is beside the mark, for neither can exist without the other at any point in space or time: they merge, in fact, into a space-time relation. Accordingly, if we think structure as static, we can attain in science only description that is infil- trated with metaphysics in the form of an anthropomorphic and mystical conception of cause and effect; but if we think structure in function as a space-time relation, as we must in a purely scientific discipline, we may 8 "The New Cytology," by Dr. Alexis Carrel.

Frank 215 hope to attain to all the understanding of behavior that science has to offer."9 Concomitantly with the spatial alterations of an organism, energy transformations occur and are.exhibited as light, heat, chemical and electrical activity, and changing mass. These data are also used to study function and process, but since they are so dissimilar to the structures releasing them, students of functional activity have usually ignored the spatial alterations or deforma- tions that give rise to these energy transformations. It is evi- dent, however, that the sequence of changing spatial configura- tions, the time sequence or duration, and the energy emitted or absorbed, are but three different ways in which the space-time configuration or organism is revealed. An organism exists as a space-time configuration which functions as a series of spatial deformations occurring in sequence for a period of time, accom- panied by energy transformations. These alterations in the space-time configuration are the energy transformations which are propagated and recorded in various ways. It is evident that spatial measurements of structure must be made at some stage of functional activity, that is, at some phase of the spatial deformations which the organism undergoes as it functions. There are several possible choices of such time: at the moment of minimal spatial deformation or functional activity (at rest); at the upper and lower limits of spatial de- formation from which an average may be calculated; or after death, when functional activity has ceased and further alteration (through fixatives) has been arrested. From these practices it would appear that we apply the term structure or organization to one of the many spatial configurations exhibited by the functioning organism. This means that we arbitrarily select the set of spatial dimensions for which the term structure is used and that, strictly speaking, there is no structure to an organism, in the older sense of a definite, static, spatial arrangement with precise dimensions, as Coghill has emphasized (supra). Rather 9 "The Neuro-Embryologic Study of Behavior: Principles, Perspective and Aim," by Professor G. E. Coghill. Science, Vol. 78, No. 2016, August 18, 933, p. I37.</page><page sequence="7">216 Structure, Function and Growth we have spatial configurations which recur or persist most fre- quently and those are the structure which exists through con- tinuous functioning. Thus a function is to be regarded as the sequence of structural alterations that occur in and with energy transformations for definite periods of time. Organic configurations or structures cannot exist without functioning, i.e., undergoing transformations, nor can functions occur without alterations in the spatial configurations through which these transformations take place. Dr. Carrel may again be quoted for his cogent expression of this point: "The living organism undergoes two classes of changes: rhythmical and reversible, or progressive and irreversible. These changes are as indispensable a part of the body as the tissues and organs described by the anatomists. Anatomy, to use a definition of Woodger, studies the organism in timeless space. Such a study is imposed by methodological necessity. Its object is not the concrete body, but only an artefact. An organism deprived of duration is just as unthinkable as if deprived of spatial extension. Dead organs and histological sections are nothing but useful abstractions. The body really consists of a flux of structural and functional processes, that is, of an uninterrupted modification of tissues, humors and consciousness. Such is physiological duration."'0 It appears then that structures may be relatively stable with small energy transformations and spatial alterations, or highly unstable so that the spatial dimensions are subject to rapidly alternating deformations with a high rate of energy transforma- tions as shown by absorption and emission of energy. This contrast is to be seen in bony structures of fairly stable configura- tion and limited energy transformations and in muscular or glandular structures with rapidly shifting spatial configurations and large energy transformations. Even more pronounced is the contrast with liquid or colloidal structures (gels and sals), where the spatial configurations alter with extraordinary rapidity and enormously powerful energy transformations. (Cf. later discussion of fields and quotation from Jerome Alexander, p. 232). 10 "Physiological Time," by Dr. Alexis Carrel.

Frank 217 If the structures of an organism are classified into a hierarchy, according to the instability of their spatial dimensions, they will be found to be arranged in order of magnitude of energy trans- formations and functional activity because of this relationship. Furthermore, the greater the functional activity per unit of time, the shorter will be the duration of the spatial configuration or structure from which the energy transformation arises, since, as just indicated, the persistence of a spatial configuration pre- cludes intense functional activity or energy transformations; again, the contrast between slowly changing mineralized structure of a bone and the short-lived blood-forming cells within the bone. The functional activity of a structure involves energy trans- formations, in the form of absorption and emission of energy (as heat, et cetera) thereby determining the character (i.e., degree of structural elasticity) of the immediately adjacent structures through which those energy transformations may be propagated: the more labile the structure, the more intense is its functional activity and the greater its concomitant energy transformation, and the greater the necessity for contact with a structure of even greater lability and functional activity. Thus we see how solid, liquid and gaseous structures relate themselves in an organism to provide for the interchange or transmission of energy between the organism and its several component spatial configurations and the surrounding medium, liquid or gas.l The theoretical basis for this situation is indicated in a state- ment by Joel H. Hildebrand: "I shall now attempt to lay a basis for understanding such a phenome- non. The physical differences between solids, liquids and gases are familiar to all. The kinetic picture of these differences can be stated in very elementary terms. In the solid, the molecules are held in a rigid lattice, each oscillating about its mean position. As the temperature rises, this oscillation increases until, at the melting point, the molecules no longer return to their former domains and the lattice breaks down. From this point on the molecular motion is no longer chiefly oscillatory 11 See J. Needham, "Protein Metabolism and Organic Evolution," Science Progress, April I929, for an excellent illustration of this point.</page><page sequence="9">2I8 Structure, Function and Growth in character, but the molecules are free to wander about the liquid, confined within the surface by the inter-molecular attractions which are so strong that only an occasional molecule is bumped so hard by its neighbors as to be able to escape into the vapor state, where it moves between collisions with other molecules in rectilinear paths, which may be hundreds or even thousands of times greater than its own diameter. I will show this molecular agitation in the liquid state by a motion pic- ture of the Brownian movement. It is evident that the solid state, in which the molecules are oscillating about fixed positions, and the dilute gas, in which they are moving most of the time in straight lines, present simpler theoretical pictures than the liquid state, in which their motions are far more irregular. It is not strange, therefore, that our knowledge of this state has lagged so far behind that of the other two."12 It becomes evident then that the growth of specific structural components and their organization into functioning configura- tions proceed from the space-time sequences and energy trans- formations involved, thus giving a clue to what underlies Child's conception of the physiological gradient: the proliferation of any structure involves not only spatial configurations but energy transformation of graduated nature which set up space-time sequences, both before and after the proliferation; at the growing end the spatial configuration will be most labile, therefore most active in energy interchange; immediately surrounding it must be a more labile medium for that energy interchange while a less labile structure will arise behind them to give support. The regeneration of nerve tissue, as Detwiler and others have shown, takes place by growth toward the point of future reunion; this is further evidence for the view that functional activity may be defined as structural deformations, in this case taking place in a medium that makes possible a permanent alteration of the spatial configuration and restoration of the previous dimensions. Thus it will be seen how this conception of space-time sequences, instead of the older concepts of discrete structure and function, enables us to approach some of the more puzzling features of biological problems. By recognizing that growth is not merely 12 "The Liquid State," by Professor Joel H. Hildebrand. Science, Vol. 80, No. 2067, August Io, I934, p. 126.</page><page sequence="10">L. K. Frank 219 structural change, but is a series of structural-functional altera- tions, or more precisely, a sequence of deformations of a space- time configuration that cumulate or persist until the original dimensions are shifted, we may escape the difficulty of our pre- vious formulations and advance our problem. The problem of organic growth or development may be stated as the measurement of the changing dimensions of structure- function activity of the organism, and the discovery of the sequence in which those changes occur. The study of organic development involves therefore the simultaneous measurement of the organisms' structures, functions, and activities, using all available scientific techniques and instruments for the purpose and collecting these data from individual organisms over a period of time sufficient to reveal the developmental process of the individual organism. This is a relatively novel problem to those who have been trained exclusively in the analytic proce- dures of studying the relation between two variables as revealed in data collected from a large number of subjects at a given in- stant of time. The attempts to synthesize growth curves by adding statistical data from organisms of successive age groups have not been successful, as the New Orleans symposium on development indicates: "In the realm of physical anthropology emphasis centered very largely around the question of growth. Papers and discussions. . . were fo- cussed to an unprecedented degree on the individual, as contrasted with the group. Indeed, the sessions devoted to this subject left a rather definite impression that we may be at the beginning of a new era, in which individual, rather than mass studies, will beforemost. The impor- tance of observing the same individual over the largest possible period was emphasized by nearly every speaker who dealt with any aspect of development."'3 Embryology and child development research necessitate the consecutive or longitudinal study of organic growth in a single organism so that these simultaneous alterations in spatial and 13 Report of A.A.A.S. meeting, New Orleans, December I931, Section H.

Growth may be regarded as the changes in magnitude, while development is the patterning of those changes and their interrelationships within the changing organic configuration. It begins to appear, then, that a spatial configuration may be deformed and then return to its previous dimensions as in ordi- nary functioning; if, however, after such a functional deformation it does not return to its former dimensions, it will begin to enlarge or diminish, with a concomitant alteration in functional activity, as we see in the growth and differentiation of an organism. This conception of growth as a functional process which involves persistent structural changes becomes clear in the light of the preceding discussion of the nature of function and structure as two measurements of the same space-time configuration. This point of view likewise suggests an altered conception of pathological change, viewed as the end condition of an organism (or its component) where a structure is first deformed beyond its usual limits as it functions under adverse or novel conditions; with each repetition of such extraordinary functioning the limits of so-called normal deformation (functioning) are changed or shifted until the configuration becomes persistently altered to function in the new manner. Dr. John J. Abel has said: "Disease in its reversible early stages can not be more clearly defined until we are better informed in respect to the many chemical and physi- cal processes and the composition and function of the many microphysi- cal structures that are concerned with the maintenance of the ever- varying 'normal state' of cells or cell states."'4 Correction of the adverse conditions may lead to a return to normal or substitute structure-function,15 provided the adjacent 14 "On Poisons and Disease and Some Experiments with the Toxin of the Bacillus Tetani," by Dr. John J.

Frank 221 structures and surrounding media will again permit the shift to the old limits of structural deformation. The traditional con- troversy over "organic" versus "functional" may be resolved by viewing the pathological or disease situation as arising from two different processes: where the abnormal functional activity takes place without persistent structural deformations (pathological changes) we have the so-called functional disease that does not reveal itself in the usual histological picture as it does when the abnormal functioning involves permanent structural changes in the organic configuration. This difference points to the prob- ability of individual variations in the elasticity of structural alterations whereby unusual or abnormal functioning (structural deformations with energy transformation) can occur in some organisms and at some times without involving persistent struc- tural changes. III This leads us to the examination of another conception, which we may, borrowing from physics, term the "field," meaning thereby that every space-time configuration, by reason of the spatial deformations and the energy transformations it under- goes, has a definite range of interaction with other space-time configurations. To illustrate, the deformation of, and the heat emitted by, a muscle segment will extend and the heat will be absorbed within certain limits; every configuration within these limits may be considered as lying within the "field" of that muscle segment. This appears in Child's minimal distance of separation for gradients. Obviously, in many organisms the "fields" of interaction have been enormously extended through such means of diffusion or conduction as the nerves, the blood, and the lymph, the latter carrying nutritive substances which act as special "fields" for structural change. "This has led to the discovery of strains of fibroblasts, which, although morpho- logically identical, differ in their nutritional properties. The food requirements of a given cell type are as fundamental a characteristic as its morphological aspect. It appears that each cell type demands a specific diet."16 16 "The New Cytology," by Dr. Alexis Carrel; supra.</page><page sequence="13">222 Structure, Function and Growth Whenever a space-time configuration enters the "field" of another space-time configuration, the previous limits of deforma- tion, energy transformations, and of duration of both configura- tions are altered so that the structures and functions of both configurations are changed while such contact persists. More- over, whenever a space-time configuration is brought permanently into the "field" of another space-time configuration, these altera- tions will become persistent in the sense that the contiguous "fields" of both will interact, thereby giving rise to another space- time configuration, which will not be the exact sum of the two formerly separate configurations, but rather a different configura- tion embracing some of the structural and functional character- istics of both. This statement offers another way of approaching the subject of "emergents" and a method of introducing the general idea of relativity into biological thinking, as the later discussion of time will further explain. Obviously the dimen- sions of a space-time configuration (e.g., the structure and func- tions of a molecule or cell) will be governed by the "fields" in which it appears, so that the same kind of molecule or cell will have a different structure-function for each "field" or larger configuration of "fields" in which it is comprehended. When we study the molecule in isolation from diverse "fields" or remove the cell from its organic "fields," as in dissection or other analytic procedures, it exhibits only those structure-function aspects which arise from their basic chemical characteristics or the artificial "fields" in which they are studied and fail to reveal their organic characteristics. Moreover, the aggregate "fields" of an organism operate to conserve its organic unity and stability, since all energy transformations within the organism are im- mediately transmitted to and received by the other "fields."17 17 "L. J. Henderson, Interpreting Willard Gibbs' Phase-Rule, describes similar charac- teristics of reality when he writes: 'I. Other things being equal, the stability of a system increases with the number of phases, and also with the number of restrictions upon the intensities of energy, e.g., temperature, and upon the concentrations. Thus a system of three phases is more stable than a similar system of two phases; a system of constant tem- perature is more stable than a similar system in which the temperature is variable; and a system in which the tension of carbon dioxide is constant is more stable than one in which this is a variable quantity. II. Other things being equal, the stability of a system</page><page sequence="14">L. K. Frank 223 What we mean by an organism, or organization, is essentially an aggregate of space-time configurations, the "fields" of which interact directly or through media of conduction, such as nervous or vascular tissue. This conception of organization has a wide application, since under it we may subsume the purely inorganic and organic organizations and also the social organizations wherein each participating organism has its behavior patterned by the behavior or "fields" of the other participating organisms. By such an approach to the question of organization as the aggregate of interacting "fields" (interacting activities of the participating entities), we may dispense with the rather mystical notions of organization and organizers so frequently invoked, especially by biologists and social scientists.18 We may also eliminate the notion of the "whole" dominating the parts since the interacting "fields" of the constituent parts are the whole. Organization and past experience are to be viewed as the pattern- ing of functions or behavior, modifications in the structure- functions of the participating entities that have persisted.19 Accepting the implications of the foregoing would eliminate the simple notion of conduction of impulses, as often viewed in nervous tissue, in favor of the notion of space-time alterations of the whole configuration, thus bringing the problem of nervous impulse in line with the problem of light transmission and other energy transformations, wherein a wave of energy transforma- tions passes along or through a sequence of space-time con- figurations with interacting "fields;" as each point-event in that diminishes with increase of the number of its undecomposed constituent molecular species, and the number of different forms of energy, e.g., heat, pressure, electrical potential, surface-tension, which are involved in its activities.

Rather a change of state is initiated at one end of the sequence and is propagated through the interacting "fields," each of which exhibits a space-time alteration and energy trans- formation in accordance with the pattern of its structure-function. A crude illustration of the conception is to be seen in a string of beads which are of different sizes, a row of small beads, then a row of large beads, then smaller and larger. If the beads at one end receive an impulse it will spread along the whole string and, as it passes, the activity of each segment will be character- istic to the size of the beads. Nothing is moved or transported from one end of the string to the other, but there is a sequence of space-time alterations as each bead (point-event) receives the impulse of its neighbor and in turn sets the next adjacent bead in motion. One segment with small beads will exhibit small spatial deformations, but rapid transmission from bead to bead, while another segment with large beads will exhibit larger spatial deformations and slower transmission. Accompanying these spatial deformations (changes of state) energy transformations occur, as measured in heat, chemical and electrical activity. These energy transformations are the "fields," through which the sequence of configurations interact. When the "fields" of dissimilar configurations are interacting, energy transformations peculiar to that situation occur, as for example, the production of acetylcholine (Dale) and sympathin (Cannon), where nerve and muscle meet.20 "A nerve fiber is surrounded by a plasma membrane which, when in the resting state, is polarized with an excess of positive ions on the out- side and of negative ones on the inside. The nerve impulse renders the membrane temporarily permeable and depolarized. Positive ions in front of this permeable portion of the membrane stream backward 20 See Henry Dale, "Chemical Ideas in Medicine and Biology," Science, October I9, 1934, Vol. 80, No. 2077.

Frank 225 through it and then forward to neutralize the negative ions on the inner side. This adjacent part of the membrane thus becomes depolarized, and, according to the theory, depolarization for some reason makes it permeable, and the positive ions beyond it can stream backward through it to depolarize in turn the next stretch of the fiber. In this way a wave of electrical and chemical change spreads along the fiber. This is the nerve impulse."21 This conception is of the greatest significance for the problems of biology, neurology, and psychology, where we are wrestling with such questions as the transmission of nervous impulses and similar problems of conduction. According to the conception here set forth, the stimulus at one end, e.g., light impinging upon a sense organ of vision, initiates a series of energy transformations which proceed as a wave transmitted along the sequence of space-time configurations of the organism. In nervous tissue there is rapid transmission, small deformation, and little energy transformation (so we say nervous tissue merely conducts), but as the wave of energy transformations reaches a muscle spindle or aggregate of muscle spindles, energy transformations occur at the point of juncture and are then propagated with relatively enormous deformations, slower transmission and large energy transformations. Two interesting consequences follow from the above. First, we may eliminate the dichotomy of nervous tissue-muscle spindle and the resulting problem of how one causes the other to contract, for we see the nerve-muscle sequence as one configura- tion with characteristically different deformations and energy transformations through which we may observe the passage of a wave of changes of state. Our difficulty arises from splitting an essentially unified configuration into two parts and thereby artificially creating a problem of how to get them together again.22 21 "Cutaneous Sensation," by Professor S.

Glands function and secrete, muscles function and contract, nerves function and conduct, and so on, each with its appropriate spatial deformations and energy trans- formation of heat, chemical and electrical reactions, and the like, as an impulse arising in one segment is transmitted through channels of conduction, or, more precisely, through interacting "fields," in each of which appears the structural deformations appropriate to the magnitude and pattern of its structure-func- tion. A relatively small deformation in a sense organ is pro- pagated through a nerve with great rapidity and small deforma- tion to a muscle or gland where the deformation is large and the accompanying energy transformations are considerable. "It would thus appear that in the case of living organisms, special structural substances are required for each single form and function, in contrast to artificial machines, which, serving the most diverse pur- poses, may be constructed from a limited number of materials."23 This difference between machines and organisms was described from another angle by Sigaud, the French physician, who pointed out that a machine continues to operate only so long as its di- mensions remain the same (i.e., its structure is unaltered), while an organism can function only by undergoing continual alteration of structure (i.e., by deformations and replacements). The second consequence of this view is that the transmission of the wave of deformations and their accompanying energy transformations are conditioned by the readiness of every portion of the sequence involved to be deformed. That is to say, the muscle fibers must be in a state of readiness to be activated, with an adequate supply of energy to be transformed, or the total reaction will not occur or will occur in lessened magnitude.

Frank 227 implies that the irritability of the eye to light is conditioned by the readiness of the muscles to react or, in other words, that the responding organs evoke the stimulus by their readiness to react, which, in the sense organ end of the configuration, appears as a condition of heightened irritability. Thus, readiness to respond generates and patterns the stimulus as much as the stimulus evokes the response.24 What we call instinct, then, is not a preformed reflex arc specific to a particular function nor a highly differentiated neuromuscular pattern reserved solely for in- stinctive behavior, but rather a condition of heightened irrita- bility and readiness to respond, generated at specific times and places by the growing organism and touched off by the appro- priate situation-event.25 The various organ systems and seg- ments of an organism, being within the "fields" of each other are thereby maintained in a state of readiness to react (i.e., change structure and thereby function) in response to activities of other segments. Thus, the stimulus to function is in a real sense created by the responding organism as we see in sexual maturation that sensitizes the organism to the potential mate. Since this newer formulation serves to restate our problems in a more serviceable fashion, it is urged here as a desirable way of reconsidering the situation. Succinctly, it means that if the muscle or gland were not prepared to respond, the eye would not see the stimulus. Stated positively, this means that the eye sees only what the organism is prepared to respond to, which is another way of stating the basic principles of the Gestalt School in Germany, with its emphasis upon the selective, patterned perception of the organism.26 An even more telling example of this principle is seen in the Rorschach test where the individual sees in the "ink blots" what his organic experience has specifically compelled him to see. 24 Cf.

S. Lashley has stressed this point in discussing cerebral functions: "There is evidence that the activity of every nervous center is con- ditioned by a variety of factors. Its general level of excitability varies and a low threshold or state of tonic activity is maintained by excitation from many sources. Steadiness and continuity of discharge are likewise maintained by agencies other than those which are concerned in the specific patterning of reactions. In addition, there are many indications of a preliminary integration or setting of nervous mechanisms which may then maintain a potential organization until activated by excitation from other sources. Thus it is possible, by brief stimulation of a motor point in the cortex, to modify the motor responses elicited on stimulation of distant points and such an altered excitability or motor set may per- sist for an hour or more before it gives way to the original pattern of response. "These processes, which we may term priming, steadying and prepara- tory adjustment, seem to be subthreshold for overt activity: some sort of partial activation or tonic excitation of centers. In addition to these, there are activating mechanisms which perhaps impose additional pat- terns of integration or perhaps only raise the tonic excitation above the threshold for motor expression. "In the motor field we have evidence that many structures participate in activity without actually determining the specific pattern of skilled movement."27 IV Anyone who will pursue the implications of this view into biology, medicine, psychology, and the social sciences, will begin to see what a revolution impends in our thinking as these newer conceptions are brought into those fields. Older formulations and problems and the scientific work to which they give rise, are rendered obsolescent as we catch a glimpse of the new problems generated by these altered approaches. The problem of evolutionary development and of learning receive a new significance when we employ the conception of "fields." In so far as we envisage the interaction of space-time 27 "Mass Action in Cerebral Function," by Professor K. S. Lashley.

Frank 229 configurations (organisms) and the "fields" of the environing situation, we may contemplate the "emergence" of new structure- functions. The organic configuration will undergo permanent alteration through the impact of new "fields," arising from large- scale climatic and geological changes, or shifts to a different medium, as for example, in the change from a marine to a littoral environment involving contact with the "fields" of the atmos- phere in addition to the "fields" of the water.28 We thus may envisage a hierarchy of space-time configurations with an in- creasing irritability or susceptibility to the "fields" of other space-time configurations. Physics is concerned with the inter- action of like "fields," chemistry with the elementary complex of diverse "fields," while biology (including psychology and the social sciences) studies the interaction of diverse "fields" within and without the organism, including learned behavior and cul- ture. The more complex an organism, the more "fields" of dif- ferent kinds it comprehends within the space-time configuration we call its structure and function, and likewise the greater the variety of external "fields," e.g., stimuli, to which it can respond. It is evident that the conception of cause and effect, which physics has already relinquished for the most part, must also be eliminated in the biological sciences. Instead of seeking so- called causes in organic life and behavior, we must learn to think of events taking place within an organic configuration with a past history so that organic development and functioning, break- downs, etc., are to be viewed as different ways in which the organic configuration reveals its make-up, the on-going energy transformations, and the realization of its unique life career. Thus, biological thinking may begin to assimilate the more recent transformations in thought initiated in physics and astron- omy and certain to influence our whole climate of opinion. The so-called "cause" may be defined as "any event which delivers energy to another event, in distinction from a limita- 28 Cf. the discussions by F. H.

But this "effect" is not the product of the "cause"; it is the alteration in structure-function of the organism touched off by the energy of that "cause." To understand the "effect" we must study not merely the antecedent "cause" or energy impact, but the organ- ism, its structures-functions, prior history and present state. In such experiments as artificial fertilization, X-ray treatments, and in conditioned reflexes (Pavlov), we are beginning to see how to evoke given "effects" by use of equivalent forms of energy and the conditioning of the organism to respond to surrogates for the original stimulus. It is evident that the stimulus (original or surrogate) touches off a response, the nature and extent of which is a function not so much of the stimulus, as of the prior history and present state of the organism. Thus it is becoming evident that the same stimulus or event will elicit different responses according to the condition or state of the responding organism and the structure-function of the specific organs upon which the stimulus-substance impinges. Accordingly, many of the diverse properties of endocrine secretions may be indicative of varied responses of different structure-functions to the same secretion that thereby appears to have different properties because of the diverse organs or structures it stimulates (cf. the pituitary). One further consequence of these views is that any given or- ganism (space-time configuration) may yield a large number of data which record or measure the spatial and temporal dimen- sions and the energy transformations accompanying the changes in structure-function. Therefore, to take a set of spatially- measured data and a set of temporally-measured data or data of energy transformations from the same set of organisms and then attempt to demonstrate that one is the "cause" or the "invariable antecedent" or the "determinant," et cetera, of the 29 Chappell, M.

Nevertheless, it is suggested that a large part of contemporary scientific work, particularly in biology, psychology, and the social sciences, con- sists in just this artificial dichotomization of two or more sets of data derived from the same organisms, with a triumphant putting them back together again with the aid of more or less elaborate statistical techniques, a method already described by E. A. Bott as the "split-field" method. The contrast to this analytic pro- cedure has been cogently expressed by Dr. Alexis Carrel: "The success of the new method in bringing about the discovery of so many phenomena must be attributed to its power, which histology, physics and chemistry lack, to apprehend the complex system formed by the tissues and their environment. The concepts and methods of physics and chemistry are adapted to the atomic and molecular levels of the organization of matter. When applied to the cellular and supra- cellular levels, they detect only phenomena of the atomic and molecular orders. On the other hand, cytology and histology are concerned exclu- sively with the form of cellular and supracellular organisms. Therefore none of these sciences alone is capable of dealing with physiological phenomena, such as organization and adaptation, which belong to the supracellular order and are the expression of sociological laws. The laws specific of physiology, said Claude Bernard, are the laws of organi- zation. Such are precisely the phenomena and the laws that the new cytology endeavors to discover by coordinating, through its own tech- niques, the data supplied about cells, tissues and organic fluids by phys- ics, physical chemistry, chemistry and classical cytology and histology. Studied in this manner, cells and tissues appear as being endowed with properties which make them not only the building stones, but also the builders of an organism capable of developing, maturing, growing old, repairing wounds and resisting or succumbing to diseases. It is with such an aspect of the tissues that embryology and pathology, as well as cytology, should be concerned. "Experimental embryology, which searches for the mechanisms of the determination and differentiation of structures, may never completely fulfil its purpose unless its conception of cells and tissues, and its tech- niques, are modified."30 30 "The New Cytology," by Dr. Alexis Carrel; supra.</page><page sequence="23">232 Structure, Function and Growth A forecast of these more recent developments, which was made in 1885, is worth quoting here: "Dr. Haldane holds that to the enlightened biologist a living organism does not present a problem for analysis; it is, qua organism, axiomatic. Its essential attributes are axiomatic; heredity, for example, is for biol- ogy not a problem but an axiom. 'The problem of physiology is not to obtain piecemeal physico-explanations of physiological processes' (I quote from the I885 address), 'but to discover by observation and experi- ment the relatedness to one another of all the details of structure and activity in each organism as expressions of its nature as one organism.... That a meeting-point between biology and physical science may at some time be found there is no reason for doubting. But we may confidently predict that if that meeting-point is found, and one of the two sciences is swallowed up, that one will not be biology.' "31 We should also note here the need for a more critical use of the concept of time and of temporal data, and for a recognition of the relativity of time for each organism.32 Different organisms live at totally different rates: a year or a day are not the same for different energy complexes which may move or function at different velocities, depending upon their unique structure-func- tion. To quote from Jerome Alexander: "A most striking example of optimum dispersion is found in living matter. Figuratively speaking, if all the chemical substances compris- ing our organism were in true or crystalloid dispersion, reactions would proceed so rapidly that we would, so to say, live ten years in ten minutes. On the other hand, if coarse dispersion prevailed, it would take ten years to live ten minutes. Every organism is dependent upon the co6rdination of its chemical reactions in point of time, and this leisurely procedure depends largely on degree of dispersion, which keeps chemical reaction velocities within certain speed limits through its regulation of free surface and kinetic activity.

The colloidal zone is, as it were, a vital metronome tolling off the tempo of life."33 To group organisms of like chronological age in scientific work is to ignore this relativity of time for each energy complex and invite unnecessary confusion. In scientific thinking, time is usually regarded as a variable, but, as the previous discussions and quotations (especially those by Dr. Carrel) have indicated, time is also a process. The rec- ognition of this is essential to future biological and social research since the time process, no less than spatial changes and energy transformations, participates in the developments under study. Reluctance to accept modifications in the conception of time is evidence of the deep-seated belief in spatial entities as the only "real things" and of the resistance to the idea of relativity in biological thinking. To accept time as the measurement of a process of varying significance depending upon the stage of development of the organism under study is to relinquish faith in many of the cherished generalizations of biology, especially of physiology, that imply, when they do not explicitly state, that physiological processes are absolute, i.e., independent of the time system of the organisms, their duration or age and previous history. These criticisms of analytic procedures and of the use of time concepts are associated with the organismic conception, which has been developed as a protest against this parceling out of an organism according to the variety of data which it may yield; it marks a movement toward the explicit recognition of the idea that an existent, such as an organism, will yield as many different kinds of data as the investigators have the techniques for dis- covering and recording, and that among these data there will be certain relationships arising from the very nature of an organism as an energy complex in a four-dimensional universe, with mul- tiple "fields" in various stages of development. This does not mean that these different data must or should be correlated, 33 "Enzymes, Vitamins and the Zone of Maximum Colloidality," by Jerome Alexander. Science, Vol. 80, No. 2064, July 20, 1934, p. 80.</page><page sequence="25">234 Structure, Function and Growth since within an organism, especially when growing and develop- ing, the process of change and adjustment and the interactions of "fields" occur with varying degrees of lags and efficiency. The study of individual organisms as they grow and develop is still so new that little is actually known of development. The analytic tradition of science that insists upon breaking down an organic whole into discrete parts and attempting to correlate two variables is the chief obstacle to the study of or- ganisms. Many investigators assert that the study of an organism instead of the restricted problem of two variables is not scientific, probably because they prefer the abstractions of anatomy and physiology and creating methods for obtaining data and establishing their meaning, which are of course primary to the study of organisms. Here again we see how the study of organic growth and development is impeded by the conceptual framework of contemporary science. "It is astonishing that, in the face of the advance of the evolutionary method in natural science, any logician can persist in the assertion of a rigid difference between the problem of origin and of nature; between genesis and analysis; between history and validity. Such assertion simply reiterates as final a distinction which grew up and had meaning in pre-evolutionary science. It asserts, against the most marked advance which scientific method has yet made, a survival of a crude period of logical scientific procedure." "The significance of the evolutionary method in biology and social history is that every distinct organ, structure, or formation, every grouping of cells or elements, is to be treated as an instrument of adjust- ment or adaptation to a particular environing situation. Its meaning, its character, its force, is known when, and only when, it is considered as an arrangement for meeting the conditions involved in some specific situation. This analysis is carried out by tracing successive stages of development-by endeavoring to locate the particular situation in which each structure has its origin, and by tracing the successive modifi- cations through which, in response to changing media, it has reached its present conformation.

Frank 235 The organismic conception, while awaiting further clarification, definitely implies a recognition that the process of growth and development, not merely the measurement of structural and functional aspects, is the focus of biological thinking and research.
