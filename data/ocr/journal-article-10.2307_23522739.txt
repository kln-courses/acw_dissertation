Cuomo Jerusalem Cassuto's conclusions regarding Judaeo-Italian are known and accept ed: this is the dialect of ancient Rome. What typifies Judaeo-Italian is its dissimilarity to its linguistic environment, both in time and place, but a similarity began to develop towards the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century. Many claim it is impossible to pinpoint definite stages in this assimi lation process. In addition it was emphasized that there is a difference between the oral and written traditions. The written tradition is more conservative and therefore archaic, whic is not true of the oral. Further research is necessary, into sources other than biblical transla tion, to find clearer evidence of the language. Research into the Italian Glosses in the "ערוך" dictionary is interesting for two reasons: their antiquity and the arbitrariness of choice. The very fact that it most cases the glosses belong to the realm of realia, proves the spontanaeity of the editor's colloquial speech. Ancient Italian manuscripts must be utilized in restoring the glosses in the "ערוך". Special attention should be given to the manuscript in the British Museum Ularg. 957 which has not as yet been studied. This is a 12th century Italian manuscript, and its perusal points up its importance, as well as that of the Glosses, in studying Judaeo-Italian and the Italian language as well. WAS THERE AN EGYPTIAN VERSION OF THE BIBLE H. Mantel Ramat-Gan Professor AlbrighEs well-known claim that there was an Egyptian version of the Bible in the Persian period is based on the existence of certain expressions in the Septuagint which he considers expressions of the veiwpoint of the Jews of Egypt in the Persian period. However, this conclusion is not compulsory, since these expressions may be interpreted in other ways.</page><page sequence="3">270 ABSTRACTS It appears that the Hebrew text from which the Septuagint was derived was the Sadducee version. Parts of the Septuagint reflect characteristic High Priest and Sadducee thought. The Pharisee text is known as the Babylonian, and it is possibly this Babylonian version which the Persian king referred to in granting Ezra entry into Jerusalem (Ezra 7:25). Close to the Septuagint version is the Samaritan version, and that of the Dead Sea sect, all of which are similar. The first translation of the Bible to come from the Pharisees, known as the "R" version, (xaive group) discovered by Barthelemy appeared after the destruction of the Second Temple, surely because the Jewish spiritual rule was handed over from the High Priest to the Pharisees. Aquila's translation was according to Rabbi Akiva's method. The aim of Symmachos, who did a second translation into Greek according to the Pharisee method, was to make it more readable for Greeks. JEWISH TRADITIONS AMONG THE BEDUINS OF SINAI Z. V1LNAY Jerusalem The story of the life of Moses and the wanderings of the Jews in Sinai which influenced Muhammed the prophet of Islam, are described in the Koran and are known from Muslim tradition. Mt. Sinai, in Arabic Tur Sina or Sinin, is mentioned several times in the Koran. From this source the stories about the Israelites in Sinai became known to its Beduin inhabitants, who were proud that God had spoken there and that the tribes of Israel had wandered in their territory. The Beduins added to the Islamic traditions legends of their own about the mountains, rocks and springs of the area. In the Middle Ages the Arabs called the north Sinai desert 77/2 Beni Israil, Israel's Desert of Wanderers. Today, this name is not common and the Beduins call it Badiat et-Tih, the desert of the Wanderers, and Jebel et-Tih, the Mountain of the Wanderers. One of the roads leading to Sinai runs along a river bed called Wadi Mukkatab, the Written Brook, because of the many inscriptions in stone found there. The Beduins believe that these were written by the Israelites. A wide valley surrounded by high mountains is called er-Raha, the Rest, since the Jews rested there from their wander ings before they were given the Torah.</page><page sequence="4">ABSTRACTS 271 Moses is called en-Nabi Musa or Sidna Musa, the prophet Moses or our Master Moses, and several places are named after him. A distinctive mountain near the Monastery of St. Catherine named Jebel Musa, the Mountain of Moses, is traditionally identified with Mount Sinai. Another mountain in the vicinity is called Jebel Munaje, short for Muna jet Musa — the talk of Moses, since this is where the silent conversation between Moses and Allah the merciful is said to have taken place. Springs among clumps of palm trees in west Sinai are called Ayun-Musa, The Springs of Moses. On the shore of the gulf of Suez, near the town of et-Tur is a hot spring named Hamman Musa, the Hot (Springs) of Moses. Many visit these springs seeking tranquility in this place where Moses is said to have bathed. A rock resembling a seat found on the road to Jebel Musa, on the side of a sharp slope, is called Maqad en-Nabi Musa, the Seat of the Prophet Moses. It is related that he sat there and reviewed the Israelites after their victories over their enemies. This is alluded to in the Bible (Ex. 17:1) and in the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 54a). Another rock found in the abovementioned Valley of the Rest is called Hajar Musa, the Stone of Moses. The Beduins claim that Moses struck this rock and water sprung from it to quench the thirst of the Israelites, who encamped there. In a dry brook there is a rock called Hajar el-Logha, the Rock of Speech, since according to tradition a voice was heard coming from it which spoke to Moses and blocked his path. After he placed his hand upon it the rock split and Moses was able to continue on his way. Aaron is also well known in the Beduin tradition as Nabi Harun, Aaron the Prophet. In the area of er-Raha, on the way to St. Catherine's monastery, there is a holy place named after Aaron. The Arab name for Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, is Shu'eib. The narrow valley in which St. Catherine's is situated is called Wadi Shueib, and a narrow path from the monastery to the top of the hill is called Sikket en-Nabi Shueib, the way of the Prophet Jethro. In the monastery there is a well named after Zipporah, Jethro's daughter, the wife of Moses. Two places in Sinai are named after Pharaoh, Arabic Farun: the Hamman Farun, hot springs in the gulf of Suez, and an island in the gulf of Eilat called Jazirat Farun, the Island of Pharaoh. The story is told that the name was given because Pharaoh and his army were drowned in this area while pursuing the Israelites.</page><page sequence="5">272 ABSTRACTS THE CHARACTER OF THE TARGUM TO JOB Y. Komlosh Jerusalem At the root of the translation of the Book of Job there are, as generally in the aramaic translations, diadactic motives, though many passages are translated verbatim. The characteristics of translations, such as avoid ance of anthropomorphism and florid description typify also the trans lation of Job. Etymological explanations are important from a lexico graphic and commentary point of view, also for the analysis of the Biblical version. The translation often deviates from the Biblical version, but this problem must be approached with caution, because this deviation may be due to a commentative intention. For example, in "בשו כי בטח באו 6,20) עדיה ויחפרו".) the verb is translated in the plural ("אתרחיצו") — which indicates that the translator read "בטחו". But it is more likely an attempt to match the three verbs in the sentence "באו"'"יחפרו"' "בטח" which caused the translator to change "בטח" to "בטחו". In some cases the translator understands the Biblical word as late Aramaic, and this changes its meaning. So 6,3) "על כן דברי לעו") is translated "טילי משתלהיך', because the translator derived "לעו" from the root לע"י , and not the root לע"ע . Sometimes the translation gives a midrashic etymology for didactic reasons, without considering the meaning of the word. Thus יהי רעב" 18,12) "אנו ואיד נכון צלעו) which refers to the evil one was translated as referring to his own son ("אנו" was understood in this way as in Genesis 49,3), i.e., that his son will be hungry for bread, and the second part of the sentence is understood as referring to his wife ("צלע", as in the story of Eve). Forty-six sentences have double translations. The first sentence is translated literally and the second, beginning with "ת" א", in a midrasihc way. Apparently the Book of Job, or a large part of it, had a midrashic translation from which the editor took some commentaries.</page><page sequence="6">ABSTRACTS 273 THE ANAGRAMMATICAL SYSTEM IN HEBREW LEXICOGRAPHY IN THE SEPHER YESIRA' N.

Eshel Jerusalem 1. It is commonly accepted that the יה ending in biblical proper names is theophoric. Tur Sinai, emphasizing the fact that in the Lakhish Ostraca personal names with the suffix יהו-, but not יה- (cf. Table I) appear, states that יהן- is the earlier form of the theophoric ending, while יה — is the later shorter form and was the result of Aramaic influence. He brought indeed many examples from the Aramaic of Elephantine with the יה- suffix. Noth agrees that יה — is short for the theophoric suffix יהו -, and points out that in may names יה - is replaced by אל which is certainly theophoric. 2. In different Semitic languages we find hundreds of names with the -ya suffix: in Akkadian documents from the 6th and 5th centuries B.C.E. (Table III), in Akkadian and Horite names from Nuzi (Table IV), in Amorite names from Mari (Table V), in Ugaritic documents (Table VII), and in Canaanite and Horite names in the El-Ammarna Tablets. Some of these names with the -ya suffix parallel biblical names with the י</page><page sequence="7">274 ABSTRACTS or י suffix and some parallel names with the יה - suffix. All told there are 120 such names in the Bible (Table VIII). 3. Since the suffix -ya is a general Semitic feature, and does not have theophoric meaning, it is appropriate to see whether this is not the case in biblical Hebrew as well. Jastrow in the last century already pointed out that in most biblical names with the יה - suffix there is no semantic relationship between the two parts of the name, and at times they even contradict so that they cannot be seen as compounded with God's name. It is clear that in the different Semitic languages ־ya meaning God did not exist, and the Suffix ־ya did not have theophoric content. According to Jastrow, it was an emphatic morpheme, while Levy thought it to be the first person possessive pronoun with vocative force, and Hoffman thought it to be a caritative morpheme. 4. As to the Hebrew names, the Masoretic text differed between יה as the name of God, as an independent word the mappiq in the heh, and the suffix יה without the mappiq, both in personal names and common nouns. In the Masoretic text, the Suffix ^-does not allude to God. It is noteworthy that in the Bible this heh interchanges with alef. According to Segal, the suffixes יהו,—יה—are emphatic morphs which express importance or an attitude of respect. It appears that the theophoric semantic content was associated with the suffix יה—in time. The con elusion is that the יה — suffix in Hebrew personal names in biblical Hebrew is not theophoric. PROBLEMS IN BIBLICAL HEBREW SYNTAX M.Z.

Altbauer Jerusalem Of the East Slavic translations of nine Biblical books (the five Scrolls, Proverbs, Daniel, Job and the Psalms) included in the Codex 262 of the Central Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in Vilnius, done by Jews from the original Hebrew text into a living vernacular of this period (15th-16th centuries), the most interesting is that of the book of Daniel: 1. The Jewish translator of this book kept the bilingual character of the original text, translating the Hebrew part of Daniel into the vernacular East Slavic (Byelorussian) and the Aramaic part (except chapter 3) into an archaic and bookish Church Slavic. 2. One can suppose that the Jewish translator had not a sufficient knowledge of Church Slavic and therefore he used as a basis for his translation of the Aramaic part an Older Church Russian translation of Daniel, but in so doing he rendered exactly the original text of the Bible, avoiding any additions and completing all passages containing omissions in the Church Russian version which was on the Septuagint, as for example:</page><page sequence="9">276 ABSTRACTS a) The Aramaic עד די שערה כ נ ש ד י ן רבה (IV, 30) is rendered in the Vilnius Codex word for word: "... donde (zo) vlasi e(ho) jako o r 1 o v i vozrastosa", while in the Old Church Russian version it is rendered: "donozde vlasi emu jako 1 o v u (= the lion) vozvelicisa", following one of the Septuagint versions. b) In chapter VI, verse 5 the phrases מצד מלכותא ('concerning the kingdom') as well as וכל־שלו ושחיתה לא השתכחת עלוהי ('neither was there any error or fault found in him') were not translated in the Old Church Russian translation, while in Codex 262 all the text was translated word by word. c) The saying וכל עלה ושחיתה ('none occasion or fault') is translated literally in Codex 262: "vsjakoja viny i poroka", while in the Old Church Russian translation there are three nouns instead of two in the original text: "voseja viny i sozblazna i grexa", following one edition of the Spetuagint versions: 3. The Russian scholar, I.E. Evseev, who edited the translation of Daniel in Codex 262 seventy years ago, did not understand the inten tion of the translator to render the bilingual character of this book and ascribed this "utraquistic" linguistic form of the translation to the Masoretical and non-Masoretical chapters in the Old Russian version of the Book of Daniel; in his opinion the translator took as a basis for his translation a previous Old Russian translation of Daniel in Church Slavic and left unchanged those chapters which were identical with the Hebrew Masoretic text. He then translated anew those chapters of Daniel which were not faithful to the Masoretic text in the Old Russian version, such as, of course, in Evseev's opinion, the chapters 1, 3 and 8-12 (this division — except of chapter 3 — corresponds to the Hebrew and the Aramaic chapters of the Book of Daniel). Evseev's conclusion was totally wrong: thus, for instance, chapter one — in his opinion a non-Masoretical chapter in the Old Russian version and for this reason translated anew in Codex 262 —- is entirely "Masoretical", except for one word in verse 3: (otD synov0;) plennic/, following the Septuagint versions. And on the other hand, in the "Masoretical" chapters, "left unchan ged" in Codex 262, there are a lot of divergences between the Old Russian version and the original text of the Bible, and all of them were corrected by the Jewish translator in his translation of Daniel.</page><page sequence="10">ABSTRACTS 277 THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIALOGUES BETWEEN SAGES AND ROMAN LEADERS M.D. Herr Jerusalem Social ties were formed between the talmudic sages and the "great men of Rome" in vari ous ways, both in Eretz Israel and in Rome itself. In talmudic literature many sources have been preserved reporting dialogues between the sages and prominent Romans, such as emperors and members of their families, governors of the province of Judea or important "matrons". In the past this matter has been investigated mainly by examining whether these talks actually took place in reality. If the party with whom the sages conversed is only referred to by his title, or his name is ambiguous (e.g. Angitus Hegemon or Antoninus), there is the additional question of the man's exact identity. Satisfactory answers have not usually been attained in these researches. However, there is a way of approaching the problem from another aspect. It seems that we must not concern ourselves with whether or not the conversation actually took place but whether is could have taken place. In other words, one must examine the subjects of the conversations between our sages and the great men of Rome and see if they have special significance. An investigation of this kind should not only be conducted for the dialogues as a whole but in particular for each pair of dialogists separately. Moreover reports of this kind are not peculiar to the world of the talmudic sages. Parallels can be found concerning other provinces and in the literature of other nations. In particular we know of the dialogues between Greek philosophers (Stoics, neo pythagorians and especially Cynics) and gymnasiarchs, emperors and high officials of Rome. Also with regard to these dialogues, the question arises concerning the reality behind them. Even though the dialogue between a philosopher and a ruler is already known at the end of the classical period, they are most frequently reported at the end of the first century and during the second century C.E. From the talmudic literature it appears that this was also the golden age of the dialogues between the sages and leading Romans. There is undoubtedly a connec tion between the two phenomena — the general-Greek and the Jewish. Like the Gentiles, the Jews also conversed with the great men of Rome. Not all that took place in reality has been preserved in the literatures nor is all that has been preserved authentic. However, an examination of the</page><page sequence="11">278 ABSTRACTS subjects of the dialogues indicates that they were not random conver sations but highly characteristic of the various dialogists and reflect political, social and spiritual problems which most occupied men of their generation. THE CANTILLATION OF THE BIBLE BY THE KARAITES S. Hofman Tel A viv The reading of the Bible, including the Haftara, occupies a most important position in public prayer on the Sabbath, as well as on holidays and festivals, in the Karaite congregation, which constitutes in Israel a community of some 10,000 persons, most of them of Egyptian origin. In common with most Oriental congregations, the Karaites read the Bible in Sika (= siga) maqam, while they render the Haftara reading in the Nahäwand maqam and the Higaz. But the Karaites have no awareness of this, even among their Rabbis and Cantors. For they have no con ception of a set of tones systematically arranged according to pitch and duration. The terms scale, key, mode, maqam, and terms relating to musical meter and rhythm have no meaning for them. The Sabbath cantillation of the Bible is used on holidays and festivals as well, except for the reading of the Ten Commandments, which is rendered (three times a year) in a different melody. The cantillation of the Haftara is also common to Sabbath and holidays, except for the Sabbaths of Tammuz, Av and Tevet. The Karaites use 21 Biblical accents for their Bible cantillation, while they use only 8 for the Haftara (!). The Karaites do not recognize the grading of the Biblical accents which is customary with Ashkenazic Jews. Most of the Biblical accents sung by the Karaites cover a range of a third to a fifth, but the range of an accent like the Ma'arik may be confined to a prime, while another, such as the Rabi'a, extends over an octave. The melodic-rhythmic content of an accent, such as the accent sofar holek for the word "ez" in Genesis i.Tl, may be merely a single sound, while another, like sene gerisbi, extends, over ten sounds.</page><page sequence="12">ABSTRACTS 279 The Karaite reading of the weekly Bible passage and the Haftara are accompanied by "Introductions'5 and "Conclusions" whose principal content is passages from the Prophets and piyyutim of Karaite poets and Jewish paytanim, like Rabbi Yehuda Halevy, who are greatly admired by the Karaite congregation. While the reading of the Bible and of the Haftara are rendered by the individual Somek, the "Introductory55 and "Closing55 passages are rendered in a most interesting form of responsorial reading. THE STATE OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF MIDDLE ARABIC IN GENERAL, AND JUDAEO-ARABIC IN PARTICULAR J. Blau Jerusalem For the philologist, the study of Judaeo-Arabic is the means for enjoying the treasures of Judaeo-Arabic literature. For the linguist, Judaeo-Arabic is one of the branches of Middle-Arabic, the connecting link between Classical Arabic and the modern Arabic dialects, and accordingly of great significance for the history of both. Yet the study of Middle-Arabic has not been adequately appreciated. Moreover, even the relatively few studies treating of the linguistic character of Middle Arabic are sometimes unknown to the sholars concerned, who have occasionally edited Middle-Arabic texts without recognizing their special lingual structure. This paper undertakes to give a short annotated bibliography of the most important Middle-Arabic linguistic studies according to their branches, viz., scientific works, popular literature, Christian Arabic and Judaeo-Arabic, from the days ofH.L. Fleischer, the first to treat Middle Arabic scientifically,to the author of this paper, who has published inter alia two grammars (of Judaeo-Arabic and of South-Palestinian Christian Arabic) and a general book, based mainly on Judaeo-Arabic material. Even a short abstract should not omit the names of A. Müller, who published the first important monograph on the Middle-Arabic of a scientific work, and of D.H. Baneth, who in many respects may be regarded as the founder of the strictly philological treatment of Judaeo Arabic texts.</page><page sequence="13">280 ABSTRACTS The task of future Middle-Arabic linguistic studies should be to inves tigate whole literary genres on the one hand, and to prepare monographs on the other. Only thus, by establishing as many points as possible on the map of Middle-Arabic, will it become possible to rewrite the history not only of Middle-Arabic but also of Classical Arabic after Islam, and the beginnings of modern Arabic dialects. DESIGN OF ITALIAN SYNAGOGUE INTERIORS D. Davidovitch Tel Aviv The synagogues of the post-Renaissance period in Italy saw the intro duction of a new arrangement of the interior which marks a definite break with the age-old tradition of invariably placing the bimah in the centre of the hall. In this new arrangement the two focal elements of the synagogue interior — the Torah shrine (Hekhal) where the Torah scrolls are stored (a sort of miniature Holy of Holies) and the bimah (teva), the raised platform for reciting the Torah, addressing and instructing the congre gation — are given equal weight from the architectural, and also largely from the ritual, viewpoints. This is achieved by leaving the Torah shrine in its usual position on the east wall, but placing the bimah on the opposite side of the hall, near its west wall — without creating the least antithesis between these two elements or detracting from the architectural harmony of the hall. In thus modifying the conventional design of the synagogue interior, which was firmly entrenched in the great centres of European, and especially Ashkenazi, Jewry, the anonymous architect successfully overcame a number of architectural — and even liturgical — problems which had always exercised the synagogue builders of the remote past. These modifications were: 1. Shifting the bimah from the centre of the hall and out of line with the Torah shrine — so that the congregation could have an unobscured view of the latter. 2. Placing the chairs and benches (also the prayer desks) along the north and south walls — for the worshippers to have a simultaneous</page><page sequence="14">ABSTRACTS 281 view of the Torah shrine and the bimah, and so be able to follow every part of the service. 3. Placing the two focal elements at either end of the hall, and so creating a central open space for the performance of certain rites and functions, such as hakkafoth (circling the synagogue with the scrolls of the law), family celebrations, etc., where the whole congregation joins in. Undoubtedly one of the most important contributary agents in the creation of the new arrangement of the synagogue interior was a religio psychological factor, which originated in the kabbalistic period. Instead of focussing attention on the bimah in the design of the synagogue and thus stressing its secular aspect as the place of communal assembly, as was common in eastern European, and especially Polish Jewry, the new arrangement which was now adopted by Italian Jewry, and in the Sephardic communities of Holland, Britain and Germany, as well as in Mediterranean countries, placed the accent on the sacral character of the synagogue by restoring the Torah Shrine to its former prominence. NEAR-EASTERN JEWISH PROVERBS: THEIR MEANING AND FUNCTION H. Jason Jerusalem In its relation to society a proverb has three aspects: (A) The proverb is used by members of the society in formal or informal situations (as in a formal court case or an informal conversation). (B) The proverb refers directly to man's activity, it "speaks" to man; it advises, directs, commands, warns and criticises man, and sums up for him the lessons of past experience so that he may draw conclusions for his future behavior. (C) The proverb fulfils a function in the society; it reacts to certain problems of man as an individual, his relations to his fellow man and society as a whole, and resolves conflicts in a certain way. The assumption here is that a proverb deals with the problematic points arising in society. It takes a certain position in the resolution of conflicts and their relation to the value system of the society. Other genres</page><page sequence="15">282 ABSTRACTS of oral literature also deal with such issues and function similarly in the social order; this role is one of the more important elements shaping oral literature. An attempt is made here to understand which of the elements in a proverb deal with the conflict and its resolution. The fabric of the proverb's meaning seems to be constructed in the following way: the multitude of concrete situations to which a proverb is applicable the general idea underlying the concrete situations the metaphor of the proverb The conflict and the proposed resolution are to be sought in the second of the above three stages: the "general idea" underlying the proverb. The gamut of problems and the proposed ways of solving them teach us about the functions of the proverb in society. NE'IMA — AN ATTEMPT AT ELUCIDATION OF THE TERM M. Smoira Jerusalem The affinity between language and music and their common origin is obvious. However, the meanings of specific musical terms and expressions have not been sufficiently examined, and the particular significance of many of them remains to be elucidated. The most interesting among those terms is NE1 IM A — melody. In Hebrew the word Ne'ima combines the noun; in the meaning of Melodie in German or melody in English, and the adjective, in the meaning of angenehm in German or pleasant in English: that is, it combines the philological sense with a connotation of aesthetic feelings. This paper attempts to trace its dual meanings in the following manner: (1) to trace its evolution by examining the sources in which it appears and the process by which an aesthetic description has evolved into a musical term; (2) to establish the various usages of the term as it appears in the texts; and (3) to clarify the specific meaning of the term Ne'ima: is it a general musical term or does it denote a specific musical mode? Are the adjectives "pleasant" or "sweet" analogous to a specially tuneful musical mode, or do they merely express appreciation of music in general ?</page><page sequence="16">ABSTRACTS 283 The paper examines the most important references in talmudic, midrashic, liturgical and apocryphal literature, and attempts to interpret their musical implication. The conclusion arrived at is that the term Ne'ima connotes singing only as distinguished from playing, and not all singing either but rather polyphonic singing — and the term Ne'ima is, indeed, derived from the aesthetic enjoyment, the pleasantness ety mologically implied in the term. This conclusion must be regarded as tentative only, and cannot be taken as definitive until corroborated by real evidence. SCIENCE OF MUSIC" AND THE JEWS OF THE 13th AND 14th CENTURIES H. Avenary Tel Aviv Jewish interest in the theoretical and philosophical aspects of music had been dormant since Philo,s time. A First Period of writing about music started with Saadya Gaon in 933, was continued by several anonymous Geniza texts, and closed with Ibn Aqnin about 1200. This literature was in the Arabic language but in the Hebrew script; it depend ed on Arabic sources, and was designed for the Oriental and Spanish Jews. In the 13th century, the interest in musical theory emerged in European Jewry (Seven texts preserved, all in Hebrew). This Second Period, initiat ed in Provence and Spain, coincided with the Paneuropean movement of acquiring non-clerical knowledge by the study of the Ancients. The kings of Sicily and Naples patronized these tendencies, employing Moors and Jews as translators. One of the latter, Abraham bar Hiyya, wrote a Hebrew encyclopedia of science, including music, for the Sages of Lunel. Provencal and Spanish Jews commissioned Hebrew versions of Saadya,s Sefer ha-Emunot, of the Musarey ha-Filosofim, and of abu al-Zalt's music treatise. The demand for musical science formed part of a general trend towards a secular culture in the Hebrew language. The same idea prompted Hebrew poets to compete with troubadour song and with foreign fiction books then current in Jewish homes. The 14th century brought about a new wave of musical writings in</page><page sequence="17">284 ABSTRACTS Hebrew (Six texts preserved). This Third Period began exploiting Euro pean sources. These endeavours were apparently connected with the Proto-Renaissance movement fostered by Robert d'Anjou who knew Hebrew himself. Among the Jewish translators employed by this king was Kalonymos ben Kalonymos who translated, among others, Al Farabi into Hebrew. Musical knowledge was also offered by the Hebrew versions of Plato and other classics. Relations with gentile scholars were maintained by Levi ben Gershom and two anonymous compilers of Marchetto's and J. Vaillant's musical teachings. Most probably the music treatise of Yehuda ben Isaac belongs to this period; its preface expresses Jewish self-consciousness by quoting Immanuel of Rome. The latter's writings frequently refer to music in a positive sense. It is worth noting that the Jewish interest in cosmopolitan learning did not weaken its bonds with Hebrew culture. Recovering the lost science of music was one of the means to overcome exile conditions by extending the national culture to the secular fields of life. THE PRESENCE OF GHOSTS IN THE JEWISH MOROCCAN HOME I. Ben-Ami Jerusalem The period under consideration is the traditional period, before the French influence, which became decisive in the 1920s. An examination of the different beliefs and customs relating to spirits brings us to the conclusion that the link between the Jew and the spirit was very strong. We will not be able in this narrow framework to examine the whole scheme of relations, which is very involved, but will restrict ourselves to a designation of several aspects. When a Jew is born, according to tradition, his double among the spirits is also born and this spirit accompanies him through his life. Upon his death the spirit also dies. The relationship obligates the Jews to a certain behavior. For example, anger is forbidden because in such a way the mood of the spirit is spoiled and it might seek revenge. A Jewish musician testified before me that his fingers are animated by a spirit when he plays his instrument.</page><page sequence="18">ABSTRACTS 285 The spirit, or spirits, have among themselves the same differentiation that exists among us, i.e. good and evil spirits, present and living in the house. And therefore the wife is very cautious not to spill hot water, lest she harm it and arouse his anger. When a son is born, he is subject for eight days, until his circumcision, to the danger of immediate attack from the spirits who have not yet received the new resident. And therefore, every evening until the circum cision, we are witness to the interesting ceremony called Tehdid which expresses itself in the father's banging with a sword on the walls of the room in order to drive away the spirits. A boy or girl, even of adolescent age, will never sleep alone lest he or she be visited by the spirits. The period before and during the wedding is the most dangerous and requires extreme supervision on the part of the couple. The spirit or spirits can harm the couple or even kidnap them. If the bridegroom leaves the nuptial room, leaving his bride alone for a moment, upon his return she'll be a virgin no longer. Many wedding customs can be understood only in the context of fear of spirits. Upon the death of a Jew, and at the moment of lowering him into the grave, it is customary to scatter gold dust or to throw silver coins., The gold or silver is intended for the spirits who are busy gathering it up and consequently cannot do harm. The author thinks that with the death of the Jew, comes the death of his spirit double, and therefore his spirit family is angered at the deceased and his family and seeks revenge from him or them. The spirits are found everywhere, but there are special centers by the street of the butchers (because of the blood) and likewise at the cemetery. A Jew who falls in the street or drops something does so as a result of the hostility of the spirit, who trips him. Diseases are caused by the spirits. A woman, for example, whose children die one after another, is thought of as being persecuted by her double or by another spirit whom she must appease. There exists a taboo on mentioning the spirits, and one does not speak willingly of such matters, nor without touching the floor three times or saying a certain blessing. The proximity between the life of the spirit and the life of the Jew, as has been said, is very great and felt throughout a lifetime. The spirit is, therefore, more than a permanent guest; he is essentially apart of the home scene and the family framework. This link requires comprehensive and deep research.</page><page sequence="19">286 ABSTRACTS YESHU BEN-HANAN, PROPHET OF THE END OF THE SECOND TEMPLE E. Bin Gorion Tel Aviv This discussion is based on the references made by Josephus to Jesus ben Ananias (Hananiah), a man of the people, who appeared in Jerusalem in the period preceding the destruction of the Second Temple and prophe sied its downfall (Wars of the Jews, VI, V, para. 3). The passage has been almost neglected by historians, but Micah Joseph bin Gorion (Berdi chevsky) has pointed out that it could constitute the sole piece of external evidence, often sought but never discovered, relating to the appearance, gospel, conduct and career, trial and death of Jesus of Nazareth. The discussion raises a number of points concerning the legendary aspect of the figure of the "prophet of destruction". This is expressed in its clas sical form, for example, in the account of the prophecy of Cassandra concerning the destruction of Troy (which incidentally is the second destruction of Troy mentioned in Greek legend) and in the account of the tragic end of the prophetess herself. Concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, a reference to prophecies foretelling the end of the First Temple is preserved in the biblical epic. These are principally attributed to Jeremiah, whose sufferings, due to his prophecy of disaster, are related in tradition, as well as the trial at which he was arraigned, although he subsequently lived to an advanced age, remaining at liberty after the fulfilment of the prophecy. The Gospels contain clear allusions to a tradition according to which Jesus of Nazareth was a prophet of the destruction, and was actually tried and put to death following his prophecy. These references can, however, be explained more clearly by comparison of the mythical legendary and theological-religious evidence with that yielded by the secular account of Jesus ben Ananias. Apart from the direct historico religious implications of the researches of Micah Joseph Berdichevsky for the history of Christianity, this simple but vivid account of the appearance of Jesus ben Ananias demonstrates the reciprocal relation ship between history and chronology on the one side, and the weaving of myth and legend on the other, exemplified here by the stereotype of the prophecy of destruction of a city and temple.</page><page sequence="20">ABSTRACTS 287 SURVEY OF JEWISH DRESS IN BUKHARA — IS THERE A DISTINCTIVE STYLE? A. Lancet-Müller Jerusalem A preliminary survey of the material culture of Jews in Bokhara (Uzbekistan) from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, was made during the collection of objects and the preparation of a catalogue for the "Bokhara" exhibition at the Israel Museum (Nov. 1967 to June 1968, Catalogue No. 39). The survey was made to include all objects used by Jews — most of them secular items — without consideration of their "Jewishness", as determined by L.A. Mayer ("L'Art Juif en Terre de rislam", a A. Kuindig, Geneve 1959), namely that an object be considered "Jewish" only if it bears a Hebrew inscription or has been used for Jewish religious purposes. The material was sorted and classified according to technical data. The problem of ascertaining specifically Jewish characteristics in dress and ornamentation, together with hypo thetical assumptions raised during the survey, are being presented here for further discussion. Characteristics specific to Jewish costume and jewellery have been found to date among Jews of Yemen and Morocco. It now appears that at the other end of the Islamic world — in Bokhara — no difference existed between the clothes of Jews and those of Moslems, except for minor well-defined details. Even these were not the product of indepen dent creation, but rather the remnants of obligatory features, forced upon the Jews, in order to distinguish them in the street from Moslems, (special fur hats — "Telpak" — and string-belts for men), or else' were traces of traditions brought relatively recently from Persia (spangle embroidered tulle scarves for women and dresses in this same work for brides). In our quest for the facts underlying this lack of Jewish idiom in one country and its existence in another, it may be assumed in general that in an area where Jews did not form an artisan class, their occupations not being creative in the main, no specific features in their dress and ornament were to be found. For Bokhara, more particularly, the fact should be taken into consideration that Jews in Uzbekistan were all urban, mostly merchants, belonging to what could be regarded in their 19th century Asiatic society as the high bourgeois class, maintaining close commercial contacts with remote countries. They were bringing</page><page sequence="21">288 abstracts goods from Europe (mainly Russia), China and India, and with these goods also came different styles, the influence of which was strongly felt in local fashions. Moreover, segregation from their Moslem neighbours was not as strict in the Jewish "Mahala" of Bokhara, as it was in the "Kasba" of Morocco, or the "Ga' el-Yahud" in Yemen. A further point in consideration: notwithstanding constant restrictions and periodic severe persecutions, Jews were close to the court of the omnipotent Emir who would honour some of the Jewish notables, just as he honoured some of his Moslem subjects, by bestowing upon them splendid robes, the works of his court craftsmen. We find, therefore, Bokharan Jewry in the period treated — and especially since the beginning of the Russian occupation in 1868 — relatively open to external and internal influences, their material culture carrying a certain "cosmopolitan" tinge, naively uppish in its richness, but certainly remarkable for its seemingly endless variety and the splen dour of its wear — some slight consolation for its lack of contribution to the repertoire of characteristic Jewish artifacts. THE ANGEL OF DEATH IN JEWISH AND ISLAMIC FOLKLORE H. Schwarzbaum Tel Aviv To the common folk in all ages and in all parts of the world Death is a terrible desperate reality which mortals cannot escape. The enig matic and quite impenetrable mystery of Death has agitated the mind of man since time immemorial, calling forth emotions of dread, awe and extreme anxiety. The Angel of Death occupies a prominent place in Jewish and Moslem folk literature and folk life, where there is a conspi cuous tendency to portray Death as a living personality exercising a vast influence on the life of a mortal. This tendency to personify Death is, however, not limited to the folklore of Judaism and Islam but is extant in that of many religions and cultures as well. Thus in the Ancient Ugaritic mythological texts Death personified as Mot is engaged in a perpetual struggle with Baal, the god of fertility and life. It is hardly surprising in the cultural legacy of the Ancient Near East, the concept of the God of Death, or in later folklore the notion</page><page sequence="22">ABSTRACTS 289 of the Angel of Death firmly established itself as a figure striking man with awe and terror. In my unpublished monograph I have had occasion to deal comprehensively with all the aspects and motifs bearing on Death, personified in an enormous body of ancient and modern folkloristic material (such as legends, myths, folktales, fables, exempla, proverbs, folksongs, folk beliefs, superstitions e*c.), gathered around the full fledged personality of Death, with special emphasis on Sammael and 'Azrail, the Jewish and Moslem Soul-Snatchers respectively. It should, however, be stressed here that there is a basic difference between the Jewish and Moslem views of the Angel of Death. While in Jewish folklore the Angel of Death is usually identified with Satan (and frequently with the Yezer Hara, cf. Baba Batra 16a) and has all the extremely negative traits and features of a demonic figure, in Moslem folklore the Angel of Death, 'Azrail, is portrayed as a quite propitious and beneficial personality, as a serviceable harmless Angel, a faithful Messenger of Allah, treated with the same deference as the other Three Archangels (Jibrail, Mikail and Israfil). 'Azrail is not pleased with his "Job1' of soul-snatcher (Arabic: "Kabid"). He has, however, to submit to the order given by Allah. The mass of material on this subject collected by me gives details on various motifs current both in Jewish and Moslem folklore, always indicating the similar themes (i.e. the so-called "Narrative Types and Motifs") in world folklore, such as, the character and functions of Sammael and 'Azrail respectively, the origin of Death, the creation of man and Death, how does Death take away the souls of the righteous and the wicked, the wiles of the Death Angel, the Angel of Death out witted by a mortal (e.g. Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi etc. etc.), the Death Angel may err too (cf. Bab. Talmud, Hagigah 4b), the envoys of Death, the Torah as a weapon against the Angel of Death, the compassionate Death Angel is punished, a mortal fights with Death (e.g. Moses in various Midrashic accounts as well as in old Moslem sources), the Angel of Death has no power over Saints, etc. etc. The present lecture examines a few motifs in detail, indicating the development of ancient motifs throughout the ages. It should be emphasized that many Jewish and Moslem folklore motifs, rooted in ancient sources, still survive in contemporary folklore.</page><page sequence="23">290 ABSTRACTS CHIRONOMY AND HEAD MOVEMENT IN RECITING THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES A. Laufer Jerusalem The first part of the lecture will present ancient sources testifying to the existence of chironomy (The sources will be taken from the Gemara, Rashi, Grammer-books, and travelogues). The second part will treat chironomy and head movements as symbols of the musical signs of the Torah used while reading in the Torah. Traces of these movements have remained in some Jewish communities until the present generation. The following are examples of the methods used in these communities. Morocco, Rabat; A series of movements is performed by the right hand or by the head of the Torah reader himself at the time he "plays" the words. The movements do not assist the reader but are accompanying the notes. They accompany the terminating notes only. Morocco, Fez: In this community two types of movements are em ployed: 1. Head movement — movements made by the reader of the Torah when he "plays5' the word with the terminating notes — in a manner resembling the method customary in Rabat. 2. Hand movements — when the person who is called up to the Torah cannot read the notes expertly, the somech helps him with accepted signs made by the right hand or by both hands. Egypt: In this community two methods were used: 1. The method of notes with hand movements — this method was customary in the teaching of Torah reading with notes in the heder. In this method the teacher signalled almost all the notes with both his hands. 2. The method of help by the somech — this method was used in the public reading of the Torah. When the Torah reader falters in his reading, the somech helps him by agreed signs (representing the notes) which he signals on the back of the reader. This method was used only in emergencies and has only seven signs. Djerba (an island belonging to Tunisia): A series of agreed signs is employed which the masmich re-forms with the fingers of his right hand on the back of the Torah reader.</page><page sequence="24">ABSTRACTS 291 Yemen, San'a: The notes are divided into four groups, each group having its special sign made by the right hand. Italy, Rome: A series of movements symbolizing some of the notes of the Torah has been developed in order to help the reader. Advice will be given concerning research. [A film about chironomy was shown, demonstrating movements of hands and head made while reading the Torah, which have remained in use in communities of Egypt, (Morocco), Djerba and Yemen.] COMPUTERIZED STATISTICAL LINGUISTICS AND THE PROBLEM OF THE UNITY OF THE BOOK OF ISAIAH Y.T. Radday Haifa The following test is one of many which were applied to the text of Isaiah in order to quantify, and thus to objectify, the problem of its unity. The main value of such tests is that they investigate language habits of which the author himself was unaware and which were beyond his conscious control. Frequencies of transitions were counted by a computer between four parts of speech in six chapter groups. The differences between the findings were then statistically examined as to the probability that these groups may have originated in a common language population. When Wickmann (T.H., Aix-la-Chapelle, Germ.) applied this test to the writings of Goethe, Kant and Herder, he found that with sample pairs drawn from the same author the probability of a common origin fluctuated between 8 and 70 p.c., while cross-compari son between the authors showed probabilities fluctuating between 1020־ and 10-135 p c. (seil. 0.01 = conventionally written 10-2). Wickmann has thus proved transition frequencies to be a reliable charac teristic for homogeneity diagnosis. Since, however, he based himself on twelve parts of speech, whereas in Isaiah only four such were distin guished, it is only reasonable to expect less eccentric values. The following table shows the probability values found (in p.c.). It may be concluded that (a) Groups A and B were most probably written by the same author;</page><page sequence="25">292 ABSTRACTS (b) Group D is completely isolated; (c) the chances that Groups C, D, E and F were written by the author of Group A are practically nil; and (d) Groups C, E and F consist of heterogeneous material. Twenty other tests confirmed these conclusions almost without exception. Chapter B C D E F Group chs. 13-23 chs. 24-35 chs. 40-48 chs. 49-57 chs. 58-66 A chas. 1-12 24.0 0.001 0.00001 0.00001 1.8 B — 3.2 0.001 0.01 10.0 C — 0.7 4.5 0.9 D — — — 0.1 0.1 E — 0.01 TWO COMMENTARIES ON THE 'CANON' OF AVICENNA [THE SECTION ON THE ANALOGY OF THE PULSE ACTION TO THE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC] A. Shiloah Jerusalem At the centre of our study stand two fragments by two Sephardic Jewish authors, which have two common factors. Both of them appear in the same collection of medical books and are both commentaries of the same passage which deals with the parallel between the action of the pulse and of music, which appears in the famous work by the Arab philosopher Ibn-Sina — Kitab al-Qanun fi al-tibb. The two fragments were published, one whole and one in sections, by the scholar Moritz Steinschneider. The first is the commentary of Ishayahu ben Itzhak which was published in "Bet Otsar Ha-Siphrut", year 1, 70, 29-32 (Varaslav 5647), and the second one, the commentary of Abu Amran Mussa Ibn Allawi, published in "Hamaskir" vol. 19, pp. 43-44 (Berlin 1879). Though it is true that the published passage was the commentary of Abu Amran it is only a quotation from among the other quotations included in the</page><page sequence="26">ABSTRACTS 293 long passage which is the commentary of Shem Tov ben Itzhak Shaprut. The quotation itself forms less than a quarter of the commentary. This fact caused other errors among those who copied Steinschneider and relied on him. This new discovery changes the situation because it permits us to make a comparison between two different Hebrew transla tions and interpretations of the same passage. Ibn-Sina, when he com pares the action of the pulse to the bases of music, speaks in a lucid manner about two aspects, the melodic and the rhythmic. Ishayahu ben Itzhak, in spite of quoting Ibn-Sina word for word, avoids completely the rhythmical aspect, while Shem Tov ben Itzhak Shaprut deals effect ively with this latter aspect. On the other hand the quotation on Ibn Amran relates only to melodic intervals. We observe that even from this point of view our discovery has entirely changed the picture. Another matter is the parallel between the action of the pulse and music appearing in a medical context. As is known, the relationship between music and medicine appears in various forms; in our case it is connected with the series of cosmological phenomena in which number and proportion are at the base of reality and explain every phenome non by it. These same ideal proportions of the musical harmony, the fruit of the doctrines of Pythagoras, are the base of all harmony in existence and in man. We find them also in the explanation of the function of the pulse. A pulse that functions according to those proportions is a proof of health, and a pulse departing from them is an indication of illness. JEWISH FOLK DANCE CUSTOMS AS REFLECTED IN THE MEMORIAL LITERATURE OF THE EUROPEAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES Z. Friedhaber Haifa The memorial literature of the Jewish communit;es who perished in the Holocaust that struck our people hides in itself among other things chap ters on popular types, folklore and personal reminiscences, that throw new light on many customs of living whose existence was unknown or very little known to us.</page><page sequence="27">294 ABSTRACTS The importance of the chapters on the people and personal recollec tions is extremely great, for they were not written by folklore specialists but by people who were eye witnesses of or participants in events that they present, or at least knew by hearsay from first hand sources, that is from the father's home or at least from the grandfather's home. It is clear that among these chapters on the people there are also dance customs, descriptions of dances, names of dances and dancers. If we have found in this literature many sources to complete our knowledge in different areas of folklore, this is many times more true regarding Jewish dance which is a step-child in the spheres of Jewish folklore research. There is no area of Jewish life where the dance was not known and the descriptions which we meet now will testify to this. There are, presented new dance customs, names and forms of dances during the marriage ceremony and Jewish festivals, but the canvas in this literature is far broader and contains also dances during feasts of all kinds of Jewish societies, during meetings of Hassidim and when the Sefer Torah is carried to the Ark, and even children's dances about which so little has been written. When the memorial literature revealed hidden chapters of the dance character of different Jewish communities, it helped also to solve pro blems which had been previously sources of controversy and much debate among scholars of folklore; now with the publications of all kinds of different dance customs in the memor'al collections these controversies have been settled among the members of the community and new merry-making customs have been brought to life, and by additional authentic sources our knowledge has been increased. Therefore the importance of these memorial books is very great. SEMI-MOBILE SEWÄ S. Morag Jerusalem The paper deals with the concept «שיא "נע מעט in medieval grammati cal sources and in the present day reading traditions of Hebrew. The term occurs in the Massoretic treatise mahberet hattigän (the Hebrew version); here it is employed for the sewä in forms like</page><page sequence="28">ABSTRACTS 295 וידבר The concept שוא "נע מעט" is also found in the present-day reading tradition of biblical Hebrew extant in the Iraqi community. (The use of the term seems to die out, but it is still employed by some of the older members of the community). In this community the termis used for a medial sewä when this Sewä does not come in a geminated letter and when it is not preceded by a quiescent sewä — in other words: in the above reading tradition a שווא "נע מעט" is a medial sewä, that, according to the terminology of the Kimhi school, follows a תנועה גדולה Such a sewä occurs in forms like 1?T (Gen, 3,5,), ,"!*?P (ibid., 16), etc. The שוא "נע מעט" is realized in the Iraqi reading tradition as an ultra short vowel, [9] (whereas the ordinary sewä is realized as an ordi nary vowel, [e]; qualitatively, the vowel representing the שוא "נע מעט" may be assimilated to the preceding or the following vowel. Thus ר?בי (Gen. 49, 17) is realized as [,ro:x0 bo]. In the readrng tradition of post-biblical Hebrew extant in the Iraqi community (as well as in some other 'oriental' communities) a sewä following a תנועה גדולה is, as a rule, realized as a quiescent Sewä. It appears that the realization of this sewä as an ultra-short vowel in the reading-tradition of biblical Hebrew in this community reflects a stage which in the development of the traditional pronunciation of the com munity preceded the reduction of this vowel to zero. In his book הליכות שבא R. Selomo Almoli (who flourished in the end of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century (C.E.) says, in contradisfinction to R. David Kimhi's statement, that the sewä that follows a תנועה גדולה is quiescent. It is shown that the reading tradition of the Iraqi community in post-biblical texts discloses accord to Almoli's statement; in biblical texts, however, this tradition is in accord with the rules given by Kimhi (and other authorities). DIVERGENT MODES OF TRANSLATION IN TWO LATIN VERSIONS OF ECCLESIASTES B. Kedar-Kopfstein Haifa A comparison between different translations of the same text might help to clarify a number of problems in translation arising from the</page><page sequence="29">296 ABSTRACTS structural differences between languages. Since absolute correspondence between the translation and the original is in any case unattainable, many possibilities of translation exist. Every translation reflects certain aspects of the original, while failing to convey other components. The availability of two translations by the same translator at different times presents an opportunity to trace the changes in the principles which guided the translator in his rendering. Two translations of the Book of Ecclesiastes by Jerome are extant. The well-known one, in the Vulgate, was apparently completed in 398. But there is also a second translation: about ten years previously Jerome had prepared a commentary on Ecclesiastes. The headings (lemmata) to the commentary depart from the Septuagint in many details, and the Latin differs greatly from that employed in the earlier translation. It may thus be deduced that these lemmata do not reflect the text of the "Vetus Latina" in its original form. They either represent a Latin trans lation emended and revised by Jerome or an extempore translation of his own. At all events, the lemmata to his commentary on the Book of Ecclesiastes bears the sure stamp of Jerome,s work. Considerable divergences exist between the two translations, although the many similarities should not be overlooked. The differences are observable on two levels, the semantic level, i.e., translation of the isola ted word, or the syntactical level, i.e., translation of grammatical forms, of verbal combination and idioms. The translation of the lemmata (=L) shows an almost lexicographical consistency, each given Hebrew word having what may be regarded its exact Latin parallel which serves for every context. A similar literal identification is found in the Vulgate (=V), which in most cases does not differ from the translation of L. However, some deviation from the standard literal equation does appear. Although not numerous, these deviations are sufficient to change the character of the V translation considerably. They may be divided into two main categories: a. The substitution of a Latin synonym for the usual Latin rendering of a given Hebrew word. b. The choice of a Latin word according to context, disregarding the accepted meaning of the Hebrew word and its usual Latin rendering. It should be pointed out that the first category of deviations is the more frequent, the wish for stylistic variety being stronger than the search for semantic accuracy. Only a few examples are given here. (More examples are adduced in the Hebrew Section).</page><page sequence="30">ABSTRACTS 297 V L Ecc. 2:4 domos domos בתים But: Ecc. 7:4 ubi tristitia est in domo luctus בבית אבל ubi laetitia in domo laetitiae בבית שמחה Ecc. 4:14 de carcere de domo מבית הסורים catenisque vinctorum Ecc. 7:1 dies... die dies. . . diem (יום (המות But: (מיום(הולדו Ecc. 12:3 quando in die (ביום (שיזעו Ecc. 7:10 priora tempora dies priores שהימים הראשונים An examination of the grammatical and syntactical aspects shows basic similarities between L and V. Both imitate to a great extent the structure of the Hebrew sentence; both are based on a close identification between the Hebrew and Latin formal-grammatical categories (e.g. ים — Latin plural; cf. 4:1 — the oppressions העשקים — V, L — calum nias;תי — past of Latin verb 8:15 שכחתי — laudavi: V, L.) However, Y departs farther from the Hebrew model in this sphere also. Thus there are transitions from one category to another, e.g. from verb to noun and vice versa: V L Ecc. 4:17 oboedientia ut audias וקרוב) לשמע) Ecc. 4:8 et tarnen laborare non est finis ואין קץ לכל עמלו non cessat ommi labori eius noun to adverb: Ecc. 1:13 sapienter in sapientia ולתור) בחכמה) (But Ecc. 2:21 in sapientia — V, L — בחכמה) The following are a few examples of deviations from the usual trans lation model (cf. Hebrew article). Conjuctions of two verbal forms: Ecc. 4:7 considerans reperi conversus sum egoet vidi ושבתי אני ואראה Plural active to singular passive Ecc. 3:14 ut timeatur ut timeant a facie eius שיראו לפניו</page><page sequence="31">298 ABSTRACTS The construct form is usually translated by the Latin genitive; both translations do so in the majority of cases. Deviations from this rule are found in V in the following examples: Ecc. 7:5 a sapienti corripi correptionem sapienti גערת חכם Ecc. 10:1 muscae morientes muscae mortis זבובי מות The tendency of V, in contrast to L, to depart from the Hebrew original is especially evident in the translation of paranomasia, common in the Bible in general, as well as in the Book of Ecclesiastes. V L Ecc. 2:18 industriam meam laborem meam את כל עמלי שאני עמל quam studios:ssime quem ego laboro laboravi (cf. verses 19, 20) Ecc. 2:14 unus utriusque eventus unus מקרה אחד esset interitus eveniet omnibus eis יקרה את כלם The departure of V from the Hebrew original enables the introduction of exegetic elements: Ecc. 2:12 כי מה האדם quid est, inquam, homo quis est hominum qui ut sequi possit regem possit ire post שיבוא אחרי המלך factorem suum regem atque את אשר כבר עשוהו factorem Ecc. 2:3 abstrahere a vino ut traherem in vino למשך ביין בשרי carnem meam carnem meam Ecc. 6:8 ut pergat illuc ut vadat ubi est vitam contra vitam להלך נגד החיים The two methods of translation reflect clearly Jerome,s development as a translator. Initially, he was strict in adhering to the linguistic model of the original (cf. for instance, his translation of the Minor Prophets). Later, however, he concentrated on the content and ideas conveyed by the original and endeavoured to express them in a more polished Latin style (for instance the Book of Esther).</page><page sequence="32">ABSTRACTS 299 Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, The first trans lation of the Book of Ecclesiastes, although inferior in its Latin style, is an adequate guide to the original; the Ecclesiastes of the Vulgate, on the other hand, while again not an absolute rendering, through its fluent translation virtually becomes a work of art in its own right. ON THE PHOENICIAN VOWEL SHIFT A. Dotan Tel Aviv The a&gt; o shift occurred in part of the Canaanite languages in the case of long vowels. It is usually assumed that in Phoenician and Punic this shift has also spread to short vowels which, by reason of being stressed, were lengthened and so became liable to this vowel shift. Here an attempt has been made to show that we have no reliable evidence of an a&gt;0 shift in stress-lengthened short vowels. Examination of the relevant material shows that in part of the cases the Phoenician basic form is not the same as the Hebrew one (noun classes and verb forms), so that one cannot conclude from one language to the other, while in other cases the vowels became lengthened not because of stress but for other reasons (softening of the gutturals, continuation of an old Canaanite process, etc.). The conclusion is therefore that the old Canaanite a&gt; o shift took place in Phoenician and Punic and even continued to operate in New Punic, but only in long vowels and not in short ones, even if these were allegedly lengthened by reason of stress. And since the existence of this shift was the only evidence of the influence of the stress on the vowel system, proof that this shift did not exist, automatically invalidates the evidence of that influence and deprives us of a hugely important indica tion of the place of stress in Phoenician and Punic.</page><page sequence="33">300 ABSTRACTS ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THE STYLE OF THE HEBREW SONG WITH THE AID OF THE COMPUTER R. Katz and D. Cohen Jerusalem The Israeli folk song is analyzed with the aid of the computer as an example of computer analysis of monophonic music. The musical material was prepared for the computer in two ways: (1) by numerical representation of the notes of the melodies in order of their occurrence, and (2) by classifying each song in terms of its musical properties (range, tempo, musical form, etc.). The rows of numbers yield information concerning the frequency of occurrence of single notes, pairs of notes, groups of three, etc. in different places in the melody. This part of the analysis is best expressed in terms of Multi-Dimensional Scalogram Analysis, which makes possible comparisons of the "profiles" of melo dies — that is, the extent of resemblance in the sequential order of notes and motifs. The classification of songs according to their musical properties yields information concerning each of the properties, the interrelationships among properties, the factors contributing to the definition of the several modes characteristic of Israel song as well as the relationships among modes. Going beyond the stylistic analysis of the Israeli song, the study also contributes more generally to an under standing of the character and definition of musical parameters. The songs chosen for study are from the late thirties, forties and fifties, and represent what is thought to be the "true" Israeli folk song. THE SHEKEL OF TYRE OF THE AUTONOMOUS TYRIAN MINT A. Ben-David Jerusalem The Tyrian Mint began operating around 450 BCE and for 500 years maintained a stable currency and a good name. The Sages of the Mishnah trusted implicitly in the Tyrian currency, despite the fact that they were engraved with idolatrous symbols, and even more remarkably, despite the fact they were under Roman rule and</page><page sequence="34">ABSTRACTS 301 should have used the Roman currency. The wide use of Tyrian money may be attributed to their full weight and high silver content, in contrast to other coins of the period. Tyrian coins reached Palestine through merchants, and mainly through pilgrims who paid the half-shekel at the Temple in Tyrian currency. The paper discusses the question of how much silver was brought to the Temple annually. The Mint was closed down—despite its rentability—by Nero, in pre paration for a devaluation he made in the year 64/63 C.E. The drastic devaluation in his own currency necessitated eliminating his competitor, the Tyrian Mint. Against this background the author illustrates the great interest shown by the Tannaim of the fifth generation (lead by Rabbi Simon ben Gamliel) in the Tyrian currency. They feared the supply of coins would eventually be depleted and wanted to establish laws to handle this problem. A CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE VARIANTS AND PARALLELS IN AGGADA AND FOLK TALE Z. Kagan Haifa The laws governing the legend and the folk tale are the same as apply to all literary production. Variations of context create variations of form according to the rule: the context is the question and the form is the answer. This rule also applies to the variants and the parellels in the legend and the folk tale. The distinction is made here between variant and parallel. Variant means the same tale differing from the other in essence, idology and artistic character. By parallel is meant a different tale, similar to another parallel, an affinity clearly visible in subject, plot, idea, etc. The right of existence of each variant and parallel lies in its individual character. Each expresses a given attitude to life which determines both its unity of context and its form. This time we have chosen models where there are variants and parallels, one of which is short and the other extended. Even when appearing to be</page><page sequence="35">302 ABSTRACTS only an abbreviation or extension, the difference is not merely technical but meaningful, determined by what is more important, secondary, central or marginal. Model 1. — The short variant (Rashi) and the long variant (Gaster) in the legend of the weasel and the pit. The difference between the short and the extended variant is not only quantitative. The center of the former is man. There is a lengthy descri ption, implicit rather than explicit in its statement. The existence of forces from another world is indicated whose origin we cannot clearly ascertain and which we cannot command. Therefore, there is no place for correction or a peaceful conclusion. The world inclines to tragedy. The center of the extended variant is a supreme power and all other powers outside this world which act upon us are its messengers. Here there is correction and a conclusion because the world is protected and sealed by the seal of higher providence. These differences in context must lead to differences in form. The two variants incline to two literary types: the short one to the "Sage", and the long one to the "Legenda". The latter is full of marvels, because it's duty is to strengthen the belief in highest providence. The theodicean tendency of the Legenda leads to an admixture of supernatural motifs and the broadening of the tale. Model 2 — A short variant (Adarn 56, 1) and an extended variant (Adam 56, 2) of the legend "What was the beginning of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus?" The short variant presents a more anthropocentric and realistic attitude to life. Rabbi Eliezer himself determines the couse of his life and executes his design with the help of his powers. The extended variant places the supreme power and its messenger Elijah the Prophet in the central position. They both help the weak and irresolute man to accomplish his aim. The addition of the supernatural element also leads to a broadening of the tale. The two variants incline to two literary types: the first to the Sage and the second to the Legenda. Model 3 — Three parallels of the tale-type No. 960: "He'll reveal His righteousness". The central motif in our parallels is the discovery of a murder revealed by a tree or plant growing on the tomb of the victim (motif E 631). This particular tale-type flourishes in all Jewish communities and many versions and parallels of it are preserved in the Israel Folktale Archive (= IFA). The two extended parallels (from Yemen 119, and from Egypt</page><page sequence="36">ABSTRACTS 303 IFA No. 2093) emphasize supernatural motifs. In the first the pumpkin reveals a murder by speaking itself (through a ghost in the pumpkin). In the second parallel the plant drips blood. The third parallel, the short one, which exists both orally and in writing (a chain parallel) is more realistic. The plant attracts attention by ripening prematurely. A similar short tale (from Morocco, IFA No. 3912) about Rabbi Haim ben Attar, who discovered a thief with the help of a tree, manifests a realistic and rationalistic aim. In conclusion, the two different methods of story-telling in the legend and the folk-tale mean two different forms and two different conceptions of existence.</page></plain_text>
