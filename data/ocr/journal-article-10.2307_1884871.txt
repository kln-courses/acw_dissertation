Professor Mitchell finds their discussions "dull" (if taken literally), and their conclusions "dubi- ous." Professor Slichter holds that "Orthodox doctrine is formulated with as little reference to machinery, science applied to industry, corporations, trade unions, the credit system, commercial and investment bankers, as were the theories of Adam Smith." Mr. Soule alludes to "the barrenness of premature senescence which has existed in economic science." Professor Tugwell is quite as severe: "Economics incontestably has got a bad metaphysical odor that only a renaissance of rebuilding from the ground up can dissipate." But a more careful examination reveals that these extreme views are exceptional. Outside of the chapters contributed by the writers who have just been quoted, there appears to be little disposition to raise the red flag of scientific revolution. All shades of opinion re- specting the methods and content of economics are represented. There are radicals, there are conservatives, and there are some who occupy a middle position. I shall find it convenient, in surveying these varied chap- ters, to follow a path that runs generally, tho not con- sistently, from the right toward the left. Professor Knight's chapter on "The Limitations of Scientific Method in Economics" would give distinc- tion to any book. Because I put Professor Knight among the conservatives, it should not be inferred that he undertakes a general defense of prevailing eco- nomic doctrines. He is conservative merely in that he insists that the credentials of all projects for the radical reconstruction of economics be submitted to careful scrutiny. He is not willing to follow a new way just be- cause it happens to be the mode. But his attitude ap- pears to be without prejudice. The old methods and</page><page sequence="3">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS the new have to measure up to the same logical stand- ards. In short, Professor Knight thinks for himself. Moreover, his knowledge of psychology and of the methods of science equips him adequately for his task. The general run of his argument is somewhat as fol- lows. Science is instrumental, concerned with control, with means rather than ends. It supplies, in effect, an elaborate technique of prediction. Yet it is of small help in many of the practical decisions of life. It fails most notably in the prediction of human behavior and of social changes. Behaviorism fails, first, because in rejecting con- sciousness it rejects a useful datum. Science itself finds it convenient to retain an element of animism, and science, as a part of intellectual life, is built on inter- communication, which implies the recognition of the consciousnesses of others. Behaviorism fails, second, because the reactions of different persons are not alike. For one thing, no two of them have passed through pre- cisely the same experiences. There is no stable relation, common to all persons, between stimulus and response, and the stimuli themselves are often responses to other stimuli.2 "The childish doctrine of instincts" is also valueless for prediction. Innate propensities are gen- eral, not specific. In general, in dealing with human behavior, whether consciousness is or is not taken as a datum, it is hard to lay hold of "objectively recognizable features in the situation which are uniformly associated with different possible eventualities." So far as the prediction and control of human behavior is at all possible, it is not by discovering and applying rules. The problem belongs 2. Further, it might be added, the stimulus is likely to be indeter- minate, in the sense that different persons (or one person at different times) will not always react to the same element m a total situation. 157</page><page sequence="4">158 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS to the field of art, of interpretation and suggestion, not to the field of science.3 So also with the study of history and of institutions. History gives judgment and insight, it does not give rules. "The useful knowledge of history is chiefly un- conscious knowledge." There are certain fields, Pro- fessor Knight admits, where statistical laws are possible. But it is difficult to get the facts; the method is appli- cable only to the "elemental" factors of life, and the behavior even of groups is unstable and unpredictable. Groups as well as individuals "grow in historical isolation."4 Is there, then, any room left for a science of eco- nomics? Professor Knight holds that there is. "In a limited field in economic data, due largely to the fact 3. I suspect that Professor Knight carries his skepticism on this point too far. Certain "principles" of advertising and of "salesman- ship" seem to have been developed. But doubtless the largest achieve- ments in either field will always demand a more sensitive and pliant knowledge of human nature than can be formulated in rules. Sir Frederick Pollock said of Machiavelli's influence, "no man ever learned the secret of despotism out of a book." It should be remembered, how- ever, that men's behavior (or, better, their conduct) can be modified by increasing their knowledge as well as by playing upon their weaknesses. Present-day proposals for "controlling human behavior" so as to mod- erate the cyclical fluctuations of business, rest on the assumption that men will make rational use of increased knowledge respecting the out- come of different types of business policies. In a similar way J. S. Mill and other Malthusians proposed to improve the economic status of wage-earners by acquainting them with the relation between the in- crease of the population and the movement of wages. Neo-Malthusians likewise put their trust in education, but assume, with reason, that knowledge that bears directly upon present personal interests is more likely to be used than knowledge that affects merely the remote interests of a class. 4. Such, it will be remembered, was the ground of Knies's denial of the possibility of "scientific" laws of economic life. I think that Pro- fessor Knight does less than justice to the possibilities of the statistical method. Practical difficulties are being surmounted, the range of sta- tistical information is being increased, technique is being perfected. Progress along these lines in the future promises to be more rapid than in the past. Furthermore, statistical groups are generally "isolated" only in part.</page><page sequence="5">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS that exchange has reduced the factors to definitely meas- urable quantities, we can have an exact science of the general form of relations." In a large sense "economiz- ing" covers about all of rational behavior. But through a division of labor among different sciences, "economic theory has in practice come to be restricted to the analy- sis of social interaction and coordination through the price mechanism.... It can tell us little in the concrete, and its chief function is negative - to offset as far as possible the stupid theorizing of the man in the street. The real sociology and economics must be branches of literature as well as of science." Professor Wolfe contributes a chapter on "Functional Economics." Under this forbidding title he writes about the place of science in economics and about a number of other things. Professor Wolfe is particularly opposed to the "pure science ideal," that is, that "eco- nomics is to be the virgin pursuit of knowledge for its own sake." There are, he holds, two other tenable ideals. First, research, while remaining objective, may be directed to problems that have a practical or ethical interest. Second, research may be "undertaken from ethical motives as well as from intellectual curiosity, and with some fundamental ethical norm or standard in mind." This second alternative is the one Professor Wolfe prefers. Economic research so motivated gives us "functional economics." It is not quite clear why he should worry about economists' motives, for he pro- fesses, on certain of his pages, to be an out-and-out determinist.5 5. "A scientific psychology must be deterministic .... Man's be- havior is as mechanical, in the last analysis, as that of any other part of nature." On the other hand, "someone is going to attempt the task of constructig a factually supported theory as a guide to rationally directed social or economic evolution, toward an organization more effectively serviceable to worthy human ends than the one we now have." Surely this is riding two horses at once. 159</page><page sequence="6">160 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Be that as it may, it is clear that the winds of prag- matism and instrumentalism have passed him by. "Pure science" is a logical fiction, altho it is reputed to have been pursued at the Academy of Laputa. Knowl- edge not related to some human interest is not knowl- edge. Never does an investigator seek merely what he may find, but always an answer to a question. Applied science differs from what is called pure science only in its lesser degree of generality, in the immediacy and particularity of its problems. It is a commonplace that in the history of the physical sciences the most fruitful and, in a sense, the most "practical" researches have been those which have been relatively free from the hampering specifications which immediate and particu- lar problems impose. In economics as in economic life it is likewise true that roundabout methods have often proved to be the most productive. The proper placing of ethics in its relation to eco- nomic inquiries is a matter of technique, not of princi- ple. An economic inquiry may be colored and shaped by an ethical interest, even when the inquiry is kept free of formal ethical postulates.6 Economics may be made to deal only with "what is," as distinct from "what ought to be"; and yet the particular report it makes, the precise aspects of "what is" to which it attends, may be determined by an interest in "what ought to be." But economics would lose rather than gain by an alliance with formal or "scientific" ethics. Professor Wolfe's "functional welfare economics" is to have as one of its fundamentals "a generally accepted, psychologically grounded, norm of welfare." This re- quirement is a heavy handicap. In fact, it puts "func- tional economics" pretty definitely out of the running. 6. This, I suppose, is substantially what Professor Wolfe has in mind as the second of the three possible ideals of economic science.</page><page sequence="7">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS Professor Bye, who writes of "Some Recent Develop- ments of Economic Theory," defends the position which Professor Wolfe attacks. He repeats the old arguments for "pure science," for a "purely descriptive econom- ics," and for its sharp separation from "applied eco- nomics." "Knowledge for knowledge's sake, without any intruding ideas about welfare, is the surest way toward the ultimate promotion of economic well- being." This position, I should say, involves a confu- sion. Science may perhaps be unbiased. But science can never be concerned with "pure description," for the reason that description is never "pure." Scientific as well as aesthetic description requires selection and valuation. Even bias, I suspect, is not without its uses, if only as an energizer, a catalytic agent. The general significance and the present status of the theory of value and distribution are the topics around which Professor Bye's discussion centers. If he says little that is new, he says much that is judicious. And if he fails to dig very deep, it is because he is excavating in the shallow debris of the dialectical controversies with which, during the past thirty years, too many American theorists have occupied themselves. I get the impression that, if he were to deal with substantive problems, involving more than merely verbal issues, Professor Bye could do work of a high order. Professor Clark has never done better work, I think, than in the first two sections of his paper on "The So- cializing of Theoretical Economics." In them there is a rare combination of felicitous expression and analyti- cal finesse. Professor Clark's conclusions are in some respects different from those of Professor Knight. But their contributions to this volume have one thing in common. They show that both authors have given 161</page><page sequence="8">QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS serious attention to modern developments of logical theory, and have woven some of those developments into their own thinking. Professor Clark's general view of economics is prag- matic. But he does not hold that the problems of eco- nomics are merely problems of "economic efficiency." Ethics might conceivably be ruled out, the notion of efficiency be kept distinct from any avowed notion of what is good, but only at the cost of introducing bias by including or emphasizing certain values rather than others. Selection appears not only in the choosing of prob- lems, but in picking the ways and means of attacking them. The materials and methods that satisfy the canons of scientific adequacy impose their own limita- tions upon us. "Yet," Professor Clark judiciously ob- serves, "it is probably impossible to invent a system of logic so tautologically sterile, or a behaviorism so aridly descriptive, as wholly to prevent the human mind from getting at the inner significance of facts." But if eco- nomic science is to make real progress, he contends, deduction and induction must be consciously used, so that each shall give significance and meaning to the other. Economic theprems that are universally true are mere truisms, tautologies. For example, "We are told that price is fixed at the point where supply and demand become equal." But, "It is only as common sense or induction adds descriptions of the behavior of 'supply' and 'demand' that the proposition has meaning at- tached to it, by a sort of associative process, and be- comes a vehicle or symbol of truths which its literal formulation does not categorically denote." In determining selection and emphasis, Professor Clark suggests, time and place are of primary impor- 162</page><page sequence="9">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS tance. A proposition about the existing economic order necessarily hinges upon the character of the substitutes for that order which are "within the bounds of serious possibility." Further, "it is probably true that eco- nomic conceptions have mostly been framed with reference to particular errors or evils which they might seem to combat." Smith's economics was directed against mercantilism. The theory of marginal produc- tivity was an answer both to Marx and to "wage-fund extremists." Thus far I can follow Professor Clark with confidence and with grateful approval. But I cannot follow him in his next step, in which those partial aspects of truth which are marshalled for practical or even for militant purposes are made to play the roles of opposites, in a kind of Hegelian dialectic. Competing economic the- orems are generally complementary, sometimes over- lapping, but never (unless there is positive error on one side or the other) opposites. Professor Clark's experiments in non-Euclidean eco- nomics are undeniably clever, but they do not convince me. He examines eight "eminently respectable propo- sitions," and manipulates them by processes which he lumps together under the name of "inversion" but which are really of several different types. Some of his theorems, in fact, are not "economic" propositions. Two writers, Professor Mills and Professor Weld, deal with the possibilities of inductive methods. Pro- fessor Mills's paper "On Measurement in Economics" is a workmanlike and finished production. He has read wisely and considered carefully. Nevertheless, I be- lieve, some of his principal conclusions are untenable. That he should have made some slips is not surprising, for he traverses ground where the footing is treacherous. 163</page><page sequence="10">164 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The present status of the logic of statistics is admittedly unsatisfactory, and there is room for differences of opinion on fundamental matters. Professor Mills starts with certain considerations suggested by Merz's chapter7 on "The Statistical View of Nature," and by Josiah Royce's notable paper on "The Mechanical, the Historical, and the Statisti- cal." 8 He is led to generalize respecting the "statistical character of useful knowledge." The difficulty with "the mechanical conception," Professor Mills holds, is that it "involves the notion of sameness, of the precise identity of all the things or events described by a given law." This is a rash generalization.9 But taking it as 7. J. T. Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century, vol. ii, ch. xii. 8. Science, new series, vol. xxxix, p 551. "The object of statistical knowledge is not the single [historical] event and is not the invariant [mechanical] law, but is the relatively uniform behavior of some average constitution, belonging to an aggregate of things and events, and the probablity that this average behavior will remain, within limits, ap- proxlmately, altho always imperfectly uniform." The statistical view, Royce held, is not a mere makeshift substitute for the mechanical view. He argued that since verification is always inexact, an approximate theory is better than an exact one. "There is good reason to say that the statistical force is the canonical form of scientific theory." Of course this is nothing more than interesting conjecture. The difficulty is that statistical knowledge, for aught we know to the contrary, might be re- solved into the mechanical form, while important types of mechanical knowledge appear to resist statistical formulation. This particular range of problems has never been more ably discussed than by Cournot, espe- cially in his Essai sur les Fondements de nos Connaissances, altho his conclusion that the world itself, lke our knowledge of it, is both me- chanical and statistical, has never gained a following. Cournot's dis- tinction between historical and scientific knowledge was essentially like the one drawn by a number of modern logicians, notably H. Rickert. Royce's view was less fully developed. Professor Mills, it may be observed, follows Maxwell rather than Royce when he asserts that "mechanical laws assume the historical type of knowledge." He appears to mean that mechamcal knowledge assumes complete induction-surely not a tenable position. 9. What the mechamcal view really assumes is that the relatzons of quantztatwze aspects of things are stable, in the sense that their variations may be described by mathematical functions. There are, of course, other necessary assumptions, but only such, I believe, as are equally required by the statistical view.</page><page sequence="11">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS it is, what of it? Neither the physical scientist, qua scientist, nor the economist, qua economist, is concerned with the ultimate constitution of knowledge. The prac- tical problem is one of getting useful and reliable ways of formulating and organizing knowledge. Will anyone maintain that the necessary assumptions of non-statis- tical physical science fail to get abundant justification from its achievements? 1 So too with the concept of law. "A law as the scientist sees it," observes Professor Mills, "does not govern." No, but the notion that it does govern served a very useful purpose in its day. Professor Mills follows Marshall (and J. S. Mill) in holding that an economic law is a statement of a "tendency." 2 Now the notion of a "tendency" in phenomena is quite as animistic as the notion that "law governs." But I should not reject it on that account. It is a convenient way of indicating with a minimum of circumlocution that a law is a gen- eral statement that has prediction value. I cannot, however, follow Professor Mills in holding, with Royce, that "tendency is an essentially statistical term," "a statement of average relations." That a projectile tends to follow a path defined by a curve fitted by least squares to the observed paths of different sorts of projectiles, selected at random and discharged under haphazard conditions, is not a useful statement. 1. Professor Mills urges that the data of economics are more un- certain than those of the physical sciences. But this puts additional difficulties in the way of the empirical as well as of the rational formu- lation of tendencies. 2. Incidentally, I do not understand just why Professor Mills holds that of the two graphs he prints (on pages 52 and 53) one illustrates physical and the other economic "law." Both show relationships of physical variables. In a rigid sense both are illustrations of diminishing returns. The only drfference I have been able to discover is that the second "law" has more economic significance than the other, and that in its case the observed facts are not summarized so well by a smooth curve. 165</page><page sequence="12">166 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS That a projectile tends to follow a path determined by accurate observations of the behavior of similar pro- jectiles, discharged under generally similar conditions is, on the other hand, a useful statement which serves as a practical rule in gunnery. That a projectile tends to follow a path defined by a parabola is also a practi- cally useful statement. That the prices of agricultural products tend to in- crease as population grows is, under present conditions, a rational (mechanical) rather than an empirical state- ment. It is in no proper sense an 'average." That wages tend to lag behind advancing prices is, let us say, an inference based in large part upon an induction, but it .is vastly more than an "average." A statement of historical fact is not a statement of tendency. An average, as well as a single event, may be unique.3 In the field of mechanics, which Professor Mills cites by way of analogy, the real cleavage is not between rational mechanics and statistical mechanics, but be- tween rational mechanics and empirical mechanics.4 But rational mechanics is merely a way of organizing 3. The larger the purely "statistical" element, the more, that is, an average enters into a process purely as a statistical average, rather than as a device for adjusting observations of a fixed but unknown magmtude, the greater is the uncertainty of prediction. This distinction is not merely verbal. To say that a statistical mquiry can be brought under the general theory of errors of observation is to say, in effect, that it supplements (and is supplemented by) a large body of relevant ex- perience, orgamzed in rational or mechamcal form. The same principles are involved, altho somewhat more loosely, in our habit of approving statistical findmngs that appear to be "reasonable" In practice it is generally some such joinng of statistical and rational considerations that makes it possible to get workable results out of what appear on the surface to be weak or meaningless a posteriori probablhties. Urn schemata are inadequate representations of the umverse of experience, orgamzed and unorganized, withi which the statistician works. 4. The kinetic theory of gases, as developed by Maxwell, Boltzman, and Gibbs, is the canonical example of "statistical" mechanics. The method is a priori, not empirical, and serves as a means of explatinng experience, not of summarizing or describing it. Conceivably, making reasonable suppositions with respect to the position and movement of each molecule, the whole mechanism could be explained by a system of</page><page sequence="13">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS 167 experience, while empirical mechanics is fairly sure to be rationalized whenever that process is economical. Experience and theory go hand in hand, or rather, by their aid science climbs upward hand over hand. In economics, likewise, inductive findings will give accu- racy and concrete meaning to the theorems of rational 5 economics, while theory will continue to analyze, in- terpret, relate, and support the results of inductive studies and of such other new experience as comes to its hand. Professor Mills, it is proper to say, really grants as much. But the tone and emphasis of his thoughtful study are otherwise. The growing use of quantitative methods is the most promising development in con- temporary economics. But it will prove relatively sterile if it does not lead to a renaissance of theory. Professor Weld's chapter on "Regional Comparison and Economic Progress" does not call for extended com- ment. It is an unsatisfactorypiece of work. Theyounger economists, unlike their teachers, Professor Weld tells equations. Millions of equations would be necessary, so that approach is cut off. But the number of molecules is so large, that it makes no practical difference whether they be considered as bound by law or free. In either case the fundamental assumptions are Newtonian. Gibbs him- self never suggested that his formulas gave a clue to the nature of knowledge. He was content that they gave results that "coincide sensi- bly with the general laws of thermodynamics." Similarly the theorem that entropy (useless energy - playing a part in mechanics curiously like that of utlity in some systems of economics) tends toward a maxi- mum, may be formulated as a statement of a tendency toward change from a less probable to a more probable state. Here again statistical mechanics affords merely an alternative form of explanation. It gives no hint reputing the nature of reality or even of the constitution of the data of experience. (For a good elementary account of these matters see Enmle Borel, Le Hasard, chs. vi and x.) On the opposite margin of the science of mechanics, remote from these bold generalizations, we find empirical formulas, "statistical" in the sense that they involve averages, which have not been reduced to rational rules. Here again economy is the controlling consideration. The "uncertainty" of sta- tistical mechanics is not the uncertainty of empirical formulas. Royce confused two different thmgs. 5. I trust that it is still possible to use this adjective with a logical rather than a psychological implcation.</page><page sequence="14">168 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS us, are interested in welfare. To this end "we must learn of causes or else shut up shop." Knowledge of causes may be derived from regional comparisons, so as to "make it more possible for backward nations to be brought into better alignment with modern progress." Professor Weld suggests how it might be done. The obvious comment is that one concrete achievement in this field of research, no matter how small, is worth any amount of schematizing. Professor Weld's scheme, after all, is merely that the researches he proposes should be guided by Mill's canons of experimental inquiry. It is surprising that Professor Weld should have failed to note Mill's empha- sis upon the difference between sciences of mere obser- vation and sciences of experimentation. It is even more surprising that he should not have noted that Mill de- voted a chapter to the task of showing that his canons of experimental research could not safely be used in regional economic comparisons.6 The title of Professor Tugwell's paper, "Experi- mental Economics," suggests that he too is writing of inductive methods. It suggests also that he too con- founds induction and experimentation. Happily, the paper belies its title. One's judgment of its quality must depend largely upon the type (as distinct from the severity) of the standards by which one rates it. 6. Mill undoubtedly went too far in his skepticism. In the eighth edition of his Logic he appended to his general discussion of plural causes (Book iii, ch. x) a note which begins as follows: "It is justly remarked by Professor Bar, that though the Methods of Agreement and Difference are not applicable to these cases, they are not wholly inac- cessible to the Method of Concomitant Variations." But he made no change in his chapter on the use of mductive methods m the social sciences (Book vi, ch. vii). Not only did Mill write when statistical technique was relatively undeveloped, but it is clear that he had particularly m mind a special problem (the effects different commercial policies have on national prosperity) where the nations that might be compared are few and the effects to be detected ill-defined and relatively slght.</page><page sequence="15">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS It is plentifully besprinkled with the various tags of "modernism." Dogmatic opinions are thrown around recklessly. There is no evidence of any effort to achieve logical consistency.7 Yet what Professor Tugwell has to say is not to be dismissed lightly. Impressionistic as it is, his paper has a distinctly interesting intellectual background. It has also a certain eager and buoyant quality. And it is better to throw logic to the winds than mess around with it blunderingly. To adapt a phrase from Professor Knight, the field of economic criticism has room for literature as well as for logic. A paper made up of appreciations (and deprecia- tions), with aesthetic rather than logical unity, cannot be summarized in a few paragraphs. But the picture Professor Tugwell paints is, in outline, one of a world confronted by momentous new problems, handicapped by an economics that is rigid and inflexible because the notion of natural law permeates it through and through. "Economic laws (as now formulated) are not natural laws just because they are not useful in the sense that natural laws are useful." 8 We need, therefore, a more flexible, experimental, approach to economic problems. Not only what cannot be but what might be should en- gage our active interests. We need, in effect, a larger use of the planning and creative imagination. But along with that we need to verify and reject. Social 7. I select only one example. Professor Tugwell holds that eco- nomics has suffered because its development has largely been at the hands of teachers whose task is "to communicate to students the accum- ulations of scientific knowledge that society has been able to build up." Unfortunately for this generalization certain important exceptions would occur to any one So, according to Professor Tugwell, Ricardo, Marx, and the Mills, altho "they had no formal Umnversity connections, were nevertheless pedagogues " From which I infer only that Professor Tugwell does not like their doctrines. 8. Professor Tugwell cites the law of diminishmg returns. Does he mean that the "experimental" economist could safely disregard that law? If it cannot safely be disregarded it is, for that reason, useful. Or does he merely mean that it does not bear upon problems in which he happens to be interested? 169</page><page sequence="16">170 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS experimentation is costly. " If we can somehow simulate experience as the chemist simulates in his laboratory, we shall have made a big advance in social method." 9 I should accept this in part, not so much as an ac- count of what we ought to do, but as a fairly accurate account of the actual processes of constructive thought. But I do not like Professor Tugwell's mplications that experimental thinking affords in some way a new oppor- tunity for economists, that past generations of econo- mists had minds that were differently constructed, and that the notion of economic law has always been the peculiar property of the standpatter, never of the man who looks forward.1 While he grants freedom of experi- mental thinking to himself and to his contemporaries, he assumes that the older economists were bound fast by tradition, by a superstitious faith in economic law, and even by the play of economic determinism.2 I do 9. The chemist does not "simulate" experience; he creates it. And whether in our own thinking we can "somehow simulate experience" is an idle question; for somehow we do. Professor Tugwell quotes John Dewey on "the place of active and planning thought within the very processes of experience," but seems not to have caught the full bearing of the words. For an iluminating statement of what I take to be the sound core of Professor Tugwells thesis see Willam James, Some Problems of Philosophy, p. 222. 1. I shall not name American economists. But I wish that Professor Tugwell and those who hold with him would read and reflect upon Mill's autobiography and J. M. Keynes's memoir on Alfred Marshall. Presumably Professor Tugwell, like Professor Mitchell, finds Mill and Marshall dull. But surely it requires only a modicum of sympathetic intelligence to allow for the inevitable shifting of interests that comes as new problems emerge and as some of te old ones, perhaps, approach a final solution. 2. Thus, "Professor J. M. Clark's whole approach to the field of economic theory has been ethical." But, "Adam Smith's connection with the commercial life of Glasgow bore directly upon his conception of national welfare." Professor Fsher and Professor Mitchell are inter- ested in cures for the evils of the business cycle and of unstable prices, and their theories, therefore, are "ethically oriented." Ricardo had similar interests. But presumably these, like certain of his theories which Professor Tugwell mentions, were "directly influenced by the fact that he was a city man and a stockbroker."</page><page sequence="17">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS not see how one who looks backward through smoked glasses can look forward with open and clear eyes. Professor Slichter is quite as dissatisfied with the present status of economic theory as Professor Tugwell is, and the problems with which he thinks theory should occupy itself are like some that Professor Tugwell recom- mends. But otherwise their papers are radically differ- ent. Professor Slichter brings to his discussion of "The Organization and Control of Economic Activity" an extraordinarily concrete and particularizing turn of mind. He is impatient of broad generalizations. His interest is in pointing to the looseness with which such generalizations fit the facts of experience.3 But this implies, of course, another generalization, negative in form. Thus his principal thesis is that competition is not effective as a regulator of economic activity. More specifically, "an interest on the part of individual buy- ers and sellers in discriminating against those who dis- regard the common welfare is lacking, not in a few scattered instances, but in many." "Furthermore, even when individuals do have an interest in discriminating, they frequently lack the information, the time, the will- ingness, the intelligence, or the bargaining power to do so." 3. Professor Slichter's own generalizations are not always successful. Iis thesis that aggregate wages may be decreased by increasing the num- ber of laborers calls for some highly improbable assumptions. His con- tention that the scrapping of obsolete equipment has the net effect of "enforcing" a higher rate of saving is, to say the least, unproved. His further suggestion that the paying off of debts increases social capital neglects all but the most superficial aspects of the processes of capital accumulation. The fact that few industries ordinarily produce at their peak capacity does not lead, as he supposes, to the conclusion that "chronic underproduction is an inherent characteristic of free enter- pnse" Such a conclusion would be a just inference from a state of chronic unemployment, but not from a state of chromc overequipment. Slips like these suggest that the "extremely general and highly simpli- fied" type of theory to which Professor Slichter objects may not alto- gether have outlined its usefulness. 171</page><page sequence="18">172 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS I know of no more effective brief for the prosecution than the one Professor Slichter submits. At only a few points does he put new counts into the indictment; but his method gives fresh meaning to the old ones. He does not argue his case, he merely marshals his evidence in such a way that it has a cumulative effect. I venture to say that no one can read his paper without having his own thinking affected. If that be true, Professor Slichter has made a substantial contribution to eco- nomics. 4 I have tried to get the precise drift of Professor Cope- land's discussion of " Communities of Economic Interest 4. Professor Slichter intends that his paper should be taken primarily as a criticism of the theory of value and of the central position that theory occupies in economic thought. "Quite clearly, the question of how value works is quite as much a part of the value problem as is the question of how it is determined." I should go quite as far, and even a little farther, for I do not beleve that the two questions can be sepa- rated. This is a convement place at which to observe that not only Professor Slichter, but a number of his fellow contributors, as well, appear to identify not only "economic theory," but "economics" with certain particularly thin and abstract formulations of the general theory of value and distribution. I infer even that when the "economic sys- tems" of earlier writers are mentioned, only their theories of value and dcstribution are meant. Economics is condemned for its neglect of everything but general theories of value and distribution, when m some cases, it appears, the critics are closing their eyes to everything else. For example, Professor Slichter forgets that not only in Alfred Marshall's work, but in the work of many American economists, there is much that can be described by what Marshall said in the preface to his National Industry and Trade: "The present volume is occupied in the main with the influences which still make for sectional and class selfishness; with the limited tendencies of self-interest to direct each individual's action on those hnes in which it will be most beneficial to others." This sunder- ing of a certain part of the structure of economics from its relations is probably in part a consequence of the unnatural separation of "pure theory" and "problems" that has prevailed in the curricula of American umversities. A striking illustration of what I have in mmd is at hand. A reader of this volume, with no previous knowledge of the subject, could not infer either from the individual papers or the bibliography (which, by the way, is not a credit to American scholarshlp) that econ- omists are ever concerned with problems of international trade. And yet it is clearly impossible to understand the general structure of eco- nomic doctrine without understanding how large a part problems of international trade played m shapig it.</page><page sequence="19">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS and the Price System," but must confess failure. How- ever, Professor Copeland is fond of such words as pe- cuniary, technological, profitivity, anthropomorphic, and the like, so that his interests and the influences which have helped to shape them are fairly clear. Yet it must be said that Professor Copeland is more temper- ate than some of his collaborators in his treatment of economists in general, and that he has evidently en- deavored to work his way through to honest conclusions. And I get the impression that these conclusions, if they could be divested of their uncouth terminology, would invite thoughtful consideration. There remain to be considered 5 the papers of Pro- fessor Mitchell, on "The Prospects of Economics," and of Professor Douglas, on "The Reality of Non- Commercial Incentives in Economic Life." Professor Mitchell's contribution is accorded the place of honor in the makeup of the volume-a circumstance which helps to attract attention to the way in which some of the papers which follow (in general, the more dissentient ones) unmistakably reflect Professor Mitchell's influ- ence. At some points, however, Professor Mitchell him- self seems to have departed from his earlier views. No economist of his generation has made more im- portant substantive additions to economic knowledge 5. To keep this review within bounds, I have to forego any extended consideration of the chapters contributed by Dr. Hale and Mr. Soule. Dr. Hale, writmg on "Economic Theory and the Statesman," reviews the present status of the problem of regulating railroads and public util- ities, and inqures mto the adequacy of those portions of economic theory which have a bearing upon that problem. I should agree with his con- clusion that economic theory, in its present form, does not afford the light the problem needs. Such specific proposals as Dr. Hale makes, however, are for changes in the basis of publc polcy, not in economic theory. Mr. Soule's views, presented in a short paper on "Economics, Science, and Art," are in some respects much like those of Professor Tugwell, and at other pomts are substantially lke those of Professor Mitchell. 173</page><page sequence="20">174 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS than Professor Mitchell. He has shown how fruitful quantitative methods may be, when guided and supple- mented by skillful analysis. He has given new meaning and significance to various short-time fluctuations and maladjustments in our exchange economy. This sub- stantive work of his fits into and amplifies the general structure of economic knowledge that has been built up slowly and falteringly during the last century and a half. The assumptions, the modes of thought, are such as are familiar to economists. What is new is the body of concrete experience which Professor Mitchell has patiently and deftly organized and formulated in terms of general tendencies. It is strange, therefore, that in various other writings Professor Mitchell should have done his best to destroy confidence in the soundness of the general structure of which the best of his own work seems to be an integral part. His attacks have been directed, not at the super- structure, but at its supposed foundations. His locus standi was supplied by Thorstein Veblen's thesis that the character of economic science has been determined by its preconceptions. "The main canons of truth on which the science proceeded were: (a) a hedonistic- associational psychology, and (b) an uncritical convic- tion that there is a meliorative trend in the course of events, apart from the conscious ends of the individual numbers of the community." 6 Veblen made no attempt 6. Thorstein Veblen, "The Preconceptions of Economic Science," Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. xiv, p. 242. Reprinted in The Place of Science in Moder Civilization and Other Essays, p. 150. I am dealing in the text, above, with Professor Mitchell's development of the first "canon." Veblen's statement respecting the second has had an equally pervasive influence. In fact, several of the contributors to The Trend of Economics appear to take it as a text. So far as English eco- nomics after Adam Smith is concerned, it rests only upon Veblen's adroit fumbling of the distmctlon between normative (mehorative) trends and specific tendencies. Veblen was able to maintain a semblance of logical consistency only by consigning practically all of physical</page><page sequence="21">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS to prove or even to illustrate his thesis respecting the first "canon." It was and has remained merely a bland assertion. That economic science proceeded on the basis of a hedonistic-associational (or any other) psychology can be proved or disproved in only two ways, one analytical, the other empirical. I shall refer to the bearing analysis has upon the matter when I come to discuss Professor Mitchell's present position. A fair empirical test might be arranged as follows. Take Hume's economic essays, Ricardo's Principles or James Mill's Elements of Politi- cal Economy, and some important modern work, say the analytical portion of Professor Mitchell's Business Cycles. Revise them so that neither archaisms and turns of phrasing or references to specific problems or events shall date them. Refer them to a competent psychologist, unversed in the history of economic thought or in general economic history. The psycholo- gist is to determine solely on the basis of the psycho- logical preconceptions the different documents reveal: (1) on what system or systems of psychology each writer bases his reasoning, (2) which wrote before and which after Bentham, (3) which wrote before and which after the "decay" of associationism and utilitarianism. science, except descriptive genetics (not, strictly speaking, a science) to the limbo of outmoded superstitions. On any ground the thesis is un- tenable. Even Smith's "system of natural lberty" could be achieved only by conscious effect. By general consent Ricardo's view of the general trend of affairs was pessimistic. Mill's famous thesis that "the distribution of wealth is a matter of human institution only" might conceivably be ruled out, as something apart from the main body of his doctrines. Consider, therefore, the concluding sentence in his discussion of the stationary state. "Only when, in addition to just institutions, the increase of mankind shall be under the deliberate guidance of judicious foresight, can the conquests made from the powers of nature by the intellect and energy of scientific discoverers become the common prop- erty of the species, and the means of improving and elevating the uni- versal lot." It is a pity that it should be necessary to take space m this journal to call attention to such obvious and supposedly familiar thmgs. 175</page><page sequence="22">176 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS In fact, a laboratory test is hardly necessary. Any stu- dent may satisfy himself by an exercise in "experi- mental thinking." My own opinion is that the psychol- ogist would be able to put his finger on no general psychological preconceptions.7 In 1910 Professor Mitchell gave hostages to fortune in the form of an extended and favorable review of Professor William McDougall's Social Psychology.8 Pro- fessor McDougall's allegation that political economy rested on hedonistic postulates, and his suggestion that a classification of general instinctive propensities would afford a better basis, gave support, of course, to Veblen's thesis. Professor Mitchell restated and amplified that thesis. "Economic theory," he said, "rests and always has rested, upon the concept of human nature posited by the theorist." "It is clearly unwise for them to con- tinue trusting and using the traditional hedonistic psy- chology." One of the major problems before economists, he alleged, was to trace "the processes by which habits and institutions have grown out of instincts." But by 1914 it became clear that economists might have wasted their time if they had set seriously at work to reconstruct their science on foundations more or less like those proffered by Professor McDougall. Instincts had multiplied under Professor Thorndike's scrutiny, Graham Wallas had put his trust in "complex dispo- sitions," Walter Lippman had clothed some social theory in Freudian garments, Veblen's "instinct of workmanship" had turned out not to be an ins;incr, and a new thing, behaviorism, had made its appearance. 7. I suspect, however, that he might be able to put all of the docu- ments somewhere in the general stream of the English empirical tradi- tion. Veblen's own work, with its picture of systems of thought built up by the unfolding and the synthesis of preconceptions, would be more lkely to be set down as Hegeliamsm dressed in a modern patozs. 8 "The Rationality of Economic Activity," Journal of Political Economy, vol. xviii, pp. 97, 197 (February, March 1910).</page><page sequence="23">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS 177 Most of all, a number of economists had argued that economics does not require psychological postulates.9 Nevertheless, Professor Mitchell stuck by some of his guns, and brought up new ones.l "It is possible that the effort to keep the study of human nature out of eco- nomic theory may break down.... It may be that econ- omists will find themselves not only borrowing from but contributing to psychology. For if that science is ever to give a competent account of human behavior it seems necessary that economists should do a part of the work." But he still insisted that hedonism had "exer- cised a potent influence upon economics." In the paper now before us, Professor Mitchell again appears to alter his position,2 and, in my opinion, for the better. I quote a significant passage: Economics is necessarily one of the sciences of human behavior. Whether its votaries recognize the fact or not, it endeavors to show how men deal with each other in getting their livings. Now no man can possibly give an account of economic behavior without having some working motives of human nature on the back of his tongue. No one can lay down any proposition about business transactions with- out implying 3 that men have different standard ways of feeling, thinking, and acting in their market dealings with each other. It is therefore naive to talk of divorcing psychology from economics.... It is equally naive to talk as if the economist borrowed or could 9. A list is given by Professor Mitchell in the paper cited below. I venture to add a reference to my remarks about Jevons's hedonism, in the American Economic Review, vol. ii, p. 582 (September 1912). 1. "Human Behavior and Economics: A Survey of Recent Litera- ture," Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. xxxix, p. 1 (November 1914). 2. Nevertheless Professor Mitchell deems it proper to say: "Our orthodox economists have a most madequate conception of psychology - and economics also for that matter." 3. To infer psychological generalizations from generalizations about business transactions is, of course, not the same as deducing generaliza- tions about business transactions from generalzatlons about "the original nature of man." And as a matter of fact I can generalze about some aspects of the behavior of one of Professor Mitchell's price series, without inferring, implying, or learning anything about the "nature of man."</page><page sequence="24">QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS borrow all his psychological notions from the psychologists. For if economics deals with economic behavior, then it must go beyond the contributions which professed psychologists make to the general science of behavior. The economist will learn more in his own field of course if he begins tilling it with sound psychological conceptions to help him; but the soundest general conceptions of "the original nature of man" and its modifications in the course of experience will be merely a starting point for his own researches into human behavior. The psychologists and their contributions to econom- ics are receding into the background. It might even be inferred that the (behavioristic) psychologists have more to learn from economics than the economists have to learn from psychology. One further step, I think, Professor Mitchell will ultimately be compelled to take. The truth is that economics not only should be or is, but always has been a study of human behavior,4 getting its data from experience, not from psychological postu- lates. Professor Mitchell's explanation of the general struc- ture of Ricardian economics, now runs, like Professor Edwin Cannan's, in terms of the special problems of the post-Napoleonic period. But this new instrumental ex- planation is supplemented bya renewed insistence on the importance of a priori psychological elements in Ricar- dian economics. These elements, however, are no longer lumped together as "hedonism" or "associationism," We are now told that Ricardo's conclusions "rest on the broad assumptions concerning economic behavior which a thoughtful financier had found dependable." Among these assumptions are the restless desire of capitalists for profits, modified by an aversion to certain trades, 4. Compare the judicious findings of Professor Z. C. Dickinson, in his Economic Motives. I should agree with Professor Dickmson that there may be special aspects or corners of economic activity upon which the researches of the psychologist may throw important lght. On the other hand, there are important and necessary elements in economics which are not to be subsumed under "human behavior." 178</page><page sequence="25">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS the habits and Malthusian instincts of the laborers, and the Olympian passivity of landlords. (In Professor Mitchell's 1910 papers his general allegation respect- ing hedonism was supplemented by somewhat similar specifications.) Now this is vastly better than tossing off Ricardo as a hedonist, but it is not enough. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to deduce Ricar- do's system from psychological postulates, unless the postulates are made so numerous that there is a one-to- one correspondence with every separate element in his system.5 In short, Ricardo's postulates are found only in his system; in fact, I believe it substantially accurate to say that they are his system. Professor Mitchell has charged economists with having rationalized economic behavior. He himself, following, I admit, a goodly number of precedents, has rationalized economic science. For exposition's sake, or because they thought logical consistency required it, or for some much more subtle and obscure reason, economic theorists have often pre- sented their doctrines as though they flowed from some first principle. But the first principle is generally purely ornamental,6 like the meaningless "desire for wealth." The real soundness of a system of thought depends upon its internal consistency and upon the accuracy with which it summarizes the pertinent parts of experi- ence. These considerations hold true not only for so- called deductive economics (the "deduction" is only a 5. I cannot define an "element" except as that which would in strict logic demand a separate postulate. There are scores of such elements in Ricardo's economics. 6. When Professor Fetter substituted "choice" for utility as a first principle, the change not only did not but could not, of itself, effect Professor Fetter's practical conclusions. Similarly, it is obvious that we could "base" Professor Mitchell's explanation of busmess cycles upon an explicit hedonism without altering his findings. The utilty of fictional first principles is expounded in Vaihinger's philosophy of the "as if" (lucidly summarized by Havelock Elhs, in The Dance of Life, ch. iii). 179</page><page sequence="26">180 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS matter of expositional form7) but also for "institu- tional" or any other variety of economics. Imagine a scholar from Mars, equipped with (1) a sufficient knowledge of our physical environment and its behavior, (2) a sufficient knowledge of the institu- tional relations (not behavior) of men, and (3) a "post- ulate," such as, say, that men behave as good hedonists should. Require him to formulate a political economy, and he would be helpless. Tell him then "men desire wealth," and he would reply, "But you have told me that wealth is whatever men desire that is not to be had freely." Give him Professor Mitchell's revised Ricar- dian postulates, and he would, for practical purposes, be equally helpless. But give him Ricardo's general fund of human experience, including his knowledge of the way men behave in their business relations and of the way prices, rents, and other things behave, give him also Ricardo's knowledge of what Smith, Malthus, West, and others had said, give him Ricardo's interest in the problems of his day, give him finally Ricardo's power of generalization, and he could write Ricardo's Principles. One cannot tell just how many "postulates" deduc- tive economics requires. Nor would there be any prac- tical purpose in trying to find out. The postulates change and grow as experience grows and as experience is better formulated. A very considerable part of our postulates can never be found anywhere else than in that direct and subtle kind of knowledge we call "com- mon sense."8 7. "The distinction between theory and practice we owe, indeed, like many another distinction, to the Greeks, but the divorce is our own contrivance. Accordingly, a theoretical knowledge of human, as of animal, behavior would mean to them the sort of knowledge that corre- sponds to the facts, and enabling one to deal with the facts m a practical way." Lane Cooper, The Greek Genius and Its Influence, p. 10. 8. Even in pure geometry, the task of accurately determining the necessary postulates and fixing their minimum number has been difficult. And m general the task of puttig "rigor" (strict deductive form) into</page><page sequence="27">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS Even a fuller knowledge of "economic motives" does not help much, for " motives " are merely abstract names for general classes of behavior. I do not feel that Pro- fessor Douglas's interesting discussion of non-commer- cial incentives substantially increases our stock of useful knowledge. Professor Douglas had his rubrics ready- made. He looked for apt and interesting illustrations and found them. To be considered, also, is the notorious unreliability of the data available for such a study.9 Nevertheless, studies like Professor Douglas's un- doubtedly help to give a concrete content to our general notions. The "economic man" was a fiction, not of economics, but of the sterile formal logic of economic method, for much of which, of course, economists themselves have been responsible. What the economists really ab- stracted was one special class of human relationships. Or better, they took into account the world as they knew it, modified only in that their eyes were focussed on the impersonal types of relationships that are to be found in the market places of countries where modern commercial institutions have been developed. They did not rationalize human behavior; they merely put into generalized form 1 their knowledge of some very real pure mathematics has always lagged considerably behind the growth of mathematical knowledge In mechanics (a much simpler subject than economics) a rigidly deductive form is impossible. Not only inductive facts but common sense must be drawn upon. "Common sense, or better perhaps, good sense, comes close to being that esprit de finesse which Pascal, in a famous passage, contrasted with l'esprzt gmometrque." L6on Lecornu, La Mecanique, p. 1. 9. For example I do not doubt that Mr. Ford is perfectly sincere in saying that he has been motivated by "the ideal of service." But no one is a relable judge of one's own purposes. 1. The processes of constructive thought are, of course, exceedigly obscure. We know that induction and deduction are terms properly applicable to forms of exposition and verification, not to thnkmng. I hazard a guess that m the actual construction of economic science analo- gies and "models" have had much to do with the form generalzations 181</page><page sequence="28">182 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS types of behavior. Their knowledge was incomplete, their generalizations were often too loose or too rigid, they failed to take account of all the available experi- ence that was important for their purposes. But their method was not at fault, for, outside of the field where controlled experiments are possible, it is the only method science knows. A better knowledge of general psychology might have helped them here and there. It could not substantially have changed their postulates. Professor Mitchell might conceivably say to all of this that he would consign the whole theory of value and distribution to the scrap heap, and that he would pin his faith to what he describes as "an unorthodox type of economic theory - a type of theory that deals with a range of problems undreamt of in the philosophy of value and distribution." This is "institutional eco- nomics." Its older forms, for one reason or another, were defective. "But by the eighteen nineties, Sidney Webb in England, Werner Sombart in Germany, and Thorstein Veblen in America were studying the evolu- tion of economic institutions in a scientific, as opposed to an historical or a propagandist, spirit. Further, they were claiming that work of this kind is economic theory." Let us take Veblen's work as a type. Sombart's work, I grant, is much like his. Sidney Webb's is sub- stantially different. Without raising now the old ques- have taken. Thus our generalizations relating to diminishing and margi- nal utility are not "deductions" from any psychological postulates, but would appear to be organizations of our knowledge of a larger field of economic behavior upon the analogy of or after the model of generaliza- tions already successfully established with respect to the behavior of the market place. This hypothesis would help to explain the fact that the notion of marginal utility served in its turn as the model upon which some able Austrian psychologists organized a yet wider body of experi- ence into an interestig type of psychology. Thus instead of an eco- nomic theory based on hedonistic postulates, a psychology was modelled (not based) upon economic theory.</page><page sequence="29">THE TREND OF ECONOMICS 183 tion of the possibility of getting verifiable historical "laws," glance at the general character of Veblen's work. He is a man of genius, but the term scientist does not fit him. He is something that may be as good or better: an artist, an impressionist, painting the picture of the world as he sees it. No one else would see it in just the same way, except through his eyes.2 In modern stagecraft a slight difference in lighting changes the whole scene. So it is with institutional economics. ALLYN A.
