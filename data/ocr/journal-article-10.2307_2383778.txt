<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity Encounters 7apan. Bv Joseph J. Spae. Oriens Institute for Religious Research, Tokyo, I968. 290 pages, $6.oo, Y2,0o0. IN a previous book called Christian Cor- ridors to 7apan, the author began what he termed an investigation of those con- ditions which would be necessary for a fruitful encounter of Christianity with Japan. The present work pursues the subject further, approaching it from the three aspects of sociology, psychology, and theology, in that order. For each of these three, a good deal of the material consists of data provided by question- naires, surveys, the findings and opinions of others; most of the remainder of the material could best be described as the author's running commentary on the data-interpreting, questioning, agree- ing, qualifying. In the first two parts of the work this commentary hangs some- what in the background, but the author's theological experience quite understand- ably brings that commentary to the fore- front when he takes up the theological aspect. The purpose of this book is, proximate-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 203 ly, to scrutinize the Japanese people from the three above-mentioned aspects and, ultimately, to discover some points of contact, some common ground, where Christianity can effect its entry into Japanese society and the Japanese psyche. What is needed, the author rightly ob- serves (p. i5), is a methodology. But he then identifies such a methodological approach as part of what he terms the sociology of religion (pp. i5, i6), a science which in his opinion suffers from a lack of metaphysics and theology (pp. I7 ,i8). With these as his working assumptions he proceeds to the task set for himself, delineating in Part I some areas for deeper research in sociology, sounding out in Part II Japanese attitudes toward Christi- anity, and elaborating on several fruitful theological questions in his longest sec- tion, Part III, which forms the core and climax of the book. The basic problem, however, must be solved by something more fundamental than either metaphysics or theology; further, the answer lies not in the area of sociology but in that of psychology; fiurther yet, this answer will not be dis- covered by taking as a premise and draw- ing conclusions from the so-called 'Japa- nese ways of thinking', nor even by assembling and analyzing surveys which present 'Japanese impressions of Christi- anity' (pp. 72 ff). Since the end ultimate- ly aimed at, if reduced to its bare bones, is the efficient and scientifically controlled transmission, from one group of humans to another, of a certain message which in addition to cognitional content entails also volitional response, behavior habits, and a way of life-in short, which makes demands on the whole man-search for common ground, for points of contact, must begin with the structure of human activity; rather than analysis of religious practices, of opinions, of statements, of difficulties encountered so far, what is needed is attention to the human cogni- tional and volitional activity involved in communication and reception, under- standing and acceptance, misunderstand- ing and rejection. The fundamental struc- ture of human activity, as comprised in the three cognitional levels of experience, understanding, and reflection and the volitional level of decision, enable the researcher to dip beneath the surface differences in mentalities; a clear grasp of how the structure is operative in man (no matter what his nationality or cultural background) will make possible a clear grasp of what faith is, what leads to it, how it differs from religion, how it and religion differ from theology; a clear grasp of what happens when the dynam- ism of this operation is thwarted or abused leads to an understanding of such phen- omena as bias, differences of opinions, anthropomorphic projection, subjective projection, mythic consciousness and myth, to name but some of the obstacles one encounters in man's long-evolved philosophic and religious labyrinth. This is not the place, obviously, to elaborate on the structure of human activity. I mention it here because the major flaw of the present work is its failure to probe deeply enough. As a result, masses of data are gathered, but never held together within the frame- work of a unified set of insights; effort is spent on explaining studies made about problems in Japanese society and psychol- ogy, but the reader is given no real understanding of the reasons for the social and psychological problems. Thus, for</page><page sequence="3">204 Monumenta Nlpponica, XXIV, I-2 example, several key terms are used throughout, such as religion, religiosity, faith, and religious sentiment, yet their meanings are not clarified in themselves and in their relations to one another. Would it not be fruitful to see if the Japanese 'religiosity', 'religious senti- ment', 'religious feeling', 'religious aware- ness', 'religious mind' and so on are nothing more than that notion of the superhuman or supernatural which any rational human, precisely because he is human and rational, can naturally evolve (on the level of understanding) and this notion's counterpart in sensitivity (on the level of experience, therefore) which is a sense of the uncanny, the mysterious, the eerie, that Rudolf Otto has described so carefully? If they are, then we can place this notion of rthe superhuman or supernatural and its overflow into sensitivity accurately at a stage in the process leading to faith, and avoid mis- taking it for faith itself; we can measure, too, the distance which separates this stage from religion, whose exercise con- sists essentially, according to Vatican II's Declaration on Religious Freedom (?3), 'in those internal, voluntary, and free acts whereby man sets the course of his life directly toward God', and therefore presupposes faith. The arguments made throughout the book, and of course the conclusions reached, suffer from this failure to define terms carefully and relate them to one another within a sound psychological framework. (I say sound advisedly; at times, for instance, the author speaks of intuition as if it were non-cognitive [pp. I94, I95, I96].) Lack of clarity is one unfortunate result. Lack of consistency is another. Sometimes Japanese intuition- ism is put down as a fault (pp. 92, I39); more often it appears as a virtue (pp. I76- 7, I94-6, and passim); the Japanese are described innumerable times as non- logical, non-intellectual, 'thinkers with their hearts', but scattered here and there are places in which we find that Japanese believers 'want their faith to be real, even logical' (p. 32), that the author seems to agree that native Japanese preachers-as opposed to foreign preachers-are 'philos- ophical', and their preaching 'theoretical' (p. I76, citation), and that the author himself chides twelve Japanese scholars for looking at Christianity 'with their eyes' and not 'with their hearts' (p. i58). As a final remark, I do not think the author has done himself a service by the last ten lines on page 255. After the patient reader has forged on through page after page of data and explanations, always spurred on by the oft-repeated and urgent insistence on the seriousness of the problems to be solved, he cannot but be taken aback when he reads, at the end of his labors, that the author writes off the possibility of finding answers through science or research, that he con- fesses to having acted 'out of indolence and with a sense of humor', and that he evaluates his book as 'at best . .. a melange of educated guesses'.
