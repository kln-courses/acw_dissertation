Behaviour XXVII</page><page sequence="2">2 A. P. SILVERMAN social behaviour of laboratory rats (GRANT &amp; MACKINTOSH, I963; GRANT, I96I, I963) provides the basis for such an approach in a species convenient for pharmacological studies. In this paper I wish to describe a series of experiments, chiefly with chlorpromazine, but also with other drugs, since the comparison throws some light on the behavioural mechanisms involved. It will be most useful to organise the paper by suspending blocks of experi- mental results on a thread of argument, rather than having the facts at one end of the paper and the ideas at the other. Some forty to fifty distinct acts or postures have been recognised in the behaviour of male laboratory rats in social situations. GRANT &amp; MACKINTOSH (I963) and GRANT (I963) showed that these occur in statistically distinct sequences. Groups of sequentially related elements could be described in motivational terms and vary in parallel by strain and situation (GRANT, I96I). It seems a hypothesis worth testing, that a supposedly "psychotropic" drug would alter the occurrence of such groups of elements uniformly and explicably. II. METHOD A detailed example, using chlorpromazine (SILVERMAN, I965) of the method of observation and statistical analysis is given elsewhere. In outline: after isolating rats for a few days, the introduction of one (the "partner") into the home cage of another releases their social behaviour in a short period of the experimenter's choice. Drug effects are revealed by comparing the behaviour of drug- and saline-injected rats ("experimentals") to the same partners. One observer watched all experimental rats, another the partners (except Tests 2 to 5, where they alternated). Each spoke the code name for an element as his rat performed it, recording on a stereophonic tape-recorder. He simultaneously activated one pen of a paper-strip recorder for a permanent record of each introduction. Introductions lasted ten minutes, in which an average sample of about 300 elements of all kinds could be recorded for each animal, with a maximum of 500. Unless otherwise stated when the individual tests are listed, details were as follows: The rats were males of an agouti strain bred in the laboratory. After weaning they were kept in groups (usually of four), and were moved into the experimental rooms, where the diurnal lighting cycle was reversed. This was at the age of nine to eleven weeks and at least two weeks before test. They were kept one rat per cage for one week, since this period appears to lead to the maximum social activity on introduction. Food and water were available at all times. Each of the six partners was introduced once on each</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 3 of three successive mornings, meeting one saline- and two (different) drug- injected rats in a suitably counter-balanced order (see Fig. I). In some tests the whole procedure was repeated after a week's interval, the partners remaining as partners, the experimentals re-assigned to equate the experience of the animals receiving each treatment. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride was taken from ampoules and given in doses of o.5 to 4 mg/kg. Other drugs were all in crystalline form: Benactyzine HCI Experimental Fig. I. in doses of 0.25 to 4 mg/kg, dl-Amphetamine sulphate at I to 5 mg/kg (the dextro isomer is said to be twice as potent as the laevo), and two derivatives of pethidine at I to 4 mg/kg. GK 23 is I-ethanobenzene, 3-methyl, 4-(I-methyl benzene-piperidin-)-4-ol; GK 26 has the identical formula but for ending as -piperidyl-4-propionate. Saline was taken directly from ampoules, other injections were made up daily by adding distilled water. Injections were intra-peritoneal in a volume of I mllkg, and in most cases were made about half-a-minute before the partner was introduced. However, amphetamine, and in early tests benacty- zine, were given fifteen minutes before introduction, with no consistent difference to benactyzine's effects. In Test 7 part 2, chlorpromazine was given an hour before - this will be discussed later. The data obtained were the total numbers of each kind of element shown by six rats given a drug and six given saline, meeting the same partners for ten minutes each; and were subjected to a series of x2 tests. In the first, the figures were cast in a table of 2 X N (N varies slightly, since some elements are not always frequent enough for separate treatment). The overall value of X2 is an approximate measure of the total behavioural effect of the drug,</page><page sequence="4">4 A. P. SILVERMAN and the contribution of each element can be used to tell which ones have been significantly increased or reduced by the drug. It would be tedious to list and interpret the elements individually altered in each experiment, but some classification is possible. An element may have complex motivation, i.e. have a significantly high probability of leading to or from elements in more than one group, but elements may be classified according to which tendency is predominant. The categories are labelled: Exploration of the physical environment; Investigation (exploration of the other rat), together with Mating; Aggression (elements associated sta- tistically with Bite) ; Submission (Flight but the rats remain in close proximity) ; Escape (Flight away from the other rat); Maintenance (self- grooming, eating, etc.); and Residual (for elements of obscure motivation or rare occurrence). Two x2 tests are then applied to each category. The first (at i degree of freedom) estimates whether the total for the category (compared with the total for all other behaviour) is different for the "drug" and "saline" animals. Since all the elements in a category share their main motivational factor, any drug effect on the latter ought to summate. Secondly, since a large effect on one element alone might lead to a spurious effect on the category total, the n elements within each category are compared in a table of 2 X n for their variability. Category and variability chi-squares can then be represented by blocks and lines in a histogram, and it is in this form that most results will be presented. The behaviour of the partners (who have not received any injection) will reflect any true behavioural effects of a drug. If rats also perceive and react systematically to differences in the behaviour of drug- and saline-injected rats, they reinforce a human observer's conclusions. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results will be given in sections, in order to render a mass of data a little less unwieldy. At the end of each section, its relevance to the main argument will be summarised. i. INITIAL TESTS WITH CHLORPROMAZINE Table I lists several experiments with chlorpromazine (the reference num- bers show the order in which they were made) at various doses; among other things, they investigate the repeatability of the method. In Tests 7 and I2, the same rats were re-assigned (i.e. two of the original salines remained as controls, two received 4 mglkg of the drug, etc.) and re-used after two week's interval. In Test 5, unlike all subsequent ones, each observer</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 5 watched experimental and partner rats alternately; in Test 6 albino rats were used in place of the usual agoutis; in Test 7/2 injection was an hour before the partner was introduced; and Tests IO, II and I2 were "blind", the observers did not know which solution contained the drug.

The value of x2 gives an approximate measure of the difference in occurrence of the (df + i) elements between six rats given the stated dose of the drug and six given saline (the two comparisons for Test 7/I are with the same controls, likewise for Test 7/2) ; similarly for partners meeting drug and saline rats. Unless otherwise stated, p &amp;lt; .ooi. Further explanation in text. The behavioural differences expressed by the experimentals' x2 in Table I are shown in Figs. 2-4, the biggest dose first. From Fig. 2 it is apparent that in rats given 4 mg/kg chlorpromazine: Exploration of the cage was unchanged or increased. Investigation and Mating was generally reduced as a whole, though single elements (in this rather mixed category) could be increased. Aggression was always reduced, usually to a dramatic extent. Submission ("Social Flight") was not altered. Escape (away from the other rat) was greatly increased. The increase was less in the test where Exploration was increased. Maintenance was usually unchanged. Residual was unchanged or slightly reduced. In short, the behaviour where one rat approaches another, Aggression and, to a lesser extent, Investigation and Mating, was reduced. Behaviour where one rat withdraws from another, Escape, was increased (note that this includes intention movements and static postures like Crouch, as well as</page><page sequence="6">6 A. P.

Smaller doses (I-2 mg/kg) gave substantially the same results (Fig. 3) (SILVERMAN (I965) analysed Test 71I and briefly described the elements referred to in the present paper): Exploration was not altered.

Observation in cages, after 7 days isolation, as usual. Investigation and Mating was reduced (particularly Mating) in two of the three tests. Aggression was reduced in two tests. In the third, elements showing the most "intense" Aggression were reduced (Offensive Sideways and Attack). Offensive Sideways was always the most reduced; Offensive Upright and Aggressive Groom the least. Submission waIs increased in two tests. Escape was increased in all cases, especially the test where Submission was not affected. Maintenance was reduced in two tests. Residual elements were not affected. The smallest dose used was o.s mg/kg (Fig. 4) and may have been too small for consistency in this situation. In Test 5 results resembled those at larger doses but were less marked (Exploration and most elements of</page><page sequence="8">8 A. P. SILVERMAN Escape were increased, Aggression reduced, and the rest unaffected); but Test 6 showed hardly any effect except a reduction in Maintenance. Test 712, with injection an hour early, seems to have been a special case and will be discussed below in Section 4. Chlorpromazine led nearly always to a definite reduction in "total activity", in that the total number of elements recorded for the drugged animals averaged about io % less than for the controls, 40 % less in one test. x2_ 20 - Test Es6 40 Ea 7/2 x2 X Exploration Investigation Aggression Submission Escape Maintenance Residual and Mating Fig. 4. Effect of chlorpromazine at 0.5 mg/kg. Partners showed more exploration of the cage and of the injected rat when meeting chlorpromazine-injected animals instead of controls and also some increases in aggressive and mating elements, with correspondingly less of both Submission and Escape. Some Maintenance and Residual elements, which can occur as displacement activities or which give the appearance of "frustration" were also commonly increased, suggesting that chlorpromazine causes rats to present stimuli arousing the partner's Aggression but (bv their Escape) not releasing it (see Section 7 below). 2. ANALYSIS OF A SINGLE TEST There are a number of mechanisms which could conceivably account for chlorpromazine's effects. They can be evaluated when the situation is ap- propriately altered and by comparison with different drugs, and also by a detailed examination of the results in each test. In Test IO chlorpromazine was given ("blind") in I mglkg, and the six drug and six saline animals displayed the numbers of elements shown in Table 2. The Table also gives the contribution to x2 of each element (those significantly increased or reduced by the drug are marked with + or -</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 9 respectively), and the Category and Variability x2 values histogrammed in Fig. 3 above. In this test, the overall activity was scarcely (&lt; 4%) reduced by the drug, but there was a highly significant (X230 = I82.8) re-distribution of this behaviour in the usual way (Fig. 3). Far more than the chance expectation of elements were individually altered in occurrence by the drug. Consideration of the alterations in individual elements and in categories as a whole evidently lead to similar conclusions. Thus Approach and the elements representing approach-withdrawal conflict are reduced, while the reduction in Sniff indicates reduced Investigation and Mating also. The reduction in Self-groom, etc., and Drink, etc., are self-explanatory, but are compatible with indicating reduced "displacement." The other elements reduced all represent Aggression (that in Offensive Sideways alone would make the whole test significant at the 2% level), although the less intense elements of aggression were not affected in this test. Conversely, the increases in Retreat (by definition), Crouch, Under Hop- per, Attend, and, in the other category, Defensive Upright, all indicate an increase in Flight. In no category were elements individually altered in opposite directions. Something further is apparent from the Flight categories. The increase in the fast-moving Retreat is barely significant, the main increase is in postures (Defensive Upright, Crouch, Under Hopper), which often last for many seconds at a time. Scan (i.e. apparent Exploration without movement of the hind legs) is also increased. Thus chlorpromazine reduced locomotion since there were fewer fast-moving acts and more static postures, while higher doses gave an impression of a slowing-down of movements generally. Total activity is also usually reduced. Nevertheless, although the correlation is generally true, it is by no means complete. Some slow elements (e.g. Aggressive Groom) were reduced, some fast ones (e.g. Retreat) were in- creased by the drug. The locomotor effect does not, therefore, account for the motivational results, which must be independently controlled. It is, in any case, hard to see how a reduction in locomotion would lead simultaneously to a reduction in Aggression, no change in Exploration (even its mobile element), and an increase in both Submission and Escape. In principle, it is possible that the drug had a more peripheral sensory effect. If it had, changes would be expected in Exploration, assuming this is particularly related to sensory input. There were, in fact, changes in some largely exploratory elements. Nevertheless, such an effect must have been very small and of minor importance, since these elements were altered in different directions: Scan and Attend were (just) increased; Approach and</page><page sequence="10">IO A.

Although Exploration was increased in some tests described in section I above, it was unaltered in most. Similarly, it does not seem possible to explain the results on the basis of a deterioration in muscle tone or motor co-ordination, if one can judge by the elements which presumably make the greatest demands on these. Of the elements where the rat usually or always stands on hind-legs and tail, fore- iegs in the air, Scan and Defensive Upright were increased; Offensive Upright, Wash and Push were unchanged; and climbing On Bars was not af fected. *. DTSCUSSION IN RELATION TO THE LITERATURE ON THE ACTION OF CHLORPROMAZINE Chlorpromazine has the effects i) of reducing Aggression and other ap- proach tendencies, and increasing Flight from another rat; 2) of reducing locomotion; and, just possibly, 3) of reducing sensory input in some way. These results confirm the literature on drug effects on social behaviour in animals. Chlorpromazine and related phenothiazines are among the most potent of the many drugs which suppress fighting in mice (e.g. TEDESCHI et al., I959; JANSSEN et al., 1960; see the review by COOK &amp; KELLEHER, I963). However these papers, careful though they are, treat 'fighting' as a single unit without internal structure, and are not concerned with possible mechanisms for the drug's action at a behavioural level. NORTON &amp; DE BEER (1956); NORTON (I957) found that chlorpromazine reduced Hostility and Sociability in cats (to the observer), but increased Excitement; they do not explain why the elements they list should be in these categories. Although HEIMSTRA (I96I) found that chlorpromazine increased Dominance, this was in terms of competition for food in starved rats; he confirms that fighting behaviour (undefined) was reduced, since the drugged rat would ignore the other except to "tenaciously resist efforts . . . at displacement" from the food. Chlorpromazine's effect on locomotion has often been noticed (e.g. KOPF &amp; NIELSEN, 1959), and has been held to account for the drug's effect on redlucing bar-pressing for water (BINDRA &amp; MENDELSON, I963), and on apparently suppressing conditioned avoidance (POSLUNS, I962) and shock- induced fighting (TEDESCHI et al., I959) ; though on the last point SCRIABINE &amp; BLAKE (I962) say that for equivalent reductions in locomotion, chlor- promazine is more active in reducing fighting than meprobamate, which TEDESCHI had found to be the most selective of many drugs. IRWIN (196I) even found locomotor effects to be a better guide than conditioned avoidance ones to clinical usefulness.</page><page sequence="12">I2 A. P. SILVERMAN However, there is evidence in the literature, as well as in the present study (sections 2, 6), that chlorpromazine's reduction of locomotion is distinct from its other effects, though no doubt contributing to them. What is not so clear is whether the reduction in Aggression and increase in Flight are separate effects, or whether the former is a consequence of the latter. The literature gives no direct help on this, since the drug studies on social behaviour do not distinguish between the two tendencies. Indeed there is a flat contradiction, if one makes the plausible assumption that flight in a social situation represents the same thing as avoidance responses to a con- ditioned stimulus for imminent shock. There is considerable evidence (reviewed e.g. by DEWS &amp; MORSE, I96I) that chlorpromazine reduces responses that prevent the electric shock being received, at doses that do not interfere with similar responses subsequent to the shock. This is often explicitly defined as a reduction in fear or anxiety (e.g. HUGHES &amp; ROUN- TREE, I96I; N. E. MILLER, I964; R. E. MILLER et al., I957). Such avoidancelescape responses include climbing an insulated pole (COOK &amp; WEIDLEY, I957) or jumping into the safe half of a "shuttle-box" (IRWIN et al., I959). HUGHES &amp; ROUNTREE (I96I) showed that, with chlorpromazine, reduced avoidance still allowed rats ". . . to discriminate the correct route of escape". RAY (I963) conditioned rats to respond to one sound by pressing a lever to avoid shock, then to press a second lever in response to a sound of different pitch for milk. Testing only those rats that learned the dis- crimination reliably, he found that chlorpromazine (and some other drugs, but not, notably, a barbiturate) selectively inhibited avoidance lever-pressing for quite long periods after food-lever-pressing had returned. Controlling thus for effects on motor activity, sensory input and discriminative ability, he concluded that chlorpromazine selectively reduced avoidance. RAY'S results, especially, seem convincing (but compare RAY, I964, using a single ambivalent stimulus). Such avoidance could, of course, be quite distinct from Flight in a social situation, but some reconciliation of the main argument will be attempted below. Meanwhile, it may be relevant that the drug disrupted the response learned with the most difficulty and that the drugs were given under conditions where, although the one lever still brought food, no shocks were given in any case: some authors (e.g. GONZALES and Ross, I96I, MILLER et al., I957) though not all (e.g. DENENBERG et al., I959, HUNT, I956), found that chlorpromazine accelerated extinction of conditioned avoidance responses. However, Ray states that the avoidance always returned the following day without reinforcement. Not everyone is prepared to deduce any central motivational factor from observed behaviour, i.e. to infer drive from tendency. Among those who do,</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS I3 the conclusion that chlorpromazine affects the avoidance in a conditioned avoidance situation is often disputed. Most clearly, DOTY &amp; DOTY (I963) found that chlorpromazine delayed the acquisition and accelerated the ex- tinction of the response of jumping into a safe box, as it should if it does reduce "anxiety". However, these effects were significantly greater if the task was made harder by adding the need to discriminate the safe one of two routes, and the drug also increased errors in discrimination (contra HUGHES &amp; ROUNTREE, I96I). Therefore, chlorpromazine did not so much reduce anxiety as "interfere with processes necessary for problem solution." An alternative, as DEWS put it (I958), is to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces the "stimulus control" over behaviour. A phrase like responsiveness to exteroceptive stimuli seems preferable, as it would focus more on the animal. Thus WEISS &amp; LATIES (I963) trained rats in a cold room to switch on a heat lamp. They found chlorpromazine, at a dose itself lowering skin temperature, nevertheless reduced the rate of lever-pressing, while amphe- tamine (despite an excessive rise in skin temperature) increased it. These drugs, but not a barbiturate, therefore "wveaken the control that various stimuli exert over behaviour." R-educed responsiveness, perhaps with reduced locomotion, would account for results like those of GROSSMAN (I96i), as neatly as his own interpre- tation of a balance between general depression and specific depression of fear ("fear" is used for quite objective behaviour, in spite of the emotional connotations). He measured lever-pressing for food while an increasingly loud buzzer signalled increasingly probable shock. Chlorpromazine not only lessened the initial response rate but, with or without actual shock, also lessened the effect of the buzzer, so that the net rate was higher under chlorpromazine. The concept of reduced responsiveness must be specified a little further. It is suggested that chlorpromazine reduces the effect of stimuli which would divert the animal from whatever he is already doing; it is not suggested that the drug impairs the perception or recognition of the stimuli as such. Chlorpromazine might be said to increase "set", to reduce the releasing or arousing function of a stimulus, but not necessarily its orientation or cue function. An animal that resumes obtaining food or milk, warmth, or pouncing on prey (SACRA et al., I957), or even just omits energetic climbing or jumping, in spite of warning of shock, might have become restricted to the tendency previously aroused, rather than to have reduced avoidance. In anthropomorphic terms, the animal might have become more obstinate. Or fatalistic. To summarise, evidence in the literature supports the conclusions from</page><page sequence="14">14 A. P. SILVERMAN rat's social behaviour, that chlorpromazine reduces aggression and reduces locomotion. However, in a fairly intense social situation, the drug increases Flight, while the literature shows that it also reduces conditioned avoidance. This could be a reduction in flight, but can (according to some authors) better be interpreted as a reduction in responsiveness to (distracting) exteroceptive stimuli. Three final reports imply that chlorpromazine may increase flight from an ambivalent stimulus, not reduce it, as most of the literature would suggest. GELLER et al. (I962) found that chlorpromazine reduced a stable rate of bar- pressing in response to a stimulus signalling both food and shock simul- taneously; they studiously refrain from motivational comment; see also RAY ( I964). GROSSMAN &amp; MILLER (196I) used an alley where the rats had previously received both food and shock: they ran slower under chlor- promazine if shock was not given, but faster if it was. Several interpretations of these results are open; locomotion must have been affected in any case; but all three are clearly consistent with the drug inducing flight. 4. SOME TESTS OF THE RESPONSIVENESS HYPOTHESIS Whether or not the literature may be re-interpreted in this way, it is still worth examining the idea that chlorpromazine reduces responsiveness to sensory stimuli, or at least to their "arousal" function. It is certainly true that in the environment of a laboratory cage, the most conspicuous, or novel, stimuli are those from the other rat, and behaviour involving approach to him was selectively reduced by chlorpromazine - be- haviour not oriented to the other rat was scarcely affected. Between males, it is to be expected that overt mating behaviour will not be at a high or consistent level; but it is noteworthy that the initial Investigation (see figs 2-4) was not reduced as greatly or uniformly as Aggression. It suggests that the drug alters the response to stimuli more than their perception. It is not easy to devise an unequivocal test of general responsiveness (as distinct from specific), but some contributory evidence comes from the experiments listed in Table 3 and figures 4-7. The most obvious possibility was to shorten the pre-experimental isolation from seven days to, say, three. There is some evidence for the plausible assumption that, up to a point, the social tendencies increase with increasing deprivation of rodent companionship. Shorter deprivation should therefore leave less room for a drug to demonstrate a reduction in such behaviour, and it would have less apparent effect. (The converse argument, that shorter isolation would allow barbiturates greater scope to demonstrate increasing responsiveness, was used by SILVERMAN, (in press).</page><page sequence="15">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS TABLE 3 Experiments on whether chlorpromazine reduces "responsiveness".

SILVERMAN increased), and Maintenance (in which some displacement activities would occur) was also increased. However, the striking point was the very much reduced overall difference from the controls: X236 = 94.3, whereas in test 7/I, at the same dose, X230 = I63.I. That is to say, the drug had less effect. A second possible test arises from the suggestion (e.g. CAMPBELL, I960) that deprivation of food or water does not so much increase "spontaneous" activity as to increase the response to any stimulus change. Certainly, what- ever the mechanism, I2 (but not 24) hours acute deprivation of food appears to intensify the aggression and slightly reduce the Escape shown by a rat (SILVERMAN, unpublished). Fig. 6 shows the comparison of chlorpromazine at I mglkg with saline, in rats acutely deprived of food for I2 hours. The food hopper was replaced just before injection, but despite being used in the usual way as a place to retreat to, the food was practically ignored while the other rat was present. The drug had no significant effect on the pattern of behaviour (x2 = 30.0 NS), i.e. the starvation antagonised its effects, nevertheless there was the usual io % reduction in overall activity (i888 for the controls to I699). Reduced responsiveness implies a probable distinction. True escape (move- ment negatively oriented to the other rat and part of social behaviour) would be reduced by chlorpromazine. Avoidance, a reluctance to behave socially at all, would be increased. Such a distinction is not easy to make in practice, especially in the confined space of a cage. Two tests were, therefore, made in larger runs about 2.5 X I metres. Two bricks formed a "refuge", narrow but just long enough for two rats to squeeze into. In these tests (i8 and I9) the injected rats were the intruders, isolated three days only. Only four animals received each treatment. Interpretation of the results is also limited by the runs being open and bare enough to act as "open fields" - some of the partners would climb out overnight unless shut in. In these tests chlorpromazine at 2 and at I mglkg was compared with GK 26 at the same doses (see section 5 below) and the results are shown in fig. 7. In neither test did chlorpromazine have any effect on the non- social Exploration, Maintenance or Residual categories, but there were defi- nite reductions in Aggression. There were mixed effects on Investigation and Mating. Approach was reduced in both tests, while some Mating ele- ments were increased, perhaps because the partners in runs were apt to Retreat and stop, which is also what females in oestrus do. There was no consistent effect on the Escape category as a whole but there was evidence of a small increase in Flight: increased Submission in one test and in the other (despite lessened Retreat), increases in entering the brick refuge and, when it was already occupied, in Squeal. In this test it is conceivable that</page><page sequence="17">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS I7 the Flight was from the "open field" rather than from the other rat. Note that in both tests, chlorpromazine did reduce Aggression and some other approach behaviour. The last piece of evidence on "responsiveness" comes from one possible interpretation of the results of test 712 (fig. 4 above in section I). In this test, the animals were re-used (after an interval of two weeks) and, in order to compare with procedures in the literature (e.g. HEIMSTRA, I96I), intro- duction of the partner was delayed till one hour after injection. At 4 mglkg, chlorpromazine had its usual effects, if small ones (fig. 2), but 0.5 mglkg produced a unique reduction in Escape. Yet it was the saline controls that had changed rather than the chlorpromazine rats. Comparing 0.5 mg/kg in 712 with i mg/kg in 7/I, there is no large difference - using just the cate- gory totals, for simplicity, X26 = 49.7. Similarly for the 4 mg/kg dose in the two parts of the test, X26 = 63.4. There is a much larger difference between the saline controls (two of the six being the same individuals), for X26= i66.8. It seems that the hour's delay caused the saline controls to reduce Investigation, Mating and Aggression and increase their Escape. Independently of the drug's usual effects on these categories, it protected the rats from the effects of the delay. To summarise, these tests of "responsiveness" did, on the whole, support the idea that chlorpromazine reduces the extent to which any given stimulus releases appropriate behaviour. Shortening pre-experimental isolation and depriving the animals of food diminished the effect of the drug; in the runs, some, but not all, of the tendencies to approach the other rat were reduced and the drug largely inhibited the effects of an hour's delay in a small dose, despite its own effects still apparent in a larger one. The evidence on "responsiveness" thus seems reasonable, but not conclusive, and probably not the sole effect of the drug. 5. GK 26 AND GK 23, CONTROLS FOR THE SOCIAL AVOIDANCE HYPOTHESIS The implication was drawn that if chlorpromazine reduces responsiveness, the increase in the Escape category should be described as avoidance of social interactions rather than escape from the other rat in a strict sense. The comparison with GK 26, especially in the runs, and with GK 23, is instructive. GK 26, a reversed ester of the analgesic pethidine, was described as producing catatonia and preliminary experiments had shown that a sub- catatonic dose markedly increased the number and duration of "held postures." Held postures, which occur in non-injected rats, were defined Behaviour XXVII 2</page><page sequence="18">i8 A. P. SILVERMAN by the rat remaining noticeably motionless in a posture for at least one second (rarely up to several minutes) after the stimulus for it, the other rat, had walked away. They could be of no particular posture (Freeze), but were more commonly of recognised Flight elements (usually Crouch, Defensive Upright, or Submit). TABLE 4 Tests of GK 26 and GK 23.

A reduction in the overall activity by half in test 8 meant that when exploratory or escape elements occurred more often than in the controls the x2 value was very high. While everything else was re- duced (but not abolished) in this test, it is noteworthy that Submission was affected relatively little. In test i, Exploration was less mobile but non- social behaviour was otherwise little affected; Aggression and Submission were reduced, Mating was slightly and Escape greatly increased. This picture is very close, on paper, to that produced by a similar dose of chlorpromazine, but the drugs give a somewhat different impression. Chlorpromazine-injected rats most commonly Crouch with a round, hunched back and fur coarse and fluffed. GK 26 typically induces a tense Crouch with back straight, shoulders low and fur sleeked. But since all intermediates occur in the same animal, the distinction is difficult to observe reliably; Crouch has, in any case, little signal-value to other rats (GRANT, I963). Chlorpromazine appears to slow rats' movements; but with GK 26 (test I), held postures accounted for I5% of the time the rats were observed and their total activity was reduced in proportion, so that the speed of each element was probably unaffected. Certainly the stop-and-go movements are very characteristic. Such differences are very likely purely motor but it seemed that GK 26 did not reduce responsiveness. Rather it specifically increased the Flight</page><page sequence="19">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 19 300- x2 - 200 100 80 60 - 40- 20 0-- ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ r 40- 60 - 80F Test 100 CS V) CS 120. 3&gt; 22 C &gt;3 ~ ~ C CS Fig. 8.

At a large dose, Flight would be increased too much for the animal to show any other tendencies, hence activity in general and Aggression in particular would be reduced. At a small dose, however, a small increase in Flight would not be incompatible even with Aggression; and increased activity would be possible, especially if controls showed less than the maximum observable. Two tests of 1 mglkg GK 26 are shown in fig. 9, an intense one at seven days isolation, where the controls were unusually active.

In the other test, af ter three days, GK 26 increased overall activity by nearly 40% (I653 elements to 229I), and: Exploration was slightly increased. Investigation and Mating reduced.

In the runs (fig. io), GK 26 at 2 mg/kg (and three days' isolation) had much the same effect as chlorpromazine and as the larger dose in cages, there was a reduction in Aggression and an increase in Escape. The small, 1 mg/kg, test in runs resembled that at 7 days in cages, in that there was an increase in Investigation and Mating but the sole other change was a reduc-</page><page sequence="21">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 2I x230 20 - 10- 0 i 10 20 Test Dose 30 18 2 mg/kg o 0 6 gk IO mg/kg 60- g Eg9 4 mg/kg~~~~~~1 IO mg/kg 40,- cl, bL '6 06 b bO *S |i s Fig. io.

SILVERMAN tion in Escape. As with chlorpromazine in the same test, this could be ex- plicable as escape from the "open field" instead of from the other rat since this reduction was mainly of Retreat and Elevated Crouch, while entering the brick refuge was increased. Therefore, the tests at 1 mglkg did not, after all, confirm any specific in- crease in Flight at this dose. The important point, however, is the contrast to chlorpromazine at the same dose - there was (i) an increase in overall activity, (2) an increase in Investigation and Mating and (3) no reduction in Aggression (see especially test I9, 1 mg/kg in runs). Thus, whether or not there was primarily a small increase in Flight (as suggested by the increase in Submission in test I411), there was an increase in approach to the other rat. There was no reduction in responsiveness in general, there may have been an increase. GK 23 is chemically very similar. It did not increase overall activity as much as its relative, but a 3 days 1 mglkg seemed to increase orientation to the other rat (fig. ii) in that non-social Exploration and Maintenance were reduced and Submission greatly increased. At io days, controls were also more active socially but Aggression and Submission were still increased, slightly by the small dose and considerably by 4mglkg, which, nevertheless, reduced Investigation and Mating. Unlike GK 26, GK 23 never increased Escape even in the larger dose. GK 26 and GK 23, therefore, increase behaviour oriented to another animal but this appears unlike the general increase in responsiveness attri- buted to lysergic acid diethylamide or small doses of barbiturates by SILVER- AIAN (unpubl.). For GK 23 increases Submission (perhaps Aggression plus Flight in this case) and GK 26 certainly increases Escape quite speci- fically in the larger doses. A relatively specific increase in Flight respon- siveness ("drive") fits the evidence rather better. Thus, the similarity of the results between 4mg/kg of chlorpromazine and GK 26 breaks down if the dose is reduced. There have been reports that small doses of chlorpromazine can increase 'excitement' in individuals (CLARK &amp; STEELE, I963) but I have seen no evidence of this. 6. EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, CONTROLS FOR THE ACTIVITY HYPOTHESIS It is possible that this pattern of effects on social behaviour, broadly of reduced Aggression and increased Flight, is related relatively simply to the reduced overall activity - if the overall number of elements recorded in unit time is reduced, it might be that Aggression is merely the most sensitive indicator of activity and Escape the least. Or if one is reduced the other</page><page sequence="23">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 23 is increased as a statistical artefact. Either hypothesis would have to be ela- borated to account for the relatively small and rare effects on Exploration, Maintenance, Submission, etc., but both are conceivable. Alternatively, the primary effect might be to increase the Flight tendency as such, which, in turn, reduces both specific behaviour incompatible with Flight and the overall activity in consequence. Such a hypothesis is not quite adequate even for GK 26 and a fortiori would not really account for the detailed effects of chlorpromazine, either for the "responsiveness" tests or for the relative independence of locomotor effects as shown in section 2 above. Further evidence comes from consideration of the effects of amphetamine. TABLE 5 Effects of amphetamine.

The d-isomer is said to be twice as potent as the 1-. 2) deprived of food I2 hours. Amphetamine was originally used on the expectation that a well-known central stimulant would increase all behaviour equally (except, of course, food and water intake). The tests are listed in Table 5 and the results shown in figs I2 and 13 by dose, although there was no consistent difference in the effects of i and 5 mglkg. Experimental design was slightly different in the earliest tests; and the size of the x2 value for test i6 is due to the fact that the controls ate, more than in most tests, after I2 hours food depri- vation; amphetamine injected animals did not. There was an increase in the overall activity, averaging about i6% (2 to 27%). Within this, at both dosages: Exploration was sometimes increased. Investigation and Mating, sometimes increased as a whole, was commonly unchanged; the great variability was mainly composed of increases in Attempt Mount, accompanied by a great reduction in Sniff and other Investigatory elements generally associated with Mating. Aggression was uniformly reduced, especially in the more complete or intense elements (Aggressive Posture, Offensive Sideways, Attack).</page><page sequence="24">24 A. P. SILVERMAN Submission was sometimes increased but Defensive Sideways and Submit were sometimes reduced nevertheless. Escape was generally, but not always, increased, especially in test i6 where food deprivation had apparently reduced Escape in the controls. Maintenance was uniformly greatly reduced or even abolished; the re- duction was not only in Eat and Drink but also in all forms of self-grooming. Residual was unaffected except for an increase in Push in test I. Partners correspondingly showed more Exploration and less Flight. It is clear that although amphetamine stimulates "activity" as a whole and chlorpromazine depresses it, the drugs have qualitatively rather similar effects on Aggression and Flight.

SILVERMAN avoiding all tactile stimulation, with the exception of a curiously compulsive Attempt Mount (compare human amphetamine addicts, BELL &amp; TRETHOWAN, I96I). The reduction in self-grooming is, I believe, a new observation, al- though the anorexia is, of course, well-known. In certain situations, amphetamine does often increase the rate of operant responding for positive reinforcement (see the review by COOK &amp; KELLEHER, I963) including warmth (WEISS &amp; LATIES, I963). Yet it is consistent with the drug's increase of Flight in a social situation that it appears easier to show amphetamine's effect in avoidance conditioning of various kinds (GELLER &amp; SEIFTER, I960; CARLTON &amp; DIDAMO, I96I; HEARST &amp; WHALEN, I963, prefer an explanation of the avoidance results in terms of reduced freezing, although they do not exclude "emotionality.") The neatest distinc- tion between amphetamine's multiple effects, on thirst, avoidance, respon- siveness and sheer motor activity, comes, however, from the elegant ex- periments of TEITELBAUM &amp; DERKS (I958). 7. CHLORPROMAZINE INCREASES FLIGHT BEYOND THE INFLUENCE OF THE PARTNERS For present purposes the interest of amphetamine is that it can increase both Flight and activity simultaneously. Although many of the effects of chlorpromazine can be explained as re- duced responsiveness, there remains evidence that it does nevertheless in- crease Flight. I) The attempt to distinguish strict Escape from Avoidance was not very successful. Apart from the difficulty of differentiating the alternative forms of Crouch, the tendencies share other elements. Thus, Flag and Evade, intention movements of Crouch in one context, are also characteristic- ally used by a rat eating a food pellet when another rat approaches it. It follows that the distinction between avoidance and escape may not be a valid one. 2) If it is valid, then when chlorpromazine increases avoidance, true escape should be reduced in parallel with other social behaviour. The element most plausibly called "escape" is Retreat, but while from I9 possible com- parisons (in the i6 tests where chlorpromazine was used) Retreat was only increased once, it was still only reduced twice. 3) In some tests at a low dose (tests Io, II, i8, and 2o; figs. 3, 7 and 5), the escape category was not significantly increased by chlorpromazine or was increased less than usual. It was in just these tests that the drug increased Submission, which is a form of Flight not to be confused with avoidance, it involves the rat approaching the partner.</page><page sequence="27">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 27 Perhaps this increase in Flight is not a direct effect of chlorpromazine, but an indirect one through the partners. The suggestion is that under the drug, rats show enough social behaviour to arouse the aggression of the partners but not enough to release it through the proper ritualised elements - they still investigate the partner, but they avoid him more than usual. They Crouch. GRANT (I963) showed that Crouch induced more Aggressive Groom and displacement activities in the other rat than Submit did. The partners would be frustrated by the drugged rat's avoidance, since the re- leasing stimuli for Aggressive Posture, etc., are not present and they would Aggressive Groom, Pull or Bite. The extra bites would thereupon release the extra true Flight observed in chlorpromazine-injected rats.

There were I9 times (in i6 tests, including the food-deprivation ones to be described elsewhere) when chlorpromazine could be compared with saline, and table 6 shows how often any element was significantly increased or reduced in the partners.</page><page sequence="28">28 A. P. SILVERMAN The table shows that Exploration was increased more often than it was reduced as an indirect effect of the drug (5-o and 3-2 for the two elements in this category) and so were Investigation &amp; Mating elements (I7 times increased in all and I3 reduced, the latter including the two elements of approach-withdrawal conflict). Aggression was, on the whole, more often reduced than increased (II-I7). The "miscellaneous element" is used when an element such as Bite occurs, but too rarely for comparison on its own. In conformity with the hypothesis, the ritualised elements (Offensive Upright and Sideways, Attack, Aggressive posture) were more often reduced and never more than one was increased in any one test. Aggressive Groom was increased twice and never reduced. However, there is no evidence that Pull or Bite were increased (or even occurred significantly at all) in the partners of chlorpromazine-injected rats, so it could not have been these elements which released Flight in the drugged rats. The other effects in the partners are also interesting. Chlorpromazine- reduced Aggression is reflected in the fact that those Flight elements (and Push) which occurred at all were reduced much more often than they were increased (a total of 7 to 36); while Maintenance (including any displace- ment) elements were increased (9-4). 8. EFFECTS OF BENACTYZINE, CONTROLS FOR THE FLIGHT HYPOTHESIS The conclusion that the increase in Flight induced by chlorpromazine is not an indirect effect of the partners, not an artefact of the method of statistical analysis and not, in itself, a consequence of the reduction in Aggression, are all reinforced by comparison with the effects of benactyzine. The tests in which this drug was used are shown in table 7, figs I4 and I5. Some details were varied in early tests (15 or '2-minute delay between injection and introduction, etc. (see Methods p. 3)). The overall activity was not consistently changed by benactyzine, it was sometimes increased and sometimes reduced, but never greatly. Specifically: Exploration was often, but not always, increased. A large increase would imply that the animals showed less social behaviour, i.e. avoided the partners. Investigation &amp; Mating. Benactyzine shows the heterogeneity of this cate- gory since Investigation (exploration) was usually increased, including the elements usually leading to Mating. However, Attempt Mount and Mount were usually very much reduced, as was approach-withdrawal conflict. Aggression was dramatically and uniformly reduced in all cases except one.</page><page sequence="29">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 29 TABLE 7 List of tests made zwith benactyzine.

Submission was sometimes unaffected, sometimes reduced (two of the three elements in this category are ambivalent, having an aggressive com- ponent). Escape was rarely significantly affected as a whole. It was increased by the 4 mg/kg dose in test 4, but to a remarkably small extent. There was often great variability, however, since Retreat was usually reduced and Crouch sometimes increased. Maintenance was rarely affected as a whole but for reduced postcopula- tory grooming. Residual was sometimes reduced, notably Push, Box, etc. Partners showed reductions in Flight and increases in Exploration and Maintenance. It is interesting that, except in the test with albino rats, there was little evidence of differences due to dosage within this range or to different periods of isolation or delay. Benactyzine reduced Aggression, Mating and Submission and increased Exploration, both of the cage and of the other rat. Taken as a whole, however, the striking point is the relative specificity of the reduction in Aggression, especially in conjunction with the lack of any large increase in Flight. Benactyzine is usually reported as having similar effects to chlorpromazine. It reduced conditioned avoidance in rats (JACOBSEN &amp; SKAARUP, I955) and restored pouncing on mice by cats, despite shock (SACRA et al., I957). It inhibited fighting in mice (JANSSEN et al., I960) but, unlike chlorpromazine, at doses causing mydriasis but no reduction in locomotion. The absence of a consistent effect on locomotion is also shown by an increase in response rates in some of "several operant behaviours" (BOREN, I96I). STONE (I960)</page><page sequence="30">A. P. SILVERMAN found that while thiopropazate (related to chlorpromazine) suppressed both avoidance and escape from shock by inhibiting movement, benactyzine per- mitted movement and avoidance learning, but not escape, the rats seemed not to learn while the shock continued.

For present purposes the important evidence is that benactyzine induced a very much greater reduction in Aggression than chlorpromazine, dose for dose, with little or no increase in Escape; while the indirect effects on the partners were similar. Therefore, chlorpromazine's observed increase in Flight must be specific.

The attempt is then made to record as much as possible of what each animal does, in units whose significance has been estimated previously.</page><page sequence="32">32 A. P. SILVERMAN It has been shown that drugs can have quite definite effects on behaviour, no doubt acting at different regions of the CNS. Results were reliable enough for conclusions drawn from detailed study of one experiment to reinforce those from simpler comparisons in several others. The effects of chlorpromazine on the social behaviour of male laboratory rats previously isolated were nearly always as follows: The total number of behavioural elements shown in a given period was reduced by an average of about io %. The proportion of this total devoted to Aggression and, to a lesser extent, to other behaviour (Mating, Investigation) in which one rat approaches another, was substantially reduced. The proportion, and often the absolute amount, of Flight was definitely increased, especially Escape away from the other rat, but often also Sub- mission to him while remaining in close proximity. At the same time, behaviour not oriented primarily to the other animal was substantially unchanged, although Exploration could be increased or Main- tenance reduced to a small extent. To account fully for these effects while bearing in mind evidence in the literature, three conceptually distinct behavioural mechanisms have had to be postulated. The first, well known and not controversial, is that the drug should reduce locomotion, perhaps partly by a general slowing-down but mainly by the animal staying for longer than usual in the same posture. The evidence for this was the reduction in the overall number of elements observed and (section 2) the general, but not invariable, increase in slower postures and reduction in quicker actions. POSLUNS (I962) described the phenomenon as a lengthening of the usual pause before locomotion and be- tween "segments" of the route taken, enough to account for the drug's sup- pression of conditioned avoidance. The concept may be visualised (whatever the neurological facts) by saying that chlorpromazine raises the threshold of the switch mechanism (hindbrain?) initiating and maintaining locomotion. The walking is quite ordinary in form and orientation and the switch in- dependent of motivation. Amphetamine, conversely, would lower its threshold. However, locomotion-lessening is not enough to account for the dispro- portionate decrease in aggression when exploration was unchanged; especially since Amphetamine (section 6) has surprisingly similar effects on the social behaviour in spite of raising the overall activity. The second action postulated for chlorpromazine is, therefore, that it reduces "responsiveness" to external stimuli. This has been suggested several times (e.g. DEWS, I958; WEISS &amp; LATIES, I963) but is not universally accepted (e.g. POSLUNS, I962; RAY,</page><page sequence="33">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 33 I963). In the present form, the distinction between the releasing and directing functions of stimuli is important. Chlorpromazine is not postulated to affect perception or discrimination or orientation but to make it less likely that the animal will change the "type" of behaviour appearing, or its "amount", the Tendencies specifically aroused already. Thus, there was a little evidence (statistically inadequate) that in the few tests where chlorpromazine did not reduce Aggression as a whole, it tended to concentrate it into fewer individuals. Tests of reduced responsiveness in this sense (section 4) were difficult to make unequivocal but considerable circumstantial evidence was obtained. I) The tendencies that were reduced all involved approaching the other animal. 2) An hour's delay between injection and the introduction of the partner reduced the approach tendencies and increased the Escape of the saline controls: controls showed more Escape than rats given the small dose of chlorpromazine, though the larger dose induced yet more (test 7/2). 3) In Runs, I mglkg of chlorpromazine reduced Aggression and some other approach behaviour without increasing Flight from the partner. 4) If the animals were isolated three days before test instead of seven, it can be argued that the social "drives" had built up less. In these circum- stances, chlorpromazine did not, in fact, reduce Aggression and the form of Flight increased above the control level was Submission, not Escape. 5) Acute deprivation of food is said primarily to increase responsiveness to external stimuli and twelve hours deprivation antagonised the behavioural actions of I mg/kg of chlorpromazine. The drug was, nevertheless, effective in reducing overall aotivity. 6) There is some evidence (SILVERMAN, unpubl.) that barbiturates and lysergic acid diethylamide increase responsiveness. Certainly their effects are opposite to those of chlorpromazine. Reduced responsiveness is insufficient, however, to account for the large and quite consistent increases in Flight that occur in all tests above I mg/kg, and in all those up to this dose where no antagonistic effect can be plausibly suggested. The evidence for increased Flight, beyond any influence through loco- motion or general responsiveness, lies in: I) The degree and relative uniformity of the increase observed in the Escape category. The increase was usually in absolute as well as relative Behaviour XXVII 3</page><page sequence="34">34 A. P. SILVERMAN numbers and was apt to apply to all the elements included in the category. 2) The difficulty of substantiating the subjective distinction between avoidance and true escape. This may, of course, be inadequate observation; and there remains some evidence for the distinction on postural grounds and from the experiments in the runs. But if the distinction is important in the behaviour of the rat, the evidence for it might be expected to be clearer. 3) When the Escape category was not increased as much as usual there was a significant increase in Submission. 4) Benactyzine caused a much greater reduction in Aggression and Mating but no reduction in overall activity and little or no increase in Flight. There- fore, the observed increase in Flight with chlorpromazine was not a direct consequence, either behavioural or statistical, of the reduction in Aggression. 5) Amphetamine increased Escape as well as increasing overall activity, therefore chlorpromazine's increase is not a consequence of reduced activity. On the other hand, an increase in Flight alone is not sufficient either. An increase in Flight would be expected to give results something like those found for GK 26. A small dose would increase activity in general, without any reduction in Aggression as a whole, though Submission and Escape should be increased (in fact, GK 26 at i mg/kg appears not to reliably increase overt Flight, but Investigation instead). A larger dose would do what 4 mg/kg GK 26 actually does, namely to increase Escape greatly, to reduce Aggression and to depress the overall activity. The related GK 23 appears to raise Submission fairly specifically, at equivalent doses. The difference between 1 mglkg dose of chlorpromazine and GK 26 sug- gests that the former does not solely increase Flight but must also reduce responsiveness. The similarity between the two drugs at 4 mg/kg is striking. The suggestion that chlorpromazine increases Flight is, so far as I know, quite new. If social flight can be equated with non-social forms of avoidance or escape behaviour in rats (and at face value with behaviour associated with fear in man?) it contradicts the conclusions drawn in much of the literature. Yet interpretation of the drug's suppression of conditioned avoi- dance is very contradictory (see section 3 above) and there is evidence which, although decidedly ambiguous, is compatible with an interpretation of in- creased Flight. The evidence depends on making a single stimulus signal both food and shock simultaneously (GROSSMAN &amp; MILLER, I96I; GELLER et al., I962; RAY, I964). In the present study by "flight" is meant: in the first place, behaviour which increases the distance between one rat and another directly and with good orientation, and other elements statistically associated predominantly</page><page sequence="35">SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF RATS AND ACTION OF DRUGS 35 with this behaviour. In the second place, it was shown that chlorpromazine consistently increased this tendency and the attempt has been made to list and evaluate all the ways in which such an effect could occur. When these (locomotion, generalised sensory and motor abilities, generalised responsive- ness, the behaviour of other animals) have been estimated, one is left with evidence that some purely central factor governing the appearance of such behaviour is increased, the threshold of this specific tendency has been lowered. This central factor, if everything else has, in fact, been allowed for, may legitimately be labelled the Flight Drive. There need be little con- fusion when an author uses the same term for the observable tendency and for any drive, neurobehavioural mechanism, or other central motivational factor that can be deduced; the distinction should be apparent from the context. A drive can only be measured in terms of specific responsiveness, of course, i.e. by measuring the observable tendency shown in a given stimulus situation or, to state it more precisely, by comparing different individuals or different situations. However, there does appear to be a more general, non-specific responsiveness, in which a stimulus situation appropriate to one type of behaviour (e.g. deprivation of food, test I6) alters responsiveness to stimuli which one considers more appropriate to a different tendency (in the above example, flight from another animal). THORPE (1956) refers to this concept as a General Drive. In the present context, drugs or other experimental manipulations seem to affect general and specific responsive- ness (= general and specific drive) independently, or, at least, on a differ- ent scale. So in this case a difference in terminology is advisable. It is tempting to try to interpret drug effects in terms of a single action. Tn this case, it does not seem possible. A substance may well have a single biochemical action, but it does not follow that there is a single action at a neurophysiological level, still less at a behavioural one. Nevertheless, the hypotheses that become necessary to describe the be- havioural modes of action of drugs also throw some light on the behavioural mechanisms involved. SUMMARY i) Drug effects on the social behaviour of male laboratory rats are described in terms of changes in the occurrence both of the individual elements recognised in their reper- toire and of the whole categories into which these fall. Comparison of chlorpromazine in variations of an introduction situation and with several other drugs permitted detailed analysis of its actions. 2) Chlorpromazine at 0.5 to 4 mg/kg, reducing overall activity, particularly reduced tendencies of approach to another rat, Aggression, Mating and Investigation. Flight was increased, both Submission to and especially Escape from the other rat, while Exploration</page><page sequence="36">36 A. P. SILVERMAN and Maintenance (not primarily social) were rarely affected. The other rat correspond- ingly showed less Flight and more Exploration and Maintenance, without increasing Aggression. 3) Some of chlorpromazine's effects were less marked in cases where the behaviour of the saline controls might be expected to differ from that in the usual test situation. 4) GK 26, a pethidine derivative, increased Escape at 4 mg/kg, without reducing approach tendencies at a smaller dose. GK 23 seemed to increase Submission. 5) dl-Amphetamine (I to 5 mg/kg) increased activity and Escape, while reducing Aggression, eating and self-grooming. 6) Benactyzine (0.25 to 4 mg/kg) greatly reduced Aggression and Mating with little or no effect on Flight or activity. 7) Taking these results together, it is considered that chlorpromazine has three distinct actions -to reduce locomotion, to reduce the releasing (but not the orienting) effects of sensory stimuli, and to increase Flight.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG i) Wirkungen von Drogen auf das soziale Verhalten von Rattenmannchen werden beschrieben anhand der Wechsel im Auftreten sowohl der einzelnen Verhaltensanteile innerhalb eines Funktionkreises, als auch der wechselnden Aktivierung der Funktions- kreise als solche. Indem man Chlorpromazin in einer auf mancherlei Weise veranderten ersten Versuchssituation bot und mit den Wirkungen mehrerer anderer Drogen ver- glich, liessen sich die Wirkungen des Chlorpromazins ins einzelne analysieren. 2) 0.5-4 mg je kg Korpergewicht Chlorpromazin senkten die Aktivitat aller Arten, besonders die Bereitschaft, sich anderen Ratten zu naihern, sie anzugreifen, sich zu paaren und sie zu priifen. Erhoht war die Fluchtbereitschaft, besonders die sich der anderen Ratte zu unterwerfen und vor ihr zu fliehen, wahrend der Erkundungsdrang, Nahrungs- aufnahme, Sichputzen usw., also nicht in erster Linie soziale Handlungen, nur selten beeinflusst waren. Der nichtbehandelte Partner der Versuchsratte war entsprechend weni- ger fluchtbereit, erkundete und pflegte sich mehr, ohne dass seine Angriffsbereitschaft zunahm. 3) Einige der Chlorpromazinwirkungen waren weniger deutlich in Fallen, in welchen man wohl erwartet hatte, dass die nur mit Kochsalzlosung behandelten Kontrolltiere sich s hon anders verhielten als in der gewohnlichen Versuchssituation. 4) Das Pethidinderivat GK 26 in Dosen von 4 mg/kg erh6hte die Fluchtbereitschaft, ohne dass kleinere Dosen die Neigung, siclh anzunThern, verringerten. GK 23 schien die Unterwiirfigkeit zu erhohen. 5) I bis 5 mg/kg dl-Amphetamin erh6hte die Allgemeinaktivitat und Fluchtbereitschaft, wahrend Angriffsbereitschaft, Nahrungsaufnahme und Sichputzen abnahmen. 6) Benactizin (0.25 bis 4 mg/kg) dampfte Angriffs- und Paarungslust, liess jedoch Fluchtneigung und Allgemeinaktivitat fast beziehunsweise ganz unverandert. 7) Auf Grund aller dieser Ergebnisse Iasst sich sagen, dass Chlorpromazin dreierlei Wirkungen hat: es macht bewegungstrage, senkt die auslosenden, aber nicht die orientie- renden WNirkungen von Sinnesreizen und erhoht die Fluchtneigung.</page></plain_text>
