<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXILE OF DISINHERITED KIN IN KTU 1.12 AND KTU 1.23* J. DAVID SCHLOEN, Toronto FEW Ugaritic texts are more enigmatic than KTU 1.12 and KTU 1.23. Each of these presents problems of interpretation because of lacunae and a seeming lack of over- all coherence. It is not surprising, therefore, that scholars disagree over many details of translation and, for KTU 1.12 in particular, differ radically concerning the sense of the whole. Considered together, however, these two texts illuminate each other in an unexpected way. Warrant for comparison is given by the striking points of similarity between the myths contained in KTU 1.12 and KTU 1.23.1 In both texts, the patriarch 'El sends two women2 into the wilderness where their offspring, DEl's children3 and voracious eaters,4 roam the fringes of the desert.5 There are many differences between the two myths, of course, but this sequence of events is clearly basic to both and bespeaks a common theme. As a result, there are several points at which what is clear in one text can be used to elucidate the other. This is so because, as I shall argue below, KTU 1.12 and KTU 1.23 contain allomorphs of the same mythic theme, which I have called "the exile of disin- herited kin." This theme emerged from a Sitz im Leben familiar throughout the ancient Levant. It was rooted in the common, yet troubling, practice of expelling the patriarch's * I am grateful to F. M. Cross and J. Huehnergard for their helpful comments on this article. 1 John Gray ("The Hunting of Bacal: Fratricide and Atonement in the Mythology of Ras Shamra," JNES 10 [1951]: 153) notes that "the closest affini- ties of the text [KTU 1.12] are with SS [KTU 1.23] .... In both texts a leading motif is the proba- tionary period of sojourn in the desert, and in both cases El, in contrast to his benevolent inactivity in the AB cycle, is active in procreation. Beyond this, however, the analogy does not go .... " That the sojourn in the desert is merely "probationary" is entirely Gray's hypothesis, and, as we shall see, the analogy between the two texts is much deeper than he supposes. 2 In KTU 1.23 there are clearly two women, the un- named mothers of Thr and glm. In KTU 1.12 two names are given (tl' and dmgy) and the offspring (aklm) are plural, which suggests that two women are involved. It is true that "El addresses them in the sin- gular (col. 1, 11. 14-33), and this has led scholars to see only one woman with two names (see, for exam- ple, H. L. Ginsberg, "Baclu and His Brethren," Jour- nal of the Palestine Oriental Society 16 [1936]: 139; Gray, "Hunting of Bacal," p. 146, n. 8). But tls' is called maidservant of Yarib, while dmgy is the maid- servant of 'Atirat, and Yarib and 'Atirat are not usually a parallel pair; nor would plural offspring be expected from one woman. Perhaps the use of the singular in- dicates only that 'El speaks to each individually. 3 This is not explicit in KTU 1.12, but the maid- servants' offspring (the aklm) are clearly divine: ""El shall proclaim their name" (col. 1, 11. 28-29) and "on them is the face of Bacl" (col. 1, 1. 33). The reference to BaCl indicates not that BaCl is their father, but rather notes their kinship with the leading "son" of DEl's household, who later will fight the aklm, his "brothers" (col. 2, 11. 46-49). 4 The maidservant's offspring are called aklm ("de- vourers") and Cqqm ("renders") in KTU 1.12.1.26-27, while in KTU 1.23 the "beautiful gods," sons of DEl, are characterized as voracious eaters (11. 61-64). 5 The phrase pat mdbr in conjunction with the verb sd occurs in both texts: in KTU 1.12.1.35 (al- though mdbr is written mlbr as elsewhere in this text) and in KTU 1.23.68.

The disinherited, along with those who had been evicted from their homes through debt or other circumstances, formed what Michael Rowton has called the "parasocial el- ement" in ancient Near Eastern society and were known in second-millennium texts as Capiru or habiru.6 For Rowton, the parasocial element in a "dimorphic society" is the "social element intermediate between established tribal society and established urban society, not belonging fully either to one or the other."' Rowton's dichotomy between "tribal" and "urban" society (which he defines simply as "non-tribal") is perhaps too strict. More likely, there was a social continuum between sedentary and pastoral modes of life, both of which were in some sense "tribal" or kin-based.8 Nevertheless, the term "parasocial element" is apt because it describes those who had lost their share in their native patrimony and were forced to subsist in servile dependence or outright rebellion. This social type is found in a number of texts, including the biblical traditions of Ish- mael (Genesis 21) and Jephthah (Judges 11).9 The evidence of Akkadian and Egyptian texts indicates that the Capiru or habiru (SA.GAZ) were known throughout the Near East in the second millennium B.C.E. After a thorough survey of the data, Moshe Green- berg characterized them as uprooted, propertyless persons who found a means of subsistence for themselves and their families by entering a state of dependence in various forms. A contributory factor in their helplessness ap- pears to have been their lack of rights as foreigners in the places where they lived. In large numbers they were organized into state-supported bodies to serve the military needs of their localities. Others exchanged their services for maintenance with individual masters. The evidence of occu- pation lists ... points to their having been employed as hired labor-perhaps as seasonal agricul- tural laborers ... .In times of disorganization and weak central authority the local SA.GAZ/H. played a large role in the petty warfare between towns, and between local rulers (Mari, El-Amarna). Occasionally at such times some groups of SA.GAZ/H. seized the opportunity to break away from their masters and become independent freebooters.10 In the Bible, a picture of this social type may be found in the description of the dispos- sessed in Job 24: Behold, like wild asses [pera'im]"ll in the desert they go forth to their toil, seeking prey in the wilderness as food for their children. They gather their fodder in the field and they glean the vineyard of the wicked 6 Michael B.

A mighty warrior but the son of a harlot, he was evicted by his father's legitimate sons who said: "You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman" (Judg. 11:2). Jephthah fled to "the land of Tob" where propertyless men ( 3ndsitm reqim) collected around him and went raid- ing with him. Later he served as a military leader. 10 Moshe Greenberg, The Hab/piru, AOS 39 (New Haven, Conn., 1955), p. 88.

It is interesting that in ancient Near Eastern curses and maledictions the trespasser is frequently condemned to wander like a wild ass (Akk. sirrimu).

They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves; among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the wine presses, but suffer thirst (Job 24:5-11, RSV). Whether the term Cibri was originally related to Capiru is not important here. What- ever its name, the "parasocial element" no doubt persisted into the first millennium, as the preaching of the prophets makes clear (e.g., Amos 2, Micah 2).12 The familiar plight of the disinherited, which figured prominently in the literature of Israel, may have had a hitherto unrecognized place in the literature of Ugarit. Indeed, the just king at Ugarit is bluntly charged with the defense of the widow and the poor (KTU 1.16.6.45-48 [KRT]). More obliquely, however, the social tensions engendered between proprietors and their disenfranchised kin would have been a natural breeding ground for myths that functioned as etiologies or social charters explaining the status quo. Of course, it is difficult to determine the extent to which mythological texts provide clues to human social organization and social problems. G. S. Kirk argues from a com- parative perspective that there is no single function of myths in general or of any myth in particular.13 He suggests a working typology of (sometimes overlapping) mythical functions: (1) narrative and entertaining; (2) operative, iterative, and validatory (re- peated regularly on ritual or ceremonial occasions because their repetition is part of their value and meaning, either as magical, for example, the fertility myths, or as social charter or etiology confirming and authorizing customs and institutions); and (3) specu- lative and explanatory (addressing a problem, not to solve it but, somehow, to palliate it, for example, Gilgamesh). It seems likely that the Ugaritic myths, which are perme- ated with the language of kinship and exhibit the dynamics of social relations in a patri- archal household, reflect the customs and concerns inherent in a patrimonial society. In particular, the myths contained in KTU 1.12 and KTU 1.23 deal with expulsion from the patriarchal household and presumably reflect some social reality. My treatment of KTU 1.12 and KTU 1.23 is therefore guided by the perception that these texts share the theme of "the exile of disinherited kin." It is not unusual that one's sense of the overall theme of a text should affect one's interpretation. Ugaritic mytho- logical texts, because they are unvocalized and often fragmentary, are notoriously diffi- cult to interpret. A review of the literature quickly demonstrates that translators are influenced (consciously or not) by their understanding of the function of myths and the social concerns that prompt them. Nowhere is this more evident than in the various in- terpretations that have been proposed for KTU 1.12. H. L. Ginsberg, one of the first to work on this text, came closest to identifying the theme of "the exile of disinherited kin," although in his brief article he did not develop this idea. In 1936 he stated that [col. 1] relates the birth of gods who are according to all indications children of DIlu by TIS, alias Dgmiya [sic], the handmaid of Dllu and 'Atirtu, and therefore half-brothers of Baclu; who is DIlu's son by DAtirtu herself: and col. 2, 1. 36, still speaks of these "Devourers," whilst 2:47ff (q.v.) speak explicitly of Baclu's brethren, kinsmen and companions.14 'ane sauvage'," JCS 2 [1948]: 203-8) for a survey of the evidence. It appears that the wild ass is symbolic of the propertyless Capiru. 12 Note that it was not one's original social posi- tion but the loss of one's patrimony that could make one an Capiru. Idrimi of Alalakh, having lost his fam- ily seat in UJalab, joined the Capiru until he could return to conquer Alalakh (see A. Leo Oppenheim, trans., "The Story of Idrimi, King of Alalakh," in J. B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, 3d ed. [Princeton, 1969], p. 557). 13 G. S. Kirk, Myth: Its Meaning and Function in Ancient and Other Cultures (Cambridge, 1970), pp. 252-61. 14 Ginsberg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 139.</page><page sequence="4">212 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Ginsberg pointed to affinities with the story of Hagar. In Genesis 16 [Hagar] flees (in the duplicate narrative ch. 21 she is expelled) into the desert some time after becom- ing pregnant by Abram. In this account [Genesis 16], she returns to her mistress's home and gives birth there to Ishmael, who only becomes a desert marauder later on; but the version of our epic [KTU 1.12], according to which the gravid handmaid goes out into the desert and is delivered there of the Devourers, or Raveners, sounds more original."5 Although Ginsberg implies too direct a connection between KTU 1.12 and the story of Hagar and Ishmael, the parallel is difficult to ignore. The similarity is not likely due to literary dependence or a continuous tradition. Rather, both narratives are rooted in a common social phenomenon: the exile of the patriarch's lower-status son at the urging of his legitimate wife and children. The motivation is captured in Sarah's appeal to a reluctant Abraham: "Cast out this maidservant with her son; for the son of this maid- servant shall not be heir with my son Isaac" (Gen. 21:10). Theodor Gaster, writing in 1937, interpreted KTU 1.12 quite differently. Neglecting the social metaphor entirely, he saw it as a nature-myth, the theme of which is the discomfiture of Baal, god of the rains, and the onset of the dry season. Like his counterpart Adonis, Baal meets his fate at the hands of wild beasts, who are especially created for the purpose by the supreme deity El. They are desert demons, whom the god encounters whilst out hunting.16 This interpretation ignores important details in the narrative, especially the identifica- tion of the mothers of the "wild beasts" as maidservants in the household of 'El and their expulsion into the wilderness. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Devourers (aklm) were "especially created" by DEl to lure and destroy BaCl. Gaster tried to explain the expulsion of the maidservants as part of a devious conspiracy against BaCl, but Gins- berg's simpler solution seems preferable. The maidservants themselves (or their future offspring) had become objectionable and had to be sent away. In 1951 John Gray reviewed earlier treatments of KTU 1.12 and proposed another inter- pretation of it as "an etiological myth explaining and sanctioning the punishment or expi- ation of fratricide.""7 He rejected Ginsberg's suggestion of an analogy to the Hagar tradition, and saw no evidence for what Gaster took to be the seasonal downfall of BaCl. Focusing on column 2, Gray argued that the main theme of this text is "the blood-guiltiness of Bacal, who had unwittingly stained himself with the blood of his half-brothers, the brood of El and Atirat."'8 The closest biblical parallel would then be to the tradition of Cain and Lamech (Genesis 4). Gray is certainly correct in seeking a sociological setting for the myth and in pointing to the theme of fratricide in column 2 of the text. It is clearly stated that BaC1 is "clothed as with a garment in the blood of his brothers" (1. 47). As Arvid Kapelrud has noted, how- ever, "the trouble with Gray's interpretation is ... that it does not connect the first and the second halves of the text very well."19 Gray offers no convincing explanation for the ex- 15 Ibid., p. 141, n. 5. 16 Theodor H.

Like Gaster, he sup- poses that the "bovine monsters ... are intended, apparently, to lure BaCal-Hadad, who is a sanguine hunter."20 In his most recent treatment of KTU 1.12, Gray notes that the text opens with a complaint to El, who is addressed, whether deferentially or as an expression of natural affinity, as "father" of the speakers, that something "is eating them" (I, 9-11): 'il . abn our father El, kbd k Kisg. t-ikln It is eating our liver like a mole, tdn . km . mrm .tqrsn It is gnawing our breast like worms. The reason for the malease of the complainants is not known, but it had obviously to do with some action of Baal.21 It is not as obvious, as Gray asserts, however, that "some action of Baal" caused the complaint that provoked 'El deviously to send forth the maidservants as a means to lure BaCl to his demise. There is no evidence of a conspiracy against BaCl by 'El in this Ugaritic myth or any other. Indeed, 'El mourns Bacl's death in KTU 1.5.6. Given the parallel to the expulsion of Hagar, it is more likely that it is the "eating" (tikin) by the maidservants themselves or their voracious offspring (aklm) that presents a threat. F. Lokkegaard offered still another interpretation of KTU 1.12 in which he detected a power struggle between 'El and BaCl symbolized (in other texts) by Bacl's desire to have a house of his own. In the episode found in this text "El plans and executes a pun- ishment of Baal, not using violence, but cunning, leaving us with the impression of sa- gacity overcoming stupid force and greed, one of the favourite themes of fairy tales."22 This interpretation is open to the same criticism as Gaster's and Gray's. Nothing in the text suggests a conflict between 'El and BaCl, and a devious plot against BaCl is a tortu- ous explanation for the expulsion of the maidservants. Most recently, Arvid Kapelrud essayed a new interpretation of KTU 1.12 in terms of natural phenomena.23 He argued that the Devourers are a swarm of locusts who over- come BaCl, the god of fertility, after he has imparted some of his fertility to them. The Devourers are clearly described, however, as having "horns like bulls" and "humps like buffalo" (col. 1, 11. 30-32), and Kapelrud's attempt to make these lines descriptive of locusts is forced and farfetched, especially since BaCl himself (who is certainly not a locust) in the end falls "like a bull" and "like a buffalo" (col. 2, 11. 54-56). In my opinion, little progress has been made in the interpretation of KTU 1.12 since Ginsberg's treatment of it in 1936. Too little attention has been paid to the social situa- tion pictured in this myth, in which the patriarch 'El sends away two pregnant servant girls, one of whom is the maidservant of his consort 'Atirat. Furthermore, scholars have neglected the connection between the grievance expressed at the beginning of the text (a complaint about "devouring") and the characterization of the maidservants' offspring ("devourers"). Presumably 'Atirat and other members of the household are complaining to 'El that the servants he is fathering by female slaves are, or will be, "eating them out of house and home." In response, 'El sends two maidservants away, telling each to bear 20 Gray, "The Hunting of Bacal," pp. 146-47. 21 Idem, "Bacal's Atonement," p. 61. 22 F.

The story continues when BaCl, "son of Dagan" but also a "son" of DEI's household, encounters his exiled kinsmen (in animal form) while hunting on the "fringes of the desert." BaCl himself may be in the form of a bull, judging by the de- scription of him in col. 2, 11. 54-56.24 In any case, a battle ensues in which it appears that BaCl takes the offensive and is the victor: "Seven years the god fulfilled.. . for he is clothed as with a garment in the blood of his brothers" (col. 2, 11. 45-47). It seems that BaCl must make atonement for the death of his kinsmen, as Gray has suggested. The story concludes with the arrival of the sr ahyh,25 whom Gray takes to be M6t, coming to exact satisfaction for the blood of his kinsmen.26 At this point BaCl falls "like a bull" (col. 2, 11. 54-55). The text closes with what appears to be a description of a libation ritual.27 Despite the wide variety of proposed interpretations it should be recognized that the translation possibilities are limited in most places in KTU 1.12. On this there is a mea- sure of agreement among scholars. But it is clear that at crucial points the choice of a particular cognate or vocalization among several possibilities is determined by the translator's sense of the meaning of the whole. In that case, what results is less a simple translation than the application of a model to fragmentary data in order to test its "good- ness-of-fit." This is certainly true of the treatment of the text that follows. Nevertheless, it is my contention that the guiding theme of "the exile of disinherited kin" fits the data better than any other so far proposed. A vocalization and translation that proceeds with this theme in mind yields a reading of the text that makes better sense of the whole. KTU 1.12 (column 1) (lines 1-7 fragmentary) ka-ma saahri [bata]latuna28 Like the dawn are our maidens, ka-ma qadmi [ca]badana29 like the east (wind?) are our servants. 9ilu abana O DEl our father! 24 In the Middle Kingdom Egyptian story of Sinuhe, the combat between Sinuhe and the chal- lenger of Retenu is likened to a battle between bulls (11. 120-24; see Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. I [Berkeley, 1973], p. 227). Simi- larly, Gilgamesh and Enkidu fight like bulls in the Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet II vi 11-20). 25 "The chief (?) of his brothers"; but cf. the di- vine name mt.wgr ("Radiant MOt" [?]) in KTU 1.23.8. 26 Gray, "The Hunting of Bacal," p. 154. 27 The form Ptk in col. 2, 11. 59-61, is probably the ? of ntk; cf. Heb. natak (Hiph. hittik) and Akk. nataku. 28 The lacuna permits two letters (cf. Heb. bet4la;; Akk. batultu). Although the reconstruction proposed here is not certain, it is probable that the first few lines of this text describe the situation that prompted the expulsion of the maidservants and their unborn voracious offspring. 29 The lacuna permits one letter and "our ser- vants" is a suitable parallel to "our maidens" in what is clearly a parallel line (?hr I qdm). The plural forms batalatu and Cabadama would then supply the sub- ject of the plural verbs tikln and tqrsn a few lines later. These verbs might be taken as 3fs were it not for what appears to be a plural mrm in 1. 11 (unless the final m be enclitic). That the final n of [bt]ltn and [C]bdn is the lcp pronominal suffix is suggested by the phrase il abn, clearly "DEl our father," whom the speakers are addressing. If qdm refers to the wither- ing "east wind" then the comparison to voracious servants is appropriate. The mention of ghr is inter- esting given the other similarities to KTU 1.23.</page><page sequence="7">THE EXILE OF DISINHERITED KIN IN KTU 1.12 AND KTU 1.23 215 kabida30 ka-'isi ta'kulana Like fire31 they devour (our) wealth. tadana ka-ma MRM32 taqru3s.na33 like.., .they nibble our substance.34 9ilu yizhaqu35 bi-ma libbi 'El laughs in his heart, wa-yagmudu bi-ma kabidi he chortles36 in his liver. ziji37 9atti "You go forth, la-TLS 9amatu Yarihi O TLB, maidservant of Yarih, la-DMGY 9amatu 9Atirati O DMGY, maidservant of 'Atirat! qahi kussi9dnaki38 Take your (birth)stool, hidgaki39 huttiliki40 your baggage, your swaddling bands, wa-zi'i bi-9dlina41 and go forth from our household (?). tukki-mi42 bi-toki madbari43 Be oppressed in the midst of the wilderness 9ili SIY4 of the god of desolation (?). 30 A more literal translation of kbd as "liver" par- allel to tdn ("our breasts") is possible, but the meta- phorical use of these terms better suits the context. 31 One would expect igt as elsewhere in Ugaritic, but most scholars have agreed that the form is' is not impossible (cf. Heb. 'is) and that the image of de- vouring fire is quite appropriate (cf. Amos 1). John Huehnergard (Ugaritic Vocabulary in Syllabic Tran- scription, Harvard Semitic Studies 32 [Atlanta, 1987], p. 63) argues on the basis of a syllabic writing of the word that Ug. ist is probably to be vocalized 'is'itu, "i.e., the Proto-Semitic base *is' plus an (ab- stract?) ending *-it." In KTU 1.12.10, then, a form without the -it ending is used, or else the final t is ac- cidentally omitted before the following word tikln. Ginsberg, however, renders is' as "mole" and trans- lates 11. 9-13 as follows: "[ i the body (?) of our father (?) 'Ilu. The (?) inward parts she devours like a mole (?), the (?) fat she nibbles like a ferret (?). 'Ilu laughed in his heart and exulted in his inward parts" (Ginsberg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 140). Ginsberg was troubled by the picture of fire consum- ing "inward parts" and so adduced Mishnaic Hebrew 'swt ("mole"), in which he is followed by Gray ("fBacal's Atonement" but not in idem, "The Hunting of Bacal"). Either way it is clear that the devouring is distressing and presumably it is the cause of the ex- pulsion of the maidservants and their voracious un- born offspring. 32 No convincing reading of this word has yet been advanced. Gray ("Bacal's Atonement," p. 62, n. 6) compares mrm to Heb. rmh and suggests "worms, corruption," but there is no evidence for an m-preformative with this meaning. 3 Cf. Arb. qarasa, "to pinch, nip"; Akk. kardsu, "to pinch off." 3 Most scholars translate literally "our breast(s)" (see, for example Lokkegaard, "The House of Baal," p. 11; Kapelrud, "Baal and the Devourers," p. 320; Gray, "Bacal's Atonement," p. 62; Andre Caquot, Maurice Sznycer, and Andr6e Herdner, Textes ou- garitiques, vol. 1, Mythes et Idgendes [Paris, 1974], p. 335) or, by extension, "fat" (Ginsberg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 140; Gray, "Hunting of Bacal,"' p. 148; cf. Arb. tadina, "to be fleshy"). 35 Here, as elsewhere in this text, z is written for expected s. 36 Meaning inferred from context. 37 Again, z for expected s &lt; *d. 38 Presumably, the -dn- element is diminutive (Gins- berg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 141; Gray, "Hunting of Bacal," p. 148, n. 23). 39 With previous translators (for example, Gins- berg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 141); cf. Arb. hid4, "load, burden"; hiddja, "woman's litter." 40Cf. Heb. htl, as noted by all commentators. 41 Ug. "tent" is usually written ahl, but the He- brew evidence suggests that at some point *Jahl- &gt; *Jal-, pronounced [O61] after the Canaanite shift and so written 6dhAl in MT (J. Huehnergard, personal communication). Given the non-standard orthography used elsewhere in this text, it may be that 'al was written for etymological 'ahl, due to the loss of the h in pronunciation or due to Akk. influence (cf. Akk. dlu, which can mean "village, manor, estate" [CAD s.v.]). This reading suits the sense of the passage bet- ter than those previously suggested. Ginsberg ("Baclu and His Brethren," p. 142, n. 7) translates "go forth into the plain of Tkm (?)" but provides no convincing cognates for aln meaning "plain." Gray (followed by Caquot et al., Textes Ougaritiques, vol. 1 [Paris, 1974], p. 338) suggests "oak" (Heb. 'lwn) but admits that "it is not easy to understand oaks in the desert" (Gray, "Bacal's Atonement," p. 62, n. 14). His earlier proposal ("Hunting of Bacal," p. 148; followed by Kapelrud, "Baal and the Devourers," p. 320) was "couch in pain," associating tkm with Arb. waka, "couch" (following Gaster, "Harrowing of Baal," p. 45), and adducing Arb. 'alam, "pain." In his later treatment, however, he admitted that an n/m corre- spondence is unlikely. 42 The form tkm is difficult, but taking it as a D- passive imperative with enclitic suits the sense of the passage (cf. Heb. tak, "injury, oppression"). 43 Written mlbr. 44 Cf. Heb. sa a, "become a ruin"; ?e"iyyd, "a ruin" (Isa. 24:12).

"be hired, bought"; cf. Heb. kadr, "to buy"; Arb. kry, "to hire, employ." In two of the four biblical uses of this root (Job 6:27 and Hos. 3:2), it is a human being who is bought. Most previ- ous translators, taking Cpr as "soil, dust" (parallel to ugrm; cf. Akk. ugaru, "plain"), render kry as "dig"; see, for example, Ginsberg ("Baclu and His Breth- ren," p. 142): "Dig, O handmaid, the soil; the might of the hand(s). . . "; Lokkegaard ("House of Baal," p. 11): "dig with your elbows in the dust, and with the bones of (your) hand in the field"; Gray ("Bacal's Atonement," p. 63): "Dig a pit in the earth, O maiden, / Lay firm hold on the ground"; and Caquot et al. (Textes Ougaritiques, vol. 1, p. 339): "Creuse (avec) l'avant-bras la terre, / (avec) I'os de la main (creuse) le sol." While this interpretation is possible it is hard to see how digging suits the sense of the passage. It can hardly be "the preparation of a natu- ral birthstool" (Gray, "Bacal's Atonement," p. 63, n. 16), since the maidservant is to take her ksan with her. It is to be expected, however, that the exiled maidservant must sell her services elsewhere in order to survive. 46 It is true that all other instances of Cpr in myth- ological texts occur in parallel to ars and must be rendered "dust, earth." In this case, however, ars is not present and the supposed parallel to ugrm mean- ing "plain" does not hold up (see n. 48). If kry means "be hired" and ugrm means "hirelings," then Cpr may be read as Capiru without difficulty. 47 Cf. Heb. Casam, "mighty, numerous" (esp. of people). Note the following expression in the Amarna letters: da-an-nu LUSA.GAZME? muhhi-nu, "strong are the Capiru against us" (EA 299 and EA 305). Compare the Egyptian fear of Hebrew strength in Exodus 1: "the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew ex- ceedingly strong (Csm)" (Exod. 1:7-10). 48 Cf. Akk. agaru, "to hire, rent (esp. people)" (CAD s.v.); Arb. 'ajara, "to pay, hire." Most previ- ous interpreters have taken ugrm to be parallel to Cpr, "dust, soil," and connected it with Akk. ugaru, "plain, arable land" (see, for example, Gray, "Hunt- ing of Bacal," p. 149, n. 32). It is clear, however, that ugaru is a Sumerian loanword in Akkadian (from a-gar) and does not come from a Semitic root at all (AHw. s.v.). Unless we have here a direct borrowing from Akkadian (or Sumerian), it seems best to con- nect ugrm with the well-attested Semitic root 'gr and read "hirelings," which may then be taken to be par- allel to Cpr = capiru. 49 Cf. Heb. hwl; Akk. halu. 50 A translation involving the kneeling of the maidservant has been adopted by almost all commen- tators, but in that case one would expect the caus- ative ;. The more positive sentiment, "they shall bless you," is in keeping with the parallel line, ""El shall proclaim their name." 51 Cf. Arb. Cqq, "to rend." 52 The verb ypCr (probably singular) indicates that the subject should be singular with enclitic m. 53 Cf. Eth. wahaya (Ginsberg, "Baclu and His Brethren," p. 144). 54 Written mlbr but clearly identical in meaning to mdbr. 55 The final 'a indicates the "volitive," which is also proposed for the parallel verb ymgy in the pre- ceding line. 56 Meaning inferred from context.</page><page sequence="9">THE EXILE OF DISINHERITED KIN IN KTU 1.12 AND KTU 1.23 217 The second column of KTU 1.12 is even more fragmentary than the first. As all previ- ous scholarly treatments make clear, however, the story continues with a battle between BaCl and his "brothers" the Devourers in which it appears that Bacl takes the offensive and prevails. The question of whether Bacl must then make atonement for fratricide is not relevant here. The main point is that hostility exists between Bacl, a person of high status in the household of DEl and heir to the patrimony, and the disinherited children of DEl. At the same time a relationship of kinship is recognized and there is apparently an obli- gation not to kill the dispossessed wanderer. The parallel observed by Gray to the stories of Cain and Lamech (Genesis 4) is quite striking.57 Cain, condemned to be a fugitive and a wanderer, receives a "mark" from Yahweh "lest any who came upon him should kill him" (Gen. 4:15). Sevenfold vengeance will be exacted on the one who slays him, and Lamech boasts: "If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold" (Gen. 4:24). Compare KTU 1.12.2.44-49: ?bc.snt.il.mla Seven years the god fulfilled, wtmn.nqpnt.Cd and eight cycles of time; klbs.km lp'.dm a[ih] for he is clothed as with a garment in the blood of his brothers, km.all.dm.aryh as with a robe in the blood of his kinsmen. kibct.lhbcm. ahh.ym[?] For (?) seventy-seven of his brothers [he shall die (?)], wtmnt. ltmnym and (for) eighty-eight. [Or, Seven for seventy of his brothers ... , and eight for eighty.] The uneasy relationship between proprietors and their disinherited kin is also evident in KTU 1.23. This text appears to describe a ritual and gives directions for the celebra- tion of a feast. The frequent references to grapes, vines, and terraces58 suggest a vintage festival. This text also narrates the birth of the "beautiful gods" (ilm ncmm), the astral deities "Dawn" (shr) and "Dusk" (9lm). They are fathered by the patriarch DEl, who copulates with two unnamed women. The action takes place at the gp ym (1. 30), usually rendered "the shore of the sea." In keeping with the vintage motif, however, it may be that gp ym denotes the "slopes by the sea" or the "slopes of Yamm," that is, vine ter- races (cf. Heb. Cal gappe merome qdret [Prov. 9:3]; Syr. geptpd', "vault, dome"; Arab. janif "humpbacked"). In any case, it is there that DEl seduces the two women, who re- main unidentified. Apparently, however, they are referred to by the term mgtCltm in 1. 31, as several scholars have suggested.59 In the course of his lovemaking, DEl takes the mstCltm into his house (11. 35-36), which indicates that the term refers to his sexual partners. But no convincing interpretation of mstCltm has so far been offered.60 The form appears to be a feminine dual participle, which would suitably denote the two women. Unfortunately, a number of roots are possible. Given a context involving wine and 57 Gray, "Hunting of Bacal," p. 155. 58 The ?dmt in 1. 10 probably denotes a vine ter- race (see Lawrence E. Stager, "The Archaeology of the East Slope of Jerusalem and the Terraces of the Kidron," JNES 41 [1982] 111-21). 59 Marvin Pope ("Ups and Downs in El's Amours," UF 11 [1979]: 702), for example, takes mstcltm to be "two torches," which were "understood to represent a pair of passionate females." 60 See M. Dietrich and O. Loretz, "UG. M?TCLT (KTU 1.23: 31.35.36)," UF 9 (1977): 342-43, for a review of the literature.</page><page sequence="10">218 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES grapes, however, the appropriate root may be '11 (cf. Heb. call6t, "gleaning [of grapes and olives]; C'difla, "wantonness"), which has not yet been proposed as far as I know. The word might then be vocalized as an St feminine dual participle, i.e., multacillate^mi (acc.) or the like, and would mean "the two gleaning women." In the ancient Levant, destitute women were forced to glean and often became sexual prey (cf. Ruth 2:9). Per- haps these women, the mothers of the minor deities Dawn and Dusk, were pictured as dependent servants in the household of DEl, seduced by him in the course of a drunken wine festival. The difficult couplet in 1. 31 of KTU 1.23 (repeated in 11. 35-36) could then be translated as follows: yiqqahu ilu multacillate^mi DEl takes two gleaners, mustacillatemi li-ra'si 9aggani two gleahers who are near the head of the (wine) krater. Whether or not this interpretation is correct, there is a clear parallel between these women who are sent into the wilderness (1. 65) with their voracious offspring61 (foster children of DAtirat) in KTU 1.23 and their counterparts (one of whom is the "maidser- vant of DAtirat") in KTU 1.12. At first glance, however, there seems to be little similarity between the bovine children of DEl in KTU 1.12 and the astral deities of KTU 1.23. But in a much later text, 1 Enoch 86, a vision is recounted in which a star fell down from heaven but (managed) to rise and eat and to be pastured among those cows .... Once again I saw a vision, and I observed the sky and behold, I saw many stars descending and cast- ing themselves down from the sky upon that first star; and they became bovids among those calves and were pastured together with them, in their midst.62 Paul Hanson (although he does not deal specifically with this passage) has argued that 1 Enoch reflects "an unbroken stream of influence from mythic structures of thought which ultimately trace their parentage to the great near eastern religious systems of the second millennium."63 In his study of the "rebellion-in-heaven" theme of 1 Enoch 6-11, Hanson adduces evidence of this theme from the Hurrian Kumarbi, and Ullikummi myths, the Ugaritic myth of "Ashtar the Rebel," Hesiod's Theogony, and the description of "Helel ben-Sahar" in Isaiah 14. He concludes: We thus recognize the coexistence of two allomorphs of the rebellion-in-heaven myth, one describing astral rebels, the other zoimorphic or anthropomorphic rebels associated with the storm and sea.64 Although Hanson does not cite it, the passage in 1 Enoch 86, in which astral beings (whom we may equate with the fallen astral "angels" of 1 Enoch 6-11) become bulls who take to pasture, provides a direct connection between the "astral" and "zodmor- phic" allomorphs of this mythic theme. 61 The young gods' appetite is apparently what provokes their expulsion in KTU 1.23 just as I have suggested was the case in KTU 1.12. Marvin Pope, for example, suggests that the "gluttonous godlings with prodigious mouths and insatiable appetites are not merely teratoid but a threat to the food supply and hence have to be banished . . . Both mother(s) and children are remanded to the Desert Qadesh, like Hagar and Ishmael, Gen. 16:14" (Pope, "Ups and Downs," pp. 707-8). Pope does not develop further the Hagar-Ishmael parallel which Ginsberg ("Baclu and His Brethren," p. 141, n. 5) noted. 62 Translated by E. Isaac, in James H. Charles- worth, ed., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, vol. 1 (Garden City, New York, 1983), p. 63. 63 Paul D.

Women are expelled with their divine offspring, who in one text appear in animal form and in the other as astral beings. It is possible that these texts contain zo6morphic and astral allomorphs, respectively, of the same mythic theme. On the other hand, neither text speaks of a rebellion against DEl, the head of the pan- theon. The grand "rebellion-in-heaven" theme seems to be absent here, and the connec- tion to the myths that Hanson cites is obscure. There does, however, appear to be a connection in Ugaritic mythology between ?ahar and ?alim of KTU 1.23 and the rebel- lious astral deity CAttar (KTU 1.6), who is to be identified with Venus, the morning and evening star. There have been a number of scholarly attempts to untangle the evidence relating to cAttar65 and to the astral rebel Helel ("the Shining One") ben-?ahar who ap- pears in Isaiah 14 with parallels in the Greek myth of Phaeton.66 Richard Clifford, not- ing (with other scholars) that ?ahar and ?alim appear to be hypostases of cAttar as Venus, has suggested that the two sons of DEl in KTU 1.23 are rebels: The two young gods are put out to pasture, but their voracious appetites make it necessary for them to go to more fruitful surroundings, where there is plenty of food and wine. A guard lets them in and feeds them. One could conjecture that these two gods are rebel gods, breaking into the "field of El," which is mentioned earlier in the text.67 In this text, the two gods are not characterized as rebels, however. Attention should be paid to the character of the exiles' mothers and the circumstances of their expulsion. If there is an underlying parallelism between KTU 1.23 and KTU 1.12, then the fact that the mothers are dependent servants (which is highlighted in KTU 1.12), and the fact that the voracious appetite and violence of their offspring prompts their expulsion point to a social setting for this myth somewhat more domestic and intimate than the scene of po- litical revolt that lies behind the large-scale "rebellion in heaven." On the other hand, the mythic theme of the "rebellion in heaven" may itself have flowered on a grand scale only quite late. What appears as a battle between armies of angels in apocalyptic litera- ture is couched in terms of household kinship rivalry in second-millennium texts. Frat- ricide or parricide, and not regicide, is the issue in the Hurrian and Ugaritic myths and in Hesiod's Theogony. But this is to be expected if second-millennium political struc- tures were closer to what Max Weber called "patrimonial" regimes than to professional- ized bureaucratic states. In a patrimonial state the kingdom is simply the patriarchal household writ large, and the struggle for power is analogous to the factional rivalry for property and privilege between patrilaterals in extended patrilineages that is so well known in Middle Eastern anthropology. Thus in Ugaritic mythology the stories of in- ternecine warfare between Bacl and his "brothers" in the household of El-who is both patriarch and king-are not simply a picture of days gone by but a living tradition re- flecting the workings of a complex patrimonial state in which the struggles between 65 See Gray, "The Desert God CATTR in the Liter- ature and Religion of Canaan," JNES 8 (1949): 72- 83; also Andre Caquot, "Le Dieu CAthtar et les textes de Ras Shamra," Syria 35 (1958): 45-60. 66 P.

The tradition of "the exile of disinherited kin" in particular would strike a chord with Ugaritians of all ranks. Political rebellion-the attempt to usurp the patrimony of the rightful heir-and the dispossession of rebels, pictured in the mythic theme of the "re- bellion in heaven," were simply another form of the familiar household struggles that resulted in "the exile of disinherited kin." Indeed, as the Amarna letters make clear, the typical rebellion in Late Bronze Age Canaan involved small-scale skirmishes fought by a city prince defending his patrimony against the disaffected and rapacious Capiru (many of whom had recently been his subjects) who roamed the fringes of the wilderness. Canaan in the Amarna period, however, was an extreme case of social breakdown. In KTU 1.23 the Capiru-type, the "parasocial element," is symbolized by the astral deities Dawn and Dusk who are characterized as voracious but also beautiful. As children of the patriarch, the kinship bond extends far enough that they may demand entrance, seek- ing work and rations with their kin at harvest time when agricultural laborers are needed (KTU 1.23.67-76). The myth of the "Birth of Dawn and Dusk" is therefore appropriate to a ritual-cum-etiology recited at harvest time. In KTU 1.12, the Capiru are enemies of the legitimate son their "brother," but the kinship bond obliges him not to kill them. In both the zo6morphic and the astral allomorphs of this mythic theme, then, sons of the patriarch are disinherited but remain kin.</page></plain_text>
