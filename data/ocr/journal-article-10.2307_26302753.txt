<plain_text><page sequence="1">192 Dorothy F. Zeligs Moses and Pharaoh: A Psychoanalytic Study of their Encounter There is a quality of awesomeness about the personality and accomplishments of Moses that tends to place him, in popular fantasy, beyond the realm of mortal man, dangerously close to the Divinity itself. Yet we are repeatedly reminded both in the Scriptures and in post-biblical legend, not only of his human origins but of his human failings. This seemingly contradictory image of Moses has an understandable psychological basis. I shall try to show that within the psyche of Moses a conflict existed between two forces that pulled him in opposite direc tions. On the one hand, there was a strong wish for omnipotence, with the accompanying sense of being special, while on the other, were deep and painful feelings of inadequacy. We shall see that this struggle finds repeated but disguised expression in the biblical text, as though inadvertently revealed through the words of the hero himself. He could quite openly plead his slowness of speech, but more hidden within him were the long ings for a sense of power that would make him feel Godlike. Earlier Indications of Conflict The presence of these conflictful tendencies can be detected in the life of Moses starting from early days. In a previous study (38) I interpreted the story of his rescue from the Nile River and adoption by the daughter of Pharaoh (11:1-10)* as express * References to biblical quotations are from Exodus. ing a daydream of the youthful Moses, projected back to infancy, in which he reveals discontent with his own situation in life, stemming, in part, from oedipal feelings, and tries to improve his lot in a typical family romance fantasy (9; 35). A familiar extra-biblical legend portrays the child Moses in the royal palace, reaching up, one day, from his foster-mother's arms and removing the crown from Pharaoh's head, placing it upon his own. He is saved from death by the Angel Gabriel, disguised as one of the wise men consulted in this portentous</page><page sequence="2">Moses and Pharaoh 193 situation. In the ensuing test suggested by Gabriel to see i£ the child could recognize the difference between a bright jewel and a glowing ember, thus determining if the act had been inten tional, Moses burns his fingers when the angel guides his hand toward the coal. His impediment of speech is attributed, in this legend, as resulting when he raises the injured fingers to his mouth, burning his lips and tongue (17, II, p. 272). As a young man, Moses slays an Egyptian taskmaster who was beating a Hebrew slave and has to take flight from Egypt when his life is sought by Pharaoh (11:11-15), thus making the latter a threatening figure on a personal basis. After the theophany of the burning bush, when Moses is returning to Egypt from Midian to fulfill the mission of liberat ing his brethren, the newly-consecrated prophet is attacked during the night while resting at a lodging-place on the borders of Egypt. The biblical narrative says that God Himself is about to slay Moses when he is saved by the intervention of his wife Zipporah, who circumcises one of their sons as an act of expiation (IV:24-26). My interpretation of this bizarre event (40) is that it is an intrapsychic experience, either a nightmare or an hysterical attack, stemming from unconscious fears of retaliation. For Moses had been anticipating the coming con frontation with Pharaoh and preparing to threaten him with the slaying of the monarch's firstborn. This thought, which in volved both identification with the omnipotence of God and contained personal motives of revenge, probably aroused anxiety and guilt in Moses, making him fear punishment from the Father, here a nightmarish composite of both the good and the bad images, God and Pharaoh. The Trauma of Failure The first actual confrontation of Moses with Pharaoh re sults in disappointment and trauma. The request of Moses and Aaron that the Hebrew slaves be allowed to go into the desert for a three-day period to make sacrifices to their God is quickly and sternly rejected by the Egyptian ruler. He reproaches the two leaders, accusing them of turning the minds of the people away from their work, and encouraging idleness. The task masters are forthwith commanded to make the burdens of the</page><page sequence="3">194 Dorothy F. Zeligs slaves heavier, requiring them to search the fields for their own straw and yet produce the same quota of bricks as before. This was evidently an impossible task and for its failure, the Hebrew officers who supervised the work were beaten. They complained bitterly to Moses and Aaron, declaring that the two had put a sword into Pharaoh's hands with which to slay them. Moses turns to God and complains in his turn, asking '. . . why is it that Thou hast sent me? For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all (V:22-23).' These words of reproach to God are bitter ones, spoken in much the same tone and with the same complaint that the Hebrew officers had spoken to Moses himself. God answers reassuringly, saying: ' Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of the land (VI: 1).' This response, especially the opening words, do not have the sound of Divinity speaking. They resemble more the ex pression of an angry man—Moses himself. The second part of the statement has an ambiguous quality. By whose strong hand will he let them go? God generally does not hesitate to refer to His own might. Why then the indefinite article, " by a strong hand "? Disappointed and perturbed, does Moses wish to punish the ruler of Egypt with his own strong hand? If so, such a wish must be concealed by ambiguity. Repudiated by his own people and spurned by Pharaoh, Moses may have suffered a loss of self-esteem and sought thus to restore his injured narcissism. This symbolism of the strong hand, an expression used fre quently in the Bible to denote the power of God both to punish and to save, could have had a particular appeal for Moses, who evidently had impulses of a similar nature. The same metaphor is employed at the earlier theophany of the burning bush and there too, it results in an ambiguity of the text. God says in the course of His pronouncements, ' And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand (111:19).' Here also the possessor of the mighty hand is unclear. My view is that, in this instance, it belonged to Pharaoh, thus establishing him as a foe worthy of the powerful hand of God, who in the following verse declares, ' And I will put forth my</page><page sequence="4">Moses and Pharaoh 195 hand and smite Egypt . . Thus Moses, in identification with God, matches his power against that of Pharaoh (39, p. 393), an attitude of personal competitiveness which must be repressed. The wish to be like God comes briefly to the surface again in the second situation under discussion. And suddenly, there is a complete break in the context. The following verse begins on an entirely different note: " And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: I am the Lord: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty (El Shaddai), but as to my name (Yahweh) I was not known to them (VI:2-3)." God now repeats his promise to deliver the children of Israel from bondage and instructs Moses to convey this mes sage to them. God thus introduces himself anew, as though no previous communication had taken place. Even traditional biblical com mentary can find no satisfactory explanation for this non sequitor and sees the content only in relation to the promise of redemption made at the burning bush (20, II, p. 66). The school of Higher Biblical Criticism also makes this association to the earlier theophany but explains these verses as a parallel account, coming from a different literary source and placed here by an editor at a later date (8). But neither com mentary explains why the material was introduced at this par ticular point where it disrupts the continuity of the text. This distinction in the names by which God was known to the forefathers of Israel has played an important role in the history of biblical exegesis. It became a significant factor for determining the various literary and historical sources into which the Pentateuch was divided by scholars of this school of thought. Their reasoning was that if God was not known to the Patriarchs as Yahweh and the name is commonly found in the narratives of that period, then the Genesis account must have been put together from different sources, some of which would have been written after Exodus VI:3, where this revelation is made to Moses (36; 8, p. XI, 20, II, p. 67). From a psychological viewpoint, the situation can be in terpreted differently. It is assumed that communication with God, when viewed as an intrapsychic experience, takes place in an altered state of consciousness (39; 3; 25). A characteristic</page><page sequence="5">196 Dorothy F. Zeligs sequence of dynamics in terms of Moses seems to take the form of a transitory merging with God, a rise in anxiety, and a reactive withdrawal. If momentarily, Moses confuses God's strong hand with his own, if briefly, he merges his own identity with that of God, especially in a punitive role, anxiety both about this loss of self (24) and fear of retaliation for competitiveness with God must follow. Comparable to a break in the associations of an analysand when there is an increase in anxiety, the discontinuity of the text may represent a defensive measure. It is conjectured that Moses separates himself from God, withdrawing some of his libido from the Divine Imago (Ego Ideal), into his own ego in this intersystemic struggle (19). The next words in the text are: " And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: I am the Lord," thus clearly defining and delineating their separate identities. It is during such a period of withdrawal that Moses experi ences a sense of relief at his separateness but also a renewed feeling of aloneness and inadequacy. He can tolerate neither too much closeness with the Deity nor too much distance. At this point, it seems that reassurance is needed. It is not enough now to hear the familiar pronouncement that the God of his patri archal fathers was addressing him. Moses had to know God in a special way, a need that must have been invested with strong emotions of a highly narcissistic nature. So God now reveals Himself to his prophet by a new name, which, according to the fantasy of Moses, had not been known to the revered forefathers, thus giving him a distinction, a sense of being special, that even they had lacked. The sequence of events does indeed bear a striking simi larity to the theophany of the burning bush. Both involve the mission of liberating his people and the reluctant attitude of Moses, suffering from a lack of confidence in himself to under take the task. On both occasions, the matter of God's name is brought up. At the burning bush, it is Moses who asks God by what name the Deity should be called when asked by the Hebrews who had sent him. God then replies, ' I AM THAT I AM; and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you (III: 14).' Evidently, the name by which God was known had great</page><page sequence="6">Moses and Pharaoh 197 meaning for Moses. On both occasions, the subject is intro duced at a point when Moses retreats from identification with God and is left with feelings of inadequacy, unsure of his own identity. If God and Moses were separate entities, then the old problem of " Who am I? " would reassert itself. This question is again projected onto God, who first describes himself in familiar terms and then introduces himself by a new name. Names had special meanings in antiquity. Frequently, they expressed the essence of the bearer (27). Knowing God by a special name may also have implied a greater degree of fa miliarity and closeness for Moses (39, p. 387). Some significance must also be attributed to the specific names of the Deity. El Shaddai (God is Mighty), is clearly men tioned as having been known to the Patriarchs. Interestingly, it is this attribute of God, His omnipotence, from which Moses had been retreating, in guilt and anxiety. Omnipotence was the right and privilege of father figures only. So Moses now meets God as Yahweh, the Ineffable Name, the most sacred by which the Deity was known. Rabbinic tradition associates this designation of God with that aspect which denotes his more personal relationship to man, especially in the role of One who forgives and shows mercy (20, I, pp. 16-17; 7). Thus, in terms of the present situation, Moses turns from the God of Might to the God of Mercy who will forgive the prophet's transgression in the wish for omnipotence, which had a competitive quality with the Deity Himself. At the same time, in a fashion that is clinically familiar, the narcissism which is withdrawn from sharing in God's omnipotence finds expression in a substitute form, knowing God by a special name. It may be that this name was repressed in the memory of Moses, and indeed, in the memory of his people, and that it now rises from repression and is experienced as new. Indeed, this entire theophany, with its repetitive flavor, could be under stood as a déjà vu experience (11): I have been there before. A further association can be made. The name of Moses' mother is Yochebed, God is My Glory (20, II, p. 72). It is the only recorded instance when a personal name is formed from Yahweh before the time of Moses (23). Buber wonders if some early family tradition concerning this name might be involved (6, pp. 49-51).</page><page sequence="7">198 Dorothy F. Zeligs The name of Yahweh is thus definitely associated with the mother image in regard to Moses. Psychoanalytically, this rela tionship is particularly understandable in the circumstance under discussion. In his hour of distress and alienation, Moses experi ences the Deity, not only as the God of his fathers but also as embodying the aspect of the comforting mother. Such an asso ciation would normally have remained under repression in this Father religion, with its particularly forbidden connotations of the oedipal fantasy and the even earlier period of infantile symbiosis. The latter may here have been reactivated by the longing to merge with God. The concept of a return of the repressed in relation to the name Yahweh, as it occurs here, is also mentioned by Reik (28) although he too, like Baron (5) considers the name as possibly referring to a forgotten family tradition rather than one for merly familiar to the group as a whole. Stemming originally from a Hebrew family, brought up under the influence of Egyptian culture and then living for many years among the desert Midianites, one of whose daughters he took as wife, it is not surprising that Moses should have moments of confusion both about his own identity and that of God's (38, pp. 116-117). Add to these reality factors the under lying tendency we are assuming for a shifting identification from his own ego to God, and the foundation is laid for psychological phenomena of this kind. There is indeed a similarity in this second call of Moses to what occurred at the burning bush, but the likeness is understandable as a repetition of psychological forces within Moses himself. Encouraged by a renewed feeling of relationship with God, Moses speaks again to the people of Israel. But they also have been disillusioned and disheartened because of his first failure and they do not listen to him. Again, the effect of this rejection is traumatic. And at this point, God adds to the tension by bidding Moses go to Pharaoh once more and repeat the demand to let the Hebrews go. This prospect is evidently too threaten ing for Moses. He replies: ' Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips (VI: 12)? ' This is indeed a curious expression—of uncircumcised lips.</page><page sequence="8">Moses and Pharaoh 199 Circumcision, the ritual of the covenant with God, bestows the right of sexuality through a symbolic partial castration, as an act of submission to the Deity. Having uncircumcised lips may here be an expression of guilt on the part of Moses, of having retained his sense of omnipotence. It may express a failure in sublimation, a stubborn fixation to an oedipal conflict which sought to defeat the father-king of Egypt. Such a sense of guilt would indeed inhibit the power of speech when obstensibly Moses is pleading on behalf of others. Moreover, the competi tive feelings may refer, not only to Pharaoh, but to God Himself. This second narcissistic injury, his rejection by the people, must have been experienced by him as a punishment for feelings of omnipotence. Martin Buber, when referring to the expression, uncircum cised lips, comes close to a psychoanalytic interpretation, describ ing it as " not a mere defect in the instrument of speech, but a fundamental inhibition of expression (p. 59)." He attributes this situation to the fact that Moses acts as a mouth for God. And indeed, at the theophany of the burning bush, God says to him twice, within the space of four verses, ' I will be with thy mouth (IV: 12-16).' To be a part of Divinity even in this sym bolic sense, could have been very disturbing to one who indeed wished so strongly for this kind of relationship, a wish which, we assume, found utterance in these very words projected onto the Deity. God's response to Moses' cry about his uncircumcised lips is made indirectly, almost unobtrusively. He repeats his instruc tions but now addresses himself to both Moses and Aaron, al though Aaron's presence had not been mentioned up to this point. Thus again, as at the burning bush, Aaron is suddenly brought into the picture. He is the brother of whom God had said on that earlier occasion: ' I know that he can speak well. . . he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God (VI: 16).' Evidently the image of Aaron is to serve here as a supportive figure, the good brother-father. But in terms of our textual analysis, this easing of the situa tion is not enough. Again, there is a sudden shift in the con tinuity of the text. Without any connecting thought, the nar rative moves into a lengthy genealogical table, beginning,</page><page sequence="9">200 Dorothy F. Zeligs " These are the heads of their fathers' houses," and concluding with the words: " These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts .... these are that Moses and Aaron (VI: 14-27). " As in the instance mentioned earlier (VI:2-3), the interrup tion occurs as a sequence to God's instructions regarding the liberation of the Hebrews. Both are situations which involve Pharaoh, a dreaded father figure. In the first, Moses is to witness what God will do to Pharaoh (VI: 1), a punitive attitude insti gated by Moses himself and with which he identifies. On the second occasion, Moses is charged again to appear before the monarch and demand the release of his people. Both situations must have been very anxiety-producing for Moses, emotions which lead to a discontinuity of the text, as if the thought itself was too difficult to pursue. In the earlier instance, God re enforces His Presence by appearing to Moses under a new name. The second time, Moses himself is given a special place among his people. Both of these responses were of a reassuring nature. Evidently Moses could feel strengthened in two ways, both involving feelings of identity. One was through his relationship to God. Moses was the man chosen by God; that was his identity. Thus he tries repetitively, through inquiries about the name of God, to determine who He was, both in the past and in the present. The other way was to see himself clearly in the pattern of the family tree of which he was a living part. One commentator (21) intuitively senses that this abrupt introduction of the genealogical table does have psychological significance. He sees its purpose as a reminder that Moses is human, that he comes from human origins, and the temptation on the part of his descendants to deify the great leader must be resisted. My own interpretation is that Moses was fighting the unconscious impulse toward deification, and in a reactive with drawal from this temptation, which led to feelings of an opposite kind, had to remind himself of reality. As a further, more realistic function, the genealogy may also satisfy the sense of historic mission which imbues this entire narrative. The escape from bondage in Egypt was an event of phenomenal importance in the history of a people. Every detail</page><page sequence="10">Moses and Pharaoh 201 of this happening must be commemorated. How much more then should the prophet who appeared before Pharaoh and initiated this delivery be plainly identified! This historic pur pose, with its underlying narcissistic gratification, may also have helped to strengthen the courage of Moses at this crucial point. The two brothers are mentioned twice, first as Aaron and Moses, then shortly thereafter, as Moses and Aaron, in a kind of even handed justice concerning the matter of priority. This detail, too, may reflect the struggle of Moses against his narcissism. Fol lowing the genealogy, God resumes the interrupted theme, again instructing Moses to speak to Pharaoh. He prefaces his command with the words, ' I am the Lord; speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.' But again the distraught prophet pleads his disability. " And Moses said before the Lord, Behold I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me (VI: 29-30)? " God is still patient at this point. He seems to understand the problem, saying reassuringly, almost seductively: ' See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land (VII: 1-2).' God here smoothes the path for Moses. He satisfies both the sense of omnipotence Moses seems so greatly to desire: ' See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh,' and at the same time di minishes his anxiety, for it is God himself who makes him a god to Pharaoh, thus giving permission to be greater than the oedipal father-king. God also comfortingly allows him to be a child: ' Thou shalt speak all that I command thee.' Here, Moses remains under the protective authority of God, thus denying his own responsibility for guilty competitive wishes. Moreover, it is Aaron who is appointed to do the actual talking to Pharaoh, fur ther relieving Moses of his sense of verbal inadequacy. Here, as at the burning bush, God performs the function of the Loving, Protective Father, an aspect which manifests itself with particular clarity in how God relates to Moses during his periods of despondency and low self-esteem. We shall return to this point later in the study.</page><page sequence="11">202 Dorothy F. Zeligs The Ten Plagues The conflict between Moses and Pharaoh finds dramatic expression in the biblical narrative of the ten plagues. These catastrophies were visited upon the Egyptians in ever-increasing severity as a means of forcing the stubborn monarch to allow the Hebrews a three-day excursion into the desert, ostensibly for a religious festival. Both parties to the struggle understood that, in reality, the enslaved people would use this opportunity for an escape to freedom and in the course of events, this final outcome is tacitly accepted by both sides. Modern scholarship is largely in agreement that the story of the exodus has a historical basis (2a; 2; 5, p. 32) and that a series of calamitous events must indeed have taken place in Egypt at that time. All of the so-called plagues were intensifi cations of the natural disasters to which Egypt was prone. It is psychologically significant that the miraculous was thus rooted in the natural, the abnormal being an exaggeration of the nor mal. This factor indicates a closer relationship between reality and fantasy in the mythology of the Hebrews than was generally true of other ancient peoples. The biblical narrative is a literary tour de force, giving full expression to the struggle, not only between Moses and Pharaoh, but even more meaningful for our purpose, to the inner con flict within the heart and mind of the great Hebrew leader him self. The portrayal of Pharaoh, for the most part, lacks the quality of a real flesh and blood personality. He serves chiefly as a foil, an image of the powerful, bad father against whom Moses must pit his strength, not only in a reality struggle of gigantic proportions but one that is also psychologically fraught with an unconscious personal conflict here seeking externali zations. The repeated demand that Pharaoh comply with the re quest of Moses or suffer the punishment decreed by the God of the Hebrews is a direct challenge to the Egyptian ruler as the hitherto supreme semi-divine king of the land. He is repeatedly put into the humiliating position of submitting to a mysterious, unknown figure, appearing suddenly out of the desert and speaking in the name of a strange God. Pharaoh's so-called ob</page><page sequence="12">Moses and Pharaoh 203 stinacy is understandable. No absolute ruler of those times would readily allow himself to be divested of valuable slaves. There were no foreign armies on the borders of his land de manding surrender. There was no revolution within the palace, threatening to dethrone him. There were only Moses and Aaron, two strange men, probably clad in the simplest of gar ments, and armed only with a shepherd's staff. It is also under standable, even more so, that under such circumstances, Moses tended to be overcome at his own daring. Yet the underlying uncertainty in the narrative seems to be, not that Pharaoh will ultimately give in, but that he may yield too easily. In that event, the glory of the victory won by Moses would be diminished. Repeatedly we are told by God Himself that He would harden Pharaoh's heart so that the strength and glory of the Hebrew Deity would be abundantly displayed. We must assume that the need for exhibiting such power was an expression of Moses himself, projected onto God. A more specific analysis of the text gives evidence of this conflict between Moses' wish for omnipotence and the feelings of guilt and inadequacy. One element of the struggle can be seen in relation to the so-called rod of God and the unpredict able way in which it is used, at times by Moses and on other occasions by Aaron. Another aspect is the role of Aaron him self, whose appearances and disappearances are curiously erratic. The inconsistencies regarding the use of the rod and the partici pation by Aaron are explained by certain scholars of the school of Higher Biblical Criticism as a consequence of the inter weaving of various " sources " (8, p. 55 f.). Psychoanalytically, another view presents itself. The rod of God is first introduced and its magical powers demonstrated at the theophany of the burning bush when Moses expressed the fear that his own people would not believe that he was God's appointed messenger to them. This obviously phallic symbol is thus used as a form of reassurance for Moses. It is mentioned again on the same occasion when God reminds him of Aaron's existence and the latter's role as helper, for Moses had com plained that he could not speak well, being of slow tongue. But this image of Aaron must have been experienced not only as a supportive figure but also as a possible rival. So God says</page><page sequence="13">204 Dorothy F. Zeligs reassuringly, 'he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God. And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod where with thou shalt do the signs (IV: 16-17).' Thus Moses is assured that he is the one who will hold the rod and perform the signs. This original plan is later disregarded, as will be noted. The next mention of the rod occurs when Moses departs from Jethro after securing the latter's blessing. Here he leaves the supportive presence of the kindly father figure and the familiar home surroundings. " And Moses took his wife and sons, and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand (IV:20)." The loss of the good father and the fear of facing Pharaoh in Egypt is compensated for by the possession of the rod. It is in connection with the ten plagues that the magical staff is most frequently mentioned. It is utilized in a fashion that on the surface seems somewhat erratic, as though it were a matter of indifference whether Moses or Aaron handled this magical instrument. Yet, when it is first introduced in the confrontation with Pharaoh, the wording of the text seems to express an unusual carefulness. God presents the subject as if He were trying to preserve a balance satisfactory to Moses re garding the degree of power that was being bestowed on each of the two brothers. " And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a wonder for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went unto Pharaoh and they did so, as the Lord had commanded, and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent (7:8-10; italics added)." Here Aaron not only uses the rod but it is referred to as his. Why, one must wonder, is the text so explicit in its details about the respective roles of Moses and Aaron? We can assume here not only the problem of sharing in the omnipotence of the Father but also the sibling rivalry with Aaron. Guilt would be alleviated on both levels by allowing Aaron to participate in the display of power, a situation which might also unconsciously imply a sharing of the guilt. Having granted Aaron so large a part in this first episode,</page><page sequence="14">Moses and Pharaoh 205 Moses arrogates to himself a fuller degree of participation in the second meeting with Pharaoh. God now speaks to Moses alone, and Aaron temporarily vanishes from the scene. During the lengthy instructions to Moses, God tells him to say to Pharaoh: ' Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river (VII: 17-18; italics added).' As one biblical scholar remarked, "The transition from the Divine I just before to the I of Moses is very abrupt (8, p. 60)." Psychologically, however the juxtaposition of these two ïs makes sense. Moses is here so closely identified with God that in his mind the two temporarily merge. Then, as is to be expected, follows the retreat. For although Moses alone is addressed here by God and given a dramatic and powerful role to perform in the very presence of Pharaoh, the action is not actually carried out as here described. It can be assumed that the daring of Moses, which found an outlet in the spirited words uttered by God, with whom Moses was now strongly identified, could not be carried through in action by Moses himself. The narrative now reverses itself: " And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the waters of Egypt, . . . that they become blood;... And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the water turned to blood (VII: 19-20)." First, Moses alone is to perform the miracle. Suddenly, he brings Aaron again into the picture, allowing the latter a greater share of the honors. The ambivalence however comes through in the ambiguity of the pronoun in the words, " and he lifted up the rod," thus reflecting the struggle within Moses. Was it Moses or Aaron who performed this gesture? In the description of the second plague, there is a simi larity to the pattern followed in the first. God speaks to Moses only, bidding him go to Pharaoh with the command that he allow the Hebrews to leave. If he refuses to do so, God would</page><page sequence="15">206 Dorothy F. Zeligs bring a deluge of frogs upon the land. God now unexpectedly brings Aaron into the situation. " And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron Stretch forth thine hand with the rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt (VIII: 1-2)." As with the first plague, it is again Aaron who performs the magical gesture although the episode is introduced by the command of God to Moses that he is to go in and speak to Pharaoh. Another contradictory detail is that God instructs Moses to direct Aaron to stretch forth his hand with the rod, but in the following sentence, when the action is carried out, the text says, " And Aaron stretched out his hand," omitting the mention of the rod. The description of how this second plague would bring dis tress to the Egyptians and particularly to the household of Pharaoh is so explicit and so vivid in its detail that one can only wonder what Divine Purpose such eloquence could serve. In deed, there is an element of humor for the observing reader in these minutiae. The text says, " And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs (VII:28)." The investment of emotion contained in these graphic details can be attributed only to Moses himself. Involved is a projective identification with the Deity that becomes an im portant source of narcissistic gratification to Moses. This guilt laden competitiveness once more brings with it the pattern of retreat. Aaron is then quickly brought into the picture to lessen the anxiety but, at the last minute, the latter is deprived of the magical rod, using only his hand to accomplish the miracle. It cannot be without significance that the most dramatic passages in the text dealing with the confrontation of Moses and Pharaoh are the words spoken by God to Moses, who is to repeat them to the monarch, rather than the direct addresses by Moses himself to Pharaoh. We may have here further evidence of why Moses suffers from a certain inhibition of speech. If words are</page><page sequence="16">Moses and Pharaoh 207 libidinized and become a source of narcissistic pleasure, espe cially for aggressive purposes in triumphing over a rival, then such defensive measures as being of slow tongue and uncircum cised lips are psychologically understandable. Only during his transitory participation in the omnipotence of God, can Moses allow himself eloquence. Although disguised by projection upon God, this kind of verbal self-assertion may also lead to an inhibition in the actual carrying out of the aggressive act. At such times, Aaron, serving here as a kind of alter ego, fulfills this function for him. In the course of this second plague, however, a compara tively lengthy verbal exchange does take place between Moses and Pharaoh. In this situation, it is Pharaoh who calls for Moses and Aaron, saying, ' Entreat the Lord, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the Lord.' Moses here utilizes his position of strength in an unusual way. He says to Pharaoh: ' Have thou this glory over me, against what time shall I entreat for thee ... that the frogs be destroyed ... (VIIL4-5)? ' Here Moses takes it upon himself to let Pharaoh decide when the frogs should be removed, thus identifying himself clearly with the power of God. That this assumption of au thority caused him uneasiness is manifested when we are told that " Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh (italics added)." Then the text states " And the Lord did according to the word of Moses (VII:8-9)." Thus, this act of rather daring initiative meets with success. As the account of the contest between Moses and Pharaoh continues, the role of Aaron, a silent and shadowy figure at best, trails off into nothingness. Even the words, " And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron," no longer appear after the third plague. The fourth catastrophe is introduced by God speaking to Moses only. Aaron appears briefly in the formula, " And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron . . ." in order to plead with them to remove the pestilence. Moses plays an increasingly active role, and in the course of the last four plagues his confrontation with Pharaoh takes on a somewhat different form. The speeches he makes to the mon arch are now quoted directly. These addresses, although de</page><page sequence="17">208 Dorothy F. Zeligs livered with firmness, are always respectful in tone. They carry only a small part of the fervor and ringing determination which characterize God's own words as addressed to Moses, who is to repeat them to Pharaoh. We see here the difference between the dramatic eloquence of how one behaves preparatory to action, and the more subdued tones of behavior in reality. As the contest nears its end, the tension between the two opponents increases. In a gesture which Pharaoh must have deemed most generous, he announces to Moses: ' Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed; let your little ones also go with you.' But Moses becomes more demanding. Not only must the flocks and herds be allowed to leave with the people, but Pharaoh himself must provide animals for sacrifices to be made to the God of Israel. Pharaoh is enraged. He re sponds, ' Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die (X:28).' Some scholars regard this command as one which Moses follows literally, and try to find rationalizations for the fact that Moses does appear before Pharaoh again to make the dread an nouncement of the last plague. We are, in fact, told that Pharaoh also sends for him during the night of this final catastrophe and urgently orders him and his people to leave Egypt forthwith. This dread occasion provides the climax to the entire series of disasters. Moses announces that God Himself will go forth at midnight and strike down the firstborn of all Egyptians, including even the first-born of their cattle. The dramatic declaration is made directly by Moses to Pharaoh. Moreover, Moses allows his own feelings to find ex pression, something he had not done previously. At the end of the dire prediction, we are told, " And he went forth from Pharaoh in hot anger (XI: 8)." The carrying out of this threat, which, according to the text, would bring death to every household in Egypt, is set against the background of elaborate instructions for the prepa ration of the Passover. Directions are given, first by God to Moses and Aaron, and then conveyed by Moses to the elders of Israel. Each household is to slaughter a lamb, one year old and without blemish. The blood from this sacrifice is to be spread upon the doorposts of the houses where the Hebrews</page><page sequence="18">Moses and Pharaoh 209 lived. This pascal lamb is then to be roasted and eaten by each family group, together with bitter herbs and unleavened bread, as a sacrificial meal. It was to be consumed in haste, preparatory for departure, .. with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand (XI: 11).' We shall deal with this event mainly in relation to its psychological significance for Moses. This anthropomorphic view of God " going out into the midst of Egypt," on his errand of death, must indeed encompass unconsciously the image of Moses himself at the height of his identification with God. In the course of the description, given here by God to Moses, the text says, ' And the blood (upon the doorposts) shall be to you (the Hebrews) for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood I shall pass over you and there shall be no plague upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt (XII: IB; italics added).' Surely God could know without the visible sign of blood where the Hebrews lived. The preceding plagues had also fallen upon the Egyptians and spared the Hebrews without any signs to set one group apart from the other. The only exception was to note, at times, that the land of Goshen, the area where, it is assumed, most Hebrews lived, would not be subject to the disasters. Why then, one must wonder, is this distinctive sign established for the tenth plague? The words, ' And when I see the blood, I shall pass over you,' clearly states that God Himself will use this evidence as a sign. The impression is that Moses again identifies with God but retains his human sensibilities, related here, perhaps, to feelings of narcissistic gratification in this most omnipotent of all acts. A further, more realistic purpose, however, is also evident in the text. The words . . and the blood shall be to you for a token," indicate that the occasion had to be dramatized for the people as an event in their history, never to be forgotten. They therefore had to play a role in it themselves. Indeed, the course of the narrative is interrupted to declare the importance of this occasion for future generations. The festival of Passover is solemnly established, to be observed each year with a symbolic repetition of the pascal ceremony and the sacrificial meal (34).</page><page sequence="19">210 Dorothy F. Zeligs The first premonition of this tenth plague came at the very beginning of Moses' return to Egypt, when he himself was " at tacked by God," who " sought to slay him (IV:24)." As men tioned earlier in this study, he also was saved by a sacrifice involving blood, the circumcision of his son by his wife, Zipporah. A unity is now established between the resolve with which Moses entered Egypt and the carrying out of this resolve at the point when he leaves the land. Unconsciously involved was the oedipal revenge which had to be fulfilled against the hostile father through the sacrifice of the son. The second part of the oedipal fantasy, the conquest of the woman, is symbolized in the act of " spoiling the Egyptians," when the Hebrews asked for and received from them " jewels of silver and jewels of gold, and raiment (XII: 35); "(39). The individual oedipal fantasy can thus be detected in Moses as an undercurrent to the major theme (38), the liberation of his people. This situation has psychoanalytic validity, for the greatness of man and the strength of his deeds often have as their initial motive power the unfulfilled dreams and wishes and the angry hurts of the child. The threat of the tenth plague is carried out. Pharaoh, in a state of panic, calls for Moses and Aaron during the night and bids them leave forthwith, with their people and all their pos sessions (XII:31-32). Thus the exodus takes place, an event regarded by many as the true beginnings of the Hebrews as a historic people. The Flight The final episode of the contest between Moses and Pharaoh, however, is not yet over. As the story portrays, Pharaoh characteristically has a change of heart after the Hebrews leave. The cry goes up: " What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? . . . And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, . . . and overtook them encamped by the sea . . . (XXIV:5-9)." The idea is clearly conveyed that this dilemma of being caught between the waters and the pursuing Egyptians was pur posely planned by God as a further opportunity of showing His</page><page sequence="20">Moses and Pharaoh 211 power over Pharaoh. "... And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them: and I will get Me honor upon Pharaoh and upon all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord (XIV: 1-4)." Two more times, within a brief space, the same motive is expressed again, ostensibly by God (XIV: 17-18). The Hebrews, however, respond to the situation with near panic. " And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness (XIV: 10-11)." Moses answers the reproaches of the fear-stricken people like a true leader, speaking with unusual confidence and strength. He says, 'Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will work for you today; for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more for ever. The Lord will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace (XV: 13-14).' And now occurs another of those puzzling non-sequiturs in the text which seems to indicate an omission of some kind. The narrative continues in quite another vein. " And the Lord said unto Moses: Wherefore criest thou unto Me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground (XIV: 15-16)." Actually, Moses had responded to the exigency of the occasion with the strength needed to rally his people at this crucial time. Without his display of leadership, panic and dis integration could easily have resulted. Why then God's reproof to Moses, " Wherefore criest thou unto Me? " These words may well be a reponse to something other than the utterance just made by the leader to his people. In reality, it was the people who had cried unto the Lord, not Moses. And it was the latter who answered them as though he were God. At this moment, prompted by the crisis at hand, Moses' identification with God must have been particularly strong. If, unconsciously, it was to</page><page sequence="21">212 Dorothy F. Zeligs his own miraculous powers that he was so confidently alluding when Moses called upon the people ' to see the salvation of the Lord, which He will work for you today,' an intrapsychic re action was to be expected. Who was he to announce a miracle without God's preliminary instruction! It may have been in the reactive feelings of helplessness and inadequacy following upon his daring that a silent call for help did indeed rise up within Moses. However, the situation was hardly the time for giving way to such feelings and they were quickly repressed. This re pression finds a meaningful omission in the wordlessness of the text. Only in the response of God, the quick admonishment and the specific guiding instructions during the moment of con fusion that must have followed, can we detect what may have preceded them within the heart of Moses. One is reminded here of a previous situation, much less momentous, when Moses also makes a promise of his own which depends on God's compliance for fulfillment. It is when Moses promises Pharaoh that God will remove the frogs from Egypt on the morrow. There, too, we are told that "Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses (VIII: 12-13; italics added)." But on this later occasion, when so much more was involved, God returns the responsibility to Moses, forcing both him and the people into active roles. But God's rebuke to Moses for his passivity and the directions for action are followed immediately by the glory motif of getting Himself honor, expressed even more blatantly and repetitively, as described above (XIV: 17-18). As with the story of the plagues, the miracle of the divided waters and the safe crossing of the Hebrews involve situations which have a basis in the potentially possible. Studies of wind and tides indicate that in the area involved, a strong northeast wind together with an ebbing tide could have swept away the shallow waters for a number of hours before an opposite current of air drove the waves back upon their accustomed path (8, p. 125). In regard to the route taken by the Hebrews, as de scribed in the Bible, Albright says that in terms of his Sinai expedition of 1947-48, based upon recent archaeological findings of ancient biblical sites, the biblical description in Exodus was</page><page sequence="22">Moses and Pharaoh 213 the only logical one the Hebrews could have followed (2, p. 14). The site of crossing was the Sea of Reeds, not the Red Sea itself. This momentous occasion in the history of a people con cludes fittingly with the famous song of triumph in the following chapter of Exodus (XV). This ode is especially associated with Miriam, the sister of Moses, who leads the other women in the exultant words of the song, accompanied by timbrels and dancing. In referring to Miriam, the text describes her as " the sister of Aaron," without mentioning her relationship to Moses. The omission seems rather obvious. It may indicate a dissociation of Moses from his personal family life, especially on this occasion when all his feelings were concentrated in the event taking place and in his total libidinal involvement with God and the people, Israel, as a whole (3). We may then have here another indication of how closely the text seems to reflect the mood and feelings of the hero. The song, thought to be among the oldest of biblical writ ings, dating back to the thirteenth-twelfth centuries B.C. (2, p. 14) expresses ecstatic feelings of deliverance and victory: " I will sing unto the Lord, for he is highly exalted:/The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea." It describes the dramatic destruction of the enemy and the miraculous rescue of Israel: " They sank as lead in the mighty waters," but " Thou in thy love hast led the people which thou hast redeemed," are but a few excerpts from the lengthy song-poem. The crossing of the sea, climaxing the escape from slavery in Egypt, became one of the most important milestones of Hebrew biblical history, second only to the Covenant at Mount Sinai. It is memorialized at the annual festival of Passover, when every Jew is exhorted, not only to remember the event, but to think of himself as one of those who was personally de livered from the Egyptians at that fateful time. Psychodynamics of Moses: Further Considerations It is suggested here that the realistic task Moses assumed in confronting and challenging Pharaoh reactivated the oedipal situation of earlier life. The father figure was split into the powerful, oppressive image of the bad father, Pharaoh, and the</page><page sequence="23">214 Dorothy F. Zeligs Idealized, Omnipotent, Good Father-God. Significantly, the real parent, the Hebrew Amram, is not even mentioned in this important segment of the Moses saga except in a genealogical table. Moses was involved with the internalized father. The influence of Pharaoh on the fantasy life of the youthful Moses can be conjectured as centering upon his omnipotence and his role as oppressor. Moses may have identified positively with the former aspect in wishful thinking and negatively with the latter image. He must have contrasted unfavorably the powerlessness of his own Hebrew father with the greatness and strength of Pharaoh, thus making Amram, a despised figure, in part. The tendency of Moses to self-depreciation and to identify with the victim may have stemmed from such a source. But there can be no doubt that Moses also had a strong positive identification with the father of his early childhood, a figure who generally remains a source of idealized strength and power (22). Moreover, the Levite Amram and his wife, Yochebed, who was also the sister of his father, must have occupied a position of prestige among their own people, regard less of the low esteem in which the Hebrews were held in the larger social system. In their home it could be expected that the traditions of the patriarchal ancestors would be kept fresh in the memory of the family, thus making the God of his fathers an early influence in the life of Moses. Certain it is that without these positive ties to his family Moses could not have identified with his Hebrew brethren and his whole development as leader and prophet would not have taken place. More significant and complex than the way Moses related to Pharaoh is the pattern of how he related to God. The uncon scious mechanism of splitting the father figure into good and bad images protected Moses from excessive ambivalence toward the Deity by allowing a polarization of aggressive feelings onto Pharaoh, a suitable object for such emotions. The most repetitive pattern we have noted was the way Moses oscillated in his feelings between omnipotence and inadequacy (3). There is a further quality that plays a significant part in the relationship between Moses and God. It involves an aspect of the superego which has tended to be overlooked generally in psychoanalytic writings by all but a few (32, 33). I refer here to the supportive role played by the Deity toward his chosen prophet.</page><page sequence="24">Moses and Pharaoh 215 As shown in this study and earlier ones, God treats his chosen prophet as a good psychotherapist might deal with a patient who is suffering from feelings of anxiety, inadequacy, and discouragement, God reassures, explains, builds up self confidence, gives specific instructions in appropriate situations, answers questions where clarification is requested, as in problems of identity regarding both God and Moses. He allows this son figure to share in the omnipotence of the Father, decreases anxiety by securing the help of Aaron, shows patience and forbearance in the face of discouragement on the part of Moses and his wish to retreat, and teaches him the techniques of deal ing both with his own people and with Pharaoh. God under stands the narcissistic needs of Moses, for after all, a certain amount of narcissism is essential in the make-up of a prophet (3). Thus he allows Moses the gratification of being god to Aaron and to Pharaoh. He reveals himself to Moses by a special name, supposedly unknown even to the Patriarchs. At the same time, God holds the prophet firmly to the task at hand, admonishes, directs, and uses his authority to enforce action. Although it has been assumed as obvious, pei haps it should be stated that this essay is not concerned with the problem of the nature of God in an objective or philosophic fashion. Such an approach lies outside the realm of psychoanalytic exploration, as Freud has made clear (10). What, then, from a psychodynamic view of Moses himself, does this aspect of the relationship with God signify? It indicates clearly that Moses experienced the Deity, not only as the strict Superego, the source of morality, of laws and commandments, but also as the Loving Superego, who supports the ego and en courages its constructive development, both in the world of reality and in its conflicts with instinctual wishes and fears. In his interesting study, Shafer (33) has pointed out that al though Freud, for theoretical and historical reasons, emphasized the prohibiting and censoring role of the superego, he also gave numerous indications of its function to protect and love. Sandler also points out this function (32). And indeed it is the comfort ing and protecting Father as well as the feared Authority which gives to religious life its peculiar strength (13, p. 52). It was precisely during his periods of depression and dis</page><page sequence="25">216 Dorothy F. Zeligs couragement that Moses was able to muster his ego strength by calling upon the support of a Loving Superego. Without this kind of psychic resource, he could not have achieved the self confidence that made his accomplishment possible. Those who tend to see the religion of the Old Testament solely as the expression of a stern and forbidding Father-re ligion, miss this other aspect. The concept of a loving relation ship between God and man is a basic element in the biblical theme. And although he tended to emphasize the negative aspects of religion (13, 14, 15), it was Freud who also caught the element of compassion in Moses, his hero, when he interpreted the Moses of Michelangelo (12) as resisting the impulse to destroy the Tablets of the Law and keep them intact for his people. In the popular fantasy, the figure of Moses does indeed stand out more vividly in his role as powerful emancipator and stern lawgiver. Yet it was the feeling of compassion for his suffering brethren that motivated his great undertaking in the first place. The Man and the Myth While this study is based on the personality of Moses as revealed in the biblical text, it is of interest to note that modern scholarship, for the most part, accepts the historicity of Moses even though there are no extra-biblical sources to confirm his individual existence (5, p. 341; 26; 2, p. 254 f.). Even the earlier Patriarchal Period, not too long ago considered as entirely legendary, now has a firm basis as marking the authentic begin nings of Hebrew life, as archaeology corroborates the vivid de tails of its social background (1; 36, p. XLIII). The words, leader and hero, in the biblical connotation, can, in most cases, be used synonymously. Since the group is the chief hero of the Bible story, the individual leader can only be understood in his relationship to the group. It has been re marked by scholars that if this literature had not presented us with such personalities as Abraham and Moses, it would have been necessary to assume their existence in order to explain the tasks of leadership accomplished in their names. This reality aspect does not affect the role such leaders play as mythopoeic figures.</page><page sequence="26">Moses and Pharaoh 217 The narratives of the Bible can be understood as a folk literature, expressive of the people as a whole (23). They mark a kind of halfway point between history and mythology, the events of history being used as a framework within which the psychological functions similar to those that motivate the mythologies of other peoples are performed. Advances in psychoanalytic ego psychology have led to in creased interest in the interpretation of the myth from the view point of how it deals with instinctual wishes and fears in terms of the adaptive needs and functions of the ego (37). Arlow has described myths as shared fantasies which help the individual in his integration with the group, thus serving as a stabilizing and socializing force in society (4). Slochower gives emphasis to another aspect, the role of the mythical hero as the rebel, the iconoclast, breaking established idols and pushing forward to new horizons (30, 31). The biblical hero fulfilled both these functions. As a leader, his role was a dynamic one, helping to move the group forward against its own inner resistances toward a preconceived but often obscured historic goal. At the same time he provided a model for identification that acted as a cohesive force. Being both leader and prophet, he served too as the " voice of God," thus symbolizing the collective superego. But he was also clearly human in the struggles with his own intrapsychic conflicts. In contrast to the hero of primitive myths, who gratified his instinctual wishes, the heroic act of the biblical leader consisted, in part, of overcoming his oedipal dilemma along the lines of renunciation and sublimation, thus identifying with the com mands of the Father-God. It was in this process of becoming that he served as an example of the superego in statu nascendi (41). Thus his human weaknesses, his occasional falls from grace, were an understandable, even a necessary part of the biblical theme, with its emphasis on guilt and redemption. The mythopoeic process functioned in terms of selecting and emphasizing those aspects of behavior and personality in its heroic figures that were especially significant for the group in terms of its stage of psychosocial development. But in a manner peculiarly its own, the biblical story care fully preserves the individual character of its leaders. Each is a</page><page sequence="27">218 Dorothy F. Zeligs distinctive personality. Thus the biblical hero cannot be under stood only on the level of an abstraction, as symbolizing a projec tion of psychic processes in the group at a given period in its history (4). He is both man and myth, both unique and uni versal. He reflects in microcosm the psychic forces potent in the group but does so in his own individual fashion (2, p. 241). The personality of Moses strikingly illustrates this dual aspect. In his conflict with Pharaoh, Moses not only freed his people from slavery, but also emancipated himself psychically, to a larger degree, from the remaining bondage of the earlier oedipal struggle, with its burden of aggression and guilt. Thus he made both himself and his people available for the Covenant at Mount Sinai. In his profound critique of Freud, the French philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, feels that the theme of religion is treated in too narrow a sphere and that Freud several times came near to but never opened the path of his thinking to the more creative aspects of the religious feelings in man. This limitation, Ricoeur believes, stems from too close a connection between the father complex and the belief in God. He writes " The sense of guilt seems to have no history beyond the Oedipus complex and its dissolution. It remains a preventive procedure with respect to anticipated punishment. But an epigenesis of guilt cannot be directly established by a psychology of the superego; it can only be deciphered by the indirect means of a textual exegesis of the penitential literature. . . . Man arrives at adult, normal ethical guilt when he understands himself according to the figures of this exemplary history." Thus he feels that a shortcoming in Freud's theory of religion came about because he circumvented " an exegesis of the texts in and through which the religious man has formed and educated his beliefs (29, pp. 532-551)." He, too, as does Slochower, (30) emphasizes the mythopoeic function as a continuing re-interpretation of earlier material in the light of the emergent needs of society. While the present study does indeed focus upon the oedipal aspect, the first layer, as it were, of this kind of exploration, the writer feels that much more remains to be deciphered in the ambiguous and symbolic language of the text. The psychodynamics of Moses as interpreted here does not</page><page sequence="28">Moses and Pharaoh 219 attempt to present a full picture of this complex and mysterious personality, even in this one aspect of his confrontation with Pharaoh. Psychoanalysis has tended to be both baffled and in trigued, both humble and curious, in the face of genius. Per haps it is these very attitudes that provide the challenge for continuing exploration.
