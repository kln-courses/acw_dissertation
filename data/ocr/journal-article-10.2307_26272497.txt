BARNA  SOCIO-HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  OF CULTURAL CHANGES IN SOUTH-WESTERN- HUNGARY AS REFLECTED BY ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA DURING POST-LBK TIMES  ABSTRACT: The questions of socio-historical circumstances in South-Western Hungary based on observations made mainly at sites in Zala county during Post-LBK times are discussed below. This time period corresponds to the turn of the Middle and Late Neolithic in Western-Hungary which is, at the same time, the beginning of the emergence of the Lengyel culture. It has previously been accepted that there was genetic continuity between the LBK and the Lengyel cultures. The formation process of the Lengyel culture in Hungary has recently been reviewed. The role of the Sopot culture turned out to be more significant than it formerly had been conceived. The emergence of the Lengyel culture has been reconsidered also in other territories, e.g. in Slovakia, where a great cultural and historical break from the preceding LBK (Želiezovce Group) was proved. Climatic changes are hypothesized in the background of the changes. According to former theories the genesis of the Lengyel culture was considered as a process taking place on the multicultural substrate of the LBK groups in which the Sopot culture played a catalyser role causing and inspiring the transformations. On the other hand, essential details of this time period, among them the factual character of the changes, were not clarified. A fair number of new data resulted from lately excavated sites of the Sopot culture, e.g. Becsehely-Bükkaljai-dűlő, Petrivente-Újkúti-dűlő, Sormás-Török-földek, and Sormás-Mántai-dűlő have broadened our knowledge significantly on the turn of the Middle and Late Neolithic. By the end of the Middle Neolithic a high concentration of Late LBK and Sopot settlements developed in South-Western-Transdanubia. In the territory considered earlier as a periphery compared to the Sopot central core area a secondary settlement block was formed, which consisted of a close chain of extended and enclosed settlements (e.g. the sites mentioned above). The nature of Post-LBK times are mainly discussed on detailed analyses of two sites from the study area. A multicultural site at Sormás-Török-földek represents settlements of the Sopot and Lengyel cultures. Beyond substantial new relative chronological data several absolute chronological radiocarbon data are also available both from Sopot and formative Lengyel contexts from the site.

The Esztergályhorváti find assemblage is dated by 14C to the same period as Sormás-Török-földek. The comparative review of these two sites aims to clarify whether Post-LBK times in South-Western-Hungary were calm, peaceful terms generating prosperous and continuous development of local communities or should it rather be interpreted as a wartime, fraught with danger and violence? The author sets out arguments in favour of the peaceful nature of this time period. KEY WORDS: South-Western Hungary – Enclosure – Mass grave – Sopot culture – Formative Lengyel culture INTRODUCTION (P.

The investigated time period corresponds to formation of the culture were the LBK and the Sopot the turn of the Middle and Late Neolithic in Western culture.

His As it has been mentioned J. Makkay was the first who final conclusion was that since this was the only mass brought the Esztergályhorváti mass grave in relation with burial that included males only, there must have been violence, correlating it with the social and military a war waged in this region as a result of which these conditions and events of the transition period from the males were buried. The cause of death of these males Sopot-Bicske times (i.e.: the Transdanubian Sopot could not be determined exactly, and it is not known, culture) to the Lengyel ones. Meanwhile, he also either, who performed the burial act. Were these males emphasised the ritual character of the find assemblage buried by survivors within their own community (Makkay et al. 1996: 275). J.-P. Faruggia has interpreted following a not completely successful military attack the Esztergályhorváti mass grave together with the LBK (Makkay 2000: 35), or by the enemy, who won the massacres of Asparn, Talheim and Herxheim as battle (Makkay 2000: 63–65). As a third possibility J. a manifestation of violence accompanying a crises Makkay supposes that the survivors, after they were hypothesised around 5100 BC.

He located the males, who fell in this battle from their own origin of the crises somewhere in the middle Danube community. He considered cult purposes "secondary" (Faruggia 2002).
