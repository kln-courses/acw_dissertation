<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iconographie Interpretation of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan Saburo Sugiyama One particularly frustrating problem, despite considerable archaeological effort and analytical study (e.g. Gamio 1922; Reygadas 1930; Rubín de la Borbolla 1947; Armillas 1947; Drucker 1974; Cabrera et al. 1982a; Cowgill 1983; Sugiyama 1989; R. Millón 1988 and many others), is that the history and function of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan have not been understood sufficiently. Generally, what is needed are more complete excavations that will provide new informa tion from earlier periods and more thorough analysis and interprétation of materials, especially those related to ideolo gical matters. A prime example may be found in the case of the temple's enigmatic iconography, about which I offer here a ^ new interprétation. The iconography is located on the talud y tablero, a typical Teotihuacan architectural type, of the Temple's plat form façades (Fig. 1), exhibiting explicitly religious Sym bols. The main image is the morphologically understood feathered serpent, a traditional figure that continued to appear in similar forms until the Aztec period although the meanings of the image in that period are still obscure. On the other hand, there are unidentified heads that are embedded alternately with the feathered serpent heads in the tablero walls. Both their morphological interprétation and meanings are controversial. These unidentified représentations were interpreted as Tlaloc by Gamio ( 1922: LX VI) and Reygadas ( 1930:166), as Yohualcoatl, the black nocturnal serpent, or one form of Quetzalcoatl, by Jiménez Moreno (Armillas 1945:24), and as Itzpapalotl, the Obsidian Butterfly, by Linné (1934: 30). Armillas has identified the feathered serpent's head as an attribute of Tlaloc, suggesting the interprétation of non feathered-serpent heads as Tlaloc, the rain god (1945: 24 26). There have also been interprétations of these enigmatic heads as those of the cipactli, an alligator-like créature that appears in Aztec códices (Drucker 1974: 13). Caso has pointed out the similarity of the heads in question to those of the Oaxacan deity that he calis el dios con el moño en el tocado (the god with the knot in its headdress) and has interpreted them as belonging to Xiuhcoatl or the Fire Serpent (Caso and Bemal 1952:113-116). Drucker, taking account of the last interprétation, has tried to explain the two différent heads in the tablero as a juxtaposed pair of beings. According to his interprétation, part of the body of Xiuhcoatl and his rattles are not depicted because of their overlapping (1974: 16). Marquina (1950), Drucker (1974), and Coggins (1986) have suggested that the Ciudadela and the Temple of Quetzalcoatl had ritual calendrical functions, and Michael Coe has hypothesized that these reliefs "represent the initial création of the universe through a series of dual oppositions" (1981: 168).Thus, although some nterpretations appear to be more likely than others, a convincing interprétation has</page><page sequence="2">Fig. la. Section of the façade of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, including staircase sculpture (after Séjourné 1966a: Fig. 32) not been established. In contrast to these interprétations as an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic head, I will discuss éviden ce which indicates that these enigmatic heads are headdres ses in the form of a modified, abstracted animal head, inde pendent of the feathered serpent body sculptured in the "natural" form as a background for the tablero. As such, it conveys specific meaning within Teotihuacan's symbolic communication System. Fig. Ib. Detail of possibleheaddress représentation at the Temple of Quetzalcoatl (after Caso and Bemal 1952: 113-114) Teotihuacan iconography seems to be fundamentally conventionalized. Almost all elements have beert repeated in the art of Teotihuacan over a period of several hundred years. In the case of a complex of iconographie elements, it is also unusual not to find similar représentations. Many repeated représentations, some of which are relatively careless repro ductions, even give the impression that Teotihuacan specia lists were carrying out their routine assignment according to conventional rules. The traditional mode can also be seen in the symbolic composition of figures and in the distribution of space, especially in the case of the mural paintings. Although représentations of gods, animais, or human beings omamented with headdresses are very common in Mesoamerica, head dress représentations depicted independently of figures and expressed repeatedly by conventional means seem to be a characteristic motif of Teotihuacan iconography (Séjourné 1966b: Figs. 95, 117, 138; Miller 1973: Figs. 25, 193, 316, 329, among others). Langley has included the feathered head dress symbols in his systematic and morphological analysis of Teotihuacan signs (1986:107-1243). Pasztory has arguedthat the headdress of a deity contains "some glyphic or symbolic element that serves to identify him" (1976: 121). It seems to me that the unidentified head at the temple symbolically represents a feathered serpent headdress. There are several mural examples that support this inter prétation, employing a similar compositional style. In the border area of the mural paintings of a "procession of priests" at Tepantitla (Fig. 3), headdress représentations with feathered eyes are depicted independently on the feathered serpents' bodies. The figures of the simpler headdress, basically of the same type having feathered eyes, appear repeatedly on a smaller scale on the bodies of the priests and also on the bags which they grasp, ail of them upside-down, as if to emphasize the symbolic aspect of the headdress, which seems to be related to a group of priests in procession. Fig.2. Detail of a Tepantitla mural, showing an example of a headdress représentation depicted independently from other motifs (after Miller 1973:94) The mural decorating the altar of the Patio Colorado at Atetelco (Miller 1973: 164) also has headdress représenta tions in the form of feathered rectangles with two quincunx and an interlace sign inside, suggesting the specific use of headdress représentations and their morphological indepen dence from the background design on the tablero. Feathered serpent images are depicted on the molding and the base of the altar with the same quincunx signs. The fragmented Fig. 3. Detail of Tepantitla mural (after Miller 1973: 100) 69</page><page sequence="3">mural painting encountered in the principal patio of Zacuala (Fig. 4) is another good example, which shows an independent représentation of a headdress overlapping the curved body of a feathered serpent. The component elements of the body demónstrate similarity to those of the serpent figures in the collection of the San Francisco Arts Museum, while the form of headdress itself is similar to those of the Tepantitla mural, except that the former has a disk, whereas the latter has feathered eyes. Fig. 4. Detail of a Zacuala mural (after Séjourné 1966a: Fig. 9, and Miller 1973:112-113) The compositional notion of the overlapping of two différent motifs with emphasis on the headdress représenta tion, especially in relation to the feathered serpent figures, seems to have been applied to the Temple of Quetzalcoatl as well by means of monumental sculpture. The serpents' bodies in the tablero, beginning with the clearly feathered serpent heads, seem to extend beneath the unidentified heads, which do not appear to be part of the body, before terminating in rattles. The iconography of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl has been considered in former studies to be a d Fig. 5. Stone relief from Soyoltepec, Southern Veracruz (after von /U Winning 1979: Fig. 24a) Fig. 6. Plaque relief from the ceramic Workshop discovered in the Compound on the north side of the Ciudadela (after Múnera in press typical expression of dualism demonstrated by means of the juxtaposition of the two différent beings; however, there is in fact no element that suggests this dualism if the unidentified heads represent headdresses. The principal motif expressed in the tablero, as well as that in the talud, is that of the feathered serpent swimming in the water to which the shell représentations refer. The idea of non-dualism seems to fit nicely with the data related to the staircase, which has only the feathered serpent heads embed ded in its balustrades. The bodies of these heads seem to go underwater and to reappear in the tablero on both sides of the staircase. According to Marquina's reconstruction of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl (Marquina 1950: Lám. 19), the number of the head représentations on the balustrades corre sponds to that of the terminal parts of the serpents' bodies carved in relief on the tableros adjacent to the staircase. Moreover, the mural of shell motifs painted on the lateral walls of the staircase appears to have given to worshippers of that time a clearer image of the feathered serpents emerging from the water on both sides of the ascent to the top of the platform. The iconography of the temple in question reminds one of the mural painting "Mythological Animais" (Miller: 1973: 71-72) in which the feathered serpents are also winding through the water with other creative animais. A detailed examination of their compositional elements suggests that these unidentified monstrous heads represent headdresses in the form of the feathered serpents. Von Win ning, discussing the knot of el dios con el moño en el tocado in his recent synthetic work on Teotihuacan iconography, mentions this unidentified head as a "stylized serpent head" (1987, I: 152-153, Fig. 2), suggesting that he also sees the diagnostic elements linking the unidentified head with the serpent. The typical "bird's eyes" are shared by différent beings, but their curling terminal form is a characteristic of the feathered serpent. The heads have only upper jaws, below and inside which a nose pendant is depicted. Such nose pendants sometimes appear immediately below a complex headdress (e.g. Caso 1966: Fig. 2b; Berlo 1984: Plate 45; Gamio 1922: Lám. 33), but are never depicted below an animal's upper jaw in Teotihuacan iconography.

The highly elabórate architectural monumentality of the complex, which included living and/or administrative quarters, the temple, and a huge public plaza, as well as the dedicatory sacrifice of many soldiers (all of which date from the same time during the Miccaotli phase) suggests the presence of a powerful group or institution exactly at the central part of the metrópolis. Addendum In a recent unpublished paper which Karl Taube sent me in response to my présent paper, he has independently noted that the unidentified head alternating with the feathered ser pent on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl is actually a headdress. He suggests that a great variety of feathered serpent représen tations found outside of Teotihuacan are linked with this temple. He still proposes dual aspects at the Quetzalcoatl Temple, suggesting an association of "the feathered serpent with fertility and the interior affairs of the State and the War Serpent with military conquest and empire". He describes the War Serpent as a "solar fire serpent ancestral to the Xiuhcoatl of Postclassic central Mexico". However, I can't see any diagnostic iconographie element distinguishing the feathe red serpent from the War Serpent.

Hierzu werden die ikonographischen Elemente, die mit dem Tempel in Beziehung stehen, im Detail untersucht. Außerdem wird festgestellt, daß der Tempel nichts erhält, was Dualismus ausdrücken könnte. Unter Berücksichtigung neuerer Ergebnisse sowohl ikonographischer Untersuchungen wie der Aufdeckung von Grabstätten am Quetzal coatl-Tempel, kommt die Untersuchung zu dem Schluß, daß der Tempel als symbolischer Ausdruck der religiösen und politischen Macht einer dominierenden Institution gewesen sei, die in der Ciudadela von Teotihuacan angesiedelt war. RESUMEN: El presente artículo propone que las esculturas no identificadas, que se encuentran empotradas alternativamente con las cabezas de la serpiente emplumada en el Templo de Quetzalcóatl, Teotihuacán, muy probablemente son representaciones de un tocado de dicha serpiente expresada en forma abstracta. El estudio contiene un análisis detallado de los elementos iconográficos relacionados con dicho templo. Por otro lado, acentúa que el templo no tiene ningún elemento que manifieste dualismo. Tomando en cuenta informaciones recientes provenientes, tanto de otros estudios icono gráficos, como de los descubrimientos de los entierros dedicados al Templo del Quetzalcóatl, el presente análisis iconográfico concluye que el templo se puede intepretar como una expresión simbólica del poder religioso y político de una institución ubicada en la Ciudadela de Teotihuacán.</page></plain_text>
