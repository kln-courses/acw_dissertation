Fischer Nietzsche-Archive in Weimar: A Retroactive Studiolo 1 of Henry van de Velde In early January, 1889, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), a professor of philology in early retirement, sent several obscure letters to friends and colleagues from Torino signed "Dionysos," "Nietzsche Caesar," or "the Crucified."2 His alarmed friend Franz Overbeck arrived in Torino from Basel on January 8th and found Nietzsche already losing control of his senses. Overbeck decided to take Nietzsche back with him to Basel's asylum - the first station in an eleven-and-a-half- year twilight of madness. After Nietzsche's breakdown, his manuscripts, letters and parts of his library remained in Torino, as well as in other locations from his unstable life: in Italian cities and alpine villages, with friends in Basel and family in Naumburg. With the ebbing of hope for Nietzsche's mental recovery, the question arose of what to do with his literary remains, especially since the last months of his rational life were extraordinarily productive. Nietzsche's mother was overwhelmed with caring for him and as a pastor's widow she was repelled by the radical writings of her son, but she conceded to allow Franz Overbeck and Heinrich Köselitz (Nietzsche's former student and secretary respectively), to function as literary executors. In 1893, Nietzsche's younger sister Elisabeth Förster returned from a failed anti-Semitic colony experiment in Paraguay, where she had lost her husband, wealth, and mission, and immediately took over as the representative of Nietzsche's 42 interests and seized his literary remains.3 She gathered together his manuscripts, struggled with Nietzsche's publisher for the proof sheets with his annotations, asked all correspondence partners for a return or copy of his letters, and collected his library and private papers. In 1894 Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche (the name she used from then on), was able to open the "Nietzsche- Archiv" on the first floor of her mother's house in the small city of Naumburg. The sick philosopher himself lived upstairs. Soon her literary circles, afternoon teas, piano soirées and other social activities interfered with looking after her brother, and Elisabeth chose to move to Weimar, to participate in the social life of the Grand Duke's court and to profit from the glorious cultural shine of Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang Goethe - the emblems of German literature and poetry. In the spring of 1896, a grant from Meta von Salis, a writer friend of Nietzsche, provided Elisabeth with a villa in the hills overlooking Weimar, because the death of their mother had made it necessary to re-unify the archive and care for the mad philosopher-brother under the same roof. Nietzsche himself was transported at night in a special train cabin from Naumburg to Weimar. In the meantime Elisabeth had twice started an edition of Nietzsche's works. Although she was in charge of the copyrights of the published works and had managed to</page><page sequence="2">collect almost all of the literary remains, she disassociated herself several times from the editors she had engaged: first she fired Köselitz, who had been working as an editor since 1893. Then she hired and fired Fritz Kögel, Rudolf Steiner - the later founder of Anthroposophy - as well as Ernst and August Honeffer within a few years. Finally, in 1898 Köselitz, the only one able to read Nietzsche's cryptic handwriting, came back and helped her to start the editing project of the 20-volume, "Complete Works," which was not finished before 1913.4 This work, together with a pocketbook edition, a selection of Nietzsche's writings and an edition of the collected letters were a big success. Translated soon into French, English, and many other languages these volumes were the basis of "Nietzsche" as the cultural phenomenon that we are still infected with today.5 However, the Nietzsche-Archive remained a private institution, or more precisely, a one-woman-property, which brought unfortunate side effects to the publishing policy. With the unscrupulous help of her editors, Elisabeth held back Nietzsche's finished, but unpublished autobiographical work Ecce Homo,6 revised several of his letters, and compiled his so-called masterpiece, Will to Power. In addition, she vindicated her own image of her brother with a series of biographies.7 This met criticism from the beginning by Nietzsche's former friends such as Overbeck as well as former editors and employees of Elisabeth. Nevertheless, Elisabeth enjoyed great confidence from almost all public intellectuals of her time. She was still induced by her brother, as she showed the "fallen eagle," the most important "piece" in her collection, to "special guests" of the archive. Following the example of Cosima Wagner as high priestess of the Wagner cult in Bayreuth, Elisabeth cultivated her role of devoted sister, wise woman, and hostess of a cultural circle in Weimar. With the help of the patron Count Harry Kessler the archive soon turned into a center for avant-gardes. Elisabeth understood the importance of art and media in modern society (as well as the new laws on copyright) and monopolized the production of Nietzsche portraits, sculptures and photographs by various artists. In fact, she made use of photographs of her brother from the time before his breakdown and only preferred paintings, etchings, and sculptures of the sick philosopher. Finally, with the help of Kessler, she succeeded in finding the appropriate artists Hans Olde and Max Klinger, who were able to handle the delicate problem of representing Nietzsche whose character hovered between intimate martyr and heroic prophet. Elisabeth handed out pieces and fragments of Nietzsche's writings to several of the new art and literature magazines, which were emerging around the turn of the century in Berlin, Vienna, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Munich, and Leipzig. These publications helped to connect the philosophy of Nietzsche with new aesthetic movements and thus raised the demand for Nietzsche's works. The increase in income through donations and royalties made it possible for Elisabeth not only to pay for transcribing, correcting, and editing Nietzsche's works, but also to enjoy living in bourgeois comfort. Already in 1898 she started to make alterations to the villa "Silberblick" (gleam of silver). The building belonged de facto to Meta von Salis and Elizabeth's actions led to a break-up of this friendship. But after the death of Nietzsche in August 1900, it became obvious that she was in need of a new attraction for the archive: an interior design by the style reformer van de Velde. The Flemish painter, autodidactic designer, and architect Henry van de Velde was recognized as an early enthusiastic follower of the "philosopher with the hammer." After his break-through as a precursor of art nouveau at the exhibition of Dresden in 1896, van de Velde's star began to shine in Germany and within the same circles that were interested in Nietzsche's "New Man." In spring 1901, he gave a lecture series about the theoretical foundation of the "New Style" in the well- known salon of Cornelia Richter in Berlin, and Kessler introduced him at one of his soirées to Elisabeth. She in turn invited van de Velde and Kessler on a pèlerinage to Nietzsche's tomb on 25 August 1901, the first anniversary of his death. In 1901, after he had left behind the idea of a new guild society with the bankruptcy of his arts-and- crafts workshops in Berlin and Brussels, van de Velde became immediately interested in the idea of reforming the applied arts production in the grand duchy of Weimar. Elisabeth, on the other hand, wanted to re-animate the idea of a cultural Weimar movement. After the "golden age" of the poets Schiller and Goethe, followed by the "silver age" of the composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt, she thought of a "New Weimar" of literature, arts, architecture and life reform with the help of van de Velde under the banner of Nietzsche's philosophy. To reinforce her diplomatic maneuvers for his appointment at court, in fall of 1901, she hired van de Velde to modify the archival villa Silberblick. Changes in the design of the archive could reinforce Elisabeth's autonomy, who had also taken over the ownership of the archival villa that same year. Van de Velde, who as early as 1890s had seen Nietzsche's philosophy as a fundamental critique for bourgeois culture and artistic production, and who had sensed his "mission" in a renewal of the applied arts, now saw the chance to combine his interests in aesthetic reform and new style with an homage to "his" philosopher. 43</page><page sequence="3">Furthermore, the design of the Nietzsche-Archive became an exemplary case study of van de Velde's concept of "ornamental transcription," or, programmatic art in the sense of late Romantic music theory. Van de Velde was aware of this model of conceptual reference to external thoughts of philosophy or literature as formulated by Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. He applied those ideas to architecture, furnishing and book design. Programmatic art was meant to disarm the latent distrust put forward by idealistic philosophy against music (and architecture) in the aesthetics of Kant, Hegel or Schelling, who preferred philosophy and poetry. They disregarded music (and architecture) as meaningless entertainment or emotional expression, and therefore as inferior arts. According to Wagner, music is able to refer to an external philosophic "program" by the title of the work, an explanatory theoretical text of the composer (where the name "program" is taken from), and a significant way of structuring the abstract material into themes or the so-called leitmotifs. Wagner goes on to explain that Beethoven consciously transgressed the canonic symphonic form with the vocal finale of his Symphony no. 9 in order to transcend and express highest emotion: the celebration of joy of a liberated mankind. This moment was in Wagner's eyes the rebirth of the Gesamtkunstwerk (synthesis of arts) of ancient Greek tragedy. Van de Velde adopted this idea of synthesis of arts interpenetrating all aspects of life. But even more relevant for van de Velde's aesthetic thought was the rejection of mimicry and imitation in the concept of programmatic art, providing an abstract object with philosophic meaning beyond the application of symbolic ornament or classical tectonic language. Nietzsche, who had reflected on Wagner and the metaphysics of music in his early writings, proposed yet another important motive of non-figural representation: he suggested an identity of internal and external worlds, a characteristic of the post- Christian thinker with his built environment, which reformulates the pre-Socratic idea of physis as an organic unity of spirit and matter or what Nietzsche called the "architecture for the perceptive."8 At the Nietzsche-Archive van de Velde operated with a series of manipulations that can be read as "programmatic": he improved the unsatisfactory entrance of the house by adding a street-facing portico to the simple cubic building (Fig. 1). To mark its status as a public institution, he labeled it with the inscription "Nietzsche- Archiv" carved in stone in broad roman letters. This gesture did not correspond to the status of a private villa, but had to be understood in the context of programmatic art as "title" of this work. For building the new façade van de Velde continued to use the brick and stucco of the existing structure, but rather than resembling 44 Figure 3. Above, Nietzsche-Archive by Henry van de Velde, view from the Entrance (East). The stele by Max Klinger can be seen in the back; below view from the West (Weimar, 1992) Figure 4. Nietzsche-Archive. The picture was taken in early 1980s, shortly before renovations</page><page sequence="4">the original's Neo-Renaissance wall and opening, the new street façade is a compositional play of surfaces and proportions. This anthropomorphic positioning of openings can be directly connected to Nietzsche's idea of physiognomic expression, as in the "architecture for the perceptive." The excessive height of the dark oak entrance door serves as part of this geometric frame, but for the approaching guest it offers another enigma: instead of a door handle there is a set of sculptural brazen handholds with labyrinth ornamentation (Fig. 2). This might reflect on the unclear status of the house as both shrine and villa, literary archive and last domicile of the philosopher, but at the same time it structured the proportion of power of inside and outside: the arriving guest had to request access. In addition, van de Velde noted in an earlier version of his memoirs, in the chapter "The Nietzsche- Archive and the New Weimar" that he intended to give the archive an appearance "more solemn and monumental like a Schatzkammer [treasure chamber]"9 - the leitmotif of this work. Once inside, there is a dark entrance hall. A crystalline lamp10 over the doorway illuminates cloakrooms containing a series of brass coat hooks, which work as joints between the capitalist chaos outside and the synthesis of art inside, constructing a new society of "Nietzscheans." A few steps to the right, a double door opens to the "treasure" of the archive: the library with "His" books and manuscripts. This oblong room, a merging of two smaller rooms, has a rather low ceiling for its size. Since van de Velde could not easily change the height within an existing house, he chose a repetitive vertical structure as "organic ribs" to arrange the walls and virtually elevate and carry the white plafond. These planks hold the shelves for books, but integrate openings - with movable window grilles to prohibit unwanted visitors - as well as other furniture, even a chamber piano. The color palette of this room ranges from natural red beech to fraise-colored plush and intensive red curtains, heightened by white stucco and brass details. The only contrast is the grayish-blue carpet - the room as a whole invoked the atmosphere of the alpenglow11 of Nietzsche's Zarathustra. Van de Velde put another "title" reference inside his work, this time in the form of the initial of the philosopher's name: a brass N in a circle is embedded in the wall above the tiled stove. Nietzsche himself, apart from his books on the shelves and his manuscripts in the cupboards, is "present" in a life-size marble stele (or vertical sculptural object) by Max Klinger. The only object in the room that is not designed by van de Velde, is this stele , which rests on a platform against a surface of colored glass illuminated by evening light. (Fig. 3) But why did van de Velde deliberately blur the status of the main room between private salon and sacred temple, literary archive and intimate library? The answer might be found in the program of the "New Weimar" and its direct rivalry with the cult of Goethe, manifest in the conversion of Goethe's house in Weimar to a national museum in 1885 as well as the new Goethe- Schiller- Archives, built in 1896. The Nietzsche- Archive had to undergo comparison with the palazzo of the thinker, poet and minister (three characteristics of Goethe) with its exquisite classical interiors and artwork. Goethe had brought back the idea of the humanist studiolo from his Italian Journey (1786-87) and remodeled his house into a personal microcosm: the succession of salons, dining hall, study chamber, scientific collection, garden and library were read as an ideal portrait of the educated bourgeois. Van de Velde's strategy of staging a mood of authenticity, a plausible yet retroactive studiolo for the dead philosopher, was extraordinary successful. For Nietzsche, who had never consciously understood that he had vegetated four years in Weimar, van de Velde created a physiologic resemblance of architecture and philosophy and constructed an organic atmosphere for "the perceptive" with a synthetic work of art in his new style. The interiors of the Nietzsche-Archive (and van de Velde's book illustrations) soon became synonymous with "Nietzsche design," providing evidence of the modernity and superiority of "his" philosopher. Figure 2. Villa Silberblick/Nietzsche-Archive, Portico, 1904 45</page><page sequence="5">Epilogue After WWII, the Nietzsche-Archive was closed down because of its association with the Nazi regime. The incriminating contact became manifest in a neoclassicist "Nietzsche memorial hall" next to the Nietzsche-Archive from 1938, also remained unfinished. Nietzsche's manuscripts and books, together with Elisabeth's literary remains, were confiscated by the East German authorities and transferred to the socialist predecessor of the Weimar Classics Foundation or Nationale Forschungs- und Gedenkstätte (der Deutschen Klassik) Weimar. Since Georg Lukas had denounced Nietzsche's philosophy as proto-fascism, 12 there was almost no opportunity for serious research on archival stocks of Nietzsche in East Germany. The Nietzsche-Archive building was "hidden" by the new owners,13 the inscription destroyed, the villa modified and reused as a seminar building and guesthouse of the socialist "National Research and Memorial Place in Weimar."14 (Fig. 4) In the 1960s, the Italian philosopher Giorgio Colli and the Italian philologist Mazzino Montinari started their project of a new critical edition of Nietzsche's works. An ideological re-evaluation of art nouveau and early modernism in the 1960s and 70s opened the dialogue for a renovation of the archive building as well as its interior, which was begun in 1984, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and remained unfinished until 1991 in the re- united Germany. Today the Nietzsche-Archive is a museum of the national Weimar Classics Foundation. It is open to the public, but the manuscripts are stored in the Goethe-Schiller- Archives. Friedrich Nietzsche's as well as his sister's books belong to the Anna Amalia Library of the same Weimar Classics Foundation in Weimar and are only accessible for institutional research. Ironically, the private archive of the philosopher's sister was after all united with its national rival and Nietzsche's original writings became even part of the world's cultural heritage,15 but not in the sense imagined: the Nietzsche-Archive is an archive with empty shelves Notes 1.

The final transcription and edition of the handwritten fragments has remained unfinished up until today - 106 years after Nietzsche's death. 8. "Architecture for the perceptive : There is and probably will be a need to perceive what our great cities lack above all: still, wide extensive places for reflection; places with tall, spacious, lengthy colonnades for inclement or unduly sunny weather where no traffic noise or street cries can penetrate, and where a finer sensibility would forbid even a priest from praying aloud: buildings and locations that express as a whole the sublimity of bethinking and of stepping aside. The time is past when the Church possessed the monopoly of reflection; when the vita contemplativa primarily had to be a vita religiosa; and yet that is the idea expressed in everything the Church has built. I do not know how we could ever content ourselves with its buildings, even stripped of their ecclesiastical function; they speak far too emotive and too constrained a language, as the houses of God and as the showplaces of intercourse with another world, for us as godless people to think our thoughts in them. We want to have ourselves translated into stones and plants; we want to have ourselves to stroll in, when we take a turn in those porticoes and gardens."

This reddish glow has been read as reference to the mountain setting, the Parsi worship of the sun and the blood metaphors in Nietzsche's Zarathustra. All three: the metaphor of sun/light/fire, the metaphor of the clear and crisp mountain atmosphere, and the metaphor of blood can be found in Nietzsche's Zarathustra and were reflected by van de Velde in his Nietzsche-Archive works. 12.

The name "Nietzsche-Archiv" was erased from the city plans as well as from street signs, and people were instructed to use the new name.

Affected by this alteration was the second floor of the Nietzsche-Archive with the "private" chambers of Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and the death room of Friedrich Nietzsche, which were destroyed at that time. These rooms were not touched by van de Velde's restoration of 1902-03; some of the furniture remained in the possession of the repository of Goethe National Museum in Weimar. 15.
