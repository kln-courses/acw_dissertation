<plain_text><page sequence="1">10 ARNHART'S EXPLANATORY PLURALISM RICHARD A. RICHARDS Larry Arnhart, in his "Biopolitical Science," argues for a compre hensive, integrative approach to political science.1 According to Arnhart, this "biopolitical" framework of a "science of political animals" moves through three main levels of "deep" political his tory—a universal political history of the human species; a cultural political history of groups; and individual political history—and incorporates multiple explanatory factors based on, in his terms, natural and social history, morality, judgment, emotion, religion, ambition, and liberal education. Arnhart illustrates this approach through his explanation of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 in terms of the natural history of the hu man species, the cultural history of America, and the individual history of Lincoln. The details of Arnhart's specific example are beyond my expertise, and I will not comment on them. The basic substance and method of his approach are, however, of consider able philosophical and methodological interest. I will here sketch out, first, what I take to be the virtues of Arnhart's biopolitical ap proach; second, the challenges in employing such an approach; and, third, a contrast with other methodological stances. I endorse both the substance and the method of Arnhart's bio political approach. The substance of his approach lies in its reli ance on what we know from science—biology and evolution, in particular—to understand human political behavior. On such a biopolitical approach, for instance, we can understand human 277</page><page sequence="2">278 Richard A. Richards political behavior partly on the basis of similarities between hu mans and their closest primate relatives; partly on the basis of what we know about the evolutionary history of the human lineage; and partly on the basis of what we know about brain functioning and development. The method of his approach is pluralistic and empirical. It is pluralistic in two ways. First, it is pluralistic in terms of the "ex plananda"—what is being explained—the political history of the species; the cultural political history; and the individual political history. On this approach, what we need to understand is not just the actions of individual actors and the particular culture in which they act but also certain behavioral patterns of humans in general, across cultural and natural environments, and over time periods that transcend cultural idiosyncrasies. Second, it is pluralistic in terms of the "explanans"—the causal factors employed in explana tion. Arnhart advocates the use of multiple kinds of explanations in his list of relevant factors—in terms of natural and social history, morality, judgment, emotion, religion, ambition, and education. Finally, Arnhart's approach is empirical in that he advocates reli ance on the observationally based methods of science. The well confirmed theories of evolutionary biology, anthropology, and the brain sciences provide the explanation "store"—the causal mech anisms that can potentially funcdon in an explanation of politi cal behavior. Arnhart argues that his approach to political science is in the methodological tradition of Aristotle and Darwin. This is certainly plausible. Aristotle saw humans as political animals, and in his Metaphysics he famously argued for a pluralism within the frame work of his four causes: formal, efficient, material, and teleologi cal. The specific explanations of human political behavior that Aristotle employed were often based on the same principles he might use to explain the behavior of other creatures—even if hu mans were nonetheless unique by the possession of various capaci ties not possessed by other creatures or not possessed to the same degree. Darwin was, if anything, even more committed to this sort of continuity in the understanding of human behavior, including political behavior, on the same principles that we can understand nonhuman animal behavior. But Darwin's pluralistic framework (as developed in his Origin and then in the Descent of Man) also</page><page sequence="3">Arnhart's Explanatory Pluralism 279 explained human behavior by reference to natural selection and sexual selection, as well as evolutionary history, the effect of the environment, use and disuse, and the correlation of parts. While the substance of Arnhart's approach may not be precisely the same as Darwin's—since evolutionary theory and biology have changed dramatically in the past 150 years—the fundamental commitments seem to be in the same spirit. One disadvantage of such a pluralistic approach is that it is very complicated. Isn't simplicity a scientific value? Wasn't Newton's hy pothesis of universal gravitation good precisely because it unified different phenomena under a single explanation—a centripetal force that varies in proportion to mass and in inverse proportion to distance? On a pluralistic approach, different phenomena may require different explanations, and each of these explanations may in turn appeal to multiple factors. And, if the various factors are difficult to tease apart, then it is difficult to determine the ef fects of each factor. For instance, there are difficulties when we try to tease apart the various genetic and environmental factors in development. Actual developmental outcomes of organisms and traits typically depend on multiple genes, affected by multiple fac tors in multiple levels of cellular and external environments. The complexity of Arnhart's biopolitical approach is even more strik ing, as evidenced by his list of relevant factors from natural and social history to emotion, ambition, and more. A second disadvantage of explanatory pluralism is that it re quires some knowledge of all these factors. If, for instance, we are to give a fully adequate explanation of the development of any particular human, we need to know more than his or her geno type. We need to know what constituted the cellular and external environments and the operation of the various causal factors in these environments. This presents a challenge to anyone under taking a pluralistic, empirical approach. And, given the recent ex plosion of information about biological processes, the demand for knowledge can be daunting. To apply a biopolitical approach, we would ultimately need to know not just the cultural history and the psychology of those involved but also the biology, the evolutionary history, and more. In an academic world that values specialization, this is a demand not often met. Nonetheless, the advantages of a pluralistic approach outweigh</page><page sequence="4">280 Richard A. Richards the disadvantages. As Aristotle emphasized, the approach to an in quiry depends on the nature of the subject. Astrophysics may be served by the simplicity of Newton's theory of universal gravita tion, but biology, psychology, and political science may not be well served by a similar simplicity. If there are in fact muldple causal factors for some phenomenon, then pluralism is not just preferred but required. This is illustrated by a disagreement in evolutionary biology. Darwin recognized multiple forms of selection—most sig nificant, natural and sexual selection. For Darwin, which mecha nism was explanatory depended on circumstances. Features that were advantageous for survival were to be explained in terms of natural selection. Features that were advantageous for reproduction were to be explained in terms of sexual selection. The tail of a peacock, for instance, is clearly not an advantage for survival in the struggle against predators, but it is an advantage in attracting a mate. Recendy, though, evolutionary biologists have defined nat ural selection simply as a change in gene frequencies over time. Genes that increase in frequency in a population are therefore to be explained as products of natural selection. This is simpler than Darwin's framework, but it cannot distinguish traits that are an advantage in survival from those that are an advantage in re production. More precisely, it cannot distinguish traits that are an advantage in reproduction but not in survival from those that are an advantage in survival but not in reproduction.2 Here, a plural istic framework has greater explanatory resolution. This is not an isolated case. In biology, climatology, natural history, and the so cial sciences, there are typically multiple causes, and simplicity is therefore often a vice, rather than a virtue. There is another advantage to Arnhart's biopolidcal approach. That is its empirical stance. This empirical stance is most obvious in his willingness to appeal to scientific theories and observation. How science is empirical and, consequently, how Arnhart's biopo lidcal stance is empirical are far beyond the scope of discussion here. I don't mean to imply that, because of its empirical basis, science is somehow infallible. Nonetheless, few of us really doubt the power of natural science in its more rigorous forms to give us understanding of the world. We fly on huge airplanes, take antibi otics and vaccines, and get MRIs and genetic testing because we have confidence in the conclusions of science. This is all true in</page><page sequence="5">Arnhart's Explanatory Pluralism 281 spite of the recent postmodern challenges to the authority of sci ence. Surely we want some of this authority for the human and social sciences. 1. Challenges for a Pluralistic "Biopolitical" Framework Our recognition of the virtues of a biopolitical approach does not require that we overlook the challenges. The first and most obvious challenge lies in getting the science right. This is more difficult than it might initially seem. We cannot just look to the most recent scientific theories for scientific truth. The history of science is filled with theories taken by consensus to be the final word, only to be later shown as false. In fact, it may seem that the history of science is really a story of one false theory followed by another. Philosophers of science have noted this and highlighted it in the "pessimist's induction," whereby the established falsity of each historical theory provides evidence that the current theory or future theories will also be shown false. The failures of Aristo telian, Cartesian, and Newtonian mechanics, for instance, seem to provide evidence for the ultimate failure of relativistic mechan ics. We find this problem in the biological sciences as well. Homo habilus and Homo erectus, once thought to be ancestors of Homo sa piens, are now often taken by many to be on other branches of the primate lineage.3 If so, they are not our ancestors. And it may be that the human environment of the Pleistocene was not quite what we thought it was and that the operation of natural selection was therefore not just as we thought. This fallibility of science cannot be ignored. And the pessimis tic puzzle about scientific progress—how one false theory can re place another yet still be an improvement—is not easily or simply solved. Nonetheless, we have abundant practical evidence that sci ence is still the best way to arrive at an understanding of natural phenomena, and not just in its efficacy to give us airplanes that fly, vaccines that protect us against disease, computers that get smaller and faster, and procedures to identify and correct deficits in brain functioning. Science also has a theoretical power—a power to give us the causal mechanisms that make its practical success possible. It is not just that we have the ability to control nature in these</page><page sequence="6">282 Richard A. Richards ways but that we have seemingly uncovered the underlying mecha nisms. It is these causal mechanisms that make explanation and understanding of nature—and human political nature—possible. What this all implies is that, just as a scientific account of nature in general is fallible and subject to revision, so is a biopolitical ac count of human nature. Nonetheless, our understanding of the causal mechanisms is enriched by the appeal to scientific theories. There are other challenges for a pluralistic, biopolitical ap proach as well. Arnhart gives us a list of factors that he takes to be relevant to a biopolitical explanation. His list includes: natural and social history, morality, judgment, emotion, religion, ambition, and liberal education. Within each of these categories there is a set of explanatory factors. We can, I think, ask how he arrived at this list of categories and how he identified the explanatory factors within each category. If I understand him correctly, this is to be an empirical process. But even a little reflection suggests that this empirical process is not simple or straightforward. Some factors are on this list because of how they fit into scientific theories, and they get their explanatory power in part from the power of their respective theories. Explanations based on brain functioning, for instance, get their power to explain in part because they are for mulated in the terms of a well-confirmed empirical theory about how the brain works that has successfully explained other cases. But other explanations look very different. They are based not on scientific theories but on what we might call "folk theories." These explanations appeal to the ways that we explain human (and animal) behavior in prescientific or everyday terms. When we explain the actions of a politician, for instance, in terms of his or her ambition, we are appealing not to a scientific theory about physical causation but to a folk theory about the politician's de sires and goals.4 Similarly, when we explain an action in terms of a belief and a desire, such as we see in Arnhart's explanation of Lincoln's actions, we are using a folk theory to understand that action. There are some obvious questions lurking here. What is the status of these "folk explanations"? How can they be combined with scientific explanations into an overarching framework? We can, I think, understand the problem in terms of what are sometimes described as "intentional explanations." Intentional explanations are explanations formulated in terms of intentional</page><page sequence="7">Arnhart's Explanatory Pluralism 283 states. Intentional states are states with content. The belief that one action is better than another, for instance, is intentional be cause it has content—the proposition that "one action is better than another." The first problem with intentional explanations is that they seem to rely on a different kind of causal mechanism than physical causes. How can the content of a belief or a desire play a causal role within an empirical, scientific framework? We cannot obviously associate a physical mechanism with the content of a belief. This is a problem that has plagued philosophy of mind for some time. Different people can have the same intentional state by virtue of having the same content of a belief or desire but still have different physical states that fit into the causal framework in different ways. This worry is amplified by consideration of the difficulty in measuring and verifying intentional content. How do we verify the presence of a belief with particular content? And how can we measure things like the degrees of belief "that something" or a desire "for something"? The worry here is that folk theories and intentional states are not easily incorporated into a scientific framework that is based on physical mechanisms and looks for quantifiable data.5 This is a problem that has yet to be solved. There is yet another challenge for a pluralistic, empirical biopo litical theory. First, on what basis can we decide which factors are relevant? We have causal factors based on theories in the natural sciences. We have causal factors based on theories in the social sci ences. And we also have folk theories. A pluralistic framework has to give us the resources to decide which factors are most relevant to an explanation. Is a pardcular event best explained in terms of a scientific theory or in terms of a folk theory, or both? The answer to this, in my opinion, varies depending on what is to be explained and the state of scientific understanding. If we have a well-confirmed scientific theory that can explain an action, perhaps we start there. For instance, if we know enough about brain func tioning to explain why a particular sensory input has a particular motor output, then this should be our starting point. But, if we lack such information, we may be forced to give a folk explanation in terms of what we think a person sees, believes, and desires— or saw, believed, and desired. Similarly, if we lack the information about the specifics of a particular event, we may need to revert to a folk explanation. We simply have no information about the</page><page sequence="8">284 Richard A. Richards physical state of Lincoln, for instance, so we cannot apply a scien tific theory that requires such information. In these cases, we have a contextual and pragmatic criterion to help us choose between kinds of explanations: use what information you have, and apply the best explanatory strategy given that information. But, even within a particular kind of explanation, the choice of explanations is still open. Often, there are competing theories with competing explanations. There are a variety of empirical cri teria here that can help us though. An explanatory factor that has a history of success has some justification, especially in compar ison with one that does not have that history of success. An up and-coming theory has perhaps more support than one in decline. So an explanation based on an up-and-coming theory is perhaps better supported empirically. Furthermore, we might also gener ally prefer explanations that are more empirical—and that employ mechanisms that can be relatively easily observed or connected to observation. I can only gesture toward all the important issues here, but what I think is ultimately most important is that what counts as a good explanation in a biopolitical framework should be empirical in some way or another. That is we cannot decide a priori what factors should be used in any particular explanation. 2. Comparing Approaches It might be easy to get the impression here that, with all the chal lenges I have outlined, a pluralistic, empirical "biopolitical" ap proach is unworkable. I am far from suggesting this. As I have already indicated, I fully endorse the substance and method of Arnhart's approach. We should, however, also understand the dif ficulties in such an approach, and I believe there are many. But, just as we typically judge scientific theories by comparing them with competing theories, so should we judge methodological ap proaches by comparing them with other approaches. The alterna tives to an empirical pluralism, in my view, are clearly inferior. One alternative is based on the substance and rejects the assumption that science, biology in particular, can really explain human be havior. The second alternative is based on method and applies an a priori approach to explanation. The first alternative, based on substance, has a very long history</page><page sequence="9">Arnhart 's Explanatory Pluralism 285 and is committed to the view that, because human nature is unique in some way, humans are exempt from the laws of nature that ap ply to other creatures. Consequently, human behavior cannot be explained on the same grounds that we use to explain the behavior of other creatures. One "ontological" version of this exemptional ism undoubtedly had its origins in an earlier, religious stance, but it gets clear presentation in the philosophy of Descartes. Descartes argued in his Meditation VI that there are two kinds of substances, a material, extended substance and an immaterial, thinking sub stance. For humans, these substances are joined together—a phys ical, extended body joined with an unextended thinking substance or soul. As students in introductory philosophy courses learn, this leads to a problem in mind/body causal interaction. First, it is not obvious how an extended, material substance can cause effects in a nonmaterial, nonextended thinking substance or, in turn, be affected by it. Second, because the laws of nature apply only to the extended, material substance, the nonextended, immaterial part of human nature—the soul—is not subject to the laws of na ture. (In contrast, for Descartes, nonhuman creatures are only of material body and not thinking substance and therefore are fully subject to these laws.) On the Cartesian account, then, humans fit into the causal nexus of the world in a very different way from other creatures. The downside is the difficulty in seeing how hu mans can causally interact with the world, but the upside is that, because we have a nonmaterial soul, we can act in ways that are outside the normal patterns of cause and effect. We, unlike other creatures, can transcend the laws of nature! This ontological du alism thus leads to a causal exemptionalism. It also reflects a deep tendency for humans to see themselves as somehow unique and exempt from the laws of nature. There are other ways to be an exemptionalist about humans. One related approach, also with a very long history that goes back at least to Plato and his tripartite conception of the soul (as laid out in Book IV of The Republic), is to see humans as different from other creatures on the basis of their reason: the capacity for hu mans to self-consciously think about themselves and the world, represent the world, and have beliefs, preferences, desires, and fears about the world. The philosopher Christine Korsgaard seems to argue for such a rationalistic exemptionalism (that she identifies</page><page sequence="10">286 Richard A. Richards with Kant) in response to the arguments of the primatologist Frans de Waal that we can understand human moral behavior by analogy with that of other primates. A form of life governed by principles and values is a very different thing from a form of life governed by instinct, desire and emo tion—even a very intelligent and sociable form of life governed by instinct, desire and emotions. . . . We have ideas about what we ought to do and to be like and we are constantly trying to live up to them. Apes do not live in that way. . . . Even if apes are sometimes courteous, responsible and brave, it is not because they think they should be.6 According to this sort of rationalistic exemptionalism, human be havior has a different and unique set of causes—causes based on self-conscious commitment to "principles and values," as opposed to "mere" instinct and emotion. Therefore, human behavior can not be explained on the same naturalistic principles we use to ex plain the actions of other creatures. Our reason allows us to tran scend the laws of nature! Another form of exemptionalism can be found in the approach that emphasizes the importance of culture for humans. According to this cultural exemptionalism (usually associated with the views of the cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict but shared by many in the social sciences), humans have escaped their biology by virtue of their lives being a product of the cultures they create, and that in turn "creates" them. On this view, humans—unlike other crea tures—create a culture in which they grow and live, a culture that determines their beliefs, attitudes, values, and goals. It does this, in part, through the language associated with a particular culture. Language, on this version of exemptionalism, "constructs" a reality that is independent of mere nature. Culture and language there fore make us exempt from the laws of nature. The anthropologist Loren Eisley is explicit: "The mind of man, by indétermination, by the power of choice and cultural communication, is on the verge of escape from the blind control of that deterministic world with which the Darwinists had unconsciously shackled man."7 The first problem with these exemptionalisms is that they seem to depend in part on ignorance of the nonhuman animal world and, in consequence, on an anthropocentrism that is not sup</page><page sequence="11">Arnhart 's Explanatory Pluralism 287 ported by the science. The Cartesian claim that only humans have a "thinking substance" is not just problematic in its metaphysics but also dismissive of much of what we know about animal cogni tion. There are clear analogs of human thinking in other animals, particularly our primate relatives. Chimps and bonobos may not think just as humans think, but they do something similar.8 Simi larly, they may not have a human political behavior, but they have a primate political behavior that shares much with the human.9 An analogous ignorance about human cognition is required to fol low Korsgaard in treadng humans as motivated just by principles and reason and not by emotion and instinct. Human cognition, like much animal cognition, seems to be a product of a complex mix of deliberation, instinct, and emotion.10 It may be a mix with a different emphasis, but it is a mix, nonetheless. Finally, while we can trivially claim that only humans have human culture, it would be the height of anthropic arrogance to claim that nothing like culture can be found in other primates, some mammals, and even birds. Even more problematic is the exemptionalist implication that human behavior is somehow "miraculous" by virtue of its occur ring outside the natural causal framework. In the theological tra dition, an event is a miracle if it was caused by something beyond the normal causal framework—the intervention of a supernatural God. Likewise, if human action occurs outside the normal causal framework by virtue of its basis in rationality, culture, or language, it is just as miraculous as if caused by a supernatural God inter vening in the natural world. Moreover, if there are interventions into the normal causal framework, whether on the basis of reason, culture, language, or a God, then the causal regularities assumed by scientific law seem unjustified. If human action in the natural world is not governed by the causal framework of nature, then the assumption that the world is governed by causal regularities seems itself problematic. The laws of nature cannot be constantly coun tervened by reason, culture, and language and still be true laws of nature. The point is this: if the exemptionalists are right, nature cannot have the causal regularities science assumes it has. One can be scientific or an exemptionalist, but not both. The alternative to a biopolitical approach based on method is one that begins with an a priori explanatory framework. This is</page><page sequence="12">288 Richard A. Richards a framework that is accepted on a commitment to certain kinds of explanations independent of empirical investigation. Arnhart mentions one such framework that seeks to explain political be havior in terms of "rational self-interest." There are other a priori approaches as well, most notably those based on one of the holy trinity—race, class, and gender. The idea is that we might adopt the "lens" or "analytic framework" of class and then look at the events of interest in terms of class interest. And we could adopt similar approaches based on gender, race, or rational self-interest. There are some obvious problems with these a priori ap proaches. First, if we adopt one of these analytic frameworks, we can seemingly explain everything in terms of the causal factors al lowed by the framework. They can explain too much. Just as ad aptationism produced a flurry of "just so" stories that seemed to trivially confirm the all-importance of natural selection, these a priori explanations based on rational self-interest, race, class, and gender seem to trivially confirm the assumptions of the approach, through their own versions of "just so" stories. To be clear, we need not reject the potential relevance of the explanatory factors in any of these frameworks based on rational self-interest, race, class, and gender—if our empirical methods suggest relevance. But there is more than a whiff of circularity here: assume some factor or set of factors, construct an explanation based on this set of factors, con clude on the basis of explanatory success that the assumed factors are the correct explanation. There is much more to be said about the exemptionalist and a priori approaches. Advocates of these approaches may see my characterization as unfair. Perhaps, in actual application, these alternatives are not always as exemptionalist or a priori as I have described. Nonetheless, there is a real difference between a frame work that tells us to look at all plausible explanations—including those from science—and a framework that begins by looking at just a single factor or a few factors. There is also a real difference between an approach that rejects scientific explanations of human behavior and one that embraces them. There is also much more to be said about Arnhart's pluralistic, biopolitical approach to political science. We can look more closely at each of the factors on his list of things that matter. We can look at "morality," for instance. Beginning with Darwin, there is a long</page><page sequence="13">Arnhart '5 Explanatory Pluralism 289 tradition in science and philosophy of trying to understand the bi ological origins and social functioning of systems we associate with morality. There has been a recent flurry of efforts to understand human morality in biological terms.11 Some of the questions asked are designed to understand how emotion, self-conscious delibera tion, and moral judgment function in social behavior. We can also look at genetics and development for understanding the origins of our moral emotions and self-conscious deliberation.12 An empiri cal, pluralistic approach such as Arnhart's biopolitical framework can potentially lead us to ask new questions and, in the process of answering those questions, develop and extend our theoretical frameworks. One of the great virtues of this approach is its fertility. By contrast, the exemptionalist and a priori approaches seem to cut off inquiry, in particular by excluding that most successful way of understanding ourselves and the world—science. NOTES 1.
