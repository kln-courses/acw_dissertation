<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRISIS OF KNOWLEDGE IN ISLAM (I): THE CASE OF AL-'AMIRI Paul L. Heck Georgetown University, Theology Department Skepticism as doubts about true knowledge is a universal phenomenon shaped by the intellectual concerns and social configurations of the local context. Doubts, also at play in Islam, became a marked concern in the fourth and fifth Islamic centuries (tenth and eleventh centuries C.E.).1 There were many reasons for this. The translation of corpuses of non-revealed knowledge beginning in the second AH/eighth CE century at the latest, particularly of Greco-Hellenistic philosophy, announced epistemological plurality. The regional diversification within the abode of Islam, where caliph existed alongside and in competition with political and mili- tary commanders without a claim to prophetic succession, established a plurality of authority. Confessional sectarianism, the tangible counterpart to theological disputa- tion, pointed to the religious plurality within Islam, not to mention the existence of other religious communities to be found within the domain of Islam, such as Jews and Christians. With the rise of a cosmopolitan Islam, and an awareness of the far reaches of the globe to which Muslim travelers, traders, and emissaries ventured, there was, finally, an appreciation of a socio-ethnic plurality, that is, different peo- ples with different customs and laws that were more or less effective in maintaining social well-being even if not divine in origin. This article treats one response, made by a Muslim philosopher of the fourth/ tenth century, to the crisis of knowledge engendered by this far-reaching diversity. Subsequent articles, to appear elsewhere, will take up three other responses, an overview of a period that struggled to come to terms with defensible Islamic knowl- edge. Certainly, every age is faced with its own crisis of knowledge, and it would be stretching things to claim that only two centuries of Islam were beset with the ques- tion of knowledge apart from other periods. Rather, in contrast to works that show the consolidation and even triumph of knowledge in Islam, our goal is to treat a more neglected but arguably equally important aspect of religious history, the chal- lenge of doubts, by focusing on a particular period in which they were embarrass- ingly apparent (a similar project could be undertaken in the case of contemporary Islam). Here, we shall consider the work of Abo l-Hasan al-'Amiri (d. 381/992), with a focus on his two major works, The Scope of Eternity and The Announcement of the Virtues of Islam. His response was not aimed at dogmatic skepticism, that is, doubts about knowledge of any kind, since those against whom he argued recog- nized universal principles of truth common to all peoples. Rather, his was a defense against attacks made on the religio-moral knowledge particular to Islam, the specific customs and laws of Islam, which his opponents viewed at best as a negligible part 106 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 56, Number 1 January 2006 106-135 ? 2006 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">of religion and at worst as heinous features of a primitive religiosity of the past with nothing to offer those who identified themselves with cosmopolitan Islam. His argument is not, then, with extreme doubt, but with a plurality of truth claims that worked to sow ambiguity, doubt, and division, and he, along with others, took up the problem of skepticism to advance a religious vision more in sync with the times. It will therefore be argued here (and across subsequent studies) that skepticism in classical Islam was used by various intellectuals not as a goal in itself but primarily as a foil against which to argue for a more cogent, more attractive statement of reli- gion than the one prevailing. This is not to say that doubts were not real or troubling. While opinion does have a place in the process of deriving rulings of revealed law in Islam, it was simply inconceivable that the Islamic way of life be based upon a sus- pension of judgment, since Islam has always been a way of life with a transcendent justification. Skepticism in such a context functions to facilitate a transition from a religiosity unable to meet the sociopolitical and intellectual concerns of the day, in this case an extreme plurality, to one that is both more inwardly disposed and more universal, and thereby more viable in its newly achieved ability to account more fully for a broader cultural reality, without, however, doing away with the sense of the sacred as the life force of the religion. It is in this sense that skepticism plays a vital role in ensuring the relevance of religion in changing times and, one might add, even in establishing religious truth. We shall first offer the historical background and then an overview of the philo- sophical defense of the religio-moral particularities of Islam advanced by al-rAmirT. His solution to the crisis at hand was a decidedly metaphysical one, an argument that Islam as a transcendentally ordered system of customs and laws offered what was necessary in its ritual practices and ethical norms for a metaphysical life upon which to base claims to truth. For this reason, it was a mystically inclined metaphys- ics that al-AmirT offered his readers. His mystical inclinations are evident in other writings and attested to by his contemporary, Abo Hayyan al-TawhidT (d. 414/ 1023). The important point to note in mystical Islam is its affinity for traditional reli- gious knowledge. Mystical Islam, like gnostic Islam (to be considered in part 2 of our project), seeks a return to a divine source. The two differ in that mystical Islam seeks such a return through traditional knowledge (definable as customs and laws that bind a religious community together along with its founding story [revelation]), while gnostic Islam seeks this by rejecting traditional religious knowledge. Gnostic Islam sees religious custom and law as obstacles to divinization; mystical Islam sees them as the means to it. The distinction is one of priority: gnosticism as intellect divinely illuminated and mysticism as divinely illuminated intellect. The two, of course, have long existed alongside each other in Islam, both as expressions of an interior religi- osity, seeking to complement or more rarely to abrogate traditional religious knowl- edge as a set of rules both guiding external behavior and marking membership in the community, when such external religiosity is out of joint with the cultural sentiments and scientific discoveries of the times. The cosmopolitan milieu of classical Islam led some and perhaps many of the intellectual elite to look askance at religious practices Paul L. Heck 107</page><page sequence="3">that, in outward form, recalled the tribal life of the first/seventh-century Arabia into which Islam was born. This is not to suggest that there were no developments in "visible" Islam. Indeed, the revealed law-both jurisprudential theory and substantive rulings-did develop in response to the social reality. It is rather to say that the cosmopolitan plurality in which Islam was now located needed to be addressed in ways that revealed law was not equipped to do. It is worth mentioning that the mystically inclined metaphysical conception of religion offered by al-Amiar represented an important first step toward the use of a fully mystical framework in which to hold together both traditional Is- lamic religiosity and the social and intellectual complexity of cosmopolitan Islam. It is in this sense that al-Amiri very much heralded the synthesis of religious law, mystical practice, and the metaphysical account of the human soul achieved by al- Ghazal! (d. 505/1111), to be examined in part 3 of this project. To offer some background: The doubts about religious knowledge that so many scholars refer to during this period cannot be categorized as atheistic denial of a su- preme being; nor does there seem to have been a distinct school of skepticism with its own masters and body of literature. Those accused of being atheist (mulhid), such as Abo Bakr al-RAzT (d. 313/925),2 believed in a deity but rejected prophecy as the guide to action, taking instead the laws of nature as sufficient direction for hu- man affairs. Mention was made of those who rejected all truth, whether sense- or intellect-based. In the first chapter of The Scope of Eternity, al-'Amiri associates them with sophistry (saphsata).3 "Abd al-Qahir al-BaghdAdT (d. 429/1038) refers in his Principles of Religion to a group known as the Sumaniyya, who rejected truth obtained by the intellect but accepted that based on the five senses.4 More significant were those whose skepticism resembled that of Sextus Em- piricus, where truth was not disavowed but rather the possibility of knowing it fully.5 Described as "clever" theologians (hudhdhaq al-mutakallimin), these figures affirmed truth and falsity where clearly ascertainable but permitted considerable room for ambiguity in areas where both seemed present.6 The reference here is not to knowledge of general truths, such as justice, loyalty, and so on, which all peoples and nations affirm, but rather the truth of specific communal customs and laws that vary from one people to another, such as marriage (suitable candidates for marriage, number of spouses, and conditions of the marriage contract, etc.) or commercial practices (methods of concluding, fulfilling, and terminating a contract, etc.). How might one verify the truth of this knowledge? Whose practices were the true ones? A key component of this kind of skepticism was the division of revealed and non- revealed knowledge: what knowledge was deemed necessary by the intellect (ma yujibuhu al-'aql), making it universal, that is, shared by all nations (umam)? And what knowledge was not deemed necessary by the intellect, that is, specific commu- nal ways that the intellect views neutrally as demonstrably neither good nor bad and which it therefore "permits" (ma yujawwizuhu al-'aql)? And was there any overlap between the two? Some, such as Abi Sulayman al-Sijist~nT (d. ca. 375/985), saw revealed and non-revealed as two epistemologically autonomous realms with any overlap in con- 108 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">tent between the two coincidental.7 Others, such as the Brethren of Purity, claimed that such epistemological dualism was unacceptable, making all knowledge mutu- ally related and thus containable within a single epistemological framework. As we shall see, al-'AmirT, like al-SijistdnT, recognizes two arenas of knowledge, the revealed and the non-revealed, but argues that they have a complementary role to play-the first providing communal norms essential to the attainment of the com- mon good, that is, the details of the law by which sociopolitical harmony is possible, and the second providing additional knowledge, the merit of which depends on its usefulness to the goal of revealed knowledge, that is, the common good, which must be the goal of all knowledge insofar as it concerns the interests of all. It was thus a matter of highest concern to the likes of al-AmirT to defend the ve- racity of communal knowledge philosophically against the clever theologians who boasted of having undermined the three acknowledged methods of proving the com- munal knowledge of Islam as superior to that of other nations: revelation, theological disputation, and historical reports.8 Who, they query, was present at the moment of revelation to witness to its claims, especially those that reason cannot support even if viewing them neutrally?9 And, when it comes to theological disputation, one day one finds oneself victor, the next vanquished, making it necessary to admit that what seems true today might be proven false tomorrow, and vice versa. How, then, can disputation offer a method for privileging a communal truth? Finally, historical reports documenting the ways and customs of nations both past and present, all equally edifying and entertaining, leave one with the impression that the ways of one nation are no better than those of another, that is, that the laws of society, be- yond those shared by all nations, are relative and that one is attached to the way of life of a particular nation (here understood as a religio-political community) simply because one is born into it. At the heart of skepticism in classical Islam, then, were doubts about visible Is- lam, the religio-moral norms of Islamic law: customs and practices related to ritual, personal, and interpersonal ethics and etiquette, as well as commercial and other transactions and a whole host of other norms shaping society. Religion here is very much understood as communal ethics, which in the case of Islam meant obedience to the revealed law. And yet, decisive meta-communal criteria for determining that the ways specific to Islam were superior to those of other nations seemed to be lacking, making it a real concern for defenders of Islam to account for the reality of religio-moral pluralism without either dismissing the transcendent justification of the Islamic way of life as articulated through the revealed law (al-sharTra) or disregarding universal moral principles that the human intellect, regardless of cultural specificity, is able to affirm.10 It is difficult to specify the causes for skepticism in classical Islam, especially so- ciopolitical ones, since the phenomenon of doubt in Islamic civilization cannot be limited to one particular period." The Qur'1n itself not infrequently directs its atten- tion to those who doubt its message, especially its divine origin, using terminology that came to be associated with the language of skepticism.12 Still, there seem to be concrete reasons for a heightened scholarly interest in skepticism in the fourth/tenth Paul L. Heck 109</page><page sequence="5">and fifth/eleventh centuries, a time that was marked by significant shifts in the con- ception of Islamic political authority with the potential above all to contribute to am- biguity over revealed knowledge. The connection between skepticism and political ambiguity is particularly clear in the case of classical Islam, where political authority was understood as essentially related to revealed knowledge; it was the political au- thority that was charged with guarding, that is, enforcing, the law (i.e., a jurispruden- tially derived elaboration of revealed knowledge) that lays down rules of conduct for the actions of individuals in both the private and public spheres of society, thereby bringing about the common good (i.e., sociopolitical harmony). This close connec- tion between revealed knowledge and the life of the polity meant that shifts in the sociopolitical order were bound to affect conceptions of religious knowledge. This is not to say that one moment of Islamic history was more or less volatile than another, socially or politically, but rather that a shift in the understanding of Islamic political authority is noticeable during this period. If, formerly, a caliph- meaning either the successor to prophetic authority or the delegated agent of God on earth-was understood to enjoy a monopoly of religious authority (even if the office of caliph was variously imagined by the different Islamic groups, e.g., SunnT, KharijT, ShMT, Ism"TIT, etc.), now rulers in general (presumably just ones), no less than prophets, were understood as "divinely sent" (mab'Oth) by God.13 Arguments for the essential role of just rule in the divine mission of Islam inevitably drew upon Greco-Hellenistic theories of political organization and Perso- Sasanian notions of strong rule, that is, a use of non-revealed knowledge to explain the purpose of the religion,14 a revealed/non-revealed amalgamation that raised the concern that the prophetically based rule of Islam had degenerated into something little different from the rule of the Caesars and Shahs of days gone by, with prefer- ence given to courtly etiquette (adab) over prophetic precedent (sunna).15 It was not simply a question of the delegation of authority by the caliph to his governors, military commanders, and administrative officials, but more precisely of the locus of guardianship of the revealed law, the emblem and embodiment of visible Islam, in caliph (religious authority), sultan (political authority), or emir (military authority). This question seems to have been forced by the militarization of Islamic political au- thority during this period,16 where actual supervision of the law fell into the hands of military commanders with no credentials by which to claim succession to the prophet as the source of law. If, then, military commanders were coming to be addressed during this period with language that recognized them as guardians of Islamic law (even if the caliph remained its final authority in principle),17 how was this to be justified in Islamic terms? How were military commanders to acquire the awe (hayba) and authority (sultan) by which to order a people willing to submit to rule only if fashioned in Islamic terms? This is the question posed by the vizier to al-TawhTdT at the start of their thirty-fourth evening conversation, as recorded in The Book of Conviviality and Intimacy. The response is twofold: either a philosophical argument demonstrat- ing the divine nature of the relation between rulers and ruled, even if rulers do not themselves enjoy a prophetic lineage, making of the ruler a human god (al-malik ila~h 110 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="6">basharT) (vol. 3, p. 99)18 or a mystical one capable of preempting popular discontent with military rule by arguing for God's omnipotent presence over-and thus direc- tion of-all worldly rulers, even if that were not immediately apparent.19 Scholars seem to have reached an impasse amid such social fluidity. The de- mand for a rational explanation of the religion led only to theological paralysis, where differing opinions were rationally defended, as epitomized in the notion of "parity of evidence" (takafa' al-adilla, the equivalent of the Greek isostheneia).20 This does not mean that critics of theology such as al-TawhTdi rejected the intellect categorically,21 but rather that they limited its use, as argued at length in the seven- teenth evening conversation of The Book of Conviviality and Intimacy.22 At play, then, in the many debates of the time was the question of the epistemological dispo- sition appropriate to religion-poetic, a priori, revealed, and thus potentially idio- syncratic or prosaic, derived, scientific, and thus potentially universal.23 There was, however, more to the crisis of knowledge than the scholastic circu- larities of theologians. Scholars of all kinds were confronted with the epistemolog- ical divide between revealed and non-revealed knowledge, between knowledge bestowed by divine grace and that obtained by human effort. Scholars of the pro- phetic tradition were caught in contestation between those who took the prophetic reports (hadith) literally and those who used some measure of human judgment in interpreting them.24 One theologian viewed the prophetic tradition as a bundle of contradictory reports with an unclear relevance to cosmopolitan Islam.25 A qur'anic exegete saw a dangerously increasing diversity of approaches to scriptural interpretation as a threat to revelation's function as religio-moral guide.26 A judge from Basra known for his theological works, disturbed by the growth of the occult sciences and their scholarly mingling of human and divine, composed a long de- fense of miracles as the work of God alone.27 Another scholar, aware of the way in which books as the predominant vehicle of knowledge transmission had forced the study of the prophetic tradition onto the epistemological terrain of book-associated knowledge (e.g., belles-lettres and state archives), composed a treatise in which he defined the written transmission of knowledge in oral terms in order to preserve the methodological priorities of the science of prophetic transmission ('ilm al-rijal).28 The great litterateur Abo Hayyan al-TawhTdT also tried to resolve the epistemolog- ical morass in a short treatise demonstrating the universal interconnection of all knowledge.29 Finally, it must be underscored that epistemological uncertainty was no less a concern for theories of political organization; al-MawardT (d. 450/1058) refers throughout his oeuvre to the politically destructive nature of theological difference and calls upon the state to undertake a theological defense of religion for the preser- vation of the realm and the well-being of its subjects, warning specifically against philosophers who surreptitiously thwart religion when they confuse its epistemolog- ical boundaries by expecting from it mathematical verifiability.30 The underlying concern, then, was that without a credible defense of visible Is- lam, that is, revealed law and its applicability to all aspects of life, the foundation of the sociopolitical order was open to subversion. The esoteric was, then, the greatest Paul L. Heck 111</page><page sequence="7">threat of all-an interpretation of Islam that stripped it of any literal, that is, visible, meaning. One group, the celebrated Brethren of Purity, looked askance at belief and practice at odds with the rationality of the cosmos as known by intellect; as a result, they held that such beliefs and practices could only be amended and comprehended by submitting them to philosophy.31 Isma'TIT intellectuals, a considerable force dur- ing the period, sought to bring religion into harmony with a universal rationality by interpreting revealed texts allegorically.32 This did not mean a rejection of religious truth, but a conceptualization of prophetic revelation as the symbol of cosmic ratio- nality instead of the literal expression of divine command. Nor was it a call to life without moral order, but rather a demand that such order be judiciously considered and not simply accepted as transmitted tradition. Underneath a broad spectrum of creedal affiliation lay contestation over the very nature of true religion, contestation that centered on the extent to which revealed material should be taken at face value, that is, exoterically (dhahir), or reformulated in light of what the intellect saw as true, that is, esoterically (batin).33 At stake, then, was not simply sectarian relativity, since a certain leeway was given to creedal diversity, but Islam itself, especially in its vis- ible form. In defense of visible Islam, a flurry of works on heresy, composed by representa- tives of various schools and confessions, appeared during this period. A genre first epitomized in the writings of al-Ash'arl (d. 324/935), these works--classified as the science of sects ('ilm al-firaq)-had as their goal the demonstration of true Islam, at least as each author saw it.34 It is enough here to examine one example of this genre to illustrate the purpose it served within the ambit of skepticism in classical Islam. The Difference between the Differences was composed by a leading theologian of NTshap0r, 'Abd al-Q~hir al-BaghdadT (d. 429/1037), who wrote in defense of SunnT theology.35 Ostensibly inspired by the widely circulating prophetic report pre- dicting the division of the Muslim community into seventy-three sects, only one of which would be saved, al-BaghdadT opens by summarizing the history of heresy in Islam (pp. 12-20), to show which of the seventy-three sects-not surprisingly the number the author comes up with for the Islam of his day-had remained true to the original message of revelation. The concern with differences is theological, not legal, in line with the prevailing intellectual anxieties of the time, as outlined above.36 How much theological difference could be allowed in Islam for it still to be recognizable as a single phenomenon? It was apparently not even clear who could be called a Muslim, and al-BaghdadT offers a range of views. For some, the criterion was acknowledgment of the prophecy of Muhammad, for others facing Mecca while praying, and for still others the avowal of the oneness of God. But, al-BaghdadT asks rhetorically, what about the Jews of Isfahan, who acknowledge the prophecy of Muhammad, but claim that it was addressed only to non-Jews? What about those Muslims who claim divinity for their religious leaders? Can they be counted as truly Muslim? And what about those groups that differ from the SunnT Islam that the author defends, such as the Mu'tazili, KharijT, Shi'T, and ZaydT, who are not so errant as to be excluded from the fold of Islam, but with whom prayer and intermarriage are still forbidden? 112 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="8">The body of the work has two parts: the first a summary of the sects that still carry the name of Islam even if not in possession of its full truth, and the second a summary of those groups who, despite their claims, fall outside the pale of Islam. Within this second, considerable attention is devoted, not surprisingly, to those pro- moting an esoteric Islam.37 To al-BaghdadT, they are the most pernicious threat of all to Islam, greater than the Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians, even greater than mate- rialists and infidels, and even greater than the Antichrist. The problem with them, at heart, was their attempt to meld together revealed and non-revealed concepts of knowledge.38 Al-BaghdadT is clear about the dangers of these pretenders to Islam: their manner of interpreting scripture empties it of legal content. It is no wonder to him that a group of them, the Carmathians (al-qaramita), seeking to usher in a messianic age with the abrogation of Islamic law, should have stolen the black stone in Mecca as the emblem of visible Islam (which they kept for some years during the first half of the fourth/tenth century). The Carmathians were the terror of pilgrim routes, while a cousin branch, the Fatimid dynasty in Cairo, sent its missionaries eastward, all the way to India. Not surprisingly, their gnostic-like cosmology, which, according to al-BaghdadT, emphasized the eternity (instead of creation) of the world and denied all revealed law, is associated with philosophy, since they went so far as to award prophetic status to Hermes and Plato and to consider philosophy a sufficient source for determining moral norms (in Islamic terms, al-amr bi-1-ma'rof wa-l-nahy 'an al- munkar), and they also denied miracles and the existence of angels.39 Most signifi- cantly, they are said to have viewed as satanic those who performed religiously pre- scribed actions and as angelic those who comprehended their esoteric interpretation of Islam. Like al-'AmirT, as we shall see, al-BaghdadT attributed to them the claim that whoever knows the meaning of worship is relieved of the obligation to perform it. It was therefore the goal of their missionary activity to sow doubts in the Muslim populace as the prelude to the abrogation of the law.40 Their goal, it seems, was to interpret Islam esoterically in order to show its conformity with other religio-moral systems among the nations of the world, thus preserving a universally valid frame- work of knowledge.41 How, then, to ward off this esoteric universalism without going the way of reli- gious obscurantism-an inconceivable option for cosmopolitan Islam? Works on heresy, designed to defend a particular vision of Islam, were composed by partisans of various theologies, making of the genre a literary elaboration of the conundrum of "parity of evidence" alluded to above. A credible defense therefore had to be "objective," that is, free of theological sectarianism. How, then, to show that Islam, in all its legal particularity, was reasonable-not, however, by theological discourse, which led inevitably to protestations of "parity of evidence," but by a neutrally reasoned defense, a philosophical defense using Aristotelian categories of logic as objective criteria by which to demonstrate the universal validity of the Islamic particular? A similar project had already been undertaken in the universal history of Mutahhir b. Tahir al-MaqdisT, The Book of Creation and History,42 composed in Paul L. Heck 113</page><page sequence="9">355/966. There, against the practice of popular preachers who exposed Islam to in- tellectual ridicule (and thus to doubts about its intellectual respectability) by appeal- ing to the illiterate with all sorts of strange and marvelous tales of the prophetic and historical past, al-MaqdisT sets himself against the epistemology of storytelling en- tirely, undertaking the task of writing a world history in which all reports would be subject to a rigorous method of verification.43 Such a history would not only dis- credit the tales of popular preachers but, more importantly, pave the way for a truly moral populace, since history, whether religious or extra-religious, represented the fount of moral exemplars for al-MaqdisT as well as for others of the period.44 The spread of false and fantastical reports as historical truth, therefore, effectively worked to undermine the possibility of correct moral action based on truth-historical truth in this case. Preachers of strange and marvelous tales did an injustice to Islam, ren- dering it epistemologically unsound by creating a gap between the false and fantas- tical knowledge spread by their tale-telling and the religio-moral order detailed in Islamic law and justified by a transcendent truth. An egregious gap of this kind could only raise questions about the validity of the Islamic religio-moral order and the po- litical authority entrusted with its defense. Emphasis must therefore be placed on true knowledge-amid a chaotic wealth of truth claims and fantastical tales-as a very specifically religio-moral concern with implications for both the religion and the state, and al-Maqdisi responded to this concern by composing a scholarly sound ac- count of human history. At the heart of skepticism in classical Islam, again, was a fear that doubts about religious knowledge would undermine the religio-moral life, that is, a detailed ethics founded on and justified by the truth claims of religious knowledge.41 It was left to Abo I-Hasan Muhammad b. Yosuf al-Amiri (d. 381/992) to under- take a philosophical defense of Islam.46 Born in NTshapor, a city under Samanid oversight and known for its sectarian conflict, he belonged to an intellectual heri- tage, stretching back to al-Kindi (d. mid-second/eighth century),47 that took care to account for epistemological distinctions between revealed and nonrevealed knowl- edge, even if viewing them in a complementary relation.48 As was customary among the learned elite of the day, al-Amirn sought patronage in the entourage of a number of viziers between the courts of NTshapor and Bukhara in the eastern parts of the central Islamic lands and those of Rayy and Baghdad in the western ones,49 becom- ing a notable figure among the leading luminaries of the period. Remarks made by his contemporaries confirm what we know from his own works to have been his ma- jor goal: the defense of religion by means of philosophy, both theological tenets of the faith and religio-moral norms, as al-MaqdisT set out to do by means of history.50 Was his an extension of the project of his master, the renowned polymath Abu Zayd al-BalkhT, who had been directed by the Samanid state to spread philosophy among the people so as to give an Islamic coloring to a state with no claim to pro- phetic succession and therefore in need of an Islamic defense in philosophical terms? Or, as suggested by M. Arkoun, was it al-Amir's goal to demonstrate a logical relation between reality and revelation, both to update Islam intellectually and to 114 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="10">protect the priority of the orally recited and poetic status of the wording of Islamic religiosity against its reduction to an emanation of cosmic rationality? Whatever the case might have been, it is possible to note al-AmirT's twofold intellectual concern with (1) the idea of the human, who, as the sole intellect-bearing creature, alone is worthy of receiving God's word and bearing responsibility for it as His representative on earth, and (2) the intimate relation between knowledge and action and, conse- quently, the superiority of religious to philosophical knowledge, religion alone offer- ing a detailed program of moral action whereas philosophy provides nothing more than general principles. The intellect for him exists for the sake of making a judicious choice, a rationally informed option, for the best of all religio-moral possibilities, namely the actions defined by the revealed law of Islam. Heir to both Aristotle and Muhammad, al-AmirT can claim that the human intellect, in a soul whose appe- titive and irascible faculties have been properly restrained by its rational one, will make the correct choice for Islam. At stake, again, is visible Islam, enshrined in the religio-moral details of Islamic law, against the attempts of the esoterically minded to dismiss them as philosophically, and thus intellectually, irrelevant. Noticeable in al-AmirT's oeuvre is a mystically inclined metaphysics. It is not surprising that his own defense of visible Islam appealed to the esoteric, not only because of the strong attraction of esoteric religiosity in al-Amiri's day, but also because of his own conviction that truth is to be found only once the senses and sensible world have been transcended.51 Amid the pointedly philosophical specula- tion of his day, al-Amirl strove to establish a metaphysical language for the extra- sensory experience in terms approaching mysticism.52 This is not to say that he belonged to a mystical fraternity or Sufi brotherhood in any formal sense (i.e., taking an oath of allegiance to a spiritual master or receiving the cloak associated with a particular Sufi "convent"). Rather, he displayed a clear interest in Sufism, wrote on it, and was considered to be an intellectual spokesman for it.53 This mystically inclined metaphysics is the topic of al-Amiri's study of the state of the soul during the period between death and final resurrection in The Scope of Eternity.54 He begins with praise of God for His dominion over godless doubt and turns to the issue of skepticism (pp. 52, 56). The existence of skepticism cannot, he states with fair-mindedness, be attributed solely to the obstinacy and sophistry of those who deny all truth (al-nufJt li-kafat al-haqa'iq); blame must also be laid at the feet of the mounting differences (ikhtilafat) within the Islamic heritage in both theology and law (pp. 56, 58, 60), especially the doubts engendered by theological disputation (pp. 58; cf. pp. 76, 78). The crux of the issue is the perverse way in which philosophy has been used and the resulting perception that it stands in oppo- sition to religion, making it easy for pseudo-intellectuals to exploit thought to under- mine religion (pp. 58, 60). He thus feels compelled to begin with a brief history of philosophy (pp. 60-61), in which he shows not only the prophetic affiliation of philosophy's origins but also its proper end, as illustrated by the relation of Aristotle and Alexander, where philosophy, soundly practiced, leads to both monotheism and political order (p. 74). Paul L. Heck 115</page><page sequence="11">His goal, echoing al-Maqdist's universal history, is to cut short the ridicule of re- ligion and its norms and customs by demonstrating-in partly circular fashion-that religious practice is a rationally informed choice, especially since it is religious prac- tice specifically that helps the rational component of the human soul overcome its attachment to the worldly inclinations of its appetitive and irascible components. To summarize: A soul is rationally perfected when it adheres to religious action, and religious action is the choice of the perfectly rational. The use of logic (mantiq), then, becomes the soundest defense against doubt (p. 96), since its cultivation leads to a refinement of the rational soul (nutq) and the recognition that the religio-moral conventions of the community (awd.a' milliyya) are the most effective means to ele- vate the rational soul (p. 96), that is, purge it of the impurity of its worldly ways and attachments (i.e., the things that pass--al-ashya al-mu'arrida lil-fana') for the sake of an immortality beyond material reality (i.e., the things that last-al-ashya' al-Saliha lil-baqa').55 Truth is thus informed by tradition and is only ascertainable by making a habit of performing the practices enjoined by the (religious) tradition, and religion alone offers the blueprint for the metaphysically elevated human: Discipline in the practices of the religious tradition acts as necessarily preliminary preparation for the cultivation of intellectual virtues, which affords humans insight into the divine light beyond the sensible world, and it is only in accordance with this light that they can accomplish their heavenly enjoined task of worldly prosperity: "He is certain that God has ennobled his essence with the light of the intellect by which he might undertake the task of representing God for the prosperity of the lower world and thereby proceed to become an adornment for the upper world. But if he sullies his essence and destroys his self, he loses this world and the next" (p. 96). By characterizing the rational soul as that part of the human condition that par- ticipates in the divine project (p. 106), al-Amir! aims to put in Islamic clothing the ancient view that the perfection of the soul comes about by cultivating virtue (i.e., moral excellence), which, in turn, forms the necessary precondition for knowing truth.56 This correspondence between knowledge and action, between the intellec- tual (i.e., spiritual) and sensible (i.e., corporeal) souls, when perfected, bestows upon humans a divinely illuminated intellect by which to act as God's agent on earth and bring about prosperity in this world (p. 138). Philosophy as a way of life-that is, the cultivation of the virtuous life for the sake of intellectual clarity-becomes assimi- lated to the Islamic position that the intellect's raison d'etre is to recognize divine revelation and submit to its commands and prohibitions, knowledge of which the in- tellect could not attain without the assistance of revelation.57 Despite the diversity of opinions about truth, it will be found only when the search for it begins with ethical action, making of the revealed tradition, that is, the source of ethical action, the equivalent, al-Amiri claims, of what proof is for geome- try (p. 166). Moral perfection happens only at a metaphysical level, which, again, is accessible only by subduing the corporeal soul and its whimsical ways by religious practice. The work's stated goal of treating the fate of the soul after it parts ways with the body is, then, only a "front" for illustrating the essentially metaphysical nature of the soul: the close connection between the metaphysical state, as the true state of the 116 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="12">human soul, and religious practice allows al-'AmirT to make the unprecedented statement that the human being is religious by nature (inna I-insan dTnT bi-l-tab9 (p. 96), a statement that for him, as we shall see, encompasses the more familiar no- tion known from Aristotle that the human being is political by nature. It is not too much to claim here that this Muslim figure-schooled not only in Aristotelian thought but also in Plato's Phaedo, Plotinus' Enneads, and the philosophical heri- tage of late antiquity,58 the center of which moved with the rise of Islam from Alexandria to Baghdad without a gap-represents an important transition in the intellectual defense of Islam, from the strictly philosophical, which had the potential to undermine traditional religious knowledge, to the more mystically inclined, which assumed it. The Declaration of the Virtues of Islam, companion piece to The Scope of Eter- nity, takes up where the latter leaves off. If he has shown that truth is to be found only in tradition-informed action and that the rational soul is perfectible only via re- ligious practice, he is still left with the question of which tradition, which practice, is best. An "objective" case for the merits of Islam over other confessions will shut the door to both the sophistic claims of clever theologians and exclusively esoteric con- ceptions of religion that reduce the status of revealed law to a merely allegorical symbol of the cosmic rationality of the universal soul. Dedicated to a high-ranking official of the Samanid dynasty, The Declaration of the Virtues of Islam,59 ostensibly an argument for the superiority of Islam over all other religions, is actually inspired by issues of intra-Muslim dispute, above all dis- pute over the necessity of religious practice. At the start, al-Amir! singles out the es- oterically minded who claim that it is enough to know God without performing the duties of religion (waz.'ifal-'ubOdiyya) (p. 78)-for him an utterly absurd notion: "If God's creation of human nature made it limited to the acquisition of knowledge without correct [moral] action, then the practical faculty would either be extraneous or accidental. If that were true, its absence would not disrupt the welfare of the country or governance of the subjects" (pp. 78-79). Is one to build up a society, he queries, in which only the stupid are to act, while the learned remain idle? The ethical life as immediate concern, here closely associated with the revealed law of Islam, makes the work a Muslim reformulation of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. What, al-"AmirT demands, do the esoterically minded have to say about ethics, especially when, for them, knowledge exists-as he represents their position (p. 78)-not for the sake of action but only as an antidote to ignorance? At play here is a deeper concern for visible Islam as agent of the sociopolitical good. What would happen to communal ethics if the esoterically minded were to win the day? Echoing Aristotle, al-'AmirT views correct action as the purpose of knowledge. It is this close connection between knowledge and action that makes skepticism about religious knowledge such a significant threat to what could be called an Islamic practical phi- losophy, in which good leadership-guided by the edicts of true religion and sound judgment-exists for the sake of social stability as the highest goal of the human community. Islam, here understood as action in line with the religio-moral norms of the community, finds its end in the aims and goals of good governance-of self, Paul L. Heck 117</page><page sequence="13">of home, and, at the top of the pyramid, of society (pp. 79-82). While conceding that such concerns are common to all communities, al-'Amiri avoids the pitfalls of scholastic theology by demonstrating that Islam meets them more effectively than any other religion. His classification of knowledge, key to his argument, privileges communally specific or religious (millT) sciences (the prophetic tradition [hadTth], theological apologetics [kalam], and law [fiqh]) over universal or philosophical (hikmT) ones (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics), the first grouping rooted in divine revela- tion and the second in human effort (pp. 84-85). Such a privileging is highly rele- vant to his polemic against the esoterically minded. Since (right) action must be for al-Amir! the goal of knowledge, the first category of knowledge-the religio- communal as source of the details of what one is to do and not do-must take priority since it offers greater benefit to human society.60 This is hardly obscurantist religiosity, which, al-AmirT knows, fosters skeptical responses to truth claims. He actually defends philosophy no less than religion since for him philosophy, logic above all, is the only credible means by which to defend the religion without recourse to confessional partisanship.61 Defense of one entails defense of the other; as a result, al-AmirT takes issue with intra-Muslim debates pit- ting an esoteric universalism against a religio-communal obscurantism, as if there were no other options. Much worse is the disdain brought upon philosophy and even intellect itself from the pointless insults that the two sides cast at each other, when, indeed, it is by means of the human intellect that truth is known and acted upon as the moral good. Without a conception of the human intellect as receptor and arbiter of religious knowledge, advocates of a visible Islam will never be able to fend off ridicule, ridicule that is partly due to blind adherence to a way of life no longer reasonable or palatable.62 The need to show a rapport between knowledge attained by human effort and that attained by divine revelation leads al-'Amirf to consider these two domains, hu- man and revealed, as distinct manifestations of shared categories of knowledge.63 He points out the common purpose of human and revealed knowledge by enumer- ating the various astronomical, geographical, and other "scientific" references in the Qur'an, as well as such things as the importance of musical knowledge to a me- lodious recitation of the Qur'an. Finally and most significantly, he defends logic at length (pp. 93-95) as judge of truth claims: the scale-certain and trustworthy for its justice (al-mTzan al-yaqTnT al-mawthuq bi-'adalatihi)-by which doubts are resolved and the soundness of thought is determined.64 This forceful defense of logic is no coincidence, since it is by standards of logic-quality and quantity above all- that the relative merits of the various religions of the world will be determined. By demonstrating "logically" that the communal knowledge of Islam strikes the mean between the extremes on every point and detail more precisely than other religio- communal traditions, he is able to claim that Islam in all its creedal, ritual, social, and punitive dimensions is the logical choice of the intelligent.65 Significantly, al-AmirT associates "parity of evidence" with the esoterically minded,66 representing their position as follows: 118 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="14">There is no knowledge in the religions which the intellect requires us to have a predi- lection for or consider [particularly] significant. All of it is revealed allegory (muthul shar'iyya) and conventions (awdi~' istilahiyya) that every religion shares and uses for the establishment of its communal livelihood.... If there were any truth in it ..., it would bear a relation to the intellect ... and there would not be such a multiplicity of sects and differing factions. (p. 101) Against such words, al-AmirT argues that the hostility of the intellectual elite to religious practice originates in their considering it a source of lowliness (dand'a). To relieve themselves of what they perceive as atavistic behavior, the elite ground morality instead in what is common to all nations, a law of all nations in place of the religio-communal particular, identifying this purported ius gentium as Islam eso- terically defined. The retort is made by al-"Amiri that such are the ideas of two kinds of people: (1) those incapable of undertaking a complete search into truth who bring upon themselves confusion and doubt, and (2) libertines who want to give free rein to what they covet (pp. 101-102). Significantly, al-AmirT claims that such people live in abstraction with no sociopolitical particularity (wa-hadhani I-rajulani lan tu'raf la-huma mamlaka yakhtassaniha) (p. 102), which is impossible in the end, since people belong to local communities where certain things are required and certain things forbidden (al-amr wa-l-nahy-a reference to ethics in Islamic terms). Those who reduce morality to what is common to all nations will find no welcome in any realm, since their commitment to the details of the ethical life (i.e., the law) by which sociopolitical harmony is achieved will always be suspect. Thus, the details of the ethical (i.e., religio-moral) life are at least as important as the general principles held by all human beings, especially in a society where differences exist and must therefore be brought into harmony by a single law. The "law-of-all-nations" advo- cates actually have no locality,67 a fact that they seek to mask by distorting the reality that moral life exists only in local manifestation. Again, religio-communal knowledge is privileged for its benefit to the socio-moral order. For the sake of the highest good, which includes all members of the community, it is not enough to recognize the universal principles that philosophy enjoins, such as justice, truthfulness, fidelity to one's contracts, reliable trusteeship, support of the weak, consoling the grieved, et cetera (p. 101). Such principles may inform one of one's moral duties in general, but offer no details about the manner and extent of performing them. It is religion (i.e., religio-communal knowledge based in revela- tion) that offers these details. Given the importance of these details to the common good of any community, al-AmirT asserts that even if religio-communal knowledge differs from one religious community to the next, all religious communities recog- nize the necessity of four categories of behavior: creedal, ritual, social, and punitive (p. 102). Thus, contrary to what the intellectual elite claims, universality is not limited to philosophical principles, but embraces these four categories of religio- communal knowledge. The intellect, then, has a share in determining such knowl- edge no less than it does in discovering universally held principles: I mean by this that the pure intellect does not permit the intelligent [i.e., of any nation] to abandon worship of their lord [i.e., the ritual] or well-mannered interaction among indi- Paul L. Heck 119</page><page sequence="15">viduals [i.e., the social] or preventing the wicked from evil deeds [i.e., the punitive], and what the intellect does not permit to be abandoned must be established. Thus, since our incomplete [human] intellects fall short of the knowledge of the details of the manner and extent [of performing these things, i.e., worship, social norms, punishment], this weak- ness puts us in need of One in whose hands lies the power to create and to command, especially since these goods [i.e., the four categories of religio-communal knowledge necessary for sociopolitical harmony] vary in their form and measure in relation to the variety of the nature of nations. (p. 102) Since all communities have a need to worship their lord, lay down rules for har- monious social interaction, and punish wrongdoers, "law-of-all-nations" advocates whose inordinate love for the demands of the intellect alone lead them to reject religious laws (shard'i' dTniyya) actually find themselves at odds with what all na- tions have agreed upon as necessary for the common good, even if differing in con- tent (p. 103). The religio-communal sciences, al-'Amiri reiterates, have a priority over all other sciences for three reasons: (1) true religious knowledge brings about the good for people not only in this world, which is the goal of all sciences, but also in the next, ensuring an eternal happiness that the other sciences cannot; (2) reli- gious knowledge exists for the sake of the good of all, not of a few individuals or of individuals singly, as in the other sciences, making it the science to which all other sciences must be oriented as their final goal; and (3) religious knowledge is rooted in divine revelation, putting it beyond doubt and making it the source of the first principles of all other sciences, especially the theoretical (pp. 105-106). In short, al-'Amiri (1) has taken up the Aristotelian framework of a hierarchy of goods, at the summit of which stands political science as the body of knowledge to which all other sciences are to be oriented as their final goal since it touches upon the good of all and society as a whole, and (2) has exchanged-in light of the purpose that the revealed law of Islam is meant to play-political science with religious science as the highest of goods. It must be emphasized that al-'Amiri, in speaking of religious knowledge, does not confuse the moral knowledge that the human intellect unaided by divine revela- tion can attain, which includes only general principles, with the details of moral knowledge that only revelation can provide. Even if the intellect is able to recognize four categories of religio-communal knowledge common to all communities, the details can be provided only by revelation. One might know by force of intellect that marriage is a good-but can one marry one's sister or one's female cousins, and how many can one marry? One might also know by force of intellect that the thief is to be punished, but is one to admonish him in word, to imprison him, or to cut off his hand? The intellect is capable of reaching three judgments concerning human action: (1) action that the intellect deems to be required (ilm darOrT), (2) that which it permits (ma'anT j~'iza, i.e., al-amr wa-l-nahy), and (3) that which it rejects ('ilm batil) (p. 103). General principles recognized by all nations fall into the first and third categories (i.e., that which the intellect knows to be right or wrong), whereas the details of the law governing daily life fit into the second category (i.e., that which the intellect approves or views neutrally and that can be known only by 120 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="16">revelation). It is in this sense that the details of the ethical life-that which is com- manded, recommended, discouraged, or prohibited-form the stuff of revelation, making it the role of revelation to inform the intellect of the details of the common good: "It appears that the intellect is compelled, in what concerns permissible matters [i.e., category 2], to await the appearance of a [divine] command in light of its incapacity to comprehend all truths by itself and its need in many of them for elements from the outside" (p. 104). Thus, religio-communal knowledge, by which the common (i.e., sociopolitical) good is established and maintained, is the object of rationally informed choice, even if its details cannot necessarily be reached by the human intellect. It is in this fashion that al-Amiri sets the stage for the defense of the revealed law of Islam, some of which might correspond to what the intellect demands and some of which the intel- lect views neutrally, but all of which is necessary for maintaining the stability and ensuring the good of the religious community. The intellect, then, exists to determine the truth, but once this truth is discovered, the intellect must submit to it. It is in this sense that al-AmirT posits the necessity of a "light" as the agent of Muslim unity, divinely revealed and extraneous to, even if the rational choice of, the human intellect; without this final authority, the Muslim community would dis- pute endlessly and jeopardize the sociopolitical cohesion by which the common good is attained.68 Doubts and the social division to which they lead can only be finally treated by the unequivocal establishment of religious knowledge.69 Indeed, instead of the interminable bickering and mutual condemnations, religious scholars, especially traditionists (muhaddithOn) and theologians (mutakallimon), should real- ize that they both have an important and complementary role to play in the defense of religion as the sociopolitical good: the work of the former is to preserve the pro- phetic tradition, while that of the latter is to explain it (pp. 111-122). Without the traditionists, religio-communal knowledge would be bereft of the very important component of its details (i.e., norms, customs, and practices as recorded in the pro- phetic tradition), and without the theologians, religio-communal knowledge would be incomprehensible to Muslims themselves and incommunicable to and indefensi- ble against non-Muslims. Likewise, without jurisprudence-the science between tradition and theology that actually works to extend the details of revelation into new situations-social balance would be lost, forcing Muslims to seek recourse in either (1) an infalli- ble imam-the chances of finding one being highly implausible-or (2) what reason alone deems best, the result being positive law without a tie to traditional precedent-no less impossible in the case of Islam. Here, the political aspect of al-Amiar's philosophy comes out; a philosophical defense of the law of Islam as the condition of governance of society would certainly be welcome to those ruling in the name of an Islamic dispensation but with no claim to prophetic succession: Jurisprudence is a partner of the ruler in the governance of human beings. If the rulers were to turn away from the traditionists and theologians and not seek the assistance of any of them, they would undermine a prop in the foundation of their rule. Similarly, if they were to turn away from the jurists, they would bring about the corruption of their Paul L. Heck 121</page><page sequence="17">rule, for the rulings that the jurists derive-in the arena of human conduct and social rela- tions (mu'amalat)-in rendering judgment in cases of law and dispute, recording official documents, and applying conditions [to contracts] are the equivalent of the affairs of doc- tors who prepare remedies beforehand for deadly diseases, to [be ready to] treat them when the case arises. (p. 119) The fact that the details of human ethics originate in revelation means that all human knowledge is circumscribable within the boundaries of religion; that is, all knowledge is valid to the extent that such knowledge serves the ethical goals of society: Religious knowledge becomes the foundation upon which the rest of the sciences are built, for it is drawn from no other place than the niche [of divine light; see Q 24:35] to which is ascribed the first positions of every theoretical craft; by this [i.e., the niche] I mean divine revelation, which is subject to no doubt and in which neither negligence nor error is permissible. (p. 106) The a priori nature of revealed knowledge, that is, admission of the inescapable parameters of the religious tradition, is the only way to resolve doubts and the social divisions to which they lead. Its defense must be undertaken with the utmost care and seriousness. All that remained-and it forms the bulk of the work-was for al-Amiri to show that Islam's communal system was more effective than any other at producing the good, maintaining harmony, and ensuring prosperity. Intra-Muslim contestation, the source of doubts, comes to be framed as interreligious polemic, a comparison of the religions of the world by the neutral criteria of logic (i.e., quantity and quality), to demonstrate that the choice for the specifics of communal good, known by reve- lation, is no less rationally informed than the choice for general principles of social good. This comparison of the six known religions of the world (identified by the Qur'an [22 :17] as those of the Muslims, Jews, Sabians, Christians, Zoroastrians, and polytheists) falls into twenty subcategories (pp. 123 ff.),70 which constitute the four major divisions of religions previously shown to be common to all religious communities (even if they actually reflect Islamic assumptions about religion: creedal, ritual, social, and punitive), and quantity and quality are set as neutral crite- ria of comparison. What follows is a point-by-point demonstration of the superiority of Islam. This is first undertaken in creedal and ritual matters in chapters 5 and 6. Content that his discussion of these two divisions of religion has sufficiently illus- trated his argument, al-Amirf excuses himself from discussion of the two other divi- sions (the social and the punitive), turning instead to demonstrate the superiority of Islam in sociopolitical matters in chapters 7 and 8, according to the nature of the rule (mulk) and both rights and duties of subjects (ra'aya), respectively.71 Finally, in chap- ters 9 and 10, he demonstrates the superiority of Islam over other religions in terms of geography and branches of knowledge.72 This is not the place to reiterate the argumentation by which al-A'mirT demon- strates the superiority of Islam as a system of specific communal ways. Suffice it to say that he depicts Islam as the mean between the extremes of other religions, thus making it the logically sound system by which to attain the common good. For ex- 122 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="18">ample, he shows it to be philosophically respectable from its strongly monotheistic point of departure, in contrast to Jewish anthropomorphism, Christian trinity, Zoroas- trian duality, and polytheist idolatry. Similarly, Islamic revelation, the Qur'dn, is the most eloquent of all heavenly recitation, while other scriptures are merely collec- tions of human wisdom. Moreover, Islamic prophecy, angelology, and eschatology are all more judiciously conceived than their counterparts in other traditions. Islamic worship, too, is the most appropriate for human existence between this world and the next, he claims, neither discounting prayer as if this world were the only con- cern, as in the Zoroastrian case, nor demanding it constantly as if the next world were the only concern, as in the Christian case, but rather requiring a reasonable amount of prayer, five times daily, appropriately distributed throughout the day such that one might live in this world without losing sight of the next. Islamic prayer is superior (i.e., the mean) not only in quantity, but also in quality, since its prostra- tions, resembling homage to a king, are the most fitting way to approach the true king, whereas the singing of a Christian liturgy begets a spirit of competitiveness and deviates from true religion. To give a final example, jihad in Islam is also claimed as most reasonable in politics, since it eschews the otherworldliness of Christian and Manichaean nonvio- lence as socio-moral impotency. Society without religion, as a soul whose rational faculty has not subdued its appetitive and irascible ones, cannot prosper. Religion, necessary for the welfare of the world, must therefore be defended by armed struggle when necessary; al-Amiri claims that that is exactly what Muhammad did, exposing himself-so that divine truth might prevail-to physical violence by the baser ele- ments of his society, who sought to squash his ennobling message. Again, in light of the close connection between religio-communal knowledge and moral action, es- pecially that which leads to the common good, al-AmirT states, in line with the developments in political thought explored above, that both prophecy and rule are heavenly endowments (mawhaba samawiyya). Since it is the task of kings to main- tain a visible moral order (p. 153), the one who uses rule for the good is worthy to be called God's caliph on earth (p. 155).73 An appendix is attached to the work, in which the author responds to four suspi- cions commonly held against Islam by its detractors, one of which is its creedal di- versity. How could any truth be obtained in a religion so fractiously divided? How could anything but doubt be the result of such religio-communal divisiveness? His response has two sides: one is intellectual, the other psychosocial. First, he declares that truth is not lost simply with the existence of differences, since the goal of the imperfect human is not to be above error entirely but to hit the mark frequently. Second, he posits many causes-anger at the success of Islam, jealousy against its intellectual virtuosity-that motivate pseudo-intellectuals to sow doubts about reli- gious knowledge. He includes among the causes of creedal diversity a disordered love of innovation, the human inclination to prefer witty and charming falsehoods over honestly spoken words, and the production of spurious religiosity for political ends. Most importantly, however, is al-AmirT's own sense of anxiety over charges of shamefulness against the religious practices of Islam and their lack of coherence with the intellectual and sociopolitical developments of his day, and so he says: "It is Paul L. Heck 123</page><page sequence="19">necessary to know that the bane which attaches itself from time to time to the Islamic realm should not be taken as a source of shame for the community of the true reli- gion and that its rightly guided caliphs are not disgraced by it" (p. 158; cf. p. 78). In the end, his is a defense against elitist claims of the atavistic and potentially perverse nature of exoteric religion, claims that he meets with his philosophically demonstra- ble proof of the purposeful unity of the Islamic tradition. To conclude: the work of al-Amirf, informed by Aristotelian ethics, is not simply a treatise on ethics, but rather a philosophical defense of Islam within a larger debate over the nature of Islam and its role as formative agent of the socio-moral order. He argues for a more compelling vision of religion in which the rational processes of the intellect support traditional beliefs and customs. In contrast to the esoterically minded, the integrity of intellect does undermine religious tradition when in contra- diction to what is considered reasonable. It is a two-way challenge, to both the ratio- nal processes of the intellect and scholastic theology: the intellect, to be true to its own limitations, is called to submit to the light of the heavenly realm. Human intellect, partly shaped by tradition, must first be disciplined in tradition as preliminary to metaphysical truth, which, in the context of revealed religion, is associated with a quasi-mystical awareness of a light, a heavenly realm, beyond the sensible world. This matches closely al-'AmirT's interest in Sufism as both moral formation and intellectual vision. That, in turn, corresponds to an emerging concep- tion of Islamic rule as that which is linked to prophecy not by genealogy but as a function of the common good, which Islam came to fulfill. As well, the philosophical argument lays the grounds for a role for the intellect, that is, the rational processes of the mind, in an Islam that is exoteric and visible in the literal details of its revealed tradition, not esoteric and simply an allegorical representation of cosmic rational- ity, as with those against whom he argues. The intellect does not exist to explain away the revealed law of Islam through esoteric interpretation but to recognize the exoteric details of the Muslim community's religio-moral tradition as demonstra- bly necessary for the good of society even if they originate in a nonphilosophical source. It is this kind of argumentation, in which the rational processes of the intellect are assimilated to the light of revelation, that heralds a more thoroughgoing identifi- cation of the rational soul with the revealed word, a divinely illuminated intellect, as we shall see with al-GhazalT. The phenomenon of skepticism, the cause for al-A'mirT's defense of visible Islam, thus played a noticeable role in stimulating Is- lamic thought to a more exact use of philosophical thinking within the arena of exo- teric religion: in the end, a challenge to both the human intellect and the Muslim appreciation of the process and purpose of revelation.

This suspension of judgment about systematic claims to knowledge-"ideology" in contemporary parlance-is meant to end in a certain detachment or intellectual peace of mind. 6 - Kitab al-lmta~ wa-l-Mu'jnasa, 3 vols. in 1, ed.

If He sends two messengers to a single nation, there must be agree- ment in the rules of the revealed law [that each brings]. If he sends them to two nations, it is permissible that the revealed law of the one, in what concerns the [ethically] per- mitted and forbidden, differs from the revealed law of the other, but it is not permitted that the two differ over what intellect and evidence require [i.e., no differences in uni- versal principles acknowledged by all nations]. (p. 163) For an even more radical solution to the dilemma of communal pluralism, see the letters of the Brethren of Purity, Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa', 4 vols. (Qumm: Maktab al-I'lam al-lslamT, 1985), pp. 84-177, esp. pp. 151-156, where com- munal or religio-moral differences are attributed to varying climactic conditions and political ambitions. Sensitivity to communal pluralism was quite strong in Islam, first as a cultural question (shu'Obiyya) (e.g., Ibn Qutayba, FadI al-'Arab wa-I-TanbTh 'ala 'Ulomiha), more broadly as a geographical question (i.e., in- quiry into the customs of the nations of the world), then as a philosophical question (see, e.g., al-TawhTdT, Kitab al-Imta~ wa-I-Mu'anasa, 1: 70-96, and al-Muqabasat, ed. H. al-SandibT, 2nd ed. [Kuwait: Dar Su'ad al-Sab5h, 1992], e.g., nos. 3, 4, 5 [pp. 139-144], no. 11 [pp. 151-152], and no. 17 [pp. 160- 161]). 11 - Already in an earlier period, the phenomenon of doubt was used as a foil against which to argue for a more compelling religiosity than the prevail- ing one, whether esoteric or exoteric in form; see, respectively, al-MuhisibT (d. 243/857), Risalat al-MustarshidTn, ed. "Abd al-Fattah Abo Ghudda, 2nd ed. (Beirut: Maktabat al-Nahda, 1971); idem, Sharaf al-'Aql wa-Mhahiyyatuhu, ed. M. 'Abd al-Qadir 'Ata (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'llmiyya, 1986); and Ibn AbT al- Dunya (d. 280/893), Kitab al-YaqTn, ed. M. al-SaTTd Zaghl01 (Beirut: Dar al- Kutub al-'llmiyya, 1987). See also lbn 'Abd Rabbihi, al-'lqd al-FarTd, 2:208, where the jurist AbO Y0suf (d. 182/798) is credited with the statement, "Three types of people are not safe from three things. One who seeks religion through philosophy is never safe from heresy. One who seeks wealth through alchemy is never safe from poverty. One who seeks strange reports (ghara'ib al-hadTth) is never safe from lies." See also ibid., 2 :217, which gives the anonymous state- ment, "Knowledge is of three kinds: a report traceable to its source (hadTth musnad), a sure [i.e., unambiguous] verse of the Qur'Cn (aya muhkama), and 'I don't know' (la adrT). They made 'I don't know' a kind of knowledge since it is a correct statement." This last statement very much sums up the crux of the place of doubt in Islam, where the only reliable knowledge is revealed knowl- edge, whether a prophetic report or a qur'anic verse, while all other knowledge is never entirely verifiable in the end. 126 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="22">12 - Doubt (shakk), e.g. Q 4:157 and 10:94; ambiguity (shubha), e.g. 2:118, 3:7, and 13:16; and uncertainty (rayb), e.g. 2:23, 9:45, 9:110, 20:282, 22:5, and 24:50. 13 - See al-TawhTdT, Kitfb al-lmti' wa-1-Mu'*nasa, 2 :33: Abu Hayyan al-TawhiTd said to the vizier: This matter, if detailed, would be long..., for the leading scholars (al-a'imma) have discussed at length the office of imam and caliph and the matter of legitimately representing the master of the religion [i.e., the prophet], variously and numerously, in detail and in general. Those who oversee the affairs of the people should undertake the rulings of the revealed law, upholding large and small, according to their known methods, because the revealed law (al-sharT'a) is divine governance over human creatures and rule (al-mulk) is the governance of people by people. However, the revealed law, when not backed by governance, is lacking; and governance, when not informed by the revealed law, is lacking. So, the ruler is heavenly sent (mab'ith) just as the prophet, although one of the two heavenly missions is more hidden, the other more celebrated. The vizier said: I would like to know the source of your saying that the ruler is heavenly sent, for such words have never before fallen upon my ears nor occurred to my mind. AbG Hayyan al-TawhTdT said: God ... said in His revelation (Q 2:247): "God sent to you Saul as king." The vizier was amazed and said: As if I had never heard this at all. 14 - See P. L.

Both caliph and sultan are described as defenders of Islamic morality (al-amr wa-nahy), pp. 153 and 156, respectively, but the caliph is very much irrelevant to the actual crisis taking place as recorded in that evening conversation. 18 - The need for a philosophical argument in defense of political rule in Islam that cannot claim prophetic succession is most likely what motivated the Samanid rulers (i.e., Muslim rulers without prophetic lineage) to seek to spread philoso- phy among their subjects. See Miskawayh, Tajarib al-Umam, ed. and trans. H. Amedroz, 7 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1920), vol. 2, p. 277, and al-TawhiTdT, Kita~b al-lmta~' wa-l-Mu'anasa, 2 :15. Paul L.

One could say, as we shall see, that al-cAmirl's work as a whole is an attempt to expound in detail both the philosophical and mystical arguments outlined in the thirty-fourth evening con- versation of The Book of Conviviality and Intimacy. In connection to this, men- tion should be made of a work attributed (plausibly but without certainty) to al- 'Amirl that treats ethics and politics in a manner that is highly philosophical but still grounded in Islamic tradition: al-Sac~da wa-l-Is cd fr al-STra al-lnsaniyya, facsimile edition by M.

The first to treat it systematically within the theological discipline was Ibn Hazm, who devoted an entire chapter of his theological magnum opus to the question of "parity of evidence." See "al-Kal5m 'ala Man Qala bi-Takafu' al-Adilla," in Ibn Hazm, al-Fisal fT al-Milal wa-1-Ahwj' wa-l-Nihal, ed. M. I. Nasr and 'Abd al-Rahman 'Umayra, 5 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-JTI, 1995), vol. 5, pp. 253-270. Here, too, skepticism serves religious truth for Ibn Hazm, as a foil by which to articulate and confirm his theological outlook (dhahiriyya). See A. R. Brunsch- vig, "La refutation du scepticisme et la theorie de la connaissance dans les Fisal d'Ibn Hazm," Studia Islamica 50 (1979): 37-56, and G. F.

R. McCarthy (Beirut: al-Maktabat al-Sharqiyya, 1958). The concern for the truth claims of revelation per se, without the problem-causing recourse to its human defense, is behind al-BaqillnTi's defense of the inimitability of the Qur'dn (l'j'z al-Qur'an, ed. A. Saqr [Cairo: Dar al-Ma'arif, 1954]), since, as divine initiative, it alone is the foundation of the religion (p. 4), making it necessary to defend its inimitability against the godless who spread doubts about it (pp. 5-9). 28 - See P.

Reference is made by al-'AmirT to these charges, which he identifies with political corruption, in al- Qawl fT al-Abs.r wa-1-Mubsar, in S. Khalffat, ed., Rasj'il AbT I-Hasan al-'AmirT wa-Shadharatihi al-Falsafiyya (Amman: Jordan University, 1988), p. 412: ... especially in this age in which tribulation has grown great due to the triumph of those who undertake political administration before they are ready for leadership and desire [to attain] high rank by corrupt means (lit., force of deception and trickery), plac- ing over the governance of laws the most ignorant of the masses, leading them [i.e., the Paul L. Heck 129</page><page sequence="25">people] to believe that the Muslim religion (al-milla al-hanTfiyya) is at odds with the positions of those with intelligence (hidhq) and insight (basTra) concerning the realm of heaven and earth and the signs of God in creation, and [claiming] that those who in- cline to know something about reports of wisdom or to make use of the ethics of God (adab allah) for deliberating well [i.e., about what is morally right] have been sullied by profligacy and obstinacy and marked by heresy (zandaqa) and atheism (ilhad), as if, for them, the true religion were associated with folly (safah) and ignorance (ghabawa).... 32 - For example, al-KirmanT (d. ca. 412/1021), Ism~'TIT intellectual and partisan of the Fatimid dynasty, who stated very plainly that action not conforming to wis- dom, even if religiously prescribed, was to be rejected.

It is, rather, theological differences that concern al-BaghdAdT: belief in the justice and one- ness of God, His promises and threats, His omnipotence, omniscience, and various other qualities, as well as human responsibility and accountability to God on Judgment Day, etc. 37 - Treated in the sixteenth and last section of chapter 4, pp. 265-277. 38 - This is not to deny other elements of esoteric Islam, such as the messianic, nor the intellectual range within esoteric Islam itself. Rather, it is to say that the in- tellectual agenda at play in esoteric Islam was epistemological reconciliation, as underlined in the account of the Brethren of Purity in the seventeenth eve- ning conversation of The Book of Conviviality and Intimacy. 39 - It was not uncommon to attribute prophetic origins to non-revealed branches of knowledge as a way to negotiate epistemological reconciliation between the revealed and non-revealed. 130 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="26">40 - Fatimid missionaries did apparently undertake to sow doubts among Muslims, but with the goal of impressing upon them the need to submit to an infallible leader (i.e., the Fatimid one), that is, skepticism for the sake of fideism. See J. van Ess, "Skepticism in Islamic Religious Thought," pp. 9-10. 41 - The universality of law or the law of reason has been a common feature of Isma'TIi Islam. 42 - Mutahhir b.

At the heart of the problem, for al-Maqdisi, stand those who dispute without being trained in principles of disputation (p. 1). Such uncultivated disputants actually spread ambiguity about religious knowl- edge and, consequently, disdain for the revealed norms by which God admin- isters His creation (al-istikhfaf bi-l-shar.'i' wa-l-adyin allatT hiya withaq allah fr siyasat khalqihi ... [p. 2]). One could call al-MaqdisT's project historical theol- ogy, that is, history in the service of theological truth. For a full analysis of al- MaqdisT's work, see M.

Heck 131</page><page sequence="27">tiated by al-FarabT (d. 339/950) and variously pursued by the Brethren of Purity, Ibn STnd (d. 428/1037), and many others. 49 - For a view of the period as a moment of cultural efflorescence through courtly patronage, see J. Kraemer, Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1986). 50 - It was especially Aristotelian philosophy that al-'AmirT viewed as the criterion of truth and thus the means for defending all truth claims, including the religio- moral norms specific to Islam. The letters and short treatises of his that have been preserved display a strongly Aristotelian coloring. See Ras.'il AbT I-Hlasan al-'AmirT wa-Shadharitihi al-Falsafiyya, ed. S. KhalTfat (Amman: Jordan Univer- sity, 1988). That al-Amirf's attempts to resolve theological conundrums by means of Aristotelian philosophy were not satisfying to everyone is clear from the opening lines of the sixteenth evening conversation of Kitab al-Imta~ wa-I- Mu'~nasa, 1 :222. 51 - In a story related by al-TawhTdi (al-Muqabasjt, no. 41, pp. 202-204), al-'Amiri is said to have made the claim that a blind philosopher could realize by thought what someone with sight but bereft of understanding could not; against his interlocutor's objection concerning the fickle nature of the intelligent, prob- ably an allusion to "parity of evidence," he insists that thought is specific to the rational soul, which is a kind of divine light beyond the senses and that only there can truth be found. Such a claim must be seen against the back- drop of the rampant debate over every conceivable subject of human knowl- edge, as recorded in the various works of al-TawhTdT. A prominent theme of al-Muqjbasat is the relation between the physical (i.e., sensible) and the psy- chological (i.e., intellectual or spiritual), including investigation into the possi- bility of knowledge apart from the senses, of climactic conditions as primary agents forming a person's beliefs and thoughts, of the uselessness of star-study (i.e., the study of heavenly objects believed to have the potential to affect earthly, i.e., human, life) apart from the rest of the sciences and fields of knowl- edge, and of human possession of a soul as one might possess a robe. 52 - While not fully fleshed out by al-'Amira, mysticism, as the meeting place of the human and the divine, offered an attractive means of resolving the ongoing tensions between religiously and philosophically based claims to knowledge. In contrast to gnostic Islam, it was a way to claim both esoteric and exoteric religiosity. 53 - For al-'AmirT's interest in the mystical (i.e., Sufism), see citations from his al- Nask al-'AqlT wa-l-Tasawwuf al-MilIT, in al-TawhTdT, al-Muqabasat, no. 90 (pp. 301-307). That he was considered an intellectual spokesman for Sufism is clear from Kitab al-lmta~' wa-I-Mu'anasa, 3 : 94-95. 54 - E. K. Rowson, ed. and trans., A Muslim Philosopher on the Soul and its Fate (New Haven, CT: American Oriental Society, 1988). This work does not refer 132 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="28">to Sufism, the technical term for Islamic mysticism; it is not a treatment of Sufism, as one finds elsewhere during this and subsequent periods, but rather a demonstration of the metaphysical grounding of the Islamic religion by a phi- losopher who was known to have strong interests in Sufism. 55 - It is important to note the interest of both metaphysically informed gnosticism (e.g., as represented in the letters of the Brethren of Purity) and metaphysically informed mysticism (represented in both al-AmirT and al-GhazalT) in ridding the human soul of its worldly or materially based impurities as a necessary pre- condition for its heavenly elevation and return to its divine source. The differ- ence lies in the fact that mysticism sees religious practice as the means by which to rid one of these bodily impurities whereas gnosticism sees religious practice to be the cause of them, since religious practice is oriented toward a regulation of one's activities in the world and thus keeps one focused on worldly affairs. 56 - For this idea in the philosophical writings of antiquity and late antiquity, to which al-AmirT was heir, see P. Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault, trans. M. Chase (Oxford and New York: Blackwell, 1995). 57 - See al-MaqdisT, The Book of Creation and History, 2 : 74-132, esp. pp. 130- 132. 58 - See Rowson's introduction to the work, esp. pp. 29-49, for al-Amiri's sources. 59 - That the two works are companion pieces is clear from the reference in The Scope of Eternity (p. 1 70) to the four-part division of religiosity (creedal, ritual, social, and punitive) that al-AmirT uses to defend the superiority of Islam over other religions in The Declaration of the Virtues of Islam. 60 - This idea lies at the heart of al-GhazalI's classification of knowledge. See O. Bakar, The Classification of Knowledge in Islam (Cambridge: Islamic Texts So- ciety, 1998), pp. 155-226. 61 - That al-'AmirT was aware of the need for a neutral criterion by which to judge the worth of positions of belief is clear from the opening words of his treatise on divine determinism, al-TaqrTr li-Awjuh al-TaqdTr, in S. Khalifat, ed., Rasa'il AbT I-Hasan al-'AmirT wa-Shadharatihi al-Falsafiyya, esp. pp. 302-303. Color- ing his entire oeuvre is an appreciation for "pure intellect" (al-'aql al-sarTh) as arbiter of truth and thus the basis of God's claim against his creatures (i.e., humans) on Judgment Day that they had the means of knowing their moral responsibility. Theologians of the day also recognized that religion had to be defended by rational (extra-religious) processes (examination and deduction, i.e., syllogistic reasoning), for example al-BaghdadT, UsOul al-DTn: The revealed branches of knowledge are to be located within [knowledge by] examina- tion because the soundness of the revealed law (al-sharT'a) is based upon the soundness of prophecy which, in turn, is known by means of examination and deduction. For if Paul L.

(pp. 14-15) 62 - For another mention of this concern, see the opening words of al-Amira's trea- tise on the sense of sight, al-Qawl fr I-Absar wa-1-Mubsar, in S. KhalTfat, ed., Rasa'il AbT I-Hasan al-'AmirT wa-Shadharatihi al-Falsafiyya, esp. pp. 411-412 (see note 31 above). 63 - For example, pp. 84-85, where physics and the prophetic tradition (hadTth) are aligned as the material kind of human and religio-communal knowledge, re- spectively; metaphysics and theology (kalam) as the intellectual kind; and juris- prudence (fiqh) and mathematics as an amalgamation of the material and intel- lectual, while logic and language are considered the tools at the service of human and religio-communal knowledge, respectively. 64 - See, for example, al-GhazalT's reference in his autobiographical work (al- Munqidh min al-Dalal) to his work of logic (al-Qistas al-MustaqTm) as final ar- biter of truth claims. 65 - He had made the point earlier (pp. 83-84), that the intellectual faculty, pro- vided it is properly refined (see the discussion above on The Scope of Eternity), cannot choose false belief. This is the case because the intellectual faculty is guided by logic (mantiq) as the peculiar characteristic of the human being (nutq). 66 - That al-AmirT is aware of the dangers of "parity of evidence" is clear from the opening words of his treatise on free will and predestination, Inqadh al-Bashr min al-labar wa-I-Qadr, in S. Khalifat, ed., Rasa'il AbT I-Hasan al-'AmirT wa- Shadharatihi al-Falsafiyya, esp. p. 249. 67 - When speaking of the particular and local, we are referring to a communal way of life: norms, practices, customs-related to family life, commercial transac- tions, legal processes, et cetera-that are followed in a community, which al- 'AmirT defines as a religious community. The assumption is that religion alone shapes the communal way of life. Community, then, is not here envisioned as a political entity with clearly defined geographical or even cultural boundaries, but it does bear a relation to the ruler who enforces the communal way of life, that is, the law, which, for al-AmirT, is, like community, a religious phenome- non in origin and nature, since religion alone not only defines the details of ethical life but also motivates people to adhere to them by reminding them of the rewards and punishments to be meted out on judgment day. 68 - See the reference to al-M~wardT above on the need to defend the religion for the preservation of the realm and the prosperity of its subjects. 69 - Indeed, al-AmirT notes, this is why all groups and nations attribute their knowl- edge to divine origin (pp. 106-107, where it is mentioned that doctors attri- 134 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="30">bute a religious authority for medical knowledge by tracing it to Asclepius, astronomers to Hermes, etc.). 70 - Here, too, in line with his goal of articulating Islam in philosophical terms, al-'AmirT aims to identify religious categories specific to Islam with universal conceptions of religiosity. For example, when speaking of ritual, he says: As for rituals, they too are based on five general forms (arkan, lit. foundations) among the people of the six religions, namely personal ritual (al-cibjda al-nafsaniyya) like prayer, bodily ritual (al-'ibada al-badaniyya) like fasting, financial ritual (al-'ibada al- maliyya) like almsgiving, political ritual (al-'ibada al-mulkiyya) like jihad, and ritual that shares in these four [previous forms] like pilgrimage, for God the exalted says (Q 22:34), "For every nation We had laid down a ritual ceremony (mansak)."

Rosenthal, "State and Religion according to Abo-l-Hlasan al-AmirT," Islamic Quarterly 3 (1956): 42-52. 72 - For an analysis of al-Amiri's discussion of the merits and demerits of Persian culture within Islamic geography, see J.-C. Vadet, "Le souvenir de I'ancienne Perse chez le philosophe Abu-1-Hasan al-AmirT (m. 381 H)," Arabica 11 (1964): 257-271. 73 - For an explication of al-Amiri's view of jihad, see P. L.
