This paper explores the influence of robotic innovations on the boundary dynamics of three different occupational groups—pharmacists, technicians, and assistants—working in a hospital pharmacy. We extend Pickering's tuning approach [Pickering, A. 1995. The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science. University of Chicago Press, Chicago] to examine the temporally emergent process that entangled the mechanical elements and digital inscriptions of a dispensing robot with the everyday practices of hospital pharmacy work. We found that engagement with the robot's hybrid and dynamic materiality over time reconfigured boundary relations among the three occupational groups, with important and contradictory consequences for the pharmacy workers' skills, jurisdictions, status, and visibility.

Introduction Robots have long captured our imagination as high tech innovations. The robotics field has expanded into a multibillion-dollar industry, with robots being adopted within numerous work settings—including fac tory floors, deep-sea exploration, emergency response, hazardous environments, and health care (Lanfranco et al. 2004). The increasing use of robotics is expanding the digitalization of work processes (Yoo et al. 2010) throughout organizations. As a result, the conditions and consequences of integrating such digital innovations into the workplace are important areas of inquiry. Prior research on technological innovations and par ticularly digital innovations has found that they play an important role in reorganizing work among differ ent occupational groups by, for example, altering roles and relations across diverse work contexts (Zuboff 1988, Barrett and Walsham 1999), triggering jurisdictional dis putes and renegotiations (Barley 1996, Gendron and Barrett 2004), and shifting subgroup interactions in a range of industries. The emphasis in these studies has been on tensions and strains arising between two groups. In multioccupational settings such as health-care organi zations, these strains may be exacerbated as cognitive, social, and political boundaries among groups inhibit the spread of innovations (Ferlie et al. 2005). Such groups may also use technological innovations to engage in boundary work (Abbott 1988) and distinction practices (Burri 2008), through which occupational boundaries are fought for, established, strengthened, maintained, con tested, or lost over time (Arndt and Bigelow 2005). Despite some important work on occupational bound aries and innovation, there is currently a gap in the lit erature in two respects. First, we lack accounts of what happens when multiple occupational groups influence each other as their work and relations are restructured around a new digital innovation. We suggest that going beyond a singular or dyadic focus in understanding boundary work and tensions between groups is impor tant, given the increased emphasis on multidisciplinary workplace cooperation that often accompanies such innovation. Second, there has been relatively little atten tion paid to how the materiality of digital innovations is entangled with the restructuring of work practices and boundaries (Gal et al. 2008, Jonsson et al. 2009). Previous work has emphasized how diverse technolo gies have served as an occasion for social reorganization rather, than how these material technologies might, in part, constitute the reorganization. Thus, analyses have centered on how social agents interact to create new forms of work and relations around the technology, and the material performance of the technology itself has 1448</page><page sequence="2">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1449 not been given sufficient attention (Orlikowski 2007, Nyberg 2009). Because robots are powerful digital tech nologies that are increasingly being integrated into orga nizational settings (Yoo et al. 2010), we believe that studying their materiality relationally can yield impor tant insights into how digital innovations are reconfigur ing work boundaries and relations in practice. In this paper, we examine how a newly introduced digital innovation—a pharmaceutical-dispensing robot— influenced the work, interests, and relations of three occupational groups within two UK hospital pharma cies. Extending Pickering's (1995) concept of "tun ing," we focus on the temporally emergent and iterative change process that entangled the heterogeneous mate riality of the dispensing robot with the everyday work practices of the pharmacies. We find that engagement with the dispensing robot reconfigured boundary rela tions among the occupational groups, with important consequences for the workers' skills, jurisdictions, sta tus, and visibility. Our study builds on recent work (Gal et al. 2008, Levina and Vaast 2008) that highlights the way bound aries within innovation networks are used by occupa tional groups as sources of distinction, creating status inequalities as well as sites of cooperation and blindsid ing (intentionally or not) some occupational groups in their practices. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we extend Pickering's tuning approach by accounting for the robot's shifting and hybrid forms of digital and mechanical materiality, articulating how these perform together to reconfigure boundaries in the work place. Second, we examine how boundary relations are implicated in the adoption, appropriation, and adaptation of dispensing robots within the pharmacy, as well as the resulting consequences for occupational groups' status and control. Third, our perspective opens up a new area of robotics research that emphasizes the entanglement of robotic materiality in relation to multiple occupational groups in the workplace. In the next section, we review the literature on robots, digital innovations, and boundaries. This is followed by an account of Pickering's tuning approach and our exten sion of it to examine robotic materiality as performed in relation to multiple groups. We then present our research methods and setting, followed by our analysis and dis cussion. We conclude by highlighting the contributions of our study and their implications for research and prac tice on digital innovations. Robots, Digital Innovations, and Boundaries Robotic innovations have a relatively long and intrigu ing history, from early automata in the 18th century through the industrial machinery of factory automation to contemporary sociable artificial intelligence robots (Thrun 2004). Robots have changed substantially over the years, as have our conceptualizations of them. Lan franco et al. (2004, p. 14) note, "Robot, taken from the Czech robota, meaning forced labor, has evolved in meaning from dumb machines that perform menial, repetitive tasks to the highly intelligent anthropomorphic robots of popular culture." Thrun (2004, p. 11) notes the range of definitions of robots in the field, includ ing "an automatic device that performs functions nor mally ascribed to humans or a machine in the form of a human." Thrun (2004) argues that robots can usefully be grouped into three broad categories based on their prac tical applications. Industrial robots respond to hardwired instructions to manipulate objects or navigate physi cal environments in industrial settings (e.g., a robotic arm that provides precision welding in automobile man ufacture). Professional service robots are guided by humans to manipulate objects or navigate physical envi ronments in professional settings (e.g., voice-activated robotic arms to maneuver endoscopic cameras). Personal service robots interact with humans to help or entertain them in domestic or recreational activities (e.g., robotic assistants to the elderly or disabled). Much of the early sociological examination of tech nological innovations (including robotics) was focused on industrial automation and grounded in Braverman's (1974) treatise on the capitalist workplace: managers seek to reduce complexity and creativity in the labor process by substituting machines for human labor. Man agers, he argued, design technology to control and ratio nalize work, resulting in degraded jobs and "deskilled" workers. Empirical studies sought evidence for this deskilling thesis in various settings (Burawoy 1979, Noble 1977, Zimbalist 1979, Kraft 1979), but results were ambiguous and contradictory, and the deskilling thesis was subsequently criticised (Adler and Borys 1989, Barley 1988). More recent work on robotics has shifted away from focusing on automation and the labor process and toward psychological and cognitive per spectives that explore robot sociability (Breazeal 2002, Sabonovic et al. 2006) and human-robot interaction (Hinds et al. 2004), reflecting the increased preva lence of professional and personal service robots in the workplace. The pharmaceutical-dispensing robot we examined is a hybrid of Thrun's (2004) professional service and industrial robots. On the one hand, the robot is located within a professional service setting (a hospital phar macy), and it assists professionals in their dispensing of medications. In these regards, it shares characteris tics with professional service robots. On the other hand, the operational space of the robot is partitioned off from that of the human workers, and most of the robot's operations are hardwired, reflecting scripted instruc tions inscribed within the system. These characteristics more closely resemble industrial robots (Thrun 2004,</page><page sequence="3">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1450 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS p. 17). The robot thus integrates mechanical components from industrial automation with digital components from information technology (Ein-Dor and Segev 1993). Such hybrid qualities of materialities make them a particularly interesting case of digital innovation, defined as an inno vation enabled by digital technologies that lead to "the transformation of sociotechnical structures that were pre viously mediated by nondigital artifacts or relationships" (Yoo et al. 2010, p. 6). Of particular interest here are the implications of digital innovations for the nature and boundaries of professional service work. In understanding the boundary implications of inno vations in professional work, various concepts such as boundary strategies, boundary disputes, and role and task boundaries have emerged in the literature (Ancona and Caldwell 1992, Lamont and Molnar 2002, Vallas 2001, Wimmer 2008). A few scholars have proposed adopting dynamic and relational approaches to studying bound aries, advocating an inversion of the usual priority given to groups before boundaries. In this view, it is not that occupational groups first exist and then enter into rela tions with other entities. On the contrary, as these schol ars argue, people engage in boundary work involving boundary-defining acts of exclusion, which serves to construct and maintain distinctions between themselves and others (Lamont 1992, Abbott 1995). Understand ing boundaries as relational thus focuses attention on the dynamic nature of boundaries as they are enacted in practice and the shifts in boundary relations that may result. Of particular interest for our research is the extent to which such shifts are associated with new digital innovations. Prior literature on technological innovations has shown that they are often strongly shaped by and sig nificantly influence boundary relations in the work place (Boland et al. 2007, Holmstrom and Boudreau 2006, Zuboff 1988). In the case of health-care orga nizations, researchers have found that technologies can enable shifts in tasks, roles, and relations, producing new patterns of interaction among occupational groups (Aydin and Rice 1992, Davidson and Chismar 2007). For example, Barley (1986) shows how new CT scan ning technology triggered jurisdictional disputes within two radiology departments, changing the task domains of radiologists and technologists and altering established divisions of radiological work. In another example, Burri (2008) finds that a new MRI imaging technology shifted existing practices of image production and interpreta tion, challenging radiologists' disciplinary authority in reading images. Radiologists responded by renegotiat ing their traditional responsibilities and competencies so as to reassert their professional identity and sta tus. More generally, technologies have been studied as boundary objects in knowledge sharing across pro fessional and organizational boundaries (Bechky 2003, Carlile 2002, Gal et al. 2008, Levina and Vaast 2005). Although this literature has examined how boundary objects enable and constrain forms of interaction and cooperation (Barrett and Oborn 2010), it has paid limited attention to how these technologies materially reconfig ure groups' work practices and boundary relations. Recent work focused specifically on digital innova tions has begun to emphasize the important role of materiality in shaping boundaries and relations in the workplace. For example, Jonsson et al. (2009) chal lenge the view of boundary-spanning as a purely social activity by arguing that the use of information technol ogy changes the definition of boundaries. In line with calls for greater attention to materiality in organization studies (Leonardi and Barley 2008, Orlikowski 2007, Orlikowski and Scott 2008), they argue that boundary spanning is a complex sociotechnical activity producing new sociotechnical ensembles that influence organi zational boundaries in both expected and unexpected ways, reinforcing existing boundaries and creating new ones. In another study, Nyberg (2009) explores how the distinctions and boundaries among customer ser vice operators and their computers are not predeter mined but coemerge in the everyday practice of cus tomer service calls. Theoretical Perspective: Extending the Mangle of Practice Building on prior research, we develop a perspective that views materiality as performed relations, rather than preformed substances (Orlikowski 2007), and focus on the multiplicity of views, interests, practices, and hybrid materialities that dynamically constitute digital inno vations over time. Such a relational-material perspec tive extends Pickering's (1995) tuning approach to the study of digital innovations in the context of multiple occupational groups interacting in the same workplace. This approach emphasizes the mangle of practice—the "reciprocal and emergent intertwining" through which human and material agencies are produced in practice (Pickering 1995, p. 15). In Pickering's account, human plans, interests, and activities are shaped and trans formed during encounters with technologies in relations of innovation, and vice versa. Practices and technologies thus configure and reconfigure each other while at the same time shifting the nature of the boundaries involved. Arguing that human and material agencies are tempo rally emergent, Pickering develops the concept of tuning to account for the recursive and unpredictable way in which (human) plans and practices are entangled with technological agency. Tuning is an emergent process of resistance and accommodation that is generative and entails tension. Pickering defines resistance as the fail ure in practice of human actors to achieve the intended capture of material agency (e.g., electrons not aligning within a particle accelerator), emphasizing that this can</page><page sequence="4">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1451 only be determined in practice and through a process of emergence. Accommodation, he suggests, is the active human strategy of responding to material resistance. This includes revisions to goals, modifications to the material form of the technology, shifts in human frames and activities, and adjustments in the social or political relations associated with the innovation. Pickering illus trates the tuning process using the example of a scientist developing a bubble chamber to advance research in par ticle physics. The chamber repeatedly resists the action of the physicist by not producing the desired outcomes. In a series of accommodations, the scientist adapts by building his bubble chamber out of other substances, altering its size, modifying his techniques of experimen tation, and eventually revising the theoretical assump tions underlying the initial experiments. In this way, Pickering highlights that the social (i.e., plans, interests, knowledge, etc.) is constituted through the material, and vice versa. We believe that examining robotic innovations in pro fessional service work offers an important opportunity to extend Pickering's analysis. In particular, such work places are rarely constituted by single human actors but rather include multiple groups of actors, thus entailing a diversity of (often conflicting) interests, values, norms, competencies, and practices. As Suchman (2007) has argued, shifts in agencies have political consequences for the redistribution of authority and knowledge within work practices, thus influencing boundary relations and how boundaries are (re)drawn. Similarly, the innovation in question is rarely a singular entity but a shifting and heterogeneous assembly of multiple materialities. In the mangle, what becomes important is where and how one chooses to make the cut analytically. Our "cut" is to focus on the digital and mechanical materialities of the robot as these play out in relation to different occupa tional groups in the workplace. Thus, our perspective expands the scope and span of who and what is entan gled in the tuning process to include multiple groups and multiple materialities. Drawing on the various insights from Pickering (1995) and Suchman (2007), we examine how plans and prac tices are enacted through the process of tuning a new digital innovation, and how this may reconfigure distinc tions and boundaries among workers as different activ ities and relations become salient. Such shifts may, in turn, influence the performance and materiality of the digital innovation, leading to further shifts in plans and practices, and so on, as the tuning process continues over time. Some plans may be more successful than others; materialities may be modified or expanded; new practices may become possible; and knowledge may be created, lost, or reframed. By attending to the recursive accommodation and resistance that entangles the work ers, the work, and the digital innovation over time, we account for how specific and shifting materialities recon figure the nature and boundaries of professional service work, and with what consequences. We found that such a relational-material perspective was particularly useful in our empirical examination of the introduction of a dispensing robot into the work of hospital pharmacies. In particular, our relational-material analysis highlighted how and why boundary relations among different occu pational groups were reconfigured through entanglement with the robot's digital and mechanical materialities, and with what implications for the workers' skills, jurisdic tions, status, and visibility. Research Site and Methods Our inductive field study involved data collection at two hospital pharmacies in the United Kingdom, both part of an acute-care health organization called Royal Trust.1 Data were also collected from field-level actors such as robot vendors and occupational associations, as well as from documents such as health-care policies (specifi cally, those focused on new technologies in health care), robot instruction and training manuals, and pharmacy procedural documentation. At the time of our study, gov ernment policy promoted robots in hospital pharmacies as a way to reduce costs and errors in the dispensing of medicine. Research Setting Royal Trust has two pharmacy units2 (here called Duke and Princess) located in separate buildings some 20 miles apart. Although geographically separated, the two pharmacies enjoyed a cooperative relation ship, maintaining regular contact and collaborating on common issues.3 Overnight "on-call" coverage was shared between the pharmacy units, so that all pharma cists and most technicians were familiar with both sites. The chief pharmacist, who was in charge of both sites, had close ties with the pharmacy faculty at an affili ated university. At the time of our study, each pharmacy dispensed between 300 and 350 prescriptions daily, and each had approximately 12 full-time equivalent work ers, with 7-8 working in dispensing and 4-5 in distri bution. Our research access was negotiated with Duke, which was in the process of installing a dispensing robot and developing a research program as part of a negoti ated agreement with the vendor for a reduced purchase price. Both the robot and the research program were strongly supported by the senior pharmacists in Duke and Princess, and they attracted interest from affiliated pharmacy faculty. About a year after the installation of the robot at Duke, the chief pharmacist negotiated a similar deal with a competing vendor, and a dispensing robot was also installed at Princess. We subsequently requested and received permission to also study the Princess implementation.</page><page sequence="5">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1452 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS Both the Duke and Princess pharmacies were respon sible for distributing stock to hospital wards and clinics and for dispensing medicines to specific patients based on doctors' prescriptions. The distribution staff consisted of unskilled pharmacy assistants4 who were responsible for maintaining stock levels in the pharmacy as well as the wards and clinics. For the pharmacy, the assistants shelved the tablets, fluids, and other stock items deliv ered daily from the hospital inventory "stores." For the wards and clinics, the assistants picked items from the stock on the pharmacy shelves and delivered it for gen eral patient use within the hospital. Traditionally, assis tants need little supervision from technicians or phar macists; moreover, they do not need to coordinate tasks among themselves. The dispensary staff, comprising technicians5 and pharmacists,6 issued medications prescribed for specified patients. The dispensing process involved four activi ties: screening, labelling, dispensing, and checking. Only pharmacists were allowed to perform the screening task, whereas the final check could be done by either pharma cists or accredited technicians, although the latter were not allowed to check their own dispensing. The labelling (typing patient labels onto the medications) and dispens ing (picking items from shelves) could be performed by either pharmacists or technicians, though this was most commonly done by technicians. This process of going around the shelves and picking medicine boxes to fill a prescription was considered mundane work and was often referred to as "shopping." Before installing the dis pensing robot, pharmacists, technicians, and assistants worked in parallel in the pharmacy, performing interre lated tasks. The pharmacists and technicians tended to work in the front end of the pharmacy and the assis tants in the back end; the shelving area that occupied the bulk of the pharmacy floor space was used by all workers and thus formed a locale for contact, visibility, and interaction. UK hospital pharmacists have been strongly encour aged to adopt dispensing robots. Such robotic inno vations were strongly endorsed by a policy report of the government's Audit Commission (2001). The report cited the potential of robots to reduce dispensing errors and improve pharmacy efficiency, both of which are key concerns in the health-care field. Within Royal Trust, the business case for using dispensing robots was made to hospital administrators by the chief pharmacist, pri marily on the grounds of the robot's capacity to reduce errors and improve productivity. A secondary case was made for the robot helping to recruit good pharmacy staff by promoting the image of a modern, technologi cally advanced department. The first robot was installed in the Duke pharmacy in spring 2004. This robot consisted of two closet-like modules equipped with mobile picking arms and tightly fit storage shelves arranged in a honeycomb configu ration. Subsequent additions to the robot were phased in over time. An extended feed belt was added in January 2005 and a third closet-like robot module in June 2005. Furthermore, a distribution interface system and a medicine ejection chute were installed in February 2006. In October 2005, the Princess pharmacy purchased a larger dispensing robot with a single module. Yoo (2010) proposes a number of characteristics of digitalized artifacts, and a number of these are evident with varying salience in the dispensing robots installed in the pharmacies. The robots were programmable in that they allowed the pharmacists to adapt and mod ify robot operation to accommodate specific layouts and routines. Each robot had a mobile picking arm that could place and remove items from the honeycomb shelves. Although the robots in the two pharmacies relied on slightly different handling technologies, both had a stor age capacity of approximately 10,000 items and used bar codes to store and retrieve items. The robot thus had senseability to read the bar codes and memorabil ity to store and retrieve the identifier information when supporting the movement of the arm in relation to the physical storage or retrieval of the medicines. Retrieved items were transported via output chutes to the front of the pharmacies for checking by staff. The robots' soft ware systems interfaced with the pharmacies' stocking, inventory, and purchasing systems (via communicability, memorability, traceability, and associability). Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the Duke pharmacy before and after the dispensing robot was installed. Although assistants were the primary stockers of the robot, all occupational groups could request items from the robot, albeit through different means. Technicians and pharmacists would use the dispensing computers (located at the front of the pharmacy) to access the phar macy stock system and request items. Through this inter face, the robot would respond as to stock availability and which of the robot's output chutes would deliver the item (two-way communicability). If available, the robot arm would swing across to its appropriate shelf, pick the requested item, and deliver it to the waiting technician (or pharmacist) via one of the output chutes (terminating at the front of the pharmacy). When items were not available in the robot, the technician or phar macist would manually pick the required items from the pharmacy shelves. The assistants did not (initially) have access to the two-way stock system. When they required items from the robot (e.g., to fulfill ward distri bution requests), they requested these in bulk from the robot's one-way direct control terminal (one-way com municability), located near the back of the pharmacy. When items were not available in the robot, the assis tants would retrieve these directly from the shelves or from trolleys waiting to be loaded into the robot.</page><page sequence="6">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1453 Figure 1 Layout of Duke Pharmacy Before and After the Installation of the Robot Outpatient counter lA n Bench worksp; ] telves with medicines! oE □ DD □ O HI D rvTvi Bench and cupboards Plan view: Before robot Front end of pharmacy Outpatient counter Dispensing computers and output chutes jjcu (Sen (gen Back end of pharmacy Boxesywith medicines F 1 'J-""1 n awaiting loading rvTvi rvTvi ^ | Bench and cupboards D&lt;^)q Plan view: After robot Research Methods Our study focused on the everyday organization and per formance of hospital pharmacy work as practiced by three occupational groups. We collected data through site visits, observations, formal interviews, informal dis cussions, and publicly available documents. Our goal was to understand how the plans, interests, activities, relations, and boundaries of the pharmacy workers were shaped and changed during encounters with the digital and mechanical materialities of the dispensing robot. We spent 20 (interspersed) days of observation at the two hospital pharmacies, and we conducted 41 formal interviews with pharmacists (15), technicians (11), assis tants (11), as well as relevant administrative workers (2) and key vendor representatives (2). The interviews ranged from 20 minutes to 2 hours, with the major ity lasting about an hour. Interviews were conducted in private offices or meeting rooms and were recorded. Key participants were interviewed several times over the period of study. Our interview questions focused on understanding, through the participants' eyes, the pre existing practices and relations of the different occupa tional groups prior to the robot introduction; the process of procuring, installing, and working with the robot; and the challenges and changes in practices and relations that emerged over time. At the pharmacist level, our dis cussions also covered strategies adopted by the national association to enroll robots in furthering pharmacists' professionalization efforts. We attended five project meetings held by senior pharmacy staff to discuss implementation strategies and issues faced because of the robot implementation. We also reviewed documents generated by the pharmacy research staff, including comparative studies of "before and after" dispensing errors and dispensary efficiency conducted by pharmacy faculty under the auspices of the broader university research program. We also reg ularly scanned bulletin boards regarding staff news in the two hospitals, as well as the UK health-care field. Technicians, in particular, used these boards to commu nicate about registration efforts with the Health Profes sions Council and ongoing developments with dispens ing robots. Our research sought to answer the question, what are the implications for work practices and boundary rela tions of using dispensing robots in hospital pharmacy work? We analyzed the data in four rounds of coding, progressing from local and situated patterns to cross cutting themes and theoretical insights. The first round of coding, conducted during the fieldwork, developed descriptive categories of the changes occurring in the two pharmacies. Two fieldworkers first coded the data for each pharmacy separately; in this round, we noted strong similarities between the sites, including such top ics as "pharmacy efficiency" and "robot malfunctions."</page><page sequence="7">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1454 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS A second round of coding sought to develop more the oretic themes, producing such categories as "boundary interactions." We then looked for comparative themes, and in the third round of coding, we developed tables and charts to represent and compare data across the occupational groups (Eisenhardt 1989, Langley 1999). We clarified and discussed our emergent understand ings with participants prior to completing the fieldwork. These cross-group themes were then developed into theoretical narratives (Golden-Biddle and Locke 1997) and connected more explicitly to relevant literatures on boundaries, innovations, materiality, and the organiza tion of work. In the fourth round of coding, we explicitly extended Pickering's tuning approach to develop our understand ing of how the hybrid digital and mechanical materi alities of the dispensing robot performed in relation to the work of the pharmacy staff. In particular, we paid close attention to how different aspects of the robot's digital materialities (e.g., programmability, memorabil ity, senseability, etc.) and mechanical materialities (e.g., picking arm, chutes, etc.) and various aspects of the pharmacies' physical materialities (e.g., patient queues, front-end versus back-end workspace) were entangled with the human agencies (e.g., plans, interests, and activities) and boundary relations of the multiple occupa tional groups. What emerged was a specific understand ing of how engagement with the robot by the three occu pational groups in the pharmacy served to shift work practices and reconfigure boundary relations over time, with considerable and differing consequences for phar macy workers' skills, jurisdictions, status, and visibility. Tuning the Robot and Reconfiguring Boundary Relations Extending Pickering's tuning approach, we focus on the recursive and emergent process of resistance and accom modation that unfolded with the adoption and use of the dispensing robot: how the specific and hybrid materiali ties of the robot became entangled with the diverse plans and practices of multiple occupational groups; how new challenges, dependencies, and visibilities emerged as a result; and how the ongoing tuning process served to reconfigure boundary relations among the three occupa tional groups over time. Robot Materialities Two critical and interrelated components of the dispens ing robots' materiality were evident to the pharmacy workers: mechanical and digital. Both were developed by the manufacturer during construction, yet their design allowed for some modifications during operation. The mechanical materiality was the most visible component, with robots incorporating one or more closet-size mod ules configured with thousands of storage locations. Operating within the closet was a mobile picking arm designed to reach each of the thousands of honey comb shelves. The robots also included external con veyor belts: one feed belt at the rear of the robot to load items into storage; three output chutes to deliver requested medications to the pharmacy front end for dis pensing; and one ejection chute at the rear of the robot used in cases of malfunction. The digital materiality of the robot consisted of numerous software programs that were coded to perform specific operations on receipt of information communicated from various sources: parts of the robot (e.g., item detected on feed belt), associated information systems (e.g., hospital inventory system), or human operators (e.g., entering commands through com puter interfaces). The robots' digital and mechanical components were tightly intertwined and interdependent. For example, the motion of the mechanical picking arm was controlled by a digital program ensuring that the arm would accurately scan, identify, grasp, pick up, and move thousands of items to desired locations upon request. Similarly, the number and sizes of the storage locations in the robot's closet were controlled digitally, and by respecifying the dimensions of the honeycomb shelves, the robot could be expanded or contracted to suit different local require ments. The digital and mechanical materiality of the robot thus allowed for some flexibility in configuration and operation, and, as we discuss below, the pharmacists understood and took advantage of this flexibility. Digital senseability was another key aspect of the robot. The robots were programmed by pharmacists to read the relevant pharmaceutical products through unique manufacturers' bar codes. Once the robot was programmed to accept certain bar codes, the assistants would individually scan and load boxes into the robot. The robot then digitally determined—depending on item size and shelving availability—the optimal location to store each item. For example, small eyedrops were put on narrow shelves to maximize the use of space. If the robot could not locate a suitable vacant space, the item would be "rejected" and released through the ejection chute. The robot would also reject items if it did not rec ognize the bar code or if the product did not match its prespecified dimensions. Radio-frequency identification tags were expected to replace bar codes in the future, enabling the addressability and traceability of medicines from production through sales and patient use. The mod ular design and digital materiality of the robot meant that this anticipated adaptation would be accommodated relatively easily in the current robot system. Access to the robot, whether through the dispensing computers or the direct control terminal, was controlled through security codes that allowed different users selective access to functional capabilities. Although the mechanical components of the robot were readily visi ble, they were relatively fixed. They could be changed by</page><page sequence="8">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1455 the vendor or by acquiring additional mechanical com ponents such as adding a closet module or output chute. The dimensions of the shelving spaces could be digitally altered, but this was a time-consuming task, because all the medicines would first have to be removed. The dig ital components were less visible but more malleable through their programmability. As users entered new parameters and codes into the robot's software system, the capabilities of the robot could be modified. This had to be learned, however, which required time and train ing; once learned, the robots' software could be altered relatively quickly. As one pharmacist explained, [Princess pharmacy has] had to do lots... to make the process work. For example, every time...you change that bar code, at the distribution end when they scan their stock list the product doesn't come up because its bar code has changed. So we've had to put in [an] extra bit of programming. In general, the robot's security access codes were set to allow pharmacists and technicians—but not assistants— to digitally alter the robot's capabilities, thus reinforcing well-established distinctions in the pharmacy between the less-skilled assistants and the other two occupational groups. Installation Plans The business plan for the robots' purchase focused on reducing dispensing errors and increasing work effi ciency. These were key government priorities, as ex plicitly articulated in the UK government's Audit Commission report. The chief pharmacist made the ini tial proposal to acquire the robots, and linking the ratio nale for purchase to these external criteria helped justify the investment and legitimate Royal Trust as a leader in pharmacy innovation and practice. Although the pharmacists—as the most powerful occupational group within the pharmacies—could have made plans and decisions regarding the robot indepen dently, they chose to collaborate with the technicians. Together, these two groups visited the vendor to examine the robots and then suggested several modifications (pri marily digital) to align the robot software more closely with local practices. One of the system administrators (a pharmacist) explained the kinds of changes that were requested to the robot's initial specifications: We had lots of discussions [with the vendor] .... We were not going to accept the spec as it was; we didn't want to play that game as the original interface they had was a one-way. [With a one-way system] you may request something... and if it shows up you know it's in the robot and if it doesn't show up you just assume it wasn't in the robot. So it doesn't speak to you... but now it actually talks back... saying, yes, I've got it... . We like our robot talking. The digital materiality of the robot allowed it to com municate with the operators—that is, to "talk back"—by indicating on the screen that an item was or was not available, thus improving the value of the robot as a col laborative actor in the pharmacy. Members of the pharmacist and technician groups met regularly over several months to discuss requirements for the robot as well as the process of implementing it within the pharmacies—in particular, how the robot software interface could be made compatible with exist ing systems such as the hospital inventory system. In this way, the process of tuning the robotic innovation to interests and intentions began many months prior to the robot's installation, and through the involvement of both pharmacists and technicians, it served to distinguish these two occupational groups from assistants at both an instrumental level (who could do what) and symbolic level (whose ideas and plans had worth). In addition to predicting improvements in productiv ity and drug safety, the pharmacists expected the robot would add interest and novelty to their work and free up significant time, space, and resources: It was a project I wanted to do and I'm not saying I was bored with my job, but it was something [different]... and the team of people working with me... were equally enthused about it. (Pharmacy manager) Pharmacists particularly wanted to be relieved from what they saw as the mundane work of dispensing and hoped that the robot would allow them to spend more time doing research or consulting with patients on the wards. Furthermore, they anticipated that robots would be use ful in their ongoing occupational struggles for increased legitimacy and professionalization within the health-care field. As a result, they actively advocated the purchase and adoption of robots, both locally in their own phar macies and more broadly across the country (via their national association). Meanwhile, technicians were keen to develop new skills in using the robot, carve out a new role for them selves in managing the use of the robot technology, and thus shore up their status and authority within the phar macy workplace. The high-tech materiality of the robot enabled technicians to begin to understand their work in more professional terms: It looks more professional. It makes it look better to have a high-tech machine in the dispensary. Previously it was like being in a supermarket, picking these things off shelves. Now the robot is picking for you. It is like a step up... so it makes you feel good. You feel better about the workplace. (Technician) Assistants were not included in the planning process and were less aware of the range of changes the robot would introduce. They perceived the robot as a novelty, and although they were mildly enthusiastic about its impend ing arrival, they did not expect that its use would provide significant work benefits to them.</page><page sequence="9">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1456 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS Loading Difficulties The assistants became involved with the robot once it was installed in the pharmacy. They were made respon sible for loading stock into the robot, a process that became particularly time consuming at both pharma cies. A number of difficulties became apparent early on that contributed to loading delays. Not all products could fit into the robots as intended, resulting in many items backing up on trolleys. Thus, unloading the trol leys could not be completed efficiently (as had been done previously); items had to be loaded one by one into the robot to accommodate the availability of the mechan ical picking arm. The loading process thus dragged on throughout the day with assistants confined spatially to the rear of the robot. The distribution area became messy and cluttered, with large numbers of items scattered on multiple trolleys or on the floor. Not only was space within the robot limited, but also the picking arm could only manipulate one item at a time. With the involvement of technicians and phar macists but not assistants, its software had been pro grammed to prioritize requests to pick the dispensary orders (for delivery of medicines to waiting patients), then to complete distribution requests (for delivery of medicines to hospital wards and clinics), and only then to accept loading requests (for replenishment of stock in its storage). This digitally inscribed operating hierarchy was particularly noticeable to the assistants, who often had to wait for the robot to become available to them for loading: [The robot] takes too long to load. They [nods toward front of dispensary] are the most important ones, and then us [in distribution], I suppose. And then it is loading. So it is about prioritizing. (Assistant) The loading delays were most pronounced around noon, when the hospital clinics sent a wave of patients to the pharmacy. Assistants became acutely aware that their primary work of stocking medicines was less valued than the work of the others. As they saw it, even the robot had downgraded their work. In response to the difficulties generated by loading delays (e.g., increased stock outages), several accommo dations were made. At Princess, one of the assistants was asked to start working earlier (7:00 a.m. rather than 9:00 a.m.), thus enabling her to load the robot with replenishment stock when it did not have competing demands. Similarly at Duke, schedules were changed; the replenishment stock was brought to the pharmacy first thing in the morning rather than in the afternoon, as had been the practice. Another accommodation to the slow loading process was a decision to reduce the number of items stocked in the robots. The chief tech nician made a list of certain items that she felt should be split between the robot and the traditional pharmacy shelves. This reduced the volume of items to be loaded into the robot. Having the stock in two places, however, meant that assistants had to keep track of where items were kept: Before we had one big job to do, but now we have two smaller jobs. Half goes in the robot, and the rest on the shelves... so there is more to think about now. (Assistant) This accommodation, over which the assistants had little control, required the assistants to process data and to multitask in an unprecedented way. They now had to juggle the performance of several activities in parallel— identifying the appropriate location of items, loading the robot, and stocking the shelves—while still ensuring that stock was available whenever it was requested at the front end. Assistants were frustrated that to accomplish these new multiple activities they were required on occa sion to miss breaks and even work late to keep up. The robot's materiality also influenced the physical spaces within the pharmacy. The robot was a large physical presence in both pharmacies, occupying sig nificant floor space. Its location in the centre of the workspace (see Figure 1), although conveniently situ ated between the front and back, also served as a bar rier, accentuating the division between the back end, where the assistants worked, and the front end, where the technicians and pharmacists worked. In addition, the robot freed up some floor space at the front end of both pharmacies, making this workspace more appeal ing and less crowded. In contrast, the back workspace became cramped, crowded, and untidy. The assistants complained about the look and feel of their cluttered workspace. They perceived these changes—along with those of scheduling and multitasking—as undermining their work activities and degrading the quality of their working conditions. For some, it also symbolized a demotion in their status within the pharmacy. In a further accommodation to the loading problems, a senior pharmacist at Duke discussed the difficulties with the robot vendor, who was working on a similar issue at another pharmacy. In response, the vendor developed an extended feed belt for the robot, which was available a few months later. Installing this mechanical extension to the robot (along with the associated reprogramming of the digital code) allowed the assistants to scan up to 60 products onto the robot's feed belt, which would then be loaded when the robot was idle. This improved load ing efficiency, allowing assistants to move on to other tasks even though the robot had not yet physically stored all the products in its closet. Streamlining the physical loading process involved reorganizing the pharmacy workspaces, adjusting work activities and schedules, and constructing additional material and digital components for the robot. The ini tial material resistance to efficient loading was produced by both the single picking arm working sequentially</page><page sequence="10">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1457 through orders and the digital inscriptions that prior itized front-end dispensing. The burden of accommo dating to the robot fell to the assistants. Not being able to influence the robot directly—either digitally or mechanically—the assistants had to rearrange their daily practices and temporal-spatial routines. Over time, the tuning also involved material changes in the technology as the pharmacists negotiated with the vendor to con struct and install a mechanical extension to the robot (including related software updates), and these in turn required additional adjustments in assistants' schedules and activities. Dispensing Challenges At the same time that the assistants were struggling with loading delays, technicians complained of delays in receiving their orders, sometimes with up to 10 minutes of waiting. In addition to loading the robot, assistants were also responsible for requesting and then deliver ing distribution orders for the wards and clinics. These orders frequently involved bulk quantities that took the robot several minutes to pick, preventing the robot's use by others during that time and resulting in a queue of orders from the front end. The robot's materiality had now introduced an important new dependency between two pharmacy practices—the distribution work at the back end and the dispensary work at the front end: We have a very big eye clinic here, and yesterday, for example, one of the girls in distribution was topping up the eye clinic and needed 40 of an eye ointment. So she ordered 40 at once.... The dispensary in the meantime have ordered lots of one-off boxes for patients and they had to wait.... I don't want the robot wasting 5 minutes picking those 40. (Technician) In response, the system administrator (a pharmacist) worked with the chief technician to reprogram the robot to cap the maximum quantity of a product that could be requested at any one time. This modification to the robot's software inscriptions increased the distinc tions drawn by the robot as to what kinds of orders would be processed. Orders requiring more than nine of one item—typically made by the assistants—would no longer be processed by the robot, thus requiring such orders to be manually picked from shelves. The new software inscriptions further reinforced the robots' pri oritizing of work, explicitly privileging support of the front-end work over the assistants' ward deliveries. This accommodation successfully sped up the front-end work for technicians and pharmacists, but the back-end work of the assistants was further slowed down as their pick ing process, like their loading process, became further fragmented. Although technicians were able to influence the robot through software reprogramming carried out in consultation with senior pharmacists, assistants, in contrast, lacked the authority, knowledge, and access to negotiate digital accommodations with the robot. Changes to the mechanical aspects of the robots were relatively rare, yet the need to reprogram the software arose regularly. For example, after a few months of using the robot, the pharmacists realized that new bar codes had become available as hospital contracts were rene gotiated with suppliers or as drug companies altered medicine doses, added new formats, and resized pack ages. The materiality of the robot's initial database design only accommodated one version of a pharma ceutical product per bar code and could not recognize multiple instances of the same product: We had this premarked idea that we could amend the database but... we can't.... The contracts will change and it'll be the end of [many] of the [drug coding] lines.... The bar codes... define the form... but if the product changes from a 28-day pack to a 30-day pack [or liquid to tablet form], it's a different product and it's a new line. (Pharmacist) In response, the pharmacists had to work out how to make product aliases so that the robot's database would accommodate changes in dosage, format, or size. This involved considerable learning by senior pharmacists in particular, as they read manuals and contacted the ven dors for assistance in altering the software code. Over time, these modifications to the robot's digital inscrip tions became routine, and many of the reprogramming tasks were passed on to the technicians. New areas of distinction in expertise and jurisdiction were thus emerg ing from the tuning process. Robot Malfunctions Through intermittent malfunctions, the robots resisted and challenged the anticipated improvements in service performance. When the robots encountered errors or ceased functioning, work in the pharmacy became diffi cult to perform as medications housed inside the robot became inaccessible. Mechanical difficulties ranged from boxes getting stuck on the conveyor belts to the picking arms becoming jammed in the closets. Lad ders were kept ready at hand to enable technicians to quickly manipulate a jammed arm or reach onto con veyor belts to shift stuck boxes. Accommodations to the robot's mechanical failures were accomplished through the creation of new routines in pharmacy work, such as climbing ladders, clearing belts and chutes, and reset ting robot arms. In accommodating to the robot's mal functions, technicians took training courses to learn how to fix and maintain the robots. Technicians previously had little to do with machines or computer technology, but they were now engaging extensively with both the mechanical and digital materiality of the robots: Our work is more technical now... we have to do more tasks that involve checking the systems and doing house keeping on the robot.... [For example,] we have to clear [the system errors] every morning. (Technician)</page><page sequence="11">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1458 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS The technicians enjoyed this new challenge, overcoming the robot's resistance by increasing their own knowledge about the robot. It increased their sense that their work was professionalizing, with beneficial consequences for their work identities: I guess all the medical professions are competing with each other, comparing their various technologies and see ing who has got what. So now we have got a robot. It makes it more impressive. We are not just sitting there, picking drugs off the shelf, but it is a lot more complex. (Technician) When the robot broke down, technicians would be the first ones on hand to try to sort it out. If they were unable to solve the problem, they would call in the pharmacists, and together they would agree on a workaround while waiting for the vendors' technical crew. Over time, the senior technicians' increasing knowledge of the robots made them indispensable, further improving their status: [The chief technician] knows everything about the robot so, I mean, it's difficult to replace her... . [If she were to leave,] we'd be stuck. (Pharmacist) The adoption and use of a dispensing robot further extended the technicians' area of jurisdiction in the workplace. They acquired new skills, knowledge, and responsibilities that established their occupational role as caretaker of the technology. Engaging with the robot enabled the technicians to feel "better about their work place," offering instrumental and symbolic legitimacy for "a step up" on the occupational ladder. Engaging with the robot also sanctioned technician work as an expanding sphere of practice, contributing to their pro fessionalization efforts aimed at the formal registration of technicians as allied health professionals. Altered Dependencies Assistants continued to experience significant frustra tions when attempting to fulfill their ward and clinic distribution orders. Because they had no stock interface system in the back end of the pharmacy (only the direct control terminal), assistants at both sites queued at the dispensing computers in the front end to fill their ward and clinic pick lists. While waiting, they would manually retrieve those items that were available on the shelves. Unaccustomed to collaborating, assistants would issue requests independently of each other. Occasionally, their requests would accumulate and create problems for the front end: The assistants are needing to communicate with each other more.... They can't just all put their stock through at once [or they will be queuing and waiting]. So they need to work together more. (Technician) Assistants' additional waiting time to complete tasks added further delays, interdependencies, and multitask ing to their workload. They believed they had lost their previous autonomy as their work had now become orga nized around the inscriptions, priorities, operations, and processing times of the robot: He [the robot] gets too busy, has too many things to do. There is picking for the ward and then putting away and then when they get busy up there [points to front end], we have to wait.... I can see how it benefits the dispen sary. [Pauses] But you know how it is just easier to pick up a bunch of boxes from the shelves [when you need a few]—rather than wait for the robot to do it. [Pause].... It prioritizes their work, I think. So it can take ages some times to get the order out. (Assistant) In addition, the assistants were finding their time at the dispensing computers frequently interrupted by technicians and pharmacists, who would "jump the queue," generating considerable frustration for the assis tants. Technicians and pharmacists had developed digital "workarounds" to speed product delivery during peri ods of peak use. When products did not arrive within a few minutes, they would go to the robot terminal at the back of the dispensary to release their requested product on the "emergency" ejection chute, bypassing the regular dispensing queue process and interrupting the assistants. These work interruptions highlighted the capability and authority of the technicians and pharma cists to develop material workarounds to accommodate their interests and override the robot's normal mode of operating. Drawing on their knowledge of the robot's procedures and their privileged access, technicians and pharmacists could negotiate a means of improving their work efficiency while neglecting the impact of these workarounds on the assistants. The tight work coupling that followed the introduction of the robot made assistants more dependent on techni cians, as they remained unable to fix even the simplest mechanical jams of the picking arm. The hierarchy of pharmacy work was reflected in and reinforced by the differential allocation of access and tasks to the three occupational groups: It's annoying because I feel like a second-class citi zen .... It is not necessary, you know.... It really isn't necessary to have some having a password and not another. It only causes division. That is what it is for—to separate.... It's not like we're not capable. (Assistant) Assistants perceived a substantial loss of control and discretion in their work, as they now had to wait for technicians equipped with digital passwords to resolve any problems that occurred within the robot closets. The following excerpt from our field notes highlights these experiences: The assistant loading the robot comments, "Oh, the bloody thing. It has gotten stuck." She walks off toward the dispensary in the front end. Soon a technician slowly walks to the back. The technician opens the robot door and walks in, goes to the picking head, and seems to</page><page sequence="12">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1459 just move a box slightly, coming out a few seconds later. She offers a clarification to the assistant about resetting the robot: "The box was out of position and the robot couldn't find it." With that explanation, the technician returns to the front end. The assistant says, "Sod 'em. They don't want to show me. That took five seconds [to fix], and I have to run up there [to the dispensary end to fetch someone] each time.... Why should I care if they don't want to show me? I'll just sit down and have a cup of tea.... I have tried to mention it a few times. But if you haven't been to college or university], they don't want to show you. It is like we are not good enough." The assistant goes on to explain that she has had to call on a technician five times so far today to deal with the [robot] alarm bell. This exasperated assistant felt frustrated and belittled. Each time the robot picking arm ceased to function, an error message flashed on her terminal screen, indi cating a problem. Being physically located at the rear of the robot and watching the picking arm freeze as it attempted to input the stock, she became immediately aware of the problem, whereas the technicians work ing at the front end remained unaware of the difficulty. The assistant then had to go and tell a technician about the problem and request help. The assistant attributed this dependency to her lower status and lesser educa tional qualifications. In practice, the assistants' ongo ing and unanticipated dependence on technicians to get their work done highlighted the occupational boundaries within the pharmacy in new ways. It deepened and made more visible the distinctions between technicians and assistants, calling attention to the unskilled nature of dis tribution work and signifying a demotion in assistants' relative status and autonomy within the pharmacy. New Visibilities Meanwhile, an unintended consequence of the extended feed belt installation was becoming increasingly evi dent. The new loading feed belt was producing a novel type of error: the wrong medicine would sometimes be dispensed: [The robot] is meant to reduce errors. But sometimes we get things that we haven't asked for at all. So we get some new errors in the process. (Pharmacist) The cause of this new error appeared to be digital, but the technicians and pharmacists reasoned that the prob lem had to be human in origin. Assuming that the "robot can't get it wrong," they started to observe assistants loading stock into the robot, monitoring the fine inter play between the digital reading of bar code and the physical placement of the product on the conveyor belt: [The assistants] had problems filling [the robot] accu rately. So the technicians and ourselves would stand and watch them. You would think it would be easy, but actu ally it wasn't. When you were doing it repetitively and there were things that we hadn't realized were inbuilt to the system.. .that made it harder. We couldn't under stand why they were having problems filling [the robot], but when you started looking at it, it wasn't surprising, wasn't surprising. (Pharmacy manager) Ironically, the robot that was intended to decrease errors was providing an occasion for new errors (which were never resolved during the time of our fieldwork). Although up to this point the pharmacists had not been involved in the assistants' work processes, they now began to pay closer attention, and assistants' work attained more visibility. Technicians became centrally involved as well, giving direct instructions to the assis tants on loading techniques as they closely supervised the assistants in order to counter the robot's digital resis tance in delivering incorrect items. As one irritated assis tant exclaimed to the fieldworker after one of these supervised sessions, "If you ask me what I think about that robot, I might bite your head off!" Previously, assis tants had gone about their day largely unobserved by pharmacists and technicians; now they were subject to close surveillance and regular microlevel directives. Some of the frustrations associated with robot use were gradually being alleviated over time, but one phar macy manager reflected that this relief was compara tively late in coming for the assistants: [Assistants]... had a lot of pain before they got their gain.... The [others] had pain and the gain almost simul taneously .... So it was a much more neutral process [for pharmacists and technicians,] whereas the distri bution workers had a backslope... [they] were double keying... and we hadn't appreciated that. (Pharmacy manager) As the assistants experienced significant costs and few benefits in using the robot, they believed the robot had primarily benefited the work of technicians and pharma cists. The benefits that assistants did accrue in the tuning process were largely from mechanical extensions (such as a new chute and feed belt) that had taken some time to materialize: [It took a long time] to get that distribution chute func tioning. We were happy to let it ride because it didn't affect me and it didn't affect what they were doing at the front of the dispensary. It did affect the distribution staff and I don't think we actually quite realized that [it] had. (Pharmacy manager) The mangle emerging from the tuning process came to symbolize pain for the assistants and the gain for the technicians and pharmacists. The disregard of assis tants' "pain" was facilitated by the pharmacists' own excitement over the role of dispensing robots in expand ing their opportunities to do more research and clini cal work and furthering their professionalization agenda. As pharmacists' attention focused on their expanding</page><page sequence="13">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1460 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS professional jurisdiction and status, the largely silent dis tress of the assistants was neglected: We got [the robot] to free up [pharmacists] to take them out to the wards... to facilitate discharge and, you know, counsel patients.... In our enthusiasm we perhaps forgot about some of the other staff, and just assumed that the assistants would accept it, adapt to it... we forgot about them. (Pharmacy manager) The new role for the technicians heralded by gov ernment policy and enabled by the robotic innovation was actively facilitated by the pharmacists at both sites, because they now relied heavily on the technicians to maintain daily operations in the pharmacies. Despite the continued professional distinctions between pharma cists and technicians, there was no heightened tension between them because they were both benefiting from the operations of the robot. Indeed, their expanded work jurisdictions and spheres of control were complementary and allowed them to work cooperatively. The robot's entanglement in their work practices improved dispens ing efficiency and overall error rates, helping both hos pital pharmacies achieve improved performance as mea sured on these targets. Discussion Our study sought to address the research question of how a newly introduced digital innovation—a dispens ing robot—influenced the work practices, interests, and relations of three interdependent occupational groups. Below, we elaborate on the significance of our findings in three different areas. First, we discuss how the dis tinctive materiality of digital innovations such as robots reorganizes the work of diverse occupational groups, leading to a reconfiguring of boundary relations with implications for occupational status and control. Sec ond, we extend Pickering's tuning approach to develop insights into how the robot's shifting and hybrid forms of digital and mechanical materiality perform together in relation to multiple groups in the workplace. Third, our relational-material perspective opens up a new area of research into robot innovation by highlighting the value of attending to the multiplicity and variability of their hybrid materialities as these become entangled with mul tiple groups within the contemporary workplace. Materiality and Boundary Relations Among Occupational Groups Our study builds on recent interest in relational and material aspects of boundaries to focus on the dynamic enactment of boundaries and how these may be (re)constituted through the introduction of a digital inno vation (Jonsson et al. 2009). We thus further develop and offer a more granular understanding of Abbott's (1995) relational and enacted view of boundaries. Fur thermore, and in contrast to Abbott's largely social per spective, we highlight the entanglement of the social and material in the constitution of boundaries. Extending Pickering's (1995) tuning approach, we examined the performative way in which robots' digital and mechan ical materialities (such as access codes, passwords, inscriptions, workspaces, and queues) were constitu tively mangled with human agencies (such as coding skills and dispensing activities) over time. In the pro cess, boundary relations among the occupational groups were reconfigured, generating contradictory implications for workers' skills, jurisdictions, status, and visibility. Consider first the boundary relation between pharma cists and technicians. The introduction and use of the robot allowed pharmacists to maintain control of the dis pensary at a distance and freed up their time to engage in research and patient-centred work. Thus they reasserted their privileged position in the pharmacy hierarchy while also increasing their institutional legitimacy within the hospital. As pharmacists reduced their engagement in dispensing work, technicians upgraded their technical skills and abilities, becoming competent and authorized caretakers of the robot. Prior to the robot's arrival, tech nicians' expertise related to their work with medicines. However, working with the robot required the technicians to acquire knowledge of robot technology—both digi tal and mechanical. Pharmacists were not threatened by this expansion of technicians' expertise and role, even though it involved new levels of dependence on them. The technicians' expanded jurisdiction was not seen as an encroachment on the pharmacists nor was it experienced as a zero-sum game, where the technicians' gain was the pharmacists' loss. On the contrary, the expanded juris diction was cooperatively negotiated—a form of bilat eral expansion (Wimmer 2008)—with the pharmacists embracing the shift in technician skills and roles, as it held positive implications for their own aspirations. In this case of digital innovation, unlike in earlier studies of automation, neither pharmacists nor technicians per ceived the robot as deskilling their work or downgrading their jobs. A relation of boundary cooperation thus emerged between pharmacists and technicians that was recipro cally supportive and mutually beneficial. This cooper ation involved boundary spanning by pharmacists and technicians who were united by their common inter ests in professionalization, forming what Levina and Vaast (2005) refer to as a new joint field. In the pro cess, pharmacists delegated operational control of the robot to technicians and utilized the traceability enabled by the robot's digital materiality to enable supervisory control. However, in this boundary relation, the new digital innovation was not used primarily to reproduce the authority of traditional roles within the pharmacy (Zuboff 1988). Instead, the use of the dispensing robot allowed both pharmacists and technicians to imagine alternative futures and roles that encompassed new forms and areas of jurisdiction. As indicated in Table 1, when digital innovations are seen to be advantageous to groups' interests and</page><page sequence="14">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1461 Table 1 Robot Use and Boundary Relations in Pharmacy Work Boundary relations Boundary effects Cooperation • Collaboration between constituents on either side of the boundary in using digital innovations • Bilateral expansion of work jurisdiction Neglect • Lack of attentiveness reinforces social structures of domination and marginalization • Indifference to the plans and interests of one occupational group in using the robot Strain • Unilateral loss of control • Increased interdependencies and work fragmentation around robot use aspirations, they are more likely to be taken up and quickly integrated within the groups' daily practices. Furthermore, to the extent that the groups are highly interdependent, their members are more likely to develop relations of boundary cooperation during the adoption and use of such innovations. The second salient boundary relation in our study— that between pharmacists and assistants—was far from collaborative. Pharmacists did not solicit input from the assistants in planning the robot implementation; the assistants' lack of voice meant their interests and concerns were not systematically incorporated into the tuning process until quite late, if at all. Instead, pharma cists developed plans and strategies to improve and prior itize the visible, front-end "real work" (Star and Strauss 1999) of dispensing. The robot was inserted into assis tants' daily practices, rearranging their workflows and workspaces and restructuring their tasks and schedules. Their work became more difficult, more fragmented, and more frustrating. The overall inattentiveness to the inter ests and concerns of the assistants resulted in the enact ment of a boundary relation between pharmacists and assistants that we term boundary neglect. Pharmacists, being conditioned by broader institutional structures in the health-care field (Burri 2008), distanced themselves from the assistants as well as the distribution and dis pensing processes, delegating control of these tasks to the robot and the technicians. They became insulated from the assistants' frustrations, as the robot regulated and pri oritized dispensary work through its digital inscriptions. Although assistants expected that pharmacists would help them solve key difficulties that arose in using the robot to execute their distribution tasks, they found in practice that they had been forgotten. As one pharmacy manager remarked, "[I] could not believe that they [the assistants] were there suffering in silence." She expressed concern this could be misconstrued as pharmacists "not caring." Assistants were forgotten because their activities constituted back-end "invisible work" (Star and Strauss 1999), which was more easily overlooked. The phar macy managers' subsequent reflections led to a belated recognition that their relations with assistants required attention. Indifference, focus on more visible areas of work (such as dispensing, research, and patient consul tation), and lack of attention to invisible practices are boundary conditions that may facilitate boundary neglect. Our concept of boundary neglect connects with and builds on earlier literature on boundary spanning by pro viding insight into occupational marginalization. With the emergence of the new joint field between pharma cists and technicians around the dispensing robot, the assistants were restricted to the back-end pharmacy work (spatially, operationally, and symbolically), able to enact only limited boundary spanning in practice (Levina and Vaast 2005). Our study indicates how the robot as a new technology may reduce or circumscribe the demand ing work of face-to-face engagement, allowing super visors to rely instead on remote management (Zuboff 1988). Our study supports Zuboff's finding that the informating capacity of new technologies can be used as a digital panopticon for surveillance and marginaliza tion; it also highlights how this can arise—sometimes unintendedly—as a consequence of who has the author ity and coding skills to program the technology. The third boundary relation to be reconfigured was that between technicians and assistants. This reconfigu ration was characterized by a perceived unilateral loss of autonomy by the assistants. Technicians increased con trol over the where, when, and how of stocking, which had become tightly coupled with the robot. They also used their technical authority to deal with robot malfunc tions or to preempt the regular dispensing queue process. The evident encroachment by the technicians into the workspace and work practices of the assistants resulted in the enactment of a boundary relation that we term boundary strain. To the extent that the work of groups is highly coupled (as in assistants' dependence on tech nicians), the contradictory experiences of both increased dependence and increased indifference may be particu larly difficult for the disadvantaged group. Our study suggests that the interlinking and shifting of workplace jurisdictions between the technicians and assistants was not a planned strategy of labor differ entiation but a consequence of the relational-material tuning process. In particular, our analysis suggests that asymmetrical expertise, increased dependency, height ened status inequality, and workspace and task encroach ment are critical conditions for the production of strained boundary relations. As Table 1 highlights, the changing status and role of the technicians as primary caretakers of the robot shifted the focus and emphasis of their work. The robot enabled an expansion of their jurisdictions and simultaneously increased their authority, control, and scrutiny of the assistants' practice (Jonsson et al. 2009). Assistants perceived these distinctions as increasing the institutional and symbolic divisions between occupations (Lamont and Molnar 2002) and reifying the differences in educational levels among workers (Vallas 2001).</page><page sequence="15">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1462 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS Hybrid Materiality and the Ttaning Process A second area of contribution concerns the role of mate riality in digital innovations (Jonsson et al. 2009, Yoo et al. 2010). Our perspective highlights the importance of understanding shifting and hybrid forms of materiality as these are performed in relation to the interests and prac tices of multiple occupational groups. As digital innova tions are increasingly combining digital and mechanical components in novel ways (as in robot technologies), accounting for the dynamic interrelationships and inter dependencies between digital and mechanical materiali ties and workplace practices and relations will improve our understanding of organizing for digital innovation. In focusing on the multiple relational and material dynamics entailed in the adoption and integration of the dispensing robot over time, we found that the different components of the robot led to important differences in the scope and speed of responsiveness available during the tuning process. For example, the slow loading of the robot led pharmacists to ask the vendor to design, build, and install a new intake conveyor belt for the robot, a task that took a number of months to complete. In con trast, the digital aspects of the robot could be altered rapidly through changes in software inscriptions. When the assistants' large picking orders blocked dispensing work at the front end, the system administrator (a phar macist) digitally limited the number of items that could be picked in one order. By the very next day, the robot worked differently, with significant implications for the performance of work within the pharmacy and the rel ative control and status of the assistants. The system administrator tweaked some digital components in this case, but the overall effect was accomplished through a change in the operation of the mechanical picking arm. The digital and mechanical components of the robot are thus deeply intertwined in practice, emphasizing that any distinction of the robot's digital and mechanical materi alities can be analytic only. Who gets to manipulate and control different forms of materiality, and how, has important implications for how boundaries and jurisdictions are influenced and recon figured in the tuning process. For example, although engineers in a distant vendor facility largely defined and developed modifications to the robot's mechanical aspects, members of two of the occupational groups in the pharmacy could alter some of its digital inscriptions. Because modifying the mechanical aspects of the robot took time, the problems with these components were not easily solved, and cumbersome workarounds had to be developed. In contrast, the robot's digital inscriptions could often be adapted in concert with the problems arising in practice, resulting in an expansion of techni cians' and pharmacists' jurisdictional boundaries and a concomitant loss of control by assistants, who were not given access or training to communicate with the robot. The digital materiality of the dispensing robot thus facilitated problem diagnosis and solution generation among technicians and pharmacists during the tuning process. By working collaboratively to produce digi tal solutions, technicians and pharmacists were able to build on each other's insights and increase their creative engagement in practice (Sennett 2008). Team meetings during the adoption process and subsequent troubleshoot ing sessions focused on how the robot could be digi tally altered so as to redirect its operations to be more aligned with the interests of improving dispensing work. Had these meetings been constituted by a different mem bership, or had the assistants been given access to and training on the robot, then the emerging entanglement could have been quite different. For example, the effi ciency of distribution work and the working conditions of assistants may have become more salient in the tuning process, leading to alternative activities and outcomes. Furthermore, the digital materiality of the dispensing robot became a significant sphere and rationale for col laboration across Duke and Princess. Digital solutions developed in one pharmacy—and legitimized by broader institutional assumptions and shared interests concerning access, knowledge, and responsibility—could be shared with the other pharmacy (in ways that the mechani cal components could not). We suggest that the relative mobility of the digital materiality in this case is a key reason for the strong similarities observed in the tuning process and outcomes at the two pharmacies, in con trast to the differences across sites observed in Barley's (1986) research. The configuration and flexibility of the robot materi alities evident in our study are highly situated and tem porally emergent. That the digital components of the dispensing robot allowed skilled workers to reprogram software inscriptions reflected the particular design of this digital innovation and its specific deployment in the hospital pharmacies. Other digital materialities might be designed and built to be less malleable by operators in the field. Similarly, the particular form of the mechanical materiality in this case meant that it was quite difficult and time consuming to modify in practice. Again, this will vary depending on the technology at hand, and it is always an empirical matter. It is worth noting that as more artifacts become embedded with digital capabili ties, it is likely that some will allow for more rather than less manipulation in practice—whether through repro gramming of code, alteration of data fields, or integra tion with other systems and devices (Yoo et al. 2010). It is also important, of course, to recognize that some changes in digital components might entail considerable time, effort, and specialized expertise (e.g., implement ing a complete upgrade of the robot's system software). As a large object, the physicality and spatial posi tioning of the robot also influenced the tuning process by more visibly demarcating and separating the front and back ends of the pharmacy. Spatial work paths of</page><page sequence="16">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1463 all groups were altered, with pharmacists and techni cians largely positioned at the front end and assistants restricted to the back. The physical segregation pro moted the work efficiency of the pharmacy's dispens ing work while slowing and fragmenting its distribution work. The back of the pharmacy became more cluttered and messy, contributing to the assistants' frustration and demoralization. The robot's entanglement with the phys ical materiality of the pharmacy's workspaces thus had both operational and symbolic implications for occupa tional status, (in)visibility, and performance. Although pharmacists enjoyed identity-shaping devel opments that enhanced their professionalism, assistants experienced more of a "sharp social edge" (Sennett 2008, p. 44). As lower-status workers, they found that their work goals and interests were disrupted and even undermined. Many assistants chose pharmacy work because they could "just get on with their job" and take charge of their own schedules. In their encounters with the robot in practice, they increased their depen dence on and coordination with other workers and lost both autonomy and control. Earlier work has shown how digital innovations may alter organizational identi ties (Gal et al. 2008); our study complements this work by showing how digital innovations can also shape occu pational identities. The altered dependencies, jurisdic tions, and relations evident here were not the direct result of the digital innovation per se, nor did they reflect the purposeful strategy of control over labor by man agers (as argued by labor process scholars). Rather, the perspective we have developed here suggests that the shifts in occupational status and worth emerged from the entangled relational-material dynamics that constituted the robot tuning process over time. Relational-Material Perspective on Robot Innovations Our study also offers an important contribution to hybrid robots and the broader robotics literature. Hybrid robots with aspects of professional services and indus trial robots (Thrun 2004) encourage the development of a sociological lens with which to empirically view robotic innovations in the workplace. This is an impor tant yet neglected dimension within the robotics liter ature, which has tended to focus either on automation studies of industrial robots and the labor process or on cognitive studies of human-robot interfaces and inter actions (Hinds et al. 2004). Our relational-material per spective enables an understanding of how the multiple digital and mechanical materialities of robots are per formed in practice and in relation to the multiple differ ent occupational groups that engage with them. We also provide insights into the nature of human robot interactions, another area of robotics research. In our case, two occupational groups with access to the digital materiality of the robot could shape their interac tions with it to their advantage. For example, early on, pharmacists requested that the vendor program software allow the robots to "talk back" to the pharmacists and technicians in the front of the dispensary. This changed the robot's communication from a unidirectional to a bidirectional mode, allowing pharmacists and techni cians to engage with the robot in a more collabora tive manner, seeing it as another "team member." In another case, modifications of the robot's digital inscrip tions allowed capping the size of orders, thus favoring pharmacists and technicians while limiting the interac tion of the assistants with the robot and highlighting their second-class status. These boundary-shaping interactions that we have identified suggest the need for robotics research to go beyond the traditional focus on human-machine interac tions and degree of autonomy of the robot (Thrun 2004). In particular, our study suggests the value of understand ing the multiplicity and variability of robot materialities, as these are entangled with the multiple occupational groups found in contemporary workplaces. As we have shown, these engagements and their consequences are unlikely to be singular or homogeneous, and they are likely to produce a range of boundary dynamics and unintended outcomes for the particular groups involved. Conclusion and Implications Yoo et al. (2010, p. 16) argue that understanding digi tal innovations requires that "scholars must take digital materiality seriously," exploring how "digital and phys ical materiality become intertwined" in practice. In this paper, we examined how the different forms of mate riality constituting a novel digital innovation influenced the work practices and boundary relations of disparate occupational groups. Extending Pickering's (1995) tun ing approach, we developed a relational-material per spective to examine the temporally emergent process that entangled the hybrid materialities of the digital inno vation with the everyday work practices and boundary relations of the groups involved. By studying the tun ing process entailed in coming to grips with dynamic materialities over time, we identified and explored how and why boundary relations among three occupational groups were reconfigured, with important consequences for the workers' jurisdictions, skills, status, and visibil ity. We suggest six implications of these insights. First, our relational-material perspective identifies and accounts for different forms of materiality associated with digital innovations. Recently, there has been grow ing interest in taking materiality more seriously in orga nization studies (Jonsson et al. 2009, Leonardi and Barley 2008, Orlikowski and Scott 2008), and our study highlights the value of viewing materiality as performed relations. In particular, we found it useful to articulate</page><page sequence="17">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work 1464 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS the different but interdependent forms of materiality— digital and mechanical—that constitute robotic innova tions. Our perspective can thus shed some light on how different specific materialities of digital innovations are performed in practice through being engaged and changed by different groups in the ongoing accommo dations and resistances of the tuning process. Our perspective further allows recognition and exam ination of the hybridity and fluidity of materialities in practice (Latour 2005). The materialities of digital inno vations are unlikely to be singular or static, and paying attention to ongoing processes of tuning affords an under standing of materialities as multiple and dynamic over time. Yoo et al. (2010) discuss a number of characteristics of digital materiality (e.g., programmability, senseability, communicability) that are prioritized in the design pro cess, and we found these useful in making sense of the robots in our study. Of particular value was understand ing how these designed characteristics were performed in practice as a result of the tuning process and with what particular consequences. As we saw, the actualization of particular digital materialities in situated practices is nei ther inevitable nor necessarily associated with some pre determined outcomes; rather, these are relational enact ments that are both temporally emergent and associated with multiple and contradictory outcomes over time. Second, we extend Pickering's (1995) tuning approach to understand the accommodations and resistances of humans and technology, going beyond his view in two significant ways. We emphasize that the actors and tech nologies entangled in the tuning process are both mul tiple and heterogeneous, thus expanding the scope and span of who and what is mangled in practice. Further more, whereas Pickering frames accommodation as a human strategy of responding to material resistance, we suggest that accommodation and resistance should be understood relationally and as emerging in practice. In our study, we found instances of both humans accommo dating (e.g., changing software code) to robot resistance (e.g., loading delays caused by the sequential motion of the mechanical picking arm), as well as humans resist ing the inscribed material agency (e.g., when technicians bypassed the dispensing queue to release their requested product on the "emergency" chute). Retaining an open ended view about who or what is accommodating and resisting should allow for additional analytical insights as increasingly novel digital innovations become entan gled in practice with an increasing array of multiple, distributed, and shifting agencies. Third, we showed how the adoption and use of a robotic innovation by multiple occupational groups can reconfigure the boundary relations among them, with important implications for work practices, roles, and sta tus. Previous work has pointed out how professional groups may stymie the diffusion of innovation (Ferlie et al. 2005). In contrast, our findings highlight how a digital innovation may be used by certain occupational groups to expand their jurisdictions, expertise, and pro fessional standing. The alignment of the robotic inno vation with the pharmacists' professionalization interests and their ongoing accommodations, in particular, to the digital materiality of the robot was integral in further ing the adoption, appropriation, and adaptation of the digital innovation over time. Similarly, the technicians' increased knowledge and control over the robot promoted their occupational authority and prestige, and these rein forced their expanding role as caretaker of the new digital innovation. In contrast, assistants' work practices became increasingly dependent on both the robot and the techni cians, and they lost control over their schedules and work tasks in the process. These varied findings highlight the importance of attending to the many disparate and sit uated ways multiple groups' plans, interests, practices, and relations become entangled with the materiality of the digital innovation in the tuning process. Fourth, we identified the reconfiguration of three boundary relations that were implicated in the adoption and integration of a dispensing robot within pharmacy work and suggested some conditions under which these might occur. In examining this reshaping of boundary relations, we go beyond the previous emphasis on bound ary cooperation and conflict (e.g., Barley 1986, Vallas 2001) to articulate how boundaries are actively reconfig ured, both relationally and materially, in the tuning pro cess. This analysis allowed us to identify how these recur sive relational-material dynamics produced contradictory implications, generating cooperation in one boundary relation while producing neglect or strain in others. This points to the importance of examining the complex, shift ing boundary relations that are enacted with new mate rialities across multiple groups, and it suggests attending not just to the more dramatic boundary relations of coop eration and conflict but also to the more subtle and less visible ones of strain and neglect. Fifth, we articulated the entanglement of the robot's materiality with groups' status, control, and autonomy, thus extending understanding of the relational-material dynamics and contradictory effects associated with digi tal innovations in practice. The enactment of cooperative relations between two, occupational groups around the robot allowed the groups to increase their skills, author ity, and agentic opportunities. At the same time, another set of relations was being enacted through engagement with the robot that generated negative consequences for the autonomy, visibility, dependence, and morale of a third occupational group. Our findings suggest that although particular digital innovations may be used to enhance occupational groups' intellectual and sym bolic value, they may also provide a sharp social edge that produces diminished forms of occupational worth (Sennett 2008). Finally, our study has emphasized the importance of looking at multiple boundaries in the ecology of</page><page sequence="18">Barrett et al.: Reconfiguring Boundary Relations: Robotic Innovations in Pharmacy Work Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1448-1466, ©2012 INFORMS 1465 interactions across different occupational groups in the workplace. Existing research has tended to employ a dyadic focus in understanding boundary work, but, given the increased emphasis on multidisciplinary collabora tion, contemporary workplaces are likely to include mul tiple groups of actors with a diversity of interests, values, competencies, and practices. The perspective we have developed here expands the scope and span of who and what is entangled in the tuning process to include mul tiple groups and multiple materialities. We note that our findings are limited to the extent that we only exam ined the adoption of one specific digital innovation in a particular organizational context, but we believe our insights are valuable and generative. Future research is now needed to verify and elaborate on them, as well as to examine how boundary relations are reconfigured in other contexts and with other digital innovations.

Endnotes 'The names of all institutions and individuals have been dis guised. 2The units studied were called "dispensaries" in the hospitals, as they are a subsection of the total pharmacy department, which includes such activities as aseptic preparations, ward rounds, stores, and purchasing, and research and education. We only focused on the dispensing activities in this study. 3In this respect, our hospital site differs from that in Barley's (1986) study of CT scanners, where the two hospitals had no formal relationship or regular contact. In our case, techni cians and pharmacists at Duke and Princess frequently worked together to solve issues arising from use of the dispens ing robot. 4Assistants are not expected to have any prior training before starting their jobs. technicians are members of a national body for licensed health-care professionals in the United Kingdom—the Health care Professions Council, or HPC. They are required to have a minimum of two years of practical college training that emphasizes accuracy in identifying and dispensing medicines. It is noteworthy that at the time of this study, technicians' training did not include topics related to technology or sys tems but was focused on techniques for correctly managing medications. 6Pharmacists are required to complete at least four years of university education and a subsequent practical training year before being licensed to practice independently.
