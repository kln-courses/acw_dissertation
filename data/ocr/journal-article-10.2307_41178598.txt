<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTH, THE ARCHETYPE OF ALL OTHER FABLE: A Review of Recent Literature1 William G. Doty Torn between claims of romantic spookiness and rationalist- nonreferential banality, the modern scholarly discussion of the meaning and nature of myth has itself taken on mythic proportions. Girardot 1983, 7 In the past few years, books about myth have made a faster- than-light evolution. K. Thompson 1989, 102 Introduction Initiating a Myth and Ritual class a number of years ago, I naively assumed that a compilation of definitions of myth would lead us toward the desired academic clarity. No such luck! Some forty-five conflicting definitions later, I realized that "myth," like "culture," is a root metaphor, a hiving-con- cept that pulls after it not only polyphonies of stipulation but also hybridizations of meaning that make hellenistic syncre- tisms look like po'boys among the heathen. To be sure, I at- tempted multimorphic definitions, collocations, and analyses,2 yet the more definitions I amassed- easily three times as many now - the more I recognized that here was encysted no singular essence but rather the truly fabulous facticity and plurality of William G.

Doly necessary meanings, although each interpreter seeks the rea- gent that will reduce all to one or another archetypal essence. Psyche: myths project individual family problems; logos: myth seeks to explain and ratiocinate; poesis: myth catches fictional left-overs between emotional and rationalistic appropriations of the meanings of the universe (see Doty 1990a, which in an earlier version was entitled "The Sacred and Fictive Mythic- ky"). От etiology: myths simply en-narrate the protos heure tes, the first-finder beloved by the Greeks, but no small aspect of the Freudian or Eliadean priority of Beginnings, either! Or ritualis- tic-detritus, for those who give priority to pragmatism and praxis, the doing rather than the signifying. And of course there were and are other ways in and through myth. Myth remains the litmus paper test, the last-resort of the theological disputa- tion or the ideological defense, an easy exit that warrants the pejorative judgment, "It's only a myth." And yet: well, and yet authors still publish their attempts to establish the mythic interpretaría, the magical caduceus gifting the interpretive benchmark against which any subsequent golden bough must be judged. Here I will discuss only a few of many recent works, adjudicating and side-referencing items of merit that take on a portion of the field but do not establish global or totalizing perspectives the way most of those dis- cussed here do. The great range of the contemporary materials and the extent of the relevant bibliography (see for a sample the hundreds of footnotes and bibliographic references in Ed- munds 1990) are such that I can sometimes only refer to exten- sive discussions elsewhere. Mostly I give a flavor of the works cited, as a means of surveying some of the astonishingly wide- spread contemporary interest in myth; when I can, I show links to previous interpretation. Definitional and territorial-interpretative issues remain of great concern, and I treat them in a manner that reflects re- peated emphases and questions. The polyphony and polysemy of myth (I). Is myth necessarily narrative? (II). What is the rela- tion of myth to "history" (III) and to "truth" (IV)? I make ref- erence especially to the Greeks, because their status as originary for the Western tradition lends them special author- ity, and the question about their (and particularly Plato's) un-</page><page sequence="3">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 245 derstanding of myth has been approached from new perspectives recently.3 The semiotic and moral issues (how one applies myth, and how we understand its application in a non-native context) sur- face every time I lecture on myth and related subjects: How do we determine a "good" myth? Can a non-believer compre- hend another's myths fairly? Should parents regulate the mythic images taken in from the culture by their children? To what extent should mythography be engaged in identifying the contemporary worldview and anticipating the future (as rele- vant to marketing as to higher education)? In sections V-VII here I treat the ways such valuative and ideological issues influ- ence our perception of other cultures, and of our own, and in the final section I list additional topics that a more extensive treatment might engage. I. Definitions: Recognizing Polysemy Perhaps because of my initial assumption about definitions, or a fascination with typologies generally, Tve continued to track proposals for defining myths - not a difficult task, since, as Wendy Doniger [O'Flaherty] observes, the process of defini- tion is "a growth industry" (1988, 172)4; she also observes that "it is impossible to define myth, but it is cowardly not to try" (25). At the other end of the spectrum, Lowell Edmunds inter- prets Marcel Détienne as announcing that myth does not exist except as an intellectual construction developed by modern mythographers (Edmunds 1990, I).5 I am more receptive to Detienne's own observation that there was no Greek mythology in the sense of "a closely interwoven, homogeneous system of myths" in antiquity (1986, 47), but that to seek such a system not in global terms of "the Greeks" but of "a particular Greek community" ought not be ruled out of court (cf. Adkins 1991, 96). To get away from the problem - since the real systematizing of Greek myth was mostly brought about by the Hellenistic mytholographers and mythographers, both Greek and Latin - Edmunds attempts to look away from the semantic domain, that is, what people said about their myths, and toward the re- ported praxis; and in this case, of course, there were many myths, more or less co-ordinatedly organized. "More or less,"</page><page sequence="4">246 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty because classical scholarship today stresses variants or mul- tiforms rather than "original versions." The Greeks, observes Robert Eisner, knew tellings of a myth, but not the myth in an absolute, normative way (1987, 9). Indeed "each retelling or application produces a new variant, which stands in some de- gree of antagonistic relation to other variants or other myths" (Edmunds 1990, 15), simply because it is the creation of the teller, a localization or personalization of a mythic unit. Certainly the definitional span can be pulled too broadly, as when Harvey Birenbaum suggests that "myth is any version of reality" (1988, 183), but I rather like Lauri Honko's reminder that: "myth can cover an extremely wide field. Without resort- ing to an enumeration of the different ways in which the term is used nowadays, it is clear that myth can encompass everything from a simple-minded, fictitious, even mendacious impression to an absolutely true and sacred account" (1984, 41). Partly I'm attracted to Honko's statement because it seems to me to make explicit what has now become evident with respect to the polysemous nature of myth already in Greek antiquity. Plato's specification and differentiation between mythos and logos, although given practically revealed status by those who argue against myth as a primitive form of thinking, andyõr science as the only rational choice, is not a distinction deeply rooted in Greek antiquity. The Greeks always had a multiplicity of con- flicting versions, a situation that could be bothersome in rhe- torical argumentation (Edmunds 1990, 6). When "myth criticism" enters the later European picture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there is an attempt to reduce the mul- tiplicity, but now we can recognize that precisely as our attempt to control the originally-polyphonic Greek materials.6 Robert Mondi suggests that it does not "even seem reason- able to suppose the existence of a single hypothetical proto- myth, from which our attested versions have descended" (1990, 156). Similarly within iconography, notes Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood, no iconographie sign had a fixed meaning but remains polysémie (1990, 396), and we should be careful not to subject Greek culture to the valuative frameworks of our own period. For the Greeks, for instance, the emblematic or representative was as important as the discretely-historical is today (436). Contemporary iconographie analysis will have to</page><page sequence="5">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 247 be alert to the Derridean "trace": watching in particular for what might have been represented but was not, that which is discernible by heeding the syntactic relationships of semanti- cally-related elements in the open polysemy of the semiotics.7 We ought to situate ourselves no longer in the scopic and re- ductive position of the myth-summarizer typologizing the materials, but within the on-going myth-ing by which we con- tinue to make partial sense of this and then that experience. After all, notes Paul Veyne (1988, 1), the Greeks continued to try to make sense of their mythology for over 2000 years - let us not for our part refuse to enter into the spirit of the myths themselves, taking them beyond the Narcissistic sedimentation in The Same in order to re-sight the edge-questions that won't reduce to a mirroring of what we already know. The Greeks more frequently made distinctions other than that between myth and science: on the basis of traditionality (the process of historical selection that designates certain materials as too important to be forgotten), epichoricity (negatively: the limited-local, as opposed to the national); truth, a criterion that has somewhat different contours today since for the Greeks the truly-poetic was true; and histaridty (likewise a concept that was understood differently in Greek historiography than it is today; see Veyne 1988, 75 on the use of chronologies as exertions of hegemony in early Greek historiography). Many negative ref- erences to "mythos" stem from the Greek tendency still evi- dent elsewhere 2500 years later, namely the usage that identifies your version as a mythos, but mine as the truth (Ed- munds 1990, 14; Brillante 1990, 95 also notes a negative Greek attitude toward the multiple and sometimes divergent versions in which the "same" story was handed down). Stephen Daniel's thorough reconsideration of myth in phi- losophy from the time of Francis Bacon into Romanticism (1990) has quite revised the rather negative attitudes we have assumed characterized Western philosophy, and Frank E. Reynolds and David Tracey (1990) have edited papers from a University of Chicago Divinity School project organized explic- itly to challenge the traditional opposition between myth and logos, within the interdisciplines of the philosophy of religion and comparative religion.</page><page sequence="6">248 SOUNDINGS WilUam G Doty II. Narrativity and the Universalizing Story The affirmation that myth must above all mean narrative must certainly be one of the chestnuts overly-steamed in the mythog- rapher's alembic.8 The issue gets tense around the elements into which myths might be de-constituted: archetypes, mythic ideas, constituent conceptual foci, bundles of relations, mythemes .... Again Edmund's careful editorial comments are useful: "We customarily categorize myth as a species of narrative because alien mythic thought is normally accessible to us only when it is actualized as narrative. In its own cultural setting, however - that is, in the minds of those for whom it represents a real world view - a mythological system might bet- ter be seen not as a collection of discrete narrations but as a structured array of conceptual foci (god names, for instance) around each of which cluster various ideas, images, and narra- tive motifs" (1990, 145; see Bremmer 1987 on just one such clustering). The matter is complicated, not simplified, by re- course to studies of ancient Greece: different literary types were referred to there as "myth," and they included non-narra- tive genres; nor were myths considered poetic as opposed to non-poetic prose. If James Jakob Liszka is to have more impact upon this essay than contributing its title, I ought here to develop something of his claim that "myth is the most elementary form of narrative. It serves as the evolutionary ancestor for all others" (1989, 99); and further, "myth is essentially human action encoded as nar- ration" (117). Liszka shows how tragic and romantic-comic narratives intensify the consequences of the major narrative plots known to us since Aristotle's Poetics (16), and he rejects the usual narratological distinction between story or fabula and plot or sjuzet, because it "suggests an artificial distinction be- tween formless content and contentless form" (223, n.20). Liszka's semiotic position is close to that of Mieke Bal (1987) and Eisner, but it also helps to understand Pierre- Yves Jacopin's criticism of Lévi-Straussian structuralist analysis: treating myth formally as a self-contained metalanguage has helped us to understand the mythic process, and the continuity of mythemic units across contiguous cultures. But in focusing upon the paradigmatic mythical lexicon it has omitted analysis of the syntagmatic level; locating what seems to be the subject</page><page sequence="7">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 249 matter, the analyst can discard the mythic narrative itself, and yet the actual ethnographic context is embedded precisely in that narrative. Jacopin treats myth as formal speech, that is to say speech as a social performance-event that has both its own syntax for myth- ical speech and specific functions within the host society (1988, 133). He seeks to avoid both the structuralist problem of ig- noring the social setting, and the Marxian discussion of social influences apart from the texts of the myths themselves (155, n.5), by stressing that "the form of mythical speech in itself al- ready carries information" (141). To be sure, the emphasis upon the formal qualities remains extremely important if we are to avoid the sort of empiricist exegesis that gets misled by the outsider's own culture-specific intuitive understanding, and if we are to understand the performative aspects according to which myths, in contrast to other types of speech, actually change the reality of the mythteller and the audience: "Re- telling myths legitimizes the system of their beliefs, reinvigo- rates their worldview, and above all, confirms their identity and integrates them into their group" (156, n.9). Myths structure and trigger specific relationships, they carry knowledge, and differentiate between insiders and outsiders - functions crucial to the formation of personal identity (148), functions by which the social order comes to inhabit the individual psyche. Beyond what is immediately obvious in the themes or charac- ters of a myth, there is what Jacopin calls the deictic function, namely references to the underlying social realities that do not need to be named, but are part of the preunderstood worldview of the audience and teller (142). Differences be- tween various literary genres of a society lie more in differences in deictic reference than in formal marks of the myth, legend, or law (154); the deictic represents the ways "people use ob- jects, language, or institutions in general," and it will not be unrelated to the syntagmatic ordering of mythic narration, which will be not only chronological but logical: "myth is a continuation of sequences in which any sequence is the conse- quence of the one that precedes, and the cause of the one that follows . . . [T]he continuous relation of order between epi- sodes is a necessary feature of any definition of myth" (151). Jacopin forces myth studies to inquire why particular versions</page><page sequence="8">250 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty matter so much to their tellers, even when they seem to repre- sent natively counter-intuitive stories; why summarizing hand- books are to be distrusted; and why it is that a basic change in socio-historical context demands complete revision of the cul- ture's reference-myths if they are to remain fully viable.9 In one of those fundamentally-important deconstructive con- tributions that she seems to produce yearly, Mieke Bal (1987) revamps the whole tradition of universalizing "story" or "myth" that has determined Western literary agendas concern- ing myth. Bal suggests that referring to a universal message is merely a means of projecting an absolute foundation "back there" somewhere to buttress one's authority. Indeed myth is primarily important as a projective screen, hence not as some- thing transcendental or archetypal, but as the site for transfer- ence of personal materials, and she shows how both Sigmund Freud and Thomas Mann overlayered earlier versions of myths with the interpretation they sought to develop, quite in con- trast to the actual lineaments of those earlier versions. Subsequently Robert Eisner has noted Freud's typically- Vic- torian imposition of his own meaning upon Oidipous (Latin- ized: Oedipus): Freud is first of all wrong in referring to the Oidipous myth (1987, 10); and second he never utilizes it ex- actly in Greek terms, since "if Oedipus had had an Oedipus complex he would have killed Polybus and married Merope, the only parents he ever knew" (11). Essentially Freud's self- knowledge about his own Oedipus complex became universal Freudian dogma (20), a process of essen tializing from his own material that was typical likewise for Freud's approach to the dream: "the dream itself really doesn't count, but rather the memory and account of the dream," that is, the interpretation replaces the dream (24). For Eisner, Freud's myth-interpretation was always allegoresis: the language of the text is always sym- bolic of something else (the latent meaning), and myth is at most a social fantasy of reflected impulses (37). Bal's view of "story" goes against the grain of the universal- izing by which myth becomes a safety-belt in the flight from individual and specific elements of history; claiming a mythic rationale is a way of moving from a logical or historically- bounded claim to affirmation of a non-falsifiable originary that is not up for discussion.10 And even much myth-criticism, in-</page><page sequence="9">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 251 eluding that of structuralism with its emphasis upon the tran- scending meaning of any particular myths, has considered that "a myth is a myth because, under the layers of dust of histori- cally changing signifiers, it remains the same signifier-in- dependent signified, a universal story" (59, my emphasis). Recent narratology helps by its thick analysis, which (a) focuses upon the psychoanalytic frame of reference, (b) regards dis- course and plot as equal, (c) works with a dynamic rather than a static view of narrative, and (d) reintroduces historical aware- ness into the narratorial scene (60). I suggested that Jacopin's emphasis upon syntagm is likewise helpful: from either direc- tion we now have help in controlling the assumption that "the expression matters only as a symptom of its content and varia- tion matters only as evidence of similarity" (Bal 1987, 59), and interpretation (as we will see Liszka proposing in a later part of this essay) is regarded primarily as the place where the transfer- ence enters. III. Myths and Historicauty Re-writing a myth (one of the ways myth-criticism regards lit- erary versions) may be no more than a compulsory transfer- ence (Bal 1987, 68) by which a writer substitutes personal issues for those of the myth - as a means of rejecting the spe- cific myth, or at any rate the assumption that there is a stable framework somewhere back there that can be reawakened and revitalized. But that means of course that one deflects the im- portant issues into a never-never world of origins, escapes the bounds of time, and avoids the messy business of the shifting signifier of the subject of/in a myth. Writers and critics may avoid the mess by differentiating a "pseudo-transhistorical con- tent," the spirit, and "myth as discourse," the letter (61); but the dynamics of the mythic narrative continuity is best under- stood if the mythical unit is not understood as a unit of mean- ing but as a unifying structure for interpretations (versions) that are historically specific and discursive in particular ways (79). The summary of the mythic contents is not "the myth," but it "becomes an empty signifier which triggers other signifi- ers" (80). Hence "a mythical unit is not a unit of meaning but a signifying structure" (79-80), and "it is the action imposed onto the myth that is the myth" (80). The myth-critic no less</page><page sequence="10">252 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty than the myth-teller should be aware of the propensities for signifying transferences to appear guised as "interpretations," es- pecially in an era dominated unself-consciously by a belief that ours is a mythless time beyond the sway of any sort of myth. Richard Harvey Brown pursues just such a point in terms of noting how a scientistic view of the world can take on universal- izing contours (and we have learned from feminist critiques that we can substitute here "patriarchal contours"): Strictly speaking, Popper's literalist use of language is mythic, in that myth is language that has forgotten its roots in a sociohistorical com- munity. Myth presumes that the given meaning is the only possible one, and that the meaning is final, so it blinds itself to the halo of virtualities in which other possible meanings are floating. Myth makes scientific theories into speaking corpses .... Rhetorical analysis shows us the difference between myth and metaphor and reveals how myth gives a natural justification to historical intentions, thereby making contingent choice appear as eternal necessity. (Brown 1987, 17, my italics)11 The traditional question about the historicity of mythic refer- ence begins to take on different contours: Jacopin explicates the manner in which the primal history/myth can be revised (awkwardly and unsuccessfully in the case he cites) in order to deal with ongoing developments. Carlo Brillante shows, as Ed- mund puts it, that for the Greeks "the hero myths were what we would call history" (Edmunds 1990, 91); the Greeks did not distinguish as we do between myth and history, i.e., history in/ of Greek myth. Critical reflection began in the sixth century ВСЕ, but it didn't cut very deeply into the important meanings of the hero myths (the situation with respect to cosmogonie myths was somewhat different: there anthropomorphic deities tended to be replaced by physical elements and abstract princi- ples). The ancient historian had quite different criteria of suc- cess, not the least of which was expressing the moral significance of national status.12 Nor was what we call "citing of sources" known in antiquity. According to the conventions of Hellenistic historiography, for instance, it was common to represent as verbatim speeches what the author thought might have been the words spoken by a general to his confederates, speeches the historian could in no way have witnessed.13 Historical veracity was, in Veyne's words, "a vulgate authenticated by consensus over the ages.</page><page sequence="11">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 253 This consensus sanctioned the truth as it sanctioned the repu- tation of those writers held to be classical" (1989, 6). Thus in a manner quite alien to our own models of historical veracity, the historian and the reader of histories simply assumed that ear- lier historical accounts (many that we have come to call "leg- ends") were authentic: it was assumed that the historian must have been trustworthy or the work would not have been trans- mitted. Instead of "did it really happen?" one looked to the reliability of the historian, who was praised when successful in conveying the historico-moral purpose, rather than the detailed data of the acta or historical chronicle. IV. The Truth/s of Myth/s Obviously we are not dealing with a culture that distin- guished as sharply as we do between the "poetic" and the "his- torical": what did have to be clarified was the basis for hermeneutical interpretation of what was assumed to be "truth," no matter what genre (cf. Brillante 1990, 94). But that's also a feature of our own interpretive situation: Liszka notes that religious hermeneutics now argue less for "the True Meaning in the text" than for something like "Meaningful within particular shared communities" (11) as emphasized, for instance in literary criticism, by Stanley Fish. Jacques Waar- denburg insists that instead of speaking of the absolute reality of symbols and myths, we can speak at most only of their use by people for whom they are real (1980, 41). Such a point leaves us open to Leszek Kolakowski's notation that "in the scientific sense, 'true' means that which has the chance of being em- ployed in effective technological procedures" (1989, 1), that is, technologies that determine the dominating "truths" today. Likewise Doniger [O'Flaherty] suggests that myths do not have meanings but provide contexts in which meaning occurs: "a myth is not so much a true story as a story on which truth is based, a story which people may infuse with their truth" (1988, 35). Veyne stresses the contextual nature of truthfulness: "truth is the name we give to the choices to which we cling" (1988, 127); "many of the ways of believing, or, to put it more accu- rately, many are the registers of truth of a single object" (136, n.33). Furthermore, "truth is plural and analogical" (87, cf.</page><page sequence="12">254 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty 113 on the plurality of criteria of truth); "truth is a homonym that should be used only in the plural. It is not a transhistorical invariant but a work of the constitutive imagination" which re- fers "to the fact that each epoch thinks and acts within arbitrary and inert frameworks" (117-18). Hence there is actually some- thing "inert" or passive about truth; so far as myth is con- cerned, it is always something passed on from someone else, and so "far from being the most simple realistic experience, truth is the most historical" (xi). It is the way the imagination has been historically shaped; that which sets the imagination working toward new multiforme and encompassings: "truths are already products of the imagination and . . . .the imagina- tion has always governed. It is the imagination that rules, not reality, reason, or the ongoing work of the negative" (xii).14 But it is precisely such perspectives that are being challenged today by the reactive works of a George Steiner (1989) or Paul Falck; somehow the widely accepted deconstructionist position that "there is nothing outside the text" represents for Falck a position that "in effect abolishes reality" and he will argue the necessity of restoring "the concepts of truth or of vision to our discussions of literature" (1989, xii). One wonders sometimes how critics can so persistently ignore discussions of precisely such issues across the field of deconstructive or postmodernist thought, although of course the terminology of previous gener- ations no longer shapes the discussion. There can be funda- mentalisms of intellectual comprehension no less than of religious adherence to the dogmas of the past! From a quite different position Norman Austin engages the subject-object dichotomy lurking in such reactions, noting that "the flaw in the empirical argument is that we live not in a world of facts but in a field of signifìers. A fact, in and of itself, has no signifi- cance"; "true philosophy leads us away from objects and facts into the domain of significance, and here the real problem be- gins" (1990, 12). Following just such a train of thought, Veyne argues that "myth is a sort of tertium quid, neither true nor false" (28), de- pendent upon application or appropriation by a particular indi- vidual or tradition. Indeed when myth becomes political ideology or rhetorical "truth," with its own air of unreality and hyper-conventionality, it will demand "a special modality of be-</page><page sequence="13">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 255 lief" (79), and we are on the way to the decline of prestige of the orator's arts. The Greek respect for the traditional was enormous; but it was also very pragmatic and centered on the best interest of the moment: "the Greeks believe and do not believe in their myths. They believe in them, but they use them and cease believing at the point where their interest in believ- ing ends" (84). "Greek myths were never told without a mo- tive, which was often competitive" (Edmunds 1990,14). I5 V. Cultural Mythoi and Ontic Archetypes Certainly the Greek interest in myths also took a more theo- sophical tone as well, and Austin's emphasis upon ontology is echoed in the works of Harvey Birenbaum (myth is a measure of ontology itself, 1988, 149) and N. J. Girardot ("myth is the traditional storied use of language for purposes of finding and making sense of the world," 1983, 8). Austin suggests that the "semaphore flags" created by myth function "to guide the soul's ascent from physics to metaphysics" (194); nonetheless the same author observes how often the numinous that is ex- perienced initially as being-itself is replaced eventually by a cul- ture's elaborated and secondary systems of signification (21). Many analysts agree that one extremely important aspect of myth is to relate the microcosm to the macrocosm. For exam- ple, Birenbaum notes that "a myth ... is a symbol in the form of a story, expressing (or producing) a confrontation between the limited perspective of the self and the unlimited context in which it exists" (113, there in italics). It is, to use a heavily over-flexed word, an archetype, or we may say it carries arche- types, or works archetypally. But before we are betrayed into the controversy about ex- actly what a (presumably-Jungian) archetype might be, let me suggest that the way we approach the recurrence of mythic ex- periences has been clarified enormously by Estella Lauter's demystifying perspective. Lauter recognizes archetypal shap- ings in the work of hundreds of female artists: These women have not discovered truths that are outside his- tory; they have simply responded to the imperatives of their own history in ways that may disclose the imperatives of ours. (1984,x)</page><page sequence="14">256 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty When we uncover a myth or an archetype, we do not necessar- ily reveal a "given" of human nature, (x) I do not see the archetype as an unchanging entity outside the process of human development. Instead, I believe it is a tendency to form an image in response to recurrent experiences, (xi, my emphasis; Austin 1990 likens archetypes to DNA) Archetypes ought to be approached first and primarily not as transcendental psychic images spanning back into the Jungian objective psyche (earlier "the collective unconscious")» but as "experiential parameters in a network of relationships that has both the stability and the unpredictability of human history" (xi); they represent "persistent problems of human experi- ence" (208). "The value of the archetypal or mythic image is that it leads us back to experiential nodes that have been im- portant for long enough or to enough people to call for re- sponse" (xi). Lauter's task (partly shared, among authors discussed here, byjewett and Lawrence 1988 and Rue 1989) is that of descry- ing the contemporary mythos, which she undertakes by means of analysis of some of the contemporary mythoi represented in the large corpus of women's texts - artworks - she has studied directly or in photographs. While it is difficult to sight just how a mythos, and hence an ethos and a worldview are shaping themselves, the contemporary love of statistics for once pro- vides some help: Lauter can observe that a large percentage of her sample verbalized, enacted, or visualized particular themes. Over 200 of the more than 1000 artists studied "were clearly concerned with a network of related images concerning the transformation from one form into another. In my interpreta- tion, these images of transformation amount to a re-evaluation of nature- our own and the world's" (18). Other important themes identified included the importance of the image of the Earth as Sister (19) and a new sort of Quest motif, driven not by what are often coded as masculine emphases upon individ- ual genius, egotistical motivation, and personal achievement, but by achieving harmony with powerful nonhuman forces (16). Many of the artists were unaware of participating in a myth- shaping process, yet Lauter thinks that the changes she sights are coming into view from deep within the cultural psyche (169), understanding psyche not as some atemporal transcen-</page><page sequence="15">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 257 dence, but as a spiritual awareness evoked from and shared within the historical experience of our own day. Such a per- spective enables Lauter to project a prospective view, a for- ward-looking analysis of some of the "trouble spots" in western mythology: the emphasis on the masculine in our images of God; the con- finement of the mother to the realm of intimate relationships; the emphasis on the seductress in every woman; the definition of creativity in terms of a heroic (masculine) quest; the identifica- tion of woman with nature to the detriment of both; the assump- tion that woman is the guardian of love; the hierarchical arrangement of the species, as if the ladder were the most "natu- ral" principle of relationship; and the dichotomizing tendencies of our language and thought, as if it were really true that "with- out contraries there is no progression," or as if "progression" were the only viable option in our lives. (204) The analytic here, whether positively applied in terms of identi- fying new archetypcal motifs, or negatively in naming problem- atic aspects of old motifs, discloses the semiotic frames by which we constitute our mythic perspectives in quotidian oper- ation. We see into the cultural process of shaping the interpre- tive units and perspectives that will make sense as we re-utilize what comes from the past and what lies ahead. In reflecting upon the parallels between women's imagery today and the sort of pre- or proto-historical imagery we have only recently been able to identify clearly (and now we can add the marvel- ously produced and documented Gimbutas 1989), Lauter her- self recognizes that the retrieve is not merely a limited play of images, but: "we are repeating an experience of collectivity that underlies the formation of the culture's symbolic code. We are repeating the imaginative state that produced myth in the first place" (208). Such an approach helps us remember the historically-situ- ated nature of semiotic systems, but it is also a response to the critique made by Doniger and others who feel uncomfortable at the extent of focus upon Goddess religions and the attempt to re-create a contemporary equivalent. What Doniger distrusts is the attempt to develop a myth-on-demand, "to create a myth on purpose for other people to use" (Doniger [O'Flaherty] 1988, 173, n.29), and that is a very different enterprise from what we have reported in Lauter's work, which is attempting to identify</page><page sequence="16">258 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty a particular area of cultural semiotics as it emerges, an area that is evincing new, more feminine, ways of interpreting and shap- ing human cultures. A similar claim is made for William Anderson's Green Man (1990), but for revoicing a masculine ecological archetype. But the book never engages contemporary cultural psychology in any useful manner. On the other hand, Daniel Noel's Approach- ing Earth (1986) successfully identifies an aspect of the cultural- mythos, namely the reconsideration of our planet made neces- sary by the Space Age, in which awareness of the vast contin- uum of infinite time and space now relativizes our usual planetary self-conceptions. Noel probes a range of figures and images - the Goddess movement, Norman Mailer, René Magritte, megaliths, aerial archaeology, and earth art, seeking the sort of healthy "geometaphors" that may enable us to cher- ish and care for Earth more effectively and specifically - in con- trast to Joseph Campbell's frequently-repeated but generalizing pieties about the need for a new global mythology of oneness among people. VI. Myths in the Culture and Our Amythic Condition American mythology, notes Doniger, is certainly surviving, but it is not performing many of the functions of traditional mythology, that is, shaping our lives with their meanings (Doniger [O'Flaherty] 1988, 135). To be sure, film and drama do sometimes today take the place of communal ritual (122), but postmodern mythic figures and images certainly seem to be surfacing in less explicit fashion than those sighted in the im- portant book by Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence, The American Monomyth (1977, reissued in 1988). Joseph Campbell easily sighted simple heroic patterns in George Lucas' science fiction films, but the mapping of the postmodern anti-hero in the film Blue Velvet, even given all its "archetypal" exploration of the banality of evil and the nature of "pure love," is complex in the extreme, and Ross (1990) and Castiglia (1990) open our eyes to homophobic heroics in Bonanza, Tin Men, Rebel Without a Cause, Consenting Adults, and other films. Nor can one easily place within the range of the traditional heroic archetypes the hero of Carlos Fuentes' Christopher Unborn, who grumbles re-</page><page sequence="17">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 259 peatedly and angrily at his father for having thrown him out of his testicles just for a fleeting moment of pleasure! Have all the master narratives been relinquished, then, as Jean-François Lyotard and a raft of other postmodernists claim? Certainly Loyal Rue considers that some central master narratives have broken down entirely in the face of contempo- rary science: "It is about time (and has been for generations) that we put aside the notion that supernatural realities of any kind are operative in human life. In fact, it is about time we began to realize that such notions are potentially threatening to our continued survival (1989, 16). Rue thinks that in particular the supernaturalist definition of the Deity as Person has suc- cumbed and now creates only alienation or, in the fundamen- talist reactionary movements, a privatization where "the Holy Spirit speaks to the individual who has bracketed the evening news together with everything learned in school and who man- ages to crawl into a private sanctuary of meditation where the concerns are likely to be immediate and selfish" (98). Of course cosmology and morality are disjunct in such a situation; of course we can only speak, a$ does Rue, of amythia- of the shattering of the important root metaphors that formerly helped individuals to orient their lives. But if in our time "values . . . become part of a range of op- tions for orienting one's life" (100), then the individual must search anywhere and everywhere for personally rewarding sys- tems, and we have the repeated observation of "nihilism, alien- ation, anomie, loss of identity, and existential crisis" that Rue would counter with a return to the Judaeo-Christian concept of the Covenant, a concept that has been reformulated periodi- cally to reflect the historical experiences of the Jewish and Christian religious communities. Such a concept promises at- tention to the collective nature of human existence, precisely what recent popular religiosity has omitted in favor of individ- ual subjectivity; for Rue, the transition point is found in a philosophical-naturalistic understanding of evolution as "in- tranatural transcendence" (171): "evolutionary theory gives us a vision of what is true about the world (cosmology), and it gives us some ideas about how to behave in the world (moral- ity). In this way it presents itself as an adequate root metaphor for myth" (177). Rue urges the parishioner to return to the</page><page sequence="18">260 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty church on the corner, not as a perfect place, but as a base for operations in which ultimately: "the Covenant will be trans- posed from conventions which include the metaphor of God as person and a scheme of salvation which is dualistic and individ- ual to conventions whereby God is not a person and salvation is achieved in the context of natural systems and social relations" (170). Hence Rue's revisionist Christian theology would speak of the Deity's way of working in the world as that of evolution, and would find in Jesus Christ a model of "the process by which we come to exist as human beings": "Nor is the ultimacy of the Christological claim lost under this interpretation, for the principle of self-sacrifice, revealed in the Christ figure, is not something without which human beings can possibly live; its recognition and realization are central to our salvation. To be a Christian is to confess, 'It is in the Christ figure that I have come to see self-sacrificial behavior as non-optional' (188). I have emphasized Rue's conclusions rather than the steps by which he builds his argument; it should be obvious that such a position as the polysemy of Greece explored earlier in this es- say would be anathema to such a thinker, and in fact Rome's individualizing pluralism represents for Rue precisely a major reason for its downfall (55-56). VII. Semiotic Control of Myths What we are seeing in these materials and approaches is the contemporary view that myth is constitutive of culture, that it both reflects and influences social practice: hence it is often impervious to rational arguments, and it is likely to appear as conservative, maintaining a status quo rather than provoking innovation. Myth in this sense is the means by which the cul- ture selects its units of meanings (mêmes , Rue 1989, 56) and for that reason control of mythemes or meme-selection funds the dominance of any power that can suppress or broadcast semi- otic principles and choices, whether it be the communications media, government, or even the educational establishment that determines what will be heard, studied, or taught. In his helpful book on the career and writing of Ernst Cas- sirer, John Michael Krois lays out some of the background be- hind Cassirer's dismay at the role the National Socialists played in spreading Nazi dominance by means of controlling German</page><page sequence="19">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 261 public myths. As the selection of myths was controlled, and their dominance carefully reinforced (around, for instance, such issues as the "fate" of the German culture, Krois 1987, 192), the Nazis were the first to practice the twentieth-century's new technique of manufacturing myth, a pragmatic technique used to block the development of the self-responsible personal- ity (189). Reading Cassirer from a post-war prison cell, Albert Speer said that Cassirer had understood precisely the Nazis' plan to eradicate the self-responsible personality as part of a revisioning of all morality.16 I have been delighted lately to see the development of a tra- dition of critical semiotics that heeds the consequences of mytheme-system choices and advocates the study of semiotic systems for the express purpose of recognizing their possible misapplication. Dean and Juliet MacCannell and Jack Solo- mon, treating the functions of semiotics in our culture, speak clearly about the morality of semiotic analyses: The MacCan- nells show in their initial chapter the moral basis by which sign systems such as nature-vs.-culture are constructed, and they conclude that "one role of semiotics is to keep reflections [on linguistic structures] honest and open" (1982, 16). For his part, Solomon emphasizes the use of semiotics to free oneself from the control of cultural signs by learning to recognize how they have been produced in history and culture (1988, 8, 57, 236). And Marshall Blonsky's editing of his reader on semio- tics (1985) highlights the use of semiotics by the culture, partic- ularly in news reporting and advertising. Thomas Sebeok's essay (1985) in that reader, on the use of semiotics to design a multi-generational warning sign for atomic waste, should give anyone pause who has not considered the direct relevance of myth and ritual in shaping social actions. A more sustained argument has been developed by Liszka, who argues that myths are actually "dangerous symbols," in that they highlight cultural oppositions; simply by reiterating cultural values and rules, they release their oppositional poten- tials. The cultural control comes in at the point of interpreta- tions according to which particular dogmatic postures are replicated and enforced. A critical semiotic "substitutes under- standing and explanation for dogma, and . . . interpretation is delimited or directed" (1990, 16); hence "to subject myth to</page><page sequence="20">262 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty criticism, to lay bare the symbolics of its process, is to engage in the most comprehensive criticism of a culture." Shared interpretation, suggests Liszka, is legitimate, whereas forced or arbitrary interpretation creates the ideology that rein- forces hierarchies and stabilizes the possibly-unbalancing effect of the myths themselves (162-63). The commitment to consen- sus on the part of a critical semiotic would provide for reasoned discourse and norms, and it heeds the transvaluative role of myths in sending one back to the main terms represented in the cultural materials: "in the end, true art, true myth, is moral, transvaluative, not because it tends to teach its audience a les- son, but because it should engender evaluation" (219). Myths themselves are not ideological but primarily transvaluative, in that they both hide and reveal possibilities: myths are the over- flow, the symbolic fallout of asymmetries incorporated when new values enter. What Liszka refers to as interpretation, on the other hand, is a value-shifter rather than a value-producer, and its function will shift according to the dynamics of the culture and the racon- teur (202). 17 Critical semiotics attempts to move beyond the deconstructive position at the interstices of thought to the lo- cus where consensus is decided: it would be fascinating to see whether Liszka would adjudge Rue's proposed return to a repristinized version of Judaeo-Christian Covenant theology as (a) representing "interpretation" in Liszka's negative sense, or as (b) an attempt to establish a community in which a consen- sus of interpretation might be legitimately established, a ques- tion that also faces the hermeneutics of Fish and other literary critics. VIII. Postmodernist Structuralism and Psychology My bookshelves now contain an entire section devoted to books on "post-modernism," but I am not aware of any at- tempt to suggest contours for a comprehensive post-structural- ist, postmodernist position for the understanding of myth. There are some components, however, that might be under- stood as postmodernist, and I will look at some of them here, while recognizing that in some quarters structuralism itself is considered to have been improved, so that one may speak of a revisionist structuralism as well as of /wwJ-structuralism.</page><page sequence="21">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 263 That we are in a secondary or post-structuralist period is per- haps nowhere so obvious as in Richard Caldwell's attempt (1990) to legitimate Freudian psychoanalytic criticism by incor- porating structuralist methodologies, and a frame of analysis that I cannot imagine anyone in the disciplines that formerly used structuralist analysis using today. There are other hold- outs, such as the essay by Brillante in the same volume as Cald- well's: "structural analysis still represents today the type of ap- proach most capable of doing justice to the wealth of particular renderings of stories, each of which reveals partial potentiali- ties inherent in the narrative" (1990, 120). No wonder Bril- lante finds Détienne so threatening! - "In his analysis the very notion of myth is placed in doubt and practically dispelled" (124); "this drastic negation .... What nevertheless appears impoverished in the wake of Detienne's analysis is one of the aspects that structural analysis has most emphasized in its ex- amination of myth: myth's capacity of representation, that is, its symbolic function" (124). But it ought to be clear at this point in this essay that the contemporary view of the "symbolic function" is a different kettle of semiotic fish than could be comprehended within structuralist networks. The fundamental critique of the positions of Claude Lévi- Strauss in 1966 by Jacques Derrida (1978) certainly left vast gaps in the structuralist analytic18; in what he explicitly calls a non-Lévi-Straussian analysis, Christopher Vecsey shows how a myth works for the Ojibway, providing all sorts of knowledge, and directly shaping the worldview (1988, ch. 3); what is strik- ing, of course, is that Vecsey terms his analysis non-Lévi- Straussian, yet still structural.19 We saw earlier Jacopin's ex- pansion of the structuralist analytic in the direction of incorpo- rating both the semantic and the syntactic levels. Psychological disciplines, formalized only in this century, now span a wide range. Generally strict Freudians despise Jun- gians, and pop-psychologists suspect anyone working from the more formal disciplines. Caldwell's attempt to "save" Freu- dian myth analysis by adding a structuralist component has been mentioned;20 otherwise a more subtle psychoanalytic fla- voring can be detected in almost any contemporary school of critical theory. Bal's essay is a good example, but it would be excluded by Caldwell, since "psychoanalytic interpretation</page><page sequence="22">264 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty should not be attempted (or criticized) without a thorough grounding in Freud's basic writings" (1990, 386, n.l). Like- wise the rich Jungian approach, because "Jungian psychology is not psychoanalysis." Why other Freudian approaches to mythic materials (such as the brilliant and extensive studies by Alan Dundes, or those earlier by Géza Róheim) are not even mentioned by Caldwell is never self-evident. Psychological approaches to mythology are of less impor- tance today than ever before, perhaps because academic psy- chology has moved away almost entirely from questions of cultural or personal meaning. (A sophomore who had just completed several courses in the field put it to me this way: "Those folks aren't interested in meaning or interpretation, are they? Every time I'd ask about significance, the instructors reply that there is no statistically-meaningful way to explore significance or values.") But certainly outside academic depart- ments, such issues continue to be central to myth studies heav- ily influenced by psychological models, such as Austin and Eisner, cited repeatedly in this essay. Both are professors of classics, and represent the nonestablishment position on many issues within psychoanalysis. Austin is much more favorable toward Jungian positions than is Eisner; both are influenced by contemporary French and German anthropology and classics, that rich brew encompassing Détienne, Jean-Pierre Vernant, Walter Burkert, René Girard, and others that I have not found space to review here. Likewise I can only gesture toward the trifunctionalist or "sociological" approach epitomized in Bon- nefoy (1991). Conclusion It will be obvious that I have not elected to discuss the works of Joseph Cambell, recently brought before the public eye, but essentially available to the scholarly world decades ago.21 Nor have I attempted to discuss particular mythic re-imaginings, such as Downing (1989) or the much less impressive Bolen (1989), or Morgan's (1990) explicit rejection of the hyper-mas- culinist western hero mythologem that was so well captured by Campbell's summary of earlier studies; Gill's (1987) analysis of the twentieth-century creation of an American-continent equivalent of Gaia shows that while Mother Earth is now im-</page><page sequence="23">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 265 portant in Native America and the ecology movement, it was not previous to the nineteenth century; and Napier's helpful (1986) charting of the phenomenon of masking, in a few south- eastern, as well as western cultures; and others I have men- tioned but not discussed. Other works appearing recently strike me as uselessly obfuscating and detrimental to the field (Lincoln 1989); insufficiently organized for academic consider- ation (Moehle 1987, Day 1984, Sharpe 1984, W. I. Thompson 1989); or repetitive of some of the traditional positions (but see Versnel 1990 for its marvelously rich bibliographic goldmine). Works treating myth in philosophy, such as Daniel 1990, mentioned above, ideology, and revisionings of mythic images such as the hero/heroine and myths of masculinity are engaged in others of my writing projects. I am particularly interested in the ways myths inform and surface in mass media, and refer here only to two issues of Communication Studies (Summer 1990, Summer 1991), which contain discussion especially of Robert C. Rowlands' essay, "On Mythic Criticism" (1990). I suppose one might argue that the recognition of myth's ar- chetypal status has seeded all subsequent literary expression, but it is more useful simply to recognize that it seeds many aca- demic debates as well. Here I have touched a few of these de- bates, but it is certain that they will continue and diversify. Liszka's "archetype of all other fable" gets expanded, then, to "and of critical study of those fables"; or as any self-respecting critical theorist today would quickly add, "which are themselves fables of the fictional imaginings by which our experience here is signified."22 I mean that "imagining" pretty much the way Scott Momaday puts it: "Having the facts at hand is less impor- tant, in my opinion, than is having the desire to satisfy one's curiosities through imagining. And we also need some great mystery in our origins. That is, I would not like to know every- thing about my heritage. I want to be absolutely free to imag- ine parts of it. The factors are not very important. The possibilities are everything" (Woodard 1989, 4).</page><page sequence="24">266 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty NOTES The dedication is to my colleagues in myth study: there is something there, all of us know that; and something there reaches to something here: the bridging is the delicate task that requires those stubbornly tensile strengths of imaginai hermeneutics. Most of those who have taught me so much are, to my great fortune, still around; sadly that is not true with respect to a loving and brilliant colleague, Stephen Karatheodoris, who died suddenly in April 1990 and left us au bereft. Here you find only a reflected glance from his piercing intellect that always refused to accept the status quo. 1. My title derives from Liszka, who deserves to be quoted in full: It may be argued with some foundation that myth is the archetype of all other fable: folk tale, epic, drama, parable, romance, novel. But myth is foundational not simply in terms of the influence of a tradi- tional content, in the manner in which the Greek drama was influ- enced by the Greek myths; rather, myth has a more hidden effect, importing to the genres that follow it a common form, a narrative heritage, as well as a series of teloi which tie them intimately to the cultures in which they are generated. It this be so, then the study of myth is a study in the fundaments of narration and the socioculturel function of the story. (1989, 1). A review essay on Liszka's impressive book might well unpack just this quotation. I use it here, however, essentially to begin reflection upon a number of issues surfacing in several of the Works Cited. In other essays in progress I am working on some of these themes. "Silent Myths Sing- ing in the Blood: The Sites of Production and Consumption of Myths in a 'Mythless' Society" treats some of the ways myths manifest even in a so- contemporary society as ours; another essay canvasses some of the ways the classical heroine/hero motifs need to be revisioned today. 2. See Doty (1986, ch. 2). Other writings listed here extend the scope of Mythography by reviewing recent mythographic studies: (1987) discusses recent German mythography; (n.d.a.) looks at revisionings of giants such as Frazer and Harrison; (1989) views some of the ways participant obser- vation has come to be redefined. 3. I have in mind Puhvel (1987), a dense collection of lecture notes, and Mondi (1990) and Nagy (1990), all of which are concerned with ques- tions of Indo-European context and derivation, rather than the other works confronting Greek myths such as Veyne (1988) or Détienne (1986), or the relevant sections of vol. 1 of Bonnefoy 1991. I recom- mend very highly Adkin's most useful account (1990) of Greek usage of terms that have come to dominate our hermeneutics, namely myth, logos, philosophy, praxis, gnosis, deity, priest, et al. In many cases Adkins points out (more by explicitation than correction) how importantly different was the entire Greek religious spectrum from what we have come to anticipate from subsequent Western developments: belief was nifty, but never as important as praxis; there were no national guilds of priests, who were primarily janitors of local shrines; only after Platon ought we to expect that different messages would be conveyed by mythos or logos. 4. To be sure Doniger (formerly Wendy Doniger OTlaherty) stipulates "a growth industry within the profession of the history of religions," and my scope is considerably broader, although I do not engage technicalia such as the earlier differentiations between myth, legend, hero story, etc.: see</page><page sequence="25">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 267 Bascom (1984) for some of the most careful distinctions of myth and other folk genres. Doniger's own definition ("rather cumbersome and . . . functional," she notes) is especially broad: A myth is a story that is sacred to and shared by a group of people who find their most important meanings in it; it is a story believed to have been composed in the past about an event in the past, or, more rarely, in the future, an event that continues to have meaning in the present because it is remembered; it is a story that is part of a larger group of stories. (Doniger [O'Flaherty] 1988, 27) 5. Note Calarne (1990, 278): "What we call myth . . . has no existence in itself, nor does it correspond to any universal cultural reality. In essence, myth is only a concept invented by modern anthropology out of uncer- tainties gradually recognized by the Greeks themselves as to the histori- cal reality of certain episodes in their tradition." Calarne notes that "Myth does not exist, except as a general notion of the mythic, which developed toward the end of the fifth century, along with the kind of politicomilitary, psychologizing history exemplified by Thucydides" (278-79). 6. When the mythos vs. logos schema dear to Wilhelm Nestle does get estab- lished, by the way, the very "scientists" who led the anti-myth movement were themselves believers in things we'd consider quite ridiculous: Thu- cydides, oracles; Aristotle, dream divination; Pausanias, dream direc- tions-see Veyne (1988, 74). 7. Note Firth (1990) on the lack of fixity in passing on myths, and van Baaren (1990) on the flexibility of myth. Sullivan argues that "the dissat- isfaction with any single mythic account describes an existential restless- ness with the singular and the unique" (1988, 57). Jakobsons critique of Lévi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) helps us see the selectivity and arbitrariness of myth - "it excludes and denies as much as it states" (1985, 185) - and demonstrates how a structuralist approach can scientif- ically guess at what missing information might have filled a particular se- mantic slot. 8. Another is that myths have to refer to the realm of divine beings, no longer, I suspect, taken very seriously by anyone, although Cassirer thought one might conceive of narratives about heroes and gods as hav- ing secondary status in the progression of Western thought (Krois 1987, 85). 9. Jacopin's book that promises to expand upon these concepts, Mytho-log- ics, announced for 1988, has not yet appeared. I would like to point back to the 1964 essay by Alan Dundes entitled "Texture, Text, and Context" (1980), a "thickening" essay that moved folkloristics away from formalist concerns with definitions to analysis of the full range of the materials, from the linguistic-syntactic to the contextual variations responsible for particular performance realizations. Jacopin's example ought to be read in its specific ethnograhic and contextual details. He shows how histori- cal changes reflected in the Yakuna myth that he studies are disclosed syntactically in the awkward joins and sequential relationships between parts of the myth. Implicitly, by the way, he demonstrates very clearly why modern scientific views of the universe simply cannot be added onto the Christian theological myths: they demand fundamental revision, which calls into question the stasis and status of the reference myths of Bereshith/Genesis. Much of the recent literature on masculinity wonders</page><page sequence="26">268 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty how it is that an anti-liberal heterosexualist emphasis upon the family has suddenly reasserted its clout under Reagan-Bush-Thatcher. The answer is that the post-Freudian, post-liberal climate represents a reassertion of the very patriarchial systems of power we seemed finally to be escaping. All the anti-gay sentiment, the pro-family, anti-abortion movement, and the restriction of sexual expression to the marriage bed stems from a strong sense that only restoring the old mythico-moralistic frames will enable us to survive. Of several analyses, Brittan 1989 and Segal 1990 are perhaps the most immediately prescient as the necessary critical re- covery begins. 10. See Volney Gay's extremely helpful approach (1989) to the longing of many in our culture for occult blessings to replace and supplement that approval which we never felt we received earlier in our lives. Gay's psy- chological argument has ramifications across the range of modern theory about transcendence and the absolute signifier. Note also Austin (1989, 24) and Bal (1987, 66): "This is exactly how mythical thinking functions. The basic message of myths ... is: what I think (phantasies, wishfully distorted) is the truth because it has always been so. The authority of age becomes the historical projection of the unwillingness to assume the his- toricality of the I's wishes." 11. Kolakowski likewise points out that "belief in Reason is a mythical op- tion; it therefore lies beyond the scope of reason; no myth falls under the dichotomy of truth and falsity" (1989, 41). Girardot (1983, 9) avoids sticking explicitly to narrative in terms of myths functioning "under- ground" as "mythic themes" in nonmythological literary forms (he refers to Mircea Eliade, Myth and Reality). Mythic theme represents "the detect- able presence in written texts of recurrent symbolic images, or particular paradigmatic clusters of related images, that both summarize a central mythological idea and condense in an ideal-typical way the basic struc- ture or logic of a set of myths, not all of which necessarily have the same historical or cultural background." Girardot has to deal with the fact that much of the material he deals with, e.g., Dao de fing, is non-narrative (mostly only "an unusually terse collection of semipoetic epigrams" 13 f.). Hence he can speak of early Chinese literature as being "structurally mythic if not mythological in terms of overt characters or narrative form" (14). 12. Toynbee's collection (1952) gives a number of examples of historio- graphie prefaces that make clear the primary importance of making "his- tories," namely to sing the lasting praises of a particular Hellenic or Hellenistic culture. Cf. McNeil (1986, ch. 2), "The Care and Repair of Public Myth," for startling parallels with the modern myth systems that drive moral evaluation of historical circumstances, and McNeil's careful recognition of the new day in historiography that is not afraid of what he calls my this tory, namely self-conscious recognition of the role of the values of the audience reading the historical reconstruction (19). Thank heav- ens! Since as Sullivan notes (1988, 884, n.550), the categories used to explain myths and their relation to historical occurrences may be more resistant to change than the myths themselves are! 13. Veyne (1988, 5) notes that when citation ot sources began to appear m 1560, Pasquier was reproached for interrupting his reconstruction with so many citations of sources! The actual habit of citing authorities and scholarly annotation came not from historians but theologians and ju- rists, who did not consider themselves historians: "scholarly annotation</page><page sequence="27">Myth, the Archetype of All Other Fable 269 has a litigious and polemical origin" which came about when universities gained the monopoly on intellectual activity, and writers began to write for their colleagues instead of general readers (11). 14. Histories of photography discuss the long debate, at the inception of the artform, about the representation of "reality" in photography, and espe- cially in photography as opposed to painting; but the issue is now dis- cussed again from the point of view of many of those whose photographs all along were self-consciously designed with blurred focus, either overall or in select portions: see the three essays in Weinbenr (1989). 15. Vecsey shows how completely political and didactic is the Hopi use of mythological traditions (1988, ch. 2). Eisner (1987) discusses the role of the myths about Philoctetes to demonstrate how Greek myths were used for entertainment, as a collection of personality types useful for under- standing others, to supply role models of the public service and heroic achievement expected of the leader, modeling the artful rhetorician, and reminding the individual of the necessity of conforming to societal rules and expectations. It is striking how many of these issues surface in Ed Cohen's recounting of his experiences (1990) as a gay scholar having to rewrite his scholarship for an MLA publication and to represent his scholarly work partially and inaccurately in order to gain academic em- ployment in the homophobic American intellectual academy. 16. That's so sadly ironic in light of the fact that Cassirer had been the first Jewish intellectual to be elected to the highest post within the German university system, Rektor at Hamburg, in 1929, but by 1933 he'd applied for permission to leave the country, and was relieved of his duties imme- diately thereafter (Krois 1987, 27). 17. Liszka elaborates two traditions of studying myth, the theological ap- proach leading to hermeneutics, and the rational or explanatory leading to a critical approach (in his first chapter); although his criticisms are often valid when he discusses the sort of Christian-patristic over-determi- nation that argued that the "real" meaning was always a spiritual one that only the initiated could understand, and although I am generally in sym- pathy with his attempted "hierarchical coordination of explanatory, her- meneutic, and critical interests" (14), I often find his identifications of the ways critical religious hermeneutics function to represent a different, more arbitrary pattern than I recognize across the history of hermeneu- tics. Traditionally, for instance, interpretation is not the function of dogma- tizing the findings of the hermeneutical inquiry, but merely the second step, one which to be sure has to be controlled by awareness of the her- meneutical or phenomenological spiral. (The initial step, traditionally, is the exegesis, devoted to technical matters of the text; the second is the interpretation or exposition of the meaning of the text to the original author or authorial community; and the third is the application, in which what Liszka refers to as "interpretion" is developed.) 18. Lévi-Strauss (1982) may be useful for methologological clarification, but in spite of its classy illustrated-paperback production, I find it so dry and technical that I cannot recommend it except for specialists. Lévi-Strauss (1985) is what might have been labeled volume three of Structural Anthro- pology, but was too disparate a collection of essays; the chapter "From Mythical Possibility to Social Existence" is helpful on transformation (cf. my earlier discussion, Doty 1986, 223-28). The Jealous Potter (1988) is per- haps the work to be recommended most highly; few of his earlier publica- tions seemed as concerned to enable the reader to apply his analytical</page><page sequence="28">270 SOUNDINGS William G. Doty methods usefully. Mosco (1991) modifies Lévi-Strauss* alegbraic canonic formula for myth in order to develop it as a tool for analysis of culture facts other than myth. 19. Some of the recent animus against Lévi-Strauss surfaces when Richard Harvey Brown reacts strongly to Lévi-Strauss' "intellectual imperialism and lack of critical self-reflection" (1989, 66), his "positivism with a ven- geance" (64). The common critique expressed here is that in the long run Lévi-Strauss excludes historical experience and the subject, and thereby ignores the process of the generation of language and myth. 20. Such a perspective must seem odd indeed to Lévi-Strauss himself, since he attempts to distinguish his work from that of psychology: "the last chapters [of the 1988 work] which deal with mythic thought in general . . . show how distant structural analysis is from psychoanalysis" (1988, 13); mythic thought was already dealing with certain notions credited to psychoanalysis (131); and Freud's Totem and Taboo was, we learn, already anticipated by the Ji varo Indians (185)! In light of my quite negative im- pression of Caldwell (1990), I must mention that his publisher never did send for review the copy of his new book (announced for 1989), and I was unable to obtain it elsewhere. 21. My two attempts to make sense of Campbell's appeal within religious studies circles are Doty (1990 and n.d.b.). What is striking to someone who has been following Campbell's work since the 1960s is the consis- tency of approach - his last work refers to his first - and his manner of repeating himself over and over again (see Doty 1986, 52-56, for exam- ple, on the four functions of mythology, or 109-12 on the theme of the local versus the universal). I appreciate the fact that William Moyers brought Campbell before the public eye in unexpected ways, just before and after Campbell's death, but I am also somewhat annoyed that the public perception that Campbell represents a contemporary path-break- ing approach is not better informed by the historical reality. I doubt that more than one or two of the books cited in this essay have found Camp- bell's work directly productive for their own specific research. Certainly persons interested in the applicability of Campbell's perspectives to con- temporary arts must be frustrated except in the case of Star Wars: Camp- bell went out of his way in several publications to indicate that he was not interested in movies or other contemporary artforms, and anyhow, Joyce and Mann said it all, already. 22. That, therefore, no single "What Myth Means" can be determined is clear across the field. Explorations of the various ways myths have been or are presently being classified, defined, and signified can be found in the works by Honko, Birenbaum, Day, Waardenburg, and Doniger (O'Flaherty).</page><page sequence="29">Myth, the Archetype of AU Other Fable 271 WORKS CITED Adkins, Arthur W.H. 1990.
