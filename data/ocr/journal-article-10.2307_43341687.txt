<plain_text><page sequence="1">246 Hans Marchand NOTES ON ENGLISH SUFFIXATION 1. A suffix is a derivative final element which is or formerly was productive in forming words. A sf has semantic value, but it does not occur as an independent speech unit. In a looser way, the term is often applied to final elements of foreign origin which have a merely adaptational character. The chief representative of this group is verbal -ate which serves to adapt real or potential Latin verbs in -are. 2. It is necessary to point out the similarity and difference between suffixes and endings. Morphologically, two words such as citizens and citizenry are formed after the same principle of 'root plus affix*. At first sight, the conceptual structure also looks very much alike: the -s of citizens and the -rz/ of citizenry both express the idea of plurality, collectivity. But the differ- ence involved is one between grammatical function and meaning. The s of citizens is the inflectional formative of the grammatical category 'plural', whereas -ry forms a class of words with the semantic basis. 'group, collectivity of - - ' Thus, a suffixed word is primarily a lexical form. It is a com- pound consisting of a word plus a dependent lexical morpheme. An inflected word is primarily a grammatical form. It is a simple word extended by a grammatical morpheme denoting syntactical orientation. The formatives -er, - est as expressing degrees of comparison are endings, not suffixes. The underlying meaning is subordinated to the functional role of the affixes. In the sentence he is biggish, the word biggish is a self-explana- tory lexical unit, and the sentence is complete in meaning. On the contrary, the word bigger , as in he is bigger , is not an independent semantic unit in that it involves a syntactic relation (that of reference to the partner of the comparison), which leaves the sentence incomplete in meaning. 3. The distinction between endings as expressive of function and suffixes as expressive of meaning is not always as easy as in the preceding examples. Inflectional endings do not belong</page><page sequence="2">Notes on English Suffixation 247 to a book on word-formation. Jespersen does not make the distinction, but treats accidence together with word-formation in the sixth volume of his Modern English Grammar . According to the principle upheld here, -ing as a formative of first ptcs would not be mentioned. But -ing as a formative of the verbal substantive, though partly functional, also expresses various other senses and has moreover developed denominal uses which clearly mark it as a sf. Agential - er denotes the doer of a verbal action, but has also various other uses and meanings which make it into a sf . Adverbial -ly is a border-line case. However, the functional character is apparently dominant. The formative chiefly serves to turn a secondary, i.e. an adj (rarely a primary, i.e.a. sb) into a tertiary (subjunct). The difference of quick and quickly is one of function rather than meaning. 4. As to the origin of sfs, there are two ways in which a sf may come into existence: 1) the sf was once an independent word but is no longer one; 2) the sf has originated as such, usually as a result of secretion. Case 1) applies to a few native sfs only. The sfs -dom and -hood are independent words still in OE so the process of a second-word becoming a sf can be observed historically. In other Germanic languages a similar development has taken place for the equivalent of E -ship.1 An instance of case 2) is the sf -ling which is simply the extended form of sf - ing in words whose stem ended in -L Half-way between second-words and sfs are certain second elements which are still felt to be words though they are no longer used in isolation. Only as second parts of cbs exist - monger , - wright , - wise . We may call them 'semi-suffixes'. The fact that a word is frequently used as second element of a cb gives us no right to call it a suffix. No sfs are - caster (as in broadcaster, gamecaster , newscaster ), - fiend (as in the AE 1 W.

The majority of sfs came into existence through being the characteristic termination of a group of semantically related words. Jespersen has called this process 'secretion'. It is usually (though not on principle) with non-native words that terminations come to be apprehended as sfs. There was originally no sf - erer ; the sf split off from words such as cella- rer, pewterer. Aristocracy, pluiocracy, democracy yielded -ocracy as a new sf with words such as landocracy, snobocracy, mobo- cracy, cottonocracy, pedantocracy . Parallel to -ocracy goes -ocrat, as in monocrat, mobocrat, plutocrat, a most popular word in political slang, bankocrat, shopocrat (not used in AE1), In the American election campaign words Hoovercrat, Willkiecrat etc. -erat is, however, short for democrat . From landscape (which is Du landschap) resulted scape, which is almost only used as the second element of cbs, as in seascape 1799 and later earthscape, cloudscape, sandscape, mountainscape, moonscape, parkscape, skyscape, waterscape, house-scape, roadscape, mind- scape. The word telegram 1852 gave rise to cablegram , radio- gram, pidgeongram, lettergram where -gram is short for telegram. Bootlegger attracted booklegger 'one trading in obscene books', foodlegger 'illicit food seller', meatlegger, tirelegger (used at a time when things were rationed in U.S.). The word hierarchy attracted squirearchy 1804, which does not, however, mean that there is a suffix -archy (listed as such by Jespersen.2 The attraction is prob, due to the rime only, and other coinings have not been made. After multitude 1 H. L. Mencken, The American Language. Fourth Edition. New York 1936. Spl. I. 369. 2 O. Jespersen, A Modern English Grammar. Part VI. Morpho- logy.

Rectitude (= LL rectitudo) caused the nonce-word correctitude (q. Jesp. VI. 24.98), adaptitude 1842 is a blend of adapt and aptitude . But such coinings do not make for a 'suffix' -tude (treated Jesp. L c.). A similar case is of -son, which has formed a few nautical terms, blends with the word keelson , kelson ME a line of timber inside a ship, parallel with the keel', as stemson 'the timber fitted into the angle formed by the junction of stem and keelson ' 1769, stemson 'the timber fitted into the angle formed by the junction of stern-post and keelson ' 1846. 6. American English are words like fruitade , gingerade , limeade , pineappleade etc.1 formed with the suffix -ade, after lemonade, orangeade. They are of established currency now, unlike words in -cade: cavalcade attracted such coinings as aerocade, autocade, camelcade, motorcade, aquacade, quite recent words which may or may not stand the test of time. Spurious coinings also are some American words, coined after marathon , with -athon taken as a characteristic ending, as danceathon , ivalkathon, readathon, swimathon , speeadathon, talkathon and a few more, all cropping up in the 1930's,2 but none of them in serious use, so far as StAE is concerned. Of the same kind are a number of AE words, quoted by Mencken (AL4, 179) in - torium , all denoting a place connected with what is implied in the basis. The starting-point seems to be pastorium which »is widely used in the South, especially among the Baptists, in place of parsonage ». The word was coined c. 1898, perh. after auditorium , refectorium and the like. It has subse- quently attracted such 'learned' barbarisms as beautorium , barberatorium, corsetorium, eatatorium, infantorium, healtha - torium, motortorium, odditorium, printorium, restorium, shoe - torium. They show efficiency in word-production at its best. 1 H. L. Mencken, op. cit. 358. 2 » » » » 366.</page><page sequence="5">250 Hans Marchand Outspoken A slang is the sf -er o o with endearing force which has coined such words as flopperoo , checkeroo , jokeroo , bummeroo, kisseroo. H. Wentworth 1 supposes that the starting- point is buckaroo , a corruption of Spanish, vaquero 'cowboy*. From the German words sängerfest and turnfest , which were first used in the early 50's in U.S.A., a series of other words with the suffix (or is -fest felt to be a word?) were derived, beginning about 1900: smokefest , walkfesU eatfest, stuntfest , boozefesU bookfest , beef ing-f est, gabfest ao2. Another AE sf is - teria with meaning 'shop, store, establishment*. The starting-point is prob. Mexican Spanish cafeteria which passed into American English (first used about 1893) and has attracted a good number of words, chiefly since 1930. Mencken has about 50 words, such as basketeria, caketeria , candyteria, cleaneteria , luncheteria , drygoodsteria , drugteria , fruiteria , shoeteria , chocolatería , furnitureteria, etc. The original implication was 'place where articles are sold on the selfservice plan' (so in the latest coining gas-a~teria9 Life International , vol. 5.48, Dec. 6, 1948). The original stress is on the i, but the stronger tendency now is to stress - téria . The sf is discussed at length in Mencken8 with reference to quite an extensive literature. 7. In PE there are nominal and verbal sfs. The sfs - fold , - most , and - ward form words which are used both as adjs and adverbs. From the formal point of view, the only group that needs an explanation are the verbal sfs. We remember that there was no formation of compound vbs with a noun (sb or adj) for a first- word in OE (see 49). As we take compounding to be the historical stage preceding suffixing, we shall not be surprised to see that there are no old verbal sfs deriving from a nominal 1 American Speech 1942, p. 10 ff., 1943, p. 71. 2 L. Pound, Domestication' of the suffix - fest . Dialect Notes. Vol. IV. Part V. 1916. 8 H. L. Mencken, op. cit. 350 - 354.</page><page sequence="6">Notes on English Suffixation 251 basis. The old form of derivation in such cases was that of stem conversion (derivation without a derivative morpheme). PE -ate, - ify , and -ize are due to foreign influences. On the other hand, we have two sfs (-er and -le) deriving from verbal bases which form iterative and frequentative vbs. 8. The number of derivative morphemes is naturally infini- tely smaller than that of independent words. Their vaguer semantic content allows them to enter into many more cbs than full words do. It is in this way that they become classifiers, group formatives; and classes, as the higher units, are naturally fewer than the parts of which they are composed, i.e. words, in our case. On the other hand, the vaguer semantic character of the sf leaves this much freer than the word to develop a great number of meanings (though not with all sfs alike). The development of such meanings is conditioned by the partic- ular semantic character of the basis to which the sf is attached, also by the linguistic circumstances in which the coining is made. In general parlance, a fiver is a bill of five (dollars or pounds), in cricket jargon it is a hit for five, in school life it may denote a boy who always scrapes through with a five. A greening is a green variety of apple or pear, but a whiting is a white variety of fish. For other possibilities see -er and - ing , for instance. Some concepts are apt to be represented by sfs in many languages, as those of condition (state, quality etc.), appurtenance, collectivity, endearment, agent a.o., but theoretically there is no telling what concept may not develop to find expression in a sf. French has a sf -ier (t. pommier) to denote fruit trees, there is L -ile for the idea of 'stable for domestic animals', OGr had a sf -itis (t. nephritis) meaning 'disease'. These have no parallels in native English, or in German either. But no intrinsic linguistic principle is involved in the absence of such morphemes. The rise of new sfs in English goes to corroborate this. 9. A few words are needed with regard to deverbal deriva- tives. A deverbal derivative is not fundámentally different</page><page sequence="7">252 Hans Marchand. from a cpd whose first member is a verb stem., so, as in the case of penominal sfs, a great number of meanings are possible. In practice, however, the possibilities are much restricted. Deverbal sfs express grammatical functions rather than semantic concepts, and the usual implications are 'act, fact, instance of - ' ( arrival , guidance , warning ', sometimes 'state of - ' ( starvation , bewilderment ), 'agent' (personal or impersonal: baker , eraser , disinfectant ), 'personal object' (direct or indirect, only with -ee: transferee , draftee), 'object of result' ( breakage , savings), 'place' (settlement, brewery, lodgings). Similar consi- derations apply to derivation with a zero morpheme (pick- pocket, blackout look). 10. Prefixes and Suffixes. - - The difference between a prf and a sf is that a prefix is an extinct first-word and a sf an extinct second-word, on principle at least. As the first- word of a cb is not the grammatically dominant part, the prefix can only modify the word to which it is affixed without having any hold on its grammatical position. A prefix for- mation belongs to the category the unprefixed word belongs to. In a suffix formation, however, the full word is but the grammatically subordinated part. A suffix formation follows the category the suffix has established as its domain. Now, if we take compounding to be the preliminary stage of suffixing (always speaking on principle), we may say that the idea of compounding is to subordinate the first-word to the second- word which, in most of all cases, is a semantically and function- ally different word from the first-word. Its petrifaction will therefore establish a semantic and functional category which has no affinity with the idea expressed by the first-word. The sf is the dominant part and determined by the full word. If we start, however, from coordinative cbs such as fisherman, messenger boy, the assumed development of the secondword into a sf would preserve the original character of the cb where the first-word remains notionally not only intact as the contents of the notion of first- and second-word do not exclude each</page><page sequence="8">Notes on English Suffixation 253 other, but even dominant as the idea of the first-word is more important than that of the second-word. The result is that the sf semantically determines the full word to which it is tacked. Suffixal types of this kind are sbs with a diminutive (endearing) or pejorative sf ( kitchenette , daddy , boy kin, booklet , squireling), adjs with an approximative sf (yellowish, bluey ), verbs with a diminutive or frequentative sf (patter, crackle). The preceding cases of 'suffix semantically determining the radical* help to explain how sometimes prefixes (which are determinants by nature) and sfs come very near to each other: there is apparently no wide gulf between t. yellowish and t. unhappy as both affixes have determinant character. Christianize (and similarly other - ize verbs) means 'make christian', but a similar change of state is expressed by en - verbs (enable, enlarge). Cp.also L permagnus 'very great' and E greatish 'somewhat great', L florescere and G erblühen (both denoting beginning action or beginning change of state). These overlappings do not, however, change the general principle of distinction: a prefix determines the radical, a suffix is determined by the radical, notionally speaking. The formal, grammatical dominance of the radical in prefix for- mations and that of the sf in suffix formations is, at any rate, never affected by the notional fluctuations of the relation 'determinant: determinate'. 11. To give a preliminary survey of the several methods of suffixing in English we may distinguish six ways: 1) Deri- vation with native sfs, as goodness f. good. This process involves no phonologic changes of stress, vowels or consonants in the derivative as against the basis. 2) Derivation by means of imported sfs under the same phonologic conditions as group 1), as lovable f. love . 3) Derivation by means of imported sfs, involving phonologic changes of stress, vowels or consonants, as Japanése f. Japán, historicity f. historie. The three preceding groups will be refèrred to as word-formation on a native basis of coining (wfnb). 4) The sf is not tacked to an English word</page><page sequence="9">254 Hans Marchand. but a Latin stem which, however, closjely resembles the word that stands for it in English, as scient-ist f. science. 5) The sf is tacked to a Latin or Greek stem which has, however, no adapted English equivalent, as lingual f. L lingua , chronic f. Gr chrónos. Groups 4) and 5) will be referred to as word-formation on a foreign or Neo-Latin basis of coining (wffb). 6) Words which have originally been borrowed separately come to take on the form of derivative alternations in English on whose pattern new words may be derived: on the analogy of piracy as from pirate , candidacy can be formed from candidate. This method will be referred to as correlative derivation. 12. The difference made here between the two methods of wfnb and wffb does not correspond to the traditional distinction between derivation by means of native and foreign sfs. For native sfs, as pointed out, the basis of coinage is always native. But with sfs of foreign origin the basis of coining may be either native or foreign or both. The sf - al derives postal , seas onal f. E post , season , and lingual f. L stem lingua , horizontal f. Gr stem horizont -, -ify forms dandify , monkeyfy as well as aurify, carnify , - ism derives both words such as Englishism » Irishism and Anglicism , Briticism. 13. Suffixing on a Neo-Latin Basis of Coining . The question of wffb will need a few more remarks. I will give a short summary of the laws of NL derivation, considering as Latin also Greek words which have been fitted into the Latin structural system. As English has only sfs beginning with a vowel as far as Latin is concerned, we need only discuss these. L words in -a drop the final vowel before the vowel of the sf: Rom-anus , aqu-osus9 Thom-ista. This explains E architectur-al , lingu-al9 propagandize, Spinoz-ism etc., derivatives from actual or possible L words in a . L wprds of the -o declension drop the genitive ending: equ - inus , ole-arius , offici-osus, miracul-osus , Scõt-ista. Cp. E ocul- ist , balne-al , cloistr-al (L claustrum, in LL pron. clostrum&gt;</page><page sequence="10">Notes on English Suffixation 255 yields OF cloistre under the influence of cloison ), asbest-ine (L asbestus ) etc. L words of the -u declension retain the ii: adu-alis, spiritu - alis . English exs are casu-ist, contradu-al (though it is at the same time analysed as English-coined contract-ual). L words of the third declension drop the genitive ending: mar-inus , su-inus, iur-ista , Aristotel-ista. In this group belong E carn-ify, multitudin-ous , carbon-ize , dramat-ize. L stems in - tat - simplify the stem into -t- : tempest-ivus , calamit-osus. This accounts for E derivatives from - ty words with an elided vowel: alacrit-ous, societ-al, facilit-ate, libert-arian , annuit-ant . When the stem ends in the same vowel the sf begins with, the vowel appears only once: Lat-inus (f. Lati-um ), evangel-ista, anatom-ista (f. anatomi-a). Correspondingly we have in English Americ-an , Kore-an , scientist, alchem-ize , allerg-ic , even a//faZ- ine (f. alkali). As L words in -ía, -ium are anglicized as -y words, we get the alternation -y / - ize , -y / -is/, - y / -¿sm (alchemy / alchemize , allergy / allergic etc.) Derivatives from adjs are similarly formed: E historic-ity9 femine-ity (L femineus ), technicality , spectacular-ity. With deverbal derivatives the stem is usually that of the second ptc: pass-iuus, absolut-orius , struct-ura. Cp. E product- ive , admiss-ive etc. Less frequent is derivation from the present stem: cad-ivus , with elision of the final vowel noc-ivus , opt-ivus9 a type imitated in English by appet-ize9 cresc-ive9 quer-ist . Learned words are chiefly coined on a Neo-Latin basis. Cp. for instance the numerous words in -is/, as scholarly or scientific terms all latinizingly derived (e.g. scientist , psychi- atrist , formed after L jurista , baptista). Words used in science, such as argentic , aurous, bromine , buccal are all derived on a NL basis. The sf -aster is English in the same sense: it forms words on a Latin basis as musicaster, poetaster , theologaster, criticaster, but never any such words as *writaster, *paintaster. Words in -ity, as catholicity , historicity fr. catholic , historic show by their</page><page sequence="11">256 Hans Marchand pronunciation that they are not simply derived from the corresponding adjs (historically speaking). Latin-coined are adjs in - atory , as informátory , observatory , investigatory , though many can be apprehended as native-coined. The sf - trix is termed 'a learned feminine suffix' by Jespersen.1 This does not really explain matters. We observe that - trix is only found in genuine Latin words, being the feminine counterpart of mas- culine sbs in -tor. Such words are chiefly found in legal termi- nology, as administratrix , executrix , mediatrix , testatrix . In Geometry, words in - trix denote straight lines. 14. What I have pointed out shows the influence Latin has exercised on the coining of English words. The great share Latin has in the English vocabulary has always been recognized. But this is a matter of linguistic sociology rather, whereas wffb concerns the physiological structure of the vocabulary. The forms of linguistic thought themselves are for a great part Latin. Similar observations could be made for other European languages (French, German) and for international scientific terminology in general (so far as it is not altogether Latin in form). 15. There are many words, esp. in scientific terminology, which are used in their Latin form. Many words have been coined on English soil which, as technical terms, form part of the English vocabulary. But as most of them have not been actualized (see 24), they do not interest us in wf . Their treatment belongs in the external history of the language. Such words sometimes acquire a semi-general currency, as AE oceanarium 'underwater zoo', vocarium 'collection of gr^mmophone records of the human voice', abortarium 'hospital specializing in abor- tions', ritualarium 'Jewish ritual bath'2, coined after Latin place-denoting words like aquarium , terrarium , planetarium etc. 16. Suffixing on a fb offers an aspect similar to that ob- 1 Op. cit. 15.94. 2 Q. Mencken, op.cit. 355.</page><page sequence="12">Notes on English Suffixation 257 served with prefixes. There are 1) terminal elements which are suffixes in Greek or Latin, as (in anglicized form) -ic, - ism / -an, - ine ; 2) such final elements as are really second-words of Latin resp. Neo-Latin compounds, as (in anglicized form) - scope , -tomy I -parous, -facient. 3) There is a third group of scientific sfs which are artificially coined, as though representing Latin or Greek sfs : -ad, -one, -ol, -yl. In wfnb we have termed sfs such terminal elements as can be tacked to an English word. In wffb, the decision is, however, not so easy. The word scientist is generally considered a suffix-formation, as - ist is universally held to be a sf. A word such as galvanoscope, however, is either not analysed at all or said to be galvano plus scope (OED). But what is -scoped The OED terms elements like galvano- 'combining forms' and elements such as -scope 'terminal' elements. This terminology only begs the question as to what these elements really are in wf . Neither scientist nor galvanoscope are analysable as 'English word plus affix'. Yet, there is a great structural difference between the two words. The radical of scientist is immediately connected with the word science of which it is merely a phonetic variant, so to speak. The case is different for galvanoscope and, generally speaking, for cbs with 'terminal elements'. The first- word cannot be connected with any independent English word as its 'phonetic variant'. Occasionally terminal elements develop into sfs attached to an English word (wfnb), as when we have words such as bumpology, bumposopher (both jocular from bump 'protuberance on the cranium as the sign of special mental faculties'), creamo- meter, speedometer, storiology, weatherology , dollolatry a.o. But, on the whole, these terminal elements coin words within the lines of wffb. I cannot agree with the structural analysis given by Stanley S. Newman.1 The »suffixes» which appear in horr-id, horr-or , 1 Stanley S. Newman, English Suffixation: A Descriptive Approach. Word 4.24 ff., 1948. 5 - Mitteilungen</page><page sequence="13">258 Hans Marchand horr-ify ; stup-id , stup-or , stup-efy ; liqu-id, liqu-or , liqu-efy (p. 32) are known to the philologist only, but an interchanging series - id , -or, -if y would be relevant to English word formation only if it became productive beyond the narrow group of loans. So long as it does not, the analysis of words with a dependent, unisolable theme remains an abstract description of a phenom- enon that exists in the mind of the theorizing linguist. For any unsophisticated speaker the above examples are nothing but one-morpheme words. 17. The English vocabulary has been greatly enriched by borrowings, chiefly from Latin and French. In course of time, many related words which had come in as separate loans developed a derivational relation to each other. The result is what may be called correlative derivation. Three types are possible. Type A is represented by the pairs 1) -acy I 2) -ate (as piracy / pirate ), 1) - ancy, -ency j 2) -ant, - ent (as militancy / militant , decency ' decent ), 1) -ization / 2) - ize (as civilization / civilize ), 1) -ification / 2) -ify (as identification identify ), 1) - ability / 2) -able (as respectability / respectable ), 1) -ibility 1 1) -ible (as convertibility / convertible), 1) - ician 2) -ic(s) (as statistician / statistics ), 1) -icity / 2) -ic (as catholicity catholic), -inity / 2) - ine ( salinity / saline). If 1) is a derivation from an English word, the only possible word is 2), i.e. if piracy is a derivative from an English word, only pirate is possible. The statement does not imply that for every 1) there must be a 2). 1) may be a loan, or it may be formed on a Latin basis without any regard to the existence of an English word at all ( enormity , for instance, is so coined). Nor does the derivational principle involve the existence of a 1) for every 2) (many words in -able or -ine are not matched by words in -ability resp. -inity). Type B is represented by the pairs 1) - ation / 2) -ate (as creation / create), 1) -( e)ry / 2) -er (as carpentry / carpenter), 1) -eress / 2) -erer (as murderess / murderer), 1) -ious / 2) -ion (as ambitious I ambition), 1) - atious / 2) - ation (as vexatious / vexation).</page><page sequence="14">Notes on English Suffixation 250 If 1) is a derivative from; another English word, the deri- vational pattern 1) from 2) is possible, but not compulsory. A derivative in -ation such as reforestation is connected with reforest , a derivative such as swannery is connected with swan, archeress is connected with archer, robustious is extended from robust (but otherwise an adj in -tious derived from a sb points to the sb ending in -tion, i.e. we have really type A). Type C is nothing but a variant of type A and concerns adj s in - atious , as flirtatious. Originally deriving from sbs in -ation, the type is now equally connected with the unextended radical, i.e. flirt (the older derivation ostentatious 1658 has not entered this latter derivational connection). 18. The preceding alternations do not, however, exhaust the derivative patterns. From the point of view of structural analysis the derivative system of foreign-coined words in -ic, for instance, is rather complex. Most of the words are ultimately Greek, and OGr -ikó s was very prolific. Thus the adoption of countless Greek words and the coining of others after their derivational patterns has introduced the anomalous system of Greek morphology into English. Of the numerous alternations this involves for the problem of wf I will give some of the correlative patterns only. - y I - i c. Most words in -y (ultimately repr. OGr -ia) derive adj s in -ic. This concerns words in - gamy , -graphy, - logy , -metry, -phagy, -nomy, -scopy and many others. Exs of alternations are monogamy / monogamie, geography / geographic, philology / philologie, geometry / geometric, anthropophagy / anthropophagie, astronomy / astronomic, microscopy / microscopic etc. etc. - i a I - i c. Most learned words in their NL form in -ia (ult. OGr - ia like preceding -y) derive adj s in -ic. Exs are anaemia / anaemic, hydrophobia / hydrophobic, analgesia / analgesic, am- nesia I amnesic etc. But from -ia words there are other -ic derivatives beside: amnesia derives both amnesic and amnestic, diphtheria derives diphtheric , diphtheritic (and diphtherial ).</page><page sequence="15">260 Hans Marchand. -sis/-tic. Most (ultimately Greek) words in - sis (regularly so all words in -lysis) derive adjs in - tic . Exs are genesis / genetic , mimesis / mimetic , anabiosis / anabiotic , electrolysis / electrolytic etc. (but ftasis / basic). t. - i t i s I - i t i c. Words in -iris (denoting diseases, chiefly of an inflammatory kind) regularly derive adjs in -itic. Exs are bronchitis / bronchitic , encephalitis / encephalitic, enteritis / enteritic etc. -ite / -itic. Words in -i7e regularly derive adjs in - itic . Exs are anthracite / anthracitic , dynamite / dynamitic etc. -cracy/-cratic. Words in -cracy (ultimately repr. OGr -kratta which gave ML - cracia EL, OF -cracie whence E - cracy ) are matched by adjs in -cratic (from adjs in - atique the corresponding sbs in - ate were back-derived in French, and the earliest - at words in English, aristocrat and democrat , are loans from French). Exs are aristocracy / aristocratic / aristocrat , democracy / democratic / democrat , plutocracy / plutocratic / plutocrat , i.e. the adjs appear at the same time derived from the sbs in - at . The pattern has extended to diplomacy / diplo- matic I diplomat. 19. Substantival derivatives from adjs in - ic are not only in - i c i t y, as the OED has it (s.v. -ic and - icityē9 cp. also the misleading statement: »Adjectives pertaining in sense to sbs. in -ism are formed in - istic ; e.g. atheism , atheistic, naturalism , naturalistic», OED s.v. -ism), but many are in - i c i s m, others follow the correlative pattern -ic/-ism. The semantic differences are decided by the character of - ity (denoting abstract quality) and - ism (chiefly 'condition, nature'; with many terms from biology and physiology: 'system, attitude'). Cp. alcoholicity 'alcoholic quality', alcoholism 'diseased condi- tion' etc., catholicity and catholicism . I will give exs tor each type, but it will be noted that some - ic adjs have derivatives both in - icity and -ism. atomic / atomicity, alcoholic / alcoholicity, catholic / catholicity, domestic / domesticity, eccentric / eccentricity, electric /</page><page sequence="16">Notes on English Suffixation 261 electricity , elastic / elasticity, historic / historicity , public / publi- city , rus/íc I rusticity etc. anthropomorphic / anthropomorphism, atavie I atavism , barbaric / barbarism , chemic / chemism, ego - centric / egocentfism , embolic / embolism , encyclopedic / encyclo- pedism , endomorphic / endomorphism , eugenic / eugenism , /ara- die I faradism , gigantic / gigantism , hedonic / hedonism , heroic / heroism etc. All adjs in -bolic ( embolic , symbolic ), -matic (astig- matic, rheumatic), in -tropic ( isotropic , phototropic) follow the same type. agnostic I agnosticism, catholic / catholicism , eclectic I eclecticism, sceptic / scepticism, stoic / stoicism, classic / classicism , romantic / romanticism denote systems and their respective followers. 20. Words ultimately representing OGr words in -ma derive adjs in - matic . This concerns the types problem / proft- lematic, epigram / epigrammatic, drama / dramatic. Exs are. problem / problematic, axiom / axiomatic, emb- lem I emblematic, diaphragm / diaphragmatic . With regard to its origin (OGr aphorismós), aphorismatic has irregularly entered the group. epigram / epigrammatic, diagram / diagramma- tic, chronogram / chronogrammatic, monogram / monogrammatic etc., but no words in which -gram has the connotation of 'message'. drama / dramatic, aroma / aromatic, asthma / asthmatic, cinema / cinematic, dogma / dogmatic etc. 21. Parallel to -ic is the sf -ous which offers similar alterna- tions. t. edema / edematous. NL words of Greek origin in -ema (in E chiefly stressed on the penult), denoting abnormal states of tissue, derive adjs in -ematous ([ema tas] or [irmatas]). Exs are eczema, emphysema, erythema, exanthema etc. / eczema - /ous, emphysematous , erythematous, exanthematous etc. t. carcinoma/carcinomatous. NL words in -ó/na [ouma], denoting a pathological cellular state, chiefly</page><page sequence="17">262 Hans Marchand cancerous or tumerous, derive adjs in -omatous ([ornatos] or [oumatas]). Exs are enchondroma / enchondr omatous, epithelioma I epitheliomatous , fibroma / fibromatous , glaucoma / glaucomatous etc. t. b 1 a s p h em y/blasphemous. Many words in - y , being adapted NL words in - ia composed of Greek elements, derive adjs in - ous on the correlative basis -y / -ous (cp. -y / -if). Exs of alternations are analogy / analogous ( beside -ic), homo- logy / homologous (esp. in Chem., Biol.; there is also' homo- logic(al )), monotony / monotonous , synchrony / synchronous (be- side - ic , - ial ), cacophony / cacophonous , homophony / homopho- nous (beside -ic; but euphony alternates with -ic, - ical , -ious). - latry / -latrous words, as idolatry / idolatrous , monolairy / mono- Ictrous , -phagy / -phagous words as andrò -, anthropo -, mono- phagy / -phagous, -gyny / -gynous words, chiefly used in Bot. and Zool., as andrò -, mono -, tetra-gyny / - gynous , -andry - androus words, chiefly Bot. and Zool., as #ř/n-, (ri-, po/z/- andry / -androus. The same alternation we have with a few loans from French, as in adultery / adulterous , lechery / lecherous , treachery J treu - cherous. h-osus appears in form - ose only in latinisms, i.e. coinings on a NL basis. In rare cases such latinisms look analysable on a native basis, as in globóse f. globe , gummöse f. gum. in BE, but they have been homologically actualized in AE where the stress is globose , gúmmose. 22. Another example. Words in -is/ are derivationally connected with words in -y, -ism, and -is/ic. t. archaeology/archaeologist. Exs are pairs in -Zo0ř/ / -logist, - gamy / -gamist, -nomy / -nomist (not astrono- mer ), alchemy / alchemist , anatomy / anatomist , botany / botanist, metallurgy / metallurgist. t. atheism/atheist. The alternation is between -ism words denoting a doctrine or system and -is/ words denoting the adherent. A few exs are idealism / idealist , materia -</page><page sequence="18">Notes on English Suffixation 263 lism / materialist , hedonism / hedonist , realism / realist , nomina- lism I nominalist, deism / deist, spiritism / spiritist. t. atheist/atheistic. It is chiefly from words denoting the follower of a scientific doctrine or system that adjs in -ic are derived. Exs are idealistic and other -ist words of preceding group. Derivatives from adjs in -ic involve the phonologic alter- nation [ik I isist], as in attic / atticist, historic / historicist , public I publicist, technic / technicist. 23. Suffixal Derivation and Stress. - This question has been much neglected. The accentuation of long English words of notì-native origin is usually treated with little regard to the derivative patterns which makes a few words here all the more desirable.1 We are, however, only 1 On English stress in general see O. Jespersen, MEG 1.5, and Stanley S. Newman, On the stress system of English (Word 2.171 ff.). In connection with this chapter cp. B. Danielsson, Studies on the accentuation of polysyllabic Latin, Greek, and Romance loan-words in English, with special reference to those ending in -able, -ate, -ator, -ible, -ic, -ical, and -ize. Stockholm Studies in English, III. 1948. This book has no direct bearing on our subject as the stand- point of the author is not morphological. D. is not primarily interested in the derivative role of stress though he recognizes the stress of underlying English bases ( = »derivative accentuat- ion»), p. 37 ff.) as an important factor causing deviation from the principal stress patterns. The chief cases relevant to our subject are words in -able (p. 55 - 86) and -ize (p. 192 - 216) whose stress patterns bear out what we have termed the homo- logical stress tendency in English. D. is sometimes disinclined to assume derivative stress. The words analogical, arithmetical, economical, harmonical, hemistichal, nonsensical, philological, phy- siological, simonical were formerly stressed on the same syllables as their bases, but D. holds that these stressings »are probably due to misprints» (p. 188). Why? The stress may have been derivative, but then a latinizing tendency set in: the stressing analogical arose from the Latin analógicus (with -al replacing -us) or as an extension of E analogie, the stress in the latter being</page><page sequence="19">264 Hans Marchand concerned with the principal stress, leaving aside the question of secondary stress. Various trends and tendencies can be observed as acting and counteracting forces in the English stress system. The most important factor is the tendency toward homo- logical stress. All native sfs and the great majority of foreign sfs are attached without causing the main stress of the radical to change its place ( good / goodness, father ' fatherhood , love / lovable , fulfill / fulfillment). With words of foreign origin or English coinings formed by means of foreign sfs which do not enter the foregoing group we have either preservation of the foreign stress pattern (in words borrowed or coined in the MoE period) or establishing of a correlative stress pattern. The following sfs involve stress shifting as against the stress pattern of thç. ujisuffixed basis. The main stress of the radical again due to the stress in the Latin analógicus with the Latin ending dropped (the stress pattern -ic had come to prevail as early as the 16th c., see Danielsson p. 186). It does not seem to me to matter very much whether a derivative has four, five, or six syllables so long as a word is derivatively connected with a certain basis. If D., who has set up his types according to the number of syllables of the words, establishes (p. 57) a type of pemptotone accentuation for aúthorizable , ltquefiable9 one of hectotone accentuation for álkali- fiable , mtneralizable etc., we would, from our point of view, simply state that derivation in -able does not cause shift of stress with regard to the basis. If we learn that hectotone accentuation »has never been very frequent» (p. 57), we should rather say that, anyway, derivatives of six syllables from tetrasyllabic bases are not numerous. But no stress principle can be involved in D.'s statement. If e.g. systematize had derived an adj in - able (it does not seem to exist), it could only be stressed on the same syllable as the basis. Homological stress is a greater force in PE - and Danielsson's extremely valuable book shows that the tendency is several centuries old - than one might think.</page><page sequence="20">Notes on English Suffixation 265 becomse a secondary stress in the derivative (the dash indi- cates the syllable preceding the sf): -al (only in certain cases), - árian , ¿ary (oqly in certain cases), - átion , - ée, -ten (both t. jackeen and velveteen ), -éer, - ése , - ésque , - ètte , -ial, -ian, -ious, - iána , -fe, -trian, - ity . 24. If a foreign-coined word has not been actualized (i.e. is not analysable as consisting of two English morphemes, word resp. stem plus sf), it seeks connection with another English word to which it stands in a kind of quasi-derivational relation (as systematize after system , decisive after decide , significative after significant ). We can only point out this tendency the study of which would throw interesting side lights on wf in that it would show how far words are connected for the speech feeling, which derivati onally speaking have no relation to each other. Loans or foreign-coined words show a tendency to stress the antepenultimate* Cases of loan words and their stress are not relevant to wf* but the tendency has jts place here insofar as many sfs form words on a Latin basis of coining (-ity, - ial , - ian , - ual ) or have become productive on a native basis in the MoE period only when the older antepenultimate stress tendency had long taken root (- ical , -ial, -ual, -ian, - arian , -arious, -orial, - orious ; - ic owes its stress pattern either to L -icus or older E -ical). The tendency also applies to cases in which a sf has a merely adapting function in anglicising non-actualized loans (verbal -ate, - ferous , -gerous etc.; - óloger , -ólogist, -ósopher, - ósophist , -ógrapher, -ógraphy, - ólogy , -ósophy, -ólatry, - ócracy and other -y (Gr -ia) words). Histor- ically it accounts for the stress in - ician , - átion which were trisyllabic originally. 25. In loans or foreign-coined words of three or more syllables the antepenultimate tendency is counteracted if the last two syllables are closed syllables or if the last is closed and the last but one has a long vowel or diphthong. In this case the last but one is stressed. Relevant to wf are certain</page><page sequence="21">266 Hans Marchand cases of sf - al (instruméntal as against instrument ). But it may be observed that homological stress is perhaps slowly progress- ing with regard to words containing a long vowel or diphthong in the last but one. Súicidal , for instance, is more frequently heard than suicidal (the only stressing the OED gives). 26. With sfs which acquired derivative force in the MoE period the stress pattern of the language from which the first words were taken, has not been changed, which accounts for the retention of stress on the sfs - ese (Italian), - esque , -eer. - ette , -een (French resp. for t. girleen, Irish), - iana (Latin). That - ee words which are very old in the language have the stress on the sf is probably due to their character as words óf a particular group (law terms). The retention of the foreign stress pattern is the same as that in recent loans from French in - age (masságe etc.), - ade ( barricade etc.), from Latin -ose (bellicose etc.). For other such words see Jesp. I. 5. 8. 27. The sfs of foreign origin which today involve no stress shifting are those which had derivative force already in the ME period. An exception is - ual9 for which derivative pairs existed before 1400. Homological stress, however, has not developed (with the exception of spirit / spiritual ), probably on account of the small number of derivatives, possibly also under the influence of -ial words. Other sfs have become productive on a native basis of coining too late for a homo- logical stress pattern to be able to uproot the much older rhythmic stress pattern that had developed with loan words (- ical , - ity , -ic). The sf - ician also has preserved the shifting ME stress pattern with the original French secondary stress on the first syllable changed into the principal stress. The trisyllabic form, common till the 16th c. (see Jesp. I. 9. 87), is probably one of the reasons. Otherwise the derivative relation magic / magician existed as early as the 14th c. With the stressing of words in - ation9-arian , - arious , -oriaL -orious the Latin has probably played a part. The speaker was certainly conscious of the Latin words in -a/io, -a'/ms.</page><page sequence="22">Notes on English Suffixation 267 -órius for which the English words stood. It is otherwise difficult to understand why no homological stress pattern should have developed between purify / purification , canonize / canonization though the derivative relations are as old as the 14th c. 28. Derivation by means of imported sfs, esp, those which derive on a NL basis, often involve phonological changes of vowel or consonant. Vowel and consonant changes most often go with stress shift. In several cases, however, we have vocalic and consonantal alternations but no shifted stress. Exs of the latter are: t. sincére/sincérity [ia / eriti], austere / austerity , severe / severity. t. bronchítis/bronchític [aitis / itik], otitis otitic , peritonitis / peritonitic ets. t. tenácious/te n á city [eisas / esiti], capacious ; capacity , predacious / pr edacity etc. ť. f erócious/f erócity [ousas / ositi], atrocious atrocity etc. Vowel and consonant changes are accompanied by stress shift in the following cases: t. artifice / artificial, avarice / avari- ci o ü s [is I íŠ9l] resp. [is / isas]. If a word in -ice, pron. [is] (or occ. [ais]) derives by means of a sf beginning with [i] (chiefly -ial, - iary , -ious), we have the alternation [is (ais) / išal, išeri, ises]. Exs are benefice / beneficial , beneficiary , auspice / auspiciai , auspicious , preju- dice I prejudicial, office / official , officious , with [ai] in the radical sacrifice / sacrificial , vice / vicious. t. mechanic/mechanician. This correlative type implies the phonological alternation [ik / isan]. t. catholic/catholic, ism, catholicity. If a word in -ic forms derivatives in -ism, -ist (usually without stress shift), -ity (with shifted stress), the phonologic alter- nation [ik / ršizm, isist, isiti] is involved. Exs are attic / atticism V</page><page sequence="23">268 Hans Marchand atticist , historie / historicism , historicist, historicity , aesthetic / aestheticism a.o. The preceding phonological alternations have derivative value. 29. As for the other vowel changes involved, the following tendencies are observed*. The, full stressed vowel of the initial syllable in the radical is retained when it receives a middle stress in the derivative. Exs are: pátriarch/pàtriár- c h a 1, politics I politician , editor ' editorial , secretary / sècretá - rial , manager / mànagérial , instrument / instruméntala alder- man I àlder mánie, aúthorize ļ authorization . The stressed vowel of the radical stands in the syllable immediately preceding the full stress in the derivative i.e. has weak stress. A distinction has to be made between vowels in closed and in open syllables. Short full vowels in open syllables change the vowel to [a]: hábit I habitual , valid / validity , ácid / acidity , placid 7 placi- dity, sb áffix I vb affix, sb produce / vb prodùce, [i] is retained: livid I lividity. [e] is changed to [i]: refreZ sb / refreí vb, sb récord / vb record, sb present / vb presént, edit / edition, tepid / tepidity, trépid I trepidity. Short vowels in closed syllables tend to be retained, with the exception of [o]: adj absent / vb absént, tactics / tactician, sb accent ' vb accént // sb excerpt / vb excérpt, sb export j vb export, sb éscort / vb escort // public / publicity, rùstie / rusticity (but sb subject [A] against vb subject (a); perh. because only prf SUÒ- has the full vowel?) // [o] is changed to [a]: complex cqmpléxity, confine / confine, cónvict sb / convict vb. Some long vowels are retained in quality and quantity, others are shortened though no fixed rule seems possible: [o:] tends to be retained: sb aúgment / vb augmént, sb torment / vb tormént, caúsal / causality // [i:] tends to be shortened: equal / equálity, légal / legálity, adj fréquent j vb frequént, sb regress / vb regréss // [a:] tends to be retained: artist / artistic, barbarous / barbárity, sarcasm / sarcástic 1 1 ļa:] is regularly shor-</page><page sequence="24">Notes on English Suffixation 269 tened: sb permit / vb permit , sb perfume / vb perfúme, sb férment / vb fermént H [u.] tends to be retained: brutal / brutdl - iïy, neutral ' neutrdlity, rheumatism / rheumátic . Diphthongs vary, [ou] is retained by some speakers, reduced to (o) by others in tonal / tondlity , total / totdlity , tócaZ I vocdlic , but the alternation [ou / a] has morphological value in sb progress / vb progress , sb protest / vb protèsi . [ai] is always retained in final / finálity, but in other cases it may also alternate with [i], as in minor / minority, cite / citd- tion II [ei] tends to be reduced to [9]: agent ' agéntial , fdtal / fatdlity , sdline / salinity , mdjor / majority . 30. The full stressed, non-initial vowel of the radical comes to stand in weak stressed syllable before the main stress of the derivative. Short vowels in an open syllable are reduced to [9]: Japan / Japanese , mechanic / mechanician , mathematics / mathematician // historic / historicity , atomic / atomicity . Short vowels are retained when standing in closed syllable: electric ' electricity , eccentric / eccentricity , augment / augmenta- tion , dialectics / dialectician // elastic / elasticity , retract / retrac- tation. Long vowels tend to be shortened: transfer / transférée , re/ér I referee // restore / restordtion , adóre ' adordtion // retard / retarddtion // extérnal ' externdlity. But cp. advantage with [a:] resp. [s:] and advantdgeous with [9]. Diphthongs âre reduced: [ai] alternates with [i], as in respire / respirdtion , admire / admirdtion . If a full stressed vowel of the radical receives middle stress in the derivative, it is not changed: res tórable / restòrability 1 1 supérior / supèriority // extérminate / extèrmination / / compatible / compàtibility , infldmmable / inflàmmability, spectacular / spectà- culdrity . 31. If the middle or weak stressed vowel of one of the syllables after the main stress takes the main stress in the derivative, it is raised in volume. In most of all cases this concerns [9] which may be raised to various vowels the choice</page><page sequence="25">270 Hans Marchand of which is often (esp.with proper names) merely dictated by the , spelling: superior / superiority [a/a], similar / similárity, mental /mentality [a/s], ceremony ' ceremonial , ceremony / cere - mónious , Milton / Miltónian [a/ou], censor / censorious, sena- tor/senatorial [a/a:], Milton / M iltónic [d/o], agent / agéntial, element I eleméntal, eleméntary [a/e], secretary / secretárial [a/e], minister / ministérial, manager / managerial , Spenser / Spense- rian [a/ia], Galsworthy / Galswórthian [a/a:], ammoniac / ammo- niacal [i/ai], anthracite / anthracitic ([ait / itic] is the regular derivational type), but suicide / suicidal , alkaloid / alkaloidal with unchanged dipthong. 32. Vowels which are weakly stressed in the radical as well as in the derivative are retained: mathemdtics / mathema- tician , mdnager / managérial , supérior / superiority , locáte / locátion BE. If, however, the vovwel [a] in an initial syllable (where it is always weakly stressed) receives middle stress in the derivative, it is raised to a fuller vowel: atomic / àtomicity9 advantage / advantageous, statistics / stàtistician, Japan / Japa- nese have the alternation [a/e]. Short [i] is sometimes raised to [e], as in respire / respiration, restore ' restoration, mechanics / mèchanician, refer / referee, sometimes to [i:], as in retard / retardation , retentive / rètentivity, retract ' rétractation . On the other hand, a diphthong which has middle stress in the radical may be reduced in the derivative if the syllable in which it stands is only weakly stressed. Alternation of [ai/i] occurs beside that of [ai/ai] in pairs of the type civilize / civilization . Cp. also the type edify ' edification. 33. Word- formation on a native basis of coining . All native sfs and many sfs of foreign origin are tacked to the English word without any phonologic changes modifying the derivative as against the radical, i.e. the process of suffixing in PE does not involve any shift of stress or modification of the vowels or consonants. This applies also to vocalic sfs added to a word which ends in a vowel (except [a] which</page><page sequence="26">Notes on English Suffixation 27 1 never occurs in antevocalic position). Hiatus is not avoided, a rule from which sfs of foreign origin are not excepted either. Exs are: agreeable , quayage . withdrawal, pursuance , Garboesque , storyette (the word balconette is not, as OED explains, from balcony plus - ette , but represents F balconet in spelling pronun- ciation), boyish , Wesleyism, cityiie , copyist , showy. Final [d] makes an exception when it is followed by for- merly pronounced (with many speakers it is still audible) [r] . The sounding is in many cases caused by the influence of the spelling, as recent coinings such as featurette, officerette show. Exs are: honor-able , peer-age , elector-al, author-ess , squir-et, thunder-ous, water-y . Derivation from disyllabic words in [dl] by means of a sf beginning with a vowel is under certain conditions attended by a combinatory loss of vowel: in cases other than those of [dl] preceded by [r, n, v, ts , dê] or a vowel the 9 is dropped in the derivative. Cp. feeble / feebly , sample / sampler , shuffle / shuffler , peddle / peddler , tattle / tattler , haggle / haggler , angle ' angler , pickle / pickler , sizz/e / sizzling , bustle / bustling where the phonetic change takes place with quarrel / quarreling , travel / traveller , funnel / funnelling , hatchel / hatchelling , cudgel ' cudgelling , /ewe/ / jeweller where it does not. Another exception is observed with the sf - ure , where in certain cases, we have consonantal alternation between [s] and [J], [z] and [ž]. Other changes in the radical are found with sfs which have for centuries ceased to be productive, as -ier ( coal I collier ), -ern (sou//i / southern). They are derivationally not relevant to the structure of PE. In OE the sfs -en (gold / gylden), -ish (Welsh, OE W elise f. yValh), partly -er (as in OE baecere f. bacan) involved vowel mutation. By the ME period the vowel of the derivatives had all become homologically refashioned after the radicals. Ablaut as a derivative principle with the so-called gradation nouns (rátf / ridan, bora / beran), was already dead in OE. 34. With some imported sfs, though they are like native</page><page sequence="27">After being one of the leading statesmen and wits of his day, Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth Earl of Chesterfield, spent the last twenty-five years of his life in retirement. Increasing deafness forced him to give up the social round he had always enjoyed and to turn to other interests. Chief among them was the training of his son, his godson, and Lord Huntingdon. Chesterfield's son was illegitimate but the Earl hoped to bring him up in such a way that he would be able to overcome the misfortune of his birth and take an honoured position in the diplomatic service of his country. The celebrated Letters to His Son were written for the improvement of this one person only, but because they express with precision a particular attitude towards life, they have not lost interest with the passing of time. They first appeared in 1774, twelve months after Chester- field's death. Before the end of the century at least twenty-six editions of the letters had been published. 2 They have 272 Cecil Price sfs tacked to the English word, Stress shifting is involved. This concerns the sfs -arfan, -ee, -een, - eer , -ese, - esque , - ette , -iana, -ual (partly). Stress shifting is accompanied by vocalic modifications of the radical with -al, -ary, - ation , -ee (occas., as in refer / referee, transfer / transferee), - ial , - ian , - ic , -ical (only the word nonsensical ), - ity ; with derivatives from - ic words also consonantal changes), - ual (partly). Derivation does not involve phonological changes of voice in PE as it did in former stages of the language1. Istanbul Hans Marchand 1 See my article in Neuphil.
