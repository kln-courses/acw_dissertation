<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRD BEHAVIOR. By Robert Burton. Bruce Campbell (Consulting Editor). Alfred A. Knopf, New York, New York, 1985:224 pp., 600 color photographs. $18.95.-Despite increasing interest in birds by the general public, few books present the findings of ethologists in a nontechnical manner. The gap has now been filled by this attractive, readable, and infor- mative book. Most major aspects of avian behavior are covered. The chapters are: The Living Bird, Flight, Senses and Intelligence, Finding Food, Diet and Way of Life, Com- munication, Social Life, Courtship and Mating, Rearing of Young, and Migration. The unifying theme of the text is the adaptiveness of behavior, including cost-benefit</page><page sequence="2">494 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 98, No. 3, September 1986 analysis of flight patterns, migration, social behavior, etc. Such an evolutionary approach is unusual in a book for a general audience, but the emphasis makes it much more interesting than a presentation consisting solely of various "tidbits" of behavior. Even ornithologists will probably find some new information. For example, we are informed that swiftlets (Collacalia spp.) carry nest material in their feet so that they can echolocate, that the young of Oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis) take 100 days to fledge (they can afford this development, slow even for a frugivore, because of reduced predation associated with cave-nesting), and that "milk" is not just given to the young of pigeons, but also to Emperor Penguins (Ap- tenodytes forsteri) and flamingos. In addition to presenting results of many descriptive studies, numerous experiments are described (such as tests of the Beau Geste hypothesis), another unusual feature of a "popular" bird book. In seeking readability by a general audience, some authors succumb to liberal use of anthropomorphic statements. Only a few are found here. Sunbathing is described as "en- joyable" and "more than a functional pursuit" and avian communication is "often extremely sophisticated, more so than immediately seems to be necessary. . ." Statements such as these are rare exceptions in a book that is outstanding in its scientific approach. The book is unusual in its breadth of coverage. It is concerned with the behavior of the birds of the world, rather than using only North American and European examples. The book seems remarkably free of errors. The photograph on p. 169 is mislabeled as that of a "Bushtit", although it is a Long-tailed Tit (Aegithalos caudatus). Common names are used in the text and photo captions, but the index provides scientific names. Most of the photographs are not only beautiful, but an integral part of the book, enhancing the text, and showing the behavior of a variety of species. Some series of photographs are particularly outstanding in their presentation of behavior: aggression and courtship at a Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) lek, an Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) opening an Ostrich (Struthio camelus) egg with a stone, a Green-backed Heron (Butorides virescens) fishing with "bait," to name a few. In addition to effective use of a series of pictures to show behavioral events, many individual pictures are especially memorable. My favorites are a Red-backed Hawk (Buteo polyosoma) with its head cocked to one side as it flies (obviously scanning), triple exposure of a Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) showing how its head moves from side to side to judge distance, a Fairy Tern (Gygis alba) having laid an egg on a branch where it would normally be safe sitting unperturbed next to a skink and a Toc Toc Bird (Foudia seychel- larum) that is eating the egg, and an African Jacana (Actophilornis africana) walking while carrying a young tucked under its wing. In a book with so many photographs used to demonstrate behavior, it is not surprising that some are of poor quality, and a few are questionable choices as they are so small that the birds appear as tiny dots. Despite these minor flaws, the book succeeds in presenting not just a remarkable collection of photographs of perched or flying birds, as is the usual case, but of birds engaged in a variety of behavioral activities. This is a book that can be read and enjoyed by all. It might even be appropriate for use as an adjunct text in an ornithology course. "Bird Behavior" should inspire many to a greater appreciation of why birds behave the way they do. At $18.95 it is also a bargain.-MILLICENT S. FICKEN.</page></plain_text>
