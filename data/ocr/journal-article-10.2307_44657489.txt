<plain_text><page sequence="1">740579 Anthropomorphic Dummy and Human Volunteer Tests of Advanced and/or Passive Belt Restraint Systems Thomas H. Glei' National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator SEAT BELT SYSTEMS offered to the motorist are a very effective and low cost safety system. A number of studies have shown that they are effective in reduc- ing injuries. If additional research and development effort were put into the improvement of belt systems, optimized systems could be developed which would increase the protection for automobile occupants and further reduce injuries. They could also be made more comfortable and convenient, which would stim- ulate more people to use their seat belts. Seat belt technology has progressed significantly in the last few years. New developments include energy absorb- ing (EA) webbing, emergency locking retractors, con- tinuous-loop belt configurations, belt pretensioning devices, warning systems associated with seat occu- pancy sensors, and ignition interlocks. Several fully passive belt systems have been developed by various restraint system manufacturers and by automobile manufacturers. The Research Institute of NHTSA has been con- ducting a dynamic sled test program for the evalua- tion of advanced belt restraint systems entitled im- pact Biodynamics of Driver and Passenger Restraint Systems." Sled tests are being conducted on the Hor- izontal Accelerator by the Crew Systems Department at the Naval Air Development Center (NADC) , Phila- delphia, under Interagency Agreement DOT-HS-063- 1-081. The program objectives contained in the Statement of Work for that Interagency Agreement are as follows: 1. To measure the dynamic responses of men and dummies when restrained by advanced or passive belt restraint systems and subjected to dynamic deceleration-time simulated crash pulses represent- ative of current model automobiles in the subcompact and compact ranges. 2. To evaluate the performance with living human subjects of the restraint system undergoing tests as a viable safety device for the protection of the automo- tive public in real world crash conditions. Originally conceived in the late summer of 1971, the program was designed to offer Phase I dummy tests of advanced or passive belt restraint systems and Phase II tests with human volunteer subjects for the systems which showed the best results during the Phase I program. Since its conception, the program has emphasized the design and test of belt restraint systems for compact and subcompact cars. ABSTRACT The Research Institute of NHTSA has been con- ducting dynamic sled tests of advanced and/or passive belt restraint systems for compact or subcompact cars. Phase I tests using dummies have been com- pleted for eleven systems which were submitted by six different manufacturers. Test results are re- ported. Phase II tests using volunteer human subjects are now in progress for systems which generated good performance data during Phase I tests. The results of human tests of the first system have been very en- couraging. Successful injury-free tests of one volun- teer subject have been completed with a maximum attained velocity of 30.4 mph (48.9 km/hr) at an ac- celeration level of 21.1 G. Only the results taken from "quick-look" preliminary data are reported. Suggestions are made for additional research, development, and test efforts to optimize the perform- ance characteristics of future belt restraint systems and to improve their comfort and convenience. 2242</page><page sequence="2">PHASE I - DUMMY TEST PROGRAM In 1971, the Horizontal Accelerator located at the U.S. Naval Base, Philadelphia, was one of only two man-rated sled test facilities in the United States with an existing panel of volunteer subjects. The other man-rated sled test facility, at Holloman AFB in Alamogordo, New Mexico, was then being used by NHTSA under another Interagency Agreement for tests of prototype air bag restraint systems and was not available for additional NHTSA work because of other commitments on priority Air Force investigations. Restraint system manufacturers and automotive manufacturers were invited to participate by sending their advanced development systems to NADC for Phase I dummy tests. These tests were designed to qualify each system for later testing with human vol- unteer subjects. Letters of invitation were issued to all members of the American Safety Belt Council and to the foreign and domestic automobile manufacturers who had submitted information to the NHTSA Docket Number 69-7 on passive restraint systems. The re- sponse was excellent and the first of the Phase I dummy tests were conducted in January 1972. In all, eleven different belt restraint systems submitted by six manufacturers were tested during the program. To date, Phase I dummy tests have been com- pleted on the following systems: February 1972 - Takata-Kojyo Co., Ltd. (Toyota, Datsun) April 1972 - American Safety Equipment Co. (Gremlin, Hornet) May 1972 - Hamill M anufacturing Co. (Mustang, Maverick) June 1972 - Ford Motor Co. (Pinto, Torino, 1972 LTD - Baseline data from full-size car for comparison with compact and subcompact crash signatures) July 1972 - Volkswagen (411 Sedan) November 1972 - Volkswagen (ESV) April 1973 - Allied Chemical ' Inf la taband," (Pinto) The 50th percentile Alder son VIP-50A dummy was used throughout most of the Phase I test program with the exception of one test series. A 50th per- centile Sierra dummy was used in that series for the convenience of the participating manufacturer to allow direct comparison of test results at Philadelphia with the results obtained at their own sled test facility. In the latter portion of the program, a few runs were also made with the then -available Hybrid II 50th per- centile dummy. A minimum of two runs were conducted at each of the nominal test velocities of 10, 20, and 30 mph. Ad- ditional runs at 35 mph and 40 mph were conducted if the data from the slower speed runs indicated accept- able performance. Each participating manufacturer was given the option to continue to the higher speeds or stop at 30 mph. A Final Report (1)* on the results of this program has been prepared and submitted to NHTSA by NADC. The test results for all systems are summarized in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which have been taken directly from that report. Of the eleven systems tested, five systems (CI, C2, Kl, K2, and Si) com- pletely satisfied the injury criteria of FMVSS-208. The most difficult criterion to satisfy was the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for the dummy head which had to be limited to a value of 1000 or less, even though no head impacts were involved. NOTE: Direct comparison of results for different systems should not be attempted without extreme care, since the input acceleration pulse for each system was based on a unique crash signature for a particular car. The wide variation of sled inputs for the 20 mph and 30 mph tests of all systems is summarized in Table 1, which also has been taken directly from the NADC Final Report on the Phase I dummy test program. PHASE II - HUMAN TESTS A preliminary analysis of the data from the Phase I dynamic tests indicated that five systems (referred to heretofore as CI, C2, Kl, K2, and SI) provided performance which would minimize the dynamic ef- fects on human volunteer subjects during Phase II. All systems were given coded identifications during the Phase I tests in order to protect proprietary de- sign information for all participants. During Phase II, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to protect the anonymity of the participants. Therefore, the above manufacturers can now be identified as Volkswagen AG, Allied Chemical, and Takata-Kojyo Co., Ltd. Informal invitations to participate in the Phase II dynamic tests with human volunteer subjects have been issued to those three manufacturers. Obtaining Navy approval to conduct the NHTSA human tests at NADC Philadelphia was an involved and lengthy process but a necessary one in order to protect the rights and welfare of the volunteer sub- jects. A Test Protocol, a Procedures Manual, and other explanatory documentation were prepared and forwarded for approval by higher authority after a review by the Medical Safety Committee at NADC. These program documents were reviewed and ap- proved by the Naval Materiel Command, the Naval Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, and the Office of the Chief of Naval Oper- ations . For final approval they were then submitted to the Office. of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research &amp; Development. Various changes had to be made enroute to satisfy particular requirements.

The original request for approval of human testing was dated November 10 , 1972. Final approval was issued on March 7, 1973. The human subjects at NADC Philadelphia are all Navy personnel attached to various active duty as- signments at the U.S. Naval Base. They have all vol- unteered for "hazardous duty" testing of various Navy flight safety equipment, which involves the use of high altitude chambers, oxygen chambers, the centrifuge facility, and the ejection seat test tower, as well as tests on the Horizontal Accelerator. In order to re- duce the amount of exposure in a dynamic environ- ment, all volunteer subjects used in the NHTSA pro- gram had to be selected from those members of the Hazardous Duty Panel who were not being used on other dynamic test programs. The majority of the test subjects are Hospital Corpsmen. Most of these men have had a considerable amount of medical train- ing, and some have had additional experience as bat- tlefield "medics." Therefore, they make excellent subjects, because they can be both objective and sub- jective during the debriefing process. Their training enables them to provide precise descriptions and eval- uation of any trauma incurred. The test procedures and safety precautions in use include precise control over the setup and countdown procedures. The first operation to be completed is the installation of the seat and restraint system which is performed by the engineers and technicians of the participating manufacturer. The Site Engineer in charge coordinates the activities of the instrumenta- tion and data gathering personnel, photographic per- sonnel, and other engineers and technicians. He is also responsible for an inspection of the setup on the sled, the test seat, and the restraint system. Prior to any of the human tests for a particular system, a series of dynamic proof tests are conducted with dummies to insure that all system components will perform properly. These tests are conducted at 40 mph. Before each human test run at each velocity increment, additional dummy runs are conducted. These runs serve several purposes. First, they are used to calibrate the firing pressure and length of stroke for the ram of the Horizontal Accelerator in order to obtain the desired test velocity and G level. Secondly, the runs are used as a further "proof" test of all system components. Finally, since the dummy is the nearest comparable size to that of the volunteer subject to be used on the next test, the belt load and accelerometer data from the final dummy tests can be used as a rough prediction of what the subject may encounter. In the Phase II program the crash pulses (accel- eration versus time plots) to be used by each manu- facturer have been "standardized." The standardized crash pulses represent an "eyeball average" of the crash pulses at each speed submitted by Takata-Kojyo, Allied Chemical and Volkswagen. These standardized crash pulses, based on a best fit produced by the Hor- izontal Accelerator, have, been approved by the par- ticipants as reasonably representative of the crash signatures of smaller cars. Human testing (2) requires a variety of protective measures to minimize the risk of injury and to elim- inate any unnecessary pain or discomfort for the vol- unteer subjects. In short, every precaution must be taken to protect the subject's welfare. During the</page><page sequence="7">2248 T. H.

EA webbing LL=688 early part of the Phase II human test program, the nominal test velocities of 10 mph (16.1 km/hr) and 12.5 mph (20.1 km/hr) produced minor neck pain. The so-called "ouch" level had been reached. Simi- lar results have been reported in other human test programs (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (12). Since this program is primarily concerned with the test and evaluation of advanced belt restraint systems and is not a biome- chanics research program, the "ouch" level had to be surpassed. Dr. Edwin Hendler, one of the Co-Principal In- vestigators, utilized techniques to eliminate head- neck involvement which had been suggested and rec- ommended earlier by Dr. John Paul Stapp from his experiences in his early test work at Edwards AFB and Holloman AFB (8) (9). Therefore, to avoid fur- ther neck pain, the subjects were instructed to place their chins on their chests prior to the onset of ac- celeration. They were also instructed to use all available muscular restraint to resist the effects of the acceleration, similar to the technique used by most càr occupants during panic braking in a real- world, pre-crash situation. The techniques were ob- viously successful, since the injury-free test runs reported herein are the highest velocity and G levels ever attained by human volunteer subjects when re- strained by a three -point automotive type belt re- straint system. The first series of human tests to be completed during the Phase II program has provided some very encouraging results. Data and figures which are pre- sented herein were generated during the tests of a passive belt restraint system submitted by Takata- Kojyo Co. Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan. In normal use, the Takata system is fully passive in that the lap and shoulder belts are mechanically deployed around the occupant when a seat sensor and ignition interlock are energized. Since these eleihents are only used to meet passivity requirements, it was not necessary to utilize them during the test program in either Phase I or Phase II. The restraint system is wholly con- tained in a padded and upholstered, structurally- reinforced, moulded fiberglass bucket seat.

Emergency locking re- tractors are used on both the lap and shoulder belts. Perhaps the most important result obtained to date is that higher injury-free velocity and G levels have been obtained. Test runs in excess of 20 mph (32.18 km/hr) with a 3-point automotive type lap and shoulder belt restraint system have never been ac- complished heretofore without a significant amount of trauma as shown in Table II. Other protective measures were also used. First, small increments of "stepped severity" are a re- quirement in human test programs. Therefore, all tests were conducted using small increment levels of 2.5 (4 km/hr), starting at 5 mph (8 km/hr). Second, ample time must be allowed between tests for any bruises, lacerations, or muscle soreness to dissi- pate or to prevent further aggravation of any trauma. In addition, time must be allowed for any latent symp- toms to manifest themselves. Therefore, a minimum of seven days between runs was required for all sub- jects. Third, post-test physical examinations were given to all subjects at 24, 48, and 72 hour intervals. Fourth, a safety harness was used as a secondary, back-up restraint system in the event of a catastrophic failure of the primary system. Since the back-up re- straint system was connected in a completely slack condition, it did not impede or affect the action of the primary system. Finally, all data and the high-speed films were reviewed and discussed by the Principal Investigators and Site personnel as soon as possible after each run. Recommendations were then made to the Medical Safety Committee, composed of Flight Surgeons, physiologists, physicians, and engineers. After a second, thorough review by the Medical Safety Com- mittee, a final recommendation to continue or dis- continue testing for a particular subject or to proceed to the next test level was presented to the Director of the Crew Systems Department, who made all final decisions. Each human volunteer subject has a distinctive and unique "riding characteristic" or riding pattern. Any prediction of what one subject will do or experi- ence from the data recorded for another subject is extremely difficult, if not impossible, even if two subjects are similar in size and weight.

It is equally difficult to correlate a subject's riding pattern with any single anthropometric measurement such as body weight or sitting height. Every channel of in- formation available must be plotted against attained velocities and /or G levels so that "trend lines" can be established for each parameter for each subject. Graphs should also be prepared for comparison of data for each parameter for all subjects. Exam- ples of this kind of comparative plot are presented in Figures 7 through 12. Readers should note that data is presented for human subjects VI, V5, and V8, who dropped out of the test program at various levels, as well as the data for subject V7, who attained the high- est levels. Data on relative dummy performance is also presented by using the plotting symbols 5 for a 5th percentile female dummy (similar to subject VI) and 95 for a 95th percentile male dummy (similar to subjects V5 and V8). A few data points appear for a 50th percentile Hybrid II dummy, which was similar in size to subject V7. It is interesting to note that most of the dummy values are significantly higher than the corresponding human values. Human Test Run Number 2683 at NADC was con- ducted successfully (injury free) on March 22, 1973, at a velocity of 30.4 mph (48.9 km/hr) at a level of 21.1 G. Figure 13 shows the sled acceleration pro- files for all of the tests of Subject V7. A reproduc- tion of the oscillograph trace for Run No. 2683 is shown in Figure 14 for those who may be interested in the time relationship of various parameters. A reproduction of the Subject Debriefing form for Run No. 2683 is shown in Figure 15. Information pertaining to subject utilization and frequency of test exposures is presented in Table III. Subject anthropometric measurements are presented in Table IV. Tables V and VI contain a summary of most of the pertinent data recorded. NOTE: All readers are cautioned to treat the data presented in this paper as preliminary data only. The data represents information taken from the "quick- look" oscillographic traces or rough interim status reports. At the time of preparation of this paper, the Takata-Kojyo tests were continuing, although addi- tional testing of Subject V7 above 30 mph had been postponed temporarily so that the Medical Director of the Crew Systems Department could request per- mission from higher Naval authority to exceed that level. A second volunteer subject (V4) was being tested, using the stepped severity concept described heretofore, to provide additional data at each of the</page><page sequence="11">2252 T. H.

Preliminary results of the tests of Sub- ject V4 are presented in Tables V(A), VI (A), VII(A), Figures 7 through 12, and Figure 16. Additional data from the tests , which has not been described herein, has been generated and analyzed. For example, ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG, and EEG (electroencephalogram) records have been taken. Kinematic performance data from the digitization and analyses of the high-speed films has also been gener- ated. Such data will be presented by the Principal Investigators at a later date. At that time, the final data of the Takata-Kojyo tests can also be presented after film analyses, data reduction and verification, and various other analyses have been completed.</page><page sequence="12">Kilograms/sec X 1000 2253 j- Lbs/sec X 1000 Qn t- LEGEND 5 5th Percentile Dummy _ 50 50th Percentile Dummy 95 95th Percentile Dummy - - V1 Human Volunteer Subject V5+95 V4 Human Volunteer Subject 10 - - V5 Human Volunteer Subject 95 V7 Human Volunteer Subject 'S - 20 - V5 V8 Human Volunteer Subject -» 5 I - - V1 5 3 V5 V7 J - V8 V7 ^ w V7 0 _ V7 V5 V4 V4 1 A V1 V4 /V V4 ° B * AA 5+95 »- / 5 ' X V7 / V1+V7 / VHVT)^^ ^ Y§ 5 V7 - / V4 -V7+Vñ/ 5 - -vv V4 0 I Q I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I - I - I - I - I - I - I - I - I - I - I 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Miles per hour L i i 1 ' i 1 1 1 1 1 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Kilometers per hour Total Velocity Fig. 7 - Onset of shoulder belt load versus total sled velocity - Phase II human tests oí _ J* 5 _ 700 r- 1500 r LEGEND 5 5th Percentile Dummy - - 50 50th Percentile Dummy 95 95th Percentile Dummy ~ V1 Human Volunteer Subject gQQ V4 Human Volunteer Subject V5 Human Volunteer Subject innn - ^ Human Volunteer Subject g V8 Human Volunteer Subject 95 V4 i 400- - 95 V4 ^ ^ m r ¡D 50 / S ¡D 95 / 1 - %,c V4 / V7 Í 300 " V5 V15 V4 J % - 95 V4 / V7 ŪC V5 ^ 5+V1 V4^ I 500 - V7+V8 /95+5 % 200 " /V VI V4 / y X- N VI - ^ V7 Sy &gt;/- V4 y • V4 N - V7 - Sy v/7 V/ ^Xv7 Sy 5 v/7 V/ 100- -V4^ ^ /95 95 y' V1 "V8 5 5+V1+V7 0 - Q I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I - I I I I I I 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Miles per hour I i i i i i i i i 1 1 1 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Kilometers per hour Total Velocity Fig. 8 - Upper right shoulder belt load versus total velocity - Phase II human tests</page><page sequence="13">2254 T.

Was of the same severity as previ- ous run. Approaching the severity of the 12.5 mph run (Series S belt), but smoother. Consciousness (During Accel): Remained fully conscious and aware. Impact time seems to be very fast. Felt shoulders move forward. Dit not feel himself sub- marine (vertical motion) as much as in previous runs. Pain (During Accel): Right shoulder trapezius muscle (super clavicular area) Pressure from lap belt Pain (Post Test): Right shoulder muscle sore Body Marks: Reddening over right clavicle due to shoulder belt Opinion of Ride: A real jolt. Ride was as severe as expected. Was as tensed up as on previous runs. Willing to continue if symptoms do not increase. (Volunteer stated that on 12.5 mph run/S belt, his body came to a sudden stop. With Series F he gets a smoother ride.) FILM OBSERVATIONS: Head prepositioned approximately 51 from normal position. Muscles tensed. Popliteal angle - 148°. Shoulder displacement (10.9 in.) has increased and is on trendline. Thigh displacement (8.6 iri.) has increased and is also right on pre- diction line. More submarining (vertical downward motion and hip moving out) visible than on previous runs, but difficult to measure. Change in popliteal angle » 61° (highest to date: may mean more submarining). Legs jacknife during submarining motion. Head smacked into head rest on rebound motion. DATA ANALYSIS COMMENTS: Shoulder load has increased but right on trend. Lap belt loop loads approximately on trend. Ratio of back acceleration to sled input has leveled off for three runs. Head angular response data approximately the same (still in safe region) . Head linear response data - resultant acceleration highest to date on V7 ; HIC and SI significantly higher than any previous run (two to one factor). Shoulder preload approximately 33//. Lap load preload equalled 55//. Fig. 15 - Subject debriefing form - run no. 2683 - Phase II human tests SUGGESTED FUTURE RESEARCH WORK IN BELT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS The NHTSA human test and evaluation program at NADC has demonstrated that belt restraint systems can be designed to protect human occupants in the crash environment. However, the program has also demonstrated that additional research is necessary to develop an optimum system, in terms of perform- ance, that would also be fully acceptable to the mo- toring public in terms of comfort and convenience and to the automotive manufacturers in terms of simplic- ity, ease of installation, and cost. Continuing technical liaison with several foreign manufacturers, various members of the American Safety Belt Council and with several automotive man- ufacturers has indicated that although some innovative features or components are available in some sys- tems, a combination of the best features of all sys- tems could produce a truly advanced belt restraint system. The author believes that cooperative programs with joint Government-Industry cost sharing should be put together to develop optimized belt restraint systems. Such systems could greatly increase public acceptance and usage. Optimized belt systems could also have a much greater potential in the reduction of injuries and/or deaths, because they could be de- signed to provide the maximum absorption of energy consistent with the space available in any particular vehicle.</page><page sequence="17">2258 T.

With the new energy absorbing bumper systems and structure frame designs spon- sored by NHTSA rulemaking or research programs , occupant restraint systems can now be developed us- ing systems engineering techniques that would take into account all modes of force limiting and energy absorbing components in the entire vehicle as well as those in the restraint system for maximum occupant protection. A development and test program could be under- taken, perhaps under Government leadership, indus- try sponsorship, or under the auspices and guidance of SAE. Additional sled testing with dummies and human volunteer subjects is needed to evaluate the new belt restraint systems that would be developed by such research and test programs. The author be- lieves that such a program would enhance the state- of-the-art in belt restraint systems without imping- ing on the rather delicate relationships that exist between restraint system manufacturers and their customers. Such a research program could have the following suggested requirements: 1. Investigate currently available components from all existing manufacturers. 2. Prepare a Plan of Work and Methodology that would indicate how each component, whether existing or technically feasible, would be fabricated and coor- dinated into an overall restraint system. 3. Fabricate and/or assemble all components into a complete restraint system that could if neces- sary also satisfy passivity requirements. 4. Investigate optimum location of anchor points and /or retractors for maximum comfort and con- venience together with maximum performance ex- pectancy. 5. Conduct preliminary dynamic sled tests with fully instrumented dummies and seats to determine the impact characteristics of an integrated seat and restraint system with various size dummies and var- ious seat positions. 6. Perform any redesign or repositioning neces- sary to improve performance characteristics based upon a thorough evaluation of dummy instrumentation data and high-speed films taken during the impact tests. 7. Conduct final dynamic sled tests with human volunteer subjects of various sizes in various seat positions and perform data analyses as shown in 6. above. 8. Prepare a Final Report summarizing the re-</page><page sequence="18">DUMMY AND HUMAN TESTS OF RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 2259 suits of all efforts which would also make suggestions on future research efforts needed. Several specific areas of technical development and test are recommended to develop a new genera- tion of belt restraint systems. On an individual com- ponent basis, the following elements could be inves- tigated: 1. Energy-absorbing and /or force -limiting retractors. 2. Crash or pre-crash pre-loading and/or pre- locking of belts . 3. Wider belts in the areas of contact with the occupant that do not have to be spooled into a retrac- tor. 4. Energy-absorbing and/or force -limiting web- bing. 5. Single, continuous -loop belts that can be ar- ranged and /or stored for quick, convenient application and removal. 6. Anchor point locations that provide optimum belt angles for comfort and performance. 7. Better integration of belt-seat interaction for various size occupants and seating positions. 8. Easier and safer locking-unlocking compo- nents . 9. Energy -absorbing and/or force -limiting ele- ments between retractors and anchor points or as a part of the anchor points, or between anchor points and vehicle structure. 10. Tell-tale devices that would indicate that a belt system had actually been used in a crash. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The primary purpose of this paper has been to present the preliminary data from NHTSA's efforts in the tests of advanced belt restraint systems for compact and subcompact cars. No inferences have been made or intended about the relative merits or performance of belt restraint systems versus those of inflatable restraint systems. The data and infor- mation contained herein has been presented merely to show that advanced passive belt restraint systems are available now or can be developed in the immedi- ate future to meet the performance requirements of MVSS 208. Any references to the kinematic performance of the dummy and human test subjects or the biome- chanics aspects of this test program have been kept to an absolute minimum or intentionally omitted from this paper. These topics will be covered in depth by the Principal Investigators in a paper to be presented at the 18th Stapp Car Crash Conference in December 1974. A number of advanced or passive belt restraint • systems have been extensively tested under controlled laboratory crash conditions using anthropometric dummies and, to a lesser degree, human volunteer subjects. The test conditions for the human subjects may have departed from actual on-the-road, real- world conditions because of their "tucked" position with chin on chest. However, since this tucked posi- tion has been used for many years as a standard pre- crash emergency position for civilian and military aircraft passengers, it could well be adopted as a precautionary measure by automobile passengers. Its effectiveness for belt restraint system test pur- poses has been amply demonstrated by the test levels in excess of 30 mph and 21 G attained by subject V7, the highest injury-free test levels ever attained by a human volunteer subject restrained by a 3 -point har- ness in a simulated impact environment. Other human tests of other advanced belt restraint systems will follow, in tests to be conducted by NHTSA as well as other organizations. The data to be derived from such test programs, coupled with the data which is being compiled from real-world ac- cident data files, must serve the development of newer, more advanced, and better restraint systems which will help us all in reducing the number of deaths and injuries which are presently being incurred on the highways of the world.

Ac- knowledgements must also be given to Mr. Mark Katzeff, Site Engineer, Mr. Leon Domzalski, In- strument Engineer, and to Mr. Eric Bloom who pre- pared the Final Report of the Phase I dummy test program and Mr. Joseph O'Rourke who prepared the data and curves for the results of the Phase II human test program. Most of the graphic and tabular mate- rial in this paper stems from their contributions. Particular acknowledgement must be given to Takata-Kojyo Co. Ltd. for their considerable invest- ment in providing the systems and the participation of three engineers in Philadelphia throughout the pro- gram. Messrs. Tornii, Jimbo, and Nakayama in- stalled the restraint systems, made all final safety checks on system components , and were invaluable in the interpretation of results. Their extended par- ticipation included a six month separation from their families and homeland. Special acknowledgement must be given to the Flight-Surgeon-In-Charge LtCdr Steve Rogers (MC) USN and to all of the volunteer subjects who have par- ticipated in this program. Without their participation and their willingness to undergo impact testing, asso- ciated with a high degree of personal risk, this pro- gram would not have been possible. Subjects V4 and V7 reached the highest injury-free levels ever at-</page><page sequence="19">2260 X. H.

Their individual contributions and willing- ness to continue to higher and higher test levels are beyond this author's ability to provide adequate ac- knowledgement. The Navy would say "WELL DONE."
