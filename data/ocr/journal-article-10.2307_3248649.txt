<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLIOGRAPHIA A. Bulling, The Meaning of China's Most Ancient Art: an interpretation of pottery patterns from Kansu (Ma Ch'ang and Pan-shan) and their development in the Shang, Chou and Han periods. Leiden, E. 7. Brill, 1952. 162 pages, 8plates and 89 figures. At the outset the author tells us that before the war "like other disciplines archaeology and history of art had already entered into a critical period," so that "it was obvious that without a drastic change in the general approach no constructive results could be expected." To this "the study of Chinese antiquity was no exception; it followed the same trend towards a rather sterile and misunderstood objectivity. This 'cult of objectivity' threatened to diminish the value of many studies because it neglected the human factor and aimed almost exclusively at establishing a sequence of stylistic modifications as a basis for dating and general information." The author then states (pp. I-2) what is, in her opinion, the proper approach: Only when the study of art is conceived as a part of the evolution of mankind can it fulfill its proper purpose. Recent attempts made by a number of archaeologists are more definitely directed towards this goal. They have tried to interpret the meaning of patterns or represen- tations of early Chinese art as an integral part of the religious and social ideal of different epochs.... It is, however, necessary not only to collect mythological and cosmological data and to relate them arbitrarily to certain patterns but to establish a method which can be safely used as a basis of research in general. A systematic and successful research ought to stress the need for discovering the foundamental principles which were instrumental in the formation of the different patterns. This means that we should apply scientific methods to the study of these patterns and adapt them to general principles. There are bound to be exceptions to the 'rules' developed by this procedure and in the course of time other scholars will, I hope, elaborate and revise suggestions made in this book. This work proposes, then, to expound and to apply a new body of method for the study of ancient Chinese art. Some of the author's criticisms of previous practice are surely sound. Some of her general observations concerning method are distinctly attractive. But if this book is a fair exemplification of the new methods which she advocates, this reviewer can only conclude that the remedy would be much worse than the disease. Miss Bulling is consistent in her avoidance of the "cult of objectivity". In fact, in its almost complete abstraction from any dependence upon evidence, her volume is at times as completely subjective as anyone could wish. By contrast, one looks in vain for any recognition, in the actual conduct of her research, of the principles that "the human factor" must not be neglected, that the study of art must be "conceived as part of the evolution of mankind", and that early Chinese art should be examined "as an integral part of the religious and social ideas of different epochs"-all principles that are enun- ciated on page one. In accord with them one would expect that this book would have much to say about 320</page><page sequence="2">the people and the cultures of Ma Ch'ang and Pan Shan. In fact, they are scarcely mentioned. It is true enough that little is known of either the people or their culture. This does not, however, justify one in assuming, without evidence, that any aspect of their culture must necessarily have been similar to that of late Chou or Han China, or of India, or of Mesopotamia. Still less does it license the assumption that any motif (and especially a relatively simple motif) which is found in the art of these various regions and periods must have had essentially similar meanings in two or more of these cultures. Yet this kind of assumption is made constantly in this book. It is most clearly stated in the concluding paragraph (pages 134-135): Although all major civilizations of the ancient world had certain basic features of their religious and cosmological conceptions in common, their art differed in many respects, but the formative ideas behind the art of the different countries grew out of a common attitude towards the universe.... According to the doctrine of the unity of the macrocosm and the microcosm, in which they believed, to every region, and to every single individual were assigned a parti- cular place and a special function as part of the whole. The patterns, far from being haphazardly chosen for their aesthetic value, reflected cosmic harmonies and movements, in accordance with Plato's conception of art as a means for attuning our thoughts to cosmic harmony and order. It is doubtful that many critical scholars would agree that "all major civilizations of the ancient world" shared "a common attitude toward the universe." In China alone, the attitude toward the universe changed tremendously between the beginning and the end of the Chou dynasty. If we knew that the people of the Ma Ch'ang and the Pan Shan cultures had shared a common attitude toward the universe with the people of Han dynasty China, of India, and of Mesopotamia, and that this were reflected in their art, we might have relatively little trouble in interpreting it. But this is precisely what we do not know, and Miss Bulling presents no evidence that it is true. Thus when she tells us that in Chou and Han art triangles stand for mountains, ergo triangles on Ma Ch'ang and Pan Shan pots stand for mountains, she has advanced our knowledge not at all. Aside from the question of whether the various cultures discussed in this book are in fact so similar as they are held to be, there is the further question of whether the cultures have been properly inter- preted. This reviewer does not pretend to be qualified to speak of any culture save that of ancient China. He has therefore requested an Assyriologist, Professor A. Leo Oppenheim of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, to comment on the treatment of Mesopotamian art and religion on pages I33-134. Dr. Oppenheim writes: "In less than 400 words Miss Bulling has succeeded in collecting a maximal amount of baseless generalities, and of the shopworn slogans which glib compilers have handed the naive public for the last fifty years as 'keys' to the under- standing of Mesopotamian religion. Her remarks concerning calendar, constellations, macrocosmos- microcosmos, etc., and the selection of examples and references are embarrassingly poor and un- fortunate. " It is also embarrassing to have to comment on Miss Bulling's discussion of Chinese culture. Every student of ancient China will find many new and strange things in this book. It is possible to mention only a very few of them here. On pages 7-11 there is "a brief survey of the 321</page><page sequence="3">meaning of motifs used in Chinese art throughout the ages." It is stated that "at all times, the seasons, the months and cosmological signs in general were the major subject matter of Chinese art..." The evidence cited all relates, however, to the Chou and later periods. Miss Bulling writes: The conclusion, which may be drawn from this evidence on Chinese symbolism in general and its relationship to ancient Chinese methods of time and space regulation in particular, is that if the ancient patterns of pottery had any symbolic meaning at all, it was most likely con- nected with cosmography, the orbit of heavenly bodies and with the calendar. This is supported, to a certain extent, by passages in ancient Chinese literature. The earliest symbols referred to in texts are all more or less connected with the calendar, stars and planets. In connection with symbols one immediately thinks of the poems of the Shi/ Ching. This work abounds in simile, and is as early as any extant Chinese book with the possible exception of a part of the I Ching or Book of Changes. But as every reader of the Shih Ching knows, its symbol- ism is not at all limited in the way Miss Bulling suggests. In the introduction to his translation of it, Arthur Waley writes: "The flight of birds, their cries, the movements of animals, the condition of flowers, dewy or rain-dabbled, the restlessness of insects, the sound of their wings, the fading of the stars-all these play their part in early Chinese imagery..." Miss Bulling refers to the I Ching as "the oldest book of the Chinese", but she recognizes that its Appendixes were "not composed before the second part of the Chou period" (p. 12). Neverthe- 1 Arthur Waley, The Book of Songs (Boston and New York, 1937), p. I4. less it is to the Appendixes that she appeals exclusively in her attempt to show that ancient Chinese symbolism was "all more or les connected with the calendar, stars and planets". But if we are to examine the I Ching as an ancient book, we should examine its most ancient portion. When we do this, Miss Bulling's thesis receives scant support. In the body of the text, the moon is referred to twice and, under the fifty-fifth hexagram, there is mention of the sun, a constellation, and a star.2 But these are lost in a multitude of other symbols: fauna (dragon, horse, birds, tiger, ox, sheep, pig, leopard, fox), flora (grass, willow, medlar), natural phenomena (rain, clouds), and numerous inanimate objects. 3 Miss Bulling may have derived her erroneous idea of the nature of early Chinese symbolism in part from her ascription of the Canon of Yao of the Shu Ching to the second millennium B. C. (p. 10). The authenticity of this document has been under fire, however, for more than half a century;4 few critical scholars would today assign it to a date earlier than middle Chou. The eminent Chinese historian Ku Chieh-kang has set forth in detail the evidence which leads him to believe that our present Canon of Yao cannot have been composed 2 The Yi King, translated by James Legge (Ox- ford, I899), pp. 182, 184, 185, 200. 3 Ibid., pp. 57-60, 72, 74, 77-79, 8i, 84, 91, I04, III, 116, I17, 130, 140, 153, I55, i65, I66, i68- I71, 178, I79, I82, I84, I85, 200, 202, 203, 207. 4 For a summary of this discussion, see Ku Shih Pien, Vol. VII, edited by Lu Ssi-mien and T'ung Shu-yeh (Shanghai, 1941), Pt. I, pp. 210-21 I. For a presentation in English of some of the evidence against the early Idate of the Canon of Yao, see H. G. Creel, Studies in Early Chiniese Culture (Baltimore, 1937), pp. 97-98. 322</page><page sequence="4">earlier than the reign of the Han emperor Wu. The data which, in his opinion, clearly stamp this document as a Han product, include some of the very calendrical and geographical details which Miss Bulling accepts as pertaining to the second millennium B. C., and which become fundamental to her thesis. 5 This is only one of many facts which make it clear that, while Miss Bulling sincerely believes that she is interpreting the culture of Ma Ch'ang and Pan Shan, she is unconsciously reading back the thought patterns of late Chou and Han. She is by no means the first to make this kind of error. All of us who study ancient China necessarily do it to some extent. We do not know the ancient culture, but we do know that of late Chou and Han relatively well, and all the commentaries encour- age us to believe that the differences were far smaller than in fact they were. This is the first work known to me, however, which makes such an elaborate attempt to read late Chou and Han ideas back into so-called "painted pottery" cultures. The book includes much discussion and citation of Chinese characters, modern and ancient. The incidence of error is very high. Romanization is careless and inconsistent, and wrong characters are given repeatedly. Numerous examples of what are supposed to be ancient forms of characters are given in the text, but these do not always correspond to forms to be found in the standard Chinese works on the subject. On the other hand, consultation of the standard works sometimes refutes Miss Bulling's assertions. 6 5 Ku Shih Pien, Vol. VII, Pt. 3, pp. 97-99; compare the work under review, pp. Io-I I. 6 For instance, the statement on p. 107 that "the ancient ideograph" for fj shang "depicts a slightly Since she almost never names the sources of her ancient forms, and her extensive bibliography includes none of the standard Chinese lexicons of oracle bone and bronze inscriptions,7 one is forced to conclude that she has quoted from some of the earlier works on paleography, which were often unreliable. She does make some use of Bernhard Karlgren's excellent Grammata Serica, but that work is not intended to be exhaustive, but only representative, in its listing of ancient forms. In many cases closer attention to what Karlgren has to say would have forestalled serious error. For instance, on page I20 Miss Bulling writes: The word hsii i means 'hollow tree, empty, hollow, the place where one inters the dead, an abandoned mound, and the place of sacrifice' (in the small seal script the graph for 'hill' or 'tiger' is often added, the latter being the sign for the constellation of autumn). The ideograph hsii | is a pictograph. On the left side r is the sign for an overhanging cliff which may represent a holy cave. The graph underneath Jf is interpreted as representing a gate. If we anthropomorphic figure" appears to be supported by the first four of six forms given. But if we consult the Chia Ku Wen Pien compiled by Sun Hai-po (Peiping, 1934), 3.1, and the Chin Wen Pien compiled by Jung Keng (1939), 3.I, we find that among the numerous oracle bone and bronze forms quoted there is nothing closely resembling these four forms. 7 The best of these are the Chia Ku Wen Pien and the Chin Wen Pien; see the previous note. The most extensive work on Chinese paleography known to me is the encyclopedic Shuo Wen Chieh Tzut Ku Lin, edited by Ting Fu-pao (I928). It does not, however, contain most of the data re- corded in the previously mentioned works, which are indispensable. 323</page><page sequence="5">compare this _JU sign with the hollow tree in Fig. 67 b, it is obvious that the former has de- veloped from the latter. We may, therefore, draw the conclusion that the ideograph hsii , depicts an ancient hall, or cave for worship, with an hollow tree in it which could be used as a gate. This is hopelessly confused. The left-hand (and upper) portion of the character is not J- "cliff" but f "tiger". And the lower portion, !j , is neither a gate nor a hollow tree, but is well known to be a variant form of iE "hill". Thus when Miss Bulling writes that "in the small seal script the graph for 'hill' or 'tiger' is often added", she has quite misinterpreted Karlgren's statement, to which she refers in a footnote. The character is made up of two elements meaning "hill" and "tiger" re- spectively. Thus armed with an equipment which the most charitable could not call adequate, Miss Bulling undertakes to solve some of the most difficult problems in Chinese paleography, expound new theories of the origins of characters, and correct what she deems the errors of her predecessors. It would be pleasant to be able to say that her success is as great as her courage and her industry. Such is not, unfortunately, the case. H. G. Creel Chen Shih-hsiang, Biography of Ku K'ai-chih. Translated and annotated. Institute of East Asiatic Studies, University of California, Chinese Dynastic Histories Translations, No. 2. 3I pp. Berkeley and Los Angeles, I953. University of California Press. Every book dealing with the history of Chinese painting gives some notes about the famous artist Ku K'ai-chih, who lived approximately from 345 to 406. He is the only painter of the Chin-Dynasty whose productions may be judged after three works ascribed to him. These paintings have roused a special interest for this artist and induced several scholars to occupy themselves with him and his works. Apart from the existing paintings the biographies of Ku K'ai-chih contained in the Chin- shu and the Shih-shuo hsin-yii were of course the starting-point for all treatises dealing with Ku K 'ai-chih. Dr. Chen Shih-hsiang's "Biography of Ku K'ai- chih" amplifies and rectifies the hitherto existing translations. It is divided into three parts: Intro- duction, translation of the Biography contained in chapter 92 of the Chin-shu and notes. The introduction contains the history of the sources containing the biographical materials and a sketch of the position of Ku K'ai-chih, of the persons mentioned in connection with him, and a character- isation of the artist himself as it may be gained from the numerous anecdotes told of him. As the most important of these were already known to the former translators, the impression gained by Dr. Chen of Ku K'ai-chih is in the main consistent with that already existing. The translation of a poem of Ku and of several allusions contained in Chinese literature give a picture of Ku's literary importance. The translation of the biography rectifies that given by Chavannes in T'oung pao, Ser. 2, vol. 5, Leiden I904, pp. 325-33I, in several points. Especially important are the notes in which difficult passages are explained, and some terms formerly misunderstood as the expression fei-po I |t are corrected, and indications given where places and personalities mentioned in connection with Ku K'ai-chih may be identified from Chinese sources.
