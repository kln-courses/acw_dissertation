<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF SPECIES SENESCENCE1 STANLEY A. CAIN The Universsit- of Tcnicssec, Kiioxville, Tcnnessc There are several references in the lit- erature to the concept of species senes- cence in which populations of plants are described as old, weak, conservative, and unaggressive, as distinguished f r o m young species populations which are said to be strong, competitive, dominating, vigorous. The population conditions are described in terms which commonly are also used to describe individual organisms when they are old or young. The concept of species senescence usu- ally is applied to local, and presumably relic, colonies of plants which belong to floral groups of a type called "epibiotic" (Ridley, '30) or "allogenous" (Marie- Victorin, '38). For example, we read in writings on the Cordilleran elements found in the flora of the Gulf of St. Lawrence region (Fer- nald, '25), "This failure of the plants of the unglaciated spots to extend their ranges into closely adjacent areas which, upon the melting of the Labrador sheet, became open territory ready for invasion is interpreted as a further evidence of the antiquity of these plants; at the close of the Pleistocene they were already too old and conservative to pioneer, although they were able to linger as localized relics in their special undisturbed crannies and pockets." In contrast, later on, we read, "The younger Arctic flora which made its way south, in eastern America and in Eu- rope at least, coincidentally with the ad- vance of the comparatively recent Labra- dorean or Wisconsin and the later Baltic ice-sheets, has not yet had time to set off local species . . . . and far from being the rarest and most retiring of relics on our mountains, these young plants, like the young of the human species, are ag- gressive, dominating and from mere 1 Contributions from the Botanical Labora- tory, The University of Tennessee, N. Ser. 40. youthful vigor inclined to crowd out the survivors of a more ancient cycle whose territory they had only recently invaded." (See also, Fernald, '29.) From the interesting discussionn of bo- tanical problems of eastern Canada by Marie-Victorin ('38) we can abstract sev- eral comments related to the question of species senescence. He says, "We are naturally led to infer that our living allog- enous flora is a survivor of an important and now largely extinct flora cornered on the nunataks during the Wisconsin glaci- ation . . . . We picture that since forty-odd thousand years, perhaps, they wage a losing fight against the sturdy northern conifers and their natural eco- logical associates . . . . It s e e m s too much for them. Through ecological pressure or through the failure of some essential biological processes, intrinsic or extrinsic, the old species have already sur- rendered most of the ground. They are mostly local, some of them extremely so, being confined to one mountain-top, or to one secluded cove by the seashore." A few paragraphs later: "A last word on a point that might have been raised at the very outset of this study. Is the coni- ception of a senescent preglacial or inter- glacial flora, vanishing gradually from northeastern America, defensible on bio- logical grounds ? Are there really such things as senescent species, and senescent floras in the present world ?" "I have often caught smiles on the lips of my biological auditors, when indulging in such anthropomorphic utterances. But I do not think we can escape a more or less guarded admission of this kind, if we look at the facts without bias . . . . Such extremely local plants as Cirsium minga- nense certainly seem to be doomed. If we could prove with reasonable certainty that these forms are disappearing because 213</page><page sequence="2">214 STANLEY A. CAIN Ecology, Vol. 21, No. 2 they are 'old' to the point that some essen- tial mechanism has ceased to be func- tional, we could open a new chapter of auto-ecology, and grasp at least one of the negative aspects of evolution." Professor Marie-Victorin then adds, "But we are now in possession of a first series of experimental data in connection with the 'health' of the allogenous units of eastern North America. A certain num- ber of the rarest relics and endemics have been grown for the last two years in the Montreal Botanical Garden. Quite un- expectedly they are very successful . ... What of it? Since there does not seem to be anything fundamentally senescent or lethal in the plants themselves, we are naturally led to concede the senescent con- dition to the allogenous flora as a whole." There may be occasions when our thinking on biological problems is facili- tated by personifying our concepts or by individualizing our approach to species population problems. Of this I am doubtful, but in the case of epibiotic floras it seems unnecessary and obscure to em- ploy the anthropomorphism of the con- cept of species senescence. There ap- pear to be other, and more satisfactory explanations. Let us consider two bodies of facts in this connection. First, each organism has a certain ecological amplitude. By this expression it is meant that an organism's range of tolerance for different intensities of a certain environmental factor is lim- ited. Some plants have a wider range of tolerance for, let us say, hydrogen-ion concentration of the substratum, than do certain other plants. The plants which compose a species have approximately similar ecological amplitudes. Thus it is that we can speak of the pH tolerance of a species and call some species calcicoles and others oxylicoles (calciphiles and cal- ciphobes). Also, it appears that genetic factors control the physiological attributes of a plant just as truly as they control the morphological attributes of the same plant. Of course, physiological adjust- ments by a plant are possible, just as tis- sue plasticity results in greater or lesser xeromorphisn-i according to the environ- ment. But, and this point is important to the thesis, the capacity of a plant to vary physiologically is strictly within the inherited limits just as truly as the plant is limited morphologically by its inherit- ance. A plant inherits a certain ecologi- cal amplitude. The second fact we need to consider is that species populations in nature are heterozygous and consist of tremendous numbers of biotypes. Within all large, wide-ranging, species populations there are geographical partial-populations which differ genetically from other partial- populations. E v o 1 u t i o n takes place through the isolation by one means or another of a portion of the large species population. No isolation, no speciation. In wide-ranging species populations mere distance constitutes a type of isola- tion and marginal or other portions of a population are frequently recognizable as varieties or subspecies without the devel- opment of any conspicuous discontinuity. Furthermore, these marginal portions of a species population are relatively less heterozygous than the species as a whole. We have thus set the stage for at least one explanation of the phenomenon which passes as species senescence. The so- called Cordilleran species which have been described as composing the epibiotic flora of the Gaspe and similar regions are rep- resented in the East by descendants from mere fragments, peripheral fragments, of the original populations which crossed the continent in intra- or pre-Pleistocene times. Although many of the eastern populations are classified as identical taxonomically with the western popula- tions of the species, there are numerous pairs of vicarious varieties and vicarious species. The common lack of colonizing ability of the eastern epibiotics would seem to be due to their relatively greater homozy- gosity and consequent narrower ecologi- cal amplitudes; ecological amplitudes which are at one and the same time nar-</page><page sequence="3">April, 194() OBSEIRVATIONS ON CONCEPT O1F SPECIES SlENE1SESCIE NCE 215 rower than those of their western couin- terparts, and narrower than those of the characteristic dominant acid soil flora of the region. The observations of Anderson ('36) are to the point. "The variation within fris setosa var. canmaden1sis seems particu- larly instructive in the light of its recent history. It is typical of those species whose once continuous range across northern North America was reduced to the northeastern and northwestern edges of the continent by the Pleistocene ice. In Alaska a large central region was left unglaciated; around the Gulf of St. Law- rence, on the other hand, the plant ref- uges in glacial times were little more than rocky nunataks rising above the ice. The results on the two sets of irises are just what the geneticist might predict. Even from the few specimens which are avail- able in herbaria one can see that the Iris setosae of Alaska are a varied assemblage The irises of eastern Canada pre- sent a very different picture . . . . Comn- pared to the millions of irises which might well have continued to live in Alaska dur- ing the ice age, those of the St. Lawrence were a mere handful. From that hand- ful must have descended the millions upon millions of irises which now carpet the meadows and shores of that region in early summer. Com-ipared with our other American blue flags they are a singularly invariable lot . . . . This conservatism of Iris setosa var. caiiadcnsis is distinctive of most of the glacial endemics (or near en- demics) of the region around the Gulf St. Lawrence. . . . In the case of Tris setosa var. caniadcsis the invariability cannot be a direct effect of time, for the highly variable irises of Alaska are quite as aged .... It is more probably an innate conservatism; a conservatism founded genetically upon the fact that these irises are descendants of a small and highly selected stock." Finally, it should be noted that recent work by Wynne-Edwards ('37, '39) has indicated cousideral)le doublt that the nunatak hypothesis, which is couple(l with the concept of species senescence, is everywhere valid as an explanation of the local occurrence of the epibiotics. Wynne-Edwards ('37) has shown that great numbers of the Cordilleran species in the east are restricted to the local areas of soils derived from basic rocks. Fur- thermore, the rate of rock exfoliation in proximity to continental ice sheets is so rapid in many rocks as to obliterate all traces of glaciation within a length of time much less than the post-Wisconsin (Wynne-Edwards, '39). Thus it is pos- sible that many of the so-called nunataks were glaciated. There would seem to be no need for the concept of species senescence. It is replaced by the idea of populations of nar- row ecological amplitude because of ge- netic reasons. Their simpler genetic con- stitution results from their vegetational history. Their restricted and scattered occurrences result from the restricted and scattered occurrences of habitats which are suitable for such species. REFERENCES Anderson, Edgar. 1936.
