Analyzing artistic production as integral to processes of cross- cultural exchange, this work has done much to complicate the cultural monolithism implicit in the term Islamic art. Yet much of this work is concerned with the relation- ship between Islam and its non-Muslim "others": there have been far fewer attempts to analyze or deconstruct the nature of the Muslim self, even when the adjective entails a reference to religious identity. Instead, par- ticular (and often competing) religious iden- tities are subsumed under the generic terms Islamic or Muslim , assuming and producing a homogeneity characterized by what Stephen Campbell has identified in another context as the "transhistorical reification of cate- gories of belief or philosophical allegiance."2 Recent scholarship on the rivalry between the Sunni cAbbasid caliphate in Baghdad and its Shici Fatimid rival in Cairo (from the fourth/tenth through the sixth/twelfth cen- turies A.H./C.E.) provides a welcome excep- tion to this general trend. When it comes to Sunni Islam, however, there is still a general tendency to retroject a notion of religious consensus that is itself a cultural artifact. As the historian Richard Bulliet has noted: "The mutual tolerance of different legal and doc- trinal interpretations of Sunni Islam that characterizes the later centuries [that is, the thirteenth century and later] belies the bit- ter factional conflicts between Sunni law schools that marks the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries." Bulliet emphasizes that in the absence of detailed synchronic stud- ies at the local or regional level, "it is diffi- cult to erase the image of Islamic social and religious homogeneity that becomes an article of belief in later centuries and suffuses general accounts of Islam and Islamic his- tory," and, one might add, Islamic art history.3 Favoring what Clifford Geertz character- izes as "thin" descriptions over "thick," the reification of medieval identities in ways that ignore their protean character has sig- nificant implications not only for our under- standing of Islamic history or medieval religious identity but also for the artistic production of medieval elites.4 Studies on cAbbasid-Fatimid rivalry have demonstrated that within the context of Sunni-Shici antipa- thy, architecture, inscriptions, numismat- ics, and even textiles could be deployed to bolster competing claims to authority. The impact of intra-Sunni doctrinal disputes on 91</page><page sequence="3">premodern artistic patronage, however, has received far less attention. In seeking to address a perceived neglect, this essay also engages another significant development of the past few decades in the field of Islamic art: an increased attention to the aesthetic and iconographie function of nonhistorical inscriptions, especially Quťanic texts, previously dismissed as meaningless religious formulas.5 Analyzing the role of Quťanic citations inscribed on monumen- tal architecture and portable objects, it seeks to demonstrate that the factional conflicts referred to by Bulliet are integral to under- standing the choice of Quťanic inscriptions on certain medieval artifacts, which func- tioned as discursive statements deployed in the service of medieval intra-Muslim (and specifically intra-Sunni) polemics. The Shansabanid or Ghurid sultanate of Afghanistan, which forms the focus for this study, is not particularly well known even among Islamicists. The reasons for this neglect include the relatively small number of surviving Ghurid monuments, their geo- graphic remoteness, the dearth of extant objects that can be securely attributed to Ghurid patronage, and the ephemeral nature of the sultanate itself, which flourished for just a few decades at the end of the twelfth century. By contrast, the prominence of the Ghurids in modern South Asian politics reflects their importance and political util- ity as the first Muslim dynasty to bring large parts of north India under their sway (fig. i ). The floruit of the sultanate, which cor- responds with the period of expansion into north India, was marked both by heated sectarian disputes and by changing patterns of artistic and religious patronage. These shifts can be understood as part of a dynamic process of self-(re)fashioning on the part of the Shansabanid sultans as their fortunes rose and their territories expanded. The undertaking was shaped by tensions arising from the strong regional associations of the dynasty and its transregional preten- sions, tensions that included Shansabanid support for a localized, pietistic sect of Sunni Islam. i .

Constructed of baked brick, the exterior elevation comprises three cylindri- cal shafts of decreasing thickness set on an octagonal socle and crowned with a small (and remarkably well-preserved) pavilion. The exterior is lavishly decorated with terra- cotta, stucco, and blue-glazed tiles. The 2. Minaret of Jam, central Afghanistan, twelfth century, general view from the southeast Photograph courtesy of David Thomas and the Minaret of Jam Archaeological Project minaret stands sixty-five meters high in the narrow confines of a remote mountain val- ley that is difficult of access and susceptible to flooding by spring meltwaters: its exis- tence came to the attention of Afghan and foreign scholars only in the 1950s.6 Isolated today, the mountainous province of Ghur, in which the minaret is located (see fig. i ), was a rather marginal region of the medieval Islamic world that converted to Islam only in the ninth or tenth century, much later than many of the surrounding areas.7 Ghur enjoyed a brief moment of glory in the half century after 1 1 50, when one of the maliks (chiefs) of the region sacked Ghazna, the eponymous capital of the Ghaz- navid sultans who had dominated the east- ern Islamic world for almost 150 years, and assumed the title of sultan.8 This dramatic event, which earned its perpetrator the sobri- quet Jahan-suz (World Burner), marked the abrupt entry of these mountain chiefs onto the wider political stage and the beginning of their meteoric rise from regional obscurity. Three lines of the dynasty exercised author- ity from Firuzkuh in Ghur, Bamiyan in cen- tral Afghanistan, and Ghazna in the east. The Ghurid sultanate reached its apogee under the reign of sultans Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad ibn Sam (558-599/1163-1203) and Mucizz al-Din Muhammad ibn Sam (569-602/1173-1206), maliks of the Shan- sabanid clan. The brothers ruled in a condo- minium, with Ghiyath al-Din the elder statesman of the pair, al-sultan al-cazam (the greatest sultan) in comparison to Mucizz al-Din, al-sultan al-mu cazzam (the great sul- tan), who acquired the former title only after Ghiyath al-Din's death in 599/1202-3.9 From Firuzkuh in west-central Afghanistan, Ghiyath al-Din oversaw the westward expan- sion of the sultanate. Mucizz al-Din was based in Ghazna, from where he expanded the sultanate's reach into the former Ghaz- navid territories in the Indus Valley and into north India after 588/1192. At its zenith in the last decade of the twelfth century, the Ghurid sultanate ex- tended from the Iranian metropolis of Nisha- pur in the west to the Indian city of Benares (modern Varanasi) in the east, and from the steppe of Central Asia in the north to Sind in the south (see fig. 1). The floruit of both flood 93</page><page sequence="5">dynasty and region was short-lived: the death of Mucizz al-Din in 1206 effectively marked the end of Ghurid power and the disinte- gration of the sultanate. The minaret of Jam can be associated with this period, for it bears the name of the elder Ghurid sultan, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad ibn Sam, and is believed to mark the site of his summer capital, Firuzkuh. Recent research suggests that the minaret, which today stands isolated, was once associated with a major mosque built of more ephe- meral materials, presumably the Friday Mosque of Firuzkuh.10 Since its initial pub- lication, the minaret has been recognized as the chef ďoeuvre of Ghurid patronage, the high aesthetic values of which are today attested by only a handful of fragmentary monuments scattered across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and north India.11 The Jam minaret is believed to be a precursor of the most famous of these, the Qutb Minar in Delhi ( 1 1 99 onward; see flg. 19). In addition to its importance for the history of Ghurid archi- tecture, the monument has become a national symbol in Afghanistan, while among art his- torians it has assumed canonical status as a cynosure of medieval Persianate architecture - an image of it is now de rigueur in any self- respecting textbook on Islamic art. Despite its renown, the monument has remained enigmatic, its date uncertain, its function dis- puted, and its immediate architectural rela- tionships elusive. Demonstrating a consistent trait of Ghurid architecture, much of the minaret is covered by script, contained in bands ranging in width from 0.5 to 3 meters that either encir- cle it or inscribe a series of geometric patterns on its surface.12 The two uppermost bands of the minaret contain religious texts, with the culminating inscription the shahãda, the Muslim profession of faith. Below this is an extract from Quťan 61:13-14: "And (He will give you) what is dearest to you - help from God and early victory. So give good tidings to those who believe. O you who believe."13 The three lower bands are occu- pied by increasingly elaborate and bombas- tic renditions of the name and titles of Sultan Ghiyath al-Din. A concern with legibility reveals itself in their positioning and in the use of turquoise blue glaze for the letters of the central historical text. The most extra- ordinary inscription appears, however, on the surface of the lowest shaft of the minaret (fig. 3). Here the entire text of the Surat Maryam, or Chapter of Mary, a Quťanic sura (chapter) relating to Mary the mother of Jesus, appears in a series of narrow ribbon- like bands that overlap and intersect each other to form panels filled with geometric ornament. The form and content of the inscription are unique in the Islamic world. In his review of the comprehensive 1959 publication on the minaret, Oleg Grabar noted that the presence of the sura "must be related to some specific event commemo- rating the building of the minaret."14 Since that time the raison d'être of this long inscription has been one of the enduring mysteries of Islamic art history. Although the minaret bears a foundation text, scholars have long been divided about its interpretation, with opinion split between readings of 570/1 174-5 and 5 90/1 193-4; the confusion arises in part from the absence of diacritical marks, which renders the Ara- bic words for ninety and seventy difficult to distinguish.15 The later date has long been accepted in most of the literature on the minaret. Consequently it has been identified as a commemorative monument erected after a major Ghurid victory against a con- federation of Indian rulers in 588/1192, which paved the way for the conquest of northern India. In light of this interpretation, references to idolatry and unbelief in the Chapter of Mary inscription have been read as allusions to the conquered Hindu sub- jects of the sultan. Epigraphy has thus come to play a central role in constituting the minaret as a symbol of Muslim victory over the conquered Hindus, taking it as a given that references to idolatry and unbelief in the chosen verses alluded to those who were literally outside the fold of Islam.16 A recent study of the minaret by Janine Sourdel-Thomine, the doyenne of Islamic art in France, has suggested that the cor- rect reading of its date is 570/1 174-5. This redating has significant implications for our understanding of Ghurid architecture and epigraphy. Redated to 570/1 174-5, the minaret is shorn of any obvious Indian asso- ciations, as it antedates the first Ghurid incursions into north India by at least a year.17 Sourdel-Thomine suggests that the 94 FLOOD</page><page sequence="6">3. Minaret of Tam. twelfth century, detail of lowest shaft Photograph courtesy of Warwick Ball minaret commemorates not the later Indian victories but the capture of Ghazna, the for- mer capital of the Ghaznavid sultans, from the Ghuzz Turks in 569/1173-4. The presence of Quťan 61:13-14 on the minaret, with its invocation of the victory given to the believ- ers, might offer support for such a reading, especially as many of the Ghuzz were pagans.18 The capture of the former Ghaz- navid capital was not merely a matter of regional significance but a pivotal event for the development of the Ghurid sultanate. After the victory, Mucizz al-Din was installed as ruler of Ghazna and elevated to the rank of sultan, sharing the sovereignty of his elder brother and consolidating the political struc- tures of the state. Identifying the likely com- memorative function of the minaret does not, however, resolve one of the central mys- teries surrounding it: why was it felt neces- sary to cover the surface of this remote structure with the entire Surat Mary am? Sheila Blair has noted that Ghurid patron- age of religious monuments (mosques, minarets, madrasas) was "part of a coordi- nated campaign to champion Islam . . . both to convert the heathen and to counter inter- nal heresies."19 There is an intrinsic asso- ciation between the suppression of heresy and the chastisement of unbelievers in the royal titulature of the period and in the "Mirrors for Princes" genre of literature that proliferated in the eastern Islamic world during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.20 A concern with both is revealed in the titu- lature of Sultan Ghiyath al-Din, as preserved in the colophon of an extraordinary Quťan dated 584/1189, the sole surviving manu- script that can be ascribed to Ghurid patron- age (fig. 4). This bombastic rendition of Ghurid titulature combines titles used earlier by both the Seljuq and Ghaznavid sultans to whom the Ghurids had previously been sub- ject:21 "The chief and great sultan, the great- est king of kings, ruler over the necks of nations, sultan of the sultans in the world, succor of the world and religion, the glory of Islam and the Muslims, victor over the un- believers and the heretics, suppressor of innovation and the seditious, the supporting arm of the victorious state, crown of the radiant people, glory of the shining nation, order of the world, Father of Victory, Muham- mad ibn Sam, partner of the commander of the believers [that is, the cAbbasid caliph in Baghdad]."22 The emphasis on the sultan's role as the promoter of orthodoxy and scourge of heretics is reflected in contemporary antipathies toward the Ismaeili Shťis. Patronized during the reign of cAla' al-Din Jahan-suz (r. 544-5 56/ 1 149-61), the Ismacilis were persecuted by his son and successor, Sayf al-Din Muhammad ibn Husayn ( 5 5 6-5 58/116 1-63 ) and by sub- sequent Shansabanid sultans.23 This shift in religious policies points to the protean attitudes of the Shansabanid elites toward flood 95</page><page sequence="7">4- Part of the colophon of a Ghurid Qur'an dated 584/1189 Iran Bastan Museum, Tehran, MS. no. 3507, fol. 198a religious matters and prefigures later more dramatic shifts in religious affiliation that will be discussed below. The insistence on orthodoxy in this doc- ument may also be a product of the close association between the Shansabanid elite and the Karramiya, a somewhat enigmatic Sunni pietistic sect known for its implaca- ble hostility toward Isma'ili Shťism. Born in Sistan, the eponymous Muhammad ibn Karram (d. 255/869) had studied in Mecca, Jerusalem, Nishapur, Herat, and Merv before seeking more remote regions of the eastern Islamic world, including Gharjistan and the recalcitrant region of Ghur, which his preach- ing is said to have been instrumental in con- verting from paganism to Islam.24 The affiliation between the Ghurid sultans and the Karramiya reflects the dominance of the sect among the population of Ghur in the second half of the twelfth century.25 Although the disappearance of the Kar- ramiya in the early thirteenth century, in the wake of the Mongol invasions, has led schol- ars (especially those concerned with mate- rial culture) to overlook them, they enjoyed widespread popularity in the eastern Islamic world during the eleventh and twelfth cen- turies. Karrami madrasas (religious schools) and khanqahs (convents) were established in all the major cities of eastern Iran and Tran- soxiana, including Herat, Merv, Nishapur, and Samarqand.26 The sect (which was not homogeneous but comprised as many as twelve different subsects) competed for patronage, material resources, and spiritual adherents with representatives of other legal and theological traditions, chief among them the Hanafi and Shafici madhhabs (schools of jurisprudence), two of the four law schools of Sunni Islam.27 Factional rivalry between these various sectarian traditions was intense, and contemporary polemical exchanges, con- ducted within the frame of heresy, unbelief, and sedition, sometimes degenerated into violent civil strife and even architectural desecration in the cities of eastern Iran dur- ing the eleventh and twelfth centuries.28 Recent scholarship has drawn attention to the survival of several Karrami texts, rang- ing from works on flqh (jurisprudence) and qisas (prophetic stories) to a Quťan com- mentary.29 As Josef van Ess notes, the dis- covery of these materials suggests that the Karramiya left more traces on the historical record than formerly thought.30 But because studies of the sect have been mainly the preserve of textual historians, the question of the survival of material artifacts, includ- ing manuscripts (as opposed to their textual contents), associated with the Karramiya has not been addressed. There can be little doubt, however, that Ghurid patronage of the Karramiya informed contemporary artis- tic production, for we are told that Sultan Ghiyath al-Din founded madrasas and khan- qahs for the Karramiya and other groups and provided them with waqfs (endowment deeds) and Quťans.31 Here I would like to suggest that at least one extant Qur'an man- uscript and several key Ghurid monuments, including the minaret of Jam, constitute 96 FLOOD</page><page sequence="8">Karrami documents even if they have not been recognized as such. The importance of the royal Quťan man- uscript mentioned above lies not only in the evidence that it offers for the develop- ment of Ghurid titulature, or in its unique status as the sole surviving object that can be securely ascribed to Ghurid patronage, but also in its astonishingly high production values (figs. 5~9).32 The four-volume Quťan is a superlative example of the arts of bind- ing, calligraphy, and illumination, composed of good-quality, large burnished sheets of paper (with a page size of about thirty-nine 5 .

The manuscript is also unusual in a num- ber of other respects, not least the amount of information it provides regarding its own production. This is contained in an extensive colophon (containing the titles cited earlier), which gives a date of 8 Rabi5 II 584/6 June 1189 for completion of the manuscript. It took five years to complete, and the text was copied by Muhammad ibn cIsa ibn Muhammad ibn cAli al-Nishaburi al-Laythi. The nisba (toponymie) of the scribe sug- gests that he or his family hailed from Nisha- pur, one of the four great cities of the eastern Iranian province of Khurasan. Nishapur was evidently a major artistic center at this period, for the architect responsible for the construction of the Jam minaret also seems to have hailed from that city.34 The calligraphy combines a variety of angular and cursive scripts (including naskh , thulth, and New Style), a combination that also characterizes the monumental epigraphy in Ghurid monuments at Herat and Shah-i Mashhad (see fig. 1 1 ).35 It is unlikely that the calligrapher was also the illuminator, as was sometimes the case, for the spectacular illu- mination and marginal ornaments (which show formal links to contemporary archi- tectural decoration) appear to be the work of several hands. The Ghurid Quťan is perhaps the most spectacular Quťan manuscript to have sur- vived from pre-Mongol Iran and will be the subject of a separate study, but here I want to call attention to a number of its idiosyn- crasies that shed light on the religious life of the Ghurid elite. The first of these concerns is its form: unusually for Quťans of this period, which tend to be single volumes or else divided into thirty, seven, or, more rarely, six or two volumes,36 the manuscript is divided into four volumes, each bearing some or all of its original tooled leather 98 FLOOD</page><page sequence="10">8.

The presence of an interlinear Per- sian translation of the sacred Arabic text is not unique (although this must be among the earliest dated occurrences), but the inclu- sion of a Quťanic commentary (tafsir) at the end of each chapter is of considerable interest and highly unusual for the period. The tafsir is a known one; in fact it is one of the texts recently identified as a Karrami document, written by Abu Bakr cAtiq ibn Muhammad al-Surabadi (d. c. 495/1 101), a leader of the Karramiya of Nishapur.37 The popularity of al-Surabadi's tafsir in twelfth- century Khurasan is evident from the fact that two earlier copies, dated 523/1129 and 5 3 5/1 1 40-1, survive.38 Both the manuscript and the exegetical text that it contains have multiple associa- tions with the western fringes of the areas under Ghurid control. The author of the tafsir, al-Surabadi, had close biographical associations with the areas of Khurasan later controlled by the Ghurids: while he lived in Nishapur, according to some authorities, he bore the nisba al-Harawi, suggesting connections with Herat.39 The post-Ghurid history of the manuscript itself is also closely connected with the border region between Iran and Afghanistan, for in 654/1256, just decades after the demise of the Ghurids, the Quťan was presented to the shrine of Shaykh Ahmad b. Abul-Hasan (d. 536/1141) at Turbat-i Shaykh Jam (now an Iranian border town to the west of Herat), a place with which al-Surabadi himself had been associated.40 The date of the Quťan places it firmly within the period when Ghiyath al-Din sup- ported the Karramiya of Ghur,41 and its inclusion of a Karrami tafsir raises the pos- sibility that the manuscript was among those commissioned by Ghiyath al-Din for a Kar- rami institution. The structure of the Ghurid Quťan suggests that a particular value was ascribed to al-Surabadťs tafsir, for while its four- volume form is unusual for a Khurasani Quťan of this period, contemporary taf asir (exegetical texts) were sometimes produced in four volumes, raising the possibility that the presence of the exegetical text may have determined the unusual structure of the Quťan itself. Although the place of pro- duction is not specified, Herat is a likely contender. In the second half of the twelfth century, an important metalwork school was centered in the city, and Herat's Friday Mosque was rebuilt in 597/1200, during a period when stylistic and epigraphic evi- dence attests the participation of its denizens in Ghurid architectural projects as far away as the Indus Valley and north India. The importance of the manuscript can hardly be overstated. As a unique royal man- uscript, it fills a major lacuna in the history of the material Quťan between the intro- duction of paper and cursive scripts in the early eleventh century and the celebrated flood 99</page><page sequence="11">"royal" Mamluk and Ilkhanid Quťans of the fourteenth.42 Equally important is its ability to illuminate the complex religious life of twelfth-century Ghur and its rela- tionship to artistic patronage. In this respect, the manuscript can help shed light on the epi- graphic program of the Jam minaret, as we shall see. Several studies of the minaret at Jam (see fig. 2) have in fact raised the possibility of a Karrami connection but have been ham- pered in their pursuit of this idea by a rela- tive dearth of information on the sect.43 In addition to the Karrami documents brought to life recently, however, basic details of Karrami beliefs are contained in medieval Arabic heresiographies. Combining these with a recent careful reconstruction of the spatial relations of the epigraphic bands on the minaret, it is, I believe, possible to demonstrate an association with the sect. In order to do so, we first have to broach the rather arcane world of Karrami kalam (spec- ulative theology) and the issue of anthropo- morphism in particular. Among the most theologically problematic verses in the Quťan are those that seem to imply the divine possession of corporeal attributes and qualities, apparently contra- dicting or undermining the notion of an eternal and uncreated deity that was central to Islamic thought.44 The opponents of the Karramiya depict them as taking a particu- larly literalist or anthropomorphist approach to these questions, with the result that they were sometimes known as mujassima, those who ascribe jism (body) to God.45 One of the key problems was whether (and which) divine attributes were extrinsic or intrinsic to God's essence. In light of these anthro- pomorphizing verses, divine speech was one of the attributes aggressively contested by various sects. The issue was central not only to the question of God's nature but also to the ontological status of the Quťan itself as the textualized trace of a speech act. At one extreme of the argument stood the Muctazilite opponents of the Karramiya, who asserted that the Quťan consisted of words and sounds and therefore was not eternal but originated in space and time. At the other end of the spectrum were those scholars of the orthodox Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence who argued that the sounds, the words, and even the material fabric of the Quťan were eternal and endur- ing.46 The Ashcari theological tradition that was closely associated with the Shafici law school sought to mediate between the two poles, distinguishing between the meaning of God's words, which constituted a kind of internal speech ( kalam nafsi) - part of his divine essence and therefore eternal - and revealed commands, promises, and threats spoken by prophets, iterated in stories about them, or transmitted in revealed books, all of which are created expressions of his eter- nal word.47 The Karramiya also steered a middle course between extremes, judging from the account of their beliefs in the book of Muslim sects and divisions written by Muhammad ibnc Abd al-Karim al-Shahrastani (d. 548/ 1 1 5 3 ), a resident of Khurasan who had first- hand experience of them: They hold that there are many incidents (. hawãdith ) in God's essence; such as, for example, information about past or future events, the books revealed to the prophets (peace be upon them), stories, the Promise and the Threat, and commands. In this category also are acts of hearing and seeing in regard to things audible and visible. Bringing into being and annihilation consist of God's Word and Will; for example, his saying "Be" [kun) to the thing that He wills to be and His willing the existence of that thing. . . . Muhammad ibn al-Haysam [Karrami theologian d. c. 409/1019] explained bringing into being and annihilation as Will and Choice, this being connected with His Word by the testimony of the Quťan: "To anything which We have willed, We but say to it 'Be7 and it is [kun fayakûn )" [Quťan 16:40]; or, again, "Verily, when He wills a thing, His command to it is 'Be/ and it is [kun fayakûn )" [Quťan 36:82]. 48 In their attempt to distinguish between eternal attributes and temporal acts, the Karramiya differentiated between attributes of essence (such as power and knowledge) and attributes of acts (such as creation). Although God has eternal power to act, acts them- selves are contingent and temporal incidents [hawãdith] facilitated by his power,- every originated thing and every temporal event is created and annihilated by the incidents that arise in Goďs eternal essence.49 The here- siography of Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (d. 429/ 100 FLOOD</page><page sequence="12">1037) puts the matter succinctly: "Ibn Kar- ram and his adherents hold that the Object of their Worship is a subject in which created entities exist. They believe that His utter- ances, His will, His visual and auditory per- ceptions, His contiguity to the uppermost surface of the Universe, are all accidents originated in Him and He is the place for these creations which originated in Him. 7/50 Crucially, however, and most controver- sially for the opponents of the Karramiya, God's power extends only over those things that originate in his essence.51 These created things and temporal events are called into being not through power, which is intrinsic to the divine essence, but through the divine command kun (Be!). On this point, al- Shahrastani again quotes the well-known Karrami theologian Muhammad ibn al- Haysam (d. c. 1019): "At the time He creates, He wills whatever He creates with a con- tingent will ( irada hãditha)-, and to everything that comes into being by His command He says 'Be!7 [kun) and it becomes.7752 God7s power to speak and his utterances (including the divine command Be , by means of which creation is effected) are temporally and ontologically distinct phenomena.53 The former is eternal; the latter is originated (but as a reflection of power, which is an eternal and enduring attribute) and composed of phe- nomena such as the words of the Quťan and those revealed in commands, promises, prophetic stories, and warnings. The Quťanic phrase kun fayakûn (Be! And it is.) occupied a central position in Karrami polemics on the relationship between divine nature and the created universe. The phrase occurs eight times in the Quťan, including in verse 3 5 of the Surat Maryam.54 This verse falls at a key point in the decorative scheme of the Jam minaret, offering tangible support for the suggestion of a Karrami connection. In her recent study, Sourdel-Thomine detected an axial hierarchy to the decorative scheme of the lowest shaft of the minaret. She noted that all the inscriptions on the minaret terminate on its western face (fig. 10, face 8) and demonstrated that the eastern and western faces of the minaret (fig. 10, faces 4 and 8) constitute the fulcrums around which the entire decorative program is articulated.55 The observation is of considerable impor- tance, for it suggests that the Karramiya shared the conventional designation of a westerly qibla (Mecca orientation) with their Hanafi contemporaries in Afghanistan and Central Asia. That common ground should exist between the two on such a funda- mental matter is perhaps not surprising, in view of reports that the citizenry of Ghur adhered to Karrami doctrines in matters of religion (din) and Hanafi precepts in matters of law (fiqh).56 The eastern section (face 4), which a viewer would have faced while oriented toward a westerly qibla, is further distin- guished by the presence of an arched panel resembling a mihi ab (a directional indicator of prayer) surmounted by a knotted rhom- boidal pattern that is unique among the geo- metric panels of the minaret. It is precisely here, at what is clearly the visual and icono- graphie fulcrum of the minaret (what Barthes might have identified as its punctum), that verse 35 falls. There is no numerical logic for this positioning. The verse is not the mid- point of the chapter but the thirty-fifth verse in a series of ninety-eight; considerable care was thus taken to ensure that it fell pre- cisely within the unique forms on the east- ern facade. The verses that begin within the bands of the knot (fig. 10: face 4, between I and J above panel 3 ), then run down the left- hand frame of the arched panel below and the right side of the star beneath, read as follows: This was Jesus, son of Mary: A true account they contend about. (34) It does not behoove God to have a son. Too immaculate is He! When He decrees a thing He has only to say: "Be," and it is ( kun fayakûn). (35) The chapter then continues: [Jesus only said:] " Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path." (36) Yet the sectarians differed among themselves. Alas for the unbelievers when they see the Terrible Day! (37) The same verses appeared in the interior of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem (72/ 692) almost five centuries earlier.57 There, the emphasis on the mortality of Jesus had a literal relevance, revisiting a locus classi- cus of doctrinal difference between Islam flood 101</page><page sequence="13">and the Christian majority of the city (Mus- lims believe in the prophecy of Jesus but not in his divinity).58 There is little evi- dence, however, for a Christian population in medieval Ghur, and it seems unlikely that the entire epigraphic program of the Jam minaret was designed to address the tiny community of Jews known to have existed there.59 In an analysis of the way in which mod- ern preachers deploy specific Quťanic verses, Richard Antoun has argued that to consider Quťanic verses divorced from their "spa- tial, social and diachronic contexts" is to confer upon them "a false semantic con- tent."60 This is especially true of Quťanic texts inscribed on monumental architec- ture, each of which constitutes "an inter- pretive moment given permanence," a reflection of the particular valences acquired by sacred scripture in specific historical con- texts.61 To read the verses inscribed on the minaret of Jam as a literal address to Chris- tians and Jews is to indulge a literalism, an assumption of transparency, that ignores the complex nuances and resonances that specific verses acquired not only within con- temporary (and sometimes contrary) exeget- ical traditions, but also within kalam and the polemical exchanges of medieval theolo- gians and jurists.62 As studies of Quťanic recitation have reminded us, scripture is not reducible to a physically or conceptually static artifact but is rather constituted by sacred text "in its relationship to persons and communities of faith."63 Rather than an address to some nebulous monotheist or polytheist other, then, the central epigraphic program of the minaret should be understood as a bold address to the fractious monotheist self. At the heart of the decorative scheme, in the focal inscrip- tion of the minaret, appears a distillation of the themes of prophecy, revelation, promise, and warning central to Karrami belief. The same themes are reiterated at regular inter- vals throughout the Surat Maryam, which invokes a dazzling array of ancestors and prophets, including Aaron, Adam, Abraham, Idris (Ezra), Isaac, Ismacil, Jacob, John, Jesus, Moses, Noah, and Zachariah. Indeed, it is hard to think of another Quťanic chapter in which such a vast array of prophets appears.64 The theme of the revealed book is also repeatedly emphasized, often in conjunc- tion with the commemoration of these saintly figures, and dire warnings are vis- ited on those who deny the unity of God or disbelieve in him. The care taken to position verse 3 5 pro- vides the clinching argument, for it evi- dently reflects the centrality of the Quťanic phrase kun fayakün in kalam concerning the complex relationship between divine will and word, power and creation. While the occurrences of the phrase kun fayakün in the Quťan all appear amid elucidations of God's creative abilities, the linkage between the person of Jesus and the creative power of the divine command kun throws these issues into high relief, as the Virgin Birth (in which Muslims believe, and which is alluded to in verse 20 of the Surat Maryam) offers one of the ultimate proofs of God's ability to call into being with his command kun.65 However, the highlighted verses also reject Christian belief in Jesus' divinity, which contradicts the notion of tawhid, the oneness of God, that is central to Islamic thought. Indeed, four of the eight Quťanic occur- rences of the phrase kun fayakün (including that in the Surat Maryam) relate specifically to the creation and nature of Jesus, asserting his mortal character despite the unusual cir- cumstances of his conception, and denying his divinity.66 The Quťanic commentary of al-Surabadi constitutes a key document for 10.

In his exegesis of Quťan 19:35, al-Surabadi links the phrase kun fayakùn with the creative power of God, while emphasizing that the verse contains a rebuttal to those who assert that Jesus was his son.67 Rather than mak- ing a transparent allusion to a hypothetical Christian community, this emphasis on the mortality of Christ in the Quťanic verses highlighted on the Jam minaret is likely to reflect contemporary criticisms that certain of the anthropomorphist views of the Karramiya had a Christian origin. Such criticisms are found in the work of scholars such as Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1037) and Abu'l-Muzaffar al-Isfara3ini (d. 471/1078). 68 Considered within the frame of Karrami theology (as far as we can reconstruct it), Quťan 19:34-35 addresses the relationship between God's eternal essence and his tem- poral creative powers, while underlining that the latter did not extend to the pro- duction of divine progeny. If the choice of the Surat Maryam reveals the entire program of the minaret as a doctrinal exposition of Karrami theology, the focal verse highlights the issue of anthropomorphism, establishing its appropriate limits in a manner that serves as a rebuttal to the critics of the Karramiya. The discursive deployment of Quťanic cita- tion on the minaret thus reflects the ability of the timeless text to acquire particular valences that inflect its deployment in his- torically specific contexts. Assuming (as seems likely) that the verses were chosen for their ability to reflect contemporary con- cerns, the polytheists and unbelievers referred to in the Surat Maryam are more likely to refer to the Ghuzz Turks, or the Muslim opponents of the Karramiya, who depicted the Karramiya in turn as heretics and spreaders of sedition,69 than the far-distant Hindus. Seen in this light, the minaret represents a remarkably sophisticated synthesis of archi- tectural form, decorative elaboration, and epigraphic content that opens a unique win- dow onto the complex entanglements of architectural patronage, dynastic aspirations, legal proscriptions, and theological dispu- tations in the turbulent marches of the east- ern Islamic world. Construction of the minaret was not a heuristic enterprise but one that reflects a great deal of planning and probably active collaboration between arti- san, khatib (preacher), or qadi (judge), and patron.70 However deliberate the choice and positioning of the Quťanic verses on the lower shaft of the minaret may have been, their legibility (and hence their utility as discursive statements) was somewhat cir- cumscribed by their elevated placement, scale, and use of a fancy script.71 The need for modern photographic technology to read many of them suggests that their presence was intended as a " symbolic affirmation" of Karrami doctrines to be apprehended monop- tically rather than painstakingly deci- phered.72 This being so, the minaret may have been intended to provide a focal mon- ument for the Karrami self as much as to convey a message to its Shaflci or Hanafi opponents, the epigraphic content and mean- ing of the monument being known to a learned few and susceptible of oral trans- mission to those not cognizant with the arcane theological milieu and abstruse doc- trinal disputes that informed both.73 There is no reason to assume that these meanings were perpetuated much beyond the genera- tion following the minaret's construction,- the "short charge" of epigraphic semiosis in Islamic architecture, the ability for the inter- pretive moment to be subsumed in the diachronic reception of the monument, has been noted elsewhere.74 In any case, the pietistic inclinations of the Shansabanid sultans were soon to shift away from the Karramiya, as we shall see shortly. The evidence identifying the preeminent architectural monument of the Ghurid sul- tans as a Karrami document suggests the possibility that other known Ghurid mon- uments might also have been constructed for the sect. Although none of the madrasas that Ghiyath al-Din built for the Karramiya is known to survive, it is possible that the fragmentary and richly decorated madrasa at Shah-i Mashhad in Gharjistan, dated 571/ 1176 (fig. 11), was dedicated for their use. Gharjistan, like Ghur, had historical con- nections with the Karramiya, for it was among the areas in which Abu cAbd Allah flood 103</page><page sequence="15">1 1 . Shah-i Mashhad madrasa, Gharjistan, 571/1176, general view from the south Photograph courtesy of Bernt Glatzer Muhammad ibn Karram, the founder of the sect, had preached during his lifetime.75 To judge from the decorations of the Jam minaret, the Karramiya adopted a conven- tional westward qibla orientation, like their contemporaries in the orthodox Hanafi madhhab. The fragmentary state of the Shah-i Mashhad madrasa makes its qibla orientation difficult to determine, but sug- gestions that it was occidented leave open the possibility that it was among those con- structed for the sect by the Ghurid elite.76 If the identities and personalities of the religious scholars of Firuzkuh who may have shaped the epigraphic program of the Jam minaret are elusive, medieval texts and inscriptions are a little more forthcoming on the architectural patronage of the Ghurid elite. The foundation text of the Shah-i Mash- had madrasa, for example, refers to its female patron as "the great wise queen" ( malika al- mu'azzam al-'alima3), and it has been sug- gested that the lady in question was Malika Taj al-Harir Jawhar Malik, the wife of sul- tan Ghiyath al-Din.77 Given that the wife of the Seljuq sultan Sanjar had restored the royal caravanserai at Ribat-i Sharaf in eastern Iran in 549/1145, this is by no means implausible.78 Little is known about Ghiyath al-Din's queen, however, and two prominent Ghurid royal women known to have acted as architectural patrons are more plausible candidates. The first is Malika-i Hajji, the mother of Ziya3 al-Din, sultan Ghiyath al-Din's cousin and son-in-law, who held the appanage of Nishapur and eventu- ally succeeded Ghiyath al-Din as sultan at Firuzkuh.79 Malika-i Hajji had made the pil- grimage to Mecca with her son, founded a khanqah in the holy city, and is reported to have founded mosques, pulpits, and reli- gious schools in the Ghurid territories.80 An alternative patron for the Shah-i Mash- had madrasa would be Mah Malik or Malika 104 FLOOD</page><page sequence="16">al-Jalali, Sultan Ghiyath al-Diiťs daughter, the wife of Ziya3 al-Din and a woman famed for her religious learning and piety.81 The bestowal of a robe of honor (an honorific device often associated with the conferral of political authority) on Mah Malik by her uncle, Sultan Mucizz al-Din, suggests that she was a figure of some importance, an impres- sion reinforced by a recent report that ille- gal excavations in the vicinity of the Jam minaret had uncovered a foundation text bearing her name.82 Her husband, Ziya5 al- Din, was one of the most fervent supporters of the Karramiya in Firuzkuh, representing their interests in the turbulent events of 595/1199, to which I now turn briefly in conclusion. Orthodoxy The association between the Shansabanids and the Karramiya was not an enduring one. In 595/1199, the Ghurid sultans abruptly ended their patronage of the sect, with its regional and rather backwoods associations, and embraced instead the orthodox (and more transregional) Hanafi and Shafici law schools of Sunni Islam. Whereas Ghiyath al-Din became a Shafici, building Shafici madrasas and a mosque at Ghazna, Mucizz al-Din became a Hanafi, embracing what was in effect the preeminent madhhab among the population of Ghazna.83 The historian Minhaj al-Din Juzjani, who was raised at the Ghurid court in Firuzkuh, attributes this dramatic shift in Ghurid piety and patronage to a dream in which the epony- mous founder of the Shafici school of jurispru- dence appeared to the sultan.84 According to Ibn al-Athir (d. 630/1233), however, the sul- tan's conversion was occasioned through the mediation of the Shafici faqih (jurispru- dent) Shaykh Wajih al-Din al-Marvarudhi, invited to Firuzkuh by the court poet Fakhr al-Din Mubarakshah who had realized the errors in Karramiya doctrine.85 The notion of a reinvention of the royal persona result- ing from the agency of a single individual (whether visionary or incarnate) is suspect, but the idea of mediation by individuals with strong connections to a wider Islamic world is quite plausible. In 594/1198, just a year before these events, the cAbbasid caliph al-Nasir (d. 622/1225) had dispatched the famous Shafici faqih Yahya ibn Rabť, of the celebrated Nizamiyya School in Baghdad, to Ghur. There he reportedly remained for four years, strengthening the ties between Baghdad and the Ghurid sultanate.86 The timing is suggestive, as is the concentrated presence of other major Shafici thinkers and Sufi preachers in Firuzkuh at this time.87 These shifts in pietistic affiliations were not without consequences. On the contrary, we are told that the feelings of the inhabi- tants of Ghur were sufficiently inflamed that a fltna cazima, or great civil disturbance, broke out in Firuzkuh.88 The disturbances were not confined to Ghur, where the Kar- ramiya and their supporters were a majority. The Karrami imam of a madrasa at Afshin in Gharjistan, an area with historical links to Ibn Karram, penned a series of polemical verses criticizing Sultan Ghiyath al-Din, which were sufficiently inflammatory to earn the writer a year's exile to Nishapur.89 Civil strife between the Karramiya and their opponents was common during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the violent events of 595/ii99in Firuzkuh were foreshadowed by a number of earlier disturbances in east- ern Iranian cities, including Bayhaq (Sabze- var), Herat, and Nishapur. The role of archi- tectural desecration and destruction in these disturbances provides a striking reminder of how heterogeneous and potentially frac- tious the Muslim self could be.90 However unpopular at home, the events of 595/1199 coincide with the emergence of the Ghurid sultans as major players on the world stage, the result of rapid territorial expansion westward into Khurasan and east- ward into north India. Occurring just seven years after the conquest of major north Indian cities such as Delhi (a point to which I return), the development reflects the chang- ing nature of the Ghurid sultanate. I suggest above that the titulature of the Ghurid sul- tans hints at a capacity for reinventing the self (or at least its "official" manifestations) in tandem with the shifting fortunes of the sultanate. This capacity for self-fashioning was already apparent to medieval observers, for Ibn al-Athir observes that when the Ghurid sultans became rulers of Khurasan (that is, of the wider Iranian world), they learned that the Karramiya were considered theologically unsophisticated and therefore flood 105</page><page sequence="17">decided to alter their doctrinal allegiances and embrace Shaficism.91 Among the events of 595 /1199 was a con- certed attack mounted by the Karramiya on the celebrated Shafici theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, another thinker who came to preach in Firuzlcuh and Ghazna at the invitation of Sultan Ghiyath al-Din and later served as an envoy to India.92 In his speech from the minbar (pulpit) of the Great Mosque of Firuzlcuh opposing al-Razi, the leader of the Firuzkuh Karramis, Ibn al-Qudwa, who belonged to the Haysamiyya subsect of the Karramiya, denounced the faqih as espous- ing the unbelief of Ibn Sina, and the philos- ophy of al-Farabi, two of the great thinkers of the wider Sunni world whose work Fakhr al-Din al-Razi had studied and commented on.93 As a religious faction with strong regional ties, the Karramiya were evidently opposed to the sorts of theological cos- mopolitanism that the Shañcis and Sufis rep- resented. The timing of the switch to a more transregional form of Sunni Islam suggests that it was this very cosmopolitanism that rendered the orthodox schools of jurispru- dence attractive to the Ghurid sultans.94 Although it has escaped notice, the theo- logical volte-face of 595/1199 was also reflected in significant alterations to the "official" self-representations of Ghurid sultans and the media that bore them. In 5 96/1200, one year after the Firuzkuh riots, major changes were instituted to Ghurid gold and silver coinage. Before 595/1199, in addition to the ubiquitous "bull and horse- man" coin type of northwest India, Ghurid mints had also issued coins of traditional epi- graphic type, consisting of a central field with superimposed horizontal lines of script and a circular marginal legend (fig. 12). 95 From 596/1200 onward, however, these were supplemented by two new coin types, intro- duced in a variety of weight standards as both gold dinars and silver dirhams: one bore a distinctive concentric-circle (or "bull's- eye") motif, the other a square-in-circle design (figs. 13 and 14). Both types had originated in the Fatimid and Almohad polities of North Africa during the tenth and twelfth centuries, respectively, and had thence been adopted by the Sunni rulers of the eastern Mediterranean.96 The introduction of these new coin types thus 12.

It is even possible that the contem- porary Ayyubid sultanate of Syria, which had adopted these coin types a few decades earlier, provided the specific models for the new coinage (figs. 15 and 16).97 The fame of the Ayyubid sultan Salah al-Din (known to Western sources as Saladin) was then at its zenith. Having ended the rule of the Fatimid caliphs in Egypt in 567/1171 (thus bringing the eastern Mediterranean back into the Sunni fold), Salah al-Din recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 582/1187. Minhaj-i Siraj Juzjani, who was raised at the Ghurid court in Firuzkuh, explicitly com- pares the military victories of Salah al-Din against the Ismacili Fatimids and Christian Franks in the West with those of the Ghurid sultan Mucizz al-Din against the Ghaznavid and Hindu kingdoms of northern India in the East during the same period.98 The Ayyu- bids also championed the cause of the Shafi'i madhhab, promoting themselves as up- holders of Sunni orthodoxy and employing Quťanic inscriptions to this end.99 The internationalist turn in the Ghurid polity was indicated not only by the conno- tative value of the coins but also by their denotative content. It is on these newly introduced Ghurid coin types that Quťanic quotations appear, apparently for the very first time. On both types the quotation con- sists of Quťan 9:33, a relatively common numismatic inscription that had appeared on the Afghan coin issues of the Ghaznavid and Samanid predecessors of the Ghurids: "It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it supe- rior to other systems of belief, even though the polytheists may not like it. 7/1 00 The prolific gold and silver issues minted in Ghazna from 590/1194 onward probably reflect an influx of Indian gold after a major victory in India two years earlier,101 and it is tempting to relate the presence of this verse to those contemporary Indian cam- paigns. However, this Quťanic assertion of orthodoxy is intimately associated with the minting of new "international" coin types that follows hard on the heels of the Ghurids7 radical shift away from the Karramiya in 595/1199 and to which it is likely to be related. Rhetorical accusations of heresy and 1 5 . Ayyubid dinar struck in Cairo in the name of Salah al-Din in 571/1175-6, obverse University of Pennsylvania Museum, 1002.1.1028 16.

Alterations to the form and epigraphic content of Iranian coins have been corre- lated with the conversion of the Ilkhanid sultan Uljaytu from Shťism to Sunnism in 7 09/1308, an event that sparked riots remi- niscent of those that followed the Ghurids' abandonment of the Karramiya a century earlier.105 In the later case, however, the numismatic changes reflect shifting pat- terns of royal patronage and resulting alter- ations to the power balance between rival Sunni groups. The numismatic dissemina- tion of a Quťanic quotation, one chosen for its ability to promote the position of a par- ticular Sunni faction, finds more germane precedents in the eastern Iranian coin issues of the Ghaznavid and Seljuq sultans whom the Ghurids succeeded.106 Medieval Heterodoxies and Modern Orthodoxies The shifting pietistic inclinations of the Ghurid sultans call into question any notion of a unitary Muslim self, even among elite strata of medieval societies, while the epi- graphic program of the Jam minaret offers a very concrete paradigm for understanding the ways in which intra-Muslim doctrinal disputes inflected elite material culture. Per- haps more significant, it illustrates how a failure to interrogate the adjective Muslim or Islamic can obscure or relegate such inflec- tions in favor of more essentializing inter- pretations. This point has ramifications well beyond the often arcane worlds of medieval theology and modern art history. In traditional historiography (and art his- toriography), it has been taken as axiomatic that Ghurid expansion into north India in the 1 1 90s constituted a "Muslim" or "Islamic" conquest (in fact the Islamic conquest) of India, in which a reified Muslim self defeated a hypostatized Hindu other largely con- structed in opposition to it. The material instantiations of the medieval past, chief among them the mosques erected in north India in the wake of the Ghurid conquest, have served to validate this reading. These mosques, among them well-known monu- ments such as the Qutb Minar (1 199 onward) and its associated mosque in Delhi (1192 onward), were largely constructed from spo- lia taken from temples and other structures, and their reception in colonial and post- colonial scholarship has been characterized by the Manichaean division between "Hindu" and "Muslim" traditions that pervades much writing on the period. Despite its geographic and art historical obscurity, the Ghurid sul- tanate thus occupies center stage in modern polemical and rhetorical representations of medieval South Asian history and their reflec- tions in contemporary Indian politics.107 For medieval observers who wrote about their experience of the Qutb Mosque in Delhi, the most celebrated of the Indo- Ghurid mosques, the extraordinary ubiq- uity of Quťanic inscriptions covering the facade of the prayer hall and the adjoining minaret (figs. 17-20) left a far greater impres- sion than the recycled architectural materi- als. The proliferation of epigraphy in this and other Indo-Ghurid mosques follows a tra- dition established in the Ghurid monuments of eastern Iran, Afghanistan, and the Indus Valley, which have been compared to "huge billboards proclaiming various messages at those who enter them."108 As we have seen, the programmatic nature of the Quťanic inscriptions on Ghurid monuments can hardly be doubted (even if they are imper- fectly understood), suggesting that what was exported to India in the last decade of the twelfth century was not only a penchant for monumental epigraphy but also an estab- lished tradition of employing Quťanic quo- tations discursively.109 Studies of the Quťanic inscriptions in the Indo-Ghurid mosques have highlighted their emphasis on idolatry and unbelief, assuming that their content constitutes them as discursive statements addressed to the conquered Hindu population in some un- examined sense. As with the minaret of Jam, a rhetorical emphasis on infidelity in the inscriptions of these mosques has been among the factors that have constituted them as symbols of "Muslim" victory, contribut- ing to a modern polemic of the medieval. Construction of Indo-Ghurid mosques like the Qutb Mosque straddled the period of sec- IO8 FLOOD</page><page sequence="20">17- Qutb Mosque, Delhi, 1 192 onward, arched screen forming facade of prayer hall, 594/1198 Author photograph 18.

Just as architectural patron- age had been integral to the Ghurids' pro- motion and support of the Karramiya, the patronage of monumental architecture also served to signify the realignment of the Ghurid polity after 595/1199. In 597/1201, for example, when a fire provided Sultan Ghiyath al-Din with the opportunity to undertake a major renovation or rebuilding of the Great Mosque of Herat (funded at least in part by Indian booty), the imamate of the mosque was bestowed on the Shaficis in perpetuity.110 The instrumentality of both architecture and epigraphy to the internecine disputes between different Sunni factions is integral to understanding the architectural patronage of the Ghurid sultans and their Turkic gen- erals in north India. Although it was the product of territorial expansion, construction of the Indian mosques should also be under- stood as part of an extended program of Ghurid architectural patronage in the last decade of the sixth/twelfth century. Based on the evidence from contemporary Afghanistan, it seems likely that the multiple references to error, falsity, and unbelief in their Quťanic inscriptions constituted an address to audi- ences that may have included the Hindu unbeliever but also addressed the heteroge- neous Muslim population.111 The question flood 109</page><page sequence="21">of religious identity is further complicated by the existence of communities of Mus- lims of various sorts in north Indian cities before the conquest, communities that included Muslims who did not necessarily share the confessional affinities of the Ghurids or their Turkic soldiery.112 Doctri- nal schisms and their correlates in archi- tectural violence continued to be part of the cultural life of the Muslim communities of north India even after the conquest, follow- ing a pattern familiar from eastern Iran and Afghanistan in the preceding two centuries. In 634/1236, for example, riots broke out at the Qutb Mosque in Delhi, reportedly involv- ing Ismacilis and Shťis.113 The connection between campaigns against heresy and rhetoric about it in con- temporary manuals on statecraft, a linkage reflected in the titles of the Ghurid sultans, is central to understanding the discursive function of the Quťanic citations in Ghurid architecture as a whole, not just those in north Indian mosques. The eastward expan- sion of the Ghurid sultanate began with a successful campaign against the Isma'ili Shťis of Multan and Sind by Mucizz al-Din in 569/1174 and effectively ended with his murder by one of their number in 603/ 1206. 114 The rise and fall of the Ghurid sul- tanate is thus circumscribed by questions of orthodoxy, heterodoxy (or even heresy), and self-definitions made in relation to the rhetor- ical claims of both. The last decade of the sixth/twelfth century is particularly marked by convulsive sectarian disputes and shift- ing patterns of religious patronage in the Ghurid heartlands. Contemporary as they are with Ghurid expansion into north India, these shifts undermine the notion of a sin- gular and stable self, defined through religious affinity. They also provide a context for understanding contemporary architectural patronage that is at once more nuanced and historicizing than the generic tropes of "Mus- lim" victory or "Hindu-Muslim" antipathy. Returning to the terminological problem with which I began, it might be argued that the use of the qualifying adjectives Islamic or Muslim by historians of medieval art and architecture has produced a coherence effect that both assumes and produces the umma, the Muslim community, as a homogeneous or monolithic entity. Despite their undoubted 19. Qutb Minar, Delhi, 1199 onward, general view Author photograph IIO FLOOD</page><page sequence="22">20. Qutb Minar, Delhi, 1199 onward, detail of inscription Author photograph convenience, the use of these terms obscures the fact that, at any given moment, the Mus- lim self was never an entirely unitary or static entity, but rather comprised multiple complementary or competing selves con- stituted dynamically and relationally in response to shifting cultural, historical, and political conditions. The evidence from the remote mountain valleys of Afghanistan suggests that these alternative selves can be intrinsic to an understanding of pre- modern artistic production, highlighting the need for future research rooted in specific his- torical conditions rather than generic rhetor- ical representations. One final point concerns the interplay of text and artifact in synchronic deployments of Quťanic scripture. Studies of Quťanic inscriptions on medieval monuments have generally been undertaken using epigraphic compendia that ignore the materiality of monumental inscriptions, thereby privileg- ing textual content in a way that betrays the genealogical origins of Islamic art history in Oriental studies. Any hypothesis regard- ing the meaning of the minaret of Jam and its enigmatic epigraphic program, for example, must address both context and content, formal and textual aspects of the monument. Although one can agree whole- heartedly with Carole Hillenbrand's obser- vation that in the analysis of monumental Quťanic inscriptions, "the focus of schol- arship must shift from mere epigraphy to Quťanic studies/' one might therefore also emphasize the need for scholars of both reli- gious ideas and Quťanic epigraphy to engage with the materiality of their sources.115 FLOOD III</page><page sequence="23">NOTES This essay expands on a theme first articulated in Finbarr Barry Flood, review of Le Minaret Ghouride de Jam: Un chef d'oeuvre du Xlle siècle by Janine Sourdel-Thomine, Art Bulletin 87, no. 3 (September 2005): 536-543 and n. 202.

A series of silver coins issued from an unknown mint between 569/1173 and 581/1185 is exceptional in naming Mu'izz al-Din as sultán al-azam, hinting at divergences between the assumption and bestowal of royal authority: William F.

In the absence of diacritical marks (which were often omitted in medieval inscriptions), the words for seventy ( sabcin ) and ninety ( tiscïn ) in Arabic are virtually indistinguishable. Ralph Pinder-Wilson (2001, 169, figs. 22-24) has argued for a reading of 590/1 193-94, and this date has been cited in most lit- erature on the minaret. Using photographic material garnered in i960, however, Sourdel-Thomine (2004, 1 3 5- 1 39) reads the inscription as bi-ta3rlkh sana sabcïn wa khamsami'a (on the date of the year five hundred and seventy [117 4- 1 1 7 5 ] ) rather than tiscln wa khamsami'a (five hundred and ninety). Everything rests on the question of whether or not the hasta of the initial letter of the disputed word extends horizontally leftward at its terminal point, as Pinder-Wilson suggests in his text and accompanying drawing. This would identify it as the Arabic letter 112 FLOOD</page><page sequence="24">tã' rather than the first of the three hastae of the let- ter sin. Sourdel-Thomine argues that Pinder-Wilson has been misled by the decay of the horizontal brick frame above the inscription. Although she does not note them, several factors support her reading. First, where such horizontal extensions do occur in the inscriptions surrounding the dating panel, they are similar in thickness to the hastae , which is not the case here (hence the ambiguity). Second, the three initial strokes of the disputed word decrease in height as one reads from right to left; careful exami- nation of the three vertical strokes of the letter sin in the preceding word sana show the same characteris- tic (although it is not as pronounced), supporting a reading of sin rather than tã 1 6.

Miles, ed. Dickran K. Kouymjian (Beirut, 1974), 307-308. See also Welch, Keshani, and Bain 2002, 14. The orches- tration of the epigraphic program so that a key verse both describes and coincides with the nodal point of the decorative program hints at an early use of paper notation, documented only from the thirteenth cen- tury onward. 71. Note that the shahãda is set at the summit of the minaret, precluding easy legibility, yet this is arguably the most important of all the inscriptions, a basic affirmation of the core beliefs that unite the Muslim community, the umma. 72. This distinction and the idea of a monoptic per- ception (apprehension at a glance) is borrowed from Oleg Grabar, The Mediation of Ornament, Bollingen Series 38 (Princeton, 1992), 103. 73.

It is important here to bear in mind the centrality of the aural and oral trans- mission of the Quť an, to which the written text gen- erally functioned as a kind of aide-mémoire for those who already knew it by heart: Graham 1985, 34. 74. Ettinghausen 1974, 308; Edwards 2001, 65, 70. Both note the consequent tendency for awareness of the particular meanings of complex epigraphic pro- grams to be lost over time, as did Grabar in his foun- dational essay on the Dome of the Rock (1959, 60-61). 75.

Blair (1985, 90 n. 35) suggests that this may have been a Shafi'i foundation with a southerly orientation. With the principal entrance apparently sited on the south facade, this would pro- duce the very unsatisfactory arrangement of entering the building and then being compelled to double back to access the prayer chamber. 77.

In his study of the rivalry between the rival madhhabs of Nishapur, the epi- center of internecine strife during the period, Bulliet has argued that the madhhabs constituted not only schools of legal interpretation but also "political parties" united by "a vision of the right ordering of society," which were "vying for possession of key political posts within the city and ultimately for the city itself" (Bulliet 1972, 38-39). 91.

Titles emphasizing the role of the Shansabanid sultans as promoters of orthodoxy and extirpators of poly- theism are conspicuous by their absence from surviv- ing monumental inscriptions in India and anywhere else in their domains. Quťanic rather than historical inscriptions seem to have assumed a primary rhetori- cal function. 1 10. Muhammad ibn Khavandshah Mirkhvand, Rawdat al-safã3, 2 vols. (Tehran, 1996), 2:787.
