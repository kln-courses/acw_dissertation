<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Claim for an Enchanted Secularity Gilbert Mclnnis Levine, George. Darwin Loves You . Princeton: Princeton UP, 2006. CCCVI + 306 pages. In his most recent book-length study, Darwin Lopes You , George Levine pays little attention to fiction of the Victorian period, as he has in the past, or to Darwin's influence on literature of that period. Now he takes up the topic of how Darwin's life and work have shaped our culture. Moreover, it is a book written by a professor of English Literature who now feels he has to explain the ethical principles Darwin has lived by. One may even say that Darwin Loves You is an apologetic for a faith based in the nature philosophy of Darwin. In the "Preface," Levine shares with us how he came up with the title of the book; from this, we know implicitly what group the work is reacting to. The title of the book came to him when his son gave him a bumper sticker that read "Darwin Loves You," no doubt a parody, in Levine's words, on those "frightening" fundamentalists who are "undermining rapidly and violently the structures of democracy" (xiii). However much this sounds like the tone of Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion , Levine reassures us his book is not an attack on fundamentalism; rather, it is about a "morally enchanting vision" (xv), and he nicely builds an image of this vision in the chapters that follow. Likewise, he professes that a Darwinian world-view can provide "value and meaning" to our lives, and that, according to this "Darwinian Enchantment," we do not need to "reinstitute a teleology," nor accept the idea of "divine creation." It is all in "Nature," and we need only to read Darwin to experience this vision. Levine's evidence for enchantment also contradicts Max Weber's idea of disenchantment, which argues that, "rational scientific explanation inevitably expels meaning and value from the world" (xiv). Levine's book refutes Weber throughout, beginning in its Preface. Chapter One, "Secular Re-enchantment," sets the stage for the book's struggle against "Weberian meaninglessness" (37), and introduces the possibility of kinder "ethics" derived from Darwin's materialistic interpretation of nature. Moreover, the chapter attempts to make a distinction between sincere Darwinians and what we find out later to be the social Darwinists. A study of W. H. Mallock's If Ufe Worth Living ? (1879) is juxtaposed with more current studies, which have political agendas. One example is Stephen Pinker's Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies 14.1. 2008. Copyright Â© 2009 by HJEAS.

In response to Pinker's disenchantment, Levine draws from well-chosen passages of Darwin's The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1874). For example, "The wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed" (Levine 38). The author labors passionately to show how this "absolute perfection" is "a concession to a Paleyan vision." Levine develops this Darwinian vision throughout the book, especially imitating Darwin's rhetorical method of discourse, namely, Darwin's reliance on analogy and anthropomorphism, which move a "serious reader" of Darwin from the "is" to the "ought." Nature is that "absolute perfection." What I find fascinating in this chapter is Levine's consideration of Mary Midgley's conclusion that "[e]volution is the creation-myth of our age," and that it has "great symbolic power independent of its truth" (6). Chapters Two, Three, and Four form the body of Levine's vigorous disagreement with disenchantment. "Disenchanting Darwin" allows Levine to show his readers how some Darwinians today are falling into the trap of disenchantment. He warns "Disenchanting Darwinians" and makes the general reader aware of those who make Darwin "social" in order to push forward their own political agendas. The topic of social Darwinism (and especially the notion of reductdonism) is given much space here. Yet, Levine attempts to guide the youthful "Darwinian" to accept "[t]he trickiest aspect of Darwin studies" and "somehow to avoid, on the one hand, the tendency to separate out the science from the cultural in his thought . . ." (46). In Chapter Three, Levine explores works by Karl Pearson, Social Evolution (1894), and Benjamin Kidd, The Grammar of Science (1892). Levine informs us that Pearson's agenda was influenced gready by his political agenda of socialism, in contrast to Kidd's vision of a "liberal democracy." "Both Pearson and Kidd were anti-capitalist . . . , and yet both were imperialist in their understanding of the relation of the white European to nonwhite races" (78). An interesting issue taken up by Levine between Kidd and Pearson is how serious scientists can have different interpretations of Darwin's theory of natural selection. For example, the notions of "group selection" versus "individual" selection are examined in light of the material quoted by Levine from Darwin. Kidd needs "altruism in this competitive world and finds it not at the level of the individual" (80), but ironically at the group level. For Pearson, altruistic socialism depends on another level of struggle: extragroup struggle, yet "leaving a superior progeny" (89). Much of this chapter examines the works of Kidd at the expense of Pearson's work, probably because "Kidd imports teleology back into 172</page><page sequence="3">Darwinism," and according to Levine this "makes it more obviously compatible with enchantment" (84). In Chapter Four, "A Modern Use: Sociobiology," Levine returns to Stephen Pinker's work, but supplements this with an in-depth study on E. O. Wilson's two books Sociobiologjj (1975) and Consilience (1998). Chapter Four is perhaps the finest of all in showing how Weber would be infuriated with these social Darwinists, and how by their reductionism they are somewhat guilty of "biologizing everything human" (100). Included in this group are Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins, to no surprise. In my view, there are three attractive features about this chapter, beyond Levine's fine analysis of Wilson's work. First, how postmodernism, poststructuralism, or deconstruction are the enemies of Wilson (113). Second, the reader is introduced to reasons for "the radical failure of Comte's Positivist religion" (119). Finally, Levine describes how Darwinian science is not only rooted in the ideas of the Enlightenment, but has also sprouted from the ideals of the Romantic Movement. Chapter Five, "Darwin and Pain," leaves all other Darwinists aside and returns to the source of Levine's study on enchantment: Darwin the Romantic scientist. The chapter is divided into two parts, one dealing with Darwin's passionate interest in understanding nature, or his "romantic" sensibility, and the latter part that compassionately portrays Darwin's pain at the loss of his ten-year old daughter, Annie. Levine's remarkable talent is noticeable when he uses Darwin's personal loss to evoke empathy for a man we usually assume to be only an objective scientist, yet Levine warns us, "Darwin was no saint" (130). Instead, Levine reiterates that "Darwin was a Romantic" (141). What I think attractive about this chapter is Levine's research into how the poetic skills of Wordsworth were exploited by Darwin to develop his own literary skill, especially in his On the Origin of Species (1859), and how the narrative elements (such as analogy and anthropomorphism) in Milton's Paradise Lost aided Darwin in designing his own "literal creation myth" (141), which we observe interwoven into even the tide of Origin of Species. Chapter Six and Seven return to Darwin's key works. In "Darwin and Sexual Selection," Levine addresses the political implication of Darwin's theory for feminist studies, and how feminists judge Darwin's Victorian prejudices, as evidence for "his-story" being inept. This chapter examines two essays by Rosemary Jann and Eveleen Richards. Levine observes how these two studies "have been important in demonstrating that Darwin's very unscientific assumptions about the place of women played a role in the development of the theory of sexual selection in The Descent of Mart* (181). One such "prejudice" quoted by Levine from the Descent is a statement about the formation of the 173</page><page sequence="4">woman's skull. It "is said to be intermediate between the child and the man" (qtd. in Levine 172). One conclusion Levine draws from the feminist debate with Darwin highlights the possible impending heated struggle between feminists and Darwinians over Darwin's "obvious reliance on cultural prejudices," and this "disenchantment" may trigger many feminist scholars to take the position "that there must be something wrong with the whole theory" (194). In "A Kinder, Gender, Darwin," the key problem becomes what "image" of Darwin does Levine want to leave us with. Daniel Dennett argues that "[t]here is no denying that Darwin's idea [of natural selection] is a universal solvent, capable of cutting right to the heart of everything in sight. The question is, what does it leave behind?" (202, emphasis added). In responding to Dennett's rhetorical question, Levine attempts to overcome some of the pitfalls of the previous chapter about sexual selection by returning to his strategy already utilized in chapter five, namely, Darwin's image as a "Romantic," kind father, and seeker of truth. Many of Darwin's publications are quoted, to the extent that this chapter will allow it, but "there is no book more ostensibly deflating of human dignity and spiritual significance, more 'objective' in its self- representation, than his The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)." It is with this book that Levine makes his finest appeal to our sense of empathy and succeeds in persuading us to believe that "[t]he unity of the human races remained central to his science" (229). In my view, Levine's notion of enchantment arises from Darwin's anthropomorphism and the "flood of metaphors that does [Darwin's] anthropomorphic work" (194). Also, Levine's point about enchantment stirred me to contemplate whether "Darwin's religion was in nature" (31). Likewise, Levine says in the Epilogue, I began with a bumper sticker, facetious and ironic, perhaps, but also serious. "Darwin Loves You" is a claim for an enchanted secularity. . . The resort to religious language is inescapable , and part of the point. The world Darwin reveals is one that is worthy of the awe, wonder, admiration, and fear that has traditionally been arrogated to the world of religion. (272, emphasis added). Levine is undeniably worthy of praise because of his honesty about the religious elements of Darwin's work, but I felt Darwin Loves You "ought" to have professed clearly what this "nature religion" is founded on. In Darwin's Metaphor (1985), Robert Young argues that Darwin's anthropomorphism is a result of the "natural analogue" (85) inherent in the language of "natural" and 174</page><page sequence="5">"selection," but this analogue is present because, according to Stephen J. Gould in The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), Darwin's notion of natural selection is Adam Smith's ideas about economy transferred to nature (122). If my observation is correct, then, Levine's notion of enchantment is founded on a materialistic world-view about nature. Lastly, Darwin Lopes You is an interesting read for anyone looking for a critical understanding from outside the domain of science of Darwin's writings and Darwinism.
