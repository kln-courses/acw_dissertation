<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS THE IMAGE OF DAGON THE GOD OF THE PHILISTINES PAR Itamar SINGER Tel Aviv University In the study of Philistine religion there is a long held view that upon their arrival in Canaan, the Philistines adopted the deities of their new land, or have identified their own gods with those of Canaan. This concept, which had already been stated in the first studies on the Philistines I has not been seriously challenged since, and is still the most currently held view. 2 The meagre attention given to the Philistine pantheon is no doubt due to the fact that no written sources of the Philistines themselves have turned up yet which could shed any additional light on the subject, and the Bible has remained our main source for the names of the Philistine gods. Nevertheless, the rich cultic finds discovered in recent archaeological excavations in Philistia and elsewhere call for a re- examination of the whole issue. The oldest literary source on Philistine religion is still the Bible. Egyptian, Assyrian or Babylonian sources, which have adduced considerable knowledge on Philistine his- tory, have very little to say on the subject of Philistine religion. On the other hand, a wealth of information on cult and religion in the Philistine cities can be obtained from Classical sources covering nearly a millennium, from Herodotes in the fifth century B.C. to the advent of Christianity in the fifth century A.D. However, we may use these sources only to a very limited extent. Even if some original elements of Philistine reli- 1. See, e.g., G.A.

As a rule, these late data can only be taken into account if they can conceivably be related to earlier documents. 1. The view that the gods of the Philistines are simply the gods of Canaan, either by adoption or by a syncretised process, encounters serious difficulties already at a first glance on the Biblical cvidence. The god Dagon, the main god of the Philistines, is never mentioned as a Canaanite god in any of the Biblical accounts. The list of foreign gods in Judges 10, 6 makes a clear distinction between the gods of Canaan and the Phil- istine gods: "And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Ba'als and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the Lord, and did not serve him." Clearly the Ba'als and the Ashtaroth represent the dei- ties of Canaan, and the god(s) of the Philistines appear as a separate entity, just as the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab and Amon. Dagon, the principal Philistine deity, is only mentioned in three episodes in the Biblc: The death of Samson in Gaza (Jud. 16, 23); the captured Ark of the Covenant in Ashdod (I Sam. 5, 2-7); and the Chronicler's version of the Philistines' mutilation of Saul's body (I Chr. 10, 10). Samson was bound and brought to Gaza where " the lords of the Philistines gath- ered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoices (Jud. 16, 23). From this description it appears that in this period the temple of Dagon in Gaza was the cen- tral shrine in Philistia. 3 Before the Philistine settlement, Gaza, the capital of the Egyp- tian provincc of Canaan, had a temple dedicated to Amon, the head of the Egyptian pantheon.4 Werc these two central shrines related to each other in any way? A third cen- tral shrine stood in Gaza in the Classical period. 5 It was dedicated to a deity called Mar- nas, a name probably constructed from the Aramean title Marna, i.e. a our lord. " Perhaps it was merely a designation for Dagon, like Adonai for the god of Israel. Marnas was identified with the Cretan Zeus (Zeus Kretagenes), a further indication that the inhabitants of Gaza traced back their origins to Crete. 6 Another of his epithets was 3. It has even been suggested that the Philistine Pen- tapolis was organized as an amphictyonic league. See B.B. RAHTJEN, "Philistine and Hebrew Amphictyonies", JNES24 (1965), pp. 100-104. 4.

It would seem that the Biblical tradition on the origin of the Philistines from Caphtor, i.e. Crete (e.g. Amos 9, 7), is actually based on Philistine traditions.</page><page sequence="3">1992] TOWARDS THE IMAGE OF DAGON THE GOD OF THE PHILISTINES 433 Zeus Aldemios, (i.e. " Cultivator "), 7 a name clearly related in meaning to Dagon. 8 It would thus seem that throughout its long history Gaza had shrines dedicated to princi- pal deities - Egyptian Amon, Philistine Dagon, and Marnas, i.e. Cretan Zeus - perhaps a continuous chain of religious syncretisms. Gaza was one of the last bastions of pagan- ism in Palestine, and only through the forceful intervention of Byzance did the bishop of Gaza, Porphyrius, eventually manage to eradicate the cult of Marnas. 9 Another temple of Dagon stood at Ashdod. Here was brought the Ark of the Cove- nant which the Philistines captured in the battle of Ebenezer (I Sam. 5, 2-5). From the description of the contest between the two deitics, 10 it appears that the Biblical author envisaged an anthropomorphic image of Dagon: "But when they rose early on the next morning Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off upon the threshold; only Dagon was left on him" (I Sam. 4, 4). From old a popular etymology of Dagon was cur- rent in Biblical exegesis, relating Dagon's name to Hebrew dag, "fish." Medieval com- mentators cnvisaged an ichthyomorphic image of Dagon, debating which part of him was shaped as a fish. This view even found its way into modern Biblical interpretation. No less an authority than Wellhausen, followed by many others, had suggested omitting the final n from Dagon, and to read " ... only Dago (i.e. " his fish ") was left on him. " This emendation, however, is unwarranted. The Greek version of the Septuagint has rachis, i.e. "only Dagon's body", which conforms with an anthropomorphic image. The popular etymology was probably influenced by the image of Atargatis I Derketo, the mermaid-like godess of nearby Ashkelon. There is no evidence for the fish- likc image of Dagon in Josephus Flavius or in the Talmudic sources. Philo Byblius in the early second century A.D. defines Dagon's name as siton, "grain", and identifies him with Zeus Arotios, i.e. "of the agriculture." The cult of Dagon survived at Ashdod at least into Hashmonean times. In year 147 B.C. Jonathan burned down the temple of Dagon in the city (I Macc. 10, 83 f.; 11, 4). The Bible explicitly mentions temples of Dagon only in Gaza and in Ashdod, but we may assume that his cult was more widespread, as indicated by the place-names derived from his name (see below). We shall return to Dagon and his origins, but first we shall examine the evidence for other deities who were connected with the Philistines. 7. He was worshipped at a place called 'Aldioma", which lay outside the city, and may be identified with the ' Itloza of Gaza" of the Talmud (Bab. TaIm., Avoda Zara lIb). 8. For the etymology of the name Dagon see below. 9. See MACALISTER, The Philistines, pp. 106 ff. 10. See M. DELCOR, 'Yahweh et Dagon ou le Jah- wisme face i la religion des Philistins, d'apr*s I Sam.

The description of the mutilation of Saul's body after his defeat at Mount Gilboa has been given as evidence for a Philistine cult of the Canaanite godess Ashtoret. l According to I Sam. 3 1, 1 0-1 1 the Philistines put Saul's " armour in the temple of Ashtarot and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shean. " Clearly, the temple of Ashtarot referred to was in Beth-shean, a Canaanite city which lay close to the battlefield and probably collaborated with the Philistines. However, Beth-shean was never a Philistine city and this verse certainly does not prove that the goddess Ashtarot / Ashtorct can be counted among the gods of the Philistines. 12 This unwarranted view was ostensibly supported by the fact that in the Classical period Ashkelon had a cult of Atargatis / Derketo, a goddess related to Canaanite Ashtoret and to Greek Aphrodite. 13 However, as pointed out above, the Classical sources cannot be used as binding evidence for Philistine religion, unless supported by unequivocal earlier documentation. While not ruling out the possibility that Ashkelon may have had a goddess of its own in early Philistine times, no evidence has turned up as yet to support this possibility. 14 In the parallel version to Saul's death in I Chr. 10, 10 the goddess Ashtarot is not mentioned at all: "And they put his armour in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the Temple of Dagon. " Presumably the Chronicler had thought that the Philistines were bound to bring their enemy's body to their main shrine and had there- fore substituted Dagon for Ashtarot. The verse however does not indicate the location of Dagon's templc and there is no basis for the common identification of one of Beth Shan's temples as belonging to Dagon. 15 In conclusion, there is presently no evidence for the inclusion of Ashtoret in the Philistine pantheon. In addition to Dagon, the Bible mentions only one other god whose cult was prac- tised in a Philistine city: Ba'al-Zebub the god of Ekron. Ahazia king of Israel sent mes- sengers to Ba'al-Zebub to inquire whether he would recover from his injuries, for which he was reprimanded by the prophet Eliyah (II Kings 1, 1-6).

This is all the more remarkable when one considers the great atten- tion given in the Bible for the influence exerted on Israelite religion by the gods of Canaan and those of other nations. The single reference to Ba'al-Zebub in the Bible, in an episode of the mid-ninth century B.C., probably represents a late stage of Philistine religion, when it had already absorbed various local elements. I do not think therefore that it should be attributed too much weight in the reconstruction of the original Philis- tine pantheon. This concludes the meagre Biblical evidence on the gods of the Philistines. Dagon clearly emerges as the national god of the Philistines, in fact the only deity who can safely be related to the early stage of Philistine religion. To be sure, one might even raise doubts concerning the credibility of this scarce information provided by the Israel- ite sources. We have intentionally disregarded so far questions regarding the composi- tion and the literary character of the above-quoted Biblical passages. The reason for this is quite simple: Even though the historicity of some of these passages (e.g. the Samson stories) is quite doubtful, there is no reason to assume that any author in any period would deliberately misquote the name of the Philistines' main deity. Besides, as already mentioned, the cult of Dagon was still practised at Ashdod in Hashmonean times. Oth- ers may argue that what the Biblical author recorded is a late name of the Philistine god, which was current in his times. In other words, Dagon could be merely the name of a local deity who was identified with the god of the Philistines or was adopted by them after their arrival in Canaan. This indeed could be the case if Dagon were a Canaanite god whose cult was well-known in Palestine before the Philistines' arrival. However, as will become evident from the following discussion, there is no evidence whatsoever for the cult of Dagon in Palestine before the Philistine settlement. Therefore we may safely accept the Biblical evidence for the name of the main Philistine god, regardless of the nature of the sources in which he occurs. 19 16. MACALISTER, The Philistines, pp. 92 f. 17. For refs. see C.H. GORDON, Ugaritic Manual, Roma 1955, p. 261. 18. A further clue has been sought in Isaiah 2, 6. See, e.g., DELCOR, op. cit. (n. 10), p. 152. 19. Unfortunately the only " Philistine source" which could testify for the cult of Dagon is silent in this respect. I refer to the small corpus of Philistine names found in the Bible, in Assyrian sources and in epi- graphic finds from Philistia. (For the latter see J. NAVEH, "Writing and Script of Seventh-Century B.C.E. Philistia: The New Evidence from Tell Jemmeh", IEJ 35, 1985, pp. 8-12.) There are no attested names built with Dagon as a theophoric ele- ment, with the possible exception of Dggrt inscribed on an eigth century B.C. sherd from Ashdod. The last let- ters may be compared to the suffix of Anatolian names such as Tarhunda-radu and Piyama-radu. However, I cannot explain the second gand this throws some doubt on the suggestion.</page><page sequence="6">436 SYRIA [LXIX 3. Before embarking on a quest for the origins of Philistine Dagon, two further sug- gestions to identify Philistine gods on the basis of epigraphical and archaeological finds should briefly be mentioned. B. Mazar has suggested that the Canaanite god Horon was worshiped by the Philistines. 20 The combined evidence for this comes from two distant sources. The first is a late Iron Age sherd from Tell Qasile which bears the Hebrew inscription " Gold (from) Ophir to / for Beth-Horon, 30 sh(ekels). " Beth-Horon may be interpreted both as a toponym and as "House of Horon ", presumably a temple which stood at Tell Qasile. The second interpretation may be supported in Mazar's view by an inscription from Delos from the second century B.C. which mentions the god Auronas as the deity of the town Iamnia/Yavne in Philistia. Even if one accepts this evidence, it still does not prove that the early Iron Age temples uncovered at Tell Qasile were dedicated to Horon. 21 Another suggestion was put forward by Y. Yadin on the basis of the lion-headed pottery cups found in Philistia and at other sites. 22 A similar cup was discovered at Ugarit with a dedication to Resheph. Yadin thought that the same iconographic identifi- cation may be relevant for the cups from Palestine, but this is questionable. In ancient iconography the same animal may appear as the attribute of different deities and its cul- tic significance cannot be simply transposed from one region to another without further evidence (see further below). Also, it has been shown that these cups have a long Canaanite tradition and do not reflect, as previously assumed, a Philistine importation from the Aegean zone.23 4. What is the origin of Dagon, the god of the Philistines? His name is undoubt- edly derived from Dagan, one of the foremost deities of Syria and northern Mesopota- mia. The Canaanite languages tend to alter a long accentuated a into o. An etymological connection is usually assumed between the proper noun Dagan / Dagon and the common noun dagan, "grain ", which is attested in Ugaritic, Phoenician and Hebrew. However, other etymologies were suggested as well: Arabic dagana, " to be cloudy, rainy ", Hittite tekan, " earth ", or else a yet unattested root from one of the non-Semitic languages of Mesopotamia. 24 From the following discussion on the character of Dagan / 20.

Dagan is a West-Semitic god, probably of Amorite origins. His land is Syria, from the Euphrates to the Levantine coast. The evidence for the cult of Dagan begins in third millenium Mesopotamia and continues uninterruptedly for nearly two thousand years. 25 Until the discovery of the Ebla archives Dagan's " homeland" was considered to be the middle Euphrates region, with Mari, Tuttul and Terqa as his main centres. From there his cult supposedly spread westwards to the other parts of the Syrian region. The evidence from Ebla suggests that from old Dagan headed the western Syrian pantheon as well. 26 On the other hand, his cult in Ugarit seems to be secondary. Although Dgn appears in Ugaritic texts as the father of Ba'al, and two stelae dedicated to him were found in one of the temples, 27 he plays a conspicuously minor role in mythological texts. His cult seems to have been introduced from the east, and indeed in one text Dgn is identified as the god of Tuttul on the mid-Euphrates. 28 Dagan, the foremost deity of Syria (" the Upper Land " of the kings of Akkad), was primarily the " Lord of the Land ",29 and consequently all that grows on it, notably the grain. Some have attempted to detect in Dagan the characteristics of a Storm-god. 30 However, these traits, if at all pertinent, are no doubt secondary, and relate to the fact that Dagan is an earth and vegetation deity. 31 This basic character of Dagan may pro- vide the key for our search for Dagan's parallels west of the Levant and the origins of Philistine Dagon. 25.

In fact, there is no evidence for the common assumption that Dagon was amongst the gods of Palestine in the Canaanite period. Silent evidence from various sources corroborates this some- what surprising conclusion. a) As stated already, in the Biblical sources Dagon never appears as a Canaanite god. His name is also absent in the Amarna letters from Palestine and in the few Canaanite inscriptions from this country. b) Some more evidence on the Canaanite pantheon is supplied by Egyptian docu- ments. Throughout the New Kingdom, but especially during the nineteenth and the twentieth dynastics, many Canaanite gods, practically all the major deities of the Canaanite pantheon, were adopted in Egypt. 32 We find there Ba'al, Ashtoret, Anat, Reshef and Horon, but no sign of Daga/on. This is an indirect but most valuable argu- ment, which cannot be explained (as in the case of the Canaanite inscriptions) by the scarcity of the data. c) A third significant datum is the absence of Daga/on as a theophoric component in the onomasticon of Palestine. In the Egyptian Execration texts he is not mentioned at all (unlike deities such as El, Hadad, Anat, Shamash, Horon, etc.), whereas the Amarna letters contain only one Dagan name: Dagan-Takala in EA 317-318. Since Knudtzon's first publication, these two letters were considered to originate from south- ern Palestine, and this single occurence was considered sufficient proof for the cult of Dagan in Palestine in the Canaanite period. However, it has since been proved that these letters originate from somewhere in the Syrian milieu, 33 i.e. from Dagan's " homeland. " To be sure, even before this definitive correction was provided, a single name could hardly provide an adequate basis, especially in the context of hundreds of theophoric names in the onomasticon of Palestine. d) Another pertinent source which should be taken into account is the place-names derived from Dagon. Two places named Beit-Dagon are mentioned in the Bible: one in the tribal allotment of Asher (Joshua 19, 27) and one in that of Judah (15, 41). In Sennacherib's campaign in 701 B.C. a Bit-Daganna is mentioned before Jaffa, Benci- Barak and Azor. Similar names also occur in various Classical and Arabic sources. 34 Without dwelling on the difficulties in locating these places, suffice it to say that none of them has been identified with any degree of certainty, and hence it is impossible to ascertain the date of their establishment. The name Beit-Dagon is not attested in pre- 32. R. STADELMANN, Syriseh-Palistinensische Gottheiten in Apten, Leiden 1967. 33. P.

One may further add, that although their exact location is still unknown, the places named Beit-Dagon in the Bible and in Sennacherib's inscription must be situated not far from the coast, i.e. in the general area settled by the Philistines and other Sea Peoples. The cumulative evidence from various sources leads to the inevitable conclusion that the Philistines and the other Sea Peoples who settled in Palestine did not encounter Dagon as one of the gods of the land, and obviously could not have adopted his cult in their new land. If so, how did Dagon become the main god of the Philistines? Only two possible answers present themselves: They either adopted him from a neighbouring area some time after their settlement in Palestine, or they brought him in the first place from their original homeland. In the first case the nearest place for the adoption of Dagon would be the Phoeni- cian cities in the north. At the beginning of the Iron Age, the cultural influence of the Phoenicians was constantly growing, and they also exerted their rule over parts of the northern coast of Palestine where they could have come into contact with the Sea Peo- ples. Although there is no evidence for a Phoenician origin of the cult of Dagon, this possibility cannot be entirely ruled out. The evidence for the cult of Dagon in Phoeni- cia itself is rather ambiguous. True, Dagon is an important god in Philo's Phoenician History (see below). However, according to earlier sources on Phoenicia, such as the early Phoenician inscriptions or the list of witness-gods in the treaty between Assarha- don and Ba'al the king of Tyre, Dagon plays a very minor role. Although Ashmunezer the king of Sidon mentions Dor and Jaffa " the mighty lands of Dgn", 38 in his own town he only erected temples to Ashtoret, Ba'al and Ashmun. The second option, namely that the Philistines have brought Dagon with them, seems to me far more likely. To investigate this possibility we must direct our gaze northwards, towards the homelands of the Sea Peoples and the itinerary of their odyssey 35. W.

Dgn should probably be vocalized Dagon rather than the common noun dagan.</page><page sequence="10">440 SYRIA [LXIX to Canaan. Although this is a most complicated and disputed issue, we may neverthe- less summarize the reasonable common opinion along the following general lines :39 Their original homelands must be sought within the Western Anatolian, Aegean and the southern Balkanic realm; thence some of the Sea Peoples turned eastwards towards the Levantine coasts passing on their way through Cyprus and the Mediteranean coast of Turkey. These massive population movements must have extended over a period of several decades, with some groups settling in Cyprus and the northern Levant, whereas others continued towards Egyptian dominated Canaan. 40 It is most probable that the Sea Peoples passed on their way to Canaan in the northern Levant, and perhaps it was there that they encountered and adopted the cult of Dagan / Dagon. 6. Whether the Philistines adopted Dagan / Dagon in Syria on their way to Canaan, or whether they adopted him later from the Phoenicians - in either case the primary questions remain to be answered: Who was the Philistines' main deity in their home- land and why did they adopt Dagan / Dagon as the head of their pantheon in their new land ? Some important clues to these basic questions may be supplied by the rapidly expanding archaeological evidence from Philistia and neighbouring regions. The most significant cultic finds were unearthed at Ashdod in the sixties41 and more recently at Tell Qasile42 and Tel Miqne / Ekron.43 The cultic inventar from Ashdod is dominated by the complete clay figurine of a seated goddess who was nicknamed " Ashdoda. " 44 Many similar fragments were found at Ashdod (in levels ranging from the twelfth to the eighth century) and at Ekron. Tell Qasile (Stratum X) yielded a fragmentary mother-goddess type figurine holding an infant. 45 It seems that in the early Philistine cultic repertory from Philistia there is a clear prevalence of female figurines. The inhabitants of Ashdod must have worshipped a mother goddess, something which may appear prima facie to contradict the Biblical evi- dence, according to which Ashdod was a cult centre of the god Dagon. The excavator, M. Dothan, has sought to solve this apparent discrepancy by assuming a short interval 39. For a summary of the various views (with previ- ous literature) see I.

In the elev- enth century B.C. the cult of Canaanite Dagon was ostensibly resumed at Ashdod and this is the reality reflected in the Bible. 46 This explanation may have been valid if there was any evidence for the cult of Dagon in Canaanite Ashdod, or for that matter, any- where nearby. However, as pointed out above, there is no evidence whatsoever for including Dagan / Dagon in the pantheon of Canaanite Palestine. The apparent discrep- ancy between the archaeological and the literary evidence must not be resolved on a chronological level, by assuming a sharp break in the cultic practices of Ashdod, but rather in a harmonious way which would detect the synchretistic relationship between " Ashdoda" and Dagon. In other words, the question to be asked is how did the Aegean "Mother Goddess" come to be identified with the West Semitic earth and grain god Dagan / Dagon. To define more sharply the image of the Philistine " Mother Goddess ", we may bring to our aid several cultic objects from Philistia which appear to be closely associ- ated with the cult of the goddess: a) The so-called " Mourning Figurines ", which apparently represent female figu- rines raising one or both hands in a mourning gesture. 47 The best known examples come from Tell Aitun, Tell Jemma, Azor and Tell Qasile. On the basis of Aegean com- parisons these small clay figurines were attached to the rims of craters, which were usu- ally placed in tombs. b) Clay cups moulded in the shape of a lion's head, found at Tell Miqne / Ekron, Tell es-Safi / Gath, Tell Qasile, Tell Zeror and Megiddo.48 A lion shaped clay figurine was also found at Ashdod, 49 whereas at Tell Qasile this animal decorates the sides of a cult-stand. 50 To complete this " list of lions ", mention should be made of the unusual find of a lion's skull in the shrine excavated at Jaffa. 51 Faced with a considerable number of cultic objects representing the same animal one is justified in detecting here a recurring attribute of a specific deity. As already mentioned, Yadin suggested associating these lion objects with the Canaanite god Reshef. In my view, athough Yadin's attempt to utilize this find as an iconographic indicator is basi- cally sound, his conclusions are questionable. In the ancient Near Eastern iconography, it is quite usual to find the same animal sacred to various deities, especially when deal- 46. M.

The lion cup from Tell Qasile, e.g., was found in a favissa of the Stratum XI temple together with a libation figurine shaped as a female figure, 53 repre- senting perhaps the local deity. I shall suggest below a different iconographic associa- tion of the lion shaped cult vessels. Besides these two cult vessels - " the mourning figurines " and the lion vessels - there were many more cult objects found in Philistine contexts: kernoi (adorned with birds, pomegranates and miniature bowls) and various cult stands (such as the " musicians' stand" from Ashdod and the " dancers' stand" from Tell Qasile). However, this sort of vessels are too common and widespread to serve as independent icono- graphic indicators. Perhaps they may eventually round off the picture drawn from other more indicative data. 7. In the following quest for the origins of the Philistine deity west of the Levant we shall be using primarily the guidelines of syncretism, i.e. the parallels drawn in antiq- uity between various regional pantheons and their occasional fusions. 54 This is undoubt- edly a most complex and elusive world, which may sometimes appear to the modern beholder as lacking in system and rationale. For example, the same Semitic deity may sometimes be equated with different Greek deities, and vice versa. However, it would be wrong to approach ancient religions and syncretistic schemes with an overly strict and systematic logic. Although the ancient theologians have often left what seems to us unclear equations or too broad overlappings, nevertheless they established general schemes encompassing extensive areas which are extremely important for the compara- tive study of ancient religions. It should be added that in order to reconstruct a coher- ent syncretistic picture, it is expedient to compare not just individual deities, but rather the overall system of parallel pantheons which are usually built in a genealogical struc- ture of several generations. The best evidence on the creation of ancient pantheons is found in the theogonies of various mythologies, such as the Greek Theogony of Hesiod and the Hurrian-Hittite myth of " Kingship in Heaven" (Kumarbi). 55 The structure of the Canaanite pantheon is known mainly from the Ugaritic mythology56 and from lists of deities from Ugarit. 57 52.

According to Philo his source was the priest Sanchuniathon, who supposedly lived in the age of the Trojan War. However, in Philo's description (quoted mainly by Eusebius) a marked Hellenistic influence is apparent, among other things in the syncretisms between Semitic and Greek gods. 58 Notwithstanding the chronological and the geographical gap (Ugarit vs. Byblos), there is a striking similarity between the Phoenician pantheon in Philo's description and its Canaanite antecedents. Despite its lateness this important source should not be discarded, and its interest for the issue discussed here is particu- larly important because of its synchretistic tendencies in comparing eastern and western pantheons. According to Philo, Uranos and Ge have given birth to El-Kronos and to Dagon; in the latter's house was born Zeus Demarus, i.e. Ba'al-Hadad. According to the Greek Theogony Kronos and his sister Rhea have given birth to Zeus and the other Olympic gods. To the comparative table we may add the three generations of Hurrian deities according to the Hurrian-Hittite mythology from Hattusha. Hufrian Myth Ugaritic Myth Phylo of Byblos Greek Theogony Anu Uranos - Ge Uranos - Ge Kumarbi El, Dagon El/Kronos, Dagon Kronos - Rhea Tegub Ba'al Zeus (Ba'al) Zeus Obviously, the table above may be further broadened by adding more deities from the pantheons represented and also by adding further columns from other pantheons. We shall concentrate however on Dagon and his counterparts in various pantheons. The equation between Dagon / Dagan and Hurrian Kumarbi enables the addition of further parallels from Anatolia, 59 whereas the parallel with the Titans Kronos and Rhea may lead us to the origins of the Philistine deity in the Aegean-Anatolian realm. 58. For recent studies on Philo see A.I. BAUMGAR- TEN, The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos: A Com- mentarX Leiden 1981; W.H. ATTRIDGE &amp; R. A. ODEN, Philo of Byblos.

See, e.g., SCHOKEL, RLA II, 99 ff. and compare Pettinato and Waetzoldt, Or 54, 235 f.</page><page sequence="14">444 SYRIA [LXIX The equation between Dagan and Kumarbi has been confirmed by the comparative divine lists from Ugarit. 60 Like Dagan, his Hurrian counterpart Kumarbi was also a god of the field crops. This is shown by the divine lists from Hattusha, where his name inter- changes with that of the Hittite grain godess Halki.61 In the west, Dagon is paralleled by the generation of Kronos, the god of the har- vest, and his consort Rhea, the " mother of the gods " and the goddess of fertility. It is difficult to tell to which of the two the ancient theologians compared Dagon. Kronos, a male god, would seem the obvious choice. But Philo identifies Kronos explicitly with El. It remains then that Dagon is equated with Rhea, or perhaps more generally with both figures which merged into one. In any event, it is worth pointing out already at this juncture that the transformation of gender is not an unusual occurence in the world of ancient syncretisms. It should not come as a surprise if it turned out that the image of a female deity from the Anatolian-Aegean region was equated with the image of a malc god from the Semitic realm who fulfils a similar function. Let us briefly characterize the image of Rhea and her counterparts in the Aegean- Anatolian region. " The mother of the gods " originated from Crete, where she gave birth to Zeus and hid him from the wrath of his father Kronos. Rhea represents one aspect of the ancient " Great Mother. "62 From the basic image of the " Great mother ", who was a universal life and fertility goddess incorporating the functions of " Mother Earth ", " Mother of the Gods " and " Mother of All Living ", emanated many goddesses each representing a special aspect of the " Great Mother. "63 Some have tried to differen- ciate three regional versions of the " Great Mother" - the Cretan Rhea, the Hellenic " Mother of the Gods " and the Anatolian " Great Mother ", i.e. Phrygian Kybele. 64 It is evident that these parallel goddesses were identified with each other from early times and in the Classical literature their images have merged almost completely. Coming back now to the genealogy of the Greek Theogony, one discerns there three generations of goddesses which represent in fact three versions of the " Great Mother": Ge is " Mother Earth", her daughter Rhea is the " Mother of the Gods " and her granddaugh- ter Demeter, Persephone's mother, is the goddess of grain and agriculture. In contrast to the diffusion in the image of the Hellenic " Great Goddess ", Kybele the " Great Mother " of Asia Minor has preserved all these aspects and was therefore identified with all three of her western counterparts, but especially with Rhea, the Cretan " Mother of the Gods.

"Ashoda" and other similar Philistine figurines belong stylistically no doubt to the world of the Aegean " Great Mother. " " The best parallels have been found in Myce- naean Greece, Rhodes and Cyprus. This comparison has led, among other arguments, to the derivation of the Philistine culture from the Aegean region. 67 Before we attempt to define more exactly the origin of the Philistine deity within the Aegean realm, it is worth tackling a related question which has raised above: Why did the Philistines choose Dagon to be their national god in their new land? I think that the answer to this question derives from a concise portrayal of the "Great Mother" in the previous section. In their homeland the Philistines probably worshipped an earth and grain goddess of the " Great Mother" type, probably very similar in her character to Ge, Rhea and Demeter and their Anatolian counterpart Kybele. When they arrived in the Levant they identified their earth and grain goddess with the Semitic earth and grain god. As mentioned before, in establishing a syncretism the functional aspect was sometimes more dominant than the sexual one. Still, the cultic repertoire from Philistia indicates that for several centuries after their arrival the Philistines still conceived of their chief deity as a goddess, despite her equation with Dagon. 68 This reconstruction of the transformation of the Philistine chief deity may provide a harmonious explana- tion for the apparent discrepancy between the literary and the archaeological evidence on the Philistine pantheon, without assuming a major break in the history of Philistine rellgion. Another reason for the Philistine preference for Dagan / Dagon may be found in the linguistic domain. The premise that the name of Dagon derives from a Semitic origin has been generally accepted in research. 69 Even if this assumption is in principle cor- rect, it is still worth considering whether this name or similar names can bc traced in other Near Eastern language groups. Indeed, some Indo-European languages possess a very similar root to Semitic dagan, which actually means " earth. n 70 This root is pre- served in Hittite tekan and in Greek chthon (with metathesis). As mentioned before, it seems that the original meaning of Semitic dagan was also "earth." Perhaps this is more than a mere coincidence, and we have here another example of a word common to Indo- European and Semitic languages. 72 Moreover, besides the phonetical and semantic corre- spondence of the common nouns, there are also theonymic derivatives. In Greece, Dem- 66. T. DOl-A, The Philistines, pp. 234-236. 67. T. DOTHAN, ibia 68. The number of male figurines increases and sur- passes that of the female figurines only by the ninth cen- tury B.C. See T. DOTHAN, The Philistines, p. 251. 69. MACALISTER (The Philistines, p. 105) also accepted the Semitic etymology, but at least considered another eventuality: "Now strange though it may seem, there is a possibility that the Philistines brought with them from their western home a god whose name was similar to Dagon. We have not found any trace of him in or around Crete: the decipherment of the Minoan tablets may possibly tell us something about this in the future." 70. J.

When they came to the Levant they encountered the god Dagan, who was very similar to their goddess not only in a function but also in the close phonetical resemblance of their name. The equation between the two was straight- forward, notwithstanding the different sex. Their choice of Dagan was most appropriate for their new, grain-rich land (Judges 15, 5; 16, 22). 9. Let us return now to our quest for the homeland of the Philistine goddess. This might perhaps seem a hopeless task because the characterization of the sought-for god- dess is not sharp enough and also because of the large lacunae in our knowledge of the region in which we seek her. In other words, it may suffice to keep to the general resem- blance of the Philistine goddess with the " Great Mother " of the entire Anatolian- Aegean realm, without attempting a finer definition. For two reasons I think that the attempt is worth the effort. First, our knowledge of the ancient religions of the region has improved considerably in recent years, and correspondingly the Philistine cult reper- toire has also largely increased over the last two decades. This significant increase in the scope of the evidence in itself justifies the re-examination of the issue. Second, in cur- rent studies there already exists a strong trend to limit the scope of " Ashdoda's" paral- lels to the Mycenaean world, i.e. to one of the regional versions of the "Great Mother. " 75 Perhaps this view, which is primarily based on a stylistic comparison, is essentially valid. However, it seems to me that in the quest for the origins of the Philis- tine deity a stylistic comparison is insufficient, and one should bring into consideration as many iconographic and cultic elements as possible. Thus the purpose of the follow- ing discussion is to open anew the problem of the Philistine deity's origins and to point out new approaches to its investigation. The iconographic data regarding the Philistine goddess are quite few and it is worth repeating them: (1) On the "Ashdoda" figurine one may clearly discern a concave shaped headdress, a sort of polos, and a necklace with a long pendant. This headdress reappears in other frag- 73. See G. ZUNTZ, Persephone, Oxford 1971, p. 400. Cf. also the designation Gdan Ma in an inscription from Phrygia (KRETSCHMER, op. cit., 65; POKORNY, op. cit., 414). 74. The name consists of the common noun dagani tekan, " earth " and the suffix -sepa/-nzipa signifying personification. See E. LAROCHE, Rechercbes sur les noms des dieux hittites, Paris 1946-1947, pp. 67-68. It appears both as a regular common noun, synonym with tekan, and as a theonym (with the determinative DINGIR). In one text the goddess is identified as the daughter of the Sun-god. See O.R. GURNEY, Some Aspects of Hittite Reli- gion, Oxford 1977, p. 5. 75. See, e.g., R.D. BARNETT, "The Sea Peoples", CAH, 11 / 2, p. 374; T. DOTHAN, The Philistines, p. 237; A.

(2) If we are right in associating the " mourning figurines " with the cult of the Philis- tine goddess, this may point to a chtonic aspect of the deity, perhaps connected to some rituals of lamenting and the cult of the dead. (3) The lion(ess)-shaped cultic vessels probably represent the sacred animal of the god- dess. Perhaps we may add to the cultic repertoire of the Philistine deity some further, less conspicuous elements, such as the bird and the pomegranate which decorate various vessels, and the musicians who appear quite often in Philistine art (the musicians' stand, another figurine and a seal, all from Ashdod; cf. the " Orpheus vase " from Megiddo). The question is, to which regional version of the " Great Mother" can the features of the Philistine goddess best be compared? The stylistic comparison has so far led to the Mycenaean " Mother Goddess. " I would suggest that a comparison with the Anato- lian "Great Mother" is at least as feasible, and probably more so. The " Magna Mater " of Asia Minor, whose name was Kybele / Kybebe, was known in the past as the main goddess of the Phrygians, who was later adopted by the Lydians, the Greeks and the Romans. With the emergence of data on the more ancient religions of Anatolia, it became evident that the origins of this important goddess go back to Kubaba, "the Lady of Carchemish. " 76 The textual documentation on this goddess cov- ers the entire second millennium B.C. (Kanish, Alalakh, Ugarit, Hattusha, Emar),77 but the first iconographic representations are only known from Neo-Hittite art in the first millennium, and especially from Carchemish.78 In the Neo-Hittite statuary Kubaba is wearing a long gown and a tall poios head- dress, from which emerges a curved pigtail. She is usually holding a mirror, and some- times a pomegranate. She may be shown standing or sitting on a chair placed on the back of a lion. The cult of Kubaba penetrated from Syria into the Hittite Kingdom in the course of the second millennium B.C. In the first millennium her cult had over- shadowed all the other goddesses of the Hittite pantheon. 7 On the evidence of reliefs and inscriptions she was revered at least as far as the Halys basin. 80 The Neo-Hittite documentation reaches to the seventh century B.C., but Kubaba is still mentioned in an Aramaic inscription from Cilicia from the Achaemenian period. 81 76.

ROBERT, La dtesse do Hierapoli Castabala (Cilicie), Paris 1964.</page><page sequence="18">448 SYRIA [LXIX The Phrygians, who arrived in Anatolia at the beginning of the Iron Age, adopted Kubaba, and turned her into their national deity (Matar Kubile). The archaeological evi- dence for her cult, especially rock niches where her statuc was placed, does not precede the seventh century B.C. Thus the transitional stages from Neo-Hittite Kubaba to Phry- gian Kybebe / Kybele are unfortunately missing. Nevertheless, the equation of the two deities is uncontested, and is confirmed by an iconographic comparison. From Phrygia the cult of Kybelc moved to Lydia, Sardis being one of her major centres, and thence to the Greek cities of Asia Minor. With the Greek colonization movement in the west and especially with the advent of the Roman Empire the cult of Kybele extended over large parts of the ancient world. Most of our knowledge on Kybele's cult comes from Classical sources. 82 Her cen- tral temple was in the city of Pessinus in Phrygia, where a black meteorite stone signi- fied the deity's presence. 83 Similar to her counterparts in Crete and Greece, Kybele was a universal "Great Mother n - " Mother Earth ", " Mother of the Gods " and " Mother of All Living. In Phrygian, and cspecially in Classical iconography she is portayed wear- ing a long gown and a tall polos. 84 She is usually seated on a chair or in a chariot drawn by a pair of lions. With the cult of Kybele the Phrygians associated the cult of Attis, her ill-fated young lover. Like his Greek counterpart, Persephone / Kore, Demeter's daughtcr who was abducted to the kingdom of Hades, Attis (represented by a pine-tree) was also celebrated in seasonal rites, which had a wild orgiastic character. The cult of Kybelc had a marked chthonic character, both on account of the mourning ceremonies for her young consort Attis, and also because of her function as the earth goddess, guardian of the deads and their tombs. Another characteristic feature of her cult was the intense musical accompaniment. Kybele herself is sometimes shown holding a tympanum, and in one of her admirable sculptures from the Phrygian gate at Boghazkoy she is flanked by a lyre and a double flute player. 85 To sum up, despite the large gaps in our evidence on Kubaba / Kybele, both in the literary but especially in the archaeological record, we have a vivid picture of the cult of 82. For a comprehensive survey see M.J. VERMA- SEREN, Cybele and Attis: The Myth and the Cult, London 1977. For the evidence from Asia Minor see idem, Cor- pus Cultus Cybelae Attisdisque. 1: Asia Minor, Leiden 1987.

WILL in Syria 64 (1987), pp. 374-377. 83. The Hittites also had a " Black Goddess", whose cult centre was in Kizzuwatna (Cilicia). It is difficult however to accept her identification with Kybele, as has been suggested by F. KINAL, " Kybele als 'Schwarze Gottin'", IX Tiurk Tarih Kongresi'nden ayribasim (Pro- ceedings of the 9th Congress of the Turkish Historical Soci- ety), Ankara 1986, pp. 259 ff. 84.

Therefore the attempt to locate the origin of the Philistine goddess within this wide region is certainly not easy. Nevertheless, in comparing the various local ver- sions of the " Great Goddess" to the attributes of the Philistine goddess, it seems to me that the closest parallel may be established with the Anatolian goddess, Kubaba / Kybele. At the very least, this comparison is certainly no less cogent than the traditional one with the Mycenaean goddess. The points of resemblance to be noted are the basic image of both as earth goddesses (in the case of the Philistine goddess on the basis of her equa- tion with Dagan), the chthonic character connected with mourning rites, the general iconographic appearance (polos, necklace), the lion or lioness as the sacred animal, and perhaps also some other more universal elements, such as the pomegranate, musical accompaniment, etc. To be sure, each element in itself may have parallels in other regions as well, including Canaan for instance. However, the combination of all these elements provides the weight for the suggested comparison. It should be stressed that this is an indirect theological and iconographical comparison, sincc so far there are insufficient data for a close comparison between the Philistine goddess and Kubaba/ Kybele. Large parts of Western Anatolia, where the image of the Phrygian Kybele has developed, are still almost terra incognita archaeologically, especially with regard to the periods discussed. Current research quite often ignores this large region in contemplat- ing the origins of Philistine culture. Naturally one's gaze turns to the far more exten- sively explored cultures of Greece and the Aegean islands. It should be remembered, however, that the unbalanced state of research might distort the real picture, giving an undue emphasis to western comparisons. Therefore it would be advisable at the present state of research to refrain from conclusively deciding the issue of the origins of Philis- tine culture. At any rate, more attention should be given to the archaeological evidence slowly emerging from Western Anatolian sites, 87 and the large gaps in the archaeologi- cal record should be tentatively filled in from literary sources and cautious interpola- tions from later material. The iconographic-theological comparison between the " Great Goddess" of Asia Minor and the Philistine goddess, tentatively suggested in this study, may be an example for such a procedure. 88 86. Some would even trace back her cult to Neolithic .atal Huytik, where a clay figurine of the fertility god- dess shows her seated on a throne flanked by lion (nesse)s. 87. For a general survey see E. JEWELL, The Archaeol- ogy and History of Western Anatolia during the Second Millnium B.C, Ph. D. Thesis, Ann Arbor 1974. 88. At this point we may comment that the Sea Peo- ples' connections with Western Anatolia are evident in other domains as well (see SINGER, n. 39 above). This, however, does not strengthen or weaken in any way the validity of the arguments presented above.</page><page sequence="20">450 SYRIA [LXIX SUMMARY The image of Dagon the god of the Philistines has been discussed in this article in three consecutive stages. In the first part we attempted to prove that contrary to the common opinion Dagon was not part of the Bronze Age pantheon of Palestine, but was introduced by the Philistines. They either adopted him in Syria on their way to Canaan, or adopted him later from the Phoenicians. In the second part we portrayed the image of Dagan / Dagon in his Syrian home- land, and we examined the question of why the Philistines chose him to become their national deity, despite the fact that according to the archaeological record from Philistia they originally worshipped a "Mother Goddess " of Aegean-Anatolian type. A scrutiny of the syncretisms prevailing in the ancient world has revealed a close parallel between Dagan, the Semitic earth and grain god, and the " Great Mothers " of the Aegean-Anato- lian realm, who were essentially also deities of the earth and everything that grows and lives on it. The functional correspondence that explains the establishment of this syncre- tism (despite the sexual difference), was probably further intensified by a phonetic resemblance in the names or the epithets of the two deities. In the third part we attempted to isolate the iconographic features of the Philistine deity and to seek the closest parallels to it in the regions where the " Great Mother" was worshipped. Despite the lack of sufficient archaeological data, we found that a signifi- cant iconographic-theological comparison may be drawn between the " Great Mother" of Asia Minor (Kubaba/ Kybele) and the Philistine goddess, a comparison which is at least as tenable as the current one with the Mycenaean goddess. This last tentative sug- gestion does not in any way influence the validity of the two previous ones.</page></plain_text>
