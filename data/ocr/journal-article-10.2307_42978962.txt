<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 2 ^ Theory and Research We are often tempted to dismiss theory and research as unnecessary because we do not have the time or inclination. "Give me the methods and practical stuff that I can actually use. Besides, all that theory and research is way over my head." It's true that such texts are often diffi- cult to understand, and the main reason is because there is a particu- lar language used in theoretical discussions and research studies. We can compare it to the specialized language of other fields such as computer science, anthropology, or any other area of study that in- volves a vocabulary with specific definitions for terms. For instance, most of us know that a "cookie" is something good to eat. However, in the world of computers, "cookies" have a different meaning; they are messages sent by web servers. (Even the word "web" has a spe- cific meaning.) Making a complex text understandable does not mean we are "dumbing down" the theory or research. We are simply trans- lating it, using concepts that are familiar to help make associations. On a side note, when we encounter difficult texts, we can relate our experience to students (of all ages) who do not have the back- ground experience or skills to decipher what we may perceive as sim- ple. My point is that lessons in reflecting on our unquestioned assumptions are everywhere. Theory What is theory and why should we care about it? Just as fields of study have specialized languages, they also draw on particular theo- ries. However, there are theories that tend to cross disciplines, such as Feminist Theory, which is often used in humanities-based studies. There are various offshoots, but the major concern is the role of women. For example, a classical music scholar might investigate whether there were gifted women organists during Bach's lifetime. A literature professor might analyze Shel Silverstein's book The Giving Tree and argue that the tree is female, and the male character ungrate- fully uses her to the point of total destruction.</page><page sequence="2">18 Critical Literacy There are various definitions of theory: (1) a mental scheme of something to be done, or a way of doing something; a systematic statement of rules or principles to be followed; (2) the knowledge or exposition of the general principles or methods of an art or science, especially as distinguished from the practice of it; (3) a system of ideas or statements explaining something; and (4) the formulation of abstract knowledge or speculative thought; systematic conception of something (Brown, 1993, p. 3274). Such dictionary definitions may not be completely understand- able, so we can look for some common factors, which I would trans- late as basically: a way of making sense of things. We do this in real life all the time; after experiencing particular events, we come up with a theory to explain or make sense of the situation. If a student arrives late to class every day, we might theorize that her parents are irre- sponsible. Of course, we are making inferences- making connections that may or may not be accurate; there are a variety of other possible explanations for the student's tardiness. Some theories are more accu- rate or useful than others, and we look for valid evidence to support theories. Why care about theory? Because it gives us a conceptual frame- work and a way to organize our thinking. It also provides a common vocabulary, can help unify phenomena that may not seem related, and often leads to new discoveries. Research True research involves curiosity; we have a question and we want to find out more. We do this all the time in our real lives. For example, if we are looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe, we will probably ac- cess the Internet and search until we are satisfied with our discovery. This is a form of research, although in scholarly settings, we are ex- pected to meet specific standards and use systematic methods. Definitions of research are straightforward: (1) the action or in- stance of searching carefully for a specified thing or person; (2) a search or investigation undertaken to discover facts and reach new conclusions by the critical study of a subject or by a course of scien- tific inquiry; and (3) systematic investigation into and study of mate- rials, sources, etc., to establish facts, collate information, etc. (Brown, 1993, p. 2558). The key terms here are "searching carefully" and "dis- cover facts and reach new conclusions."</page><page sequence="3">Theory and Research 19 Research is important because we are creating something new. Through the process of examining information related to our topic, reading about prior research, and then conducting our own studies, we synthesize what is already known with new information. Subse- quently, it is our responsibility to share our discoveries with others who are interested in our field of study. Our research often leads to new questions, which can be frustrating, but also interesting and ex- citing. The sections below discuss theories and research related to my in- terests in critical literacy. As mentioned earlier, some of the concepts might be unfamiliar and complicated. Once you have a general sense of the material, you might go back and reread for better understand- ing. Critical Literacy The notion of "critical" when applied to theory can be traced to the Frankfurt School (Kincheloe &amp; McLaren, 2000), a group of scholars who included Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Jürgen Habermas, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse, founders of the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany, in the mid-1920s (Arato &amp; Gebhardt, 1978). Drawing on Kant's critical philosophy and Marx's critique of ideology, the Frankfurt School sought to uncover and ex- plain fundamental inequalities and hypocrisy within society. They utilized two techniques: (1) immanent critique, which involves ques- tioning a view from within, exposing contradictions between our claims (what we say we do; image or concept) as individuals or a so- ciety, and our conditions (the "truth" of how we live; reality or ob- ject)- exposing the discontinuity between the ideal and the real; and (2) dialectical thought, which "attempted to trace out the historical formation of facts and their mediation by social forces" (Siegel &amp; Fer- nandez, 2000, p. 145). Kincheloe and McLaren (2000) emphasized the nebulous quality of critical theory, explaining that there are many critical theories, they are always changing and evolving, and they purposely avoid too much specificity. Also influenced by Marxist theory, Paulo Freire (1921-1997) called for radical pedagogical change, advocating for a sweeping transfor- mation in ways of thinking rather than specific teaching strategies or</page><page sequence="4">20 Critical Literacy techniques.6 Freire was born into a middle-class family in Brazil, but he experienced poverty and hunger during the Great Depression. He studied law, but became interested in education as a young man, soon helping poor adults to become literate. However, at that time, adults could only vote if they were functionally literate, and Freire was ex- iled from Brazil in 1964 due to his "subversive" teaching. In the seminal Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970/2000), Freire ex- plained that exploited people do not necessarily recognize their own oppression. He wrote, "as long as the oppressed remain unaware of the causes of their condition, they fatalistically 'accept' their exploita- tion" (p. 64). Additionally, the oppressed "prefer the security of con- formity with their state of unfreedom to the creative communion produced by freedom and even the very pursuit of freedom" (p. 48). It is important to note that critical theory "refuses the propaganda model's assumption that people are passive, easily manipulated vic- tims. Researchers operating with an awareness of this hegemonic7 ideology understand that dominant ideological practices and dis- courses shape our vision of reality" (Kincheloe &amp; McLaren, 2000, p. 283). The solution, according to Freire, was a liberating education im- plemented by the oppressed in which the roles of teacher and student are redefined- teachers learn and learners teach. Contrary to conven- tional models, students' ideas and experiences would be respected as valuable knowledge. Instead of treating students as passive recepta- cles of information,8 teachers would encourage students to question their worlds, focusing on the use of authentic dialogue, in which edu- cators speak with not for the students. Freire advocated for a praxis (informed, committed action) entail- ing "reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it" (p. 6 Because we tend to associate the word "radical" with images of rebellious extrem- ists, it is worthwhile to consider a key definition, which is "of or from the root or roots; going to the foundation or source of something; fundamental; basic." 7 Hegemony in this context specifically refers to Gramsci's theory that cultural institu- tions effectively "win people's consent to domination." 8 Freire used the term "banking," in which the educator made deposits in the student. He abhorred such practices, explaining that "The more students work at storing the deposits entrusted to them, the less they develop the critical consciousness which would result from their intervention in the world as transformers of that world" (1970/2000, p. 73).</page><page sequence="5">Theory and Research 21 51). Additionally, Freire emphasized the need for hope- an optimistic attitude rooted in a sense of possibility that would stimulate and sup- port work toward improvement and transformation. It is extremely important to recognize that Freire' s theories should be viewed in terms of a philosophy rather than a set of methods or techniques; he believed that these ideas would need to be "rein- vented" for each person's or group's particular context (Graff, 2000; Macedo &amp; Freire, 2001). "Unfortunately, in the United States," wrote Donaldo Macedo, "many educators who claim to be Freirean in their pedagogical orientation mistakenly transform Freire's notion of diag- logue into a method" (Macedo, 2000, p. 17). The term "critical liter- acy" is becoming more prevalent in educational environments, but a watered-down or packaged version with a prescribed set of activities is not true critical literacy. Of course, these texts may offer useful methods, but by their very nature, they are uncontextualized. In other words, the activities should emerge from the needs of the students, the particular situations and settings, the educational goals, and the possibilities inherent in the educational context. Current theorists sometimes clarify critical literacy on a contin- uum in terms of other literacy movements. For instance Cadiero- Kaplan (2002) explained that functional literacy refers to the basic ability to read and write well enough to understand signs, ads, and newspaper headlines, to make shopping lists, to write checks, and to fill out job applications. Cultural literacy denotes knowledge of the canon or "great books," with emphasis on the teaching of morals and values, without regard for individual and community experiences. Progressive literacy, a liberal ideology focused on the student, "fails to examine questions of cultural and political context. Such practices, while designed to empower, are not transformative because they ig- nore students' cultural capital" (p. 376-377). Similarly, Luke and Free- body (1997) pointed out that "traditional, skills-based, psychological, and progressivist approaches to reading have more in common with one another than might first appear and certainly than is evident from the perennial debates among their advocates" (p. 222). Regarding empowerment, Freire would argue that it does not come from the educator to the student, or from the adult to the child. Rather, the educator or adult provides the skills that will hopefully lead to the development of a sense of agency, self-sufficiency, and confident decision-making. Donaldo Macedo, who worked closely with Freire and translated many of his writings, vehemently argued</page><page sequence="6">22 Critical Literacy against the notion of empowerment and "giving voice," explaining that if you have the power to give someone voice, then you have the power to take it away. Voice is prepackaged as a "gift" that is being given or loaned, and the recipients are supposed to be grateful and behave (conform) because the gift can be taken away. This delimits possibilities and there is an inherent censorship. Rather, the op- pressed must "come to voice," which involves: (1) political clarity; (2) the pain that is natural with change,9 and (3) hope. Macedo stressed that voice is not a gift; it is a democratic and human right. We- well- meaning educators- cannot give voice; instead, we must create de- mocratic structures so voice can emerge (Macedo, 2003). The risk and the pain, of course, come from the possibility that we will not like what we hear. As Macedo emphasized, true democracy is a common theme found in discussions of critical literacy, as are the concepts of social justice, possibility, and questioning. Perhaps the most unique element of critical literacy is social action stemming from readers' increasing understanding that literacy and who gets to be literate are related to issues of equity and power. Once we become aware of injustice, it is our duty as citizens to work to- ward change. Freire believed that non-elite people needed to master the dominant language. Students needed to gain fluency in the domi- nant discourse but they should also understand the underlying ethi- cal and historical context of Standard English and academic discourse (Shor, 1999). According to Shor (1999), "By themselves, taught in a curriculum that emphasizes isolated skills and rhetorical forms, aca- demic discourse and Standard English are certainly not democratic roads to critical consciousness or oppositional politics" (p. 22). Regarding language and texts, definitions of critical literacy usu- ally adopt an expanded definition of "text" to be anything that can be "read" or interpreted. For example, Morgan (1997) described "texts" as "whatever in our social environment can be read as a text: what- ever constructs a meaning through shared codes and conventions, signs and icons" (p. 28). This broad definition of "text" necessarily includes the inextricable aspect of social influences, binding interpre- tation of texts with making meaning of one's world. The "shared 9 Macedo (2003) asserted that the dominant culture avoids the pain of change, espe- cially involving hearing the voices of the oppressed. They have the privilege to with- draw from the conversation and regulate the dialogue.</page><page sequence="7">Theory anã Research 23 codes and conventions, signs and icons" represent discourse commu- nities (Gee, 1996), and critical literacy typically seeks to examine the mainstream discourse- the language utilized by the dominant cul- ture. The ability to negotiate various aspects of this discourse repre- sents (often unexamined) power and privilege. Moreover, language is not neutral (also Fairclough, 1995; Gee, 1997; Gee, 1999; Jaworski &amp; Coupland, 1999); rather, "linguistic forms are paramount, for they filter and organize information from the physical and cultural realms and transform it into the meanings that make up human knowledge and experiences" (Polkinghorne, 1988, p. 158). Language is social and political. Giroux (1993) explained that criti- cal literacy "points to pedagogical practices which offer students the knowledge, skills, and values they will need to critically negotiate and transform the world in which they find themselves. The politics of critical literacy and cultural difference engages rather than retreats from those problems that make democracy messy, vibrant, and noisy" (p. 376). "Messy, vibrant, and noisy" classrooms are perceived by many as out of control and undesirable. Problems with Critical Literacy As Cossett and Pipkin pointed out in Silent No More: Voices of Courage in American Schools (2003), teachers in the United States "are generally perceived- and often perceive themselves- as agents of the state, paid to do its bidding and transfer state-sanctioned facts and skills to their charges" (p. ix). Active implementation of critical literacy, or any "unorthodox" approach to teaching, can be dangerous- the con- straints are real and they can be costly. For instance, fifth- and sixth- grade teacher Hadden (2000) explained how she was inspired by criti- cal literacy in her master's program, describing an exercise in which "my students and I analyzed the overt curricula regulated through the Utah State Core Curriculum Guide" (p. 527). Hadden also sought to investigate the "hidden" curriculum and "null" curriculum, the latter of which she explained to be "what is deliberately made absent from overt curricula" (p. 528). She claimed to notice a positive change in the children, asserting that "once young students acquire the abil- ity and tools to analyze, they become extremely reluctant to discard them" (p. 528). However, Hadden was essentially forced to resign due to charges of insubordination, consequently losing her home and uprooting her family.</page><page sequence="8">24 Critical Literacy How does one simultaneously challenge and work within the "system"? I would argue that Hadden, despite her well-intended de- sire to enlighten her students, could have taught critical literacy just as effectively through a more balanced approach. Returning to Freire' s insistence that his theories should not be considered tech- niques but should be adapted to specific situations, Hadden might have enjoyed more success by using other types of texts rather than the state's policies. Clearly, it is important that readers be exposed to relevant texts, and I can understand Hadden's belief that the Core Curriculum Guide directly influenced her students, but the material should also be engaging, which may not have been the case in this instance. Likewise, the notion of investigating the hidden and null curriculum seems extraordinarily abstract, especially considering the classroom population of eleven- and twelve-year-olds. I also believe that it is common for a teacher to refer to her pupils as "my students," but I would expect an attitude of collaboration to be evident when discussing a joint endeavor, and Hadden's comment "my students and I also investigated and sought to identify the hidden curriculum in my classroom" (p. 527; emphasis added) seems very telling. The reference to "my classroom" instead of "our classroom" suggests a power imbalance, or at the very least, an unquestioned perception of educator as authority. Additionally, critical literacy certainly has the component of trans- formation, which is very important. However, inherent in the theory is the notion that an individual's consciousness must change before he or she can effect any apparent transformation upon the world. A gradual shifting of perspective and adoption of a questioning stance does represent tremendous change- the way in which a person thinks and acts will necessarily have an influence on his or her sur- roundings. Therefore, it would be unwise to speed up the process by insisting on immediate, tangible results without sufficient time for reflection. Such haste and dogmatism10 explain some of the objections to using critical literacy: that it is political, it engenders despair, and it 10 By "dogmatism," I mean insistence rather than guidance, suggesting that the teacher is setting up students to arrive at particular conclusions and perspectives expected by the teacher. Students must be free to develop their own ideas. Of course, this is where risk and pain become possibilities: teachers (and other facilitators of critical literacy) may not like what we hear.</page><page sequence="9">Theory anã Research 25 is idealistic (Alvermann, Moon, &amp; Hagood, 1999; see also McKinnon 1997; Murrell, 1997; and Scapp, 1997). In an effort to practice critical literacy, I struggled to look at the various objections to this theory, asking myself if I am simply idealis- tic and naïve, especially in light of the fact that I am not in the trenches11 struggling with official policies like so many K-12 public school teachers. I continue to weigh my own experiences, arguments from other perspectives, and the possible alternatives. I must admit that giving up has occurred to me. But as an individual who was en- couraged not to think, certainly not to question, not to trust my own instincts, and to have my "reality" denied (that is, being told "that didn't happen to you" when in fact it did happen), giving up is not acceptable. Hadden's comment resonates: "I could never go back to the uncritical, complacent elementary teacher I had been before my graduate education" (p. 532).12 1 believe that implementation of criti- cal literacy is possible, but it is crucial for practitioners to be aware of the consequences, thereby formulating their approaches appropri- ately. As Alvermann, Moon and Hagood (1999) explained, "research- ers who use critical theory to frame their work argue that while it may be idealistic to think it is possible to change the world, doing nothing is not an acceptable alternative" (p. 137). (Also, see Meyerson, 2001, for an excellent discussion about the various realistic ways peo- ple can inspire change through their work.) Educational Environments in the United States Just as language is not neutral, education is political, contrary to many people's, especially the general public's, assumptions (Beyer, 2001; Gee, 1997; Graff, 2000; Graff, 2001; Shannon, 1995). In many ways, educational institutions perpetuate the status quo by not adopt- ing a truly critical perspective (Baez, 2000; Breault, 2003; Broadfoot, 2000; Cook-Sather, 2002; Garrison, 2003; and Tappan &amp; Brown, 1996). Giroux (1993) pointed out the socializing aspects of education, assert- ing that teachers "produce knowledge and they provide students with a sense of place, worth, and identity. In doing so, they offer stu- dents selected representations, skills, social relations, and values that 11 See "Notes from the Trenches" by Galen Leonhardy in Cossett and Pipkin (2003). 12 See also Marriott's "Ending the Silence" (2003) for a discussion of choosing action over inaction.</page><page sequence="10">26 Critical Literacy presuppose particular histories and ways of being in the world. The moral and political dimension at work here is revealed in the ques- tion: Whose history, story, and experience prevails in the school set- ting?" (p. 372-373). Likewise, Villanueva (1997) asserted that contem- porary schools encourage individual achievement rather than genu- inely fostering collective accomplishments. Additionally, Graff (2001) expressed the "need to make classrooms more democratic and less hierarchical, and the need to bring political issues out of hiding and explicitly before students' view" (p. 26).13 By neglecting to expose students to political topics in the "real world," and by avoiding op- portunities for vigorous, authentic debate, educators fail to effectively teach children to question, contemplate, and make up their own minds about important issues. However, in contrast to educational practice in the United States, teachers in Australia generally present texts to students with an em- phasis on their underlying power-laden qualities, encouraging critical reading and analysis in the classroom (Comber, 2001; Johnson, 2002; Morgan, 1997; Longfellow, 2002; Luke, 2000; Wilson, 1994). Neverthe- less, Luke (2000) suggested that this widespread practice may be "just a watered down version of educational progressivism" rather than true critical literacy, mainly because it has become institutionalized (p. 449). The danger of institutionalization lies in the "packaging" of a concept, neglecting to consider individual context and assuming that "one size fits all." More importantly, the transformational component is lacking, and Morgan asserted that "It would be naïve to expect that the state would endorse a pedagogy which proclaims its intention to undermine the economic status quo and the legitimacy of the present practice of government" (1997, p. 24). Official policies mandated by various levels of government greatly determine the overall educational climate, and the current emphasis on raising student achievement, combined with drastic budget cuts, has created an atmosphere in which experimentation with new philosophies and approaches to teaching is dangerous and difficult. In addition to escalating commercialization of schools and 13 As mentioned below, critical literacy tends to be more prevalent and accepted in Australia, and journals such as Australian Journal of Language and Literacy and Practi- cally Primary regularly report on successful implementation. For example, in "Critical Moves with the Wiggles" (2002), Longfellow introduced critical literacy to very young children.</page><page sequence="11">Theory and Research 27 encroaching corporate power that models a message of consumerism for children (Giroux, 1999), the current educational environment fo- cusing on reform efforts increasingly deemphasizes social justice and equity (Berlak, 2002; Necochea &amp; Cline, 2002). Equally disturbing is the shift of focus away from crucial issues such as "overall funding for schools, racism in expectations for learning, cultural mismatches between teachers and students, [and] the reduction of curriculum to test preparation" (Sleeter, 2003, p. 27), thereby diverting attention from entrenched structural and contextual policies and practices. There is a definite tension between the everyday realities faced by a classroom teacher and his or her mind-set toward promoting social justice (Kohl, 2002). Weighing the costs and benefits, educators most likely consider the preparation of obedient, persuadable students as preferable to the unconventional goal of creating environments in which children are encouraged to question prevailing ideologies- especially if teachers are members of the dominant culture. Neverthe- less, children can be guided toward respectful questioning in which they learn to value others' ideas as well as their own (e.g. Shannon, 1995; Wink, 1999). Sleeter (2001) claimed that the "cultural gap between children in the schools and teachers is large and growing" (p. 94), explaining that most White preservice teachers have "stereotypic beliefs about urban children" and they "interpret social change as meaning almost any kind of change except changing structural inequalities, and many re- gard programs to remedy racial discrimination as discriminatory against Whites" (p. 95). Sleeter also claimed an "overwhelming pres- ence of Whiteness in teacher education" (p. 102), an assertion echoed by Banks and Banks (2001) and Bennett, Cole and Thompson (2000), despite the fact that the student population in the United States is be- coming increasingly diverse. Preservice Teachers Studies support the claim that preservice teachers have a propensity to reinforce the status quo (Edmundson, 1990; Ginsburg &amp; Newman, 1985; Lortie, 1975; Pajares, 1992) and to avoid controversy (Lowery, 2002; Saul &amp; Wallace, 2002; and Williams, 2002). Ginsburg and New- man (1985) wrote, "Indeed, if preservice teachers enter programs treating political and economic inequalities as natural or unproblem- atic (and if they are not successfully encouraged to critically examine</page><page sequence="12">28 Critical Literacy these issues during their program), we may have part of the explana- tion for the tendency among teachers to function as professional ide- ologists, i.e., apologists or at least preservers of the status quo" (p. 49). Pajares (1992) also discussed the notion that such "familiarity plays in the political process of reproducing society. Most students who choose education as a career have had a positive identification with teaching, and this leads to continuity of conventional practice and re- affirmation, rather than challenge, of the past" (p. 323). However, the intention of this discussion is not to set up a dichotomy between con- formity and revolution; the point is to draw attention to areas that could benefit from the incorporation of new ideas. Future educators enter teacher preparation programs as "insid- ers" because their beliefs about teaching and learning are entrenched by the time they reach college (Pajares, 1992; Whitbeck, 2000). There- fore, future teachers "have commitments to prior beliefs, and efforts to accommodate new information and adjust existing beliefs can be nearly impossible" (Pajares, 1992, p. 323). Reinforcing the notion that preservice teachers are not particularly reflective, Pajares (1992) as- serted, Most preservice teachers have an unrealistic optimism and a self-serving bias that account for their believing that the attributes most important for successful teaching are the ones they perceive as their own. They believe that problems faced by classroom teachers will not be faced by them, and the vast majority predicts they will be better teachers than their peers. Entering teacher candidates view teaching as a process of transmitting knowledge and of dispensing information, (p. 323) Without explicit guidance and modeling, unreflective future teachers are not likely to recognize their lack of awareness regarding social issues, such as "white privilege." However, some studies have demonstrated that when provided with guidance and the opportunity to reflect on their attitudes and expectations, future teachers often hold differing beliefs and attitudes about education and literacy instruction through both their perspec- tives as teachers and as learners (Many, Howard, &amp; Höge, 2002; Whit- beck, 2000; Doyle, 1997), and their teaching philosophies are often "loosely formulated" (Richardson, 1996, p. 108). Pajares (1992) ex- plained, "Recent findings also suggest that educational beliefs of pre- service teachers play a pivotal role in their acquisition and interpretation of knowledge and subsequent teaching behavior and that unexplored entering beliefs may be responsible for the perpetua-</page><page sequence="13">Theory and Research 29 tion of antiquated and ineffectual teaching practices" (p. 328). Accord- ing to Maxson and Sindelar (1998), "more research needs to be done to determine how clear entering images are for the majority of teacher education students" (1998, p. 23), because students will not receive the maximum benefits from teacher preparation until they have a co- herent understanding of the relationship between their own beliefs and future classroom practices. Furthermore, Otis-Wilborn, Marshall, and Sears (1988) delineated several reasons high-ability individuals choose not enter the teaching profession: (1) they are "encouraged by others to pursue high status, financially rewarding careers in areas such as medicine, law, engi- neering, or business;" (2) there is a "perceived lack of 'rigor' in teacher education;14" and (3) the intrinsic and extrinsic rewards may not be satisfying enough (p. 108). Additionally, many future teachers' images and expectations regarding their future careers may be sim- plistic and unrealistic (Richardson, 1996; Whitbeck, 2000), partly due to their limited background experiences, especially with diverse populations. Moreover, future teachers' concepts of themselves as readers and writers greatly influence their expectations for classroom practices as well as the likelihood of explicitly nurturing a love of reading and writing (Draper, 2000). Reading Since the participants in the study read children's books and engaged in meaning making activities, it is important to consider the process of reading as well as various associated factors. Traditionally, chil- dren's literature has been viewed as a less important genre in the field of "serious" literary study for a variety of reasons, especially due to the belief that it is less complex than "adult" literature. Nevertheless, it has been considered valuable in providing pleasure and important learning opportunities for children (e.g., Bottigheimer, 1998; Galda, Ash, &amp; Cullinan, 2000; Hoewisch, 2000; Kohl, 1995; Rosenblatt, 1995). Hade (1997) asserted that "Reading is inherently social and is dominated by culture. And the meanings we hold about race, class, and gender (many of which may be stereotypes) mediate how we in- terpret text" (p. 235). Similarly, Luke and Freebody (1997) explained that "Reading is a social practice using written text as a means for the 14 See Berliner (2000) for a discussion of (mis)conceptions about teacher education.</page><page sequence="14">30 Critical Literacy construction and reconstruction of statements, messages, and mean- ings," and it is "tied up in the politics and power relations of every- day life in literate cultures" (p. 185). Apple (1992) claimed that reality is socially constructed, writing that "Texts are not simply 'delivery systems' of 'facts.' They are the simultaneous results of political, economic, and cultural activities, battles, and compromises." (p. 4). "What counts as legitimate knowl- edge is the result of complex power relations and struggles among identifiable class, race, gender, and religious groups" (p. 4). "For it is not a 'society' that has created such texts, but specific groups of peo- ple" (p. 5). Hence, both the process of reading and the materials being interpreted are power-laden; moreover, when considering children's reading materials, it is important to keep in mind the notion of avail- ability-adults typically choose books for children, thereby adding another layer to the concept of power in literacy. In addition to the sociocultural aspects of reading, attention to the ways in which individual readers respond to texts is significant for this study, which was informed by Rosenblatt's Transactional Theory of reading, which suggests a "reciprocal, mutually defining relation- ship" (Rosenblatt, 1986, p. 122) between the reader and the literary text. She was influenced by Dewey, who believed that the experiences of the learner were important and advocated for rich, democratic processes and interactions. Rosenblatt believed that literature plays both an aesthetic role by emphasizing personal response and an in- strumental role by bringing readers the experience of others, and she emphasized the contribution of literature to a democratic society, making explicit the broad social role of literature. Rosenblatt used the terms "aesthetic stance" and "efferent stance" when describing her Transactional Theory, and these terms can be useful for students when we want to demonstrate how we read (texts and our worlds) for different purposes. I like to use the example of watching a sunset to explain the response we have to purely aesthetic material. Although the response may not always be positive, it is highly emotional. Another example is the way we can become envel- oped in music- it "speaks" to us on a deep level that seems to involve all of our senses. By contrast, purely efferent reading involves finding information, which can be exemplified by texts such as the dictionary or a telephone directory. Rosenblatt's reading stances can be under- stood on a continuum:</page><page sequence="15">Theory and Research 31 Aesthetic Stance Efferent Stance i i Read For Pleasure Read to Find Information (Example: children's (Example: newspaper picture book) classified ads) Clearly there is much opportunity with such a continuum to develop a balanced stance, in which we read for both pleasure and informa- tion. This may involve two readings, such as reading a humorous es- say first for pleasure and then to analyze the author's writing techniques. However, it can also be a simultaneous process in which a particular text is both informative and enjoyable the first time we read it. Rosenblatt's Transactional Theory can be viewed as a reaction to New Criticism, the predominant literary theory from the 1930s to the late 1960s, which viewed the work of art as an object in itself, subject- ing it to close analysis, believing in a single "correct" answer or mean- ing to a particular text (which the teacher knows and expects the students to "find"). However, transactional theory should not be con- sidered simply Reader Response, which focuses mainly on the reader, because a text scarcely exists until somebody reads it. The following diagram indicates the place of Transactional Theory on a continuum: New Criticism Transactional Theory Reader Response J, J, J, Focus on Text Text + Reader = Meaning Focus on Reader Rosenblatt argued for a redefinition of terms, suggesting that it is misleading to speak of the text as "poem" (which served as a general term for any literary work). The text is simply ink on paper until a reader comes along. The "poem," on the other hand, is what happens when the text is brought into the reader's mind and the words begin to function symbolically, evoking, in the transaction, images, emo- tions, and concepts. That symbolic functioning can happen only in the</page><page sequence="16">32 Critical Literacy reader's mind. It does not take place on the page, in the text, but in the act of reading. The text in the absence of a reader is simply print- it does not become a poem until the act of reading makes it one. Transactional Theory insists that the reader's individuality must be respected and considered and that readers initially understand a work only on the basis of prior experience. They cannot make sense of a text except by seeing it in the light of other experiences, other texts. The reader's background, the feelings, memories, and associations called forth by the reading are not only relevant, they are the founda- tion upon which understanding of a text is built. And so transactional theory invites the reader to reflect upon what he or she brings to any reading, and to acknowledge and examine the responses it evokes. Clearly, the larger social context shapes meaning. Rosenblatt (1995) believed that literature should be personally ex- perienced because it "may result in increased social sensitivity" (p. 175), encouraging individuals to become more empathetic toward others and to develop a greater sense of responsibility for their own behaviors. This increased ability to imagine the human implications of any situation is just as important for the individual in his broader political and social rela- tionships. Many political blunders or social injustices seem to be the result not so much of maliciousness or conscious cruelty as of the inability of citi- zens to translate into human terms the laws or political platforms they sup- port. ... A democratic society, whose institutions and political and economic procedures are constantly being developed and remolded, needs citizens with the imagination to see what political doctrines mean for human beings. (Rosenblatt, 1995, p. 176) Hence, Rosenblatt's work corresponds to the theory of critical literacy, with its emphasis on the importance of democracy and social justice. Unfortunately, as with Freire' s theories, Rosenblatt's ideas are sometimes misinterpreted. Some common misconceptions appear to be the belief that Rosenblatt advocated more strongly for aesthetic reading, that one must "choose" to read either efferently or aestheti- cally rather than somewhere on the contiuum (see Harris, 1999), and that the Transactional Theory somehow precludes simultaneous in- corporation of alternate "lenses." For instance, Yenika-Agbaw (1997) wrote about children's texts, "Efferent and aesthetic reading must be reinforced with readings that propagate social change- readings that enable readers to ask questions about situations and ideas they en-</page><page sequence="17">Theory and Research 33 counter within texts. Such reading stances attempt to make connec- tions between real life experiences and print" (p. 447). I would certainly agree with part of her statement, especially when hoping to promote critical literacy with texts "that propagate social change." However, Yenika-Agbaw also suggested employing postcolonial and multicultural readings as "possible alternatives to Rosenblatt's efferent and aesthetic stances" (p. 452; emphasis added). Rosenblatt's terms (efferent and aesthetic) described the ways we read- for information and/or for pleasure. Therefore, it seems that Yenika-Agbaw confused how we read with what we read. Moreover, Kincheloe and McLaren (2000) explained that "oppression has many faces and that focusing on only one at the expense of others (e.g., class oppression versus racism) often elides the interconnections among them" (p. 291). In other words, it may be dangerous to select texts, especially for children, that isolates a particular problem from the context of the whole, thereby compartmentalizing the issue as sepa- rate and unrelated to other issues. Additionally, Freire encouraged taking a broader view of reading, going beyond "reading the word" to posit the notion of "reading the world" (See Freire &amp; Macedo, 1987). Reading the word is essentially decoding, practicing literacy in the narrowest sense, whereas reading the world involves investigation of power structures as well as our roles within these processes. Wink (1999) defined Freire's concept of reading the world as: (1) to decode/encode the people around us; (2) to decode/encode the community that surrounds us; and (3) to de- code/encode the visible and invisible messages of the world. I would add a fourth point that entails "reading" oneself; that is, examining one's role within the larger social, cultural, and historical context. (The influences of social, cultural, and historical contexts are dis- cussed below.) This broader view of reading is important for the study because many of us do not consciously question texts in order to discover our tacit perspectives. For instance, the popular picture book Olivia (2000) by Ian Falconer depicts an energetic pig and her various activities. Students say they enjoy Olivia because "she's so cute" and "she's like a normal kid." How can a pig be like a "normal kid"? Certainly, as white middle-class readers, we accept anthropomorphism (attributing human-like qualities to non-human beings or objects) as a convention of children's literature, which explains the ease with which we equate a pig with a child. However, Olivia is clearly a representative of a</page><page sequence="18">34 Critical Literacy white, middle- or upper-middle class lifestyle. She is shown with her nuclear family (mother in a dress and father in a tie), she has her own bedroom and lots of clothes to choose from, her mother takes Olivia and her brother on outings to the beach and the museum, and she gets to read books at bedtime. Unquestionably, Olivia is an aestheti- cally pleasing picture book, and the goal in reading should not be to deconstruct and disparage the text so completely that we ruin it. The goal should be to help readers who view Olivia's lifestyle as "normal" to understand that this text represents a particular perspective. However, when dealing with literature, I believe it is important to consider Rosenblatt's continuum of aesthetic and efferent reading. A practice I have adopted with students is "the first time for free" sug- gestion. Fu and Lamme (2002) recommended that "The most impor- tant consideration in using a book for any purpose in a classroom is that the children first appreciate and enjoy the book. If books are 'used' without first being read for enjoyment, the teacher is 'basaliz- ing the literature,' a practice that is likely to negatively impact the writing curriculum, as well as contributing to children's dislike of reading" (p. 66). Regardless of the reader's age or development or the intended "use" of the text, I believe that the initial reading should fo- cus on the individual's aesthetic response, followed by reflection. Then, subsequent readings can concentrate on specific purposes. Moreover, instead of prescribing the use of particular interpretative stances, readers can be guided and encouraged to make meaning based on their own concerns, questions, and purposes. Interestingly, Lewis (2000) argued for a broader view of aesthetic reading, inviting "students to take pleasure in both the personal and the critical" by addressing social and political dimensions of texts (p. 264).15 Drawing on literary theory, Apol (1998) recommended the nego- tiation of a "tricky balance between theory and practice," which inte- grates the content and methods of English departments with the concepts and strategies of colleges of education. Literary theory, which Apol defined as a questioning critical stance, can help readers (of all ages) to determine the ideology- the cultural assumptions and unexamined messages- contained in a text. She wrote, "Contempo- rary theories, I believe, allow us to imagine more- to consider the reader's response as a starting point, the beginning of a conversation 15 Similarly, Sloan (2002) claimed, "Above all, children need to know that the unex- amined response [to literature] is not worth having" (p. 29).</page><page sequence="19">Theory and Research 35 between reader and text rather than the end" (p. 33). Moreover, it is not necessary to teach readers the specific theories (such as decon- struction, structuralism, feminist theory, Marxist criticism, etc.); rather, questions can be developed that encourage multiple readings and careful examination of texts (Apol, 1998). Overall, children's literature scholars tend to apply literary theory in the same ways as "regular" scholars of literature, although Thacker (2000) argued that "The transformation of critical theory over the last few decades has meant that theory needs children's literature" (p. 1 [emphasis in original]), explaining that literary theory essentially ne- glects children's ways of reading. In addition to Thacker' s (2000) call for the application of children's literature to theory, she offered a valuable observation about reading, pointing out that adults and chil- dren read differently for many reasons, due to factors such as devel- opment and life experiences. This brings up the concept of nostalgia and how an adult's "reading" of children's literature might be influ- enced by his or her childhood experiences with literature- an impor- tant consideration for this study. Well-known scholars employing various types of literary criticism include Perry Nodelman ( The Pleasures of Children's Literature, 1996), John Stephens ( Language and Ideology in Children's Fiction, 1992), Peter Hunt ( Criticism , Theory and Children's Literature, 1991), and Roderick McGillis (The Nimble Reader: Literary Theory and Children's Literature, 1996). Likewise, Kay E. Vandergrift of Rutgers University maintains an extensive website of information about children's literature, and the Children's Literature Association provides a comprehensive list of resources, including criticism. Explicit application of critical theory can be found in Jill May's Children's Literature and Critical Theory: Reading and Writing for Understanding (1995). A survey of children's literature criticism does not seem to indicate a trend toward rejection of critical theory. Rather, much of the focus in the field is directed to- ward "legitimizing" children's literature through rigorous scholar- ship. Regarding criticism, Apol (1998) maintained that "Literary theory is a tool we can use to help us determine the ideology- the cultural assumptions and unexamined messages- contained in a text" (p. 35) "Because ideology- whether intended or unintended- is an inherent force in a text, and because writers, writing from within their own ideological positions, assume that their perspectives are 'natural' or 'neutral,' texts act as a subtle kind of propaganda and tend to ma-</page><page sequence="20">36 Critical Literacy nipulate unwary readers into an unconscious acceptance of their val- ues" (p. 36). Through purposeful, meaningful interpretation of texts, readers can simultaneously appreciate the writer's craft and learn more about their worlds and themselves. Writing Just as we learn (gain information and new perspectives) from read- ing, many would argue intuitively that we also learn from writing. That is, we learn more about the craft as we go through the process of writing, and we often learn what we think about a particular topic. According to Sperling and Freedman (2001), the writing to learn con- nection is more complex, and studies have "often ignored the diverse ways of knowing and doing that are associated with different aca- demic disciplines and fields" (p. 386). Sperling &amp; Freedman (2001) also argued that "Writing practices (e.g., personal writing, writing that challenges authority, and writing that explores new ideas) carry cultural values, and writing cannot in and of itself lead to learning without some congruity of values between the writer and the writing task" (p. 386). Hence, one of my assumptions in this study was that participants would not modify their current practices without scaf- folding and direct instruction. For many college students and instructors, the goal of writing courses is to reinforce academic discourse- the language of power and privilege (Gee, 1996) that facilitates entry into high-paying ca- reers and a comfortable lifestyle. The gap between the privileged and the oppressed widens as we consider the fact that many "disadvan- taged" students' ways of knowing are not valued (Moll, 1994), they are not proficient in academic discourse, and they may not be as adept at "doing school" as their white, middle-class counterparts. By contrast, the privileged students have experience with the dominant discourse and they are not encouraged, nor do they seem to be prompted by their own volition, to question the institutionalized preference for form over substance. Privileged groups, as Kincheloe and McLaren (2000) pointed out, "often have an interest in support- ing the status quo to protect their advantages" (p. 281). Smith (1997) underscored this point in his discussion of gatekeeping, explaining that most writing teachers perpetuate the problem by avoiding the issue of power and academic discourse, encouraging students to con-</page><page sequence="21">Theory and Research 37 centrate on improving their skills in order to mimic the accepted model of "good writing." In terms of future teachers' attitudes about writing, Briggs and Paillotet (1997) conducted a study with disturbing results involving fifty participants who wrote short-essay responses to an exam in which they were required to respond to writing errors. These preser- vice elementary teachers "wrote as if they viewed errors as deeply rooted in individuals, and as if they themselves were the ones with the answers the writers needed, but expressed few doubts about their own abilities or knowledge. They expressed many doubts about the abilities and knowledge of the writer" (p. 51). The researchers de- scribed these future teachers' responses as "hierarchical," "monologic," "haughty," and "negative." Briggs and Paillotet be- lieved such attitudes were evidence that the future teachers "were very good students of the educational system" (p. 57), and suggested that an attitude of helpfulness and charity would be more productive and beneficial. Regardless, their study illustrated how "grammar can be used to exercise power over people of lower status" (p. 46), with each group (university administration, faculty, and students) impos- ing rules on the next lower level of the hierarchy. Such a practice rein- forces the idea that "written discourse is not just 'situated' but is also 'situating'... helping to shape and maintain roles and relationships that are ratified in the broader social and cultural world" (Sperling &amp; Freedman, 2001, p. 377). Nevertheless, Briggs and Paillotet's research also reinforces my belief in nurturing writers' strengths in order to provide an encourag- ing context in which to address their weaknesses. I do not advocate undeserved praise or avoidance of writing problems. Students need to be challenged, but their work should be purposeful, their ideas should be respected, and they should be provided with a supportive environment. Along these lines, Pajares and Johnson (1994) noted the value of self-confidence in their study of thirty preservice teachers' written texts. Additional research specifically addressing preservice teachers' beliefs about writing includes Chambless and Bass (1995), who utilized pre- and post-tests with seven female participants, dis- covering that discussion, modeling, and practice of the process ap- proach to writing in an elementary student teacher seminar resulted in more positive attitudes toward writing. Similarly, Florio-Ruane and Lensmire's (1990) study used a combination of nontraditional field assignments and course content to gradually help future teach-</page><page sequence="22">38 Critical Literacy ers modify their ingrained assumptions about writing instruction. However, their study focused on helping preservice teachers trans- form their notions about teaching children. Regarding the relationship between writing and reading, current research indicates that "Because writing and reading involve the de- velopment of meaning, both are conceptualized as composing activi- ties in the sense that both involve planning, generating, and revising meaning- which occur recursively throughout the meaning-building process as a person's text world or envisionment grows" (Langer &amp; Flihan, 2000, p. 118). Additionally, both forms of literacy are viewed as "embedded in social and cultural contexts" (Langer &amp; Flihan, 2000, p. 115). Sociocultural Theory A common theme emerging from the information presented above is the influence of social, historical, and cultural contexts. The theory and practice of critical literacy, current educational environments, the beliefs and characteristics of preservice teachers, and approaches to reading and writing are all informed by Vygotsky's theoretical framework, which entailed the interrelated concepts of social learn- ing, mediation (semiotic; signs and symbols), and genetic analysis. John-Steiner and Mahn (1996) explained that these ideas are "based on the concept that human activities take place in cultural contexts, are mediated by language and other symbol systems, and can be best understood when investigated in their historical development" (p. 191). Vygotsky demonstrated the ways in which individual and social processes were not only connected, but interdependent, greatly influ- encing our understanding of how knowledge is constructed. Although critical literacy was foregrounded in the research, so- ciocultural theory definitely informed every aspect of my investiga- tion. Moll (1990) argued that Vygotsky's ideas "represent a theory of possibilities," reminding us that "there is nothing 'natural' about edu- cational settings" (they are social creations), and "point to the use of social and cultural resources that represent our primary tools, as hu- man beings, for mediating and promoting change" (p. 15). Regarding the idea of tools (or artifacts), which are created/constructed by hu- man culture, Vygotsky posited two types: (1) physical or material and (2) symbolic or psychological, which incorporates language. Conse- quently, our relationship to the world is mediated through language;</page><page sequence="23">Theory and Research 39 words and thoughts interact through a dialectical relationship as we make meaning and express ourselves. Cultural Models The concept of cultural models is informed by sociocultural theory. Holland (1992) explained, "In the context of social interaction, the in- dividual comes to internalize cultural resources, such as cultural models, language, and symbols, as means to organize and control her thoughts and emotions" (1992, p. 63). She also described cultural models in terms of "simplified worlds, taken-for-granted worlds" that are "stereotypical distillates, generalizations from past experience that people make" (Holland, 1998, p. 55). Gee (1999; 2001) emphasized the inextricability of reading, writing, and social influences, through his explanation of cultural models and situated meanings. Cultural mod- els are our tacit understandings of what is "appropriate" or "normal" and situated meanings are the ways in which we "recognize certain patterns in our experience of the world" (Gee, 1999; emphasis in original). Hence, we tend to interpret texts through unquestioned per- spectives, automatically making meaning based on our individual experiences and entrenched understandings. Gee (1996) compared cultural models to "movies or videotapes in the mind" (p. 78). An example may help to illustrate cultural models, which involve our unquestioned assumptions. A simple explanation would involve describing the attributes of a "bachelor," who is often viewed as charming, fun-loving, and perhaps tall, dark, and handsome. How- ever, a "bachelor" is simply an unmarried man. The words tradition- ally used to describe an unmarried woman have negative connotations, such as "spinster" and "old maid." A more complex cultural model involves the courtship-engagement-wedding pattern in our society. There are certain "narratives" that we typically accept without question: the man should ask the woman to marry her in a romantic way, he should buy a diamond engagement ring, they will set a date, plans will be made, and the marriage ceremony will take place, followed by a reception. There are other expected rituals or "traditions" involved and we tend to react or question only if compo- nents of this cultural model deviate ("the bride wore neon yellow!") Most of us view this cultural model as the norm, and there is nothing wrong with it. Many young women dream of being princess for a day in her own fairy tale wedding. Problems arise when we fail</page><page sequence="24">40 Critical Literacy to be aware of automatic beliefs and actions, when we do not see other possibilities because we unquestionably accept what is and al- ways has been as viewed as right or "the only way." The difficulty lies not in noticing unusual events, but in recognizing our own lack of thinking and reflecting about that which we consider ordinary. For example, a phrase my mother sometimes used with my brother and me was, "Get your cotton pickin' hands off..." to mean "don't touch." I knew that we did not pick cotton, so her comment was confusing; however, I understood that I was not supposed to touch something. As an adult, I realized that her comment was racist, although I doubt that it ever occurred to my mom. It was simply something that her mother used to say, and perhaps her mother be- fore. However, the matter became more serious in my mind when, as an adult, I found out that my mother's father was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and the "old family house" is Oxmoor, a former slave plan- tation.16 I made a conscious effort to avoid using the offensive phrase, but at the same time, I realized that I may have "blind spots"- areas of my life that need to be examined carefully for automatic, unques- tioned thoughts and behaviors. And so, "necessary and ongoing re- flection" is another form of research. Research Related to the Study The following studies are presented because they are similar in con- tent and/or design to my research. Although more detail is provided in the Research Design and Methodology section (Chapter 5), the study analyzed preservice teachers' responses to children's literature through qualitative methods, relying heavily on discourse analysis to generate a theory of the participants' perspectives. Unlike my teach- ing situation, the research involving responses to literature discussed below occurred in university classrooms that highlighted issues of social justice and equity, and emphasized the participants' future roles as teachers. Lowery (2002) conducted research in her children's literature course with 32 predominantly white female preservice teachers who composed journals and engaged in small group discussions. Explic- itly focusing on issues such as social justice, cultural diversity, and gender when presenting books, Lowery prompted students to reflect 16 One of my great aunts proudly described Oxmoor to me, adding that the former slaves' quarters are now changing rooms for the swimming pool.</page><page sequence="25">Theory and Research 41 on their own thinking about gender prior to critical discussions of the texts. Regarding data analysis, Lowery simply stated that she began to see three developmental stages from "reading students' responses to children's literature in their journals" (p. 27). In other words, a par- ticular theoretical lens or method of data analysis was not utilized (or, at least, not reported). One finding relevant to my research was that "preservice teachers shared initial warm reactions and sentiments to the books" (p. 28). Lowery stated that at first they "felt uncomfortable going beyond the pleasurable read" (p. 28; see also Grisham, 2001), and her students were apathetic to gender issues until prompted to think more critically. Similarly, using the controversial picture book Daddy's Roommate by Michael Willhoite, Williams (2002) collected data from 31 preser- vice teachers who wrote down their initial responses after hearing the book read aloud in class, focusing on whether or not they would use the book in their future classrooms. Students' follow-up responses contradicted their original reactions, demonstrating that the "majority of preservice teachers are willing to conform to the prevailing view- points of parents and community groups." In a children's literature class comprised of all white, female pre- service teachers, Saul and Wallace (2002) prompted participants to compose "dialogue papers" in response to reading Mildred Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. Students were asked to "choose any two characters, perhaps two teachers or two people of varying political persuasions, who would discuss the book. Then write out what each might say" (p. 43). Analysis of the responses (although not specifi- cally stated, the method of interpretation was apparently a type of textual analysis) revealed that 65 of the 71 participants created "char- acters who worried about what it means for a white reader to be en- gaged in a text in which white is not the norm, not the dominant perspective, and not what one would wish to be" (p. 44). As with my study, the goal of Saul and Wallace's research was mainly to describe preservice teachers' responses to literature, although I explicitly util- ized a critical literacy framework. I found many studies that utilized discourse analysis (which will be discussed later), and particularly relevant to my research included: ♦ Lewis, Ketter, and Fabos's (2001) examination of multicultural young adult literature with white, rural teachers and research- ers. This was an ethnographic case study, investigating influ-</page><page sequence="26">42 Critical Literacy enees of the larger context (society and educational institution) as well as the smaller, more immediate setting (professional status and identities), and utilizing discourse analysis to re- veal participants' ideological stances. ♦ Bean and Stevens' (2002) investigation of preservice and inser- vice teachers' use of scaffolded reflection through online and written responses was also significant. Using constant com- parative and critical discourse analyses, the researchers ex- plored the ways in which participants' "responses dealt with local, institutional, and societal dimensions" (p. 211). Their re- search was grounded in the work of Fairclough, "who posited that social structures position people in ways that tend to re- produce societal conventions and norms" (Bean &amp; Stevens, 2002, p. 211), a fundamental assumption of my own study. ♦ Young (2000; 2001) also utilized critical discourse analysis to investigate "four young adolescent boys' awareness of how masculinity constructs and is constructed by texts, both writ- ten and spoken" (2000, p. 313) through a framework of critical literacy. Similar to my study, Young introduced the concept of critical literacy through activities with her participants, al- though she did not specifically "name" the approach for her students- the focus was on the activities rather than an ex- plicit awareness of a "new" way of reading one's world. ♦ Rogers (2002) described her efforts to implement critical liter- acy with African- American adolescents. Drawing on discourse analysis, Rogers engaged in literature discussions with her participants, focusing on critical social issues that demonstrate that the process of critical literacy- both the learning and the teaching- is an interactive process dependent on the (local) interactions between the teacher and the student and the texts and curriculum (institutional), as well as on the discourses that are being discussed and critiqued (societal) (p. 784). The above-mentioned studies helped to serve as models for the de- sign of my study and interpretation of the data, and they also re- vealed the need for further research. Galda, Ash, and Cullinan (2000) explained how children's litera- ture is present- although often "invisible"- in current research fo-</page><page sequence="27">Theory and Research 43 cusing on reading comprehension or literature-based classrooms, and they called for more studies that "explore particular readers and par- ticular texts in particular contexts" (p. 374). Specifically, they sug- gested: We need more studies that are grounded in theory, whether it be sociocul- tural, transactional, narrative, or critical, and that use articulated strategies for a close and careful analysis. We need more studies that cross the bounda- ries among us, that allow us to speak to one another across schools of library science, colleges of education, and departments of English. Today we have many ways of looking at the complex issues that surround children's litera- ture. Scholarship can benefit from hearing from multiple, informed voices. (Galda, Ash, &amp; Cullinan, 2000, p. 375) In keeping with the above recommendation, my study utilized so- ciocultural, transactional, and critical theories, as well as bridging the fields of English and education. Based on my research, I noticed a lack of studies describing how future teachers read and react to children's literature. As mentioned earlier, research indicated that future teachers are neither practitio- ners of critical literacy due to their own experiences in the educational system, nor do they exhibit behaviors indicating a propensity toward adopting such a stance. Therefore, I studied a group of future elemen- tary school teachers, describing their written responses to children's literature through a framework of critical literacy. I also conducted open-ended interviews with seven students to investigate possible antecedents as to why they might adopt a critical literacy stance. Rather than attempting to predict how future teachers will present children's literature to their students, I focused on describing their cur- rent thinking about children's literature. The study will be discussed in-depth in Chapters 4 and 5.</page></plain_text>
