<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES OF THE HEBREW SECTION NOTES ON THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE FORTIFICATIONS AT HAZOR by David Ussishkin (pp. 1-5) The paper focusses on two elements of the Middle Bronze Age fortifications at Tel Hazor, which were recently published in Hazor IV. I. Revetment Wall 5503 in Area K, situated in front of the piazza extending outside the entrance to the city gate. Wall 5503 was interpreted in Hazor IV as a revetment whose face was exposed to its entire height. However, its face too, seems to have been covered in its entirety by a constructional fill. Thus the revetment was a foundation wall, its function being to support and help to stabilize the enormous earth fills of the ramparts at the point where the city gate and the piazza in front of it were located. II. Revetment Wall 10570 and Moat 10053f in front of it, uncovered in Area G, were interpreted as a stone glacis and a moat dating to the Middle Bronze Age. It is suggested that they date from the Iron Age (Stratum VIII), and that they formed a solid base for constructing Tower 10029. This tower was built in the northeast corner of the Stratum VIII city wall. Once Revetment Wall 10570 has been redated, no fortifications separating the upper tell from the lower city in the Middle Bronze Age are recorded. The question is raised whether the upper tell was fortified separately during that period. NORTH SINAI DURING THE MB I PERIOD — PASTORAL NOMADISM AND SEDENTARY SETTLEMENT by E.D. Oren and Y. Yekutieli (pp. 6-22) The Ben Gurion University expedition explored 284 settlement sites in North Sinai, between the Suez Canal and Raphia, which were represented by identifiable Mid die Bronze I artifacts. The distribution of the sites, by criteria of size and number of objects, indicates a distinc tive clustering pattern of base sites, which apparently coordinated the social and economic activities, and smaller campsites or seasonal stations. The homogeneous pottery assemblage is characteristic of the MB I culture of southern Canaan (Amiran's Group A, Dever's Family S), including features that are clearly of Early Bronze Age tradition. Significantly, the North Sinai assemblage is represented by late variants of the Egyptian 'Meidum Ware" which is recorded in late Old Kingdom-early First Intermediate Period contexts of Upper and Middle Egypt. The latter enables us to determine the chronologi cal position of MB I settlement in North Sinai (and southern Canaan) in ca. 2250-2150 BCE, and, in turn, provides an accurate date for the southern group of MB I pottery. The archaeological record from North Sinai suggests that the clusters of MB I sites belonged to pastoralist groups which interacted symbiotically with certain sed entary agriculturalist communities in the region of el Arish and also maintained limited economic ties with the farming villages in the Egyptian Delta. Evidently, com mercial activity or cross-cultural exchanges, particularly between Egypt and Canaan, did not figure highly, if at all, in the economy of the MB I pastoralists of North Sinai. It is suggested that the MB I population of North Sinai should be identified with the 'Aamu and hryw-s' (sand dwellers) groups who, according to the Egyptian sources, infiltrated into the Delta in the late Old Kingdom, dis rupted law and order in Egypt, settled in the villages and contributed to the anarchy that brought about the col lapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. THE GILAT SANCTUARY: ITS CENTRALITY AND INFLUENCE IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT DURING THE LATE 5TH-EARLY 4TH MILLENNIUM BCE by David Alon and Thomas E. Levy (pp. 23-36) Evidence for cult activities dating to the protohistoric periods in Palestine is notoriously scant. This situation has been substantially improved by the 1975-77 and 1987 excavations at the late 5th-4th millennium site of Gilat, located in the northern Negev desert, some 18 km northwest of Beersheva. In this paper a selected assem blage of objects and features which can be described as cultic in function is reviewed. These include the architec tural plan of the building complex where the majority of "cult" artifacts were found, a rich collection of violin shaped figurines, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic stat uettes, standing stones or ma$$ebot, and stone palettes. Finally, Y. Goren's petrographic analysis of ceramics from Gilat is reviewed. The source area studies of stone objects and ceramics highlight the centrality of Gilat as</page><page sequence="2">102* ENGLISH SUMMARIES one of the earliest cult centers in the southern Levant, with contacts ranging from Anatolia, eastern Palestine, Sinai, Egypt, and the highlands of Canaan. The summary presented here adds a corpus of hard data which will help establish the many dimensions of formative cult in the ancient Levant. A LATE IRON AGE TOMB BETWEEN BET IJANINA AND NEBI SAMWIL, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF HA?OR IN NEHEMIAH 11:33 by Hanan Eshel and Amos Kloner (pp. 37-40) The tomb was discovered east of H· Hazor (Kh. Hazziir; map. ref. 1685 1376) in 1984, after it had already been pillaged by antiquities robbers. The tomb belongs to the burial caves of the square type, with three benches and headrests. A small square was carved near each headrest, probably for placing an oil lamp next to each body. (An oil lamp near the head of each skeleton was found in an Iron Age tomb in Jerusalem, see D. Davis and A. Kloner, Ά burial cave of the Late Israelite Period on the slopes of Mt. Zion,' Qadmoniot 12 (1978), pp. 16-19 (Hebrew).) Pottery sherds from the Late Iron Age and from the Hellenistic period were recovered. This tomb seems to have been in continuous use from the Late Iron Age until the Second Temple Period. It is similar to the tombs in the Iron Age cemetery at Gibeon, and may indicate that the Land of Benjamin had increased in importance after the fall of the Kingdom of Judah. This tomb may support Alfs suggestion that Hazor of Nehemiah 11:33 should be identified with this site. "LAMP AND BOWL" FOUNDATION DEPOSITS FROM THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE-BEGINNING OF THE IRON AGE IN ERETZ-ISRAEL by Shlomo Bunimovitz and Orna Zimhoni (pp. 41-55) The authors reconsider in the light of recent excavations the long-neglected cultural phenomenon of "Lamp and Bowl" (L&amp;B) deposits found in structures dating from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the beginning of the Iron Age. Such deposits, consisting mainly of various combinations of bowls and lamps, were first noticed a hundred years ago by Petrie during his excavations at Tell el-Hesi, and were minutely described and discussed by Bliss and Macalister following their excavations at that site, the Shephelah tells and Gezer. However, mod era archaeological research in Eretz-Israel has only occa sionally referred to this phenomenon. Relying on published and unpublished data from the following sites: Lachish (Ills. 1-6), Bir el-'Abd; Haruvit, Deir el-Balah, Tell Jemmeh (111.7:1-10), Tell Hesi (111.7:11-12), Ashkelon, Azekah (Tell Zakariya) (111. 7:13), Mareshah (Tell Sandahanna) (111. 7:14), Beth-She mesh (111. 8), Tell Miqne (Ekron), Gezer (Ills. 9, 10:1-4), Tell Gerisa, Aphek (111. 7:15-17), Pella (111. 10:5-14), we have analysed the stratigraphy and typology of some 35 L&amp;B deposits and can elaborate on our predecessors' conclusions. A basic L&amp;B deposit was composed of a lamp nestled within two bowls (111. 9:1), the upper one turned upside down. Often, it was covered by more bowls or had standing bowls leaning on it. Occasionally a "cup-and saucer" was included and chalices were common in the late deposits. The vessels used were usually new and did not differ from the common daily reportoire of the stratum in which the deposit had been uncovered. Almost as a rule, L&amp;B deposits were uncovered beside wall foundations or under them, in room corners or under thresholds. They have been found in a variety of buildings: Egyptian fortresses, "Governors' Residen cies", public and private buildings. Stratigraphically, as well as typologically, the earliest L&amp;B deposits belong to the 13th century BCE, while the latest should be dated to the first half of the 11th century BCE. Petrie, Bliss and Macalister interpreted the L&amp;B de posits as some kind of foundation deposits and suggested that they served as a substitute for infant sacrifices and burials within the house foundations. The identification of these assemblages as foundation deposits has been accepted more recently by scholars and is also main tained by the authors. However, due to the scarcity of Canaanite foundation deposits during the Late Bronze Age, the sudden appearance of L&amp;B deposts at the end of this period needs an explanation. We suggest that the L&amp;B deposts were inspired by Egyptian foundation deposits and represent one more example of the adoption and adaptation of Egyptian cultural elements by the local population of Eretz-Israel at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Our suggestion seems to be confirmed by: l)The temporal correspondence between deeper Egyptian involvement in Eretz-Israel during the XlXth-XXth Dynasties and the appearance of L&amp;B deposits. 2) The spatial congruence between the area annexed by the Egyptians and the distribution of L&amp;B deposits. 3) The similar within-building location of L&amp;B assemblages and Egyptian foundation deposits. 4) The possible connection between the fine earth or sand which filled the lower bowl in the L&amp;B deposits and the Egyptian custom of pouring a sand layer over the objects in the foundation deposit. However, the content of the L&amp;B foundation deposits clearly differs from that of the Egyptian ones, and so the exact stages in the metamor phosis of an Egyptian custom into a Canaanite rite remain a puzzle for the time being.</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 103* THE MIDDLE BRONZE II RAMPARTS OF TEL DAN by Avraham Biran (pp. 56-65) Following the discovery of earthen ramparts on the south slope of Tel Dan in the early days of the excavation, it was decided to investigate how these were constructed in other parts of the site. The principle of construction — a central stone core with sloping earthen ramparts on each side — was found in all the areas excavated. The details, however, were different: in the south there was a vertical stone core, in the northeast and east a sloping stone construction topped by mudbrick, and in the north a complex structure of buttresses topped by mudbrick with a stone fill. No evidence was found of a wall on top of the ramparts, which had been built in the MB IIA-B transi tional period. The material used in the construction consists of the debris of the earlier EB and MB IIA settlements and soil brought from the surrounding plain. The building of the ramparts reduced the area avail able for habitation and the intriguing question remains — why build such a formidable defensive system for a relatively small community? AN EARLY BRONZE AGE III STRATUM AT TEL IRA IN THE NORTHERN NEGEV by Itzhaq Beit-Arieh (pp. 66-79) The article deals with the EB III stratum exposed by the author at Tel 'Ira during his 1979-1989 excavations. This is the earliest stratum at the site, and wherever the excavation touched bedrock, it yielded EBIII pottery. Also exposed were several sections of walls and living levels. Examination of the pottery indicates that this stratum dates from the first half of the EB III period. Considerable ethnographical importance attaches to this EB III settlement at Tel 'Ira — the only settlement of this period so far discovered in the region. Its existence furnishes proof that, following the destruction of Arad and of several small EB II settlements, the Negev contin tied to be populated, albeit sparsely, also in the EB III period, and was not entirely depopulated as had been the impression before our recent excavations. A STAMP SEAL AND A SEAL IMPRESSION OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD FROM TEL GERAR by Amnon Ben-Tor (pp. 80-86) The stamp seal and seal impression discussed here were discovered in the course of an excavation at Tel Gerar in the northern Negev. These two finds have so far no known parallels in Israel. Beyond the interest that these artifacts arouse, it should be emphasized that both ob jects were unearthed in the Negev, i.e. in a "southern" location, a fact of special importance in view of the objects' "northern" affinities and that both were uncov ered in the course of a supervised stratigraphic excava tion, so that their exact origin and attribution to the Chalcolithic assemblage of this site are beyond doubt. The seal (111. 1) is made of a grey-green stone, minera logically examined and identified as low-grade phyllite. This material is not available in Palestine, indicating that the seal, or at least the raw material from which it was made, must have been imported, most probably from Syria. As far as shape is concerned, the seal fits best Buchanan's type of "looped conoid button seal". The two closest parallels are found in the Yale University collec tion (111. 2), and in the Ashmolean Museum collection (111. 3), both of Syrian origin. A "Late Eneolithic" seal from Byblos (111. 4), also shows some affinity to our seal. Our seal should clearly be dated to the fourth millen nium BCE. A similar date, previously suggested for a seal of the same type from Gamla (111. 5), found in an unclear archaeological context, can now be confirmed. Syria should probably be regarded as the area of origin and dissemination of this type of seal. The second object (111. 6) is a clay fragment bearing a seal-impression with a geometric pattern on the outer surface. On the inner side of the fragment one can clearly discern the imprint of horizontal lines probably made by a woven straw basket. In 111. 6: c an ancient Egyptian basket is shown, with the thick black line indicating the probable position of the clay lump on the original basket. Thus the object described here is not a piece of the clay coating of a basket, but rather a fragment of the clay which had originally sealed a basket. The practice of sealing vessels made of organic materials is well-known in this country in the fourth millennium BCE, as demon Strated by the bullae found at ,En Besor. The Tel Gerar sealing seems to be of Syrian/Palestinian origin, as indi cated by the pattern of the impressed seal. It reveals a stylistic affinity with a series of impressions from Eneo lithic Byblos. Other possible parallels may be an imprint on a handle of a large jar, from the collections of the Israel Museum (111. 9), which shows a close similarity to an impressed handle from Byblos (111. 10), and a small lime stone stamp seal from the Chalcolithic site of Gilat (111.11). The ties between South Canaan and Egypt have so far received much more extensive treatment than the rela tions between Palestine and its northern neighbours. This is presumably due to the relative richness of obviously Egyptian finds in South Canaan. We are currently en gaged in collecting evidence for the links between Pales tine and its northern neighbours during the Early Bronze Age I. It is probable that these relations were of greater significance to Palestine as a whole than the relations with Egypt, especially when it comes to understanding</page><page sequence="4">104* ENGLISH SUMMARIES the socio-political processes operating in Palestine in the second half of the third millennium BCE. A FIGURINE FROM TEL IRA by Pirhiya Beck (pp. 87-93) A mould-pressed plaque figurine (4x13 cm) was found in the 8th-7th century BCE building located between the gate and the casemate wall at Tell ־Ira. It represents a hermaphrodite figure with female breasts and a phallus, holding a disc or tambourine which covers the left breast. Only four among the 22 figurines known of the group of solid disc-holding figurines are complete ("Ira, Taanach mould, Megiddo and Aphek). They are either nude or wear a short, decorated and banded garment, with arm lets and anklets. Although their particular function has not yet been determined, the origin of the Taanach mould in the debris of a shrine points to its cultic use. Hermaphrodite figurines are rare in ancient Palestine. However, two have been found in Transjordan — in Amman, Tomb C and in 'Ein Janin, near Buseirah. The first is surmounted by a quadruple spiral symbol, bearded and pregnant, while the second holds a tambourine and carries a lamp on its head. Although the three figurines represent different formal types, they nevertheless share one important feature — their hermaphroditism. This feature is particularly interesting in view of the close relationship between the Negev sites and the cultures of Transjordan by the end of the Iron Age — exemplified by Transjordanian pottery types (Edomite in particular), as well as by Edomite inscriptions found at H. 'Uza and Η 'Ira. Although Harding has suggested the identification of the Amman figurine with Ashtar Kemosh in the Mesha Inscription (accepted by Dornemann and Hommes-Fre dericq), there is no compelling evidence in the inscription for the dual sex of that deity. The identification of the figurines awaits, therefore, further evidence. A LATE BRONZE AGE EGYPTIAN TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM? by Gabriel Barkay (pp. 94-106) Excavations were conducted in 1882-1883 in the proper ty of the Dominican Fathers (St. Etienne, the Ecole Biblique) in Jerusalem, north of Damascus Gate. Among the finds unearthed there was a fragment of an Egyptian stele, which was published in 1892, but ignored in all studies about Bronze Age Jerusalem. The stele fragment bears a hieroglyphic inscription mentioning a title of Osiris, as well as the remains of an offering scene. The author was able to locate more finds from that excava tion, which could be associated with this remarkable find: 1. A large stone slab which is identified as an Egyptian offering table of the hotep type; 2. Two typical Late Bronze Age Egyptian alabaster vessels; 3. A small Egyp tian serpentine statuette of a seated figure (head missing), found in 1975; 4. Various architectural fragments men tioned by 19th-century visitors and scholars, including Egyptian "Lotus Capitals." One of these capitals was found by the author, built into a fence in the grounds of the nearby "Garden Tomb". This group of finds has a cumulative value and could not be accidental, but due to the early stage of research at the time of excavation, the pottery of the site is not available. The finds probably belong to the time of the XlXth Dynasty, when we have documented contacts between Egypt and the central hill country. Tentatively it is suggested that these finds be longed to an Egyptian temple located on the main road leading north from Jerusalem. THE QUESTION OF THE ORIGIN OF EARLY ARAD'S POPULATION by Yehuda Govrin (pp. 107-110) One of the main problems in the study of the Early Bronze Age is the question of the beginnings of urbaniza tion. Tracing the origins of the Arad population could help to understand how the framework of urban life developed in EB communities in Palestine. Settlement at Arad began in the Chalcolithic period (Str. V). The pattern of settlement focussed on cave dwellings. The material culture of Chalcolithic Arad was an integral part of the Beersheva culture. Petrographic analysis of the ceramic assemblage at Arad shows that the Chalcolithic pottery is completely different from that of the Early Bronze Age (Str. III-IV). This difference is also reflected in the ceramic typology. The results of this research indicate that there was a break in culture and a gap in occupation between the end of the Chalcolithic period and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Arad. Other studies carried out at sites in Sinai and the southern Negev show that in the EB there is similarity in both the petrographic analysis and the ceramic typology between Arad and these sites. In attempts to reconcile the evidence, it has been suggested that Arad was the centre from which the population spread to settle sites in the southern desert. Our research in recent years in the northeastern Negev led to very different results. Based on the patterns of settlement in the 4th-3rd millennia, and other data concerning the reconstruction of climate and environ ment, we have formulated a picture that is different from the usual interpretation of the origin and development of early Arad's population. The disappearance of the culture and population of the</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 105* Chalcolithic people from the region is a direct result of the process of aridization of the land. The new EB life style after the gap in settlement is different and incompat ible with the earlier agricultural lifestyle. Clearly this break indicates that the beginnings of urbanization do not date back to the Chalcolithic period. The finding at Arad of large quantities of everyday ceramics (whose origin can be traced to the southern desert) shows, in our opinion, a process of emigration and settlement of desert people from Sinai to the north east Negev. This emigration northwards of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples can be explained by the continu ing aridization process that the area underwent in the early 3rd millennium BCE. This new population of the northeastern Negev adopted traditions and cultures quickly, including newly developed economic resources. It adapted well to the environment — economically, socially and politically — and built an urban community at a point in time in the region. CHALCOLITHIC SETTLEMENTS IN WESTERN SAMARIA by Ram Gophna and Zvika Zuk (pp. 111-118) The Chalcolithic settlements in western Samaria de scribed in this article represent a specific aspect of the larger picture of the Chalcolithic occupation of the coun try's highlands. Indeed, it is only recently that archaeolo gists have begun to pay attention to Chalcolithic sites in the steeply scarped and forested mountain areas of the country, within the heartland of the Mediterranean (ar boreal) vegetation territory. Several of these Chalcolithic settlements are known not only in the western Samaria hills but also in the Judean and Galilean mountains. The people who established the settlements in the Samaria hills created agricultural lands on the hill terraces as well as in the valley bottoms of the wadis; they did so near the location of springs where they built their houses. The vessels used by the inhabitants were made by local pot ters, as proved by the clay which is typical of this region. In the light of this fact, and given the particular assem blage of pottery types, it can be assumed that there existed at these sites during the late Chalcolithic period permanent settlements whose inhabitants subsisted on agriculture and pasturage. The Chalcolithic population in western Samaria was apparently an offshoot of the population that occupied the west side of the Central Coastal Plain during the Chalcolithic period. In addition to the similarity in their respective pottery assemblages, secondary burial in pot tery ossuaries appears to have been common to both populations, as was recently demonstrated in the Nahal Kana Cave excavations. So far, no large Chalcolithic settlement exceeding sev eral hectares in area has been discovered in the Central Coastal Plain. Moreover, nothing like the hierarchy of settlements that Levi postulated for the southern part of the Coastal Plain and the northern Negev has been detected. Hence it is doubtful whether the 'chiefdom' model he suggested as most suited to the social organiza tion of Eretz-Israel during the late Chalcolithic period, is applicable to the populations of the Central Coastal Plain and western Samaria. POTTERY FROM CHALCOLITHIC AND EARLY BRONZE AGE I CEMETERIES IN ISRAEL: SOME NEW ASPECT S OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY BY YUVAL G0REN (pp. 119-126) Petrographic studies of ceramic assemblages from Chal colithic mortuary sites in the coastal plain reveal that the common pottery vessels found at these sites — bowls, incense burners — are usually formed of the local fjamra soil. This raw material is barely suitable for ceramic production, and forms crumbly and crude vessels. It is unlikely that this pottery was intended for daily use. Such is also the situation in the case of the Early Bronze Age I "gray-burnished ware" from mortuary sites in east Sa maria. The latter was formed of the local lower creta ceous shales, without any attempt to select the suitable clay horizon or to improve its technical properties. Therefore, it may be concluded that in both cases, this pottery was intended only for funerary purposes. Fur thermore, since these vessels were not suitable for daily use, it is suggested that they were intentionally made of low quality, so that they could not be used for any purpose except funerary offerings. The designation of an artifact for mortuary purposes alone, complicates the attempt to attribute it to any given technocomplex. Ethnographic data demonstrate that the distribution of mortuary traits does not conform to the boundaries of culture areas or subareas, as defined by other traits. On the basis of the distribution of the "gray burnished ware" alone, any attempt to claim that the population of the Samaria sites was genetically connected with the "Galilean" population would be premature. As for the comparison between the technology of pot tery from mortuary sites and other components of the Chalcolithic-EB I pottery complexes, the results of this research raise the question whether such wares are valid for the study of the development of ceramic technology. THE SETTLEMENT OF THE HULA VALLEY IN THE URBAN PHASE OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE by Raphael Greenberg (pp. 127-131) The Hula Valley, a fertile, well-watered alluvial plain</page><page sequence="6">106* ENGLISH SUMMARIES surrounded by steep hill-slopes and basaltic outcrops, is worthy of study as an independent unit. Surveys and excavations over the past 65 years have shown the area to be one of dense settlement in the Early Bronze Age II-III. Sites include large towns — Dan (about 200 dunams) and Hazor (150 dunams) — at opposite poles of the settle ment system, and a network of medium-sized (Tel Na'ama, Kh. Khisas, Shamir, Tell Mallaha, Tel Ron) and small sites (Tell Wawiyat, Tel Te'o, Tel Anafa, 'Ein Zagha, Sheikh Muhammad, Tel Hamol, Tel Shahaf) between them. Chronologically, all the sites appear to have coexisted at a time when the characteristic metallic ware of the urban Early Bronze Age was in the vogue, but only a few sites have yielded sherds of Kh. Kerak ware. No sites show evidence of Early Bronze IB occupation. It seems, therefore, that the dense urbanization of the valley took place during Early Bronze II, and did not last long into Early Bronze III. The landscape of the Hula Valley, with its longitudinal division by streams in the north, the central lake and swamp, and the drier southern sector, appears to have dictated the pattern of settlement. There was no central settlement, and the secondary centres between the two major poles (Dan and Hazor) appear to have utilized territories on different sides of the major streams. The estimated aggregate area of habitation in the Hula Valley sites exceeds 500 dunams. This permits a rough population estimate of 10,000 souls. With only 150,000 dunams of available agricultural land in and near the valley, a very high degree of utilization of the agricultural potential of the valley is indicated, far more than any other part of Palestine in this period. This high degree of utilization may help explain the rapid collapse of the Early Bronze Age settlement network, as it left little economic reserve to cope with natural and political catastrophes, of the kind which have affected the valley in historical times. GRAVES AND BURIAL CUSTOMS OF THE MB IIA PERIOD IN GESHER BY Y0SEF GARFINKEL AND RUHAMA B0NFIL (pp. 132-147) The site of Gesher is located in the Central Jordan Valley, 13 km south of the Sea of Galilee. Two seasons of excava tions (1986 and 1987) were conducted at the site, under the supervision of Y. Garfinkel. Remains of an MB IIA cemetery of the early second millennium BCE and of a Pre-Pottery Neolithic A site were unearthed. The MB IIA graves were dug into the earth, probably in the form of shaft tombs, and blocked after burial, so that they were neither robbed nor reused. The skeletal re mains and the offerings were uncovered in their original position. Fourteen graves were systematically excavated. The typical burial practices were: 1. Primary burial (secondary burial was found only in Grave 3). 2. Single burial (two skeletons were found only in Grave 10). 3. The deceased was placed in a flexed position, with the head to the east and the feet to the west (only in Grave 14 was the burial placed with the head to the south and the feet to the north). 4. The offerings, placed next to each deceased, con sisted of two or three pottery vessels and sometimes a bronze object or a perforated bone. All the finds from these graves are shown in the illustra tions, with indications of their location (Ills. 1-6). The finds can be dated to the early stage of MB IIA. The pottery is similar to that of Tell el-Hayyat, Phases 4 and 5, and the Pre-Palace stages at Afeq. The bronze weapons include three duck-bill axes. One radiocarbon date is available: OxA 1955 3640 ± 70 BP ; according to the recent calibration, the date is 2138-1907 BCE, and correlates well with the typological analysis. AN INFANT JAR-BURIAL by Moshe Dothan (pp. 148-151) In the 1984 season of excavations at Tel Akko, an infant burial was found in the ramparts (glacis) of the MB IIA city. The infant, about three months old, was buried in a jar, with a small stone, possibly a fishing weight, beside his skull. The base of the jar is cut away; a small rectangle is incised on the lower part of the jar; its four sides are made of combed parallel lines. Above this rectangle, which recalls a door, there is an incised hieroglyphic inscription: ms mr. One of the possible translations of this inscription is 'child-jar'. The best parallel to the jar and the inscription comes from the coastal site of Tel Ifshar, where such an inscrip tion on a sherd and similar jars were found on an MB IIA floor. The burial in Akko should also be seen in the larger perspective of the city's relations with Egypt. Akko is one of the few Canaanite city-states mentioned in the early Execration Texts and a scarab of Senusret of the Xllth Dynasty was found on the mound. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE IN THE WESTERN NEGEV HIGHLANDS by Mordechai Haiman (pp. 152-166) The present article is based on the findings of a survey conducted in the western Negev highlands by a team under the direction of the author, on behalf of the Archaeological Survey of Israel and the Department of Antiquities. The survey area spans about 450sqkm;</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 107* about 180 sites of the Early Bronze Age were recorded, mostly in an excellent state of preservation. About 20 of the sites were surveyed in the past by Beit-Arieh and Gophna. The settlement pattern in the surveyed area consists of about 80 permanent settlements located near 'Ein el Gudeirat and ־Ein Qadeis, and about 100 satellite settle ments as far as 20 km distant from a water source. The satellite settlements are characterized by large pens and reflect, in the author's opinion, seasonal migrations from the permanent sites in search of grazing areas. The surveyed sites are part of a large distribution of sites in the Negev highlands and Sinai. The survey supports the thesis concerning a series of sites between southern Sinai and Arad, as expressed by Beit-Arieh, Amiran and others. Ceramic artifacts include mainly holemouth jars that cannot be dated precisely and local handmade 'Negebite' pottery. In the author's opinion the settlement in the Negev highlands reflects a large-scale expansion of the Sinai population northwards, probably due to a connection with the southern settled area of Palestine. THE DATE OF THE DOLMENS IN THE GOLAN AND GALILEE — A REASSESSMENT by Lipaz Vinitzky (pp. 167-173) The majority of the dolmens in the region are scattered in the Golan, Galilee and Transjordan. Most scholars ac cept the view that the dolmens in Transjordan were erected in Early Bronze I, and those in the Golan in the Intermediate Bronze Age (EB IV/MB I). A reevaluation of the archaeological evidence leads to the following observations: 1. There is some ceramic evidence for the construction of dolmens in the Golan and Galilee in the Early Bronze Age. 2. Stratigraphic data from the Golan show that the dolmens are later than the Chalcolithic period; the results of the author's excavation in ־Ein Teena — an Interme diate Bronze Age site in the southern Golan — suggest the possibility that at least some of the dolmens were built before the IB. 3. In both Galilee and Golan, there is a clear correla tion between the dispersal of the dolmens and that of the EB II-III sites. On the other hand, in the vicinity of the IB sites of the southern Golan, only shaft tombs, but no dolmens, have been found. 4. Most of the dolmens of the Transjordanian plateau and the eastern Jordan Valley are located near EB sites. We are therefore inclined to date the dolmens of the Golan and Galilee to the Early Bronze Age, probably to EB II-III. However, it is possible that a few dolmens were constructed already in EB I, and that others were erected in the Intermediate Bronze Age. The builders of the dolmens were the inhabitants of the EB towns and vil lages, as well as agro-pastoral groups who lived in close proximity to the main sites. TELL EL-YAHUDIYAH JUGLETS FROM A POTTER'S REFUSE PIT AT AFULA by Uzza Zevulun (pp. 174-190) The significance of the Afula juglets has already been discussed by Ruth Amiran, who also published the first known examples (Ancient Pottery of the Holy Land, Jerusalem 1969, pp. 118-120, Photos 115, 116, 118, 124). Although it has been discussed since then by other scholars, this intriguing assemblage was never fully pub lished. It seems appropriate to present here some of the neglected facts along with new observations. A potter's refuse pit excavated at Afula in June 1950 by E. Ben-Dor has yielded a great variety of local production waste. Beside numerous sherds of ordinary late MB IIA pottery types, the small pit contained also many unfired sherds and at least 36 complete and broken juglets of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware (Ills. 4-7). Dumped more or less together, these 36 discarded juglets form a secure contemporaneous sample large and instructive enough to reveal some early trends and char acteristics of a local branch of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware: 1) An MB IIA range of juglet forms — ovoid bodies, small flattened disc-bases, various types of profiled rims and a distinctive type of collared rim with pinched outer ridge and hollow inner gutter; 2) Typical MB IIA surface treatment — fine horizontal combing visible under the slip all over the body; 3) Range of colours: the Afula juglets can be divided into two groups according to colour resulting from a different firing atmosphere in the kiln: intentionally fired to a yellowish-pink and intentionally fired to a dark brownish-grey; 4) Local range of incised decorations: either horizon tally or vertically-delineated bands filled with straight, diagonal, or zig-zag lines of punctures are the predomi nant motifs. It was further observed that the Afula juglets were produced in three standard sizes, and that a clear correla tion existed between the size of a juglet and the order of its decoration. All the large juglets were decorated with horizontal designs (Ills. 2, 5, 8, 12-22), while the me dium- and small-sized juglets were decorated with verti cal designs (Ills. 3, 9-12, 23-26). POTTERY VESSELS VERSUS LAMPS: IDENTITY OF FASHIONING by Varda Sussman (pp. 191-196) Based on the study of technological progress and other influences, a basic typological frame for Palestinian pot</page><page sequence="8">108* ENGLISH SUMMARIES tery was established by Ruth Amiran. This paper at tempts to show the close connection or identity between potters making vessels and those making lamps. In the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age I ordinary small bowls are identified as lamps by the soot marks on the rims. In EBII, EB III and EBIV the technique used to form the indented ledge handle was also used to make wick-rests on bowls to form lamps (111. 1:1, 2, 3, 12). The change to the folded 'envelope' ledge handle (111. 1:5) of the EB MB period resulted in the four-spouted lamps (Ills. 1:6, 7). Adopted also on vessels, the wick-rest now resembles spouts of jars (Ills. 1:6, 7, 13, 14, 15) In MB II, pinching served to form the lip both of juglets and jugs as well as of lamps (Ills. 1:16, 17,18,19). In the Late Bronze Age there is a marked change: deeper pinching, together with pressing the rim downards, created a triangular spout (111. 1:20) and the everted rim (111. 1:21) gave better support. The wick-rest became funnel-shaped (Ills. 1:21, 23), giving the wick additional support and protection, like the later closed nozzle. At first, the lamp style was not affected in the Israelite period. The typology was based on the change in the rim profiles (Ills. 2:1,2,3,4). The marked change came in the 8th century BCE with the separation between southern and northern lamp-styles. Southern lamps had heavy discs of two types: disk-like (111.2:8) or core-like (111. 2:10). There are almost no parallels in other vessels, except some bowls (111. 2:5) and some crude Negebite pottery. These lamps may have been placed on cooking pots and jars, both to raise the light source and to serve as stoppers, as indicated by the numerous surviving disks of such lamps (Ills. 2:2, 6, 7, 9). In the Persian period, the profiles were carinated (111. 2:13), and the light-coloured clay was well-fired. The flat bases were knife-pared in the Cypriote manner, used in Palestine mainly on lamps in the Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, Persian and Herodian periods. Their wide distribution in the Mediterranean area may point to a Cypriote origin. The western concept of closing the lamps, with a chamber for the oil and a nozzle for the wick (111. 2:12) is reminiscent of Negebite pots of the Early Iron Age (111. 2:11). The same idea was tried in a different way in Palestine already in the Early Iron Age, repeated in the Hasmonean Hellenistic lamps (111. 2:16). Owing to the similarity of the production methods of the lamps and the vessels, the lamp can be used as a chronological dating factor. THE EXCAVATIONS AT TEL BETH-SHEAN IN 1989-1990 by Amihai Mazar (pp. 197-211) The excavations at Tel Beth-Shean were resumed in 1989 on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, as part of the large-scale Beth-Shean archaeo logical project sponsored by the Beth-Shean Tourist De velopment Administration. The excavations are planned as a direct continuation of the University of Pennsyl vania's excavations which ended in 1933. The sacred area, where the previous expedition had stopped work in the Stratum IX level, was chosen as the main area for the new excavations (Area R). The work in 1989 and 1990 made possible a review of the stratigraphy from the late third millennium until the 14th century BCE. A thin occupation layer of the EBIV/MB I period, probably the remains of a seasonal settlement, was revealed above EB III levels. There is a gap in MB IIA, while the MB IIB/C is represented by an occupation layer in which a wide open area with ovens and cooking installations was exposed. The main effort was devoted to investigating the LB I levels. In Phase R3, dated to LB IA, a temple was uncov ered below the courtyard of the Stratum IX sacred area. The temple is a modest tripartite building, with a unique asymmetrical plan.The building underwent several modi fications until it was abandoned, and its area levelled by an artificial fill. The following phase (R2), dated to LB IIB, can be identified as the earlier phase of the Stratum IX sacred area. New buildings were constructed, and the finds include Egyptian pottery vessels, attesting to the Egyp tian presence at Beth-Shean during that time. Phase Rl, which is identical with Rowe's Stratum IX, is a modifica tion of the previous phase. It probably dates from the 14th century BCE. Iron Age I strata were investigated on the peak of the mound. A late 11th century BCE destruction level was identified, probably corresponding to the lower Stratum V of the previous excavations. METALWORKING IN THE CENTRAL JORDAN VALLEY AT THE TRANSITION FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE IRON AGE by Ora Negbi (pp. 212-225) In a paper published in 1968, Pritchard demonstrated that Sea Peoples were responsible for the metallurgical activity that emerged in the central Jordan Valley in the late 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. Pritchard's sug gestion has been strongly supported recently (1988) by Tubb, who maintains that substantial archaeological data indicate that early groups of Sea Peoples had already established themselves at Beth-Shean, Tell es־Sa'idiyeh and Tell Deir 'Alia several decades before 1200 BCE. Reevaluation of both old and new data from these sites leads us to the following conclusions: a) There are no diagnostic data for the presence of intrusive Aegean elements in the central Jordan Valley at</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 109* the close of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. On the other hand there are clear indications that at that time Egyptian strongholds expanded beyond the Beth-Shean Valley to include key sites in the Succoth Valley, such as Tell es-Sayidiyeh and Tell Deir Allah. b) The strong Egyptian affinities attested in the ceme teries of the residencies of Beth-Shean, and the temples of Beth-Shean and Tell Deir Alia, seem to coincide with the intensification of Egyptian control in southern Canaan in the late 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. c)The population of Tell Deir Alia and Tell es Saidiyeh at that date was substantially similar to that of other major Canaanite sites in the Beth-Shean and Jez reel Valleys. Archaeological remains indicate, however, that the local elite adopted Egyptian burial customs and used Egyptianized luxury goods. d)The rich assemblages of metal artifacts recorded from the cemeteries of Beth-Shean and Tell es-Saidiyeh include Egyptian vessels and their Canaanite imitations, as well as distinctive types of stands and other luxury items that were produced in the major bronzeworking centres of the Levantine coast and Cyprus. e) The hiatus which followed the collapse of Egyptian domination in Canaan, does not necessarily imply that new ethnic elements were introduced into the central Jordan Valley in the mid-12th century BCE. It seems more likely that the semi-nomadic groups who used the smelting installations at Tell Deir Alia in the late 12th and 11th centuries BCE, were the direct successors of local metalworking experts who had been employed by the Egyptians in the 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. Consequently, we cannot accept Tubb's claim that "It was surely these craftsmen, inheritors of bronze-working which was ultimately Sea Peoples in origin, who provided the skills for Hiram's great casting operations in the 'clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan' in the 1 Oth cen tury BCE". NEW ASPECTS OF POTTERY FIGURINES IN THE YARMUKIAN CULTURE by Tamar Νου (pp. 226-232) The Yarmukian figurines dating from the sixth millen nium BCE include broad pottery figurines consisting of a cylindrical core to which the head and limbs were added, and narrow types, as well as limestone figurines. The stone figurines have been found in great numbers at Sha'ar Hagolan. Most of the iconographic details have been extensively discussed by Mozel (1974), Perrot (1966) and Noy (1978). The broad type figurines are the most common and had a wide geographical distribution. The broad types include mostly female and some male figurines, while the narrow types found up to the present only at H. Minha are all male. The garment, the unique shape of the eyes (probably grain-shaped), the elongated head or hat, the hairdress and earring, all belong to the repertoire of the broad figurine types, as well as to some of the narrow types. This iconography is well-known from the figurines found at Neolithic sites in Syria, Lebanon, Anatolia and northwest Iran. However, the Anatolian figurines have a different iconographical representation, mainly of the face and head, probably due to differences in the symbolic lan guage. These differences may be due to a different cul tural approach or to environmental boundaries. EB AND MB I BOARD GAMES IN CANAAN AND THE ORIGIN OF THE EGYPTIAN SENET GAME by Michael Sebbane (pp. 233-238) A large group of game boards made of chalk was discover ed in EBII strata at Arad (perhaps starting as early as EB I). Isolated similar boards are known from other southern Canaanite sites: Bab edh-Dhra (EB II-III), Har Yeruljam, Mash'abe Sade, 'En Ziq and Kh. Iskander (MB I). Seven different games were observed, with 16x2, 14x2, llxl, 7x4, 10x4, 10x2, 10x3 fields. The latter is the most widespread locally and is well known in Egypt from at least the Illrd Dynasty until the end of the Roman period. The game is documented in Egypt in texts and wall paintings; its name — senet — and some of its rules are known. Against this background, the large EB II (i.e. Ist-IInd Dynasty) group of Arad game boards may be surprising. Three alternative explanations suggest themselves: 1) the senet game originated in southern Canaan in EB II (or EBI); 2) the senet game originated in Egypt, and its absence from pre-IIIrd Dynasty contexts is merely acci dental, perhaps to be remedied by future discoveries; 3) the "simple" 10x3 game is the original version, early examples of which appear for the time being only in southern Canaan, but it may have been known in the ancient Near East. From this game, and continuing side by side with it, the Egyptian senet game was developed, with its added religious and funerary aspects. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOUNDINGS AT DHAHR MIRZBANEH by Israel Finkelstein (pp. 239-248) Dhahr Mirzbaneh is a long and narrow rocky spur on the desert fringe, near 'Ein Samiya. In 1963/64 P.W. Lapp excavated an Intermediate Bronze Age cemetery on the</page><page sequence="10">110* ENGLISH SUMMARIES Dhahr Mirzbaneh ridge. Another group of Intermediate Bronze shaft-tombs was excavated in 1970 near Kh. Sa miya, south of the Dhahr Mirzbaneh ridge. One of these tombs yielded the 'Ein Samiya silver cup. The area was re-examined in the course of the Land of Ephraim survey and remains of an Intermediate Bronze Age site were traced on the Dhahr Mirzbaneh spur. It consists of a large rectangular tumulus at its northern end, and an oblong enclosure extending from the tumulus southwards. Traces of buildings or pens were discerned within the boundaries of the enclosure. Bedrock, with a significant number of cup-marks, is exposed on the spine of the spur. Following the survey, a short excavation was carried out at the site in 1987. During the excavation all the cemeter ies of the region were mapped and the tombs counted. The tumulus is a rectangular structure, consisting of two concentric stepped rectangles, measuring 30 χ 23 m, and rising about 5 m above the area around it. The layout of the cemeteries (see below), and its central position on the site, suggest the importance of the tumulus as a high place, or as the tomb of a "great man". The "enclosure", about 140 χ 70 m in size (ca. 8 dunams), conforms to the shape of the spur. Two areas adjoining the peripheral wall were excavated. In Area A the work revealed the original boundary wall of the site and traces of buildings adjacent to it. A large quantity of Intermediate Bronze Age pot tery, mainly storage jars, was recovered. The Intermediate Bronze Age site of Jebel Qa'aqir in the upper Shephelah presents a somewhat similar picture to that of the site of Dhahr Mirzbaneh. Dever described a settlement site on a ridge, possibly surrounded by an enclosure wall. At the west end of the ridge there is a rocky plateau with a few "standing stones". On the slopes of the ridge there are four cemeteries with about 150 tombs. Three hundred shaft-tombs, in three concentrations, were counted in past investigations of the Intermediate Bronze Age cemeteries in the vicinity of 'Ein Samiya. About 90 of them were excavated. In the course of the Land of Ephraim survey it was realized that additional concentrations of tombs had been found and robbed by the nearby villagers in recent years. Therefore we mapped the different cemeteries during the excavation and counted the tombs. Eight cemeteries were recorded; four are hewn on the slopes of the Dhahr Mirzbaneh spur, almost encircling the site. Altogether, 1100 shaft-tombs were recorded — the largest Intermediate Bronze Age cemetery in the country. The Intermediate Bronze Age population of the vicini ty of Dhahr Mirzbaneh was apparently composed of varied elements — few permanent settlers, and pastoral groups which were attracted to the area by its ecologi cal advantages. It seems that the site became a central (sacred?) cemetery for the inhabitants of a large area in the hill country and the steppe. It was a convenient place in the middle of the seasonal east-west movement rou tine, located near a rich water source and fertile agricul tural land. A GROUP OF FIGURINES AND MINIATURE VESSELS OF THE CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD by Miriam Tadmor (pp. 249-258) The group published here forms a welcome addition to the corpus of ceramic representations from the Chalco lithic period. Of the seven items one is a figurine of an animal, which once carried some object on its back. Six are attachments to some composite object (or objects), now lost: two are bird-shaped, one represents a horned animal and another is shaped like a pair of horns. In addition, the group comprises a churn and cup, both miniatures. Petrographic analyses of the horns and the cup indicate that both were produced of identical clays, probably in the Beersheva valley or in the northern Shephelah. Stylis tic analysis also indicates the homogeneity of the whole group, which may have been produced in one workshop. The seven objects are described and stylistically re viewed in the context of contemporary ceramic art. However, the Chalcolithic corpus of pottery known to date does not provide a clue to the shape of the composite vessels. With the exception of the churn, the five minia tures were once attached to some object, but without any connection to its interior, so that they could not have been part of a kernos. A high-footed bowl from an ossuary tomb at Azor, which has a tiny cup attached to its interior is mentioned in this context. The ornate copper crown from the Judean Desert Treasure with its numer ous attachments and the pottery "bird-cups" from a tomb at Palmahim, are also pertinent examples of composite shapes. The present group promises well for the discovery in future of new shapes to be added to the corpus of composite Chalcolithic objects.</page></plain_text>
