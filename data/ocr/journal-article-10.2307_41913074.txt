<plain_text><page sequence="1">[1] 139 ON A TERRACOTTA FIGURINE FROM UCH KULAKH (BUKHARA OASIS) The wealth of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic baked-clay images hou- sed in Central Asian museums testifies to the fortune that in ancient times coro- plastics enjoyed all over Transoxiana. As a matter of fact, from the 3rd-2nd cen- turies BC up to the 5th century AD circa - that is from the Hellenistic period up to the eve of the Early Medieval cultural blooming1 - terracotta figurines represent a major source for the study of the religious beliefs and, in general, of the artistic production of pre-Islamic Central Asia. This is particularly true for Sogdiana, as no examples of monumental sculpture or painting (with the only exception of the Erkurgan fragments) can be dated to this long period. Praiseworthy attempts have been made to put order in the huge amount of Central Asian terracottas. This is by no means an easy task, as the largest part of the material is formed by stray finds (only a relatively meagre percentage of the figurines comes from reliable stratigraphie contexts). Nonetheless scholars have tried to build up typologie classifications which, due to the scantiness or even the lack of firm chronological landmarks (this is the case, for instance, of the Afrasiab terracottas, which represent the bulk of Sogdian coroplastics)2, are necessarily based upon iconographie and stylistic grounds. Such are the cri- teria of the classifications worked out by G.A. Pugačenkova for the clay figuri- nes from Margiana and Bactria, by M.G. Vorob eva for Chorasmian terracottas and, above all, by V.A. Meškeris for the rich coroplastic repertory that Sogdia has so far generously yielded, her Koroplastika Sogda (1977) and Sogdijskaja ter- rakota (1989) being perhaps the most notable efforts towards a comprehensive analysis of this production. Yet there are still substantial problems to be solved. Both the iconogra- 1 We shall set aside the Bronze Age coroplastics, abundantly attested especially in Mar- giana. 2 There are, of course, a few exceptions, such as, for example, the clay figurines from Dalverzin Tepe or Kara Tepe, in Bactria, and those from Erkurgan, in Sogdia.</page><page sequence="2">140 Ciro Lo Muzio [2] phic and stylistic approaches are sometimes not very rigorous3 and a priori schemata are given overwhelming weight. This seems to be case with the postu- lation of a "Hellenistic" phase within this production, a phase which, according to several scholars, is represented almost throughout Central Asia. However, as we remarked above, no stratigraphie finds are known from this epoch and a "Hellenistic" date for a certain amount of Margian, Bactrian and Sogdian terra- cottas is inferred from their "Western" attire and from the naturalistic rende- ring of their physiognomy and stance. Such an assumption is not as obvious as it may seem if we remember that the persistence or even a later spread of Clas- sical iconographie and stylistic patterns up to the first centuries AD is a well at- tested phenomenon from the Parthian empire to Gandhara. The fact that the Greek town of Ai Khanum yielded almost no Hellenistic coroplastics4 makes the presumption of a "Hellenistic phase" in Central Asian coroplastics even more conjectural.

From a religious viewpoint, the analysis of these figurines still has many a point to clarify. A conspicuous amount of Central Asian terracottas represent 3 See Grenet's (1991) and Staviskij's (Stavisky 1996) reviews of Meskeris 1977 and 1989. 4 The clay figurines found in the town can be safely ascribed to the Kushan epoch, see Abdul- laev 1996.</page><page sequence="3">[3] On a terracotta figurine from Uch Kulakh 141 female figures, all of which are considered to portrait a local goddess, characte- rised, in the various regions, by a specific attire and attribute (when she holds one). Unfortunately there are no local written sources apt to shed light onto the identity of these deities and there are no iconographie analogies we could point out between them and the deities depicted on Kushan coinage, on the one hand, and with those occurring in early Medieval painting, on the other. Mo- reover there seem to be no grounds to relate them with anyone of the goddesses described in Mazdean literature; in particular, as rightly suggested by Lelekov (1985) and Pugačenkova (1992: 51), the hypothesis that part of these figurines may represent the Iranian water goddess Anahita should be definitely abando- ned. All things considered, we are not in a position to give a name to any of the Bactrian, Margian, Chorasmian and Sogdian goddesses. To the manifold repertory sketched above we can now add a further piece of evidence, which is the main subject of our short notes. During the 1998 Uz- bek-Italian excavation campaign in the site of Uch Kulakh (Bukhara)5, a baked red-clay statuette depicting a female figure (height: 10 cm; width 3,5 cm) was brought to light (fig. la-b). It is integrally preserved, although the relief is ra- ther worn. The figure was most probably moulded, the back side being left flat. She is represented as standing in a frontal position. The head is disproportio- nally large with regard to the rest of the body. Her voluminous hair-dress is rendered with parallel oblique diverging lines and tied with a narrow band or a diadem over the forehead (a circular motif above the right temple might repre- sent an ornament). She has oval face with small chin, large almond (almost rhomboid) eyes with eyelids and pupils in strong relief; a protuberance in the middle of the forehead might be what remains of an ornament or tattoo; nose and lips are much worn. Her neck is adorned with a pearl necklace within two plain fillets; she wears a mantle with waist-belt, below which it falls with regular parallel folds; the "V" shaped opening is decorated by a double row of pearls; feet and arms are not indicated. Let us now try to give the Uch Kulakh statuette a place in the multifarious scenery of Central Asian terracotta goddesses. To begin with, the circumstan- ces of its finding (a stratigraphical context seriously disturbed by one of the many pit-holes dug in the Islamic period) deprive us of any chronological clue. Therefore we are bound to resort to the iconographie criterium, which, on the other hand, provides interesting results. Our statuette, in fact, seems not to match anyone of the well-established types of Sogdian terracotta goddesses. Their attire - often a tunic covered by a long mantle - is profusely ornamented and they very often hold an attribute (a 5 See Silvi Antonini (in print).</page><page sequence="4">142 Ciro Lo Muzio [4] fruit, a cup, a branch or a wheat-ear); the general stylistic treatment is also quite different. A few moulded terracotta figurines were also unearthed in the Vara- khsha area; a group of them, representing one and the same subject (although by means of different moulds), were found at Ayak Tepe 2 (fig. 2)6. All of them represent a female figure wearing a folded tunic and a pearl necklace, resting her right hand on the womb; however both in the general rendering and in the iconographie details there is almost nothing in common our terracotta; the dif- ference is particularly evident if we compare the sharp, almost plastic physio- gnomic traits (head and face) of the Ayak Tepe figurines with the flatness of our statuette. Fig. 2 - Terracotta figurines from Ayak Tepe 2 (after Culture and Art of Ancient Uzbeki- stan , I, Moscow 1991). We do not find closer analogies in Margiana, where female figurines (usually holding a cup or a mirror) are dressed in long tunics which are either richly draped or literally covered with impressed circles. No direct comparisons can be pointed out in a series of clay female figurines from the middle Amu Da- rya (Košelenko [ed.], 1985: tab. CVI), nor do we find similarities in the reper- tory of "Chorasmian goddesses", which in their attire, physiognomy and attri- butes represent in their turn a peculiar tradition (Vorobeva 1981). Unexpecte- dly enough the Uch Kulakh goddess finds closer analogies in the Bactrian re- pertory of female statuettes, namely among the terracottas unearthed at Dalver- zin Tepe. As for the dress, we may compare our statuette to the lute-player 6 See Šiškin 1963: fig. 73, and Abdullaev et alii (eds.) 1991: I, figs. 247-248.</page><page sequence="5">[5] On a terracotta figurine from Uch Kulakh 143 found in the house DT-6 (fig. 3)7; in fact the lower part of the girted mantle is rendered in a very similar fashion (straight parallel folds); we may compare also the high arched hair-dress with radial lines above the forehead, the oval face with pointed chin, the almond eyes with thick eyelids, an ornament or tattoo in the middle of the forehead. Also in another female figurine (fig.4), unearthed in a small shrine (DT-9) within the potters' quarter, the mantle falls down in strai- ght parallel folds below the waist, moreover it shows a "V" opening; in this case, however, the figure wears also a "himation" , the lower part of which is vi- sible below the thick-bordered lower hem of the mantle. The hair is rendered with radiant lines above the forehead and with straight vertical lines on both si- des of the face; the forehead shows a flower-like (?) ornament or tattoo.

We think that the similarities between the Dalverzin Tepe terracottas and the statuette from Uch Kulakh are significant enough as to authorize the hypo- thesis that the latter might have been manufactured in Bactria and that, in some 7 A mould depicting the same figure was found in the town outskirts: Pugačenkova 1978: 62, n. 41; Pugačenkova (ed.) 1991: n. 66.</page><page sequence="6">144 Ciro Lo Muzio [6] way, it reached the Sogdian site. What is particularly interesting from an archa- eological viewpoint is that, according to the chronology proposed by Pugačen- kova, the Dalverzin terracottas date to the lst-2nd centuries AD. The attribu- tion of the Uch Kulakh statuette to the same chronological span - that we may cautiously extend to the 3rd century - would represent (together with the fin- ding of a coin of the Kushan king Vasudeva) an interesting hint pointing to a much earlier settlement than the Early Medieval fort we are at present bringing to light. A hypothesis that the prosecution of the excavation may confirm. Ciro Lo Muzio</page><page sequence="7">[7] On a terracotta figurine from Uch Kulakh 145 References Abdullaev, K.
