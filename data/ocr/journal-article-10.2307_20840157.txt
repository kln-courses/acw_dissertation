<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME REMARKS ON AL-FARABFS VIEWS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION YASIN CEYLAN Al-Farabi's position on the relationship between philosophy and religion can be extracted from his theories of knowledge and prophecy. In both theories he relies on Greek sources. However, his eclectic approach to the formulation of doctrines and sensitivity to Islamic factors provide some distinct characteristics to his views. In his theory of knowledge al-Farabi divides intellect first into two categories: human and superhuman. The human intellect, while not in use, is called potential intellect, and when in use, is called acquired intellect. In order to get the latter status, there is a need for a contact between the potential intellect and the superhuman intellect which he also calls the Active Intellect. Since no potential power goes into operation by itself except by an external intervention, thus, for any proposition made on intellectual level, and above the material implications of representative faculty, there is a necessary cooperation of the human and superhuman intellects.1 This superhuman intellect or the Active Intellect is identical with the tenth Intel ligence of Plotinian Emanationist Theory. In this theory, ten Intelligences descend from the First, in a hierarchy one coming after the other, each being caused by the one prior to itself. This sequence terminates at the tenth, which after having lost much of its divine quality is not competent enough to give rise to an eleventh intelligence. It is yet above the material world and supervises the affairs of the sub-lunar world.2 The Active Intellect is the source of intelligibles. Since general con cepts are not associated in anyway with the particulars, an external source for these notions which occur in the mind is necessary. This source is also the centre for the unity of intellection experienced by all human beings. Now this very source, namely the Active Intellect, whose contact is</page><page sequence="2">78 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 1 required for any conceptual or theoretical knowledge is, at the same time, the source of prophetic knowledge. By ascribing the two types of knowledge to the same source, al-Farabi reduces the prophetic knowledge to the sphere of human knowledge and provides an explanation for it. As most prophets are not intellectually trained, the theoretical knowledge granted to them is not of the kind a philosopher attains after discursive thinking, whereby he accomplishes synthesis between universal concepts. The locus for the emergence of true knowledge in prophets is the faculty of representation. However, this faculty stores only images of material objects, and subjects them to synthetical and analytical processes. Thus, it does not accommodate intelligibles which have nothing to do with the material existence, and are the only tools for constructing meaningful statements. Then, how to relate a prophet's mind, which while lacking a trained intellectual disposition, possesses a powerful imagination with those indispensable intelligibles? The answer al-Farabi offers to this question is that the intelligibles take on various imaginary shapes in the faculty of representation so that they become understandable to the prophet as well as to the masses who are instructed in a picture-language reflecting the image-formulations of intelligibles in the mind of the prophet.3 But what is the truth-value of these statements in symbolic language? Are they to be taken at their face value, or interpreted so that the implied meaning is in line with the statements comprising intelligibles? Moreover, are the prophets who receive those messages and express them in picture-lan guage acquintant with their abstract (statements made of intelligibles) coun terparts, or not? If they are, why do they not also articulate them through intelligibles so that the enlightened people can also take their due share of the message and fully appreciate it? If, on the other hand, the prophet is destitute of the meaning of the message in conceptual form, then how can he be considered to be in full grasp of reality? To avoid such difficulties the Spinozian stance on the issue is worth consideration. Spinoza is of the opinion that the prophets and scriptures, as the record of their speeches, do not expound philosophical truth, they ex pound rather guidelines for the actions and manners of human beings. Thus, a prophet's mission is not to teach his people the nature of things which is handled by the theoretical reason.4 This reminds one of Luther's remark about the nature of the knowledge the Bible contains. "The Bible is dark enough for souls that long and seek to know more."5 It remains that what prophets preach are the necessary precepts for good conduct and right deeds, so that man can lead a better life and a meaningful existence in this world. And for such an aim there is no need</page><page sequence="3">YASIN CEYLAN/Al-Farabi's Views on Philosophy and Religion 79 for the synthetic formulations of the theoretical reason, both in sciences and in philosophy. Since the principles believed in, for any right action is not a matter to be fully examined and evaluated by the theoretical reason, their truth is taken for granted in absolute sense. These principles are in a sense, postulates of practical reason in Kant's moral philosophy. According to Kant, there is a need for three postulates to be believed by anyone who wants to lead a consistent moral life. They are human freedom, immortality of the soul, and God's existence.6 Nevertheless, none of these can be ration ally proved. For they are not matters to be perceived by the sensibility and transferred to the understanding so that they can become the subject of a judgment given in accordance with the fixed categories. Nor are they like mathematical concepts reconstructable in the physical world. They are rather matters for belief. Thus, man faces the precarious situation of believing in something as absolutely true, while not knowing exactly whether he is jus tified in this belief. As the truth-value of these three postulates can never be demonstrated by the theoretical reason, they can only be associated with the practical reason which should not seek epistemic certainty for its rules, maxims or postulates. If the prophets are only emphasizing what are related to the practical reason, leaving the domain of the theoretical reason to the natural develop ments of man's intellectual abilities, then two things gain importance. First, theoretical truth is not to be included in the prophetic mission. Second, their teachings involve all men at any level of intellectual training, whether they are illiterate peasants or learned scholars. Because both are predisposed to act morally and the ostensible advantage of the scholar is not in the realm of practical reason but in that of the theoretical. Al-Farabi's contention that the allegorical language of the scripture addresses the uneducated masses who take these scriptural statements at their face value, should not then express the truths of the theoretical reason, as they are only aimed at guiding man's moral conducts.7 Therefore, the implied meanings these statements stand for, which can only be com prehended by wise men, should not differ considerably from the allegorical, since their interpretation cannot render them into theoretical propositions. They will still remain maxims or postulates of the practical reason, the full comprehension of which is impossible for the theoretical reason. Then what is the use of interpreting such metaphorical expressions, if even their implied meanings are not explicable through rational demonstration? As an illustra tion, Muslim philosophers' denial of bodily resurrection can be given. The philosophers, while rejecting bodily revival as contrary to reason accepted spiritual resurrection as rationally demonstrable. Whereas, the immortality of the soul is equally undemonstrable by the theoretical reason. This reason ing is true of God's existence too. By rejecting the anthropomorphic descrip</page><page sequence="4">80 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 1 tions used for God in scriptures divine existence is not rendered rationally justified. But there is a case for the philosopher with regard to such maxims or postulates which involve morality only and cannot be fully known but believed in. If the defenders of such beliefs claim that the truth of these beliefs can be rationally demonstrated it is the duty of the philosopher to say that it cannot. For, here there is a mistake being committed against the methodology which treats the truth of the propositions of the theoretical reason and those of the practical differently. The mixing of these two categories causes insurmountable difficulties. It seems that al-Farabfs theory that there is a need for an allegorical language addressed to the laity, so that the truth in the scriptures is brought nearer to their understanding, does not hold if what is expressed by this language is a philosophical truth. Because in that case even metaphors will not help make abstract notions easier for the common people. On the other hand, what will be the benefit of instructing masses about things which are not suitable for their comprehension and will have no effect on their conduct, due to the qualities of which they are apt to be happy or unhappy. Thus, the Spinozian account that the philosophical truth is different from that of religion and that the former should not be searched for in scriptures puts us in a more advantageous position for the solution of the problem.8 If the main purpose in the scriptural knowledge is to induce men towards moral acts, then such beliefs should not be brought under philosophi cal scrutiny as to whether they are verifiable or not. They should rather be treated like the Kantian postulates of practical reason. However, has a philosopher no say in such matters? Or, are all beliefs for the moral conduct of man the same in value, however they may differ from each other? If they are not, then the question of which belief is good for which moral act arises. For, not all beliefs are conducive to right deeds. This aspect of the issue naturally concerns a philosopher, as it does any intellectual who desires the well-being of mankind. One of the important things to be considered while evaluating the relationship between belief and act is that any such belief should not be assessed independent of act which is its fruit. Because there is no other criterion on which a belief (involving moral conduct) can be judged as to its value for man. To do this, it is wiser to proceed from acts towards beliefs but not vice versa. If this rule is not observed, injustice will be done to many beliefs and the systems they are part of, while many unworthy beliefs will be regarded as worthwhile only because they look more consistent and somewhat rationally integrated.</page><page sequence="5">YASIN CEYLAN/Al-Farabi's Views on Philosophy and Religion 81 ^bu Nasr al-Farabi, Al-Farabi on the Perfect City, trans, and comments by Richard Waltzer (Oxford, 1985), p. 203. 2Ibid. pp. 105-107. 3Ibid. pp. 221-225. 4Benedict de Spinoza, A Theolo&amp;co-Poluical Treatise (New York, 1951), p. 190. 5W.T.
