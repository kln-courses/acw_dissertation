<plain_text><page sequence="1">SWEAT OF THE SUN AND TEARS OF THE MOON. GOLD AND SILVER IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ART, by Andr6 Emmerich. Pp. xxiii + 216, figs. 222, frontis. and pls. 3 in color, bibliog., index. University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1965. $15.00. The poetic main title of this book is taken from an Inca legend which calls gold and silver "the sweat of the sun and the tears of the moon." This is a compre- hensive work in which the author has brought together for the first time most of what is at present known about pre-Columbian gold and silver of all areas and all periods. The color plates and other reproductions of important objects in this lavishly illustrated book are of excellent quality. Included at the end are 22 figures taken from the Florentine Codex, the encyclo- pedic summary of Aztec civilization compiled between 1558 and 1569 by Fray Bernardino de Sahaguin. The author appropriately begins with a discussion of the goldwork of the various cultures in the Peru- vian region, for the earliest pre-Columbian gold ob- jects of artistic merit appear to have been produced during the time of the Chavin culture (1200-400 B.c.). Gold was the only metal known to this culture, and the only techniques were hammering, annealing, and soldering. All the objects were produced in sheet gold, many with intricate repouss6 designs, and objects of fine quality were produced in spite of the simple tech- niques. His discussion includes brief accounts of the circumstances of discovery of some of the important gold objects ascribed to this culture. Emmerich merely mentions the products of the various local cultures that followed the end of the Chavin culture and continued into the first century B.c. In discussing the goldwork of Peru from about the first century B.c. until about A.D. 900, his opinion is that the products of the Nazca culture of the south coast show little or no technical improvement over those of the earlier cultures. On the other hand, the gold and silver objects produced by the Mochica peo- ple of the north coast showed considerable technical as well as artistic advance, for they were able to melt gold and other metals, to make alloys, and to cast objects by the cire-perdue method. He devotes a short chapter to the objects in the so-called Tiahuanaco style of the southern highlands which became evident from about A.D. 8oo to about IIoo. Because such a large number of gold and silver objects have come down to us from the extensive Chimui realm, the author rightly devotes considerable space to a discussion of the metalwork of the period from about IIoo to about 1450. Though many of the objects of this period are not of high artistic merit, most of them show the practice of a high degree of craftsmanship or even virtuosity in the working of metals. In the opinion of the author, the production of some of these objects would tax the skill of modern workers, even with the advantage of modern tools. Relatively few objects in precious metals have come down to us from the last and highest culture of ancient Peru, the Inca civilization. Not one of the vast num- ber of objects taken away by the Spanish is known to have escaped the melting pot. Although the author is of the opinion that the objects discovered by excava- tion provide a good picture of the quality of Inca art and craftsmanship, a reasonable doubt must exist on this point because some of the largest and finest ob- jects, as is evident from the descriptions of Pizarro, were carried off by the conquistadors. The author devotes a short chapter to the metalwork of Ecuador, one unusual feature of which was the production of finely wrought miniature objects. Still more unusual was the use of platinum combined with gold for the manufacture of such objects. Other tech- nical achievements were the production of gold wire by drawing and the use of a kind of gold plating on base metal. Four chapters are devoted to a discussion of the metalwork of Colombia. In view of the small amount of scientific excavation that has been carried out in this region so far, there is considerable uncertainty about the periods of the early cultures of Colombia and their relationships to contemporary cultures in other areas. However, it seems reasonably certain that objects in the so-called Calima style were produced in an early period of considerable duration. At first they were made only in hammered gold, but later, intricate gold pins and ornaments of fine style were made by casting a gold-copper alloy. In the opinion of the author the remarkable figu- rines, urns, and other objects produced by the Quim- baya people, who still occupied the middle Cauca valley at the time of the Conquest, represent the high point in the handling of gold as a material for sculp- ture in pre-Columbian America. Instead of fashioning objects from thin sheet gold, as was the usual practice</page><page sequence="2">216 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 71 in the early cultures of Colombia and Peru, the gold- smiths of the Quimbaya produced only cast objects of massive gold, some of the largest of which weigh as much as four pounds. The production of both large and small objects in the admirable Quimbaya style must have required the highest degree of technical skill in the casting of gold and alloys of gold. As shown by the examples illustrated and discussed by the author, the objects produced by the local cul- tures of the north coast and flood plains of northern Colombia differ remarkably from each other in style and technique. The curious abstract anthropomorphic pendants of the Darien goldsmiths, often produced by a combination of techniques, differ radically from the delicate filigree earrings and small figurines cast by the goldsmiths of the Sinu region. Different again are the cast objects of the Tairona culture, which in style show a strong Quimbaya influence. Because the cul- ture of the Muisca states is strongly emphasized in the early Spanish accounts, the goldwork of the Muisca culture was long thought to be the most important one in Colombia. It is now recognized that the gold ob- jects of this culture are generally more primitive in style than those of the other Colombian cultures. One characteristic of these objects is their dull or rough finish resulting from the use of an inferior technique in casting. The author next discusses gold objects from the Panama peninsula, beginning with those found at Venado Beach and at Sitio Conte in Coclk province. Most of his discussion deals with the fine and varied goldwork of Cocl6. One specialty of the goldsmiths of this province was the setting of gold jewelry with precious stones and with less valuable ornamental ma- terials. An entire chapter is devoted to objects from the Veraguas, Chiriqui, and Diquis regions, which are so similar in style that they may be considered as having been produced by the same general culture. Although these objects cannot be assigned definite dates, they probably all belong to a relatively late period that ended with the Conquest. Only a few locally manufactured objects of gold have been found in Costa Rica, probably because gold was very scarce in that country. Imported gold objects in the Quimbaya, Cocl6, and other styles have been identified in the few excavations that have so far been made. The author discusses last the goldwork of pre-Co- lumbian Mexico, beginning with the Mayan region. All the gold objects found in this region were im- ported, or less probably were made from imported metal, for gold does not occur there. This is a fortu- nate circumstance from the standpoint of indicating trade relationships. On the basis of the style of the gold objects found in this region, the bulk of them came from the Panama peninsula. Most of the chapter on the goldwork of the Mayan region deals with the finds at Chichin Itzfi. In general, metallurgy was a late development in the rest of Mexico. According to Aztec legends the working of metals was introduced by the Toltecs, and archaeological evidence tends to support this. The oldest gold objects of Mexican manufacture have been found in connection with plumbate ware, which was made in the period from about A.D. 9oo to about 1250. These early objects were formed by hammering sheet gold. Casting and other sophisticated techniques first appeared in the Tarascan region of Michoacan in western Mexico or in the Mixtec region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. The Mixtecs produced delicate and complicated gold objects as shown particularly by the finds at Monte Albain and very recently by the finds near the town of Zaachila, Oaxaca. As compared to the large number of objects carried off and melted down by the Spanish conquerors, few Aztec objects survive to inform us directly of the quality of their goldwork. Fortunately, various early Spanish accounts supply much information about the high state of the art of goldworking in the Aztec empire. The technology of mining, of smelting ores, and of working metals and alloys is discussed in the last chapter. Some information on mining and smelting is contained in accounts of early Spanish writers. Re- cent metallurgical studies throw much light on the details of the various operations of metalworking such as casting, gilding, and soldering. The problem of forgeries of pre-Columbian gold objects is discussed briefly. Finally the author speculates about the origins of the art of metalworking in ancient America. An appendix consists of translated excerpts and the corresponding figures from the Florentine Codex con- taining the work of Fray Bernardino de Sahaguin. This is followed by notes to the chapters and by a comprehensive bibliography of pertinent publications. This beautiful and informative book should be in every library of American archaeology. It will also be of considerable interest to the general reader. EARLE R. CALEY OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS</page></plain_text>
