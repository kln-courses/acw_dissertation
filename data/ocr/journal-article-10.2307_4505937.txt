ASHWORTH * "Acts proceeding from anger are rightly judged not to be done of malice aforethought; for it is not the man who acts in anger but he who enraged him that starts the mischief. Again, the matter in dispute is not whether the thing happened or not, but its justice; for it is apparent injustice that occasions rage." ARISTOTLE, Nicomachean Ethics, Bk. V, 8 IN English law the defence of provocation operates to reduce to man- slaughter a killing which would otherwise be murder. The defence is not available on any charge other than murder: provocation is generally regarded as a matter which goes in mitigation of sentence, being insufficiently fundamental to qualify as a complete defence. Even in murder cases the defence ought only to succeed where the jury is left in reasonable doubt that the accused killed during a sud- den loss of self-control caused by provocation which was enough to make a reasonable man do as he did, a test which has been criticised as unduly restrictive. The objective standard, embodied in the require- ment " enough to make a reasonable man do as he did," has attracted almost unremitting criticism from the writers. What function is the objective standard intended to perform? Does it perform this function successfully? In searching for the answers to these questions, the two factors isolated by Aristotle-the role of the provoker in causing the incident and the role of perceived injustice in weakening self-restraint -foreshadow the lines of inquiry. I. THE EMERGENCE OF THE DEFENCE When in the seventeenth century the defence of provocation began to assume a recognisable form and function, it took its place within a rigidly structured law of homicide. Killings were presumed to proceed from malice aforethought: if there was no evidence of express malice, then the law would imply malice. Evidence of provocation came to be accepted in rebuttal of this implication of malice,' the theory being that such evidence showed that the cause of the killing lay not in some secret hatred or design in the breast of the slayer but rather in provocation given by the deceased which inflamed the slayer's * Ph.D., Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Manchester. 1Cf. 3 Co.Inst. 47, although Coke failed clearly to connect provocation with the offence of manslaughter.

Hale thus "inquired, what is such a provocation, as will take off the presumption of malice in him that kills another," and he discussed the various forms of provocation which the judges had ruled sufficient or insufficient for this purpose. These decisions were conveniently summarised by Lord Holt C.J. in his judgment in Mawgridge,3 where the categories of provocation are set forth. It was generally agreed that any striking of the accused would be sufficient provocation, and Lord Holt discussed four further types of provoca- tion which had been held legally sufficient to rebut the implication of malice: (i) angry words followed by an assault, (ii) the sight of a friend or relative being beaten, (iii) the sight of a citizen being unlaw- fully deprived of his liberty, and (iv) the sight of a man in adultery with the accused's wife. The categories of provocation insufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter were (a) words alone, (b) affronting gestures, (c) trespass to property, (d) misconduct by a child or servant, and (e) breach of contract.4 Is it possible to infer from these categories the general criteria of " sufficiency" adopted by the judges at this time? One element was the significance attributed to an actual assault or physical threat: it is plain from Lord Holt's judgment that if an act falling within one of his five categories of " insufficient" provocation had been accom- panied by an assault-even a trivial assault such as nose-pulling or "filliping upon the forehead" 5-it would then be regarded as suffi- cient. This was consistent with the law's indulgence towards persons who fought on equal terms following a quarrel,6 and the essential distinction between words alone and an assault was probably that the latter showed the provoker's willingness and preparedness to fight.7 A second element, influential especially in Lord Holt's third and fourth categories of "sufficient" provocation, was the unlawfulness of the provoker's actions. The third category, the sight of someone being unlawfully restrained, can only be described as anomalous: the judges rationalised it on the ground that "if a man be unduly arrested or restrained of his liberty.. .this is a provocation to all other men of England," 8 but it came to be applied in cases where the 2 Hale, 1 P.C. 455. 3 (1707) Kel. 119. 4 Lord Holt lists the categories, and discusses the authorities for them, at Kel. 130-137. For present purposes it is unnecessary to analyse the previous decisions. s Per Lord Holt, at Kel. 135. 6 Death caused as a result of a sudden quarrel, " no undue advantage being sought or taken on either side" (Foster, C.L. 295), was at this time an inde- pendent ground for reducing murder to manslaughter: cf. Hawkins, P.C., ch. 31, s. 28; East, 1 P.C. 241. 7 Cf. the Statute of Stabbing 1604 (1 Jac. 1, c. 8), the history of which reflects this distinction: Radzinowicz, History of English Criminal Law, Vol. I, pp. 695- 698. s Hopkin Huggett (1666) Kel. 59, followed in Tooley (1709) 2 Ld.Raym. 1296. C.L.J. 293</page><page sequence="3">The Cambridge Law Journal illegality of the arrest could not have been known to the accused at the time he intervened.9 Thus Foster observed that this category was " utterly inconsistent" with the concept of provocation, which implies "something which the man is conscious of, which he feeleth and resenteth at the instant." 10 But, anomalous as it undoubtedly was, it suggested a connection in the judges' minds between wrongful con- duct by the deceased and the defence of provocation. This connection may be seen at its strongest in the adultery category. In the seven- teenth century adultery was one of the crimes of immorality punished by the ecclesiastical courts, and records show that it was a serious offence.1 It is therefore understandable that Lord Holt should lament that, although it was justifiable homicide to kill a robber, the killing of an adulterer was manslaughter. "So is the law, though it may seem hard that the killing in the one case should not be as justifiable as the other." 12 This, and other decisions not cited by Lord Holt,l3 show that the unlawfulness of the deceased's conduct was of itself important in determining the sufficiency of the provocation, and accord with the theory of partial justification developed below.'4 It was accepted in the early cases and writings that provocation might rebut the implication of malice even in cases of intentional killing. Where on the other hand there was a finding of " precedent malice," the provocation was deprived of all legal effect. In the leading case of Maddy,5 where a husband returned home to find his wife in the act of adultery and struck the man on the head with a joint-stool, the jury were asked to find whether Maddy had precedent malice, in the form of a prior determination to take revenge. So even where the provocation was of the highest degree, the element of sud- den passion had to be established. If he had known of the association and had declared his intention to take revenge, not even discovery in flagrante delicto would have reduced his offence from murder to man- slaughter. The beginnings of a causal approach to provocation cases 9 Tooley (above, n. 8), where Lord Holt replied: "surely ignorantia facto [sic] will excuse, but never condemn a man. Indeed he acts at his peril in such a case, but he must not lose his life for his ignorance, when he happens to be right." Cf. also Ferrers (1634) Cro.Car. 371. I0 Foster, C.L. 315; cf. Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), pp. 450-452. 1 Stephen, 2 H.C.L. 422-423. 12 Kel. 137. This " hardness " would be irrelevant to most cases, since killings in adultery cases are usually for revenge rather than for prevention. Lord Holt's point was probably that it is justifiable for a citizen to kill to prevent a robbery whereas it is not justifiable for one spouse to kill to prevent adultery by the other spouse. 13 GoIje's Case (1672) 1 Vent. 216; Clement v.

[1964] A.C. 1369. 294 [1976]</page><page sequence="4">The Doctrine of Provocation can be discerned in these early developments. The cause of a killing was presumed, by the doctrine of implied malice, to lie in the accused's wickedness of mind. Evidence of serious provocation would rebut this presumption by introducing a more probable cause: the incident originated in the provocative conduct of the deceased, which in turn aroused violent passions in the accused. The accused's con- duct could therefore be attributed to weakness of control or human frailty rather than to true wickedness. But this attribution could not be made if the accused's intention to attack the other was formed before the occurrence of the event alleged to constitute provocation. Within this context the categories of provocation were seen as indicating the relative gravity of the provocation and the consequent probability that it was an understandable weakness of self-control rather than wickedness of mind which caused the offence. As such, the categories were sometimes criticised, especially the rule that words alone could never be sufficient. But the categories of provocation were never limited to the function of indicating the probable cause for killings. There was more than a hint that people ought not to yield to certain types of provocation, and that if they did the law should offer no concession to them. This normative function may explain the resilience of the rule that words alone could not be sufficient provoca- tion.'6 It also explains the rule that lawful conduct by the deceased could not amount to provocation,17 and the rule that where the chain of causation led back to acts of the accused which had either sought, invited or incited the deceased's actions, the latter could not be relied upon as provocation.18 It was implicit in the categories and in these rules that proof of sudden loss of self-control alone was insufficient to establish the defence of provocation. The significance of Welsh '1 is that this normative element in the doctrine of provocation was made explicit. Judgments of proportionality form an essential part of the causal reasoning in provocation cases. However, "proportionality" has always had a rather loose meaning in the law of provocation. It would be difficult to claim an intrinsic proportion between A's kicking B 16 Cf. the observations of the Criminal Law Commissioners (Fourth Report, 1839 Parl.Pap. [1681 xix-235), who in their notes to Article 43 of their Digest argued that "words or gestures may often be infinitely more irritating and provoking that a personal injury of a trivial nature," but who also stated that if trivial provocations were allowed as sufficient, this would "weaken a salutary check, and withhold a signal mark of disapprobation stamped by the authority of the law." 17 Mawgridge (1707) Kel. 119, where the lawfulness arose from self-defence, and the authorities cited above, n. 13. 18 Hale, I P.C. 457; East, 1 P.C. 239; cf. further Ashworth, "Self-Induced Pro- vocation and the Homicide Act " [1973] Crim.L.R. 483. 19 (1869) 11 Cox C.C. 336, where Keating J. clearly articulated the objective standard of the sufficiency of provocation.

It was in this light that Lord Holt presented the categories of sufficient and insufficient provocations in Mawgridge,20 and his earlier decision in Stedman (1704) 2 carries the same point. When Stedman was about to enter an affray, a woman called out "You will not murder the man, will you? " to which he replied, " What is that to you, you bitch? " The evidence conflicted as to whether she there- upon struck his face with an iron patten or boxed his ears, but Sted- man certainly stabbed her fatally in return. Lord Holt directed the jury that if the woman merely boxed him on the ear, his offence was murder; but that if she had struck his face with a patten, it was only manslaughter. Some authorities, however, support a further require- ment of proportion-looking not only to the proportion between killing and the gravity of the provocation, but also to the proportion between the actual manner of killing and the provocation received. This was understandable in the context of a law of murder for which any intent to injure (in earlier days, an intent to do any unlawful act) provided sufficient mens rea. Thus on several occasions the courts held that where the accused did not intend to kill a smaller provoca- tion would suffice to reduce the crime to manslaughter.22 But it was also held in some cases that a particularly brutal mode of killing might restore the presumption of malice which had once been dis- placed by the provocation received. As East put it, where the retalia- tion "is outrageous in its nature, either in the manner or the con- tinuance of it, and beyond all proportion to the offence, it is rather to be considered as the effect of a brutal and diabolical malignity than of human frailty." 23 The requirement was invariably phrased in causal terms, presumably on the view that a particularly horrid show of violence could not be attributed to the provocation given and should therefore be ascribed to the accused's innate wickedness. The require- ment was slow to crystallise,24 but during the nineteenth century it came to be supported by a firm line of authority. It was applied in Thonas,25 where Parke B. asked the jury to determine whether the 20 Cf. especially Kel. 132. 21 Unreported, but discussed by Foster (C.L. 292) and by East (1 P.C. 234). 22 E.g., Wiggs (1784) 168 E.R. 291n.; Hazel (1785) 1 Leach 368; Fray (1785) discussed by East, 1 P.C. 236. 2. East, 1 P.C. 234. 21 In his article on " Provocation and the Reasonable Man" [1954] Crim.L.R. 740, Professor Glanville Williams argues that there was formerly a rejection of the proportion rule. He cites Ayes (1810) R. &amp; R. 166, a decision which certainly ignores any requirement of proportionality, although the reasons why the assembled judges altered the verdict from murder to manslaughter were not published. In favour of proportionality is Keite (1697) 1 Ld.Raym. 139, and the nineteenth-century authorities discussed in the text. 25 (1837) 7 C.-&amp; P. 817. 296 [1976]</page><page sequence="6">The Doctrine of Provocation blows could be attributed to the " passion of anger" aroused by the provocation or rather to "wicked and cruel disposition," and in Kirkham,^6 where Coleridge J. asked whether the blows received by the accused were truly "the cause of the crime." The Criminal Law Commissioners of 1839 stated that at common law an offence was murder if the retaliation was "so excessive and disproportionate to the cause of provocation that the killing cannot be attributed to mere heat of blood arising from the provocation given." 27 It will be noticed that the tendency was to state the requirement in terms of excluding extremes of ferocity (e.g., "excess," "beyond all proportion "), and not to foster the notion that for every type of provocation there is a " reasonable" or acceptable mode of killing. Courts and writers seem to have appreciated the looseness of this concept of proportion, and they used it only to exclude from the defence bad cases of dispropor- tionate violence. There was at this time no concept so exacting as "reasonable relationship." 28 II. IHE MODERN LAW OF PROVOCATION 28a The common and most simple way of explaining the present English law of provocation is to state that the defence rests on a subjective condition and an objective condition. The subjective condition is sometimes said to be "loss of self-control," 29 but close attention to the wording of section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 shows that a judge is not obliged to leave the defence of provocation to the jury in every case of a killing committed during loss of self-control. The Act requires " evidence on which the jury can find that the person charged was provoked... to lose his self control," the italicised words show- ing that the loss of temper must have been caused (in some sense) by provocation. A loss of self-control caused by fear, panic or mental instability cannot be brought within the defence of provocation. The objective condition has received far more attention from judges and writers. Its precise formulation in the modem law is open to some doubt, since section 3 of the Homicide Act was not intended as a complete statement of the law of provocation. Some of the common law rules undoubtedly survive, but it seems that the words of section 26 (1837) 8 C. &amp; P. 115. 27 Criminal Law Commissioners, op. cit., p. xxv: cf. below, p. 302. 28 Discussed below, p. 302. 28a Cf. now the Criminal Law Revision Committee's "Working Paper on Offences against the Person" (dated August 1976), which states the existing law and proposes certam changes. It will be referred to below simply as the Working Paper. 29 Smith &amp; Hogan, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (1973), p. 236: "Under the Act, the first hurdle for D is to satisfy the judge that there is evidence. .. that he lost his self-control." C.L.J. 297</page><page sequence="7">The Cambridge Law Journal 3 should be used by judges when directing juries as to the objective condition.30 The test, whether the provocation was " enough to make a reasonable man do as [the accused] did," telescopes two require- ments which have generally been regarded as separate. The first is the standard of the reasonable man, which functions as a means of assessing the gravity of the provocation, and the second is the proportionality requirement. Each of these will now be examined. (a) The Reasonable Man The standard of the reasonable man came into use in the nine- teenth century. The categories of provocation had never been regarded as fixed for all time, and gradually the judges abandoned the view that any physical assault was in law sufficient provocation.3' The question then became one of the relative severity of an assault. Judges began to leave this question of degree to the jury, and it was natural that the judges should call upon that jack-of-all-trades, the concept of the reasonable man, to express the required degree of seriousness. Thus in Welsh, Keating J. explained the law in these words: What I am bound to tell you is, that in law it is necessary that there should have been a serious provocation in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter, as, for instance, a blow, and a severe blow-something which might naturally cause an ordinary and reasonable-minded person to lose his self-control and commit such an act.32 When, early in the twentieth century, the courts were for the first time presented with the argument that for a mentally disturbed per- son a less serious provocation should be sufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter, the standard of the reasonable man was invoked to exclude any such concession. In Alexander,33 Darling J. dismissed the argument by ridiculing its consequences. In Lesbini,34 Lord Reading C.J. followed Alexander in refusing to lower the standard for those with "different degrees of mental ability," and laid down that in all cases the provocation must be such as would "affect the mind of a reasonable man." From this position it was a logical step to hold that intoxicated individuals should be subjected to the same standard.35 But, as we shall argue below, it was not necessary to hold that all the 30 Per Talbot J. in Brown [1972] 2 Q.B. 229, 234; cf. also English, "What did Section Three do to the Law of Provocation?

"3 [1914] 3 K.B. 1116. McCarthy [1954] 2 Q.B. 105; cf. also Thomas (above, n. 25). [1976] 298</page><page sequence="8">The Doctrine of Provocation accused's personal characteristics should be left out of account when applying the objective test. It is generally assumed that when section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 uses the term "a reasonable man" it refers to the concept developed at common law by the judges,36 and no judicial decision casts doubt upon this. This concept, however, has been the butt of considerable criticism. It is said to rest on the self-contradictory pro- position that a reasonable man could intentionally and unjustifiably kill someone,37 and to suggest that there is a hypothetical figure, "normal" in every respect, whose reactions are taken to determine the sufficiency of provocation.38 Now the argument that "no reason- able man would commit murder anyway " does not impugn the objec- tive test. Provocation has never been, nor ought it to be, a concession to all human weakness. The categories of provocation formerly set the standard of self-control which was thought appropriate for dis- tinguishing murder from manslaughter, and the "reasonable man" test is merely their generalised successor. This is not to argue that the term " reasonable man " was a felicitous choice. For, especially when it appears as " the reasonable man," it encourages the single meaning fallacy-the belief that there is one hypothetical figure serving as a paragon. The law's paramount concern is to ascertain whether the accused showed a reasonable amount of self-restraint,39 and the words "reasonable" and "man" have unfortunately diverted attention from this fundamental requirement. The word "reasonable" indi- cates quantity in the phrase "reasonable self-control," whereas in combination with the word "man" it begs questions about the age, sex, marital status, race, colour, religion and other personal character- istics of a hypothetical individual. If it is accepted that a primary purpose of the " reasonable man" test is to ascertain whether the accused showed reasonable self-control in the face of the provocation given, then it follows that individual deficiencies of temperament and mentality must be left out of account. On the other hand, a proper application of the standard does involve the jury in assessing the degree and gravity of the provo- cation. How can the gravity of provocation be measured? The first point, which could almost be described as a matter of definition if it ?6 This was certainly the intention of the Royal Commission on Capital Punish- ment, whose recommendations formed the basis of section 3: see Cmd. 8932 especially paras. 126-137 and para. 151. Cf. further English [1970] Crim.L.R. 250-255. 37 Smith &amp; Hogan, op. cit., 244. 3R Edwards, "Provocation and the Reasonable Man: Another View" [19541 Crim.L.R. 898, 900. Cf Cf. Coleridge J. in Kirkham (1837) 8 C. &amp; P. 115, 119: "the law...con- siders man to be a rational being, and requires that he should exercise a reason- able control over his passions." Cf. Gordon, Criminal Law (1967), who would ask whether " the accused made reasonable efforts to control himself" (p. 729). C.L.J. 299</page><page sequence="9">300 The Cambridge Law Journal [1976] had not been judicially challenged,40 is that it rarely makes sense to describe a provocation as simply "grave." Perhaps it makes sense with serious assaults, which may be universally perceived as gravely provoking; but in general a provocation can only be described as "grave" in relation to persons of a particular class. Thus the sight of two persons indulging in sexual intercourse cannot properly be described as a grave provocation-for it would hardly provoke the unrelated intruder to anything more than embarrassment-without adding that it would be grave for someone who is married, engaged or related to one of the participants. Similarly, to say that throwing a pigskin shoe is a grave provocation would be incorrect as a general proposition: but it would be grave to a Moslem.4' And to describe knocking a person's crutch away as a grave provocation only makes sense in relation to a person who relies on a crutch.42 To be meaning- ful, the "gravity" of provocation must be expressed in relation to persons in a particular situation or group.43 For this reason it is essential and inevitable that the accused's personal characteristics should be considered by the court.44 The proper distinction, it is submitted, is that individual peculiarities which bear on the gravity of the provocation should be taken into account, whereas individual peculiarities bearing on the accused's level of self-control should not.448 This very distinction was rejected by Lord Simonds, speaking for the House of Lords in Bedder v. D.P.P.4, Here the appellant had been taunted with his sexual impotence. His counsel argued that this 40 In Bedder (below, n. 45). 41 Cf. Uddin, The Times, 14 September 1929, a trial before Hawke J. involving a Moslem who killed another Moslem after the latter had thrown a pigskin shoe at him. Evidence of the religious significance of the shoe throwing was given. 42 Cf. Raney (1942) 29 Cr.App.R. 14. 43 There is an alternative, expressed in the phrase "the provocation he was sub- jected to." On this view, it would be a question of how much the accused was provoked by the particular events. This comes close to an abandonment of the objective standard, since it would extend the defence to a person who took an unreasonably serious view of trifling insults. 44 Cf. the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, recognising and not dis- approving of the practice whereby "juries not infrequently give weight to fac- tors personal to the accused in considering a plea of provocation" (Cmd. 8932, para. 145). It would be preferable if juries were expressly and sensibly directed as to what they should and should not consider, rather than leaving the matter to their intuition and sympathies. 44a The Criminal Law Revision Committee propose to replace the reasonable man test with a requirement that provocation is sufficient if "it constitutes a reason- able excuse for the loss of self-control." In the Working Paper, para. 54, they state that this would enable " any physical characteristics of the accused to be taken into account "; but they also say that the accused should be "judged with due regard to any disability, physical or mental, from which he suffered," which ignores the distinction advocated in this article. 45 (1954) 38 Cr.App.R. 133; this was the first appellate case in which the point had been squarely raised for decision, although Uddin (n. 41) and Raney (n. 42) had confronted the practical problem.</page><page sequence="10">The Doctrine of Provocation characteristic should be taken into account when considering the gravity of the provocation, but Lord Simonds L.C. replied in this well-known passage: It would be plainly illogical not to recognise an unusually ex- citable or pugnacious temperament in the accused as a matter to be taken into account but yet to recognise for that purpose some unusual physical characteristic, be it impotence or another... It is too subtle a refinement for my mind or, I think, for that of a jury to grasp that the temper may be ignored but the physical defect taken into account.46 The answer to the "illogicality" argument was adumbrated above: since the true function of the objective test is to apply a standard of reasonable self-control, it is vital to distinguish the element of self- control from other aspects of the personality. To lay down a test of "a man with reasonable self-control and with an unusually excitable temperament" would indeed be illogical; but a test of" an impotent men with reasonable self-control" contains no logical contradiction, for the two characteristics can co-exist and the reference to impotence assists in interpreting the gravity of the provocation.47 However, the distinction between factors explaining the gravity of the provocation and factors affecting the accused's level of self-control was perhaps difficult to make in Bedder, since there was evidence of emotional immaturity and instability related to the impotence. Bedder was, then, a hard case. It is submitted that it made bad law, for it is surely impossible to assess the gravity of provocation without reference to the characteristic of the accused at which the taunts were directed. Indeed, this point is so self-evident that it must have entered Lord Simonds' mind.48 The tone of his speech suggests a fear that, if per- sonal characteristics were considered even for this limited purpose, the objective standard would evaporate. But to hold that personal characteristics must be excluded entirely is to throw out the baby with the bath water-and to risk (and even connive at) disregard of the law by juries.49 On the other hand, a rejection of Lord Simonds' view need not deliver the law inexorably to the opposite solution of leaving the jury to apply the test "without any attempt [by the judge] to describe the reasonable man." 50 In that situation, the prosecution 46 38 Cr.App.R. at p. 141. 47 The distinction contended for in the text is accepted in New Zealand: cf. Crimes Act 1961, s. 169, as interpreted in Macgregor [1962] N.Z.L.R. 1069. See also note 44a, above. 48 Lord Simonds seemed to accept that the jury should place the reasonable man " in the circumstances in which the accused was placed," whatever that might mean: 38 Cr.App.R. at p. 139. 49 Cf. the Royal Commission's remarks, above, n. 44. 50 Smith &amp; Hogan, op. cit., p. 241; similarly Samuels, "Excusable Loss of Self- Control in Homicide" (1971) 34 M.L.R. 163, arguing that "the inscrutability of the jury verdict would remove the matter from the ambit of the law." C.L.J. 301</page><page sequence="11">The Cambridge Law Journal would no doubt contend for one interpretation and the defence for another. The choice is surely one of principle, and the law should take the decision. The rule in Bedder is visibly unjust; the alternative of complete jury discretion might only appear less unjust because the principles on which that discretion is exercised would be less visible. (b) Proportionality To what extent proportionality remains a requirement of the defence is open to doubt. At common law, excessive or disproportion- ate retaliation might bar the defence: retaliation going far beyond the seriousness of the provocation could hardly be said to be caused by the provocation, and it was attributed rather to the accused's wickedness or self-indulgence.5' Such reasoning is found in a number of modern judgments,62 although it had been questioned by the Criminal Law Commissioners in 1839: Where the provocation is apparently slight, and death be im- mediately inflicted in return with a deadly weapon, it may be said that antecedent malice may be inferred, or that the dispro- portion between the alleged insult and the return made is too great to allow such an effect to be attributed to so slight a cause. The question, however, cannot be one of inference independently of inquiry, and, therefore, cannot be a question of law, if it be possible that, in point of fact, the insult offered excited such a state of passion and want of self-control as occasioned the act.53 The concepts of excess and disproportionality were replaced in 1942 by the more positive requirement that " the mode of resentment must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation received." 5' This formula became known as the reasonable relationship rule: before 1957 judges used it as a ground for withdrawing the defence from the jury, and after 1957 it was commonly used in directing juries as to the rules they should apply.55 In 1969, however, the Privy Council disapproved the use of Viscount Simon's formula,56 and this dis- approval was repeated by the Court of Appeal in Brown.67 Despite these recent pronouncements, however, the concept of proportionality plainly remains an important element in the doctrine of provocation. Section 3 of the Homicide Act provides that the jury must determine whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do 51 Cf. the analysis above, pp. 296-297. 52 e.g. in McCarthy [1954] 2 Q.B. 105; McPherson (1957) 41 Cr.App.R. 213; Walker [1969] 1 All E.R. 767; Edwards v.

Thus "a jury might find that the accused's act was so disproportionate to the provocation alleged that no reasonable man would have so acted." 59 This may indicate a reversion to the less exacting concepts of excess and disproportionality which were in use before Mancini. The butt of many criticisms of the proportionality requirement is the law's apparent assumption that the reasonable man, even after he has lost his self-control, will continue to behave reasonably.60 Thus, adopting causal terminology, it might be argued that loss of self- control severs the chain of causation, so that any comparison between the provocation which caused loss of self-control and the frenzied actions which followed loss of self-control is misconceived. Now the essence of this critical challenge is that the law of provocation is founded on unsupported assumptions about human behaviour, and the challenge can only be discussed on a scientific and philosophical level. The scientific issue concerns the relation between behaviour during rage and the mechanisms for controlling behaviour. The philo- sophical issue becomes important to the extent that science is as yet unequal to the task of explanation. The law assumes that even in behaviour after loss of self-control there is a rational element, whereas the critics appear to adopt Hume's aphorism that "reason is... the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them." 61 What, then, can be learnt about the respective influences of reason and emotion upon behaviour which falls within the legal notion of loss of self-control? The working assumption of the law was explained by Lord Dip- lock in Phillips v. R. He stated that as a matter of common sense there are degrees of loss of self-control, and he rejected the proposition that "there is no intermediate stage between icy detachment and going berserk." 62 His Lordship went on to say that "The average man reacts to provocation according to its degree with angry words, with a blow of the hand, possibly if the provocation is gross and there is a dangerous weapon to hand, with that weapon." Prevailing scientific opinion treats violent rage as one form of emotional be- haviour. Emotional behaviour may have various causes, of which 58 Cf. White, "A Note on Provocation" [1970] Crim.L.R. 446, for a discussion of the meaning of the italicised words. 59 [1972] 2 Q.B. at p. 234; Talbot J. went on to quote Lord Devlin's words in Lee Chun-Chuen v. R. [1963] A.C. 220, 231: "Provocation in law consists mainly of three elements-the act of provocation, the loss of self-control, both actual and reasonable, and the retaliation proportionate to the provocation." 60 Smith &amp; Hogan, op. cit., pp. 242-244; Brett, loc. cit., below, n. 72. 61 David Hume, A Treatise on Human Nature, ed.

On the other hand, aggressive emotional behaviour is merely one of a range of possible reactions to provocation.63 Lord Diplock's reference to the average man is therefore questionable, except in so far as it really indicates that uncontrolled aggression is one of several "normal" responses to provocation. Lord Diplock's statement is also open to another criticism. The effect of provocation upon individuals is explained by psychologists in terms of a challenge to the self-concept, which evokes ego-defensive behaviour. Thus, as one leading psychologist writes, the provoker." is perceived as initia- ting a psychological threat to the self of the aggressor and to his feel- ings of pride and self-esteem. Interference by another is felt as humiliating, and there is resort to aggressive action to remove inferiority and restore self-esteem." 64 This analysis strikes a familiar chord: the oral insult, the threatening gesture, the angry blow and the discovery of adultery can all be translated into the common ter- minology of a challenge to the individual's self-respect and self-image, which evokes ego-defensive actions. The difficulty with Lord Dip- lock's statement lies in its implication that people are provoked by similar kinds of event and that their reactions follow a similar pattern. Now the type of affront to which an individual is vulnerable will naturally differ according to his set of values and his concept of himself, a phenomenon which may be termed "differential suscepti- bility." 65 Also, "the way in which human beings adapt to and con- trol their feelings of rage differs widely according to training," 66 so that each individual's behaviour after provocation may be strongly influenced by his upbringing.07 But these individual differences do not rule out all attempts at generalisation. For it may be possible to assess the gravity of provocation if one understands the characteristics and values of the individual accused, and there is evidence that differences in susceptibility tend to decrease as the magnitude of the threat or stress increases.68 There is also evidence that rational factors do affect the arousal of emotional behaviour, in the sense that the likelihood 63 C. N. Cofer &amp; M. H. Appley, Motivation: Theory and Research (New York 1964), pp. 417-423, discussing aggression, repression, regression and fixation as forms of response to frustration. Much psychological theory seeks to explain aggressive behaviour by reference to frustration, but the particular point in the text is not dependent upon the frustration-aggression hypothesis. 64 M. D.

References to the reasonable or average man must be expunged; the distinction between individual character- istics which tend to explain the gravity of the provocation and factors which bear on the individual's level of self-control must be inserted. Once it is accepted that individual characteristics are relevant to an estimation of the gravity of the provocation, it is surely possible to reinstate the principle that people react to provocation according to its degree. But the term " react" is ambiguous: does it mean that the amount of violence is roughly proportioned to the degree of provoca- tion, or that the degree of loss of self-control bears some relationship to the degree of provocation? Although present English law seems to rest on the former view, it is submitted that the intervention of loss of self-control is fatal to any direct comparison between provocation and retaliation. The second view, that the degree of loss of self- control should be related to the gravity of the provocation, is surely the true basis of the proportionality requirement.69" Thus the style of the retaliatory acts provides valuable evidence of the degree of loss of self-control.T7 The proportionality requirement would therefore rest explicitly on the proposition that there are degrees of loss of self- control." This proposition has been criticised by Brett,72 who argues that it cannot stand with the Cannon-Bard theory of emotional be- haviour. But the Cannon-Bard theory has been widely criticised, and it is merely one of a number of alternative theories.73 Moreover, the theory merely sets out to explain the physiology of emotional be- haviour. Cannon did not assert that behaviour can always be classi- fied either as wholly emotional or as wholly mind-directed, and others 69 Pastore, "The Role of Arbitrariness in the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis" (1952) 47 Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology 728-731, reporting an experi- ment the results of which suggest that any theory of human aggression must refer to the important difference between arbitrary and non-arbitrary stimuli. 69a A majority of the Criminal Law Revision Committee tentatively propose that the new test of "reasonable excuse" (cf. note 44a) should apply only to loss of self-control, and not to the actual form of retaliation: Working Paper, para. 56. On this view, the retaliation would merely be evidence of loss of self-control. 70 The proper inference from multiple wounding is however unclear. In some cases courts have adopted the view that the repeated infliction of wounds shows a degree of deliberation, in others courts have accepted that multiple wounding is consistent with " going berserk " or a total loss of control. The latter inference may well be more frequently correct. "7 Cross &amp; Jones, Introduction to Criminal Law, 7th ed. (1972), p. 151. 72 Brett, "The Physiology of Provocation " 11970] Crim.L.R. 634. 73 Whereas Storr (op. cit., p. 29) states that "subsequent research has done nothing to invalidate his [Cannon's] original thesis," other writers discuss "serious ob- jections which have been raised against some of its basic assumptions": Gross- man, op. cit., pp. 515-526, and Vernon, op. cit., pp. 78-79. 305 C.L.J.</page><page sequence="15">The Camnbridge Law Journal have argued persuasively that there are intermediate conditions in which the emotional drives and the rational controls may be in conflict 7a: At what point does anger change to rage, fear to terror or panic, and choice behaviour to compulsion? Frustration theory would demand some kind of sharp transition, whether in the form of a dropping out of voluntary control mechanisms or a sheer domi- nance of autonomic processes as provocation exceeded a certain point. The possibility of an intermediate condition, such as con- flict between the motivation and frustration processes, needs exploration... There is nothing in psychological theory which compels the view that either the emotions or the normal controls must be completely domi- nant. Research into emotional behaviour is still in its early stages, and none of the various theories commands general support. A further point, often overlooked by writers, is that the law of provocation has never required evidence of a total loss of self- control. The phrases used-" loss of self-control," " loss of temper," "gust of passion "-indicate an absence of the normal restraints, but not necessarily a transition to exclusively emotional behaviour. Provo- cation may succeed where there is some loss of self-control: there is no need for the accused to have gone berserk, and it may well be that sudden and impulsive conduct is often taken to fulfil the sub- jective condition, without detailed inquiry into whether " self-control" was " lost." 75 It is therefore submitted that conduct which fulfils the subjective condition is rational or mind-directed to the extent that (i) the impulse to react aggressively to provocation arises not arbitrarily but by reason of some perceived affront or challenge,7 (ii) where the loss of control is not total, the form of the behaviour may represent certain choices,77 and (iii) where the accused armed himself in antici- pation of trouble, this suggests an element of deliberation which is inconsistent with the doctrine of provocation.78 The submission is that any direct comparison between the retaliation and the provocation is indefensible, but that the form and style of the retaliation may pro- vide evidence as to whether there was a sudden loss of self-control and, if so, its degree. 74 N.

Maier, "Frustration Theory: Restatement and Extension" (1956) 63 Psychological Review, 370, 382. 75 Cf. the discussion of loss of self-control below, pp. 314-317. 76 Cf. above, n. 69. 77 For example, someone who reacts suddenly to provocation may retain sufficient control to pass over a glinting knife and vent his or her anger with a wooden spoon or with pottery: cf. White [1970] Crim.L.R. at p. 447. 78 Cf. above, p. 294, and the case of Gauthier (1943) 29 Cr.App.R. 113, where the accused went to meet his wife's paramour, taking a gun and leaving it near the meeting place. Even if he did lose his self-control and even if the provocation was grave, should not his forearming operate to exclude the defence? [1976] 306</page><page sequence="16">The Doctrine of Provocation III. THE OBJECTIVE CONDITION It is now proposed to examine separately the objective condition and the subjective condition in the doctrine of provocation. The objective condition in the existing law embodies the test of the reasonable man and the requirement of proportionality, each of which has been critically examined above. But the objective condition itself stands apart from these academic controversies. Probably neither cases in which the provocation was directed at some peculiar characteristic of the accused nor cases where the defence fails on account of the requirement of proportionality alone are frequent.79 The great majority of provocation cases seem to leave the court to determine whether the provocation was sufficiently grave to warrant a reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter.80 What are the theoretical foundations of this objective standard of sufficiency? It is contended here that the doctrine of provocation as a qualified defence rests just as much on notions of justification as upon the excusing element of loss of self-control. The term "partial justifica- tion" will be used for this, but the term does not necessarily imply a connection with the legal concept of justifiable force (i.e., in self- defence): its closest relationship is with the moral notion that the punishment of wrongdoers is justifiable. This is not to argue that it is ever morally right to kill a person who does wrong. Rather, the claim implicit in partial justification is that an individual is to some extent morally justified in making a punitive return against someone who intentionally causes him serious offence, and that this serves to differ- entiate someone who is provoked to lose his self-control and kill from the unprovoked killer. Whereas the paradigmatic case of murder might be an attack on an innocent victim, the paradigm of provoca- tion generally involves moral wrongs by both parties. The victim plays an important role in provocation cases, either as instigator of the conflict or by doing something which the accused regards as a wrong against him. Ordinary language reflects this approach, with characteristic phrases such as "he brought it on himself," "she asked for it" and "it served him right." Now the court which tries the accused's case is not standing in judgment upon the victim. But, pace Lord Devlin, it does not follow that the court " is not concerned with blame here-the blame attaching to the dead man." 81 The com- plicity of the victim cannot and should not be ignored, for the blame- 79 This is a strong impression, derived from reading many reported and unre- ported cases but unsubstantiated by systematic research. Cf. n. 80 below. 8O See further Ashworth, "Sentencing in Provocation Cases" [1975] Crim.L.R. 553, and sources cited thereat. 81 Cf. generally, for this view, the summing-up of Devlin J. in Dufly [1949] 1 All E.R. 932, described by Lord Goddard C.J. as a "classic direction" on provocation. 307 C.L.J.</page><page sequence="17">The Cambridge Law Journal worthiness of his conduct has a strong bearing on the court's judg- ment of the seriousness of the provocation and the reasonableness of the accused's failure to control himself.82 Aristotle clearly recognised this point, acknowledging the element of partial justification in his statement that "it is apparent injustice that occasions rage." 83 The objective standard may also be supported by causal reasoning. The offender's responsibility for a provoked killing may be said to be reduced by the fact that the victim's wrongful action was the original cause of the offender's loss of self-control. Aristotle seemed to accept this reasoning when he wrote that " it is... he who enraged him that starts the mischief," and Bentham took the same view."' Thus the objective standard might be defended on the basis that it distinguishes those cases in which the provocation was the substantial cause of the loss of self-control from those in which the provocation was so trivial that the loss of control is attributable rather to an abnormal weakness in the accused's temperament.85 The defence of provocation implies that the loss of self-control was caused by the provocation: if the provocation was objectively slight, this suggests that the substantial cause of the loss of control was not the provocation but rather some weakness (or wickedness) in the accused's character, and the case then becomes one of murder or mental abnormality-not provocation. " When we plead, say, provocation, there is genuine uncertainty or ambiguity as to what we mean-is he partly responsible, because he roused a violent impulse or passion in me, so that it wasn't truly or merely me acting 'of my own accord' (excuse)? Or is it rather that, he having done me such injury, I was entitled to retaliate (justifica- tion)? "86 The context in which J. L. Austin posed these questions betrays his view that elements of both justification and excuse are present, and we have attempted here to defend the law's objective standard on the ground that it respects these elements in the concept of provocation. But, although legal commentators have tended to 82 Cf. the developments in criminology which have led investigators to pay greater attention to the role of the victim in violent crimes. Hans von Hentig, The Criminal and his Victim (New Haven 1948), concluded that " the victim is one of the causative elements, and we would do well to pay more attention to him in judging the criminal and his action" (p. 436). M. E. Wolfgang, Patterns in Criminal Homicide (New York 1958), included in his study a category of " victim-precipitated homicides," although his definition was confined to cases in which the victim was the first to use force against his subsequent slayer.

Standing alone, it would lead the courts to in- dulge those who take the law into their own hands and deliberately wreak vengeance upon those who insult or wrong them. Without the subjective condition of sudden loss of self-control, as judges have frequently observed,87 every divorce petitioner who killed the co- respondent might be entitled to have his crime reduced from murder to manslaughter. But, e converso, without the objective standard and its flavour of partial justification, everyone who killed another in a fit of temper or rage would be entitled to have his crime reduced to manslaughter upon provocation, irrespective of the seriousness of the provocation and irrespective of whether the substantial cause of his loss of self-control lay in the provocation received or in his own fault or mental abnormality. The objective condition in the law of provocation has attracted a great deal of academic criticism. Two main lines of attack can be found in the literature: the criticisms of the "bad-tempered man" argument will be taken first, and an examination of Turner's argument on concessions to human weakness will follow. The Bad-Tempered Man Argument: Probably the best-known ex- position of this argument was that of Lord Cooper, the distinguished Scots judge. In his evidence to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, his Lordship reasoned that if the standard of the reason- able man were abrogated, " there might be circumstances in which a bad-tempered man would be acquitted and a good-tempered man would be hanged, which, of course, is neither law nor sense." 88 Criticisms of this argument generally run as follows.89 If the same provocation were given to both men and it was such as would pro- voke a reasonable man, both the good-tempered man90 and the bad-tempered man might be provoked to lose their self-control and 87 E.g., in Birchall (1913) 9 Cr.App.R. 91, Nuttall [1956] Crim.L.R. 125, and Fantle [19591 Crim.L.R. 585. Cf. the argument of T. H. Green, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation (1885), that failure to mitigate punishment in cases of strong provocation might tend to diminish respect for the right whose violation provoked the slaying. Thus, if the punishment of a man who was pro- voked to kill an adulterer in a quarrel was not reduced, this might tend "to weaken the general sense of the wrong-the breach of family right-involved in the act which, in the case supposed, provokes the homicide," (op. cit., p. 195). 88 R.C.C.P., Minutes of Evidence, Q. 5367; the argument was apparently accepted by the Commission: Cmd. 8932, para. 143. 89 Cf. Turner in Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), p. 546, and Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 19th ed. (1966), p. 178; Williams, "Provocation and the Reasonable Man" [1954] Crim.L.R. 740; Smith &amp; Hogan, op. cit., pp. 243- 244. 90 The "good-tempered man" surely means the same as "the reasonable man." If an anthropomorphic standard is to be used (cf. above p. 299), then the "nor- mally good-tempered man " would be more accurate. C.L.J. 309</page><page sequence="19">The Cambridge Law Journal kill; if they did so, each would be equally entitled to plead provoca- tion, whether the law laid down an objective or a purely subjective test. If the given provocation was not such as would provoke a reasonable man, then the good-tempered man would not lose his self-control whereas the bad-tempered man might lose control and kill; and if there were no objective test, the latter would have his offence reduced to manslaughter in this case. This is the result to which Lord Cooper and his supporters would object, and their critics reply thus: But whatever happens now to the " bad-tempered man "... will not make the slightest difference to the fate of the good-tempered man.9l If the good-tempered man does not kill, no question arises as to any equity between him and the bad-tempered man who does: the one commits no crime and can hardly feel unjustly treated if the other who kills is found guilty only of manslaughter."2 It is submitted that both Lord Cooper's argument and the academic criticisms are founded upon an error as to the relationship between the concept of justice and the criminal process. The error is encapsu- lated in the assertion that "no question arises as to any equity" between the man who kills and the one who does not. This form of reasoning is ill-founded, inasmuch as those who make an effort to control their tempers may well feel unjustly treated if others who fail to make that effort are nevertheless leniently treated. Moreover the reasoning is beside the point, for no system of criminal law either is or should be founded on the notion that what happens to an offender is no concern of anyone except others who commit the same offence. The crucial issue is whether the law ought to reduce from murder to manslaughter the crimes of those who kill out of bad temper-who kill, not after receiving the kind of grave provocation to which loss of self-control is an understandable reaction, but after receiving some trifling affront at which they fly into a violent rage. Comparisons between individuals and their feelings of justice afford little assistance in deciding this question of principle. Lord Cooper set off on the wrong foot, and his critics have been equally out of step. An assumption which underlies some statements of the "bad- tempered man " argument is that the objective standard exerts a deter- rent effect. Indeed, some arguments in support of the objective standard clearly imply that it encourages the development of reason- able self-restraint and deters people from readily giving way to their passions."3 It is wise to be sceptical when deterrent arguments are 91 Dr. Turner in Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), p. 546. 92 Smith &amp; Hogan, op. cit., p. 244. 93 In 1839 the Criminal Law Commission stated that abolition of the rule that words could not amount to provocation would "weaken a salutary check " (cf. above, n. 16); an American judge, Christiancy J., argued in Maher v. People 310 [1976]</page><page sequence="20">The Doctrine of Provocation applied to impulsive crimes, especially when the only direct deterrent effect would be limited to the difference between the penalty for murder and the probable sentence for manslaughter upon provocation. On the other hand, there might be an indirect effect stemming from the role of the law in supporting or reinforcing a code of social behaviour which deprecates loss of temper.94 But the primary rationale of the objective standard is that it declares the widely-felt distinction between someone who is truly provoked to kill (so that it may be said that the provocation caused the loss of self-control and partially justified it), and someone upon whose personality a relatively trivial provocation reacts in a disproportionate way. The Objective Test and the Congenitally incapable: Dr. Turner argued that the objective test in provocation deals unfairly with those who are congenitally incapable 95 of attaining a reasonable level of self-control: ... if the reason for excusing the "normal" man is that his innate control mechanism has been paralysed by events, how can it be ethically proper to refuse the like benignity to a " sub- normal" man when his innate control mechanism has been so paralysed; and thus to deal leniently with a man to whom nature has been moderately unkind, while treating with ruthless severity the man to whom nature has been immoderately unkind? 96 The doctrine of provocation is thus reproached with a cruel incon- sistency: it sets out to provide a concession to human weakness and yet it applies the same standard to persons of unequal capacities, with the result that what operates as a concession to " normal" individuals comes to others as the opposite of a concession. Turner based his attack on the theoretical argument that "it would be morally wrong and cruel to punish a man for what he could not prevent himself from doing," and on the practical argument that the application of the objective test sometimes produces "a result which offends the moral sense of many people, and therefore has an unfortunate tendency to bring the law and its administration into public odium and dis- repute." But what exactly is offensive to the popular moral sense- failure to provide such abnormal individuals with a defence to murder, or the failure to regard their offences as manslaughter upon provocation? Mitigation of the offences of these individuals may (1862) 10 Mich. 212 that "by habitual and long continued indulgence of evil passions, a bad man might acquire a claim to mitigation which would not be available to better men " (p. 220); and Fitzgerald, Criminal Law and Punishment (Oxford, 1962), argues that the abolition of the objective standard "would be to set a premium on hot temper " (p. 128). 94 Cf. Olivecrona, Law as Fact, 1st ed. (1939), pp. 150-168. 95 The term "congenitally incapable" is used to distinguish the more permanent incapacities from those which are temporary (e.g., induced by intoxication). 96 Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), p. 535. C.L.J. 311</page><page sequence="21">The Cambridge Law Journal indeed be desirable, as may their subjection to treatment rather than punishment, but the defence of provocation is hardly an appropriate vehicle. Where an individual who is congenitally incapable of exercising reasonable self-control is provoked by a petty affront, his loss of self-control must surely be ascribed to his own personality rather than to the provocation he received. Indeed, the objective test may be supported for drawing this very distinction: Other things being equal, the greater the provocation, measured in that way [i.e., objectively], the more ground there is for attri- buting the intensity of the actor's passions and his lack of self- control on the homicidal occasion to the extraordinary character of the situation in which he was placed rather than to any extraordinary deficiency in his own character.97 Conversely, therefore, where the provocation is objectively trivial, there are stronger grounds for attributing the loss of self-control to some character deficiency. The explanation might lie, for example, in a congenital incapacity, or in a temporary and voluntarily-induced incapacity, or in a simple failure to exercise control when this should have been possible. Whereas this last type of case provides a strong reason for retaining the objective standard, cases involving cogenitally incapable individuals surely have an independent claim to mitigation. As a matter of classification, the answer to Turner's argument is clear. The defence of provocation is for those who are in a broad sense mentally normal. Those suffering from some form of mental abnormality should be brought within the defence of diminished responsibility. But does the existing defence of diminished responsi- bility provide for this type of case? Could congenitally defective self- control amount to an abnormality of mind within section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957? 98 What variants of human nature enter the realms of abnormality? Is a persistent bad temper ... evidence of abnormality, or merely a lifelong lack of self-control? But may not chronic inability to establish self-control be an abnormality in itself? If so, is it an abnormality of mind? " Unfortunately, neither the eminent writer of these words nor sub- sequent events provide us with an answer.

As Lord Parker C.J. said in Byrne,3 the phrase "abnormality of mind" is "wide enough to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects," including " the ability to exercise will power to control physical acts in accordance with... rational judgment." Even a difficulty in controlling one's actions might fall within section 2, said Lord Parker, " provided that it is due to abnormality of mind." This suggests that if a psychiatrist were to classify a congenital incapacity to exercise reasonable self-control as an abnormality of mind arising from inherent causes, there is no legal bar to the court's accepting this. It is also possible, though rare, to have a combined verdict of manslaughter on grounds of provoca- tion and diminished responsibility: there is no contradiction as long as it is established that the events were grave enough to provoke even a mentally stable person to lose control.3a More frequent, however, are homicide cases involving elements of provocation where the defence do not even raise provocation and rely exclusively on diminished responsibility. This may be because the provocation was not enough to make a reasonable person lose control,4 or because lapse of time between provocation and retaliation would suggest deliberation,5 or because the true gravity of the provocation could only be gathered from a long course of conduct and not from the apparently trivial act immediately preceding the killing.6 On this last point, however, it seems that the courts may now be willing to accept "cumulative pro- vocation" as a basis for the defence of provocation.7 This is a welcome development which will reduce the temptation to stretch the law on diminished responsibility Logically, therefore, the objective test should operate to exclude from the defence of provocation those whose loss of self-control was 1 Per Lord Cooper in H.M.

The Committee fail to explore the relation of their proposed new test of provocation to defences based on mental disorder, yet the issue of classification is important.

The defence of diminished responsibility should be available to the mentally abnor- mal, leaving the others to be convicted of murder. Perhaps it is diffi- cult to shed all one's misgivings as to whether the law actually operates in this way. But it is equally difficult to accept the implica- tion of Turner's argument, which appears to require the abolition of the objective test in order to ensure that those who are congenitally incapable of exercising reasonable self-control have their offences reduced to manslaughter on grounds of provocation. IV. THE SUBJECTIVE CONDITION According to section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957, the subjective requirement in the defence of provocation is that the accused must have been "provoked ... to lose his self-control." 8 We have sought to explain, in Part III above, why grave provocation should be treated as a mitigating factor. Why should the law impose this additional requirement of loss of self-control? A conventional answer would be that after loss of self-control, a person's actions are not truly his own and he should not be fully blamed for them. Thus the subjective condition operates to distinguish between an uncontrolled reaction to provocation and deliberate revenge. To determinists, the question of whether the accused could have controlled or prevented his actions is incapable of answer, and the whole concept of loss of self-control is meaningless. But the law reflects prevailing usage by employing the concept to explain and to evaluate behaviour. If it is accepted that a person's actions after loss of self-control are not truly his own, one could go on to argue that liability and punish- ment are altogether inappropriate in such cases. Thus Howard writes: "once D has lost control of himself, his conduct becomes by defini- tion involuntary. This ought to mean that he should be acquitted, not merely convicted of a lesser offence."9 The definition to which Howard refers is that conduct is involuntary if it was uncontrollable at the time. Howard's strict temporal logic leads him to argue that "it is immaterial whether this condition [i.e., uncontrollability] results from provocation or any other cause," 10 but this form of argument has been roundly rejected by the English courts in analo- gous spheres of criminal liability, and it is surely unsupportable.1' Furthermore, Howard's point only holds good in cases of total loss 8 Cf. above, p. 297. 9 Howard, Australian Criminal Law, 2nd ed. (1970), p. 323. 1o Ibid. 1 Cf. Ashworth, "Reason, Logic and Criminal Liability" (1975) 91 L.Q.R. 102. 314 [19761</page><page sequence="24">The Doctrine of Provocation of self-control, and there is no evidence that either English or Australian courts require proof of complete absence of control before allowing the defence of provocation. On the other hand, the close relationship between loss of self-control and involuntary conduct should not be neglected, for one of the main reasons for mitigating punishment in provocation cases must be the abnormal difficulty of exercising self-control in such circumstances.12 There may be occasional cases in which the accused's blind rage was sufficient to amount to complete involuntariness, and others in which total loss of self-control negatives mens rea.'3 It is submitted that in these cases the law should eschew the logic which might lead to acquittals, and should revert to the basic principle that individuals ought to control themselves at all times, the defences of provocation and diminished responsibility representing the only concession to the difficulties which are sometimes felt. The subjective condition in provocation also reflects the separate and widely held view that sudden impulsive crimes should attract less punishment than premeditated offences. Proponents of this view relate impulsiveness to the actor's character. Thus Bentham main- tained that a sudden crime is a less conclusive indication of bad character than a premeditated crime.14 Retributivists should have little difficulty in agreeing that deliberate crimes suggest greater wickedness than sudden crimes and therefore deserve greater punish- ment. Yet it is surely undeniable, as Wechsler and Michael argue,15 that those who offend on impulse represent a constant source of danger to society, a danger which may be no less than that stemming from those who premeditate their crimes. If this is accepted, then it provides further justification for the objective test in provocation, for that test should distinguish those cases in which there was reasonable cause for the loss of temper from those in which there was not. Although it is therefore clear that both loss of self-control and the suddenness of a crime are grounds for mitigating punishment, the extent to which these elements are required in practice remains doubt- ful. The word "sudden" does not appear in section 3 of the Homi- cide Act 1957, but it is generally assumed to form an essential part 12 Cf. Sparks, "Diminished Responsibility in Theory and Practice" (1964) 27 M.L.R. 9, 18; Hart, Punishment and Responsibility (Oxford, 1968), at p. 153. 13 These types of case are discussed in greater detail by Gordon, op. cit., p. 719 (dealing with the Scots case of H.M. Advocate v. Gilmour, 1938 J.C. 1, where it was laid down that a provoked killing might be reduced to the crime of assault if the accused " acted in the first transport of his passion without appreciating to the full extent what he was doing "), and by Ashworth, 91 L.Q.R. at pp. 128-129. 14 Principles of Morals and Legislation, ch.

C.L.J. 315</page><page sequence="25">The Cambridge Law Journal of the doctrine of provocation.'6 The doubts flow from the fact that, in the great majority of provocation cases, the provocation which causes loss of self-control is merely the culmination of a protracted course of conduct by the deceased, and not an unexpected challenge or insult.'7 If the actual provocation need not be sudden, in the sense of being unexpected, must the retaliation be sudden and immediate? The authorities hold that the loss of self-control and retaliation must follow within a fairly short time of the last provocative event.18 As a matter of evidence, a court might be reluctant to infer loss of control at the time of the killing if time had elapsed between provocation and retaliation. Some authorities have gone further, suggesting that the law only allows a reasonable time for the passions to cool and that thereafter the defence of provocation is not available.'9 However, the preponderance of moder authority favours a purely subjective test of whether the accused did act during a loss of self-control caused by the provocation,20 and it is thought that this is correct. Evidence of cooling time might suggest that the accused was no longer out of control, but this must remain a question of fact.2' It appears that in most provocation cases the court does not inquire deeply into the question of loss of self-control. It seems to be assumed that a sudden killing, following quickly upon serious provocation, fulfils the sub- jective condition, and it is rare for a court to discuss whether an accused could be said to have lost control to a degree sufficient to support the defence. Only in cases where the prosecution leads evidence which suggests deliberation by the accused does the issue of sudden loss of self- control fall into sharp relief. Just as loss of self-control is usually in- ferred from a sudden killing, so courts have tended to infer from lapse of time a degree of deliberation inconsistent with loss of self- control. But this must always be a question of fact, for "it is im- possible to lay down any rules of law for determining whether the 16 In his "classic direction" in Duffy [1949] 1 All E.R. 932, Devlin J. referred to provocation which "actually causes in the accused a sudden and temporary loss of self-control." See also the Working Paper, quoted below, note 20. 17 Cf. above. n. 6. 8 Duffy [1949] 1 All E.R. 932; Brown [1972] 2 Q.B. 229, 234; but cf. now Davies, above n. 7. 19 Fisher (1837) 8 C. &amp; P. 182, where Park J. held that "whether the blood had time to cool or not, is rather a question of law "; Albis (1913) 9 Cr.App.R. 158. 20 Hall (1928) 21 Cr.App.R. 48; Lee Chun-Chuen [1963] A.C. 220; but cf. Mancini v. D.P.P. [1942] A.C. 1, 9. The recent Working Paper, however, appears to favour an objective test, stating in para. 57 that the defence "should apply only to loss of self-control arising suddenly upon the provoking event, and not to cases where the accused's reaction is greatly delayed." 21 The consequence of this would be that persons with unusually broody tempera- ments, like Albis (cf. above, n. 19), might be able to succeed on the defence of provocation even if they killed a day after receiving the provocation. Cf. Uddin (above, n. 41), where the defence did succeed in such circumstances. 316 [1976]</page><page sequence="26">The Doctrine of Provocation influence of passion has or has not ceased to operate." 22 Evidence suggesting premeditation will be relevant on the issue of sudden loss of self-control and also on the question whether the retaliation was caused by the provocation.23 As Lord Morris put it in Parker v. R. (1964), the defence cannot apply if the act was " done pursuant to an intent to take life which was either formed previously to or was formed independently of the provocation." 24 V. CONCLUSIONS It is one of the fundamental postulates of English criminal law that individuals ought at all times to control their actions and to conduct themselves in accordance with rational judgment. Loss of self-control is therefore never capable of amounting to a defence to criminal liability, although an inability to exercise normal control may be classified as a form of mental disorder and dealt with accordingly.25 The defence of provocation is the sole concession to loss of self- control by persons who are not classified as mentally disordered, and this defence can only operate to reduce murder to manslaughter.26 In modern English law the defence has two main elements, the sub- jective condition (that the accused was provoked into a sudden and temporary loss of self-control) and the objective condition (that the provocation was sufficiently grave to cause a reasonable man to react as the accused did). The union of subjective and objective conditions is no mere historical accident. It represents a fairly successful en- deavour to express the core features of provocation as a ground of extenuation for wrongdoing. Provocation mitigates moral culpability to the extent that a person acted in a less-than-fully-controlled manner in circumstances in which there was reasonable justification for him to feel aggrieved at the conduct of another. The law's subjective con- dition operates to ensure that it was not a revenge killing, but rather a sudden and uncontrolled reaction to perceived injustice. The objec- tive condition looks to the element of partial justification and, 22 Criminal Law Commissioners (op. cit.), n. to Article 44 of the Digest of Offences. 23 Cf. above, p. 302. 24 [1964] A.C. 1369, 1391; cf. the discussion of "precedent malice" above p. 294. The defence of provocation would still be available if the accused, having formed an intent to take revenge of another, then abandoned this intention, but was subsequently provoked to attack the other: such a narrative of events was accepted by the court in Fantle [19591 Crim.L.R. 585. 25 On a charge of murder, the defence of diminished responsibility might be open to such an individual: cf. above pp. 312-313. On charges other than murder, the accused might attempt to set up a defence of insanity under the M'Naghten Rules, but it is more common for mental disorder to be dealt with on conviction by an order under the Mental Health Act 1959. 26 With crimes other than murder, provocation can be taken into account at the sentencing stage. The arguments here apply equally to the issues of when, and to what extent, provocation should be allowed to mitigate punishment. C.L.J. 317</page><page sequence="27">The Cambridge Law Journal inevitably, to the conduct of the provoking party. It requires of the jury an assessment of the seriousness of the provocation, and a judgment as to whether the provocation was grave enough to warrant a reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter. This question of sufficiency is one of degree, and the legal rules, although they can take the court so far, cannot determine this ultimate question. Of course there will be clear cases-as, for example, where a teenage son loses control and attacks his bullying father-and there will be doubtful cases-as; for example, where a husband kills his wife during a quarrel over infidelity, which the parties had more or less accepted for a considerable time.27 Each case is for the decision of the jury, properly directed as to the law. In part II above, the present English law was criticised in two respects. First, the "reasonable man" test strictly precludes a court from taking account of the accused's personal characteristics when assessing the gravity of the provocation, and it was argued that in those cases where the provoca- tion was directed at some personal characteristic the seriousness of the provocation can only be estimated in that context. Secondly, the proportionality requirement suggests a direct comparison between provocation and retaliation, whereas the degree of loss of self-control should be approximately related to the gravity of the provocation, and the style and severity of the retaliation merely provide evidence of the degree of loss of control. However, it is thought that these points affect a minority of provocation cases, and that the objective seriousness of the provocation is usually the major issue. What would be lost if the objective test were abolished? The link with popular moral judgments about causation and blameworthiness would be severed: it would no longer be possible to say that the defence implies that the provocation was the substantial cause of the loss of self-control. The connection with the concept of partial justifi- cation would dwindle into insignificance in those cases where a trivial affront from one individual sparked off a cataclysm of violence in another. Phrases such as "he asked for it" or "it served her right" might have no application at all to cases in which the defence succeeded. Nor is this merely a matter of violating linguistic con- ventions. For it is surely intelligible in moral discourse to state that a person was provoked to lose his self-control in a situation in which he ought to have retained control. What, for example, is the proper attitude to cases involving policemen or children? It is arguable that citizens have a duty to retain their self-control when being detained 27 For further discussion of the problem of determining the gravity of provoca- tion, of. Ashworth, "Sentencing in Provocation Cases" [1975] Crim.L.R. 553. 318 [1976]</page><page sequence="28">The Doctrine of Provocation by a police officer acting within his lawful powers,28 and that there- fore someone who loses control and attacks a policeman in such circumstances should not be able to succeed on provocation. It is also arguable that no one should be provoked into a violent rage by a young child,29 and that the defence of provocation should not be available to a person who uses serious violence and kills in such circumstances. The objective test respects these moral distinctions: a purely subjective test could not. Similarly, where the accused created the situation in which someone else attacked him,30 the abolition of the objective condition would leave the court with no means of excluding the defence if it was satisfied that the accused ultimately lost his self-control. If one adds to this a probable diminution of the power to classify offenders and thus to ensure that those in need of treatment are sentenced accordingly,3' the abolition of the objective condition can be seen to have significant disadvantages in many respects. With what would the abolitionists replace the objective test? Smith and Hogan propose that " a purely subjective criterion " should be applied,32 but the consequences of this proposal are not discussed. Some of the difficulties which would flow from a subjective test were adumbrated in part IV above. How would the subjective condition be defined? If the phrase "sudden loss of self-control" were used, what degree of loss of self-control would be required? The concept would have to be sharpened considerably, for in the absence of the objective condition it would doubtless become a focal point for legal argument. Would the proposed test refer to provocation at all? If it provided that the accused must have been provoked to lose his self- control, would this import a substantial causal connection between the provocation and the loss of control? Do the abolitionists seriously maintain that every quarrel or petty affront which causes a loss of temper should become grounds for reducing murder to manslaughter? These doubts of substance and of definition must be removed before 2P Some might maintain that there should always be such a duty when dealing with a police officer, whether he is acting lawfully or not: cf. Fennell [1971] 1 Q.B. 428. 2P Cf. Lord Holt C.J. in Mawgridge (1707) Kel. 119, 134: "The like in obstinate and perverse children, they are a great grief to parents, and when found in ill actions, are a great provocation. But if upon such provocation the parent shall exceed the degree of moderation, thereby in chastising kill the child, it will be murder." In Smith (1914) 11 Cr.App.R. 36, Ridley J., arguendo, observed that " it is difficult to suggest how provocation could be given by a child of two and a half years." 30 Self-induced provocation cannot be dismissed as a remote possibility: cf. Toch, Violent Men (Harmondsworth 1972), on the role of some violent men as " exploiters " and as " self-image promoters." 31 Even if the prosecution were to be given the power to raise diminished respon- sibility in cases where the accused might be mentally abnormal, would that power be used sufficiently often? 32 Op. cit., p. 244. C.L.J. 319</page><page sequence="29">320 The Cambridge Law Journal [1976] any change is contemplated. The problem of explaining the objective condition33 to juries might be said to militate in favour of abolishing that test, or at least leaving a standard of reasonableness to the jury without further direction. But the expedient of consigning questions to jury discretion may too easily become a substitute for clear thinking. The question of how to convey legal distinctions to the jury is logically distinct from the problems of stating what exactly the law on a particular subject is. Only when, through thorough examination of the issues, we have a clear view of what the law should be, should we proceed to discuss the problems of conveying the law to juries. 33 A problem which, some would argue, might become more acute if the modifi- cations of the objective test suggested here were introduced.</page></plain_text>
