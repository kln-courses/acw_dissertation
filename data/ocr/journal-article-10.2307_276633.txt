<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS, GUATEMALA TATIANA PROSKOURIAKOFF ABSTRACT Inscriptions at Piedras Negras are shown to form a pat- tern of discrete sets of records, each inscribed on a group of consecutive monuments beginning with a stela depict. ing the "ascension motif." The earliest date in a series, identified by the upended frog glyph and called an "in- itial date" precedes the first dedicatory date by a number of years, falling within the span of an earlier series. A date in the first dedicatory hotun of each set is marked by a "toothache glyph" and is called the "inaugural date." The intervals between these dates are such that no single series exceeds the span of a reasonable lifetime, and it is suggested that the initial date represents something in the nature of a birth or name day of a ruler who accedes to power on the inaugural date, and that each set of monuments records the history of a reign. The represen- tations on monuments are interpreted as portraits of rul- ers and their families. Initial and inaugural dates at other sites are identified by their respective glyphs, but no artic- ulated series of reigns has been found outside of Piedras Negras. The variations of the upended frog and toothache glyphs suggest that they are essentially verbal action glyphs. Other action glyphs are correlated with motifs on Yaxchilan lintels, where they follow close upon date notations. Groups of glyphs following the action glyph are identified as appellatives, and are found to contain feminine head prefixes when they refer to robed or skirted figures of women. It is suggested that "ben-ich" katun notations occurring with appellatives of rulers are to be counted from their initial dates. Lunar and determinant meanings ascribed to dates are shown to have no relation to action glyphs accompanying them, and the historical approach is recommended as being more consistent with observed glyphic patterns. EVER SINCE TEEPLE (1931) first demon- strated the character of the lunar count in the supplementary series of Maya inscriptions, attempts have been made to find further as- tronomical significance in monumental texts. Perhaps the most amibitious was the work of H. Ludendorff (1930-43), who calculated as- tronomical configurations for a large series of Maya dates using the Spinden correlation. Both he and Spinden seemed convinced that the recorded dates were chosen specifically because of such configurations, but they failed to iden- tify any hieroglyphs that consistently accompa- nied events of a given sort, and by and large, their thesis was rejected by contemporary schol- ars. Two other propositions associating dates with calendrical significance have received wider acceptance. They too, however, fail to account adequately for the choice of the dates inscribed. Teeple's theory of determinants holds that some dates represent corrections of the solar year or are solar year anniversaries of the base of the long count, but in most cases the dates in question are not uniquely determined by the correction. For discussions of the problem, the reader is referred to Thompson (1950: 317-20), who has been the chief proponent of the theory, and to Satterthwaite (1947: 135-42), who has been its strongest critic. The second proposition concerns a period of 819 days, which appears as a common factor in five distances between dates identified by dis- tinctive glyphic passages (Thompson 1950: 212-7). No astronomical significance could be found for this number, and its function as a ritual cycle is not fully understood. In spite of the meagerness of these results and their failure to account for the pattern of date sequences, the hypothesis that Maya dates were chosen exclusively for their astronomical and calendrical significance still prevails, and the alternative, that they were essentially his- torical records, is expressly rejected by Thomp- son (1950: 64), and consistently ignored by others. To the argument that astronomical re- cords would inevitably result in frequent repe- titions of the same dates at various sites, Thompson replies in effect that the import of the dates was prophetic and that combinations of factors related to auguries were so numerous that the potential choice of dates was very large. Even if true, this argument is hardly sufficient reason to reject categorically the pos- sibility of historical content in Maya texts. It is hardly to be expected that the historical nature of dates can be demonstrated or dis- allowed until the hieroglyphic texts are at least in part deciphered, for history does not run in regular cycles. Its characteristic patterns are complex and variable, and the same event can be formulated in a variety of statements. Never- theless, there remains much that can and that needs to be said for the historical hypothesis, and in this paper I attempt to show that a cer- 454</page><page sequence="2">PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS tain pattern in the recorded events at Piedras Negras has the qualities one might expect of a historical narrative. Its general nature is that of overlapping but discrete series of dates, hav- ing a fixed order but variable intervals, and capable of being construed as expressing life histories of individuals (Fig. 1). This pattern is reflected in certain motifs depicted on the monuments, and in their physical grouping. Al- though in its entirety it seems to be peculiar to Piedras Negras, certain features of it can be detected also at Naranjo, though here the un- certainty of the deciphered dates and the poor photographic record of the inscriptions pre- clude an adequate reconstruction of the se- quences. PIEDRAS NEGRAS At this site (Maler 1901), the first monu- ment of a group dealing with a series of related dates is usually carved with a distinctive motif. In its characteristic form, this motif presents a person in ceremonial garb, seated on a cushion within an elevated niche or doorway reached by a ladder marked with footprints. I will call this the "ascension motif" (Fig. 3). The niche is framed by a "sky band" of astronomical signs, with a grotesque bird above, and a two-headed monster below, a combination of symbolic fig- ures that I will refer to as the "cosmic motif." In some cases where an ascension is depicted, there is a robed figure standing on the ground in front of the niche, and in at least one case, human sacrifice is symbolically indicated. The monuments dealing with a given series of dates are normally aligned in a group, their terminal dates recording an uninterrupted series of consecutive hotuns beginning with that of the ascension stela. Within the hotun recorded on this stela is given a date followed by a speci- fic hieroglyph identified by a vertical band or ribbon tied in a knot at the top as if binding the central element (Fig. 2, 1st column). The bound element varies in different inscriptions, and since it is sometimes the head of an ani- mate creature, J. E. S. Thompson, in informal discourse, has dubbed this form the "toothache glyph," a name which I will retain in order to avoid confusion of the glyph with other bundle forms. There is only one date in each series as- sociated with this glyph, and since this date stands near or at the beginning of the record of current events for the series, it will be called the "inaugural date." Such a date is often re- peated or celebrated by the record of its tun- count anniversaries. References to it cease when another ascension stela is erected and a new inaugural date takes its place. The only ex- ception is the record on Lintel 3, where a katun anniversary of an inaugural date is inscribed after at least one later series had run its course. Another class of dates is identified by as- sociation with the upended frog glyph heading the right column of phrases in Figure 2. Teeple (1931: 69) imputed to this glyph a lunar sig- nificance since a very similar glyph occurs in lunar series as Glyph D, but he was unable to determine its meaning precisely. Since dates associated with this glyph are normally the earliest of a series and precede the inaugural date by a number of years, they will be called "initial dates." When a series contains more than one initial date, the later initial dates apparently refer to subsidiary figures and, so far as we know, are the earliest references to them. The suggested terms are not intended to re- flect the supposed meaning of the dates re- corded or of the motifs, but are used to facili- tate reference and to make more immediately apparent the regularities in the grouping and in the records of the stelae. Some personal judg- ment has been unavoidable in presenting the monumental series, but as far as possible, specu- lations concerning the significance of the pattern are relegated to a separate section, in which a specific interpretation is suggested. A graphic summary of the pattern is given in Figure 1. Positions of hieroglyphs in texts are given by the system used by Morley (1937-38) and the following abbreviations are used to desig- nate monuments and dates: St., Stela; L., Lintel; Alt., Altar; Str., Structure; IS, Initial Series date; CR, Calendar-round date; PE, Pe- riod ending date (used also for expressed an- niversaries).

Stelae 25 and 26 constitute the earliest series that can be discerned. Unlike monuments of later groups, which were erected at hotun intervals, these are dated a katun apart. Morley places Stelae 28, 24, and 27 in the interval, but the dates on these monuments are illegible and there is no real evidence that these hotuns were ever re- corded. Stelae 41, 43, and 31, which Morley assigns to the hotuns following that of Stela 26, are also very dubious in date. They are associated with other South Group structures and there seems to be insufficient reason to include them with the Structure R-9 group. Nevertheless, the first series as described may be incomplete, or there may have been another series, not covered in this summary, intervening between Series 1 and 2. The toothache glyph appears on Stela 25 three times: first immediately following the supplementary series of the Initial Series date, then before a secondary series counted from it into the past (at 18), and finally after a series leading from it to the current hotun (at 112). In each case a reference to the same date is implied. There is an earlier date recorded, but judging by glyphs associated with it, it is not an initial date. Series 2 Monuments.

Thir- teenth tun anniversary - St. 34, PE at C9, connected by secondary series. Second katun anniversary - St. 38, CR at B9b (?). Although the initial motif of this group is not a niche composition, it appears to be only a variation of the ascension theme. The principal figure is seated on a cushion placed on a ped- estal with a plinth and an upper band or mold- ing which may be a "sky band." Obscuring the outlines of the pedestal is an intricate design in which one can distinguish the head of the so- called Celestial Dragon, a limb with its cloven hoof, and a serpent fret, of a kind that is used also in the design on Stela 11. The ladder and the footprints are not evident. Above the fig- ure there seems to be some sort of canopy. The figure is dressed in ceremonial garb and holds an object that most probably is a bag, so that its pose, with the exception of the head turned over the right shoulder, resembles closely the pose of figures in niches. The inscription on the sides of Stela 33 is eroded, and the inaugural date appears only on the front, where the toothache glyph does not seem to accompany it. The association of the date and the glyph on Stela 36, however, is per- fectly clear. The separation of the last two stelae from the group is irregular, but Stela 39, which re- cords a sequent hotun, is clearly not an ascen- sion stela, but one with a "warrior" figure. Moreover, Andrews (1942) has linked the in- scription on Stela 38 to that of the group by a katun anniversary, which shows the inscrip- tion to be part of this series. Series 3 Monuments.

The glyph at X8, however, has a coefficient of 10, and I suggest that this date reads 2 Ik 10 Pax and that it is the starting point of the secondary series at W6-W7. The revised inscription would read as follows: W8X8 (9.11.12.7.2) 2 (Ik) 10 (Pax) W6X6W7 1.2.5.19 W1OX10 (9.12.14.13.1) 7 (Imix) 19 (Pax) Wll 4.19(?) (9.12.15.0.0) (2 Ahau 13 Zip) There are three initial dates in this series. The second initial date occurs as a second Initial Series on two monuments, Stelae 1 and 3. In each case it is associated with a robed figure depicted on the back of the stela. It is about nine years later than the first initial date, which presumably is associated with the figure on the front. The third initial date is over 33 years later than the second and is inscribed on the back of Stela 3, where next to the robed figure is another very small one (Fig. 4). Series 4 Monuments.

Katun anniversary - L. 3, IS and PE at Fl. This series is regular except for the uncer- tainty as to what happens after 9.16.0.0.0. Stela 22 is described as showing a standing figure and is dated 9.16.5.0.0. The case here may be like that of Group 2, whose last two monuments are in a different location. If Thompson's (1943) reading for Stela 14 is accepted, the next series of dates begins and ends with the hotun 9.16.100.0.0. If this reading is in error, Stela 23 may record this hotun, and the next group would begin with Stela 16, erected in 9.16.15.0.0. In the following, it is assumed that Thompson's reading is correct. Series 5 Monument. St. 14- 9.16.10.0.0(?). Location. On terrace in front of Str. 0-13(?). Initial motif. Ascension, with cosmic motif and robed figure. Initial date. Unidentified. Inaugural date. 9.16.6.17.1 7 Imix 19 Uo (?) - St. 14, IS with toothache glyph at Bll. This monument stands alone unless at this time there were concurrent groups. The orig- inal placement of monuments in front of Struc- ture 0-13 is very uncertain, and the eroded in- scriptions provide little additional evidence. Series 6 Monuments. St. 16-9.16.15.0.0; St. 13(?) 9.17.0.0.0; St. 17(?); St. 18 or 19(?). Location. In front of Str. 0-13; exact location uncer- tain. St. 16 is probably the first monument of the group aligned in the plaza. Initial motif. Destroyed. Probably standing figure. Fig- ure of boy and two adults on sides, as on St. 11. Initial date. Unidentified. Inaugural date. 9.16.12.10.8 6 Lamat 1 Mac-St. 16, CR with toothache glyph at C5. A drawing made by Mary Butler of the front of Stela 16 seems to indicate that the figure is standing. If this is true, the association of the ascension motif with the inaugural date is broken at this time, but the traces of sculpture are so vague that a misinterpretation of the lines and their significance seems very possible. The entire pattern at this time becomes rather uncertain for there are more monuments in the plaza in front of Structure 0-13 than can be accounted for on the basis of a single monument for each hotun. The next group apparently be- gins with Stela 15 on the summit of the pyra- mid, and this again is a standing figure. Series 7 Monuments.

PROSKOURIAKOFF ] 459</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The series begins with a standing figure, but this figure is neither a warrior nor a grain- scatterer. It is carved in unusually high relief and is shown holding a bag, as do the seated niche figures. The ascension motif may have been expressed by its high position on the pyra- mid or on surrounding architectural features. After the assignment of stelae in front of Structure 0-13 to the hotuns intervening be- tween Stelae 16 and 15, there remain six unas- signed monuments: Stelae 18 or 19, 20, 21, and 23; Altars 3 and 5. If these monuments belong to Series 7 its record could be extended to 9.19.10.0.0 or 9.19.15.0.0. It is possible, how- ever, that Series 7 is not the last and that an- other series is represented. Odd Occurrences of Upended Frog and Toothache Glyphs Lintel 1. Upended frog glyph and three other glyphs in association with a female figure. No associated date. Lintel 2. Toothache glyph at K'1 without affixes and with animal head as main element; first in panel of five glyphs probably referring to minor figure behind the chief warrior. No associated date. Lintel 3. Toothache glyph at A'1 following secondary series counted from 2 Cauac 2 Muan, and possibly also immediately after this date. The long count position sug- gested by Morley is 9.16.6.10.19, 122 days before the in- augural date of St. 14 (Series 5). The IS on this lintel records the first katun anniversary of the inaugural date of Series 4, and as Thompson (1944a: 77-8) has shown, the record continues at least to 9.17.11.6.1, which is a tun anniversary of a date on Throne 1 (Series 7). Thus, the inscription on L. 3, unlike the stela inscriptions, is not limited to dates of a single series. Discussion and Speculations The data summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1 lead to the following observations: 1. That the ascension motif at Piedras Ne- gras marked the beginning of a series of monu- ments dealing with a sequence of related dates, and that the motif symbolized an event that recurred at irregular intervals and was of some civic and religious importance. 2. That the earliest date relevant to a series was marked by the upended frog glyph, and was some distance in the past when the ascen- sion motif stela was set up. Later dates marked by the upended frog glyph, and also called initial dates, begin records dealing with sub- sidiary figures. 3. That the ascension motif is associated with a date which falls in the hotun preceding its erection. This date, called the inaugural date, probably, though not necessarily, is the date of the event symbolized by the ascension. 4. That the initial and inaugural dates are normally repeated and celebrated by anniver- saries only within the series in which they occur, the inscription on Lintel 3 being unusual in this respect. 5. That the distance between the initial date of a series and the inaugural date of the next does not exceed the limits of a reasonable life- time. These observations indicate that at least some of the events dealt with in Piedras Negras in- scriptions are periodic, but not cyclical, and that each series can be construed as recording a sequence of events in the life of a single in- dividual. Inference carries us no further, but if we make some basic assumptions, we can explore a hypothesis without commitment, and it is in this spirit that the following interpreta- tions are offered, without claim that they are the only possible interpretations or even that they are the best that can be devised. The first assumption made is that the inau- gural date celebrates the accession of a new ruler. The ascension motif seems peculiarly appropriate to express such a theme, especially in view of certain passages in the Books of Chilam Balam that refer to the "seating" of rulers. From Roys' translation of the rise to power of Hunac Ceel (Roys 1933: 75), one might quote the following phrases (italics mine): "Then they began to declare him ruler. Then he was set in the seat of the rulers by them." And further: "Then they began to set aloft the house on high for the ruler. Then began the construction of the stairway. Then he was set in the house on high in 13 Ahau, the sixth reign." Elsewhere there is mention of the "Jaguar mat" in connection with office, and the markings of a jaguar pelt can be clearly seen on the cushion on which the ruler is seated on Stela 25. If the inaugural date celebrates the accession of a ruler, the initial date, which falls between 12 and 31 years earlier, must represent an event that happened early in the ruler's life, possibly even his birth, though more probably some ceremony corresponding to baptism or to his initiation into formal training. Years counted from initial dates will therefore be regarded as "ages" of the individuals concerned, with the understanding that they may fall somewhat short of ages counted from birth. 460 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="8">PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS On the basis of these assumptions, the fourth column of Table 1 shows that the lengths of successive reigns were about 35, 47, 42, 28, 5, and 17 years, averaging to a reign of 291/2 years. Where relevant figures are known, the ages of rulers at accession are shown in the first column of Table 1 to be roughly 12, 22, 28, and 31 years. Their lifetimes, measured from initial dates to inaugural dates of the next series, are 60, 64, and 56 years, and the distances between generations of rulers, 38 and 36 years. The last two figures, associated with long reigns, sug- gest that the succession was not always from father to eldest son, since the figures are too high to represent normal distances between generations. The lifetimes and the reigns in- dicated are also of greater length than one would expect, and it is possible that sometimes on the death of a ruler the reign was continued by a younger brother, as Landa describes hap- pening in Yucatan (Tozzer 1941: 100), with- out the event calling for a new accession monu- ment. Nevertheless, even if the figures refer to single individuals, they are well within the bounds of possibility for a limited period, and in default of evidence to the contrary it will be assumed that the principal figures of a group of monuments all portray the same person. Thus one can envisage Stela 25 with its as- cension motif as representing the accession of a ruler, whose portrait a katun later appears on the companion Stela 26 in the guise of a "war- rior" with two prisoners at his feet, apparently symbolizing an aggrandizement of his power or some exploit of valor. Fifteen tuns later, with Stela 33, begins the longest reign recorded. The incumbent ruler at the time of his accession was not yet 13 years old, and perhaps because of his youth, he is shown with a robed figure beside him. If we knew the initial date for Stela 14, which shows a similar robed figure, we could check this interpretation, but that date, unfortunately, is unknown. Robed and skirted figures on Maya stelae have always posed a problem, for some scholars have been reluctant to accept them as figures of women. This reluctance hardly seems justi- fied since the discovery of the Bonampak murals, in which a woman and a child play an important role in the ceremonies depicted (Ruppert, Thompson, and Proskouriakoff 1955). There is also confirmation of the female sex of robed figures in hieroglyphic passages associated with them, which almost always contain female head glyphs. The inscription on the front of Stela 33 contains one of these glyphs. Evidence on this will be presented later, and at this time it will be assumed that all the robed figures at Piedras Negras represent women. On Stela 32, the ruler is shown holding a shield. There is a robed figure on the right side of the monument, possibly the same as on Stela 33, but more probably a wife of the young man, who was then 21 years old. Five years later, he is shown on Stela 34 with a shield and hatchet. The next monument is glyphic and we have no portrait of the ruler in this hotun but when he had reached the age of 36, on Stela 35, he seems to have gained considerable TABLE 1.

The reign of this ruler adult figures may represent tutors or guardians lasted for 47 years, and he would have been of the boy. 60 if he were still living when the next ruler acceded. This ruler, shown on Stela 6 (Fig. 3), was 22 years old. On the side of the monument is .. depicted another figure, but it is not altogether ii,iii - '.:! clear whether it is that of a man or a woman. A lahuntun later, on Stela 2, on which the main figure is shown with a gesture of scatter- * ing grains, the figure on the left side clearly wears a robe, and on the top of the monu- ment there is a curious little figure that seems * to be sitting in a tub or basket. One is led ....*.. to wonder if this might represent the first born of the royal pair. If so, he never succeeded to the throne, for the initial date of the next ruler was still four and one-half years ahead. When Stela 4 was erected, the ruler was 37, ! ! and, as befits his age and rank, he is shown as a warrior with two prisoners. On the next two monuments, Stelae 1 and 3, his portrait is eroded, but two portraits of the woman who was probably his wife are excellently preserved- -?i on the back of the monuments. The initial i i ! date that goes with these portraits shows the woman to have been nine years younger than her husband, and 37 years old at the time of the erection of Stela 3. On this stela (iFig. 4), !* she is shown sitting on a throne with a small :: child beside her, a little girl, three years old, as indicated by a second initial date recorded on this monument. This unusual representation and the next, on -:?:' Stela 5, may indicate that at this time there was no natural successor to the throne. Stela _ .-- 5 shows a young man confronting the ruler, who is seated on a jaguar throne surrounded by cosmic or dynastic symbols. If this composition can be construed as expressing the appointment of a new successor, it can be shown by the initial date of the next series that he was at this time 15 years old. On the next two stelae in this group the ruler is shown in the guise of a warrior with prisoners (Fig. 5), and then on Stela 11, the successor assumes his rule at the age of 28. On the left side of the monument is shown a young man or boy, who presumably is his heir, and on the right are two adult figures. One of FIG. 3.

Stela 10, erected in 9.15.10.0.0, shows a young man seated on a cushion and a jaguar standing behind him and extending a foreleg over his head. This motif is analogous to motifs on two Tikal lintels (Maudslay 1889- 1902, Vol. 3, Pls. 71, 72), one of which is FIG. 4. Figure of woman and child on the back of Stela 3, Piedras Negras, with accompanying record. Photograph courtesy of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. associated with the same lahuntun date. What this arrangement may signify it is hard to say. Stela 40, which was erected next, shows a bust of one figure on a throne, and another figure on the canopy above, scattering grains. What seems to be suggested is some delegation of power, perhaps a temporary subservience to a foreign potentate, perhaps an acting head of government appointed to carry on the functions of an incapacitated ruler. The end of this reign and the beginning of the next is clouded partly with uncertainties of decipherment but also with apparent complications of succession. Lin- tel 3 (Fig. 6), though carved much later, prob- ably recounts what happened. Its inscription begins with the katun anniversary of the inau- gural date of Stela 11, falling soon after the erection of Stela 40. A gathering or council is shown, and in the background panel of glyphs we recognize the toothache element. The date associated with this element is not placed in the long count, but if Morley's sug- gested position is correct it falls only 122 days before the inaugural date on Stela 14, and per- haps is not itself an accession date but that of the council at which the decision of succession was made. If our interpretation of the robed figure on Stela 33 is correct, the chosen ruler on Stela 14 was very young at the time, and could have been one of the children shown on Lintel 3. He did not rule long, however, for on Stela 16, erected only a hotun later, there is another inaugural date. The face of this monument is badly eroded, but the arrangement of figures on the sides is almost identical to that on Stela 11, showing a boy and two adults. If we assume that the boy is the ruler whose initial date appears on Throne 1, we find him to be 16 years old at the time. The age of the ruler himself is not known, but judging by the grain scattering motif, on Stela 13, he probably was still a young man, for on Stela 2 this motif oc- curs near the beginning of a series and after a ruler passed the age of 30 he seems to have been shown more often as a warrior with prisoners. Stela 15 is probably the accession stela of the next ruler, whose dates appear on Throne 1. He was 31 years old at accession, and was 45 when, on Stela 12, he is shown arraigning pris- oners in charge of two assistants.

Behind him, on the border of the monument are two dates connected by a sec- ondary series of 4.8.2.14 (almost 87 years). This series is not connected to the main inscrip- tion, but apparently begins about 25 years be- fore the initial date of this inscription and ends within a year of its final hotun date. Morley (1937-38) does not make clear in his publica- tion if any identifying glyphs occur with the first date. His diagrams show four glyphs in the upper group, but only two are drawn. It is possible, therefore, that a glyph identifying this date was present, and that the age of the pris- oner was indicated. These interpretations show that the motifs of sculpture at Piedras Negras are entirely con- sistent with the theme of dynastic succession. None of the events, however, have been sub- stantiated and another set of assumptions may produce a totally different but equally success- ful hypothesis. I have seriously considered the possibility that an ascension stela may represent human sacrifice and the apotheosis of the vic- tim, but have found it difficult to account for the presence of figures of women and children in such a context. The stress on the familial theme, if it is accepted as historical, leads in- evitably to matters of genealogy and the attain- ment of pre-eminent status. Whether similar themes, less realistically expressed, are characteristic of other Maya cities, I have been unable to determine. The toothache glyph occurs sporadically at other sites but no articulated sequence of inaugural dates can be found. At Naranjo there is some evidence of discrete chronological series, but the grouping of the monuments and the pattern of the dates of their erection are different from those observed at Piedras Negras, and many inscriptions are inadequately recorded. NARANJO Naranjo stelae were often set up in pairs, one of each pair presenting a male figure, the other a figure wearing a skirt, and the inscriptions of both ending on the same date. Male figures sometimes occur singly or grouped together, but all skirted figures have potential mates; though the erosion of inscriptions sometimes makes it difficult to prove their affiliation. The stelae of a pair sometimes stand side by side, sometimes face to face across a small plaza, and some- 464 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="12">PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS FIG. 6.

The initial date is preceded by another on stelae with female figures, but, as at Piedras Negras, it is the earliest date accompanying a male figure, and was 14 years in the past when it was recorded on Stela 22. It is not mentioned again with male figures, and a date about 51/2 years later is celebrated by anniversaries in its stead. Another important difference with the pattern of Piedras Negras is the absence of an inaugural date on the first stela. If one is recorded at all, it is on the final stela of Group 1, Stela 23.

PROSKOURIAKOFF ] 465</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The date on Stela 6 is read by Morley as 9 Ahau 13 Muan, but, in my opinion, the month coefficient is better read as 11. If this is the inaugural date for the series, its most probable positions are: 9.18.4.2.13 9 Ben 11 Muan and 9.18.17.5.18 9 Eznab 11 Muan.

As I have pointed out elsewhere (Proskour- iakoff 1950: 126-7) the date proposed by Mor- ley for this stela does not accord well with its style, which is similar to that of Series 1. The best positions for the date on the front are: 9.13.17.11.16 7 Cib 19 Chen and 9.12.17.7.16 7 Cib 19 Yax. Series Undetermined Monument. Stela 32. Location. In East Plaza in front of Str. C-IX. The composition of this late monument sug- gests that it may correspond to the ascension motif of Piedras Negras and may begin another series. The stela dates from 9.19.10.0.0, but no relevant intermediate dates have been identified. Discussion and Speculation Until dates are better deciphered at Naranjo the pattern cannot be successfully compared with that of Piedras Negras. The inaugural dates at Naranjo do not appear to have been marked by a distinctive motif, nor is there any indication that they or initial dates were cele- brated by anniversaries. The initial date, how- ever, appears to retain an early position in the series, apparently the earliest that refers to a male figure. If we follow the interpretation suggested for Piedras Negras, the woman on Stelae 24, 29, and 3 is evidently of an older generation than the man on Stelae 22, 30, and 2. Terminal dates do not run in a sequence of consecutive hotuns as they do at Piedras Negras, and are sometimes odd dates or their anniver- saries. The assumption that every terminal date represents the date of the erection of the monument on which it is found does not seem justified here. In the case of Group 2, Series 1, the distribution of dates suggests that the whole group may have been set up as a unit on the lahuntun which ends the record as a whole. On the two monuments with male figures, Stelae 30 and 28, between 9.14.0.0.0, when the record begins, and 9.14.10.0.0, when it ends, 14 dates are inscribed in sequence. Of these dates, 13 fall in the first hotun, and only one after 9.14.5.0.0. Perhaps the date 9.14.- 3.0.0 was chosen for the end of the first in- scription merely to distribute these dates more evenly on the monuments. This would pre- suppose that the group had been planned after the recorded events had taken place. It seems quite likely that monuments at Naranjo were normally erected regularly at lahuntun inter- vals and that a number were set up simultane- ously to take a single record, their terminal dates being not "dedicatory dates" but merely intermediate stopping places in a single his- torical record. Thus, Group 1 of Series 1 may have covered the lahuntuns 9.13.10.0.0 and 9.14.0.0.0. Group 2 was probably set up in 9.14.10.0.0, and Group 3, where the date 9.14.1.3.19 seems to end at least one inscription, may have carried the count forward to 9.15.0.0.0. In Series 2, Stelae 13, 33, and 34 may have been erected at one time, with Stelae 14 and 12 added at lahuntun intervals. Groups 2 and 2a may have been set up in 9.19.0.0.0, though in this case the stylistic variation in the monuments makes me suspect that Stela 6 is earlier.

This is the only known case of two inaugural dates occurring in one inscription. Like that on Lintel 3 at Piedras Negras, this record may span the period of two "reigns." The variant forms of the toothache glyphs, however, give warning that one or both references may be not to an inaugural date but to one in some way related to it (Fig. 7). 466 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="14">PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS j5t. 26AlblJ' X . . :5 5 ::75 5t. 6 X1 :~4,:,8 0 ; L 0 S t / X 10 0 C4L I &lt;-22 5 e ___-. _, Wg:6 W C: &gt;Xjt 27T /7 ISk{ fEL CAY Oo si X'1 A2 B2~X~i~9~U ~Sf-A 17 (OPA LEN(RUE i~ ~~frog glph t various te.L) PAL~NQu x ~- 0 f ~ St~ ilI(f 24?ili IZ\ if~p/ Qoo? nt. _T~~~eIG 7.

Distance from initial date is 2.3.5.10 (42+ years). This very important inaugural date at Yax- chilan falls just at the time when at Piedras Negras there is some sort of irregularity in suc- cession. Comparing phrases on Yaxchilan Stelae 11 and 12 with those on Piedras Negras Altar 2, Throne 1, and Lintel 3, we find a number of similar glyphs, among them what I take to be the hieroglyph that Berlin (1958, Fig. 28) identifies as the "emblem glyph" for Piedras Negras, though he distinguishes the form used at Yaxchilan as a different symbol. I find it also very striking that the bat and the jaguar head at D4C5 on St. 12 (Fig. 7) recur at A'2Z3 on Lintel 3 at Piedras Negras. I ven- ture to suggest that these glyphs refer to one of the lords of Yaxchilan, who at Piedras Negras either headed the council represented on Lintel 3, or was the subject of its deliberations. The presence of two emblem glyphs in phrases re- ferring to this person and to some of the rulers of Yaxchilan, suggests to me a close union between the ruling families of the two cities at this time. The toothache element in an unusual com- pound occurs at Yaxchilan on Lintel 26 at K'1 (Fig. 7) and variants of the upended frog glyph on Lintel 35 at V6 and on Lintel 42 at E3. These are not directly associated with dates. Bonampak Inaugural date. 9.17.5.8.9 7 Muluc 17 Yaxkin -St. 2, CR with toothache glyph at El. Kuna Initial date. 13 Chicchan 13 Yaxkin-L.1, CR with upended frog glyph at Ml. Palenque There are a number of initial dates at Palen- que, but their long count positions are in many cases uncertain, and the upended frog often follows secondary series, where its association with a date is not always clear. The Temple of the Cross inscription seems to deal specifi- cally with initial dates, the earliest of which falls before 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. The record is discontinuous, and only a few of the initial dates seem to be connected to earlier dates by secondary series. An adequate discussion of the Palenque initial dates would be too lengthy to be included here. A distinctive compound containing the toothache element occurs in a number of records (Fig. 7, Cross, R15S15), usually in a context of other non-calendrical glyphs. I do not know of an inaugural date clearly recorded. Copdn The very important date, 9.16.12.5.17 6 Ca- ban 10 Mol, which occurs seven times at Copan and is celebrated by a katun anniversary on Altar T, is probably an inaugural date, though the inscription on Altar U seems to make it also an anniversary. On a step in Structure 11, it is followed by a glyph that includes the toothache element, and in Gordon's illustration of Altar V (Fig. 7; Gordon 1902, Fig. 20) the eroded glyph following it looks as if it may be the toothache form. Elsewhere, the date seems to appear without affiliation with a toothache element, but the typical affix cluster of inaugural dates is used on Altar U with a glyph that resembles Thompson's "seating of the haab" glyph, and again after a record of six tuns on a jamb of the north doorway of Temple 11. It seems likely, therefore, that 6 Caban 10 Mol was an inaugural date, though references to it do not always include the toothache element. Tooth- ache elements in various compounds unas- sociated with dates occur at Copan on Stela 9 at C9 and F3, and on Altar F' at C3 (Fig. 7; Gordon 1902, Fig. 26). Initial dates.

This list is incomplete. There are some toothache elements and many more upended frog glyphs for which date associations could not be found. J. E. S. Thompson, who very kindly supplied me with a list of the incidence of the two glyphs from his as yet unpublished dictionary of Maya hieroglyphs, and with sev- eral suggested readings of dates, cites in his list 31 examples of various toothache element com- pounds and 81 examples of the upended frog glyph, exclusive of its use in lunar series. In addition he calls attention to the toothache element in, Codex Madrid 90a-93a, and in Codex Dresden 23b and 67a. In the Dresden, the toothache elements are followed by designa- tions of gods, and on page 23b, various food offerings seem to be the subject of the text. GLYPHIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE DATING PATTERN The fact that the toothache glyph and the upended frog glyph are associated with certain dates in an ordered pattern indicates quite clearly that they signify events of a recurring nature. Thompson (1950: 264) notes that in divinatory almanacs in the codices, the first glyph of successive phrases is usually a glyph denoting some action or happening, and the toothache glyph holds precisely this position on Dresden 23b and 67a. Here the toothache element appears without affixes and is followed in each case by the designation of one of the gods. On the monuments, the expression is somewhat more complex, but the same order of the action glyph and the appellative holds, although the appellative is not one of the known god names and probably refers to the ruler of the city or district, since it changes with each set of records. The first column of Figure 2 shows phrases that follow inaugural dates at Piedras Negras. The toothache glyph stands immediately after the date and is recognized by the vertically tied main element. The normal form is best exemplified on Altar 2, where the glyph is seen to have a "ti" prefix, a "ben-ich" superfix and a suffix that is more clearly rendered on Stela 36. Here it is clear why Thompson called this the "toothache glyph," for the tied element is the head of a vulture, a bird that also appears as a separate form following the toothache element on Stela 11 at Yaxchilan. It is used also in a cartouche for the day Ahau (Piedras Negras L. 3, V4, and St. 15 on pouch) and in place of the tun element of the katun (St. 3, F3). On Lintel 2 it ends three passages designating warriors who kneel before their leader. The vulture, therefore, may be some- thing in the nature of a title or a clan symbol. There is also on Lintel 2 at K'l a toothache glyph in the form of an animal head, but in later inscriptions the bound element tends to resemble the abstract "lunar" form. In three cases, a so-called "lunar" postfix is added to the normal form of the glyph. I am not sure what circumstances determine its use or omission, but it occurs consistently with predicate glyphs, that is, with glyphs that im- mediately follow dates and that tend to be associated with certain motifs in sculpture. Various investigators recognize it as a verbal postfix, and Knorozov (1958a: 285) gives it the value h(a) or ah. On Lintel 2, Stela 15, Throne 1, and Lintel 3 at A'1, the toothache glyph is expanded into two characters. The first contains the toothache element with varying postfixes, and the second is made up of the affixes contained in the single form. When an anniversary of an inaugural date is recorded (L. 3, G1; St. 3, Fl; Cenote Jade), only the affix cluster is used to denote the event; the toothache element is dropped. From this as well as from the fact that it is used alone in the codices, one may infer that the toothache element stands for a ceremony celebrating the event indicated by the affixes. For example, if the full phrase reads "the seating (of the ruler) on accession," the affix form following a period could signify "the anniversary of the accession" without mention PROSKOURIAKOFF ] 469</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY of the ceremony. The actual meaning of the terms is unknown, but some such construction is implied in the expansion and contraction of the forms. In one instance at Yaxchilan (Fig. 7, St. 11, C4; St. 12, C2) and in another at Copan (Temple 11 step, Altar U), an inaugural date is followed in one record by the toothache glyph, and in another by a different character preceding the usual affix cluster. This charac- ter resembles one translated by Thompson (1950, Fig. 19, 37-51) as "the seating of the haab." Although it stands in the same relation to the date and to the affix cluster as the tooth- ache element, it is not a substitute for it since the following glyphs are not those that stand after the toothache expression. Apparently an- other observance taking place on the same date is indicated by the variant clause. The diversity of statements accompanying inaugural dates makes them sometimes hard to identify, but it offers an excellent test for phonetic decipher- ments, which, if they are valid, should result in readings making clear the relation of the differ- ent forms and linking them to a common event. The upended frog glyph, used with initial dates, varies less than the toothache glyph. When it stands immediately after a date, it always has the same suffix and the so-called "lunar" postfix. Sometimes, when it precedes the date or stands after a secondary series lead- ing from it, as on Piedras Negras Stela 11 at F5a (Fig. 2), the lunar postfix is dropped, but this does not seem to have been mandatory, since at Palenque there are several examples of the upended frog glyph retaining the postfix after secondary series. Additional glyphs referring to events or to ceremonies can be identified at Yaxchilan by their constant association with certain scenes portrayed on the lintels. Such glyphs always follow close upon the notation of a date. Among them is the "capture glyph" (Fig. 8 a) which frequently occurs with scenes showing the capture of prisoners or with figures holding a serrated spear. This glyph, like the upended frog glyph and the toothache glyph, takes a "lunar" postfix. A similar glyph in the codices has been read by Knorozov (1958a: 471, no. 15) as "chucah," past tense of "chuc," trans- lated in the Motul dictionary as "asir y prender, y echar mano, y tomar a uno en fragante delito, o hallarle en alguin maleficio," or "alcanzar a otro siguiendole," or "dar alguna enfermedad a alguno." The glyph in Figure 8 b goes with representations of a serpent from whose jaws issues the head and torso of a human or gro- tesque figure. I suspect that this motif represents a rite performed in memory of a dead hero, since its glyph is often associated with a date far in the past. The form in Figure 8 c accom- panies pictures of the blood-letting rite. Bar- thel (1955, note 95) notes a glyph of similar construction, but somewhat different form used with tongue sacrifices in the codices. It seems safe to say that glyphs which im- mediately follow dates and especially those that tend to combine with the "lunar" postfix make reference to actions, events or ceremonies, and are essentially predicate glyphs. Following them we can expect to find substantives referring to the protagonists of the events, and if the rep- resentations are historical, some of these should be appellatives identifying the persons involved. a r 2-24 1412-1 VV-~ Q~ I ~Zl b c FIG. 8.

On Stela 36 (C1-D5-) all three animal heads following the toothache element are identical to the heads after the upended frog glyph, and two of them appear also in the record on Lintel 2 at X5, which makes reference to the inau- gural date of the same series. In other cases, there is some degree of variation in the glyphs following the first, but it seems to me no more than one might expect in a group of appella- tives applied to a person in different stages of his life, a group including not only personal names, but also titles, kinship designations, and honorary or descriptive epithets. Many of the appellative glyphs are zoomorphic, consistent with Roys' (1940:35) comment that "many Maya patronymics are derived from well-known ani- mals and plants." There are also abstract forms such as that heading the phrase on Throne 1 (H'3-R1-). This phrase is repeated on Lintel 3 (U11-); Thompson (1944a: 77-8) has read the last date on this lintel as falling within the contemporary record of the Throne 1 series. The inscription on the lintel also records an anniversary of the inaugural date of an earlier series represented by the phrase on Altar 2 (D3-), and the appellatives in the two nota- tions are identical except for the omission of one glyph in the later inscription (L. 3, G2). The last glyph of these phrases is the "em- blem" glyph, identified by Berlin (1958) and associated by him with Piedras Negras. This glyph carries through several sets of records, but on Stela 36 it takes a different form, and I am inclined to think that it refers to lineage or dynasty rather than to place. Preceding the "emblem" in some instances is an anthro- pomorphic jaguar head, which varies in detail in different sets of records. It can appear alone, when it apparently makes brief reference to the person elsewhere designated by a group of appellatives. A corresponding glyph in a more natural form of a jaguar at Yaxchilan is of peculiar interest, and more will be said of it later. Here I merely want to point out that the study of the distribution of different forms con- tained in appellative phrases in respect to the different sets of records has at the very least the practical utility of aiding us in the reading of partially legible dates by limiting the span of time in which they can occur. Of even greater interest perhaps is the possibility of understanding the structure of nomenclature used by the ancient Maya and of tracing family relationships between the figures depicted in sculpture if our surmise concerning the appel- lative nature of these glyphic groups is correct. In this connection, we should note that robed figures, which some have interpreted as male priests or penitents, are almost invariably as- sociated with appellative glyphs prefixed by feminine heads, as on Stelae 1 and 3 (Fig. 2). These heads are identified as feminine by a hatched oval on the forehead, which corre- sponds to the black spot used in the codices to identify women, or by a more naturalistic de- piction of a lock of hair. On Stelae 1 and 3, the first appellative is a katun sign prefixed by a feminine head. This has been read as "1 katun," but such a record here has little mean- ing. The katun sign is worn on the headdress by the figure on Stela 1, and I believe must serve as a name or title. Although "Katun" is not one of the known Maya names, Roys (1940) gives "Ix Nacan Katun" as "the name or title of the head of a celibate religious order of women" in Yucatain. I doubt, however, that the lady in question was celibate, for on Stela 3, she is shown with a child, whose names also are prefixed by feminine head glyphs. In- scriptions dealing with robed figures at Yaxchi- lan and with skirted figures at Naranjo contain similar glyphs prefixed by feminine heads, while appellative glyphs referring to male fig- ures more often take zoomorphic or abstract forms. Heinrich Berlin, in a recent study of name glyphs at Palenque (MS) has reached the same conclusion on the function of some feminine head glyphs there. Turning now to inscriptions at Yaxchilan, I want to point out another implication of the arrangement of records in distinct sets that can be identified by appellative glyphs. Berlin (1958) has noted the frequent occurrence here of two distinct phrases, one containing a jaguar glyph combined with a bird, a Cauac glyph, and the record of three ben-ich katuns (Fig. 9 c), and the other, a jaguar with a shield, a glyph with an Ahau element, and the record of four or five ben-ich katuns (Fig. 9 a, b). As an added or alternative glyph with the bird-jaguar phrase, there is a moon-like glyph, and with the shield-jaguar phrase, a death-head glyph. Many of the records at Yaxchilan contain only Calen- dar Round notations of dates, and it is reason.

The question of how this is done has been a thorn in the flesh of epi- graphers for many years. I am not certain that even now we can reach a definite solution of the problem, but there is a cogent possibility that these katuns are to be counted from initial dates of records identified by the different jaguar phrases. In the inscription on the shells from Burial 5 at Piedras Negras (Fig. 10), are two notations of four ben-ich katuns, one following the date 9.12.14.10.11 9 Chuen 9 Kankin, the other after 9.14.17.14.17 1 Caban 0 Mol (end of Yaxkin). Obviously these ben-ich katuns can- not both be counted from the same date, nor even from the beginnings of contiguous inter- vals. We can observe, however, that preceding the first notation is an anthropomorphic jaguar head which occurs in appellative phrases for the second and fourth series at Piedras Negras. a b FIG. 10. Two notations of the fourth ben-ich katun from shells found in Burial 5, Piedras Negras. a, with date 9 Chuen 9 Kankin (9.12.14.10.11); b, with date 1 Caban 0 Mol (end of Yaxkin, 9.14.17.14.17). Although the distinction between the two gro- tesque heads is not entirely clear, here it must be the second series which is meant, and count- ing from its initial date, we find that the date referred to falls in the fourth katun of the series. The second date belongs to the third series, and falls in the fourth katun from its initial date. The difficulty lies mainly in iden- tifying the series or sets of records referred to, for neither here nor at Yaxchilan, is it always clear what particular glyphs identify the ruler or otherwise designate a reign. On Lintel 30 at Yaxchilan, following the initial date, are the bird-jaguar and a moon-like glyph at G2,H2. The same glyphs recur on Lintel 31 at I1,J1, immediately after the inau- gural notation of 11 Ahau 8 Tzec (9.16.1.0.0), and this time are followed by three ben-ich katuns (Figs. 7, 8). Since 9.16.1.0.0 does fall in the third katun after the initial date, this in- scription bears out our hypothesis. On Stela 11, which records the same inaugural date, 9.16.1.0.0, we run into some complications. Morley's reading of Q13 as 7 katuns I believe can be rejected, since the vertical element here is clearly not a bar. One would expect, as on Lintel 31, the record of three ben-ich katuns, but the ben-ich element is not evident, even if we can restore the eroded coefficient as three. The Cauac glyph is here added to the jaguar phrase together with its constant predecessor, and the moon-like glyph is somewhat changed from the form it has on Lintel 30. On the front of the stela, the notation of three ben-ich katuns and the bird-jaguar places the date 9.15.19.1.1 correctly in the third katun, though this date actually precedes the inaugural date and would normally be recorded in connection 472 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960 I ~ r</page><page sequence="20">PATTERN OF DATES AT PIEDRAS NEGRAS with an earlier reign. The moon-like glyph is dropped from this phrase. The relevance of the notation in the middle panel of the back of the stela is not clear. If it goes with the date 9.15.15.0.0 in the panel above, then our hypothesis is apparently contradicted, but there is already a record of five ben-ich katuns in the panel, preceding the bird-jaguar notation, so that the latter must refer to some other event. The shield-jaguar and five ben-ich katuns are connected with the date 9.15.9.17.16 in a lower panel, and a similar notation with an added pair of glyphs including an Ahau ele- ment ends the inscription on the base, which records the inaugural date 9.16.1.0.0. The shield-jaguar and the Ahau element occur again with the male figure in the upper panel on the front of the monument, the portrait, no doubt, of the retiring ruler (Fig. 11), whose initial date must fall somewhere between 9.11.- 1.0.0 and 9.11.9.17.15. On Lintel 56, the fifth katun of this jaguar is given with the date 9.15.6.13.1, thus lowering the upper limit of his initial date to 9.11.6.13.0. On the lintels of Structure 23, where an Initial Series 9.14.8.12.5 is recorded, the shield-jaguar phrase contains the record of four ben-ich katuns. This is entirely consistent with the hypothesis, but the dates 9.12.9.8.1 on Lintel 25, and 9.13.17.- 15.12 on Lintel 24 are outside of the range of the fourth katun, and the ben-ich katun nota- tions that follow them must refer to the dates on the front of these lintels, though it is not altogether clear to me how this reference is indicated in the text. The most serious contradiction of all occurs on Stela 6, where a date read by Morley as 9.11.3.10.13 5 Ben 1 Zotz is stated to be the second katun anniversary of the inaugural date of the bird-jaguar. This statement cannot be reconciled with the record on Lintels 30 and 31 unless we assume that there were at least two rulers at Yaxchilan with the same or with very similar names. I do not want to minimize these difficulties, but they do not seem to me to be insurmount- able, and they have no real bearing on the general conclusion that if the ben-ich katun notations do place dates in the long count, they must refer to some overlapping system of re- cords analogous to that described for Piedras Negras. That this hypothesis demands a re- reading of many of the dates proposed by Mor- ley for the Yaxchilan lintels is all to the good, for Morley's dates are spread over too long a period of time to be consistent with the styl- istic uniformity of the sculptures. I am con- fident that when we understand more about FIG. 11. The front or "deity" side of Stela 11, Yaxchi. lan. The figures in the upper panel may be ancestral por- traits.

PROSKOURIAKOFF ] 473</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the structure of the jaguar phrases at Yaxchi- lan, we can reach a satisfactory solution of the problem of the ben-ich katuns. The first important step is the recognition of the phrases as groups of appellatives referring to the current rulers or to their associates. This historical postulate can only be tested by use, but it seems to me it has already shown many advantages over the view that only religious and astronomical matters are dealt with in Maya texts. For example, neither lunar nor determinant meanings that have been advanced for dates show any correlation whatever with the hieroglyphs that follow date notations or with the sculptured representations on the monuments on which the dates occur. Teeple suggested (1930: 55-7) that the dates, 9.12.2.- 0.16 at Piedras Negras, 9.12.10.5.12 at Naranjo, and 9.16.1.0.0 at Yaxchilan, celebrate the change to a lunar calendar. The first is an initial date followed by the upended frog glyph and associated with a female figure. The second also goes with the figure of a woman, but is not an initial date. The third is an inaugural date, associated with the toothache glyph and with figures of men. The determinant theory also applies indis- criminately to various classes of dates and mon- uments. Two katun determinants listed by Teeple (1931, Table 7) are inaugural dates: 9.10.6.5.9 from Piedras Negras and 9.16.12.5.17 from Copan. A third date, 11 Lamat 6 Xul, from Palenque, is an initial date, and the class of others is unknown. Thompson (1950, Table 21) lists among determinants for 8 Cumku the inaugural date 9.17.5.8.9 from Bonampak, and this is the only date of its kind that the table contains, the date 9.14.2.11.9 from Piedras Ne- gras being of undetermined character. All this does not mean that we must aban- don the search for astronomical meaning in inscriptions, or that we need to make a cate- gorical choice between the two approaches to the problem of date interpretation. But the astronomical approach has had a long head- start on the historical, which has never been put to the test. Perhaps if we had expended as much time on seeking historical data as has been spent on lunar calculations, we might have collected by now a substantial body of facts on the dynastic structure of the Maya "Old Empire." To be sure, final solution of the import of the texts must probably await the decipherment of hieroglyphs, but we are not yet so close to this achievement that we can afford to neglect other ways of tackling the problem, and the historical approach deserves at least an earnest consideration on our part.
