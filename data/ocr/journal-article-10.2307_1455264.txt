The present work, dedicated to the memory of the great scholar Georges Vajda, is an annotated edition and French translation of Part I of Narboni's commentary on Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. The editor, who has been devoting himself to the works of Narboni, calls this commentary Narboni's crowning achievement. Introduced to the Guide by his father at the age of thirteen, Narboni was raised in an atmosphere of advanced philosophical and exegetical speculation. He showed some interest in mystical writings, but all of his works, even where he seeks to reconcile kabbalistic views with philosophy, as he does in his Pirqe Moshe,2 represent a stage of thinking which has left behind the popular appeal of kabbalah. Like Saadiah, whose early commentary on the Sefer Yesirah led him away from kabbalah by way of philosophical cosmology and rejection of the flat earth picture of the old tradition, Narboni seems to have gotten the central theses of the kabbalistic world view out of his system through the purgative effects of writing a philosophically based commentary, in his case, on the Shicur Qomah, that most flagrantly anthropomorphizing of Hebrew texts. The turning point of Narboni's life was his discovery of Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198), whom he came to regard as the premier exponent of Aristotle: the wise rightly called Aristotle divine, Narboni wrote, because the Divine gave him perfect knowledge of the first principles of things, in which there is no room for error.3 Narboni devoted his literary life to increasingly independent commentaries revolv- ing around the figures of al-Frabli, al-GhazalT, Ibn Tufayl, Maimonides, and of course Ibn Rushd. He absorbed Ibn Rushd's distaste for Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037), and when he found Maimonides disappointing, he blamed the perceived lapses on overdependence on Ibn Sina. Following a polemical suggestion of Aver- roes, Narboni ascribed al-Ghazall's spirited attack in The Incoherence of the Philosophers to the intolerant times in which the great Muslim theologian of the East (1058-1111) must have lived. Narboni went on to find al-Ghazali's true views in the Maqdsid al-Faldsifah, ("The Goals of the Philosophers"), on which Narboni * Maurice Hayoun. Moshe Narboni.

Al-Ghazali's masterful summary of Farabian-Avicennan thinking was in fact, as al-Ghazall claimed, the foundation for the carefully focused refutations of twenty philosophic theses in the Tahdfut. But this Narboni could not accept. How could anyone have understood the system of the philosophers so well without accepting it? In his personal favorite (131*11O) among his own works, a commentary on Ibn Tufayl's JHayy Ibn Yaqzdn,' Narboni conducts a running battle with Ibn Tufayl and through him with Ibn Bajjah, insisting that a good society does not require withdrawal into solitude as the price of communion ("conjunction," as our transla- tors like to render ittisdl) with the Active Intellect. At the same time he defends Ibn Tufayl against the charge of having actually held doctrines that Narboni finds unacceptable. He uses his commentary to espouse a vigorously intellectualist Averroistic monopsychism and neoplatonizing monism which reject temporal crea- tion, where Ibn Tufayl had treated it as a legitimate form of theism, and even rejects Ibn Tufayl's underlying thesis of the ultimate spirituality of matter (since the principle of its existence is form). As Narboni sees it, Maimonides had taken Ibn Tufayl's approach to these issues as his point of departure; and by insisting on a less conciliatory and more stridently Averroizing reading of the inner meanings and implications of Ibn Tufayl's arguments, Narboni hints that he is laying the founda- tion for a setting aside of Ibn Tufayl's style of accommodating tradition, not only in IHayy Ibn Yaqziin but also in the Guide as well.5 The outcome is what we would call deconstructive, discovering a theologically subversive if politically conservative inner meaning behind the allegedly unconvinced and unconvincing arguments of Maimonides. We know this reading of Maimonides as that of Leo Strauss, but historically it is nothing more than the zealous application to Maimonides of a remark that Averroes made in deprecation of the sincerity or rigor of al-GhazalT, applied in the context of a hostile metaphysic, an Averroistic double truth theory, and an exegetical awe which insists that a great thinker like Maimonides (or al- GhazalT) can be shown to have held no doctrines but the truth-so long as we do not too often attribute to the great philosopher the mistake of having meant simply what he said. Narboni's influential reading of Maimonides, as Hayoun notes, was still being studied by men like Salomon Maimon in the eighteenth century. But if our reading is correct, its influence persists today. Narboni wrote little biblical exegesis. A commentary on Lamentations in the manner of Gersonides is all there is for sure, although Narboni hoped to do another on the Song of Songs, and a commentary on Job has also been ascribed to him. Apparently he was content for the most part with the exegeses of Abraham ibn Ezra, which clearly outstripped the midrashic readings he had studied in his youth and paved the way for his own philosophical 4 For Hayy Ibn Yaqgzn see my English translation and commentary (New York, 1972; reprinted Los Angeles, 1983). 5 See Hayoun, p. 24.</page><page sequence="3">HAYOUN'S MOSHE NARBONI-GOODMAN 163 parshanut within the context of commentaries on the philosophic authors who become foils of his Averroism. As his remarks against isolation suggest, Narboni had a small but eager band of peers and followers in his native Perpignan. His philosophic works were addressed to these friends and to the larger community of scholars concerned with the same family of issues which he sought to resolve. He records with horror and compassion the sweeping away of many of these scholars, and lesser lights as well, in the civil commotions that accompanied the Black Plague of 1348-49, which he described in his medical writings, and which coincided with the apogee of his philosophic output. The experience of these dual horrors of natural and human evil did not drive Narboni closer to the escapist mysticism that was gaining ground in his day. Rather it confirmed the idleness of those who boasted that the human condition was above that of the angels-or who imagined that special providence somehow exempts some portion of the earth from the laws of nature-if only one knew the proper words of command. The mind, however, was another thing. Once freed of the attachments of the body, it did reach the divinely vouchsafed hypostasis of the Active Intellect and enjoy a knowledge and endurance that realize its true affinity with God. Rational mysticism and the monopsychism that al-FarabT, Ibn Sina, Ibn Bajjah, Ibn Tufayl, and Ibn Rushd had salvaged from the neoplatonic reading of Aristotle and ex- pounded, each with increasing clarity, were not the superstitious pursuit of protec- tion or propitiation that passed for religion among the vulgar. Indeed the same higher truth was the ultimate inner teaching of Maimonides. Oddly enough, Narboni's assumption of an esoteric sense in the Guide does not skew his commentary beyond compensation in the direction of overinterpretation. Rather, it has the effect of rendering explicit many issues that Maimonides leaves just below the surface, making the commentary a vehicle in its own right of its author's thought, without vitiating its usefulness in exposing a thematic structure in Maimonides' often dialectical exposition. Narboni will talk of substantial forms where Maimonides would never do so in so many words; his Maimonides is the author of the early handbook of logical terminology, on which Narboni also wrote a commentary. Preservation of Maimonidean ambiguities and economies is the furthest object from his intention. And when it comes to issues like providence and immortality, the issues for Narboni and for all the thinkers whom he most closely follows, explicitness is a help to the interpreter, albeit not the kind of help that the most profound religious thinkers on these topics characteristically looked for. Narboni's clear and sinewy Hebrew is a real aid to him in his project. Regrettably the author's clarity and directness, and often the plain sense as well, are not well served in the present translation, which appreciates many of the niceties of the original but frequently loses the forest for the trees and verges insecurely into the overtechnical and unmeaning. Thus, in the opening passage, Narboni writes: "Since the fulfillment of the human soul depends on that of the moral and intellectual virtues. . . ." (nHayoun rnders. tiin terms ofM "de v n ntnhq etn dno . .. nnbu&gt;;).Hayoun renders this in terms of "des vertues 'ethiques et diano'e-</page><page sequence="4">164 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tiques." Wooden enough, but still intelligible-barely. But for the opening com- ment on Guide 1. 1, we get: fl'?1Ke 77vivW nu&gt;X n MI.-; tD -7:2 " jnnn .ny M1VY?W1, which I would render: "Selem. He begins with this because it is our ultimate goal, and what is first in thought is last in action." Hayoun gives us: "Il a commence par ce sujet car il constitue la fin ultime. Il faut d'abord la pensee et ensuite l'action." Narboni's remark is a thoughtful gloss, qualified as such by the echo of the well-known liturgical phrase about the Sabbath (thus alluding to man's ultimate and timeless felicity), 77rrn MVrnnn 7TVY?n )1O. Narboni wants to show us a thematic allusion even in the seemingly arbitrary choice of the first term to be discussed in the Guide: For what the book is really about, Narboni argues, is the perfection or fulfillment (n1n?uV) of our rational capacities, which Maimonides will identify as the true referent in the seeming anthropomorphism of saying that man was created in God's image and likeness (fln?71 M5Y). Hayoun turns Narboni's effort to make Maimonides come forward with his themes into something more textbookish than the original, opaque at times, and (in the name of precision) often thick and inaccurate. Narboni expresses the following Philonic, ultimately Platonic, thought, which he derives from al-Farabi and Ibn Tufayl: "Now the Torah sets forth the ethical virtues at some length, for its first part, properly understood, is for the wise in particular, although made accessible in a certain manner to the masses, insofar as the popular imagination permits, whereas the second part is particularly laid down for the masses, to keep them under control; but its requirements are pleasant and natural to those who are wise and perfect. So fulfillment for the soul must abide within the divine Torah. Only there is an apparent quarrel between science and the Torah, stemming from their divergent manners of portraying truths, either for the understanding of the many or for that of the chosen few who are wise. But the Torah was intended specifically for the masses because they are the majority, and they were its first recipients. That is why it engenders confusion for the wise who study it, to the point that their perplexity grows to an affliction." This becomes: "Or la Tora explicite longuement les vertues dianoetiques, car la premiere partie est dans sa realite destinee en propre aux savants, mais on peut, dans une certaine mesure, en resumer les grandes lignes a l'intention de la foule conformement a l'imagination du vulgaire. La second partie est au contraire reservee et elaboree a l'intention de la foule pour laquelle elle est une contrainte; et cela est convenable et naturel pour les savants parfaits. (Par consequent, au vu de tout ce qui precede) il faut que la perfection de l'ame se trouve dans la Tora divine oui elle (la perfection de l'ame) a elu domicile. Il semble, a premiere vue, qu'il existe une controverse entre la Tora et la science car la mode de conception des choses vraies varient selon qu'il s'agit de les faire entendre a la foule qui est la plus nombreuse et qui est aussi celle a qui elle fut donnee au premier lieu, ou a quelques rares sages elus. Cet etat de choses entraine une confusion pour le sage qui scrute (sous l'angle de la speculation) la Tora de sort qu'il est deroute (perplexe) et ressent un trouble violent."

I do not wish to proliferate examples. Dr. Hayoun has performed a valuable service in making available an interesting and influential text. He has clarified the chronology of Narboni's works through painstaking but effortlessly presented collation of the author's self-citations and laid out clearly the state of present knowledge about this interesting figure and his backgrounds and milieu, carefully crediting the published editions and translations of Narboni's works by Altmann,6 Ivry,7 Bland,8 and himself,9 and the study by Touati, as well as noting the locations of the relevant MSS in Paris, Moscow, Leiden, Munich, and elsewhere. His notes are similarly thorough in citing the parallels in the tradition from al-Farabil to al- Ghazall and Ibn Rushd and from Saadiah to Gersonides and- Abarbanel-although somewhat frustrating in the economy with which they assume ready access to rather inaccessible journals and monographs. The damage done by the prevailing conventions in medieval translation is not the fault of a single author. It is up to all of us to correct it. University of Hawaii L. E.
