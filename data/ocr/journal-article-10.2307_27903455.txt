<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wittgenstein and the Diversity of Animals One of the reasons which has induced philosophers to enquire about animal psychology is the hope of arriving at a more precise understanding of human mental faculties. For example, in relatively recent times, this motive was evident among various authors of the seventeenth century, who were more or less directly influenced on the issue by Descartes. Over and above the varying lines which they pursued, what they most often have in common, is an essentially anthropocentric approach to the study of animals. The general categories which they used were mainly defined by specific reference to "human nature," (making use, at times very freely, of the scientific knowledge available in their age). The identity of this nature was to be highlighted by the complex of differences from, and sim ilarities to, that of the animals. As may become apparent by the end of this essay, Wittgenstein differed in several ways from this tradition of thought. His main objective does not seem to have been so much that of defining "human faculties" by taking animal psychology as a term of comparison, but rather that of re flecting on the possibilities and limits of human communication with other living species. As I shall seek to demonstrate, in at least certain decisive respects his viewpoint shows full methodological and thematic autonomy from that of scientific research into animal life (physiology, comparative animal psychology, ethology, etc.). It concentrates more on the "gram matical" aspects connected with the problem of communication between humans and other animal species, and the main instrument of enquiry that it uses is language: that of humans and, where appropriate, that of animals. However, as we shall see, alongside these theoretical aspects, which remain constant throughout the mature writings of Wittgenstein, others undergo perceptible modification, especially in the last phase of his thought.

In particular, we shall see that many difficulties are due to the assumption of human language as the only possible paradigm to describe and interpret the behaviour of other forms of life, and thus also their specific "languages." This creates an inevitable asymmetry in our relations with animals, which is revealed in a tendency by humans to homologize their forms of life. It does not seem that these problems can be dealt with by following the same route that Wittgenstein takes when he examines other forms of "gram matical" asymmetries which are to be found in the use of language, in particular those which in an exclusively human environment are at the basis of the problem of knowledge of other minds. It is only in the large body of unpublished material dating from the last stage of Wittgenstein's output, and especially in Remarks on the Phi losophy of Psychology, that references to animal psychology become more frequent and less causal. Not only so: here the problems which we have already mentioned are looked at from a new perspective. As we shall see, from Wittgenstein's fragmentary and unsystematic observations there emerges a theoretical preoccupation with recognising the substantial diversity of animal life-forms in contrast to those of human beings. This, however, does not prejudice the possibility of communication between species, even in cases in which this is limited to certain restricted functions and interactive contexts. This radical diversity (otherness) is actually kept hidden by the use of human language. Thus its recognition cannot be justified on the basis of scientific knowledge, or philosophical arguments, which make use of language, but is manifested instead in a "spontaneous," "instinctive" and "practical" readiness, aimed at an un derstanding of animals based on what Wittgenstein sometimes calls "sympathy." Apart from its intrinsic interest, this perspective also signals the reaffirmation of the primacy of ethics in the thinking of this philoso pher, for it points out a way of transcending the limits proper to human language without lapsing into nonsense. 1. in Philosophical Investigations, there are two passages in which the problem of relations with other forms of animal life is dealt with in a non-causal way. It is not hard to understand that, in their lapidary brevity, they may seem obscure in some ways, if not directly paradoxical or far removed from common sense.</page><page sequence="3">536 GUIDO FRONGIA It is sometimes said that animals do not talk because they lack the mental capacity. And this means: "they do not think, and that is why they do not talk." But?they simply do not talk. Or to put it better: they do not use language?if we except the most primitive forms of language. Commanding, questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our natural history as walking, eating, drinking, playing. (PI, 25) One can imagine an animal angry, frightened, happy, startled. But hopeful? And why not? A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master will come the day after tomorrow? And what can he not do here??How do I do it??How am I supposed to answer this? Can only those hope who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of language. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this compli cated form of life. (If a concept refers to a character of human handwriting, it has no application to beings that do not write.) (PI, , p. 174) The first impression that one receives on reading these two passages is that Wittgenstein means here to reassert, in his own fashion, an opinion which has frequently been maintained in the context of Western philo sophical tradition. It consists of tracing a clear demarcation between human beings and the other animal species. For example, this notion was still being justified by many authors of the seventeenth century by at tributing to human beings a superior intellective faculty: that associated with "thought" (the anima rationalis of the scholastic tradition). Excluded from this higher realm of mental functions, animals could then only be as similated to humans by their "lower" functions (those connected with anima sensitiva) some of which are in fact mentioned in the second passage above?anger, fear, physical pain, and so on. However, as can be seen clearly from these passages themselves, Wittgenstein differs in at least one important point from this way of un derstanding the distinction between men and other species of animals. This distinction is not centered by him on the faculty of "thinking," but on language. A dog cannot "hope" because he does not, in the proper sense of the word, have a "language." And it may be useful to remember that "hoping," at least in its more elaborate forms, was often traditionally included among the superior mental functions, as part of the category of "thinking." Wittgenstein's position, therefore, also takes on a certain his torical importance in this context. I think it is reasonable to hold that "the most primitive form of language" which Wittgenstein is here disposed to concede to the animals</page><page sequence="4">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 537 is that which they express by their behaviour, or by the very diverse systems of signals (acoustic, optical, and also olfactory, chemical, elec tromagnetic, etc.) which they emit for the purpose of communication with other members of their own species, or with different species, including men. It is undeniable that, however relatively "primitive" these languages may be (and even though they do not allow the carrying out of all those functions which Wittgenstein reserves for humankind in the above passages), they nevertheless constitute highly sophisticated systems of communication, as can be seen from the extensive studies carried out, for instance, in the context of the broad discipline known as zo?semiotics. We have only to call to mind the communication systems of the bees or of some marine mammals, or of the anthropomorphic apes. However, to confine the discussion to the example cited by Wittgen stein, we shall seek to trace the logical route which led him to the conclusion that an animal like the dog, which in some ways is so "intelli gent," even though incapable of using "language," i.e., the same language as that used by men, could not share with the latter such a simple sentiment as hoping that its master (to whom it is obviously attached by great affection) will return very shortly. Is it necessary to deny the dog a sentiment of this kind merely because it is incapable of giving a specific location in time to its hopes of its master's return? The exclusion of "hoping" from the mental faculties of the animal is justified in the passages cited on the grounds of a "grammatical" compar ison with some uses of "believe." In fact, if a dog cannot "hope," he can at least "believe" that his master is arriving behind the closed door. It is not hard to imagine contexts in which the latter verb is used here in a "grammatically correct" way: perhaps someone is approaching with a step exactly like that of his master; or possibly the scent from his clothing has reached the nostrils of the poor animal; or perhaps the latter was in a state of half-wakefulness and was deceived by a dream, or a false alarm, and so on. Someone seeing his joyful reaction, knowing that things are not, or cannot be, as he expects (let's suppose that his master is dead or a long distance away), will say "That dog believes...." In the case of "hoping," on the other hand, Wittgenstein seems to hold that this concept acquires its many-sided variety of meanings only when it is used in the context of the human "form of life," and that only in that context can it find an "application" which is "grammatically" correct. One of the many uses which is frequently made of this concept, he notes in the</page><page sequence="5">538 GUIDO FRONGIA passage quoted, is by placing it in relation to the expectation of an event which is situated, more or less precisely, in time. One may ask a human being, for example, when he thinks that this hoped-for event will take place; or make him understand that his estimates of timing are incorrect, and so on. None of this use of language, Wittgenstein seems to say, is possible with animals. If we tried to apply those uses to them, this would merely be a parody of what takes place normally in relations between humans. And if?perhaps because of affection or feeling for our dog?we insisted on using the verb 'to hope' to describe some aspect of its behaviour (saying, for instance, that it is 'hoping' where we would normally use 'believing') we would be also obliged to admit that we are making improper use of a concept which has its real meaning in a radically different context. Our feelings towards the animal are not enough to change this objective fact. Animal "hope" can never, for these "grammat ical" reasons, become part of our image of the animal "form of life," even of the most "evolved" forms or those which seem capable of entering into some sort of symbiosis with human beings. 2. However, on further reflection, if the interpretation of the passages from Wittgenstein which we are suggesting here is correct, it does not seem enough to establish such a sharp separation between 'believing' and 'hoping', and even less to arrive at such clear-cut conclusions. Most im portantly, it could be noticed that even though in some cases human beings "hope" for events which will take place at a given moment in the future, this specific temporal location of the event is not always necessary. Human beings can allow that they have the vaguest and most nebulous hopes, without this meaning that they are obliged, for reasons of consis tency, to specify when they expect that the "hoped-for" event will take place. Certainly, as Wittgenstein states in the passage quoted, we may have some hesitation when faced with the dog who is whimpering before the closed door, about saying that "he is hoping that his master is coming" (we would perhaps prefer to say more correctly, "He is waiting for his master," or "He's unhappy because his master hasn't come," or "He's impatient," etc.). However, what would be in the way of saying, in the face of the obvious sadness or disappointment of the dog when he discovers that the sounds of the steps he heard were not those of his master, that he "was hoping that his master was on the way"? It is clear that this usage,</page><page sequence="6">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 539 like that of "believing" discussed above, does not imply any complicated operation with time, which is only attributable to humans. We are led to ask ourselves whether objections of the same type may not also be made in connection with the conception of "believing." By applying the method of Wittgenstein himself, it could be shown, for example, that this concept in human language is used in many differing ways (and thus assumes differing meanings), which it could never be thinkable to apply to a dog. To recall just some of the examples discussed, in On Certainty: it can be said of a human being that "he believes" (wrongly) that a certain event took place at a certain time in the past; or that "he believes" that the sun goes round the earth; or that "he believes" in the existence of life after death, and so on. Should we conclude, on the basis of all this, that the concept of "believing" is in overall terms much wider and more articulated when it is applied to human beings? Or that "believing," when applied to animals (or perhaps more accurately, to what we humans attribute to them as believing), is only a far more restricted sub-category of the far wider total range of uses which find their proper grammatical identity in the form of human life? Or indeed, that in certain cases, by analogy, we also attribute to the animals certain of these uses? But then, may it not be true that the same thing should also be allowed in the case of "hoping"? We should recognise at this point that many of the perplexities which we have outlined here do not seem to derive from the greater or lesser accuracy or exhaustive capacity in the possible grammatical distinctions in the uses of concepts such as "believing" and "hoping." Indeed, as Wittgenstein's own analyses have effectively shown, the analogies, the differences, the connections and oppositions which can be traced at the grammatical level between different concepts, expressions and linguistic areas, form a highly complicated network of relationships which it is not possible to reconstruct in its entirety. An analysis which enters into this network has thus inevitably a circular, not a linear path. Every partial enquiry opens new and infinite possibilities of exploration in new areas? almost as if we were moving in an endless game of Chinese boxes. As Wittgenstein seems sometimes to recognise, at least implicitly, grammat ical observations may be useful for limited ends (to clarify, distinguish, specify, etc.), but they can never be exhaustive when we seek to use them to justify or contradict notions of wider theoretical application.</page><page sequence="7">540 GUIDO FRONGIA Many of the difficulties which can be found in the two quoted passages derive rather from the fact that they implicitly assume the existence of a single language: human language, in fact. If we take account of the various directions which Wittgenstein's enquiry takes in his later writings, we must understand the words "human language" here as including a broad class of variants "that are related to one another in many different ways." For example, historic languages like English or Chinese, but also those of the various "primitive" tribes pictured by Wittgenstein, and in addition the "new types of languages that may come into existence" (PI, 23). The "most primitive forms of language" which, as we have seen, Wittgenstein recognises as belonging to animals (in the relationship that we have with them and/or the relationship that we perceive within their social life), are to be considered as languages only inasfar as they can be approximated to some degree and in some aspects to human language. 3. These last conclusions would seem to be contradicted at least in part by another famous passage from Investigations, in which Wittgen stein actually concedes, albeit only for purposes of argument, that a lion might have the faculty of speaking. "If a lion could talk (sprechen) we could not understand him" (PI, II, p. 223; (LW, II, 190) is often consid ered indicative of the obscurity of Wittgenstein?hence because of the ironies which it has often provoked, not to mention certain extravagant in terpretations. We should remember that it also appears, in identical form, in Last Writings, although in the context of entirely different propositions. In effect, as its notorious reputation suggests, it may give rise to many per plexities in both versions. It would certainly make no sense to hold, as some have indeed held, that Wittgenstein, by putting forward the notion of a talking lion, was raising the problem of the vocal capacity of that animal, or of its ability to obtain the emission of sounds which imitate our spoken language, in a way not unlike what parrots do. The meaning of 'sprechen'?to talk?in accordance with the indications explicitly contained in the frequently cited PI 25, is in this case equivalent to "to use a language," independent ly of the fact that this language is or is not in colloquial form. The most frequent explanation of this passage is that here, for purposes of argument, (and so purely hypothetically), Wittgenstein is at tributing to the lion a somewhat more evolved language than those "primitive" ones which, as we have seen, seem to be allowed to all the animals (or at least to those better-known to us). The lion would therefore</page><page sequence="8">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 541 have the privilege of knowing how to use a human language, or at least a language which we humans might be capable of "mastering," wholly or in part. And the reason which is most frequently adopted to explain why we could not understand this lion is the enormous difference which divides his "form of life" from our own. This explanation is undoubtedly supported by the context in which the passage is found in Investigations. A little earlier, Wittgenstein in fact examines a case in which we may come into contact with the inhabitants of a country "with entirely strange traditions." This is a situation described by many anthropologists with regard to civilizations very distant from our own. The language of these people may seem at first completely incom prehensible, but then with careful observation of their habits, regular participation in their activities, with the perspicacity which can derive from the personal sensitivity and professional training of the anthropolo gist, the language may, little by little, be interpreted. At this point it is possible to know "what they are saying to themselves" (ibid.). Perhaps, I would add, up to the point where it becomes possible for us to share with them a certain number of activities which require the use of oral language. However, despite this achieved "mastery of the country's language," we may arrive at the conclusion that "we do not understand the people," "we could not find our feet with them" (wir k?nnten uns nicht in sie finden). Indeed, as is added in RPP, II, 700, "we could not possibly make ourselves understood to them. Not even as we can to a dog." The association between the case of "strange people" and that of the lion may, however, falter somewhat on closer examination. In the first, Wittgenstein would seem to consider that the limits to our understanding of a people very distant from our form of life are not insuperable, at least in principle. These limits seem to be due mainly to contingent reasons: first to the fact that we were not born in that country, whose customs thus seem "strange" to us, but also to the fact that we have not yet succeeded in detaching ourselves from certain habits, beliefs or attitudes which are proper to the tradition and the culture in which we have been brought up. But this cannot represent a final obstacle to the possibility that at a certain point we may be able to bridge the gap of incomprehension which separates us from very different cultures. However, to return to the case of the lion, we must note that it is treated by Wittgenstein with a categorical expression (" . .. we could not understand him"?wir k?nnten ihn nicht verstehen), which seems gram</page><page sequence="9">542 GUIDO FRONGIA matically to exclude, in any possible case, our capacity to understand him. That lion would remain in all circumstances "a complete enigma" to us, despite his extraordinary ability to speak our language. Why is this severity shown towards such a well-endowed and well-intentioned king of the forest? Is this distinctive treatment sufficiently explained by the fact that the distance which separates us from the "form of life" which prevails in a human "strange country" would nevertheless be much less than the one which separates us from the lion, even though he takes on some humanoid characteristics? But is a quantitative criterion of this kind suf ficient to lead us to the conclusion of incommunicability in principle? 4. The obscurity and apparent incongruity of the passage about the lion are undeniably a further proof of the complexity of the problem with which we are faced. The assumption of human language as a paradigm of all other language is, however, explicitly recognised in another part of the Investigations. "I want to say: it is primarily the apparatus of our ordinary language, of our word-language, that we call language; and then other things by analogy or comparability with this" (PI, 494). And it seems clear that when he says "we," in this passage, Wittgenstein is not referring to a cultural-anthropological category, as he was in the case mentioned above of the "strange country," where that pronoun applied to those belonging to a "form of life" shared by possible readers of his writings. The complex of adjacent propositions shows quite clearly that he is referring here to "we human beings" and is thinking of a juxtaposition between human language and other forms of languages, among which there are those of the animals, without taking account of the various distinctions which may be made within both classes. In the immediately preceding paragraph, he observes: "We say: 'The cock calls the hen by crowing',?but doesn't a comparison with our language lie at the bottom of this?" (PI, 493; italics mine). In this last passage, Wittgenstein points out very clearly the danger which is involved in the assumption of "our" language as the only possible paradigm. With this language, we describe or interpret the forms of behaviour which are normal among the animals for the purposes of communication, and thus, in the last analysis, their language also. The image which we have of the latter cannot fail to be influenced by the language which we use to describe it. For example, we say that the cock "calls" the hen, because this term describes the class of signals which men</page><page sequence="10">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 543 utter in similar situations and for similar purposes to those which are at tributed to the lord of the hen-run. Naturally, it remains to be seen in what way these "analogies" are to be established. In the passages which follow that quoted above (PI, 493), concern ing the cock's crowing, Wittgenstein does not provide an answer to this open question, but tends to fade out, using a long series of questions which concern the Cartesian treatment of animals as natural automata. Thus the unfortunate reader is left alone to battle with the insidious question about the correctness of our (human) description of the cock's intention. In fact this brings us face to face again with a fairly general problem which philosophical reflection has had to deal with in the context of a wide variety of issues, including some differing greatly from the one with which we are faced here. For reasons of brevity, I will sum it up here in very rough terms, describing it as the "differentiation-homologation circle." If I want to point out the differences between two "objects" (of whatever nature), when describing them I cannot avoid using for both of them an identical network of concepts, criteria, grammatical rules, para meters, measuring operations, and so on: in a word, the same language. But the very fact of comparing them will render those two objects similar, at least in certain aspects; if nothing else, it will confirm their both being "objects." And vice-versa. Every linguistic operation intended to compare two objects in order to establish in what they are similar, must begin with the admission of their differences; if nothing else, of their being two objects. In effect, the identification of difference requires their homologa tion; and vice-versa: the homologation presupposes their difference. Now this circle does not appear to have grammatical implications of great philosophical importance if the two objects are equidistant as far as the language which makes the comparison between them is concerned. To give a few simple examples: this book and that book; the toothache which Mario is talking about today and the toothache he was talking about yesterday; the dream I had last night and the one I had the night before last; the first even number before 100 and the first even number immedi ately after it, etc. But if, as often happens in the cases we have been discussing here, a comparison is applied to aspects or concepts of human language, on the one hand, and animal language on the other, then the comparison is compromised by an unavoidable asymmetry. This arises</page><page sequence="11">544 GUIDO FRONGIA from the fact that this comparison is brought into play (and it could not be otherwise) by human language, which is itself the object of comparison. The consequence of this would seem to be a substantial reduction of what is animal to what is human. It is as if the balance of the "differentiation homologation" circle was damaged, resulting in the prevalence of the effect of a wider homologation to the advantage of what is human. We can provide an example of these general notions with the case examined by Wittgenstein with which we began these reflections. The concept of "believing" (as distinct from that of "hoping") seems applica ble both to men and to dogs and, as a concept that relates to both species, it seems to provide a bridge which, at least in this aspect, unites the two forms of living beings, or to some extent diminishes their difference. In reality this comparison represents a unilateral assimilation by one form with the other, in that these two forms of life are not equidistant in relation to the language which establishes these grammatical analogies. But a not dissimilar result may be obtained by the opposite operation. Even if we state, as we have already seen in the passage above, that a dog cannot "hope," we do not obtain the result of a clearcut differentiation in the form of canine life, because once again the prevalent effect is that of homolo gation, due to the fact that the grammatical comparisons are made with human beings as the paradigm. The grammatical situation which comes about when we compare our language with that of an animal species is thus completely different from one in which we might compare, say, the uses of "believe" or "hope" in two primitive societies equally distant from our own. At most, a compar ison of the first type could provide partial or quantitative indications, showing how, for instance, in some ways the distance that separates us from this or that species is greater or less. But a complete diversity (otherness) of a form of animal life could never be established by this means, in that it must in any case be made by using human language. There seems, then, to be some justification for the suspicion that when we interpret animal behaviour, not limiting ourselves to its purely observable aspects (eating, walking, etc.), we cannot avoid an essentially analogical use of concepts which we can only derive from our form of life. In a certain sense we are here lending the animals a small part of our humanity. In general, however, a "loan" involves the consent of its bene ficiary. But in the case of an animal? Can it be said to be consenting over such a matter?</page><page sequence="12">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 545 We should add that the projective effects which are produced in our description and interpretation of animal behaviour are accentuated by the holistic standpoint which characterises Wittgenstein's philosophy pro foundly, especially in the mature stage. This is also explicitly hinted at in the two passages cited at the beginning: language, "natural history" and the "complicated form of life" which characterise the human condition form a unitary and interdependent whole, in accordance with the cele brated formula: "to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life" (PI, 19). This means essentially that language becomes a "system" in which every individual part depends not only on the other parts, but also on its totality. No aspect which forms part of this totality can be examined (described, analysed, etc.) by abstracting it from the highly complicated network of links (grammatical, normative, pragmatic, and so on) which connects it to the others and to the whole. As we mentioned above, this explains why no philosophical problem can be treated analytically in isolated fashion. However, such a viewpoint renders this system a closed entity, impenetrable from the outside: a sort of Leibnitzean monad which lives by its own life, substantially alien to, and not commensurable with, other systems (which does not mean that it is not susceptible of change, of course). Furthermore, the delimitation of this system is not possible, either. In fact, as we have seen, the actual distinction between what is properly human and what is not (or rather, to follow Wittgenstein more closely, between what can only be "applied" to humans and what applies also to animals) can only be traced through human language. It is impossible to get out of this cage of (human) language, however many efforts we may make. It seems that the well known notion already put forward in the Tractatus (5.62) (though in a very different context) reappears here. According to this, the "limits of language" coincide with those "of that language which alone I understand." This conclusion will not be unwelcome to the many supporters of the belief in the profound continu ity between the early works of Wittgenstein and those of his mature period. But it is certainly destined, in other ways, to open up questions no less complex than those which we are faced with here. 5. The tendency towards the homologation of other living forms which is produced in this viewpoint through language (i.e., human lan guage) confers on human beings an absolute and irrevocable supremacy. This is far more widespread and deep-rooted than is generally admitted,</page><page sequence="13">546 GUIDO FRONGIA when reference is made to their biological predominance, for example, or their technical or pragmatic abilities. Here, through the mastery of language, man imposes himself in fact as a (logical) paradigm of an order of nature. And this is obviously accompanied by a responsibility propor tional to the uniqueness of this privilege. However, as the recent past has shown, man has not always used the power which derives from his bio logical position in a correct way, as regards other living forms and the natural environment. Indeed, especially in the writings of his last years, Wittgenstein showed a growing awareness of these problems, and of the uniqueness of their nature. The strategy by which he sought to deal with them is aimed in two different directions, which are, however, complementary to each other. The first is undoubtedly the better known. It consists of seeking to obtain a less schematic and inaccurate representation of the effective practice of communication which we succeed in setting up or which we may try to set up with different animal species. It is the usual invitation to rid ourselves of "philosophical" preconceptions, nourished perhaps by a "one-sided diet" of cases (PI, 593), which tends to disregard the great variety of forms which our relations with other animal species can assume: "I mean that I wouldn't say either of myself (or of others) that we understand manifestations of life that are foreign to us. And here, of course, there are degrees" (RPP, II, 30). However, I do not wish to dwell on this first strategy of attack, intended to give greater recognition to the variety of the intermediary grades. Indeed, not only is this strategy quite well-known, as we have mentioned before, but also a close analysis of it would require a long and complex work of reconstruction within his last writings. And this could be done only in the appropriate context. However, there are at least two general observations which are very germane to our enquiry. The first regards Wittgenstein's explicit appeal to the flexibility and sensitivity which are necessary, on a pragmatic level, to undertake com munication with other living species: "I want to regard man here as an animal; as a primitive being to which one grants instinct but not ratioci nation. As a creature in a primitive state. Any logic good enough for a primitive means of communication needs no apology from us" (OC, 475). So, not only is the lack of a common logical instrument not an obstacle to the search for communication with another species; not only would the</page><page sequence="14">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 547 recourse to human logical forms, such as those used in "ratiocination" (Raisonnement), be ineffective in this case, but (I would add) perhaps this procedure would also irreparably compromise any attempt to initiate a harmonic relationship with them. Most probably, this would create an in surmountable barrier of incommunicability, and perhaps, at least in some cases, a justified refusal on the part of those who, in unilateral fashion, we had chosen as our "partners in communicating." A grim solitude may thus be the price which human beings would pay for their (perhaps instinctive) tendency to anthropomorphize all their relationships, even on the practical plane. In this as in all other cases, the search for authentic communication demands that sensitivity which consists in perceiving the differences (at least the partial or virtual ones) and the humility of giving up at least part of our own nature out of respect for these differences. The second observation is that this perspective, aimed at recognising the variety of forms of inter-species communication, also makes it possible for a philosophical reflection to open up, without preconceived closures, to the great quantity of information which has been gathered on the scientific level (zo?semiotics, ethology, ethno-zoology, and so on), es pecially in recent decades, on the different animal languages. All this may clearly be of great importance. We should add, though, that this procedure is not sufficient in itself to avoid that homologation which takes place in our relations with animals, with all the results which we have observed. This obstacle cannot be overcome on the cognitive plane. The natural sciences are completely inadequate for re-establishing a linguistic symmetry between humans and other living forms. They are themselves compromised by the asymmetry caused by the prevalence of human language, since the latter is their principal instrument in interpreting reality. We must recognise that this problem has to be faced from stand points differing again from those we have already discussed. 6. These last observations can help us to deal more effectively with a further subject which can be seen lurking amid the labyrinthine twists of the manuscripts of Wittgenstein's last period. It is true this subject is barely sketched out, in scattered passages, in the midst of a multitude of other issues which are often left unexplored, and it would not be surpris ing if it passed unobserved. I mention it here not so much as to propose it as an exegetical solution to the questions raised, but above all because of its intrinsic interest, which would warrant a far wider theoretical treatment.</page><page sequence="15">548 GUIDO FRONGIA The series of passages in which this theme receives relatively more complete exposition is contained in the latter part of the second volume of Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology (especially 659-673). I reproduce the most salient points here because they seem to me to offer a significant theoretical alternative to those from which our reflections began. (...) The uncertainty whether a fly feels pain is philosophical; but couldn't it also be instinctive? And how would that come out? Indeed, aren't we really uncertain in our behaviour towards animals? One doesn't know: is he being cruel or not? (RPP, II, 659) For there is uncertainty of behaviour which doesn't stem from uncer tainty in thought, (ibid. 660) One kind of uncertainty is that with which we might face an unfamiliar mechanism. In another we should possibly be recalling an occasion in our life. It might be, e.g., that someone who has just escaped the fear of death would shrink from swatting a fly, though he would otherwise do it without thinking twice about it. Or on the other hand that, having this experience in his mind's eye, he does with hesitancy what otherwise he does unhesitating ly, (ibid. 669; Z, 561). The one uncertainty stems from you, so to speak, the other from him. The one could surely be said to connect up with an analogy, then, but not the other. Not, however, as if I were drawing a conclusion from the analogy! (RPP, II, 671; Z. 563) The "uncertainty" (Unsicherheit) of a philosophical nature which is referred to here is that connected with sceptical doubt about the effective existence of pain in animals, and of its comparability (on the basis of an analogy), with human pain (cf. also RPP, II. 558). This subject is here dealt with in the context of a rather more general discussion of the problem of knowledge of other minds. This latter theme is among those which have been more fully dealt with by an imposing exegetical and theoretical lit erature, and cannot be r?sum?d here even in summary form. It will be enough to note that it is approached in a substantially similar manner both in the case of men and of animals. Wittgenstein's well-known reply is that this problem rests on a series of misunderstandings about the functioning of language, and must thus be subjected to the severe examination of a "therapeutic" analysis. It should be noted, though, that the "philosophical uncertainty" connected with sceptical "doubt" is placed at exactly the opposite pole</page><page sequence="16">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 549 from the problem which we have raised in this essay. For the sceptic the main theoretical difficulty is to redeem a communication with other forms of life which seems to him compromised by the differences both at the bi ological level, and at the level of the respective "forms of life." The problem which we have raised here, on the other hand, is that of the in evitable homologation of the various animal species which seems to derive from a single linguistic paradigm. With regard to our discussion, a special importance has to be given to the second type of "uncertainty" which Wittgenstein in the last passages cited calls "instinctive" and also "practical and primitive" (RPP, , 558). It is connected with a "very peculiar" subjective reaction, which may occur, for instance, when one is faced with "those cases in which the inner seems hidden from me" (ibid.). Probably this reaction includes a combi nation of astonishment, consternation, impotence and hesitation. Its "instinctive" character is due to its immediacy, i.e., to the fact that it is not induced by intellectual calculation; in short, it falls into the class of cases in which "instinct comes first, reasoning second" (RPP, II. 689). Its "practical" aspect is due to the fact that it can have effects on the level of behaviour, as happens in the quoted example, where a spontaneous hesi tation takes place in provoking (physical or psychological) pain or death in an animal. In a more complete and conscious manner, this hesitation may be expressed in questions such as: "Am I cruel if I act like this?" or "Is it all right for me.... ?", "Should I... ?" or "Can I... ?." At least in some respects, these passages remind one of what Wittgenstein said in the Tractatus with regard to certain quite special ex periences, such as the sudden revelation of the fact that the world "exists" (6.44). In both cases, these experiences lead us to look with a somewhat different viewpoint at the things which are around us, and attribute new significance to them. This is an attitude of openness and receptiveness which neither philosophic ratiocination nor increased scientific knowledge would be capable of determining on their own. As we men tioned previously, the latter can also help us to form a less narrow image of ourselves?in some cases, even a less anthropomorphic image of the various forms of animal life, highlighting certain diversities which may escape everyday observation or common experience. But it is certain that these broadenings of awareness and perspective may also not be in them selves sufficient to produce an attitude which is ethically more conscious. Indeed, we cannot forget the countless examples of civilisation, present or</page><page sequence="17">550 GUIDO FRONGIA past, which have produced levels of scientific knowledge which we, by our standards, would perhaps consider very restricted, and which never theless succeeded in establishing rather more harmonious and less aggressive relations with the animals than we have done, for all our baggage of objective knowledge and methodological rigour. 7. With emphasis which is unusual for him, Wittgenstein introduces into these late writings a further notion to designate this special way of relating to other forms of animal life which surround us. "What is essential for us is, after all, spontaneous agreement, spontaneous sympathy" (RPP, II, 699). The spontaneity which he attaches to this notion of "sympathy" (Mitleid, Sympathie) agrees quite well with what we have already said in relation to those "instinctive" reactions which may induce us to respect towards animal pain and life, and which can cause us to become hesitant and problematical (unsicher) where otherwise we might proceed without hesitation. I think that some observations are needed, with the aim of prevent ing certain predictable misunderstandings on the meaning of this notion of "sympathy." First of all, it is kept free by Wittgenstein from the senti mental connotations which not only common sense but also certain philosophers have attributed to it. The fact that in the quoted passage, for instance (RPP, II, 659), he refers "particularly to lower animals" (flies, spiders, etc.; see also RPP, II, 667) seems significant to me. These species are usually considered "unattractive," and their forms of life are among the least anthropomorphic, hence least adapted to arousing sentimental in volvements or protective emotions on the part of humans. This aspect, too, can have a great practical (ethical) importance. We may think, for example, of how intrusive and cruel, the apparently pro tective and solicitous attitudes which are reserved for our "domestic" animals can sometimes be; or more generally how much ambiguity there may be in what is often called "love" for animals. Naturally, an affection ate attitude here is not negative in itself, or to be condemned. But it is certain that when it tends to reflect a complete homologation of other living species, it can become very damaging, since it may lead us (even though unconsciously) to deny the animals any autonomy of their own. The second observation to be made is that Wittgenstein seems to dis tinguish his notion of "sympathy" quite sharply from that of "under standing," at least where the latter is meant to designate only our capacity</page><page sequence="18">WITTGENSTEIN AND THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS 551 to predict (and to "explain" on the basis of such prediction) animal behaviour. "Even when I 'do not rest secure in my sympathy' (Mitleid), I need not think of uncertainty about his later behaviour" (RPP, II, 670). Therefore (see also RPP, , 667), that understanding which makes us capable of carrying out practical activities with animals for entirely in strumental or utilitarian purposes (say, when we use them as providers of work, or as means of transport, or to exploit some particular perceptive ability they may have, etc.) has certainly very little to do with the "sympathy" of which we are speaking here. And the reverse is true: the latter may exist even where, as we have seen in the case discussed above, we are faced with beings "with entirely strange traditions," to the point that "we could not find our feet with them" (PI, II, p. 223). Here another objective limit can be perceived, which characterises our relations with the animals, even on the practical level. Even if they were reduced to their purely exploitative and utilitarian aspects, these re lationships would remain substantially different from those which we carry on with human beings for the same purposes, at least in our societies (for the sake of simplicity, I am not taking account here of societies based on slavery). This is because, for example, in giving a value to the perfor mance of an animal, we can never negotiate a price or a recompense with them; neither could we apply criteria of mutual benefit which (in more or less tacit ways) are at the basis of much of the activity carried on in the context of human coexistence. Indeed, there is no animal species with which we could demand respect for the principle such as: "Sometimes I treat him as I treat myself, and as I would like to be treated when I'm in pain" (RPP, , 677), when this principle refers to a mutual exchange of benefits. As can be seen, all these considerations, although very diverse in character, lead constantly in one direction, which lays great stress on human responsibility to the other living species. This responsibility can not do other than express itself in self-limitation on the part of mankind of its own conditions of privilege and predominance. Thus, that notion of "spontaneous sympathy," although subjective in its original acceptance, and essentially linked to a personal experience, suggests general princi ples of great moral importance. It may be extended so as to produce an attitude which is completely disinterested and devoid of any kind of cal culation, even when it is aimed at apparently farsighted objectives, such</page><page sequence="19">552 GUIDO FRONGIA as the preservation of the natural environment or the saving of the animal and material resources which this offers. In fact it is clear that even these objectives could be pursued only in the context of a rationalisation and strengthening of human biological predominance. The fragments of Wittgenstein which we have examined here seem effectively to indicate the possibility of considering every living being (to whatever species it may belong) not only as a means, but also as an end in itself. They tend to give us back the sense of a radical diversity of the various species of animals which surround us, a diversity which the use of (human) language does tend to make uniform. The principle which in spires the fragments is a genuine ethical awareness of the particular nature of the relationship which links us as humans to other living forms. The means which they seem to indicate is a unilateral and disinterested gen erosity on the part of humans, aimed at recognising equal dignity to all other animal species. And what is also remarkable is that this moral principle is (implicitly) stated in such a way as not to interfere, theoreti cally and practically, with what little or much there is of communication in our relations with the animals?including in the latter class those relations based on a practical and utilitarian plan. As Wittgenstein had ac knowledged even many years earlier, an ethical insight may be the best way of escaping from the cage of language. University of Rome, Italy Guido Frongia</page></plain_text>
