<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 1 A DREAM AND A DELUSION IN OZ'S HAMATZAV HASHLISHI by Harris Lenowitz Harris Lenowitz is Professor of Hebrew in the Department of Languages and Literature and the Middle East Center at the University of Utah. He teaches Hebrew language and literature, Aramaic, and Ugaritic. It is difficult to talk about the work of Amos Oz without considering his politics and his biography too. It seems that his physical body may even have its place in any consideration of his work. Oz has been the crown prince of Hebrew prose since the Sixties, clothed in the native dress of his upbringing among the socialist, intellectual aristocracy, his pure Zionism, his kibbutz background and his experience of Jerusalem and the Hebrew University before the fall. His mother's suicide when he was 12, his moves to the kibbutz (Hulda), then back to the city and finally out to the dry air of Arad parallel the themes of estrangement and the actions and psycholo- gy of his alienated heroes. His light colored hair, his clear eyes, and his sculpted features stamp him as fit for the role he has played. His crystalline linguistic skills give the picture the sort of stunning permanence proper to (an Israeli) Achilles.1 Israelis attend to his writing and his political activities, and his automobile accident in 1976 engaged the attention of the nation. He is something of a symbol. This tends to overwhelm critics and leave them to emphasize at random and passionately some particular aspect while thinking of something else entirely. His style may be the ^Most of this summary appears at the beginning ofYehudit Oryan's review of Hamatzav hashlishi (Jerusalem: Keter, 1990; all translations quoted in this article are my own) in Yediot aharonot (January 4, 1991). Other important reviews include those mentioned below and those of Batya Gur in Ha'aretz of January 11, 1991 and Gavriel Moked in Akhshav 56 (Spring 1991), pp. 305ff.

His politics may be the topic, but then his fictional heroes are taken as figures representing his own biography and political position.2 Oz participates actively, coyly at times, in promoting this confusion. He makes stories of his own life in interviews anyway. His grandfather's offer to see to his sexual provisioning if he hadn't done so himself by the age of seventeen is a favorite tale, appearing slightly modified in the interviews with Helit Yeshurun and with Frederick Goldman.3 Yet Oz has said to me that he feels a close kinship to Sumkhi (the hero of his "novel for youth"), and at least one other writer feels that Hamatzav hashlishi is closely connected to Sumkhi , perhaps its continua- tion.4 It would be better to concentrate on the politics, psychology, and sexuality in the life of a character in a novel written by Oz than to see the character through Oz-colored glasses. To do so means to get a hold on how Oz determines in the work itself the way we are to read his work cum life. A dream- the field on which such hidden-and-exposed representations are played out- is the focus of this paper. We are all most helplessly and completely exposed in our dreams- even those we dream through characters we invent to dream- so that understanding what this one dream conveys concerning its dreamer and in particular how it does so is a valuable first step on the several different expeditions mentioned. The dream comes from Hamatzav hashlishi (The Third Condition) (a recent English translation [New York, 1993] titles the work Fima ), Oz's latest novel. The novel delivers classically Freudian conflicts; its portrayal of those conflicts is epitomized in the hero's dreams, the classic place for such revelations, and the method for revealing them is that of dream analysis, though this at least we are left to do for ourselves. In fact, our role is that of the analyst. We are reading Fima's story, written by Oz as Fima is writing the journal of his dreams. The novel tells the story of five days in the life of Efraim ("Fima") Nisan (formerly Nomberg). Fima is divorced, in his mid-fifties, living in Jerusalem in a small and unkempt 2The confusion of all this is overwhelming (cf. Oryan's review mentioned in n. 1). Less passionate but still laboring to see through Oz's fiction to his politics is the richer review by Nitza Ben-Dov in the Supplement to the same newspaper, "The Brown Dream Journal." Books about Oz (all in Hebrew) are more restrained and better focused, particularly the two of Avraham Balaban, Between God and Beast and Towards Language and Back. I would say that the newspaper and journal book reviews reflect the excitement and confusion and interest their readerships have in the varieties of Oz. ^he conversation with Yeshurun is in Hadarim 8; the one with Goldman, m Midstream (December 1991). *Ben-Dov, Supplement, p. 24.</page><page sequence="3">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 3 apartment in Kiryat Yovel and working as a receptionist/clerk in a small obstetric/gynecological clinic.5 After a brilliant beginning towards what seemed destined to be an academic and literary career in his youth, Fima has faltered into a depressing loneliness which he shares with a number of women lovers and two or three households of friends from his brighter days (including his former wife, Yael, her husband Ted, and their child Dimitrios, "Dimi"). Fima is overweight and careless of his appearance. He is also highly intelligent and perceptive, a genuine liberal with deep concern for others and his responsibility towards them, and occasionally manic. He spends his free time reading newspapers, writing occasional pieces on politics and the language of politicians for " Ha'aretz ," in love affairs and visiting his friends. His mother, who died when he was ten, seems to have called the boy Efraim; his divorced wife calls him Efifi. But Efraim is called "Fima" by his father and the narrator, a nickname which points away from Hebrew (by the unacceptable, as Fima himself might point out, allophone) towards the galut and specifically towards Russian and Slavic (where the same nickname is used for the name Yefim as well). The association with Russian literary figures is confirmed by Fima's resem- blance, often pointed out in the novel, to characters from Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol, and Pushkin.6 He, like they, is unable to find purpose, to make and carry out decisions, particularly those which concern the meaning of his own life. His slavic identity along with the nickname has been given to him by his father, Barukh Nomberg. Barukh is of central European origin and is the founder and operator of a middle-sized perfume factory in Israel. He has provided Fima with an apartment to live in as part of a marriage gift. In return he has extracted Fima's promise to finish his graduate degree. He gives Fima occasional pocket money and generally shows concern for his care, as do all his friends, though Fima is something of a bother. At the end of the five days Barukh Nomberg dies a natural death and Fima is launched onto a new life, inheriting his father's apartment and business. The following dream presents the central issue of the novel. 5A. B. Yehoshua's Molkho has its own gynecology clinic too. Oz and Yehoshua are often compared given their differing origins and similar politics. In this matter, procreation and offspring, there is ground for comparisons between their writing and their politics and their visions of the generations in Israel. Perhaps this paper will provide some data in which to ground such comparisons. 6Gur (n. 1) finds important similarities between Fima and Oblomov (in Goncharov's novel).</page><page sequence="4">4 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 The Third Condition , Chapter 7, "With his thin fists" At six fifteen in the morning, he recorded in the brown dream book what he had seen during the night. He laid an anthology of poems about Jerusalem on his upraised knees to use as a desk. He noted the date, as always, with words rather than numbers. In the dream, war had broken out. The place was like the Golan Heights, only dryer. Like on the surface of the moon. He was walking along an abandoned, dusty path in an army uniform but without either a belt or weapons. Minefields stretched out on both sides of the road. He particularly recalled that the air was gray and thick as though before a storm. From a great distance the sound of a bell ringing slowly, between long pauses, could be heard echoing through unseen valleys. Lengthy silences fell between the claps. Nothing alive was around. Not even a bird. Nor any sign of a settlement. Once more they Ve taken us by surprise. A column of enemy armor drew nearer to a narrow mountain pass, a sort of cleft which Fima noticed along the rise in the road where the foothills began. He understood that the greyness of the air was due to the dust rising from the tracks of the vehicles. Once he figured this out, he noticed the sound of their motors under the ringing of the bell, a low hum. Somehow he knew that it was his duty to wait for them in the mountain cleft, where the path crossed the mountain pass. To talk and delay them until a force could be raised and get there to block the canyon. He started running as hard as he could. His breath rasped. The pulse of his blood beat in his temples. His lungs hurt. There were stabbing pains in his ribs. He ran with all the strength that was in his muscles and still seemed to make no progress, almost running in place while searching in a panic for words that he could use to slow up the enemy. He had to find some expression right away, an idea, a greeting, perhaps even something funny to say, words that would cause the column driving towards him to stop, to stick up their heads from inside their hatches, to listen to him. Even if he couldn't change their minds, at least he could gain some time. Otherwise it was hopeless. But his strength was fading and his feet were stumbling and his head was empty. He couldn't think of a single word. The hum of the motors drew nearer, grew louder. He could already hear the thunder of artillery and the barking of machine guns around the curve of the road. And he saw Hashes in the cloud of smoke or dust which filled the cleft and filled his eyes and burned his throat. He was too late. He would never get there in time. There weren't any words in the world which could stop the charge of the enraged ox rolling towards him. Any moment now and he'd be trampled. Yet his terrible fear was exceeded by the shame he felt at failing. At the loss of words. His maddened race slowed and his feet tangled together as some sort of weight descended upon him and pressed down on his shoulders. When he managed to tum his head around he saw that a child was riding</page><page sequence="5">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 5 on him, drumming on his head with vicious, skinny fists and squeezing his throat between its knees.7 He started to choke. In addition, Fima registered in his notebook: "The sheets smell already. Today I have to take them to the laundry. Yet something remained: a longing for those empty hills and the strange, grey light, and especially for the sound of the bell which echoed in long pauses through the desolate wadis, and seemed to come to me from an unimaginable distance." The novel itself asserts that dreams are the key to its central mysteries in the very first sentence: "Five nights before the disaster Fima had a dream which he recorded at five-thirty in the morning in his dream journal." We are not told the nature of the disaster which is to come; but the dream, the dreamer, and the narrator all know: the dream is dreamt now but knows five days into the future; the narrator recalls what is most memorable to him of the experience of the dreamer of the dream, though both continue to disguise and conceal certain horrible truths from themselves. On the same page, we are told that Fima "found fewer lies while he slept than while he was awake." The irony in which Fima makes the opening observation marks his fear before the awareness that he tells himself the truth when he dreams, and that he dreads the truth. The central figure in the dream of chapter seven is the one which appears at the end of the dream. In discussing this figure I would like first to restate some parts of Freud's study of how dreams work in novels and of how they are made in the first place, the "dream-work." We must un-work the work which Fima has done in creating the immobilized, strangling figure of the man with the boy on his shoulders. If we know what Fima is, we still don't know what has brought him to the inflexible captivity in which he exists, more or less comfortably but idly, uncreatively, and more and more pathologically. Generally, Freud's principles as stated in The Interpretation of Dreamt remain useful, particularly when the character (Fima) and his creator (Oz) can be assumed to be aware of Freud's work. Dreams are taken as wish-fulfillments (p. 122ff.) in which wishes are made apparent as well as distorted (p. 134ff.) by the liberating and restraining force of a censor which allows us to consider what we would not when awake, but 7The translation of the last few words of the Hebrew text as "shoved his [Fima's] head down between his knees, " in the English version of the novel, Fima (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1993), is an unfortunate error. 8All quotes are from The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (London, 1953, etc.).</page><page sequence="6">6 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 which continues to conceal some things from us. The distorting of the wishes is called by Freud " dream-work. " The distortion manipulates the raw material - images, sounds, words, etc.- which comes from the period of the day or two preceding the dream (p. I65ff.). Throughout the Interpretation of Dreams Freud reveals that his reading of a particular dream is a likely one and then proves his contention by exhibiting several details from conversations that he has had over a long time and in some detail with the patient. These data Freud has concealed until he finds it useful to reveal them in support of his reading of the dream. Freud's dance-of-veils reveals his own awareness that very small details in the life of the patient may play an important part in the revelation and that these may not always be known to the analyst, even if the elements come from the previous day's experience for the most part. I would argue that Freud's approach is especially applicable to reading dreams in novels, since there can be no surprises in the self-contained world of the novel. Everything we need to know must be present. The world of the novel is complete in a way that other worlds are not. "Our author never introduces a single idle or unintentional feature into his story."9 As a scientist and medical doctor Freud, understandably, felt ambivalent about the fact that analyzing dreams in novels might work better than analyzing the dreams of real people in real life. Most of his feelings on the subject are present in the early paper mentioned above, the only one in which he actually analyzes dreams in a novel, "Delusions and Dreams in Jensen's Gradiva ." He gives voice to his doubts and hopes as priorities: "Are we perhaps under an obligation to replace each separate piece of the manifest content of the dream by unconscious thoughts? Strictly speaking, yes; if we were interpreting a dream that had really been dreamt, we could not avoid that duty. But in that case, too, the dreamer would have to give us the most copious explanations. Clearly we cannot carry out this requirement in the case of the author's creation ..." (p. 60). This statement conflicts with the previous one about the totally present evidence of the artifact. But in fact it will never be possible to gain the most copious explanation in life; and it will always be possible to do so in art, however less important it may be than life. Moreover, Freud felt odd- he writes that he is "far from believing that dreams foretell the future" (p. 7)- about the fact that dreams in novels really do tell the future. A present moment in novels is in touch with a single determined future exactly as it is in touch with its own determined past. As wish-fulfillments all dreams Vol. IX, "Delusions and Dreams in Jensen's Gradiva p. 68.</page><page sequence="7">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 7 are pointed towards the future. Equally, they all arise from structures which are present in the identity of the dreamer, constants of character. Most of the images in the dream above appear in the pages which precede it. These correspond to the material on which the dream-work operates in expressing the dreamer's conflicts. Thus when these same images recur after the dream, one cannot really speak of the dream as mantic. In speaking of dreams in novels one is limited to the images of the period preceding the dream, the closer to the dream the better, but those images may be (re-)encountered after the reader first inspects the dream. The five days we have of Fima's life in this novel, like Bloomsday, are a single psychic whole. The figures of the bell, the wasteland, and the valleys in Fima's dream provide good examples of what I mean. They are noteworthy for possessing a mysterious quality, inasmuch as they have no necessary connection with the plot of the dream. The bell: Clock alarms, church bells, telephone bells, doorbells are used to call attention to something. Yet Fima uses the image of bells to illustrate his theory about change and permanence to three Israeli girls in Greece and makes the observation that one may be summoned, or summon, to attend to the immutable disguised as something new. As Fima explains to his companions in Greece in his first discussion of states of existence and their mutations, "just as water changes its appearance on occasion to snow or mist or vapor of a lump of ice or wisps of cloud or hail. Just so, the bells of the monasteries and churches of the villages are different from each other in their rhythms and tones but their meaning is one and the same" (p. 21; and compare the bells of Jerusalem's memory, p. 71). In the dream which begins the novel, Fima encounters a woman at his desk in the clinic. She comes up to him from behind his counter and laughs when he tells her that she must go around to the front. "Even though I had no bell I said, 'Madam, if you don't come out from behind the counter I'll have to ring the bell.'" At which she laughs again (p. 7). Fima cannot move others with his bells, here or with his telephone calls to Yael (p. 15). Bells on clocks drag him up from his sleep, as they do his heroines, against his will. The great distance from which the bell is heard ringing in the dream is only as far as the distance between the bed and the nightstand, but the bell rings away in an active, changing world for him and even for the newscaster whom he pities (p. 95). Bells registering the passage of time mark the measure of one's impotence. Here they bring Fima's constant experience with the appointments and phone calls of the</page><page sequence="8">8 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 clinic's patients together with the countdown to the dead-end of Israel's relations with Moslems (p. 14). Fima is sympathetic to those calling and counting: the women are at the mercy of the doctors; the Arabs and Jews, at the disposition of the politicians. Fima can only register the calls. They don't do him any good even when they are answered. In fact he becomes sexually impotent when he makes the phone ring and his calls are answered (pp. 16, 49). Ultimately the bells of clocks and churches and gates mark at best the sad passage of lost opportunity: three musicians, older women, live and play their music together on the courtyard of the building in which the clinic is found. They are later incarnations of the three girls from Greece, Fima's Fates. Fima stands beneath their window, bemused, attempting to determine the tune they're playing and imagining first their lives, then their rooms, in particular their common room. The room itself is outside time, changeless though old, and its permanent resident is an old clock, "brown, with roman numerals as numbers." One of the women reads aloud to the others and the room is silent but for her voice, the sound of the fuel feeding the heater and the ticking of the clock. "At eleven o'clock precisely they rise and go, each to her room. Three doors close behind them until morning. And in the salon, in the deep silence and dark, the clock goes on. Ticking without cessation. And once an hour sounds a low chime" (p. 165). Some balanced and immutable ideal is Fima's grail (pp. 198, 207, 219f., 246). But the use of the word matzav (condition, situation) for what he seeks, a third way or state between two extremes of action, is ironic. It implies hopeless, neutral stasis, "the way things are," particularly as it is applied to Israeli politics. Fima is summoned to stasis by these bells. The young Fima seeks a mixture, a balance, a Platonic permanence which comes to jell as the mousse in which the fifty-seven-year-old Fima is deposited. "Neither wakefulness nor sleep, but the 'third condition,' equally close to being completely awake and deeply asleep," is one rendition of this "situation."10 The clock ticks off the fruitless passage of love and the failures of politics. It chimes Fima's lack of power to change. 10This is Eli Hirsch's formulation in Ha'ir of January 28, 1990, reviewing the novel.</page><page sequence="9">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 9 The wasteland: Before the dream there appear two descriptions of a landscape over which a darkening, thick air broods and in which no living being stirs. In the dream which initiates the novel, Fima finds himself following a woman he has never seen. She carries an infant whose face he wishes to see through alleys and courtyards into a misty rain as the air grows dark. Just before she comes to a halt and removes the watch from his arm, he notices that "We met no living being on the way. Not even a cat" (p. 8). When he wakes from the dream and looks out his window, everything seems distant and fog lies among the houses. "There was no sign of life outside. As if the dream continued" (p. 10). The material from before the dream sets the emotional stage for our understanding of the two components of the emptiness of Fima's waste- land, the lack of air and life, and comes from a dream itself. Fima is alone in a world which knows nothing of his existence, a world whose vital existence his own presence has extinguished. If he is present there, the world is elsewhere; if the world is present, Fima cannot be. The idea is materialized in the results of a political sequence Fima identifies as immutable, a nuclear war, which Fima requires be called a crime. Nothing less precise will do. He faces his own extinction bravely but wants someone to notice and suffer for his loss. He feels that his annihilation is a criminal act of cosmic importance, and he writes his despair over the face of the whole planet. "From his window Fima noticed how the sun was struggling to get free from the clouds. ... All the things that fill the lives of Uri Gefen and Zvi and Teddy and the rest of our group, the things which engage their desire and passion, seemed to Fima desolate, like the dead and rotting leaves at the foot of the bare berry tree in the courtyard" (p. 73). On a late night stroll through Jerusalem, "Striding easily, springy, awake and aware of the night's chill and drunk on the silence and emptiness, Fima made his way down through the neighborhood as if someone were playing a marching song for him. No living creature was about in the wet streets. Jerusalem had been put into his hands to defend from itself" (p. 92). As he waits for the kettle to boil to make his breakfast, "Fima rehearsed the history of the Korean war, the days of Truman and MacArthur and McCarthy, and reached the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The coming nuclear holocaust will not begin with the great powers but here with us. With our regional quarrel. The Syrians will storm the Golan heights with a thousand tanks, we'll blow up Damascus, they'll</page><page sequence="10">10 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 reply with a salvo of missiles against the cities along the coast, and we'll set off the doomsday mushroom. No living thing will be left here in another hundred years" (p. 97). On the taxi drive home from Yael's Fima attends to a ghostly light which illuminates the fog. "A glow not of this world. He shivers suddenly. As if the words themselves come to us from there, from other worlds. No vehicle appeared. No light could be seen in any window. The desolation of the asphalt square, the play of light from the headlights, the shadows of black pines which stood wrapped in the rain as after a final closing, aroused a weighty fear in Fima" (p. 124). The valley: There is scarcely a mention of valleys before the dream, which amplifies their peculiar importance in the dream. In the first of the two mentions, moreover, the valleys are not a geomorphic figure but an anthropomorphic one: Fima awakens from a dream in the morning, after his conversation with Zvi, "at the touch of a warm and heavy hand. He opened his eyes and saw the back of his father's brown hand, crouched like a turtle on his thigh, an ancient hand, broad, with flattened, yellowing nails, covered in valleys and hills, carved out in blue-grey blood vessels, dotted with liver spots among the thinning hairs. He was dumbfounded for a moment, then realized it was his own hand" (p. 14-15). Fima has come to identify his father as a natural force of great size and strength, a chthonic deity, a Titan, perhaps the equal of the earth. The stage upon which Fima plays out his life is his father's body. He is precisely in his father's hand. This is the landscape of his life, supplanted for a brief instant, in Greece, by a single other valley before the dream: In Greece with the three girls, after a short, hard rain, "the air cleared. It was possible to make out, from a great distance, the movement of the shadows of the pines as they lay on the red tile roofs of the little villages in the valleys . . . every single needle stood out on the sides of the distant hills." Fima notes, out of context, that "this is where the secret lies hidden" (p. 22). The secret, the meaning of an independent life, lies in these valleys, these clefts, these girls. The enemy army moves through them in all its unstoppable potency in the dream. His father makes his first appearance in person in the chapter immediately following the dream: Listening to his father's humming as he approaches, Fima wonders whether he hums in his sleep too, "as if his body were too small to restrain the tune. Or as if age itself had cut little cracks in him through</page><page sequence="11">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 11 which the tunes dripped" (p. 60). The image is again of his father as a valleyed landscape, but this earth has begun to splinter, has become prey to subterranean magmic forces, now a hum, now something more sinister. On his way home from Yael's Fima ponders his father's difficulties in breathing. He notes 44 his exhalation, his coughing, and the whistle which perhaps breaks forth (the Hebrew root is the same as that for valley, bq*) from his throat or from the depths of his chest" (p. 123). In the dream Fima runs out of breath.11 It is actually Barukh Nürn- berg who has difficulty breathing throughout the novel. Though we hear nothing of this before the dream, immediately after the dream we hear of it in profusion. The anoxia (Barukh's) is complemented by an accompany- ing miasma, and the gasping and odors stifle Fima. On pages 60 and 146 Fima catches his father's scent (the odors of the typically rich, bourgeois, traditional Ashkenazic diet) and then notices his puffs and whistles. On pages 63 and 64 Fima identifies these sounds with his father's effort to suppress Fima's speech. Fima longs to stop his father's talking but instead chokes off his own enraged response. Just before Barukh leaves, their argument ends. He brings up the question of those who will come after them and how those future residents will recall them. "'The snows of yesteryear. A handful of dust blowing in the wind. Nor is there enough air to breathe here at your place. The air itself is a little asphyxiating here'" (p. 66). Fima's father is dying; he can't catch a breath. Fima is stifling in his father's exhalation; and the suffocating air exudes from the ground of reality itself, as we see. In an encounter with a God he imagines as an old Jerusalemite Sefardic merchant, Fima asks the question: "Is it really all 'a vanity of vanities?'" Of course, the Hebrew of this citation from Ecclesiastes reads, "the merest puff of hot air." He gets only this response: "The old man let out a sort of sour burp of tobacco and arak" (p. 73). Yet Fima continues his hopeless pursuit. In a dream about his mother Fima pursues her, calls out to her, "In spite of his running, the way a fat boy runs, breathless, and in spite of his calling out to her ... he failed to shorten the distance between them" (p. 94). At the end of this dream, his mother, pierced by wire barbs, turns to him and says, "'Just look at what they've done to you, golem' " and removes her dark glasses. At this, Fima turns away in terror and awakens. The air of the city and its surroundings clears "Difficulties with breathing have played their part, by the way, in Oz's decision to move down to Arad.</page><page sequence="12">12 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 for the first time. The fog and dimness have disappeared and everything in view is within his reach (p. 95). There was no mention of breathlessness before the dream, so that we cannot quite grasp what the image does in the dream itself. It seems reasonable to assert that the novel acts as an icon: it suppresses our knowledge of Fima's father's forthcoming expiration iconically as Fima suppresses the knowledge from himself. Fima while awake deludes himself. This point may serve to begin a consideration of Fima's confusion and that of the figure in the dream. I would like to restate three of Freud's principles for deciphering how the dream-censor encodes what it graciously reveals. The three principles which I will just mention here- the use of images, words, and occurrences from the previous day usually, the contraction of these into figures, and the immobilized figure- are most useful in analyzing the man/boy figure of the dream. Freud says that only one logical relationship is favored in the dreams we construct to tell ourselves what we would like to hear and what we fear to listen to. That logical relationship is similarity, congru ity, agreement, "just as."12 He writes that this relationship is quite generally expressed in dreams by contraction into a unity, one thing identified as another or more than one thing combined to express a commonality. The common property, when the ego of the dreamer appears in the dream, may be wished and may be realized in the dream while the dreamer stands concealed as another strange person. Before showing how this syndrome constructs the figure of the boy/man from a common property and is reflected in the imagery, I will mention another of Freud's findings: "that the inability to do something in a dream is the expression of a contradic- tion, a 'No'; . . . that the sensation of inhibited movement expresses a will to which a counter-will is opposed and the sensation represents a conflict of will." 13 The secrets of Fima's dream are concentrated in the figure of the boy beating the man with egrofim razim. The use of the phrase " be-egrofim razim " in the title of the chapter translates equally as "with skinny fists" 12 Interpretation , p. 319ff. 13 Interpretation , p. 337.</page><page sequence="13">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 13 (which is its use in the context of the dream itself)14 and "there are mysteries in fists. " Both possibilities refer to the fists of the boy in the figure. Together they remind one of the saying (the consonants rmz occur in both parts of the proverb), le-hakima birmiza; le-shatya be-kurmiza: "A hint's enough for a sage; a fool requires a fist" ( Midr . mishle , 22). The boy in the dream is very likely one of the enraged shebaab of the Intifada, built out of the one mentioned in an earlier news report. In the third chapter, we read: He heard on the twelve o'clock news that "an Arab youth was wounded and killed this morning by a plastic bullet which was fired apparently from the rifle of a soldier at the Jabaliyya refugee camp" . . . F i ma thought about the text of the announcement. He was particularly disgusted by the expression "was killed by a plastic bullet." And he was enraged by the word "apparently." Finally he was angered in a more inclusive way about the use of the nifal [passive verb form] which was gradually taking over the language of official announcements and perhaps the whole language. And even though it was possible that a feeling of shame, healthy and benign shame, is what prevents us from announcing simply: A Jewish soldier shot and killed an Arab boy, on the other hand, does not this filthy language instruct us that the rifle is guilty, the causes which are being investigated are guilty, the plastic bullet is guilty, as if the whole filthy matter was to be blamed on Heaven, as if everything was decreed, (p. 17) But in the dream the boy is stripped of identity as an Arab. In general terms, then, the dreamboy is a young male figure attached to an older man. As such he participates in the confusion of generations which informs the lives of Fima, his father Barukh, and Dimi, the son of Yael, Fima's former wife, by her current spouse. The child, cared for by both Fima and Barukh, calls them both saba , "grandpa" (pp. 27, 162). Both Fima and his father set money and possessions aside for Dimi and each treats him as his heir. Fima confuses himself with Dimi. He feels what Dimi feels. He is, for example, unsure of whether it is he or Dimi who is sick (p. 131). It would 14The chapters all have titles. (The chapters of Sumkbi have brief summaries preceding them.) Oryan (n. 1) finds the usage archaic while remarking that its employment in novels (from Don Quixote to Fielding and Dickens!) is a cheap game between the author and the narrator since the first knows what the second should reveal in order to heighten tension or humor or surprise. She thinks it particularly unfit for this novel and even proposes that Oz has come to it in order to please critics who find him humorless. I disagree and find it a source of wonder as the reader ponders his own part in the trinity of author, narrator, and reader. This chapter title is a good example of what I mean. The secret s are hidden from Fima's consciousness in one way and hidden from the reader in a different way.</page><page sequence="14">14 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 seem that Fima is blocked from reproducing himself in a child. He is a bystander in the clinic where he works, for example. His affairs are with married women. His father has replaced Fima's mother in his life, and denies him any other feminine presence after she dies. The power his father possesses reduces Fima to sterility. From outside, Yael too identifies Fima with his father, "only lacking [his old-world airs]" (p. 136). Fima's bride is in fact Barukh's kallahy selected by him for his son. The figure of the dreamer with the boy on his shoulders embodies monstrous, many- armed despair. In the dream, Fima and the boy on his shoulders have their silent, hopeless, desperate struggle in common. Neither can speak. Fima's inability to speak arises from some conflict of wills as mentioned. The boy's inability is converted to an effective communication: his fists, and his knees choke off Fima's speech and his very breath. Fima identifies himself with the boy in their speechlessness. The problem is at once one of politics- Fima is a pragmatic leftist15- and the oedipal struggle, for if Fima is identical with the boy, the older figure carrying the boy must be Barukh. If this is a father bearing his boy on his shoulders, the relationship is, however, not one of affection but of war at the closest quarters. If we are led back to the Old Man of the Sea aboard Sinbad by the image, we get an inversion of the ages of the two parts: older riding younger, a perception which contributes to the common idea of the figure, that of generational displacement, strife, and the dreamer's anguish. All this participates in the dream's rich image. For Fima the power of language as both signified by and signifying his difficulties and their solutions expresses the sum of his discontent. Fima's struggle with language - the language other people use which conceals motives and facts, as well as his own "empty phrasings" - is the most conspicuous of his struggles with his world. Most of his life is spent in words, as a writer and reader, proponent and critic of ideas whose trails he finds in verbal behavior. The novel begins with his fury over one such gesture, in the news report. His relationships are bound up by words. When Fima's wife writes him from Seattle, saying that she's leaving him, "Fima smiled to himself while reading the trite phrase 'another man in my life'" (p. 25). Fima fears and distrusts words, particularly as they speak emotions: "If it were possible to express love in words, this would be evidence that the love had ceased" (p. 26). The earliest expression of Fima's concern occurs in his youth when he longs to catch his elders 15A s is Oz. See, for example, the interview in the New York Times of October 29, 1991 on the eve of the Madrid conference.</page><page sequence="15">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 15 misspeaking and to overcome them in arguments. He sought "to force the adults to raise the white flag." For instance, one of the guests would use the expression rov rubo shel ha'am , at which Fima, the prodigy, calmly points out that the phrase does not mean "'the vast majority of the people' but only 25.1%" (p. 123). Yael writes him that as time passes "you have become a prattler, Effi. You even stand there arguing with the radio. Correcting their Hebrew for the newscasters" (p. 135). From all accounts, Fima's identity is trapped in his obsession with language. The phones don't work for him. He doesn't any longer know who he's trying to reach (himself) or why. He despairs of his attempts to right things. When Zvi attempts to stir Fima's hopes by showing him evidence of the interest critics continue to display in his work, Fima replies, "'That's enough, Zvike. Leave it be.' His prophecies, like his poems, seemed faraway to Fima and out of touch with what was essential: What was it the soul longed for, never knowing why? What was real and what only seemed to be? Where could one search for that which is lost and forgotten?" (p. 72). Remarkably perceptive, Yael asks, "Why does it seem to you that if you stop talking for a few moments you will stop existing" (p. 16). In the present moment, he finds great political significance in the pronouns chosen by Gunther Grass as opposed to those used by Israelis. He quotes Grass as having referred to the Nazis as "them." "While you and I [Zvi], all these years, when we write about the conquest, about corrup- tion, about oppression in the territories, even about the war in Lebanon, even about the actions of the settlers, always use, without exception, the word 'we'?" He continues on the next page in the same discussion to assert that the responsibility of the Israeli people to their language is unbounded (p. 142f). He stresses the causative effect of words on acts when he says that, "Wherever we turn, we leave in our wake the corpses of words from which the path to corpses of Arab children murdered daily in the territories is a short one" (p. 163). Ultimately, his desires for an accurate language are entirely frustrated. "But the expression 'bloodbath' seemed to him a wornout cliche. And even the concept 'wornout cliche' tasted hackneyed to him at that moment" (p. 206; and cf. pp. 29, 30, 40, 44, 46, 97, etc.). The bad object in his war for words is his oldest antagonist, his father. Over time the focus of Fima's struggle for his own identity against Barukh has become political argument. "If [he could only overcome his father in political dispute] then the barrier to peace and a new reality would be removed" (p. 123). Thus we find that Fima's obsession with language gives voice to his self-doubts, his emotional ambivalence and his political positions. In the dream, the entirety of Fima's expressed concern is lodged in his need to</page><page sequence="16">16 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 find appropriate language, to carry out his duty and halt the advance of the armored enemy, whoever that may be. (Recall that the enemy is not identified and does speak Hebrew, presumably.) In the dream Fima's inability and his shame are confirmed and brought to an inescapable end by his shortness of breath and then by his strangulation. In the image of Fima's breath running out and then of his strangulation we find the source of his difficulty in the dream and his distorted wish. The two parts of the single man/boy figure have strangulation in common: the one strangling, the other being strangled. In its murderous intent the figure joins Fima with the boy twice-slain: first by the soldiers and then by the news report. As it brings together an older and younger male, we are led to consider Fima's relationship with the only older male of the novel, his father Barukh. While it is true that Fima is earning his own small living, the apartment in which he lives has been given to him by his father as a wedding gift. In exchange, his father has demanded that Fima regularize his life and conform to his father's standards of conduct and purpose. Fima fails to do so; moreover, his childless marriage fails as well. His father continues to support Fima's life in the apartment and, as the novel opens, makes arrangements for the whitewashing of the apartment itself. Barukh Nomberg is a stock figure from the pre-war, central European, Jewish, intellectual bourgeoisie. He has been through this century's promises and betrayals of the Jews. His manners are of that time and place and his self-centered politics derive from the most tragic experience of powerlessness. Fima cannot deny this experience. Barukh's language brings all this together and points it at Fima. His politics carry his privilege and are spoken in tones of deep irony. They are abhorrent to Fima. The facts which motivate Barukh's philosophy are beyond Fima's personal experience, and yet they are undeniable facts of history. Wherever Fima's reasonings come in touch with them they render him helpless and impotent. Certainly, Efraim, certainly. None would dispute the purity of your intentions. The sad thing is that you're only fooling yourselves: your Arabs are only politely seeking, as it were, the return of Shechem and Hebron. Then they'll go home happy and merry and there'll be peace upon Israel and Ishmael. But that is not what they want from us. Jerusalem, they want, Fimuchka, Jaffa and Haifa. Ramallah. To slaughter us a little, that's all they want. To annihilate us. If you'd only take the trouble to listen a little bit to what they say to each other. The sad thing is, that you only hear yourselves talking, again and again. . . . The Cossacks, his father noted with an air of amused indifference. Nu? And if so, what? What harm is there in being, at last, Cossacks, once. Just for a change. Where is it written in the Torah that</page><page sequence="17">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 17 Jew and goy are forbidden a little change of roles? Once every thousand years or so? If only you, my dear, were yourself a bit more of a Cossack and not such a shlemazel. Your boy is like you too: a lamb in lamb's clothing, (pp. 64-65) Although Barukh's acts are generous to others as well as to Fima, Fima hates him for his benevolence and for his success and for the power he holds over him and his past and over the state and its present. He notes that "he lives out of his father's hand" (p. 92). Fima becomes aware of new difficulties in Barukh's respiration as Barukh appears. He is concerned and he does nothing. If a single incident in the novel can be the source of this part of Fima's oedipal struggle, an encounter between Fima as a child, his father and another man in Talbiyeh is my candidate. Fima, a child, angers his father while they are walking together through Talbiyeh one morning. His father has stopped to carry on a conversation with a fellow inhabitant, a landsman who has achieved world fame in his scholarly pursuits. Fima tugs at his father's coat to go on and Barukh turns to him with a slap and a rebuke, delivered in a slavic roar: "You punk! You little fool!" [Ty durah f Ty smarkacf] (p. 246). Fima's language is not his father's. His father has a power language, one in which secrets are kept and sentences are passed: the language of the dead diaspora society and unquestionable authority.16 Fima will not be free until Barukh's language falls silent. In fact when Barukh does die, Fima is set free, however temporarily: the air which chokes Fima in the dream is the air of the apartment in which his Father lives and whose windows Fima throws open. He closes them immediately, in dread of his role and hating himself for seeking and finding the death of his oppressor, the murderer of his own father. Before he has learned of his father's death, Fima has come to the decision that that very day, "He would not relent, he would not weaken, he would not compromise, he would stand his ground till the end and remove Barukh's fingers from his pocket and from his life once and for all" (p. 236). One recalls the valleys of the father/son hand (above, p. 10) and Fima's recogni- tion that he lives out of his father's hand. After he learns of his father's death, "he was surprised at the new capacity which the disaster had brought him. As if the death of his father had gained him a promotion, elevated him astonishingly in rank so that hereafter he was enabled to give out orders at his pleasure and to gain immediate obedience" (p. 244). Yet, l6It is worth noting that two major reviews of the novel (Hirsch's and Oryan's) describe Fima as a nudnik , another word from Polish (¡ nudzic , to bore someone).</page><page sequence="18">18 SHOFAR Spring 1995 Vol. 13, No. 3 seated in his father's chair, master of his father's abode, owner of his father's enterprise, the perfume factory, Fima "is forced to throttle the tears of his longing. Not longing for the dead, not for what was here and is no longer, but for what might have been here and was not and now would never be. In his thoughts, the words, 'his maker would not know him' arose" (p. 248). The impossible creature of the dream, one, Fima-the child, chokes the other, adult-Fima, and punishes him for his wish to kill his father. The wish is the secret, the force within the childish fists. His father's ironic language with its historical reference to a murdered world is the Tateloshn. Barukh's use of quotations from rabbinic literature draws on even more than ancient authority. The warm language of the diaspora in Fima's history was Yiddish, the Mameloshn. Fima's mother is long dead, though she reappears ambiguously, terriiyingly, in his dreams. The other language, the language of men in the diaspora, the Tateloshn , was Hebrew, of a particular high variety, secret from the child in his mother's embrace. The Tateloshn is privileged speech, overwhelmingly potent, and in his father's variety contains deep within itself and far, far beyond Fima's grasp of the Tateloshn , a slavic component. In fact, the father and his language are not only secret, they are unreachable, uncompromising, incommunicative, dead. The father's language has become Lacan's nom-du-père , signifying "the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified the person of the father with the figure of the law."17 In the dream, Fima strangles both his father and himself. Fima's father's language has regressed him. He has become childish, associates with children and women by permission of their husbands. He has lost the power of his own language and is in a state of narcissistic rage. The language of the dead (Father) continues to dominate him, more so than when Barukh was alive and some response however futile could be given. Fima strangles his father to bring his father's language to a close and free his own. To expiate his guilt, he strangles himself no less in his life than in the dream. He fears an annihilation which proceeds through his own dependence on his father, like the one he saw his mother suffer. He wishes to be free of his father and sees his father's death as liberating; his father's language must die; his politics will then die and Fima's youth will be set free. The battle is to the death. Fima is in a constant state of regression, seeking release from the Tateloshn in order to regain the language of his own lost childhood. When Yael asks him whether he does not talk himself into existence, Fima falls 17Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (New York, 1977), p. 67.</page><page sequence="19">A Dream and a Delusion in Oz's Hamatzav Hashlishi 19 "silent as a child whose mother has rebuked him" (p. 16). On this quest for his lost past, the place where his power lies buried, he must contend with the guilt he feels in the murder of his father and the burial of his father's politics. The conflict sets the goal beyond his reach. If we come to understand Fima as an impotent adult and his father as the object Fima determines to have caused this; and if we come to the view that something of Israel's youth and hope, as Fima represents it, has been stifled by its aging leadership, as his father represents that, we do so because Oz has plotted our path by writing a novel in which state politics are modeled on the psychology of the individual. The regressive hero, Fima, is frozen in childishness by the unchecked power of his male parent, and the state is held captive by its own past, dreaming hopelessly away in a present where real power is possessed by the dead and dying. Dreams are central to Oz's strategy in the novel. They prove to be prophetic in the way that only dreams in novels can be, each detail fraught with meaning compressed into twisted and compacted revelations. These are Freudian dreams; the novel is a Freudian novel. Lest we conclude that we have the views of Oz himself on the political situation of Israel (the stasis to which Fima is condemned), or think that Oz is considering his own history, we do well to recall that Freud abandoned his application of dream interpreta- tion to the novel at a very early stage. Since the theory was so well applied to Gradiva , Freud must have abandoned the practice because it worked too well in the world of the work of art and he wished to work on a broader field, where the absence of certain data could lead to interpreta- tions that would be, if less conclusive, more life-like. One concludes that in just this way the Oz novel is not very life-like and one ought to say that it represents neither Oz's biography nor his politics in its near-perfect closedness. Yet we may be terrified by the truths the novel owns as we encounter entries from Freud's own grimoire.</page></plain_text>
