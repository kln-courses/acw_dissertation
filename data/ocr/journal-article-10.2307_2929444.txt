MAHLENDORF Where the Air Throbs "A young man must get to know the world, Mr. Humor had been told; he was ready to travel at a moment's notice, and, because Paris had been praised above all other places in the world, he was there, before he really knew what was worth seeing."* Just like the hero of his first unfinished novel, The Travels of Young Humor, Ernst Bar- lach, Expressionist sculptor, playwright, and novelist had drifted to the French capital in 1895 to study art and to receive "the kind of polish only Paris could give." The twenty-six year old art student followed a trend of the times, for from the turn of the century till the outbreak of the First World War German artists and writers, Neo-Romanticists, Neo-Classicists, Impressionists and Expressionists alike, flocked to Paris. Those authors who had established reputa- tions met Parisians of renown (Rilke, Rodin and Andre Gide; Hof- mannsthal, Maeterlinck and Cezanne; Stefan George, the Symbol- ists), while the Expressionists, mostly younger men hoping to make a name for themselves (Schickele, Edschmid, Rubiner, Zech, Franz Marc, Pechstein, Meidner, Feininger) studied at academies, fre- quented night-clubs, and joined forces with the Fauves. Being students, they had no money. That they could not pay their landladies did not concern them; a member of this group, Max Pechstein, notes in his Erinnerungen: "For months I found excuses not to pay the rent, and this, according to Parisian artists, was the thing to do; the whole problem was only a question of moving, . . . you took your stove, bed, straw chairs, easel, suitcase, drawings, and paints; friends stood guard so that you were not surprised by the concierge. Your possessions were put on a cart. You moved to an- other neighborhood." They knew the loneliness of the stranger and the fear of the city that Rilke describes so hauntingly in The Note- books of Malte Laurids Brigge. At night, faces and scenes from the day press in on Malte and fill his desolate room with their terrifying presence: the epileptic fighting an attack, the sick waiting at the Salpetriere, the poor seeking warmth in the Louvre. Barlach's hero also knows these nights of fear and abandonment. For some offense, the nature of which he cannot guess, he spends a night imprisoned in * All translations from the German are mine unless noted otherwise.

Assailed by doubts concerning his talent, Young Humor sits next to Michel- angelo's slaves. Suddenly, a ghost approaches, a former official of the Louvre, now resident in the Pere-La-Chaise Cemetery, and night watchman during his heures perdues. He invites Young Humor to accompany him on his rounds. As they pass through the galleries, the hero sees many empty frames whose occupants have left for a visit to neighboring canvases and receives many angry glances from volup- tuous beauties whom he surprises in the arms of their lovers. While the ghost explains that such social calls are forbidden, the visitors enter a gallery where all frames are empty, their subjects having left for a party on the roof. Young Humor and the ghost follow them in- to the rain and see strange scenes: Baroque ladies worrying about their damp crinolines, naked young gods trying to keep warm by smoking Dutch pipes. It is not until dawn that the phantoms return to their proper frames, order is re-established, and Young Humor leaves his new friends with regret. What might have been a night of anguish becomes for Barlach a revel of laughter. In Malte Laurids Brigge Rilke portrays only one aspect of Paris. The letters to his wife attribute to the city "the generosity of a born landscape;" it is a townscape viewed in the manner of Cezanne: A massive east wind, coming over the city with deployed front, since it finds it so capacious. To the west, buffeted . . . archi- pelagoes of clouds, . . . grey like the neck-feathers . . . of water-birds in an ocean of cold, imperceptible blueness, re- motely serene. And beneath all this, dwarfed by it, the Place de la Concorde, and the shady trees of the Champs-Elysees, black simplified to green, . . . To the right, houses . . . in the background, in the dove-grey haze, more houses, clamped into planes, with rectilinear, quarry-like surfaces. And sud- denly, as you approach the Obelisk . . . there the marvelous avenue flows toward you in a scarcely perceptible gradient, rich and rapid as a river which, ages ago, with its own vio- lence had washed the red into the rocky walls of the Arc de Triomphe down by the Etoile (Selected Letters, p. 154). One notes the depth of the Cezannes landscape, its structure, its organization. Like Cezanne, but not as forcefully, Rilke creates depth by the juxtaposition of cool colors and warm colors. Moreover, he refers to history in order to achieve a temporal perspective, intensify- ing spatial depth through historical depth. This juxtaposition is not entirely successful in that his allusions are marred by inaccuracies. Rilke also seeks to evoke Cezanne's composition by the use of such attributes as "rectilinear, quarry-like" and even copies the painter's 139</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies tilted perspective. The strength of Cezanne's colors, however, is lack- ing and the Rilkean greys and the undulating "buffeted clouds" ob- scure the conscious imitation of the French painter. The Expressionist envisages Paris quite differently. His evocation of the city glows with color, echoes with noise, vibrates with agitation. Where Rilke, radiant and serene, stands aloof, Barlach rushes onto the scene and transforms it into a fantasy: On a pleasure flight toward nightfall Young Humor happened to alight on the Place de la Concorde. A number of noble ladies, fashioned of stone, were sitting around in a spacious circle. The youngest, called the City of Strasbourg, seemed to be the favorite daughter of the Place de la Concorde; the other sisters accused her of . . . arrogance, for she was deco- rated splendidly, covered from head to toe with wreaths and tricolored ornaments. . . . With poisonous glances they had woven a dangerous net over the scene, and in this web squirmed the feelings . . of the youngest sister. . . Some wriggled out of their clothes to fly away stark naked; . . . they were ashamed, for . . . most of them had worn dresses much too large for them; skinny and bony. they cut a sorry figure. For Rilke the purpose of man is to tell of things and to praise them; for Barlach the inanimate world is significant only in so far as it con- cerns man. He endows statues with emotions and then gives them concrete shape in order to expose human folly. His anthropomorphic vision, however, is neither romantic nor moralistic. He does not in- dulge in sentimental sympathy with objects, but allows his imagination to roam. He plays on words, establishes relationships between un- related concepts, and explores the literal meaning of figurative ex- pressions. The cliche nackte Geffihle (naked, raw emotions) acquires satirical pungency when these emotions are visualized in the shape of winged emaciated women. Barlach's viewpoint is not fixed. He ridicules emotionalism and idealism and pokes fun at German snob- bism and French patriotism. For example, the president of the Club of German Ideas, Mr. Belief-in-Authority, asks Young Humor to the club's meeting place, the Arc de Triomphe: "They flew to the top while the humming and bustling of equipages . . . flowed around the proud form of the Arch like a bulging robe." Its massive style as well as the more suggestive connotations of its name make this structure a splendid clubhouse for German ideas. But the city does not seem so gay and carefree to all Expressionists. It would be impossible to imagine such an important Expressionist magazine as the Aktion without its poems and essays on Parisian life 140</page><page sequence="4">URSULA R. MAHLENDORF and without its translations from Baudelaire, Apollinaire, and La- forgue. This interest has often been overlooked by those critics who regard Expressionism as an exclusively German phenomenon. Reject- ing much of their native literary heritage, Expressionists like Heym, Zech, and Stadler, to name but a few, schooled themselves in the poetry of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Apollinaire, and Laforgue, and adopted their motifs as well as their imagery to evoke cities that could be any European metropolis. Expressionists, on the whole, did not agree with Rilke who wrote "that Paris itself is a task, a very great task that almost consumes one" (see Baudelaire's "Le Crepuscule du Matin"). Rather they envisaged Paris as a crucible in which they wished to be immersed and transformed. Their portrayals of the city in verse and prose are characterized by vitality, elan, and aggressive freshness exemplified by Friedrich Eisenlohr's poem "Les Halles" which establishes a series of brutal contrasts: On a butcher's table stream gory rivers . . . Staggering drunks wade through the mire, accompanied by graceful dancers in red. Stout fishwives cry their wares. A child begs. Legendary gardens. Conflagration of flowers, enticing, swaying, and a fragrance, deep like dreams. The Expressionist's youthful enthusiasm for vital and striking op- posites rarely permits the creation of a convincing and esthetically satisfying work of art; indeed, for the most part, their poems about Paris are too lurid and too trite. An exception is Georg Heym, whose novella The Fifth of October (1911) celebrates Paris as the city of the Revolution and the fifth of October as the advent of a new age. Heym evokes the thoughts of the people as they stand in the streets and wait for bread from Provence: Never did the sun shine into their graves. What did the sun know of their squalid holes? Sometimes, at noon, they saw it hover over the city, etherized by its yellow smoke, . . . then it would disappear. The shadows emerged from beneath the houses and crept along their walls, black polyps of the allays. How often had they not stood by the Luxembourg and looked . . . at the spacious, sunny meadows. They had stared at the dances of the ladies-in-waiting, the thyrsi of the courtiers in costumes embroidered with gold, . . . at the trays with oranges, . . . at the golden state coach in which the queen rode slowly through the park like a Syrian goddess, a huge Astarte, bristling with white silk and shimmering like a saint surrounded by pearls. 141</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies The tension created by the many contrasts between squalor and splendor, colloquialisms and formalisms, terse phrases and long flow- ing sentences terminates in and is resolved by a violent revolutionary incident. Moreover, the people, ennobled by their suffering, have become what the Expressionists called "new men," and their city, Paris, a political and revolutionary ideal. This ideal city was, for Heym as well as for his contemporaries, a political city. Citizens of a country that had never known a real revolution, subjects of a bureaucratic monarchy that stifled their desire for participation in political action, many Expressionists looked to Paris "where the very air throbs with feverish political activity." Georg Heym's poem "Yearning for Paris" expresses their admiration for the city's revolutionary past, a past which they projected onto the present: "At any dawn, a blood-red sun bums on the Seine in a sea of houses, . . . a sun like a flaming beacon, like a huge grail filled to the brim with the red wine of liberty." Such fervor did not always remain theoretical. In his novel The Stranger (1910), pub- lished as a serial in the Aktion, Rene Schickele portrays a hero who comes to Paris as a dreamer and leaves it as a political activist intent upon creating a democratic united Europe. Much like Heine in his journalistic pieces for the Augsburger Zeitung, Schickele, the Paris correspondent of an Alsatian paper, attempted to mediate between France and Germany. He followed the example of Heine who had published his correspondence under the title of Lutezia (1854), by re-editing his vivacious accounts of Parisian elections, strikes, and scandals under the title of Shouts on the Boulevard (1912). Yet Schickele lacks the keen insight into political psychology that enabled Heine to prophecy naziism as well as communism. The outbreak of the First World War crushed the political hope of the Expressionists. Some of them fled to Switzerland (Schickele, Rubiner), others spent some war years in prison or work-camps (Otten, Toller), others died on the Schlacht-feldern Europas.* In protest against the Zeitgeist, the A ktion printed more translations of, and essays on, French authors. As the war went on, Expressionist opposition increased. Its leaders worked for peace and, at the end of the war, many joined the ranks of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils. Being intellectuals, they were shocked by the violence of their "proletarian brothers," but it was the failure of the revolution of 1918 that brought complete disillusionment. Their dream of uni- versal brotherhood had been shattered. Yet, the Expressionist vision of Paris was to come to life once * An Expressionist pun. The word means "battlefield," but can also be read as "slaughter-field" (schlachten-slaughter). 142</page><page sequence="6">URSULA R. MAHLENDORF more in the canvases of Oskar Kokoschka during the early twenties. One of these paintings evokes the fagade of the Opera, metamor- phosed into a fagade of fire. For Kokoschka they are flames of life, for Yvon Goll they are flames of destruction. In his poem "Eiffel- tower" (1924), which contains Expressionist and Surrealist elements, Goll describes the death of an age of idealism and the beginning of a new commercial era. Old ideals are discounted in a city where "waiters . . . sell love of mankind." Paris burns while the poets, who, for the Expressionists, had been the conscience of mankind, now celebrate the victory of materialism. Grief and irony blend in this last Expressionist evocation of the city: Paris Diamond pendant on Europe's necklace Jazz bands play of the Arc de Triomphe The Eiffeltower sings softly in the wind Monsieur Eiffel, magician in sport clothes Has invited all poets of Europe to a last supper On the first platform of his tower A symphony of clouds And after the third course: stars broiled by lightning Recitations Poetry contests that last all night Monsieur Eiffel gives everyone three shares of his company Maecenas, Prometheus But Paris continues burning....
