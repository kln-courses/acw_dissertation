Ricci University of Michigan T ransportation Research Institute Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The factors that influence airbag-induced upper- extremity injuries sustained by drivers were investigated in this study. Seven unembalmed human cadavers were used in nineteen direct-forearm-interaction static deployments. A single horizontal-tear-seam airbag module and two different inflators were used. Spacing between the instrumented forearm and the airbag module was varied from 10 cm to direct contact in some tests. Forearm-bone instrumentation included triaxial accelerometry, crack detection gages, and film targets. Internal airbag pressure was also measured. The observed injuries were largely transverse, oblique, and wedge fractures of the ulna or radius, or both, similar to those reported in field investigations. Tears of the elbow joint capsule were also found, both with and without fracture of the forearm. Forearm fracture occurrence was analyzed with respect to time of airbag deployment, distal forearm speed, airbag-module-to-forearm spacing, bone mineral content, and upper-extremity mass. Forearm fractures occurred within 5 to 10 ms of the onset of airbag pressure, as indicated by crack detection gage output. Time of fracture was found to coincide with local reductions in resultant distal forearm acceleration, and local plateaus of distal forearm speed. Peak distal forearm speed ranged from 9 to 21 m/s, and decreased approximately 30 percent when initial airbag-module-to- forearm spacing was increased from direct contact to 2.5 cm. A distinct division between fracture and nonfracture cases was found at about 15.2 m/s peak, and 11.7 m/s average, distal forearm speed. Distal forearm speed, fracture incidence, and fracture severity were typically reduced as initial airbag-module-to-forearm spacing was increased. Additionally, under direct-contact conditions, fractures occurred in bones having mineral contents less than 1.03 g/cm, but not in bones having greater mineral contents. Both distal forearm speed and mineral content were found to be strongly related to the mass of the upper extremity. Therefore, the potential for forearm fracture was also found to be strongly related to the mass of the upper extremity. The results of this study suggest that airbag-module- to-forearm spacing has a substantial influence on airbag- induced upper-extremity injuries sustained by drivers. Increased initial spacing between the airbag module and the forearm reduces the incidence and severity of forearm fractures caused by direct interaction with the airbag. Furthermore, increased initial spacing reduces the speeds ultimately achieved by the distal forearm, thereby potentially mitigating flailing injuries. The results also suggest that a simple airbag aggressivity- assessment tool for the prediction of forearm fracture might be based upon peak or average distal forearm speed of a biof√¨delic, surrogate arm. INTRODUCTION A variety of injuries to the upper extremities have been reported as a result of airbag deployments in automotive crashes. Superficial skin trauma such as erythema, contusion, abrasion, or burn caused by contact with the airbag fabric, module cover, or exhaust gases have been observed most frequently. Reed et al. (1992) have characterized abrasion injury resulting from contact with a deploying airbag, while the potential for burn from airbag exhaust gases has been quantified by Reed et al. (1994). Huelke et al. (1995) have described cases of vehicular crashes involving more serious airbag-induced injuries including fractures, dislocations, and lacerations of the forearm, wrist, and hand. These injuries have been attributed to direct contact with the airbag and module door, entrapment between the airbag and steering rim, or flailing of the limb into other parts of the automotive interior, the occupant, or other occupants. 3663</page><page sequence="2">Basic injury-tolerance data for the human forearm are sparse, and dynamic, transverse-loading data are not readily available. Much of the data that are available pertain to static three-point bending tests of isolated bones. Early investigations by Weber (1856) and Messerer (1880), as reviewed by Melvin and Evans (1985), provide differing results. The more recent work of Motoshima (1965), as referenced by Yamada (1970), provides additional insight regarding the fracture tolerance of isolated forearm bones of human cadavers tested in anteroposterior, three-point bending. These studies were used by Saul et al. (1996) to estimate dynamic, forearm fracture-tolerance to bending moment, as an aid in the design and use of an instumented Hybrid III arm for assessment of airbag- induced forearm fractures. The available moment- tolerance data were collected from the literature, and radius and ulna tolerances were assumed to be additive. Additional moment-tolerance levels were calculated using failure loads and forearm-support distances from data sets in which moments were not measured directly. After scaling the data from static to dynamic conditions using a factor of 1.5, moment-tolerance ranges of 120 to 150 N-m and 70 to 90 N-m were suggested for male and female forearms, respectively, for application to direct- loading airbag-induced fractures. Scaling from fixed to free impact conditions was not addressed, nor was the appropriateness of applying an energy-based scaling factor to moment data. The resulting arm was used in two positions with three airbag systems in six static deployments, to examine forearm bending moment, acceleration, and wrist velocity. The efficacy of applying midsized-male anthropometry to the assessment of forearm injury was not discussed. However, it was assumed that fracture potential could be assessed by measuring bending moments. The need for dynamic biomechanical data was also stressed. Kuppa et al. (1997) introduced the Research Arm Injury Device, or RAID, which was used to examine airbag aggressivity. The authors described the RAID as a 0.5 kg mass (hand), coupled to a 1.6 kg aluminum tube (forearm), attached to a double-pivot joint (elbow). Five strain-gage arrays facilitated measurement of bending moments at various points along the length of the tube, and a block mounted at the midlength point provided triaxial-acceleration data. Bending moments, accelerations, and "hand" speeds were evaluated in static deployment tests. These tests used driver airbags that were judged as more and less injurious from accident-investigation data, inflator tank tests, and module characteristics. Thirty-four static deployments were conducted using four different airbags with the RAID positioned in one of three orientations to the airbag tear seam, at one of three distances from the airbag. Peak moment, acceleration and hand speed were found to decrease as the initial distance between the RAID and airbag module increased. The RAID was deemed capable of separating aggressive and nonaggressive airbags in these tests, and relative RAID-airbag positioning was cited as a critical factor. Additionally, the authors used techniques similar to those of Saul et al. (1996) to suggest a dynamic-forearm-fracture tolerance of 90 N-m for females. The moments measured by the RAID ranged from 100 to 650 N-m, exceeding the postulated threshold for fracture of female forearms in every test. However, this study did not demonstrate the biomechanical relationship between the test conditions and fracture of human forearms, because of the physical differences between the RAID and the human arm, and because of the limitations and assumptions associated with the fracture-tolerance-estimate technique. Johnston et al. (1997) compared the performance of the RAID introduced by Kuppa et al. (1997) with the performance of the instrumented-dummy arm designed by Saul et al. (1996). Four airbag systems were evaluated using each device in four different configurations. It was found that both the RAID and the instrumented Hybrid III ranked the airbag systems similarly according to relative aggressivity, but that the kinematics associated with each device were dramatically different. Therefore, the accelerations, moments, and speeds measured by each device under similar test conditions were different. It was stated that the RAID could characterize direct interactions with airbags, but unlike the instrumented Hybrid III arm, the RAID was not designed to assess the potential for injury resulting from contact with other aspects of the automotive interior or with occupants. However, the relationships between the measures obtained in this study and the probability of human-forearm fracture under the same conditions are again unknown. The present study used static deployment of driver airbags into the forearms of unembaimed cadavers to directly investigate the subject and proximity factors associated with airbag-induced forearm fracture, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved. A primary goal of the research was to provide a biomechanical link between measurements made in simple, static, airbag-deployment tests and fracture of cadaver forearms, and to identify predictive measures of driver-airbag-related forearm fracture potential. In the absence of definitive dynamic-fracture- tolerance data, some studies have produced results equally important to the investigation of forearm-airbag interaction. Messerer (1880) determined the load and moment required to produce failure in twelve human radii and ulnae using a three-point bending approach, noting that the load at which forearm bones foil is largely dependent on the direction of the applied load relative to the cross-sectional shape of the bones. Jurist and Foltz (1977) examined the static stiffness and failure load of forty-five embalmed human ulnae in bending created by anteroposterior loading, concluding that bone strength and resistance to fracture correlate best with stiffness, followed very closely by mineral content. Mennen (1989) performed quasi-static three-point bending tests on the forearms of thirty-two anesthetized chacma baboons, 3664</page><page sequence="3">showing forearm bone strength to be related to age, gender, and, most significantly, body weight. These concepts were used in the design of the present study, and as an aid in structuring the analyses. METHODS Unembalmed human cadavers were used to investigate upper-extremity injuries resulting from direct interaction with driver airbags. Static deployments were conducted using a steering-wheel-and-airbag assembly mounted to a fixed platform. The platform was designed to support a rigid seat and an adjustable, simulated windshield and roof assembly (not used in these tests), as shown in Figure 1. The cadavers were seated in a pseudodriving posture with the arm positioned in the path of the deploying airbag. Multiple deployments were performed into some forearms, using forearm-to-airbag module spacing between 10 cm and direct contact. Figure 1. The static airbag-deployment platform with windshield and roof in place. The forearms of each specimen were instrumented prior to testing. Crack detection gages were used to determine fracture timing. A dual-marker target mast was used to track midforearm motion via high-speed film. Triaxial arrays of linear accelerometers were used to measure proximal and distal accelerations, and to calculate forearm speeds. Airbag pressure was monitored via L-shaped taps positioned to avoid the influence of internal gas jets and interaction with the expanding inflators. Film data were gathered at rates between 1000 and 6000 frames per second using lateral and overhead cameras. The crack detection gages used in this study were 2.5 cm long, single-element strain gages with large bonding pads. Each gage was wired in series with one arm of a full Wheatstone bridge. The gages were pre-wired using 30-gauge wire and miniature connectors. High-gain signal conditioning was used so that when a crack detection gage broke, suggesting bone fracture, a distinct voltage-level shift was observed. The solder connections were insulated with conformai coating and tested in normal saline prior to use. The target mast consisted of a 15.2-cm brass tube with two plastic spheres, one at the end and one 5 cm from the end. The triaxial accelerometer clusters were oriented such that the local positive X axis corresponded anatomically to distal, Y to lateral, and Z to posterior. However, because the individual components of acceleration were not analyzed, precise orientation of the clusters was not required. To facilitate instrumentation of the forearm, two incisions were made on the posterior aspect of the forearms following the radius and ulna. The radius incision began 2.5 cm from the elbow and ended 2.5 cm from the wrist. The ulna incision began mid-forearm and ended 2.5 cm from the wrist. The interosseous ligament was preserved as much as was practical. The posterior aspects of the forearm bones were exposed, and the surfaces were cleaned with acetone. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate was applied to these surfaces and allowed to cure. Accelerometer-mounting blocks were attached to the proximal and distal portions of the radius, as depicted in Figure 2. These blocks were made of Delrin, with four rounded feet and two slots through which wire ties were passed. A tensioning tool was used to tighten the wire ties after the blocks were positioned. The center of the distal mount was positioned roughly 30 percent of the radius length from the radius styloid. Similarly, the Delrin target-mast block was attached to the middiaphysis of the radius. Cyanoacrylate adhesive and a Teflon application tool were used to install three gages on the radius in proximal, middiaphysis and distal locations. Two gages were installed on the middiaphysis and distal portions of the ulna as well. The wounds were sutured using umbilical tape, leaving the instrumentation blocks exposed. Figure 2. A typical forearm preparation prior to suturing showing gage and instrumentation mount locations. After instrumentation of the forearms, the head and face of the specimen were protected with a heavy cotton wrap, and the hands and head were covered with a double-over knotted stockinet material. The cadaver was then dressed in footed dance tights and leotards. Small holes were cut in the fabric on each forearm for instrumentation access. A webbing harness was 3665</page><page sequence="4">attached to the cadaver and postinstrumentation, pretest x-rays were taken. The forearms were imaged in pronation and supination. For testing, the cadavers were seated in the rigid test seat, which has a 22-degree seatback angle. The steering column was inclined from 30 to 45 degrees to the horizontal. The cadaver was offset laterally from the center of the steering wheel to allow free motion of the entire extremity, and the feet were placed at the toe board with a moderate bend at the knees. The thorax of the cadaver was then secured to the seat using additional seatbelt webbing. The triaxial-accelerometer clusters and the target mast were installed on their respective mounting blocks. Following the final connecting of the crack detection gages, the cables were bundled and sutured to the shoulders. The forearm was wrapped lightly with utility tape to constrain the cables, and the arm was positioned such that the middle of the pronated forearm was perpendicular to the module tear seam at the center of the module. The hand and wrist were held loosely in place with perforated tape. Grip forces were not simulated because computer simulations conducted as part of this study, as well as by Sieveka et al. (1997), suggest that grip force has a negligible contribution to the overall kinematics. Soft foam was placed under the elbow and wrist to assist with spacing and positioning. The angle of the elbow ranged between 80 and 100 degrees. Thick padding was placed over the exposed seatback edges to eliminate extraneous injuries and to protect the instrumentation. Between tests, the forearms were examined for the presence of fracture by manual palpation, x-ray, crack detection gage output and visual inspection. In the absence of fracture following a noncontact test, additional tests were conducted with some forearms with reduced spacing between the forearm and the airbag module. Tests T27 and T28 are sequential tests conducted on a single forearm in which the forearm- airbag spacing was reduced from 2.5 cm to direct contact (zero spacing), as illustrated by Figure 3 and Figure 4. After completing a test series, the instrumentation was disconnected and forearm fractures were splinted. Posttest x-rays were taken, and the arms were disarticulated at the glenohumeral joint, frozen and stored for later autopsy. At autopsy, forearm anthropometry was taken, injuries were documented, and portions of the forearm bones were ashed. For ashing, 2 cm of the distal one-third of the radius and ulna were removed, cleaned, and rinsed with both distilled water and acetone. The bones were dried in a furnace and weighed. Ashing was performed at 700 degrees C for eight hours. The rate of mineralization and mineral content were calculated. Transverse-perspective photographs were taken to estimate the cross-sectional area of each bone. Nineteen static deployments were conducted using seven cadavers, three male and four female, as summarized in Table 1. The average age is 77 years. Figure 3. A representative 2.5 cm proximity test. Figure 4. A direct-contact test, which was performed subsequent to the test shown in Figure 3. The average stature and mass are 168 cm and 60 kg, respectively. Both the right and left arms of each specimen were tested. Prototype airbags were used with 350x22 and 424x17 kPa inflators. The inflators are described in terms of the peak gage pressure (e.g., 350 kPa) and the peak rate of pressure increase (e.g., 22 kPa/ms) obtained during a tank test. This test involves discharging the inflator into a 0.0283-cubic-meter-volume tank. The peak rate of pressure increase, or slope, is found from taking an average over 5 ms as described by Melvin et al. (1993). The internal pressure parameters measured during an airbag deployment may vary greatly from the numbers obtained during a tank test due to the characteristics of an individual airbag module and the possible interaction with outside influences such as the mass of a forearm. Although two inflator types were used, one type of airbag fold and one single-horizontal-tear-seam module were used in all tests. The airbags had a diameter of 66 cm and a full-inflation volume ranging between 50 and 66 liters. The airbags also had four tethers and two vents. The airbag modules measured approximately 20.5 cm horizontally and 18.0 cm vertically, with the tear seam located 13.5 cm from the top of the module. The modules were not sealed at the sides and had no inner containers. 3666</page><page sequence="5">Spacing from the forearm to the airbag module was reduced between consecutive tests in the same forearm from 10 cm to contact in 2.5-cm increments, for some test series. Nine deployments were conducted using a direct-contact condition (0.0-cm spacing), five using 2.5- cm spacing, three using 5.0-cm spacing and one was conducted using a 10.0-cm spacing condition. One entrapment simulation was also conducted, but is not included in the kinematic analyses of this study. Forearm fracture incidence was examined with respect to test conditions, specimen attributes, and kinematic data. Of primary interest are peak and average distal forearm speed, and fracture timing. The analysis methods are presented in conjunction with the results. RESULTS A complete tabulation of the test conditions and results is presented in Table A.1 of Appendix A. A complete catalog of the observed injuries is presented in Appendix B. A relational overview of the results is presented in graphical form in Appendix C. Table 2 summarizes the key results of the nineteen tests. The tests are numbered T15 through T33, since the tests conducted prior to T15 involved anthropomorphic test devices and are not included as part of this study. Tests T22 and T29 were excluded from the general analyses. Test T22 was an entrapment simulation that was very dissimilar to the other tests. Severe arthritis restricted the elbow extension of the specimen used in test T29 to less than 110 degrees, creating an abnormal stiff coupling of the forearm and the upper arm, dramatically changing the kinematics of the test. The arm used in test T29 was included in mineral content and mass evaluations, but was not included in the kinematic analyses. Thus, seventeen tests were used for kinematic analyses, while all fourteen arms were considered for nonkinematic analyses. A few of the parameters presented in Table 2 require explanation. Upper-extremity mass was measured after exposing the head of the humerus, and excising tissue in a circumferential fashion. Peak distal forearm speed (PDFS) was calculated by taking the peak resultant magnitude of integrated triaxial accelerations within the first 12 ms after the onset of speed. No compensation was made for angular velocity or centripetal acceleration effects. The acceleration signals were processed per channel-class-1000 specifications (SAE, 1990). Average distal forearm speed (ADFS) was estimated by integrating distal forearm speed to obtain a path-length time history of the distal forearm. This curve was evaluated at 10 and 90 percent of the displacement obtained after 12 ms. The difference between these two values was divided by the time between them to give average distal forearm speed, similar to the technique outlined by Cavanaugh et al. (1994). The 12-ms limit was selected to reduce the influence of integration errors and to minimize the effects of forearm rotation while including the important kinematic information. To this end, high- speed films showed the forearm motion to be largely planar. The initial motion was generally translational and comparatively small, as the inertia of the forearm kept it in the path of the deploying airbag. The motion became more rotational as the forearm began to lose contact with the airbag, and became very general after the forearm lost contact with the airbag.

Figure 5 is an x-ray of a pronated right forearm tested in a direct-contact configuration in the laboratory (Test T32). It shows simple fractures of the distal ends of both the radius and ulna, although the jagged nature of the ulna fracture creates the illusion of a wedge fracture in this image. Table 2 summarizes the number of distinct ulna and radius fractures observed for each test. As indicated, both male and female specimens sustained fractures. These fractures can be divided into three general categories: simple, wedge and complex, as suggested by Mueller (1990). They are cataloged in Appendix B. Figure 5. A post-test x-ray illustrating the nature of some of forearm fractures observed in this study. Forearm-fracture timing was determined from the output of five crack detection gages (CDG) that were installed on the bones of the forearms. Fractures of either the radius or ulna were found in eight of the seventeen tests (47 percent). Missing fracture timing data were a result of either gages not spanning a fracture, wires broken during a previous test or wires broken during the test itself. The available crack detection gage information indicated that fractures occurred between 5 and 10 ms after the onset of airbag pressure, supporting the use of a 12-ms limit for analysis of distal forearm speed. Peak airbag pressure occurred at approximately 5 ms. For the fractures captured by the crack detection gages, the fracture timing was shown to coincide with local reductions in acceleration, and local speed plateaus. Figures 6 and 7 (Tests T28 and T32) illustrate these phenomena. Time histories of airbag pressure, resultant distal acceleration and distal speed are plotted with crack detection gage output. Time zero is defined as the onset of internal-airbag pressure. The units are arbitrary, but are the same for each plot. The crack detection gage outputs, which indicate fracture, are the sharp vertical transitions. Each transition is associated with a commensurate drop in resultant distal acceleration, and a distal speed plateau. Integrated distal forearm speeds show that fractures occur within 5 to 10 cm of initial forearm position. The declines in distal forearm acceleration magnitude and concomitant speed plateaus coincide with fracture, because as the energy from the airbag is being dissipated by fracturing bones, the amount of energy from the airbag being used to move the forearm as a whole is reduced. This concept applies regardless of the specific fracture mechanism involved, even though it provides only a partial explanation for the observed kinematic effects. 3668</page><page sequence="7">T28 AirbƒÖg Pressure, Resultant Distal Forearm Acceleration.

Higher correlations and smaller intervals represent a better fit. Due to the small sample size, quantitative results should be interpreted cautiously. BONE MINERAL CONTENT AND FRACTURE - The association between mineral content and fracture incidence is shown in Figure 8 for the direct-contact (0.0 cm spacing) condition tests. Similarly, this association is shown in Figure 9 for the 2.5-cm spacing tests. Data for each radius and ulna are plotted independently, as fracture of one of the forearm bones is not necessarily accompanied by fracture of the other. As indicated in Figure 8, there is a clear division between fracture and nonfracture cases at 1 .03 g/cm for the contact condition. This division shifts to 0.43 g/cm for the 2.5-cm condition, suggesting that an increase in spacing Probability of Fracture (@ 0.0 cm) vs. Mineral Content Fx/NoFx 8 ~ + x X" ¬ªK x x* S ¬£ I g , g 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8 Q.

The relationship between fracture occurrence and mineral content for the 2.5 cm proximity condition. from the airbag module affords some protection to forearms with lower mineral content. Mineral content is expressed in grams of ash per centimeter of dry bone length. This is generally considered to be a more significant parameter than rate of mineralization, expressed in grams of bone ash per grams of dry bone since the quantity of bone available is as important as the quality of the bone, and mineral content reflects both quantity and quality of bone. The mineralization rates found in this study are in keeping with those described by Trotter and Peterson (1955). BODY MASS AND MINERAL CONTENT - The relationship between body mass and mineral content for the specimens involved in this study is shown in Figure 10. Age-normalized mineral content of each forearm bone was used to generate this plot, resulting in twenty- eight points from seven cadavers. The mineral contents were linearly normalized with respect to the average age of the specimens. Each mineral content was multiplied by the corresponding specimen age and divided by the 3669</page><page sequence="8">average specimen age. The result is an approximately linear increase in mineral content with increase in body mass. Body mass was used instead of stature because a higher correlation was found between mineral content and body mass than between mineral content and stature within this study. The points that deviate furthest from the regression are from a heavy female. Figure 1 1 shows the generally linear increase in upper- extremity mass found with increase in body mass. The rationale for the separation of these two relationships is that a greater correlation was found between mineral content and body mass than between mineral content and upper-extremity mass within this study. However, kinematic quantities such as peak distal forearm speed are more closely related to upper-extremity mass than to body mass. Figure 12 illustrates the decrease in peak distal forearm speed that accompanies an increase in upper- extremity mass. This trend is observed by limiting the analysis to a single inflator type used in subfracture or limited-fracture conditions, since fracture can alter the kinematics substantially. The analysis is also limited to a single initial spacing (2.5 cm) between the forearm and airbag. Only three points from tests T19, T27 and T31 fit these criteria. The combination of low upper-extremity mass and comparatively few fractures makes T19 a usable point, since little energy is devoted to fracturing the forearm as opposed to accelerating it, and the decoupling of mass in the forearm is limited. DISTAL FOREARM SPEED AND FRACTURE - Thus far in the analysis, examination of the relationships between mineral content and fracture, mineral content and body mass, upper-extremity mass and body mass, and peak distal forearm speed and upper-extremity mass creates an indirect link between peak distal forearm speed and forearm fracture. Figure 13 presents this relationship directly. There is a distinct transition between fracture and nonfracture cases at about 15.2 m/s. The maximum peak distal forearm speed not resulting in fracture is 14.2 m/s, while the minimum speed resulting in fracture is 16.3 m/s. Alternatively, Figure 14 presents the relationship between average distal forearm speed and forearm fracture. This relationship is characterized by a narrower margin between fracture and nonfracture, with the threshold appearing near 1 1 .7 m/s. All of the tests, other than the two exceptions already noted, are used to generate these curves, regardless of inflator type. The use of average speed removes reliance upon the significance of a single peak measurement, possibly resulting in a more robust correlation with fracture.

Figure 15 illustrates this correlation for forearm-airbag-module direct-contact conditions. The nonlinear regression estimates a transition between fracture and nonfracture cases near 2.9 kg. However, for these sparse data, an equally descriptive vertical line could be drawn near 2.7 kg. By comparison, the mass of a fifth-percentile female upper extremity is approximately 2.3 kg, and the average upper-extremity mass in this study is 2.2 kg. When the forearm-airbag spacing is increased to 2.5 cm, the upper-extremity "threshold mass" decreases to 1.4 kg for this series of tests, as shown in Figure 16.

FOREARM-TO-AIRBAG SPACING AND DISTAL SPEED - Table 3 shows an approximately 30-percent reduction in peak distal forearm speed from the contact to 2.5 cm conditions, for arms of typical mass. Because lighter arms are accelerated more easily, and little energy is dissipated when fracturing weak bones, there is not such a pronounced difference from the contact to the 2.5-cm condition.

Fractures occurred in six of the nine cases (67 percent) in which the forearm was in contact with the airbag module, one of the five cases (20 percent) in which the forearm was spaced 2.5 cm from the airbag module, and in one of the three cases in which the forearm was spaced 5.0 cm or greater from the airbag module. Table 4 Decrease in Fracture Probability with Increased Spacing Forearm to airbag Fractured forearms/ spacing, cm forearms tested 00 6/9 05 1/5 5J) 1/2 10.0 I 0/1 The data in Tables 3 and 4 were obtained using multiple deployments into some forearms. When this was done, one forearm was always tested in a direct-contact configuration, and the other was tested using various forearm-to-airbag spacings. The spacing and direct- contact conditions were alternated between the left and right sides on successive specimens. This strategy helped determine the influence that previous testing might have had on fracture incidence. If a forearm was fractured in a contact condition after one or more proximity tests, and the contralateral-side forearm fractured during a single direct-contact condition test, then the influence of multiple tests on fracture outcome was considered to be small. At the very least, the proximity within which fracture did not occur was determined. In each series of multiple proximity tests, forearm fracture occurred in the direct-contact condition. For each of these cases, the opposite forearm was fractured in the direct-contact condition without having undergone any prior testing, suggesting that the influence of multiple testing upon fracture incidence is minimal in this study. 3672</page><page sequence="11">Fractures were observed in cases other than the contact condition, but these were cases where only a single test was performed on a given forearm. Furthermore, the fractures sustained by the forearms used in multiple tests were not more severe than those sustained by forearms used in a single comparable test. DISCUSSION GENERAL FINDINGS AND DISTAL FOREARM SPEED - The results of this study demonstrate that forearm fractures can result from a combination of direct airbag and module-cover loading of the forearm. While there are clearly similarities of the fractures produced by direct airbag loading in the laboratory to fractures resulting from airbag deployments in low-speed frontal crashes, there are also differences. In the laboratory tests, a large number of fractures occurred to the midshafts of the ulna and radius, while a larger percentage of airbag-induced fractures in vehicle crashes occur at the distal end of the radius and ulna and in the region of the wrist and hand. This suggests that many of the field injuries are caused by the arm and hand being flung into an interior component, rather than by direct loading of the airbag. In the static airbag-depioyment tests of this study, fractures generally occurred between 5 and 10 ms after the onset of internal airbag pressure and were associated with reductions in acceleration and distai- forearm-speed plateaus due to the reduced coupling between the distal and proximal forearm at the fracture site. For the conditions of these tests a correspondence between distal forearm speed and fracture was found, with the transition between fracture and no fracture occurring near 15.2 m/s for peak and 11.7 m/s for average distal forearm speed. Results also indicate that both arm mass and arm proximity to the airbag module are important factors with regard to the likelihood of fracture of the radius or ulna. It is likely that proximity of the forearm to the airbag module affects both the magnitude and the manner of energy transfer to the forearm, thereby affecting the likelihood of forearm fracture. Furthermore, bone strength, and therefore tolerance to fracture, increases with greater bone-mineral content and, within this study, higher body mass is associated with higher upper-extremity mass and higher bone-mineral content. Figure 17 illustrates this association between distal forearm speed and the probability of forearm fracture injury schematically. As indicated on the left of the diagram, greater forearm-to-airbag spacing, greater body mass, and improvements in airbag design that result in less energy transfer to the arm will reduce distal forearm speed. Similarly, as shown on the right side, these same three factors influence the likelihood or probability of fracture through the amount of energy imparted to a forearm and the tolerance of the forearm to fracture. Increased airbag-to-forearm spacing and improvements in airbag design will reduce the energy imparted to the forearm that is available to produce fracture. Also, greater body mass results in increased bone mineral content with a consequent increase in bone strength. Both increased bone strength and reduced energy imparted to the forearm reduce the probability of fracture.

The relationships of airbag, upper-extremity mass and proximity factors to distal forearm speed and the probability of forearm fracture. 3673</page><page sequence="12">The independent variables that influence distal forearm speed and forearm tolerance to fracture are the same. In addition, changes in these variables cause distal forearm speed and the probability of fracture to change in parallel to each other (e.g., increased spacing reduces both speed and fracture). Therefore, there is a good and potentially robust correspondence between speed and fracture. The measure of speed takes into account bone tolerance factors (higher tolerance and therefore reduced likelihood of fracture are reflected by higher mass which results in lower speed), airbag aggressivity (more aggressive modules increase speed and increase the likelihood of fracture), and forearm proximity (closer spacing increases speed and increases the likelihood of fracture). These results suggest that the potential for forearm fracture resulting from upper-extremity airbag-interaction can largely be assessed by posing the question: Is the airbag system capable of imparting enough energy to a given forearm to accelerate it to a given speed? Both the amount of energy available and the method in which energy is delivered to the forearm are important. If there is enough energy available to accelerate a lighter, weaker forearm to a given speed, there is a good chance that there is enough energy available to fracture the forearm. Likewise, if a greater amount of energy is available to accelerate a heavier, stronger forearm to the same speed, there is a good chance that there is enough energy available to fracture that forearm as well. Because stronger, heavier forearms are more difficult to accelerate than weaker, lighter forearms, a common fracture threshold for all may be reflected in distal f√ºrearm speed. Further tests and biomechanical data are needed to confirm whether these relationships between distal forearm speed, mass, bone tolerance, airbag aggressivity, and proximity result in a good predictor of forearm fracture across a range of these variables. IMPLICATIONS FOR A FOREARM-FRACTURE ASSESSMENT TOOL - These results and relationships also suggest that a tool to assess the potential for airbags to cause forearm fractures might be based on measurement of distal forearm speed using a surrogate arm similar to the RAID, presented by Kuppa et al. (1997), but without the complexity of multiple strain-gage arrays and with greater biofidelity. Because of the importance of the kinematics of upper-extremity airbag interaction, the biofidelity of the surrogate arm, including tissue properties, mass, segment length, joint properties, and mass distribution may be extremely important, particularly if the speed-tolerance values derived from cadaver data are to be used directly. Also, because the kinematics measured in the absence of fracture are most indicative of the energy imparted to the forearm, a device that does not fracture should be used to assess the potential for fracture. Alternatively, it may be possible to establish values of distal forearm speed for a less biofidefic arm, such as the RAID, that correspond to fracture injury probability. Further experimental and simulation studies are needed to evaluate the importance of the design of a surrogate arm with regard to response kinematic biofidelity from airbag-deployment loading. STATIC VERSUS DYNAMIC TESTING AND SPECIMEN AGE - There are two important differences between the tests conducted in this study and the circumstances of airbag-induced forearm fractures in vehicle crashes. The tests were conducted under static conditions for the surrogate driver and forearm, and the tests used cadavers instead of live humans. In a frontal crash there will likely be some movement of the driver and forearm toward the airbag module. Under these circumstances, the effective mass of an upper-extremity segment at the time of interaction with the airbag will be a multiple of the segment deceleration in Gs. The influence of this increase in effective mass on the magnitude and manner of energy transfer to the forearm (relative to the energy transferred in the static-loading conditions of this study) is unknown but will be investigated in future work. In addition, the role of soft tissues and the coupling of these tissues to the bones of the forearm will be examined. There are two issues associated with the use of unembalmed cadavers instead of live humans. One is the difference between living and dead tissues, and the other is the issue of age effects on bone tolerance. The first concern is minimized by the fact that the injuries of interest in this study are to the bones of the forearm, which are expected to have changed very little in composition within a few days of death. For example, Greenberg et al. (1968) investigated the differences between in-vivo and fresh in-situ strength characteristics of the tibia-fibula complex in dogs and showed changes of less than 5 percent. Although the influence of muscle activity in the living-human forearm on the results of this type of testing is unknown, the modeling efforts of Sieveka et al. (1997) suggest that grip force has a negligible influence. Therefore, it is possible that muscle activity in general may have little effect. The second concern of subject age is, however, a more significant factor. Zhou et al. (1996) reviewed literature addressing age-related changes and injury tolerance. As part of their study, the work of many authors concerning fracture tolerance and energy- absorption ability of various human bones was applied to thoracic injury. Changes in static tolerance were cited as important, but changes in the ability to absorb dynamically applied energy are said to be greater and of greater importance, especially when considering a 20- though-80-year-old population. Zhou et al. (1996) referenced a study by Currey (1979) who conducted a series of pendulum impact tests using multiple specimens cut from 39 human femurs to investigate the reduction in energy-absorption capability with increased age. Although not stated by the authors, if the data are analyzed to compare 75-to-35-year-old specimens, an approximately 33-percent reduction in absorbed energy is found. However, the absorbed energy changes little when the analysis is narrowed to the specimens ranging from 50 to 80 years. 3S74</page><page sequence="13">Since the average age of the cadavers used in this study is 77 years, it can be expected that the fracture tolerance of the bones of the forearms used in this study might be low compared with the distribution of forearm bone tolerance for the driver population. However, airbag-design criteria based on these older specimens will provide a conservative measure of airbag performance that will ensure protection for a large percentage of the driver population. Although there are probably significant differences in static tolerance and dynamic-energy absorption between very young and very old bones, the data obtained from older cadaver specimens can be applied to a large portion of society. For example, the results of this study might be interpreted for application to a younger population of drivers. Using the 33-percent decrease in energy-absorption capability developied from the data of Currey (1979) (for persons in their midseventies compared to persons in their midthirties), the distal- forearm-speed threshold for a younger group can be estimated as 13.4 m/s (the square root of the product, 1 .33 times the square of 1 1 .6 m/s). FUTURE RESEARCH REGARDING INERTI AL FACTORS AND AIRBAG-INDUCED FLING INJURIES - Future experimental and modeling research is planned to further investigate and clarify the relationships between forearm fractures and the subject and proximity factors observed in this study. Investigations of the factors and conditions that result in airbag fling-induced fractures, as well as investigations into the effects of arm inertial loading on the airbag module, are also planned. Results will be used to develop and evaluate a simple static- deployment test fixture and associated methodology for assessing the potential for steering-wheel airbags to produce forearm fracture. CONCLUSIONS Static deployments of driver airbags have been conducted in a laboratory environment to study the factors involved in forearm fractures resulting from direct interaction between the forearm and airbag. The results indicate that: ‚Ä¢ Forearm fractures similar to those observed in field investigations can result from direct loading of the airbag into the forearm. ‚Ä¢ Forearm fractures caused by direct-airbag loading occur between 5 and 10 ms after the onset of internal airbag pressure. ‚Ä¢ The occurrence of forearm fractures is a function of both human tolerance and proximity of the forearm to the airbag module at the time of deployment. ‚Ä¢ Human tolerance to fracture is a function of bone- mineral content, which is a function of body and upper-extremity mass and subject age. ‚Ä¢ Forearm fractures are associated with reductions in distal forearm acceleration and plateaus of distal forearm speed. ‚Ä¢ Distal forearm speed, which is a function of both forearm mass and forearm proximity to the airbag module, appears to be a good predictor of the likelihood of forearm fracture. ‚Ä¢ A simple airbag-aggressivity-assessment tool could be based on measurement of distal forearm speed using static airbag deployments into a biofidelic, surrogate arm of appropriate mass.
