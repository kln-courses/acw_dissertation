Effects of UMTS Cellular Phones on Human Hearing: Results of the European Project "EMFnEAR". Radiat. Res. Ill, 244^-251 (2009). The European project EMFnEAR was undertaken to assess potential changes in human auditory function after a short- term exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation produced by UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) mobile phones. Participants were healthy young adults with no hearing or ear disorders. Auditory function was assessed immediately before and after exposure to radiofrequency radiation, and only the exposed ear was tested. Tests for the assessment of auditory function were hearing threshold level (HTL), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), contralateral suppression of transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (CAS effect on TEOAE), and auditory evoked potentials (AEP). The exposure consisted of speech at a typical conversational level delivered via an earphone to one ear, plus genuine or sham RF-radiation exposure produced by a commercial phone controlled by a personal computer. Results from 134 participants did not show any consistent pattern of effects on the auditory system after a 20-min UMTS exposure at the maximum output of the phone with 69 mW/kg SAR in the cochlea region in a double blind comparison of genuine and sham exposure. An isolated effect on the hearing threshold at high frequencies was identified, but this was statistically nonsignificant after correction for multiple comparisons. It is concluded that UMTS short-term exposure at the maximum output of consumer mobile phones does not cause measurable immediate effects on the human auditory System. © 2009 by Radiation Research Society 1 Address for correspondence: Istituto di Ingegneria Biomedica ISIB, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milano, Italy; e-mail: marta.parazzini@polimi.it. INTRODUCTION Mobile phones have become widely used throughout the world in a relatively short time. Although there is no clear evidence of harmful physiological effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation at the levels used by these devices, there is widespread public concern that there may be potential for harm. The potential adverse effects of mobile phone exposure on the hearing system should be investigated, because mobile phones are usually held close to the ear. The external ear may provide a natural route by which RF radiation emitted by mobile phones may reach the peripheral and central nervous system, leading to relatively high energy deposition in the ear. Moreover, the hearing sensory cells are highly sensitive to exogenous and endogenous agents, and hence they could constitute one specific target for possible threat to health. In the recent past, the technological scenario has changed. After about one decade of mobile phones based on the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard, a new standard was intro- duced based on the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecom- munications System) standard. UMTS is expected to completely replace GSM in the near future. The two standards differ in terms of the frequency (900, 1800 and 1900 MHz for GSM, 2100 MHz for UMTS) and modulation of the signals. In 2002, the European Commission in its 5th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development established the GUARD project, "Poten- tial Adverse Effects of GSM Cellular Phones on Hearing" (2002-2004), to address the potential effects of GSM cellular phones on the hearing systems of laboratory animals and humans (1-8). Although the GUARD results showed no effect on the auditory system due to GSM exposure, there is still social concern 244</page><page sequence="2">EFFECTS OF UMTS CELLULAR PHONES ON AUDITORY SYSTEM 245 regarding UMTS exposure. As a consequence, in 2004, the DG Health &amp; Consumer Protection of the European commission established the EMFnEAR project, "Expo- sure at UMTS Electromagnetic Fields: Study on Potential Adverse Effects on Hearing" (2004-2007), to explore the possible influence of the UMTS technology on the hearing systems of animals and humans. In this paper, we describe the pooled analysis of the data obtained in the course of the EMFnEAR project on the possible effects of exposure to UMTS-modulated electromagnetic fields on the auditory system of humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants and Screening Acceptance as a participant was based on a screening procedure that was used in the GUARD project (2). Briefly, participants were healthy young adults (18-30 years) with no evidence of hearing or ear disorder, corresponding to the ISO definition of otologically normal. Similar numbers of males and females were included. The rationale was to test a group that was representative of the population of young otologically normal people. The absence of pre-existing hearing or ear disorders maximizes the sensitivity of the study to detect small changes that may occur. Acceptance as participants was based on otoscopy, audiometry by air conduction and bone conduction, tympanometry and acoustic reflex testing, transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions, and a simple screening questionnaire concern- ing medical and otological history, to be filled in by the subject in the presence of the investigator. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committees of the institutions involved in the experiments. Assessment of Auditory Function The assessment of auditory function was based on a conventional battery of tests (see below for descriptions of measures) typically used for audiological assessment both of peripheral and of central hearing function in clinics: hearing threshold level (HTL) by pure tone audiometry (PTA), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) using DP-gram and input-output (I/O) function measure- ments, contralateral acoustic stimulation during transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (CAS effect on TEOAE), and auditory evoked potentials (AEP). The tests were performed immediately before and after exposure to RF radiation (see below for exposure protocol). The equipment used varied among laboratories. As a consequence, there were minor variations in the implementation and parameters of the test protocols among laboratories. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) is a standardized behavioral procedure for measurement of hearing threshold level (HTL) that enables the determination of the degree, type and configuration of a hearing loss. This measure involves the peripheral and central auditory systems. In this study, the HTLs were recorded by air conduction using a 2-dB step size and an ascending threshold procedure at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz. The HTL shifts for each test frequency were computed from measurements before and after exposure (after minus before). Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are often used in laboratories and clinics as a measure of inner ear health. OAE are low-intensity acoustic signals emitted by the healthy cochlea into the ear canal. They are associated with normal nonlinear active mechanisms in the cochlear outer hair cells. The OAE recordings are a sensitive and reliable method to assess in vivo cochlear functionality; their presence is an indicator of normal contractile outer hair cell activity. They are suitable for identifying subtle changes or effects of minor damage to the outer hair cells (OHC), and the frequency of change in OAE reflects the frequency location of damage to the cochlea. Two commonly measured types of OAE are Distortion Product Otoa- coustic Emission (DPOAE) and Transiently Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE). In the case of DPOAE, the stimuli are two pure tones (primaries) at frequencies Fl and F2 and sound pressure levels LI and L2, respectively; in the case of TEOAE, the stimulus is an acoustic click of brief duration. In this study, DPOAEs were recorded and the related DP-grams and I/O functions (see below) were analyzed. DP-gram: DPOAE were recorded in the so-called DP-gram paradigm using fixed intensities of the primary tones (LI and L2) and a fixed frequency ratio (F2/F1) at increasing Fl and F2 frequency values. Specifically, the frequency ratio F2/F1 was set equal to 1.22 and the primary tone levels were fixed at the following combination of LI and L2: 60/50 dB SPL and 50/40 dB SPL. The tones were swept with F2 covering the range 2 to 6 kHz in 1/16-octave steps. For each step, measurement of the DPOAE used signal averaging for 6 s or until a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 15 dB was reached, whichever occurred first. The DPOAE amplitudes averaged across the F2 frequencies were calculated and their shifts before and after exposures were considered as measures for statistical analysis. I/O function: An input-output (I/O) function was measured for F2 = 2 and 4 kHz and the following combinations of LI and L2: 50/35, 55/40, 60/50, 65/60 and 70/70 dB SPL. These combinations approximate the "scissor-level" paradigm of Kummer et al. (9). Also, in this case, the DPOAE amplitude shifts were analyzed by comparing before and after exposures for each stimulus combination. The recording of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) from one ear during contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) (i.e., a controlled sound or noise in the contralateral ear) is a non-invasive and objective technique for functional exploration of the auditory efferent system that synapses directly with the cochlear outer hair cells via cholinergic synapses (10-16). In this study, TEOAE were recorded using the linear mode of measurement at five different intensities (3-dB steps between the different intensities), with intensities within the ear canal from 57 dB peak SPL to 69 dB peak SPL. The order of the different click intensities was randomized. For each stimulus, two TEOAE were recorded: one with and one without the contralateral acoustic stimulation that consisted of 35 dB SPL white noise. Recording comprised six epochs of 80 clicks (three with and three without CAS), corresponding to 480 averaged responses (240 with and 240 without). If the rejection rate was higher than 15%, the recording was repeated. For each stimulus intensity, the TEOAE amplitude suppression (i.e., the difference between the amplitude of TEOAE recorded without and with the contralateral acoustic stimulation) was calculated and the shifts related to suppression before and after exposure were computed. To investigate the alterations in both sensory and central nervous system processing of auditory information due to the exposure, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were also recorded using a classic oddball paradigm in which auditory frequent (non-target) and infrequent (target) stimuli are presented binaurally to the subject. AEP are very small electrical voltage potentials originating from the brain recorded from scalp electrodes in response to an auditory stimulus and are used to trace the signal generated by a sound along the auditory pathway. In this study, middle latency AEP components (conventionally labeled Nl and P2: AEP peaks occurring around 100 and 200 ms after the stimulus) were examined from non-target responses, whereas late potentials (labeled N2 and P3: AEP peaks occurring later and reflecting the detection by the brain of a change in the stimulus) were examined from responses to targets only. In particular, the late component P3, which is an endogenous response occurring in the 300-ms latency region with a large positive peak, is</page><page sequence="3">246 PARAZZINI ET AL. highly dependent on subject attention to auditory stimuli. AEP were recorded on three channels using six scalp electrodes at locations conventionally denoted Pz, Cz and Fz, all referenced to the nose with the forehead electrode (FPz) as ground. An electro-oculogram (EOG) was recorded using additional electrodes above and below the left eye. The stimuli were 30-ms tone bursts (10-ms rise and fall time) at 1000 Hz (frequent stimulus, 80%) and 1500 Hz (infrequent stimulus, 20%), delivered at 70 dB nHL (normal hearing level, corresponding to 70 dB SPL and 72 dB SPL, respectively) at a repetition rate of 1.1/ s. All data were EOG corrected, band-pass filtered from 1 to 30 Hz, recorded in epochs with an analysis windows of 600 ms, baseline corrected using the pre-stimulus interval, and averaged separately for target and non-target stimuli. After averaging, the four components (Nl, P2, N2 and P3) were identified visually, and the amplitude (measured as zero-to-peak values) and latencies were measured. Shifts in the latency of the Nl, P2 and N2 peaks and in both the amplitude and latency of the P3 peak were analyzed by comparing before and after exposures. Experimental Protocols The experimental paradigm used in this study was a within-subject design. This entailed assessment of the auditory function immediately before and immediately after exposure to the RF radiation. The procedure was conducted twice in a double-blind design: once with a real (test) exposure and once with a sham (control) exposure. This approach maximizes the sensitivity to change because between-subject variation is minimized both by calculating the difference between before and after measurements and by comparing real and sham conditions. Real and sham exposures were on separate days (at least 24 h apart) with the test participant and tester both blind to the condition being used. Audiological measurements were performed only on the exposed ear. The selection of the participant's right or left ear was based on the audiometric and audiological test results of the screening session. The principle was to select the ear with the better results on the main outcome measure(s) for the laboratory. This approach was designed to give maximum sensitivity to detect any change. The participants were asked to remove spectacle frames, earrings or any other metal ornaments on the pinna or close by that might alter the electromagnetic field generated by the phone. The participant was asked to perform a task to ensure that they paid attention to a speech stimulus (see below), such as counting the number of times a specific word occurs in the speech material. The participants were asked appropriate questions about the speech material immediately after the exposure. The purpose of this latter was to ensure that the participant had been actively listening to the speech material. For AEP measurements, electrodes were attached at the beginning of the session and remained in place for the entire session. Electrode contact impedance was lower than 5 kQ. Pre-exposure measurements were taken with the following order of tests: PTA, AEP, DPOAE, CAS TEOAE, while postexposure measurements were in the reverse order for each participant. After the pre-exposure measurements, the exposure system was adjusted and RF radiation was applied. Immediately after exposure, the postexposure measurements were carried out. The time at which each measurement was recorded relative to the end of exposure was logged and the electrodes were removed. Exposure and Positioning System The exposure, double blind and counterbalanced in order, consisted of speech at a typical conversational level delivered through an earphone to one ear plus RF-radiation exposure in either real or sham conditions to simulate the normal use of a phone. To prevent any possible effects from using the speaker in the handset, the speech material was delivered through an ER-3A insert earphone. The insert earphone delivered sound through an extended polythene tube that was taped along the participant's jaw with the end of the tube placed at the tragal notch of the outer ear. The speech signal had been prefiltered to correct for the altered frequency response of the earphone used in this way. This approach avoided cables or metal earphone parts close to the ear, which might distort the RF radiation. A system of phone fixation that allowed free head movement by the user was used in this study. It was designed and developed originally for the GUARD project [see ref. (i), Fig. 1]. The positioning holder had three main parts: a headband, an adjustable arm and a phone holder. All parts of the positioning system were made of non-metallic plastic materials to avoid any perturbation of the RF radiation emitted by the mobile phone. The exposure system used the normal output of an UMTS mobile phone (Nokia 6650) connected by serial cable to a personal computer and was controlled by special software to set the exposure parameters to the required frequency and power. The participants received UMTS exposure at full power at 1947 MHz for 20 min. The sham or genuine exposure was done using a "load" or a "dummy load". For this purpose an external power load was connected to the remote antenna connector of the phone. A 50-ohm resistive load and an open-circuit dummy load were developed for sham/exposed conditions with the same shape and structure. To confirm the effectiveness of the load, surface scanning of the phone by near field measurement was performed. The maximum measured field above the normal phone was 39.8 V/m at the bottom of the rod antenna. The field strength at any position above the loaded phone's surface (dummy phone) was less than 2 V/m, which is the nominal detection limit of the near field probe, confirming its effectiveness for the sham exposure. The relative power density between the two phones was more than 25 dB. The "load" intercepts the RF signal to the internal antenna on the phone and dissipates the RF signal in the load, while the "dummy load" looks identical but does nothing, allowing the RF signal to reach the antenna. Local overheating of the load with respect to the dummy load could not be detected by the participants because the load was connected on the back of the phone, with no direct contact with any part of the subject's body. During the exposure the phone was placed so that its longitudinal axis followed an imaginary line from the entrance to the ear canal to the corner of the mouth, in accordance with the CENELEC standard EN 50361 (77). To estimate the level of RF-radiation exposure in the inner ear region, measurements of absorbed radiofrequency power in the head, termed specific absorption rate (SAR, W/kg), were made in a TWIN SAM (Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin) phantom (Antennessa, France) filled with standard brain tissue-equivalent liquid in a phantom (Antennessa, France). In these measurements, a 3D step motor robot system (Arrick Robotics, 3-Axis Positioning Table), internal E-field probe (ER3DV4R, Schmid &amp; Partner Engineering Ag., Switzerland) connected to an EASY4 four-channel exposure acquisition system (Schmid &amp; Partner Engineering Ag.) and a non- metallic phone-positioning system were used; the phone was held on the phantom in the "touch position" according to CENELEC standard EN 50361 (17). The sensitivity of the system in the brain tissue-equivalent phantom was 0.005 W/kg. These measurements revealed a maximum SAR at a distance of 30 mm from the surface of the phantom, which corresponds approximately to that of the cochlea, of 69 mW/kg for the 1947 MHz frequencies, while for the loaded phone (dummy phone) the SAR was below the system detection limit of 0.005 W/kg. These values are well below 2 W/kg, which is the limit of the European Council recommendation 1999/519/ EC (18). The output of the phone had been measured previously using a frequency and power meter (Hewlett Packard 5 3 74 A) and circulators (RYT Industries, Santa Clara, CA) through the external antenna output of the phone. To satisfy our experimental protocol, the phones had to emit the same RF power throughout the course of the 20-min</page><page sequence="4">EFFECTS OF UMTS CELLULAR PHONES ON AUDITORY SYSTEM 247 FIG. 1.

The phone RF power uncertainty during the first 60 min was found to be below 2% using the highest power level at 1947 MHz. Statistical Analysis The Kolmogorov-Smiraov test indicated that all measures were approximately normally distributed, so parametric analyses were performed. To test whether there were any significant changes in the auditory function due to the UMTS exposure, a two-sided paired / test comparing sham and real exposures was performed on the shifts before and after a real or sham exposure of all the relevant measures identified previously. Since several statistical tests were performed simultaneously, a Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for potential occurrence of Type 1 errors. The statistical power was calculated before the experimental procedure was started to identify the number of subjects needed to obtain the desired minimum detectable effect size. The assumptions for the calculation were to use a two-tailed Student's t test for related samples with significance at P &lt; 0.05 for a power of 80%. These calculations revealed that the sample size n for each audiological test FIG. 2.

RESULTS A total of 134 participants (73 women and 61 men, mean age 24.5 years, SD 3.7) were tested across laboratories and across audiological tests in the expo- sure experiment. Not all participants were given all audiological tests; therefore, in the following, the number n of subjects on which the test was performed is indicated. The HTL shifts across subjects before and after real or sham exposure are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the audiometric frequencies tested and as a shift of the mean HTL values across frequencies between 2 and 8 kHz. The general trend was a worsening of the HTL (i.e., an increase of the HTL) after a real exposure compared to the sham; the largest mean shift for real exposure was less than 1 dB HL.

Figures 2-4 show the shifts for the averaged DP-gram amplitude, for the DPOAE I/O amplitude, and for the amplitude suppression of TEOAE, respectively, before and after a real or sham exposure as a function of the acoustic stimulus level applied. For the DP-gram (Fig. 2), the maximum average shift was 0.54 dB after a sham exposure (stimulus level 60/50 dB SPL), whereas for DPOAE I/O (Fig. 3), the maximum average shift was 1 dB after a sham exposure (4 kHz, stimulus level 50/35 dB SPL); both were in the direction of deteriora- tion of hearing. All these shifts were small enough to be within normal physiological variability. Moreover, statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in mean DPOAE shift (both DP-gram and I/O) for sham compared to real exposure. For TEOAE amplitude suppression (CAS TEOAE, Fig. 4), the maximum FIG. 5. AEP analysis: shift (after minus before) of the mean of latencies of auditory evoked potential peaks.

No statistically significant differences were found. Identical conclusions can be drawn from the results on auditory evoked potentials (Fig. 5), which were analyzed in terms of both latency (AEP peaks Nl, P2 and P3) and amplitude (only P3 peak). The maximum shift in latency was 9.15 ms for P3 after a sham exposure. The amplitude was measured for P3 only (57 subjects; not shown in Fig. 5) and resulted in average values of -0.53 nV (SE = 0.4) for real and -0.9 pV (SE = 0.4) for sham exposure, respectively. No statistically signif- icant differences were found. DISCUSSION The focus of this study was the interaction between RF radiation emitted by mobile phones and the auditory system in humans. Both peripheral and central hearing function were assessed after exposure to low-intensity electromagnetic fields produced by a commercial UMTS cellular phone. Until now, most studies have assessed the influence of RF radiation on the central or peripheral auditory system. Some investigators {19-27) studied the interac- tion between mobile phones and the central auditory system using auditory brainstem responses or the auditory event-related potential and most found no effect. However, two studies (19, 22) found an effect on neural activity. Some investigators (27-30) studied the interaction between mobile phone exposure and the inner ear, in particular the cochlear OHC using otoacoustic emissions, and concluded in general terms that no effects occur. However, clear conclusions cannot be drawn from these studies regarding the presence or absence of effects because of the limitations in the audiological and/or dosimetric approaches (sometimes not mentioned) and limited sample sizes. In contrast, the results described in the paper by Parazzini and colleagues (2) summarized the outcome of the EC Project GUARD on possible effects of GSM phones on the auditory function. The study design and protocols applied were suitable for drawing conclusions, and the results showed no effects on the main audiological measures related to exposure from the GSM RFR source. A small number of studies in the literature have dealt expressly with the possible influence of UMTS exposure on biological systems in humans, some of which were concentrated on interactions with CNS. In 2003, the results of Dutch study (31) on the effects of controlled exposure to UMTS fields at base station intensities on human well being and cognitive function were published (the so-called TNO study); UMTS-like exposure at an E-field strength of 1 V/m reduced well being (e.g., headache, nausea, sleep disturbances) in individuals with and without self-reported health complaints attrib- uted to daily life exposures. This outcome was not confirmed. In a replication study by Regel et al (32) that included both 1 V/m and 10 V/m exposure conditions, only cognitive performance was marginally affected in the higher E-field intensity group. Several recent studies have examined the effects of cellular phones (GSM or UMTS) on individual sensitivity and event-related potentials, and the results have often been inconsistent, showing effects only in particular conditions (33-36). The present study is the first to address the possible interactions of UMTS phones on the hearing system of humans. We found no general effects on the main audiological measures for short-term (20 min) exposure to a commercial UMTS phone. Only pure tone hearing threshold level measurements showed two values that were significantly different (see Fig. 1 at 500 Hz and MEAN) when sham and UMTS exposure were com- pared. However, no other audiological measures tested showed any sign of effect; hence no corroboration was found for the audiometric results. Although the presence of possible effects on hearing threshold levels cannot be dismissed entirely, the evidence available is not suffi- ciently strong to conclude that there are adverse effects. A replication study with a shift in hearing threshold levels at high frequencies as the a priori hypothesis is desirable to resolve this issue.
