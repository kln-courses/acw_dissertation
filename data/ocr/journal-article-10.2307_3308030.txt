<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRIMINAL, THE JUDGE, AND THE PUBLIC. By Franz Alexander and Hugo Staub. Translated by Gregory Zilboorg. The Macmillan Co., New York, I93I. PP. xx, 238. The authors, a psychoanalyst and a lawyer, collaborated four years on this book, engaging in the study of criminal cases, and in actual analytic work among criminals in Berlin. Its publication attracted wide attention, and Alexander and Staub organized a seminar for lawyers and judges at the Psychoanalytical Insti- tute of Berlin. Last winter Dr. Alexander lectured at the University of Chicago,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 147 and this year will lecture at the Judge Baker Foundation in Boston, so that his work is somewhat known among doctors and social workers in this country. But it is little known to members of the legal profession, and the book is, I venture to think, definitely important for lawyers to read. It is not easy reading, arranged in no orderly sequence; with unnecessary repetition, a sort of sloppiness of struc- ture resulting probably from the inevitable looseness of collaboration, and ex- pressed in the dreadful terminology-in the English translation at least-of psychoanalysis. So that the reader, unfamiliar with this particular jargon, may easily be discouraged by what will seem to him saying simple things in a compli- cated and heavy manner. But the authors' problem was not easy. Psychoanalysis, after all, is a comparatively young science, with an undeveloped and unaccustomed vocabulary; an approach not yet accepted by the medical fraternity, grossly mis- understood by the lay public, through its false over-simplification and populariza- tion; and doubtless irritating to lawyers whose categorica'ly-trained minds reject such a blurring of "moral" values. If, however, the book is read with an open and attentive mind, the authors' thesis will be found developed with power, lucidity and economy. What is that thesis? Analytical experience shows that conscious self-restraint of our primitive instincts is unimportant compared with fear of pain and expectation of pleasure. Social order is the equilibrium between the renunciation of our instinctual demands and their gratification-and the sense of justice regulates this equilib- rium, social recognition affording the expected pleasure. When justice miscarries the equilibrium gives way and the unconscious instincts are unchained. Witness the violent emotional storm surrounding the Sacco-Vanzetti case, in which the sense of justice of a large part of the community was shocked, resulting in a sudden resurgence of primitive instincts. The present system of justice is no longer supported by the affective forces of religion and loyalty but is a "mere matter-of-fact structure, poor in content with outlived institutions". The intro- duction of the jury, the rough psychological admission of "motive" in crime, the more modern use of the "expert" psychologist, is a recognition of the inelasticity of the law, unscientific and futile, in face of the rigid classification of crimes, and the lawmaker's tendency to shoulder responsibility for injustice on the written law. To all of which we might comment that the law is not a science, but, as Judge Holmes has, I think, somewhere said, an anthropomorphic document; and our authors would answer that this need no longer be the case, for psychoanalysis has made possible a scientific understanding of the criminal. n Our law moves in the abstract principles of the older psychology, obtaining no "pictorial knowledge" of the living personality which Freud's studies of the subconscious have made possible. A criminal acts from motives which are neces- sarily contradictory and largely unconscious. Our mechanism of confusion by cross-examination therefore is unsound. Most criminals are the result of environment, not heredity. The criminal like the child is a socially unadjusted being. The child builds up its "Super-Ego" (conscience) to control the demands of its subconscious nature. The criminal has not learned this psychological control; and the authority of the father to the child is reflected in the authority of the state to the criminal, the state being identified with the father. The neurotic's gratification and the punishment which accompanies it are self-inflicted; the neurotic criminal finds a similar gratification and punishment in realitv sought and inflicted in the outside world. Punishment therefore is not a deterrent but psychologically an attraction to such a criminal. In addition to the neurotic criminal (undeveloped child) there is the normal criminal (gangster) created by environment, whose ideals correspond with his acts, and the "pathological" criminal, organically conditioned (the epileptic, feeble-minded, etc.). The law deals adequately with the latter class; and punish-</page><page sequence="3">I48 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW ment, involving the postulate of freedom of will, fits the "normal" criminal, since his acts are consciously chosen. It is to the neurotic type, claimed to be by far the largest group, whose actions are conditioned by impulses hidden from con- sciousness that the attention of the book is chiefly addressed. And with respect to this type the theory of free will and responsibility is therefore psychologically unsound. The judge of the future must differentiate between conscious and unconsciotus causes, and for this purpose must be trained in analysis. The criminal rationalizes as well as the judge. We dislike and fear the unconscious, and our Western illusion of freedom of will is a substitute for our lost knowledge of ourselves. "Those who accept psychoanalysis accept and recognize the power of the unconscious; such recognition, however, signifies not a denial of, or a bowing to, the unconscious forces; it is instead the first step towards the real mastery of them." But even if we conclude that neurotic criminals should be treated as if they were sick, and "normal" criminals punished, yet no such scientific treatment can be made by a society which itself demands atonement, retaliation and revenge. Failure to punish where the public demands punishment would tend to weaken repressive controls. The criminal cases cited are not very convincing to a lay reader; and if he is a lawyer he will probably distrust the new knowledge, encroaching on his field of static and ordered arrangement. But even he may be sceptical of the criminal law's achievement in the world as it is; and will remember that the new knowledge has encroached on every other well-ordered preserve. Francis Biddle.
