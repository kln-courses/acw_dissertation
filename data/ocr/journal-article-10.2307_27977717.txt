<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 THE SPOTTED CAT AND THE HOFRIBLE BIRD; STYLISTIC CHANGE IN NASCA 1-5 CERAMIC DECORATION Elizabeth Parkass Wolfe Introduction The Nasca ceramic sequence of the Peruvian Early Intermediate Period represents nearly a millennium of uninterrupted regional develop ment. Stylistic renderings of the colorful, slip-painted mythical themes which decorate these vessels range from entirely representational to highly conventionalized or symbolic. Much of this decoration relates to such everyday pursuits as farming, fishing and hunting, yet even these depictions are esoteric, reflecting a complex world view which transforms the ordinary topics with symbolism and abstraction. Many centuries of development necessarily brought about changes in the cosmology, as well as in the mode of representation. This study deals with the stylistic development of two pro minent mythical beings of Nasca iconography: the Spotted Cat and the Horrible Bird.! My procedure was to arrange the depictions in sequen tial order, then investigate the nature and causes of the stylistic changes. A distinction was made between traits essential and unique to a given theme and variations which seemed optional, marginal or extra ordinary. The work was based initially on vessels in the collections of the Robert H. Lowie Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley? In order to offset possible bias, the sample was augmented by the inclusion of numerous published drawings and photographs as well as many unpublished photographs in Lawrence E. Dawsonfs Nasca reference file. Since most specimens used in the study lack proper archaeological association, relative chronology was established chiefly on stylistic grounds.2 To avoid the pitfalls of a circular argument, assignment of phase, where no gravelot associations were available, was determined on the basis of traits not used in the analysis. Spotted Cat and Horrible Bird depictions usually appear on Nasca vessels as the principal decorative theme. The frequency of the portrayals and their long continuity in the style argue convincingly for their importance in Nasca mythology. Their respective iconographie development will be followed here from the earliest known occurrence of each theme in the Nasca sequence to the disintegration of the portrayals as representational images. Sequential Development of the Spotted Cat Theme Antecedents The Spotted Cat theme of the Nasca ceramic sequence has direct antecedents in south coast textile designs and in the ceramic decoration of the Paracas style of the Early Horizon (figs. 1, 2). The ceramic</page><page sequence="2">2 depictions occur in both two- and three-dimensional forms and are quite conventional! zed ? Nasca 1 (figs. 3-6) The earliest known representations of the Spotted Cat in the Nasca style are partly modeled and slip-painted within incised outlines (figs. &gt;-6). These effigy vessels are more realistic than their ante cedents, even suggestive of the use of a natural model, perhaps the pampas cat (Felis colocolo) which still inhabits the south coast of Peru.3 Nasca 1 Spotted Cats prominently display paws teiminating in jagged claws, pelage markings, a softly curling tail, and long whiskers. Their carnivorous attributes are emphasized by the display of teeth (figs. 5&gt; 6), sharp canine teeth (fig. 6), and association with a cap tured small animal (rodent?) (fig. 3). Pig. 3c also shows an appendage possibly representing a leash attached to a collar around the feline1s neck, perhaps indicative of its tame status. There is no apparent sym bolism or mythical overtones in these renderings. Stylistically, the effigy vessels demonstrate an artistic accomodation of a naturally con ceived model to the traditional vessel forms. Thus, the animal may lie on top of the spouted vessel (figs. 3-5) or sit upright so that the ani mal body and the vessel form a single unit (fig. 6). The fur of the animal's head and back is usually dark (which is consistent with earlier traditions). Set against the dark-colored back are rhomboid or lenticu lar pelage markings of shining black. The somber effect is offset by the sharp color contrast of the striped legs and tail and the white ground color. The artist also attempted, at least once, to distinguish the dark, coarser fur of the back from the lighter, fluffy underside by adding a light-colored band to the lower part of the body outline (fig. 4). In the stylistic development the cat's whiskers increasingly resem ble mouth masks. When these counterparts become indistinguishable from the imitation (fig. 5) the natural whiskers are replaced by a representation of a mask (fig. 6). Nasca 2 (figs. 7-14) This stylistic phase witnesses the transition from slip painting within incised outlines to flat slip-painted ceramic decoration, although some incision is found in conservative pieces. Portrayals of the Spotted Cat seem to be mostly two-dimensional and by far the great est number depict the cat standing with the body and hind legs in pro file and the head, chest and forelegs shown front-face (figs. 7-12). These cats have characteristically arched backs with the tip of the tail turned up, occasionally curving back over the body (fig. 11). Pelage markings are still formalized and regularly spaced, but their form has changed. Most commonly they are semi-circular or a truncated oval with an irregular edge, but are sometimes crescent-shaped and always promi nently black-colored in sharp contrast to the light-colored background. The color and texture differences between the back and belly fur are sometimes marked with a separate band along the lower contour of the animal's body (figs. 7, 8, 10, 13, 14)? The treatment of limbs and tail is extremely varied. Some cats display jagged, extended claws (figs. 9&gt; 10, 14), others have rectangular paws with an even row of nails (figs.</page><page sequence="3">3 7, 11), while still others may he softly rounded (figs. 8, 12). Note that the treatment of front and hind legs may differ (fig. 14)? The markings on the legs and tail are also variable in this phase; spotted, striped, and solid-color tails all occur. Depictions of the head are rather conventionalized. The crown with flanking ears tends to form a trilobate composition set off from the lower part of the face. The eyes are large and rounded with prominent pupils. A mouth mask becomes stan dard although it clearly imitates naturalistic whiskers (see especially figs. 8, 12). These ornaments appear to be attached to the lower out line of the face, leaving the chin and nose area uncovered (figs. 9, 11, 14) or else seem to be "clipped" to the nose forming an open arc which surrounds the mouth (figs. 7, 8, 12). Note, however, that nostrils are consistently absent in these images except for the modeled version (fig. 13), which is also very advanced Phase 2 or possibly even very conserva tive Phase 3? The tongue in most Phase 2 cats is extended, sometimes issuing from such anatomically impossible places as above the lips (fig* 9) or below the mouth (fig. 12). Teeth are not frequently shown (figs. 7, 11) and I saw no canine teeth depicted. A few Phase 2 specimens depict a variant of the feline as seen from a bird1s eye view (fig. 14), corresponding to the earlier modeled cats which lie on top of a spouted vessel (figs. 3~5)? I have found, however, no two-dimensional portrayal of a seated cat. In this phase Spotted Cat designs frequently decorate double spout-and-bridge bottles which are sometimes designed to represent two vessels: a double-spout bottle on top and a low-sided bowl below (figs. 8, 12, 14)? The bowl is often decorated with fruit motifs or abstract designs which should not be construed as symbolic associations with the Spotted Cat theme, since the decoration of each of the component vessels is independent. In Phase 2 depictions of the Spotted Cat on ceramics rarely show symbolic associations which are, however, already present in textile decoration. Nasca 5 (figs. 15-25) Most depictions of the Spotted Cat in this phase appear as a stylistic continuation of the antecedents discussed above. The eyes are reduced in size and generally more elongated, the mouth mask becomes more stylized, less whiskerlike. The trilobate division of the head, frequently rendered with a prominent solid black crown (figs. 15, 16, 18, 2I-23), and the presence of horizontal pelage divisions are now estab lished stylistic traits. Pelage markings tend to be tulip- or crescent shaped, while the legs are mostly decorated with stripes rather than spots. Occasionally claws or a clawed thumb are still shown on the front legs (figs. 15, 16), but these conservative features appear less frequently than the more advanced ones. The tail is curved more sharply and usually terminates over the back. Association with fruits is indi cated by an attachment to the forepaw (figs. 21-23), replacement of the extended tongue by a fruit (fig. 20) or by a row of fruit along the horizontal pelage division as in fig. I3. Eyebrows make their debut but nostrils are not yet indicated with the exception of a modeled version (fig. 24) which otherwise displays all the stylistic attributes of the</page><page sequence="4">4 Nasca 3 phase. In this phase we see a clear division of the Spotted Cat into iconographie variants. The existence of these variants becomes yet more obvions in Phase 4 both because of the increase in the number of Spotted Cat representations and because of the proliferation of variants. We shall consider the cat we have been discussing as Variant 1 ? Variant 2 cats (fig. 25) differ from Variant 1 chiefly in that their head and front legs are oriented horizontally. This physically impossible ana tomical arrangement may have originated from the Phase 2 portrayals in which the animal is depicted as seen from above but with all four legs visible (fig. 14) or directly from the modeled Nasca 1 depictions (figs. 5-5). Nasca 4 (figs. 26-33) There is a marked increase in the number of Spotted Cat ren derings on ceramics in this phase. The frequency of portrayal facili tated the identification of several distinct variants of the theme. The iconographie succession of each of these will be discussed separately. Variant 1 (figs. 26, 27) These cats are the direct stylistic descendants of the Spotted Cat imagery of earlier phases. There is, however, a marked trend to conventionalization of already present traits. Common conventions are the trilobate head form, extended tongue, eyebrows, spotted back, striped legs, horizontal pelage division, almond-shaped eyes with pupils reduced in size. Teeth and claws are hardly ever present and the mouth mask is quite conventionalized; the belly is now seldom curved. Unreal istic repetition of design elements, for example multiple eyebrows and horizontal pelage divisions, is characteristic. Associated plant symr bols increase in number and variety. They are attached to the body outlines, added as a decorative band in the pelage division, and substi tuted for the tongue. These stylistic changes may be considered amplification of the existing conventions.4 Variant 2 (fig. 28) There is a single example of this variant of Spotted Cats in Phase 4? Note the amplification of the trilobate head format. Variant 5 (figs. 29-33) This variant appears to have developed in Phase 4? Although these portrayals recall Variant 1 in general shape and posture, their appearance is distinctive. The most conspicuous departures from the established stylistic conventions are the absence of a mouth mask and the presence of face painting. The trilobate head format, which is made up of the crown of the head flanked by ears, is generally retained, but the whole composition now rests on a horizontal bar representing the forehead. Pendent from the lower margin of this bar are the semicircu lar or triangular eyes. The presence of nostrils and the fact that the</page><page sequence="5">5 chin and mouth are not obscured by a whiskerlike mouth mask make the head of these beings appear humanlike. A closer examination of the other iconographie elements reveals, nevertheless, that we are still dealing with bona fide cats. The trilobate head format is often flanked by vegetables, most frequently capsicum peppers, which are highly remi niscent, at least in these depictions, of the whisker element of the mouth mask (figs. 29?31 )? The facial contours also show a lateral spike on either side which serves to support these fruits. A similar spike occasionally protrudes from each side of the chin (fig. 29)? The facial contour may be interpreted as a highly abstract form of the mouth mask. Sometimes obscuring this convention is the application of other fruits, for example maize ears, which are less reminiscent of the whisker ele ment than are capsicum peppers (figs. 32, 33)? Face painting is most prominent around the eyes, less frequent on the chin. The body of Variant 3 felines is usually angular and heavy. It is composed of at least three horizontal pelage divisions of which the topmost displays the natural cat markings, the next down is fre quently decorated with a plaited design of unknown significance (figs. 29, 31-33), and the lower division(s) is left fairly light-colored and inconspicuous. A large proportion of the Variant 3 cats have clawed thumbs on the front paws (figs. 29-31-33)? The legs are always striped, as is the tail, which is a direct continuation of the topmost pelage division of the body. Symbolic associations mostly include fruits which flank the head and may be attached to the contour of the animal or the extended tongue, or replace the trilobate head segment (fig. 29)? Nasca ? (figs. 34-55) Stylistic expression of this phase is divided into two distinct yet concurrent modes: the conservative and the radical.5 The former is a continuation of existing stylistic trends, the latter repre sents abrupt changes from the established conventions. Spotted Cat depictions appear in both stylistic modes. The conservative and radi cal stylistic sequences will be discussed separately, beginning with the conservative. Conservative mode Variant J[ (figs. 34-35) These cats bear an increasing number of symbolic elements which sometimes replace realistic, physical parts of the animal. Fruits in varying number are attached to the contour of all specimens observed, and may decorate the pelage division just below the spots. Fruits may also substitute for the tongue and the tip of the tail. More advanced representations indicate the nostrils and have a mouth mask that com pletely encloses the mouth. Mouth masks may also be embellished with arrangements of three marks, usually short lines or dots, suggesting little faces (fig? 35), a convention which appears as far back as Nasca 3 (fig. 15)? The trend towards straighter body outlines, especially on the lower body contour continues in all Phase 5 variants. Conservative mode Variant ,2 (figs. 36?38)</page><page sequence="6">6 Variant 2 Spotted Cats are distinguished in this phase by the frequent absence of the trilobate head piece (figs. 37, 38)? The mouth masks are highly conventionalized, no longer reminiscent of natural whiskers, and always close around the mouth. Nostrils are marked on their surface. The opening for the mouth diminishes in size. Some masks are also embellished by little three-mark faces. The tongue is characteristically represented as a capsicum pepper. Vegetable symbols predominate in these depictions, surrounding the contour and forming the tip of the tail. The tail is often composed of two longitudinal sec tions in continuation of the lower and upper pelage divisions (figs. 36 38) . This type of tail normally loses the natural markings. The upper division of the body bears very stylized, linear pelage markings (figs. 36, 37)? A breechcloth appears, placed between the hind legs (fig. 37)? Body contours are quite straight. Conservative mode Variant ? (figs. 39, 40) These cats continue the stylistic trend established for them in Phase 4? The tail is prominently striped as are the limbs. Pelage markings diminish in size and may form a linear trident pattern (fig. 39) ? The body contours are now generally straight. Association with cultivated plants may be very pronounced (fig. 40). Salient features of the sequence Since beyond Phase 5 the Spotted Cat theme shows no true con tinuity, it is well to review the characteristics of its sequential development before turning to the discussion of more radical variations of the theme. Prom a naturalistic prototype portrayed in Phase 1 emerged three distinct depictive variants. Distinct these portrayals may be, but there is little doubt that all represent the same being, a spotted, striped wild cat, which incongruously becomes associated with cultivated plants. Through the sequence one may observe the transition from the naturalistic prototype of a wild carnivore with bared teeth and jagged claws toward the docile mythical feline with softly rounded paws and hidden teeth together with the increasing symbolic association with cul tivated fruits accompanying the physical transition. It is noteworthy that the plant symbols progressively intrude and substitute for realis tic physical parts of the animal as well as surrounding it. The lack of emphasis on trophy heads, otherwise so important in Nasca iconography, further underlines these enigmatic mythical qualities. The theme is identified and distinguished from others in the style by prominent phys ical features of the being: feline head, body, pelage markings composed of spots and stripes, to which combination well-defined mythical quali ties were added gradually in the form of cultivated fruits. Variation in the portrayals is caused chiefly by traits that are optional, the presence or absence of which would neither identify nor obscure the theme. Such are the mouth mask and face painting (traits which, with a single exception,6 are mutually exclusive in this theme), extended tongue, orientation of head and limbs, mode of depicting the tail, breechcloth, and so on. Some elaborations seem incidental to the theme;</page><page sequence="7">7 examples include those called amplification in the discussion of Variant 1 (multiplication of eyebrows and horizontal pelage divisions) and the addition of little faces formed of three dots or dashes. Certain changes progress from Phases 2 to 5 and can thus be easily summarized. There is a tendency to increasing angularity in body shape following the rather naturally curved back and belly lines of Phase 2 and terminating in the boxy forms with straight back and belly found in Phase 5? Likewise the position of the tail, rather naturally and gently upcurved in Nasca 2, changes to curve more sharply over the back in Phases 3 and 4 and in Phase 5 often assumes a V-shaped curve with the tip pointing straight up. Pelage markings which are relatively long in Phase 2 become proportionately broader and crescentic in Phase 3, markedly tulip-shaped in Nasca 4, and most unnaturally thin and trident shaped in Phase 5? In no case should any single element be considered sufficient for attribution of a particular representation to a given phase, since there aire both advanced and conservative representations, but the trends are definitely present. Radical changes beginning in Nasca ? (figs. 41-59) The most frequently noted characteristic of the radical stylis tic mode is the introduction of rays and hair hanks. In the case of the Spotted Cat sequence, however, such elements are rather insignificant and occur relatively rarely. More important are the abrupt stylistic changes which result from experimentation and bizarre innovations (figs. 41-59)? Such changes include the mixture of features from previously well-delineated stylistic variants (e.g., combination of Variants 1 and 3, fig. 41 )&gt; the substitution of alien limbs for feline ones (figs. 42, 43), extra legs (figs. 44* 45), oversimplification of designs (figs. 46 48), abbreviation of depictions (fig. 49), proliferation of symbols (figs. 5O-52, 57-59) including the replacement by fruit of the trilobate head format (figs. 42, 44, 47, 49) and the increasing use of three-mark faces (figs. 45, 47)? There are also abrupt changes in symbolic associ ations, for example panels of fishes (fig. 53) or small quadrupeds (figs. 54, 57), a band of human faces (figs. 52, 54, 57, 58), a forehead orna ment not usually associated with felines (figs. 41, 51, 54), a breech cloth transfoimed into a trophy head (figs. 42, 50, 52, 53, 55), and direct association with trophy heads in Nasca 6 and 7 (figs. 56, 59b). Many of the Spotted Cat depictions now occupy design fields divided into registers (figs. 52-54, 56-59)? Moreover many of the sty listically radical designs appear on newly introduced vessel shapes. The changes in the symbolic associations of the being who was once ex clusively connected with cultivated plants signals altered mythical qualities, while its relegation on some vessels to a status of companion design (figs. 53, 54, 56, 57), in contrast to its previous position as principal motif, suggests loss of rank within the mythical hierarchy. Above all, the fact that these highly individualistic and divergent renderings can no longer be grouped into standardized variants heralds the disintegration of the thematic sequence, although the Spotted Cat is still to be found in recognizable form at least into Phase 7 (fig* 59)?</page><page sequence="8">8 Sequential Development of the Horrible Bird Theme Antecedents Unlike the Spotted Cat, the Horrible Bird does not have pre decessors before the Nasca sequence. The earliest known representations of the being are found in Phase 3? These examples already exhibit fairly advanced stylistic conventions. It is reasonable to suggest, by analogy with the Spotted Cat, that earlier, more realistically conceived representations existed. Physical characteristics, as well as the asso ciation with human body parts, strongly suggest that the mythical figure developed from a naturalistic carrion-eating bird, probably a condor,7 a bird frequently depicted on early Nasca vessels (figs. 62-65) and on south coast textiles. These realistic images bespeak keen observation of the physical properties and habits of the species. The physical characteristics of these birds most emphasized are the white-tipped beak, the caruncle, the curving neck and distended crop, large white markings on the shoulder portion of the dark wings, and weak talons. Note, how ever, that female Andean condors lack the caruncle (fig. 60; compare to male in fig. 6l). Nasca ? (figs* 66-68) The earliest known rendering of the Horrible Bird (fig. 66) on a double-spout-and-bridge vessel is conventionalized yet fairly realis tic anatomical details and proportions were retained. The beak and tal ons indicate a carrion eater, an impression more than amply reinforced by the presence of a human am and hand as well as a windpipe and lungs held in the beak,8 while the distended crop recalls the condor represen tations. Nonrealistic elements of the depiction are the Spondylus shell necklace, upstanding plume head ornajnent, and eye marking. The body and tail are decorated with trophy head motifs, while the ends of the feath ers bear little three-dot faces. Although this representation does not have a white beak tip as do the other Horrible Bird representations, the black and white photographs upon which my description is based appear to show a lighter tip. A second early example of the being is taken from the design of a conservative Phase 3 textile sampler and is included here to demon strate that the preceding version is not unique (fig. 67).9 This bird holds a trophy head in its beak and is decorated with trophy heads on the wing and tail, although it lacks other nonrealistic ornamentation. One further depiction, which probably belongs to the same phase, is decorated with trophy heads on the wing and tail and holds a stylized lung^-windpipe in its beak (fig. 68). This version has a cor&gt; ventionalized, bilaterally symmetrical head format which emphasizes the caruncle, foreshadowing developments in Phase 4? Nasca ? (figs. 69-75) Representation of the Horrible Bird on Nasca ceramics is very frequent in this phase permitting a detailed study of stylistic variation</page><page sequence="9">9 and sequential change. All depictions are standing, in profile, and display relatively realistic body details* The realism is occasionally upset by the replacement of talons by human feet (fig. 69)? The long, curving neck is often shortened (figs. 69, 71-74), but the distended crop is only rarely absent (fig. 71)? The most persistent trait is the prominently indicated white tip of the otherwise dark-colored beak. The most important stylistic change seems to be in the por trayal of the head. All heads in this phase tend to bilateral symmetry, but while some are rendered in a realistic fashion (figs. 69-71), others are modified in nonnatural ways (figs. 72-75)? The latter entail the gradual distortion of the natural caruncle which, if realistically drawn, should be seen above the beak. The contour not only becomes exaggerated, but is mirrored about an imaginary axis through the eye. More advanced versions also depict the head horizontally divided above the eye (figs. 75-75)? In such cases the crown of the head may contain an internal area which is sometimes filled with dots. The two modes of portrayal just described are forerunners of Variant 1 and Variant 2 birds respectively. A further nonrealistic stylistic elaboration found on most Phase 4 Horrible Bird depictions is the application of a serrated edge to the back of the being which invariably corresponds to the upper edge of the wing. We shall call this embellishment the mythical wingborder.^ Less frequent, but equally fictitious, are bristles on the beak (figs. 69, 72, 73, 75)? Eye marking becomes a standard trait in this phase (figs. 69-75)? The marking may be either positive, painted in a dark color on a lighter ground, or negative, with the area outside the mark darker. Feathers now not only bear little dot faces, but terminate in a point like a tongue, thus suggesting snakes. We call such feathers "snake feathers." ^' Ornamentation of other parts of the body, tail, thighs, crop and caruncle with faces also occurs very frequently. Such marking is most prominent, and always present, on the wing where the white band of plumage is located on natural condors. The nature of these faces is made more explicit by showing the two splinters that held the lips of the trophy head together (figs. 69, 72, 73). All Horrible Bird portrayals are shown with either a trophy head or a windpipe-lung combination in the beak. The head of the Horrible Bird may appear alone as an abbreviation (fig. 75)? Nasca ? (figs. 76-112) In this phase the Horrible Bird is portrayed in both conserva tive and radical modes. The former, characterized by gradual changes of the design, is the continuation of the already existing conventions. Radical stylistic changes in the Horrible Bird depictions not only resul ted in more extreme modification of the established traits, but the inno vative spirit also contributed to the emergence of several new depictive variants. Despite the divergent style of the portrayals, all variants can be successfully ordered and readily identified with the Horrible Bird. Many of the designs which were painted in the radical mode are associated with radically new vessel shapes.</page><page sequence="10">10 The proportion of radical depictions of the Horrible Bird cornr pared to conservative renderings is very small. A special effort was necessary to bring together a corpus sufficiently large to make the sty listic analysis meaningful. Material from later Nasca phases was not adequately surveyed, but there are indications that the importance of the Horrible Bird may have been largely eclipsed by other mythical be ings. In the following analysis conservative and radical stylistic renderings of the Horrible Bird will be discussed jointly when appropriate? Variant 1 (figs. 76-88) These birds are depicted in a form which is a direct continua tion of the earlier developments, with the bird's head basically bilat erally symmetrical. This type of depiction is by far the most popular in Phase 5? Stylistic changes consist chiefly of amplification of traits. The head is now always divided horizontally, forming well de fined upper and lower parts. The top corresponds to the crown of the head, and is decorated with an internal area which may contain dots or dashes (figs. 76-8O, 88), small faces (figs. 81, 86, 87), or the top of the head may be a trophy head, either complete (figs. 84, 85) or abbre viated (fig. 83). The imaginary vertical axis of bilateral symmetry is now explicitly shown on many depictions (figs. 76-83, 85, 86, 88). Pro jections of the facial contour and a distorted and reiterated caruncle are usually marked to suggest little faces, as are the base of the tail (figs. 76, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 87), the distended crop (figs. 77, 80-82, 83, 86), thighs (fig. 77), and the newly introduced breechcloth (figs. 76, 78, 83, 85, 87, 88). Peathers are commonly fashioned as snake feathers and in some cases the same treatment is applied to the disten ded crop (figs. 77, 80, 81)? The beak, while remaining conspicuously white-tipped, is subject to nonnatural modifications: bristles (figs. 77, 80, 88), hairhanks (figs. 77, 79, 82, 85, 87), doubling (figs. 77, 86), or total omission (figs. 78, 81). It may also be curved (figs. 76, 79)? The distended crop may also be doubled (fig. 82). The division between the wing and tail feathers diminishes and there may be feathers below the tail, emerging from the legs (figs. 76-78, 85, 87)? This treatment is most common on birds that have human legs and wear a breechcloth. The body may be unusually long and slender. Eye marking is less popular in this phase; only a few Variant 1 birds are still so decorated. The wing is always outlined with a mythical wing border. Decoration of the wing with trophy heads is very prominent. All of these birds carry (or are consuming) a trophy head (figs. 80, 82-84, 86, 87), a windpipe-lung combination (figs. 78, 79, 81 ), or a combination of these elements (figs. 76, 77, 85)? Among Variant 1 birds about half bear only a trophy head, while the other half bear either a simple windpipe-lung combination or such a combination combined with a trophy head. Variant 1 birds may be depicted in the radical made and as such are distinguished from their conservative counterparts only by the degree of amplification of already existing features and the addition of a few unusual or bizarre traits. Sporadic occurrence of such elements as</page><page sequence="11">11 recurved rays (figs. 83, 86) and hair hanks (figs. 77-79, 81 , 82, 85, 87) indicates the radical mode, as do exaggerated design components (fig. 88) or a bizarre arrangement of body parts (fig. 87). One of these figures is also associated with a snake (fig. 88, see also fig. 74)? Variant 2 (figs. 89-94) This variant consists of birds probably developed from the Phase 4 antecedents which retained a realistic head profile. Neverthe less, stylistic change led to appreciable differences in the new portrayals. The most interesting feature of these renderings is their relative simplicity. The head, body and tail are usually integrated into a single oval unit to which the beak, tail, and legs are attached The head is always decorated with eye markings. The beak has a promi nent white tip. The feet are stylized bird claws usually attached to the body by lobes that bear semicircular decoration (abbreviated trophy head?) pendent from the body contour. This variant omits the crop from the depiction and the wing no longer covers the upper portion of the body but is lifted and rests upon it. The front of the wing profile is curved and a mythical wingborder follows the new contour. The wing, body and tail are filled with stylized but prominent trophy heads. The feathers of the wing are always rendered as snake feathers. Tail feath ers are sometimes attached to the wing feathers at a more or less right angle and in such cases the tail feathers are straight ended (figs. 91 93, compare 79)? Each bird carries a stylized trophy head in the beak. No other body parts were observed in this position. Variant 2 bird designs usually appear on radically new vessel forms. Some depictions display bizarre traits such as the inclusion of extraneous body parts (fig. 94)? Since these designs differ consistently from their Phase 4 antecedents, it is justifiable to regard the entire group as a stylistically radical sequence. Variant 5 (figs. 95-103) This variant represents an interesting departure from other conventionalized forms being portrayed with a circular head inside of which concentric circles form the eye. Although the head treatment appears to be a novelty in the sequence, it is actually based on the naturalistic portrayal of the carrion eaters (compare to figs. 62, 64, 65)? A white-tipped beak completes the head. In contrast to the simple, naturalistic head, most other details of this version are very conven tionalized. The body is either narrow and sticklike (figs. 100, 101) or, more commonly, T-shaped with the crossbar of the at the tail (figs. 95-99, 102). In either case the body is disproportionately small com pared to the rest of the anatomy. Like Variant 2 birds, Variant 3 ones have wings resting on top of the body rising higher than the head. The wing has a curved or angular contour with a mythical wingborder. The tail feathers are straight ended and usually snake feathers. Some depictions, however, have no tail feathers (figs. 100, 101), one bearing what appears to be a mammalian tail (fig. 101), while another (fig. 98) appears to have a second tail. The legs are apparently human while the feet may be either human or hoofed (figs. 96, 97)? Most Variant 3</page><page sequence="12">12 Horrible Birds seem to be walking or running. There is -usually a breech cloth between the legs. These birds never display a distended crop or emphasize the presence of a caruncle, although it is often suggested. Several depictions are shown with extra legs attached to the outline of the body in a bizarre arrangement (figs. 95, 97)? On one vessel the bird has its wing attached backward (fig. 97)? A further unusual feature of this variant is the presence of a bifurcate element held in the beak. While in one case it is contained within the beak (fig. 96), it usually emerges from the beak and is recurved at the ends (figs. 95, 97, 98, 102, IO3). This element is some times shown as snakes which curve in the same fashion (figs. 100, 101) and in one case result in the beak being recurved (fig. ), while in one specimen a single snake emerges from the beak (fig. 99)? Bifurcate snakes emerge from the head of another specimen (fig. 102). The signi ficance of this association is unknown, although the sporadic occurrence of snakes with other Horrible Bird depictions has been noted (figs. 74, 88, 94, 107). Variant 3 birds never hold trophy heads or body parts in the beak, but several of them have a human arm and hand which holds a trophy head (figs. 95, 96, 98, IO3) or in one case a club (fig. 99)? A second aim may also be added (figs. 95, 98, 99) which sometimes contains proli ferous elements (figs. 98, 99)? In addition to any trophy head it may hold, each bird has a prominent trophy head decoration on the wing and most also have a trophy head on the tail portion (figs. 95-97, 99, 102) and some on the breechcloth (figs. 96, 98). In no case is the body wide enough to be decorated. The addition of such proliferous elements as recurved rays or hair hanks is not common (97, 103)? Variant 3 Horrible Bird depictions are rather rare and most commonly found represented on single spout bottles with a bridge to a modeled human head (for example figs. 95, 96, 103),^ where they fre quently decorate the figure1s mantle. These designs are a stylistically radical development with most of the depictions displaying some innovative, bizarre or proliferous features. Variant 4 (figs. IO4-IO8) These birds have a rectangular head, most often joined to a rectangular body. The angularity is softened somewhat by the addition of a tail with curved contours. Anatomical details, as well as the arrangement of body parts are inconsistent and unnatural. For example, wings may be attached directly to the head (figs. 105, IO6) and their feathers are oriented in more than one direction (figs. 104-108). Be spite such bizarre renderings, each bird has a well formed beak with a white tip and has realistic bird feet with claws. Flight is sugges ted by the position of the feet which are limp, gently curving and par allel to the beak, in contrast to the powerful stride of the Variant 3 birds. The boxy head is decorated with an equally box-shaped eye mar king. Vestiges of the mythical wingborder indicate the wing location. The body is reduced to the trophy head which, in other variants forms the base of the tail, and the wing also has a prominent trophy head</page><page sequence="13">13 decoration. The "bird also holds a trophy head in its beak. No other body parts were observed in this variant. The plumage is usually repre sented as snake feathers which, in one case, have two tongues (fig* 106). Although these representations are rather simple, some additional, non realistic elaborations occur. The beak may be doubled (fig. 106) or covered with bristle (fig. 107), and a snakelike element emerges from the head of one example (fig. 107). Variant 4 birds are infrequent and restricted to Nasca Phase 5? Although few proliferous elements were observed, the unique design con cept and bizarre composition of this variant as well as its association with radical vessel shapes indicate that it also belongs to the radical stylistic mode. Variant 5 (figs. 109-112) In this variant the birds are portrayed with outspread wings, representing the only full view depictions of the Horrible Bird. The head, however, is shown in profile and is disproportionately large. In some cases the body is reduced as in the Variant 4 birds to the trophy head tail base (figs. IO9, HO). When the body is included it is con ceived in much the same way as that of Variant 2 birds (figs. 111, 112). The tail and wings are composed of snake feathers. A mythical wing border not only frames the outer edge of the outspread wings, but may also decorate their inner edge (fig. 109). The wings and usually the tail are adorned with trophy heads. The legs of Variant 5 birds are much reduced or entirely eliminated and the legs or feet are attached directly to the wing. The feet may be represented as bird claws (fig. 112), humanlike (fig. 111), or other less definable forms (figs. IO9, 110). All known Variant 5 birds hold a trophy head in the beak. No association with other body parts or with other symbols was observed. These depictions begin in Phase 5 and are often associated with new vessel shapes (figs. 111, 112). Since this form of portrayal also represents an abrupt departure from the conventions established in Phase 4, Variant 5 birds are considered to be a radical stylistic development. Salient features of the sequence Despite a rather divergent development from a single ancestral prototype, the Horrible Bird emerges as a mythical being of well-defined qualities. Traits essential to its physical make-up are the basically avian characteristics accentuated by the attributes of carrion eaters* The hallmark of the sequence is, undoubtedly, the presence of conspic uously displayed white tips on heavy, dark-colored beaks, a trait which is not shared with any other being in Nasca iconography. Another important physical feature of condors is the caruncle which, however^ characterizes only the male of the species; therefore it may not be always present in the depictions. Another prominent trait is the dis tended crop which, since it is only discernable when the bird is in certain positions or when it is gorged, may also be realistically omit ted from the picture. The most persistent embellishment of the sequence</page><page sequence="14">14 is the decoration with trophy head motifs* All depictions bear trophy head(s) on the wing, applied where there is naturally a band of white feathers* This position is analogous to the natural pelage division of the Spotted Cat which is frequently decorated with fruit symbols. Less consistently other parts of the bird (body, tail, thighs, crop, neck, head) may also be embellished with trophy heads. The association of the being with carrion is clear from numer ous earlier portrayals; it is therefore significant that only human body parts are explicitly shown. Even the naturalistic condors of Nasca 2 and 3 ceramics peck a human head or limbs. Our earliest example of the Horrible Bird in the sequence, is shown holding a human arm and hand along with the windpipe and lungs. Variant 1 birds, which developed stylistically in Phase 4 and persist to the end of the sequence, are portrayed with a human head or windpipe-lung combination or both in their beak. All other types, which first appear in Phase 5* are associ ated only with trophy heads and never with other body parts* This statement includes the somewhat deviant Variant 3 birds with a bifurcate element replacing the trophy head in the beak, since various examples of this variant grasp trophy heads in an appended human hand* The lack of archaeological context for the sample studied prevents a check on the seriation, but there is a clear ordering of the depictive variants from 1, which represents the most explicit represen tation of carrion eating, to 5* which is a more symbolic representation* Variant 1 is the most conservative since it most closely resembles the Nasca 1 naturalistic condor representations* The extent to which the stylistic variants may reflect temporal differences remains to be determined* There are also several persistent optional and marginal traits* The presence of nonavian legs, of eye marking, a breechcloth, and bris tles on the beak seem to have remained optional throughout the sequence* The presence of a mythical wingborder, snake feathers, or the decoration of design elements with three marks suggesting little faces may be considered as marginal elaborations* Extremely radical transformation of the design elements destroy the representational qualities of the theme* The importance of the Horrible Bird seems to decline following Nasca 5? Variations on the Avian Theme Nasca decorative themes include many birds, some realistic and others mythical* There are certain birds with traits similar to those of the Horrible Bird* It seems warranted to investigate the possibility that these birds may be variations on the same theme* Not-so-horrible Birds (figs. 113-122) This category comprises a group of representations which differ significantly from the Horrible Bird, although they also share certain</page><page sequence="15">15 attributes. As the condor is the natural counterpart of the mythical Horrible Bird, there are natural counterparts of the Not-so-horrible Birds (figs. 114a, 118, 119). These natural birds differ from the con dor in having small, pointed beaks lacking a white tip, speckled feath ers, or a crested neck. The mythical Not-so-horrible Birds differ from the Horrible Bird theme in also lacking the white-tipped beak or any association with human body parts other than trophy heads, although they may be associated with snakes (fig. 120). Not-so-horrible Birds resemr ble the Horrible Bird, however, in that they are also depicted with trophy head decoration on the wing (figs. 113, 114b, 115, 117, 121, 122) or with similar symbolic association; and they have a mythical wingborder (figs. 113, 114b-117, 120-122). On the basis of mythical qualities and physical attributes, the Not-so-horrible Birds may safely be regarded as independent mythical themes, probably representing at least two separate creatures on the basis of consistent physical differences. Harpies 15 (figs. 123-135) This very distinctive group of mythical beings is character ized by a humanlike head and avian body. These beings first appear on Nasca vessels in Phase 4 and remain an important decorative theme throughout Phase 5? Not unlike the Horrible Bird, Harpies are usually decorated with trophy heads on the wing and to a lesser extent, on the tail. The rendering of body and limbs follows a stylistic development analogous to that of Variant 1 Horrible Birds, especially those with anthropomorphic legs. The distribution of talons and human feet on Harpies seems random. The separation between wing and tail feathers may diminish, as in the case of the Horrible Bird, and the feathers may ex tend below the tail, growing out of the leg (figs. 127, 128). A breech cloth may also be present on the renderings which have human legs (figs. 127-129). Some Harpies also exhibit a distended crop (figs. 127, 128). With a single exception (fig. 125), these beings are decorated with a mythical wingborder. There is some variation in the representation of Harpy feathers, ranging from the naturalistic portrayal of fig. 125 through transformation into hair hanks (figs. 126, 128, I32) and the inclusion of simple three-dot faces (fig. 13?) to snake feathers, which is the most common form (figs. 123, 124, 127, 129, 131, 133-135)? Despite apparent iconographie similarities between Variant 1 Horrible Birds and Harpies in the development of the body, wing, tail and legs, the rendering of Harpy heads not only remains human throughout the sequence, but also exhibits some consistent traits that are unique to the theme. Harpies are usually portrayed with a headdress of two to five lobes (figs. 123-131, 135) which may be conventionalized on more advanced depictions as a tall hat (figs. 132, 133) or turban (fig. 134)? The multilobate head arrangement is strongly reminiscent of the stylis tic development of the Spotted Cat yet the headdress does not incorpor ate the Harpy1 s ears which are usually clearly displayed on either side of the face. Rendering of the forehead as one or more horizontal bars; pendent semicircular or triangular eyes, often decorated with eye mar king; occasional markings on the chin; the unmasked mouth and frequently</page><page sequence="16">16 extended tongue all recall the head of Variant 3 Spotted Cats. Harpy facial contours, however, never hear the spikelike protrusions which serve to support vegetable symbols on Variant 3 cats. No such protru sion is present on the lower part of the face either. A striking and distinctive feature of Harpy depictions is the presence of thick, black strands of hair that flank the face. The hair strands appear as massive columnar supports which are in the position of two front limbs. The salient physical characteristics which define these beings, then, are the combination of an avian body with a human head without a mask and flanked by long thick hair. Unlike Horrible Birds, some Harpy renderings lack the trophy head association (figs. 125 and perhaps 153) and may exhibit symbols not found in the Horrible Bird sequence, for example, the arrow or dart motif (fig. 130)? Always depicted with a human head, the Harpies contrast with the Horrible Bird theme, where the most prominent and distinguishing trait is the beak. While Harpies, like many other mythical beings in Nasca art, are decorated with trophy head motifs, there is no hint that they also ate carrion. The Harpies may be related to the Horrible Bird by stylistic conventions, but they seem to constitute an independent mythical theme. Iconography of Composition Conventions The following brief survey attempts to demonstrate the exist ence of a large repertoire of stylistic conventions which are superim posed on Nasca ceramic decoration. The presence of these devices brings about changes ranging from marginal and gradual to unusual and abrupt, affecting the style throughout in a remarkably unifonn fashion. Undoubt edly the cause of the variation usually goes beyond simple aesthetic consideration and carries complex esoteric significance. Nevertheless, since the religious belief and ritual practices of the Nasca culture are not known to us, the entire phenomenon will be considered here as a spe cial aspect of stylistic change. I shall identify and briefly describe only the most prominent composition conventions which affected the sty listic sequences of the Spotted Cat and Horrible Bird, while similar instances will be derived from other mythical themes to show the generalized nature of the phenomenon. Embellishments Decorative borders (figs. 136-155) A conspicuous stylistic device, decorative borders enhance the natural outline of many designs. Most commonly the decoration consists of rows of geometrical forms, especially serrations, spikes, scallops or rectangular blocks, which may be further accentuated with internal lines or by being filled with a solid dark color. Serrated borders were parti cularly popular in the first part of the Nasca sequence on elongated bodies or appendages (figs. I36, 137), although many other types of ren derings were similarly embellished, for example, the outline of the Spotted Cat (fig. 138), a nonrepresentational design (fig. 139), a radi cal depictive version of the Horrible Bird (fig. HO). A specialized</page><page sequence="17">17 form of this convention is the mythical wingborder which ornaments the Horrible Birds, Harpies and other mythical avians. Decorative borders are completely unrelated to the natural contours and a number of designs are employed. There may be symbols alternating with serrations (fig. Hi), alternating symbols (fig* 142), and repeated symbols other than serrations (darts, fig. 143; peppers, fig. 144)? This last tendency is exemplified by advanced Phase 5 Spotted Cats surrounded with stylized capsicum peppers (e.g., figs. 36, 37, 41, 43, 50-54)? There are also instances in the Nasca style when the artists apparently deliberately exploited projections occurring naturally on the design outline for the same aesthetic effect. Por example, irregulari ties of the manioc plant were conventionalized to resemble a serrated edge (fig. 145)? In the portrayal of the Master of Fishes,14 progres sive conventionalization results in a decorative border formed of rows of fins alternating with feet or hands (figs. 146-150)? The most drama tic alteration of natural contours, however, results from radical changes when the design is partially or totally obscured (figs. I5I, 152)? Decorative borders were consciously used devices which also foraied independent themes (figs. 153-155)? Minor decorative elaborations Examples of such elaboration include the modification of feathers by applying three marks to suggest little faces and the appli cation to these of an extended tongue to suggest snakes. These devices were introduced in Phase 3 and promptly became standard treatment on most feathered beings in the Nasca style. In Phase 5 the rounded end of feathers is sometimes squared. The suggestion of faces through a. config ur?t ion of three marks is not restricted to feathers but may also be observed on mouth masks, forehead ornaments, or inside almost any curved or triangular contour. Formats The serpentine format (figs. 157-170) This format probably originated in the snakelike appendages that embellish mythical beings in the Paracas style and, most commonly, in the first three phases of the Nasca sequence (fig. 156). Detached from the main figure, serpentines appear as independent themes at least as ?arly as Nasca 2 (figs. 157-159)? As noted earlier, the serpentine forms are usually accentuated with a dark, serrated border which led Seler to call these designs "Zackenschlange." 15 Bather than represen ting one specific "Zackenschl?nge," however, these renderings may be viewed as the imposition of the serpentine format upon various mythical beings who often retain certain identifying characteristics of their genre. Thus, images of the Spotted Cat (I6O-I62), an assortment of anthropomorphic beings (figs. 163-164), the Master of Fishes (figs. I48, 151) and other, yet unnamed mythical beings (figs. I65-I68, I70) may be included among the serpentine examples. Variants of this format include rare representations showing vestiges of hind legs and tail (fig. 144),</page><page sequence="18">18 and, more frequently, two-headed renderings (figs. 157, 160, 165)? The. serpentine may also occur as an independent motif (fig. 169) ? The signifer format (figs* 172-185) The signifer also derives from serpentine appendages, but in stead of becoming detached, the serpentine becomes a streamer and remains an integral and increasingly important component of the depiction. It is possible to follow this transition in the iconography of selected exam ples from Phase 2 through 5 (figs. 171-179)? The form and purpose of the signifer were well described by Roark, who first applied the term to this device.1^ The signifer element is commonly associated with a parti cular anthropomorphic being holding a club (figs. I4I, 142, 173-176, 178). The ingenious identification device was, nevertheless, exploit ed by the artists in depictions of other beings whose original fom was drastically altered to fit this peculiar convention. Zoomorphic beings were provided with a human body. For example, the Spotted Cat is ren dered with human body and limbs, brandishing a club, reminiscent of its anthropomorphic counterpart, yet the face retains its feline character and the association with cultivated plant symbols is carefully included for proper identification (fig. 177)? A figure from a Phase 3 textile sampler even more clearly underlines the mythical identity of the Spot ted Cat, notwithstanding the signifer format (fig. 172). The wing of profile mythical avians may be transformed into a signifer as occurs on Harpy depictions (fig. 179)? In the case of beings with a fishlike body, the body is converted into a signifer and a human body is added beneath. This treatment is exemplified by the transformations, in Phases .6 and 7, of Bloody Mouth, a variant of the Master of Fishes 17 (figs. 180-182). Signifers appear in Phase 3 and reach their apogee in Phase 5? The design format became very standardized through repetition (figs. I4I, 142, 173-178). As the radical changes occurred the signifer format be came less regular (figs. 183, 184). With the proliferation of design elements, the signifer sometimes lost its identifying function and reverted to the original role as a flowing appendage (fig. 185). The animal emblem format (figs. 186-200) This format probably originated from animal skin headdresses (fig. 186) which through stylistic change became a conventional format similar to the signifer. Although Roark included this format among the signifers it does not fit his definition of a signifer and differs in various ways from that element.18 The most important difference is that while the primary function of the signifer is to carry abstract symbols which may represent more than one mythical aspect of the being, the ani mal emblem portrays a natural or mythical animal often including the head, which is depicted on the side of the main figure's head opposite the body of the animal (figs. 188, 192, 194? 195)? The animals which form animal emblems also appear as independent themes in the Nasca repertoire. Our sample includes the fox (fig. 187), perhaps the most frequently used ani mal in this convention (figs. I88-I90); two kinds of Not-so-horrible Bird (crested, fig. 192 compare I9I, and speckled, figs. 194, 195</page><page sequence="19">19 compare 193); hummingbird (figs. 196, 197); the crayfish (figs. 198, 199) and the Spotted Cat (fig. 200 compare 15-23). Of all these representa tions, only the Not-so-horrible Birds are clearly mythical in nature, but the fox and Spotted Cat may also be intended as mythical representa tives of those species. The trophy-head taster format Most mythical beings, with the possible exception of birds with a beak, are sometimes depicted with the tongue extended. This fea ture was mentioned with reference to the Spotted Cat and Harpies. The tongue is often subject to imaginative elaborations, the most common of which is its transformation into a symbol. The Spotted Cat sequence provides many examples of this treatment, but the phenomenon may be ob served in various other beings (figs. 201-204)? More extravagant trans formations include the extrusion from the mouth of mythical beings (fig. 205), serpents (fig. 206) or even entire processions (figs. 207, 208). The extended tongue may, like a signifer, contain symbolic elements re ferring to the mythical nature of the being in question (fig* 209). Radical changes render it proliferous (fig. 210) or employ it to link repeated proliferous elements (fig. 211)? The trophy-head taster format (figs* 212-218) represents a complex figurative expression which may be regarded as a special class of the extended tongue gesture. The being is usually shown in a spread eagle position, with the wings and tail of a bird, human or avian legs flanking the tail and frequently with human aims and hands holding a trophy head by the hair* The tip of a long extended tongue touches the trophy head. The being often wears a characteristic mouth mask with up curving, whiskerlike lateral elements (figs. 212, 213), but apparently this is an optional feature. In Nasca 5 the mouth mask may have appended recurved ray elements (fig. 217). Horrible Bird trophy-head tasters, of course, have no mouth mask (figs. 214-216); the Horrible Bird never has a mouth mask* The trophy head may be replaced by internal body parts (fig. 218; compare figs* 72 and 73 derived from more realistic examples like 68 and 69)? The feathers of the outspread wings are often fash ioned from a row of trophy heads with long hair (figs. 212-215, 217, 218)* The tails may be composed of snake feathers (fig. 216), simple feathers with three-dot faces (figs* 215, 217), unmarked vertical or horizontal feathers (figs. 214, 218). or horizontal zig-zag bands to resemble a hawk tail (figs. 212, 213). This intriguing composition does not represent a distinct myth ical being; rather many distinct mythical personages of the Nasca cosmology are portrayed in this peculiar format. Among these is the Spotted Cat (fig. 212), Horrible Bird (figs. 214-216) and various anthro pomorphic figures (figs. 213, 217, 218). Depictions of the Horrible Bird in this convention recall Variant 5 depictions. The distinction between a bona fide trophy-head taster and Variant 5 birds is in the treatment of the wing feathers (the use of trophy heads to foim the wing is ob served only on trophy-head tasters), the depiction of tail feathers (only trophy-head tasters have horizontal feathers), shape and position of the legs (trophy-head tasters1 legs are porportional to their body</page><page sequence="20">20 size and flank the outspread tail while Variant 5 Horrible Bird legs are reduced and the almost legless feet are fused with the wing). The impor tance of this enigmatic format in the style is further underlined by its occurrence on textiles and in other art media. Adornments Forehead ornaments (figs. 220-228) Apparently continuing the tradition already present in the Paracas style (fig. 219), forehead ornaments enjoyed considerable popu larity during the Nasca sequence. The dominant form of forehead orna ment is a golden band with a central ornament that suggests plumes. This ornament is a standard part of the paraphernalia of certain Nasca anthropomorphic beings, and its frequent and continuous depictions led to conventionalization (figs. 220-225). In Nasca 5 (figs. 220, 221) the outer elements of the upstand ing central portion curve out and down, to touch the base of the design in Nasca 4? In Phase 4 (figs. 222-224; the center elements are shortened while the flanking elements form tight curls. Changes in the ornament itself are accompanied by regular changes in its background. Phase 3 forehead ornaments have a black background which is changed to light colored bands that may be decorated in Phase 4 examples (figs. 222, 223)? The background of advanced Phase 4 forehead ornaments (fig. 224) usually includes an outline of the center element and another outline which in corporates two earlike elements. In Phase 5 (fig* 225) the internal out line of Phase 4 is omitted. Radical changes result in irregular, very proliferous designs which are no longer consistent (fig. 226).19 Pore head ornaments may also be associated with nonanthropomorphic beings. Por example, some representations of the Spotted Cat bear one (figs* 41, 51, 54) and it may also be seen on Bloody Mouth as the Master of Pishes (fig. 227)? Forehead ornaments also occur on trophy-head jars (fig. 228) and may be represented in various media other than ceramics. Plumes (figs. 229^231) Another type of ornament is also worn on the head, a tall up right stylized plume. This plume is sometimes combined with the forehead ornament (fig. 229) or may appear independently as on the earliest known depiction of the Horrible Bird (fig. 230). The same ornament may be discerned in a proliferous portrayal of Bloody Mouth (fig. 231 )? Mouth masks (figs. 220-227, 229, 231-237) This adornment was also popular throughout the Nasca style. The best known masked figures are the anthropomorphic beings (figs. 220 226, 229)? Constant repetition of these ornaments on the portraits led to conventions analogous to those of the forehead ornaments with which the masks occur. A significant change takes place in Phase 4 when the mask begins to form a closed arc around the mouth covering most of the lower face (compare figs. 232-234, 22 0 222 and 229 to 223-226). The aperture becomes progressively smaller and finally reveals only the lips.</page><page sequence="21">21 Nostrils, generally absent from the preceding depictions, appear marked directly on the surface of the mask. By and large the lateral elements of these masks are oriented horizontally, a tendency that becomes stan dardized in Phase 4? Conventions are consistently followed'in Phase 5 (fig. 226). The most obvious variation observed in this phase is in the shape of the lips or mouth opening which is curvilinear on conservative versions but forms a small rectangle on more advanced depictions. This sequence recalls the changes already noted in the mask of the Spotted Cat. I have already referred to a specialized mask form with curved ray side elements, which is found on some trophy-head taster depictions (figs. 212, 213, ?36). It appears that an analogous trend from an open to a closed mask also occurs in masks of this form. The mouth mask is often part of advanced depictions of Bloody Mouth as the Master of Fishes (fig. 227), where the ornament conforms to the characteristically gaping jaws of the being. This adaptation is even more pronounced in abbreviated versions of Bloody Mouth, where the mask itself becomes an expressive vehicle to emphasize frightening qualities of that being (fig. 231). While avians appear quite consistently without a mouth mask, the decoration seems optional in the case of some mythical themes as was observed in the Spotted Cat sequence. The ornament is very suscep tible to proliferation and achieves fantastic shapes in the process (figs. 226, 231, 237)? Examples of mouth masks have been found in archaeological context but their significance in Nasca culture is ob scure .20 Face painting (figs. 239-250) Painted face and eye decoration may occur on the depiction of almost every mythical being in the Nasca style. Although there is consi derable variation in coloring and design scheme, some forms are clearly favored over others. Painting around the eyes may be observed in associ ation with more mythical beings than all other forms of face painting combined, and by far the most popular design used to enhance this area is the eye marking of falcons, consciously copied from natural models (fig. 238)This design, in more or less naturalistic renditions, is found on Variant 3 Spotted Cats, all variants of the Horrible Bird except Variant 3 and on Harpies. Falcon eye markings are common on trophy-head vessels (figs. 228, 239, 240). The Masked Mythical Being also occasion ally bears such markings (figs. 201, 241)* constituting the only cases of co-occurrence of the mouth mask and eye markings except the one cat version noted earlier. Falcon eye markings are less common on modeled anthropomorphic representations (figs. 242, 243 J although fig. 242 may be an anthropomorphized falcon), where other designs are more common (figs. 244-249)? The falcon marking even occurs as an independent theme (fig. 250). Aside from the elaborate eye decoration noted on modeled rep resentations, other designs tend to be geometric, and in some cases may simply represent a fusion of the two lines of the falcon marking (figs.</page><page sequence="22">22 31, 39, 128, 150, 207)? Naturalistic designs as in figs. 246 and 249 are uncommon. In general those beings who are represented with eye markings may also be represented without them, but virtually all Variant 2, 4 and 5 Horrible Birds bear a version of the falcon marking and none bears any other sort of eye decoration. Decoration on other parts of the face, while less common than eye decoration, does occur. For example, chin decoration was observed on Variant 3 Spotted Cats and Harpies (figs. 29-31, 39, 131, 133)? Salient aspects of composition conventions Three classes of stylistic convention have been discussed above: widely occurring embellishments; standardized formats; and adorn ment with, presumably, prestige-related paraphernalia. The intrusion of these devices into specific thematic sequences resulted in effects rang ing from minor deviations to serious modification of the image. By altering separate themes in similar ways, these intrusions also contri buted to providing a veneer of general uniformity within the Nasca style. The importance of this phenomenon cannot be overstated with regard to the seriation of stylistic traits. Gradual and highly regular changes in the rendering of the forehead ornament and mouth mask provide a reliable guide to relative chronology. Many other features still wait to be ordered for the same purpose. Conclusion Stylistic sequences of the Spotted Cat and Horrible Bird respectively embrace a wide variety of depictions representing the same themes, ranging from conventional portraits deteimined mostly by the salient characteristics of the mythical beings, to eccentric images of the same, where alien, intrusive features predominate. Thus all por trayals of the Spotted Cat and Horrible Bird sequences may be viewed as the combination of two principal stylistic components: intrinsic and intrusive. The foimer not only defines the personality of the mythical being but, through a set of unique traits, sets the theme apart from all others in the style. Intrusive features, on the other hand, affect unrelated themes in a uniform fashion and tend to obscure distinctions by creating apparent similarities among distinct mythical beings. These conclusions must, however, be promptly qualified. My study was of limited scope, deliberately addressed to the investigation of stylistic change, as seen through two arbitrarily selected mythical themes. Although undoubtedly important as mythical personages, the Spotted Cat and Horrible Bird are not necessarily general models for the entire Nasca mythical hierarchy. Moreover, it is reasonable to suggest that both beings were of about the same mythical status. By focusing on these two themes I ignored the little explored but crucial factor of hierarchical differences. Another limitation of the study was temporal. The representations of both mythical beings are confined essentially to the first half of the Nasca sequence, and most depictions are in the representational, conservative tradition. The study represents an</page><page sequence="23">23 attempt to untangle a few of the many intermingled features of the Nasca style and follow these strands to their end. Ac knowledgements This study would have been impossible without the pioneering work of Lawrence E? Dawson in establishing the initial Nasca sequence and the further work of Roark and Proulx in refining phases 5-6. Dawson1s continuing work on the Nasca style on the interpretation of iconographie elements as well as on chronology has been invaluable to me even in cases where we did not agree. I cannot adequately thank him for his generosity in providing me with his knowledge and opinions as well as free access to his file of unpublished photographs; some of these were drawn and included here, but many more formed part of the data upon which this study is based. A work of this sort depends on access to a large number of spe cimens and recent additions to the corpus of published Nasca material by Eisleb and especially by Blasco and Ramos have contributed materially to this study. The extent to which I am indebted to these authors and others may be seen in the many specimens from their works that are illustrated here or referred to in the Key to Illustrations. The original version of this article is the result of a gradu ate research course taken during Spring, 1979, under the direction of John H. Rowe. His inspiration, guidance and encouragement is greatly responsible for my deep interest in Nasca iconography. I also wish to thank Patricia Lyon for her many good suggestions while turning my term paper into an article, her lengthy involvement with editing the text and illustrations and the many stimulating discussions which not only cleared up numerous vague points, but generated exciting new ones for future research. I wish to thank both John and Pat for a very interesting and worthwhile research experience. June 28, 1979 revised July 3, 1981 NOTES Seier described and named the mythical feline "die gefleckte Katze" (Seier, 1923, pp. 174-183)? This name, translated as "Spotted Cat" and "el gato manchado," has remained in use. The Horrible Bird was so named by Lawrence E. Bawson. Rowe (i960) gives the early history of Nasca research. He empha sizes the importance of relative chronology based chiefly on stylistic criteria, underlining the contributions of L.E. Bawson in establishing the stylistic sequence. The present study is based on the relative, stylistic sequence whose phases have been defined by Bawson, Proulx (i960; 1970), Roark (1965) and the author.</page><page sequence="24">24 3 The local wild cat as a possible naturalistic model for the mythi cal Spotted Cat of the Nasca sequence was suggested to me by Dawson. He was informed by inhabitants of the lea Valley that a small wild cat is still present in the area? The identification of the local south coast wild cat as the pampas cat was made by Patricia J# Lyon (ms.). Earlier authors identified the Spotted Cat as a river otter, "el gato de agua," claiming that cats were largely unknown on the Peruvian south coast (Valc?rcel, 1932, pp. 16?23)? In my opinion, the realistic and explicit catlike attributes of the early Nasca portrayals of the Spotted Cat ex clude the possibility that anything but a member of the cat family served as the model. Later depictions tend to be obscured by nonrealistic conventions. ^Amplification is a useful concept referring to a process of incre mentation along a given line of change, e.g., vessels become taller and taller, more and more colors are used, eyes become more and more elonga ted, more symbols are attached and so on. The process was recognized and named by L.E. Dawson. ^Aspects of the conservative (monumental) and radical (proliferous) modes of stylistic change were described by Rowe (i960) and a detailed study of the phenomenon was presented by Roark ( 19^5) ? g Lumbreras, 1974, flg. 137 top left, p. 129. 7 An excellent study of the Palconidae in ancient Peruvian art was presented by Yacovleff ( 1932b). He refers to a "general belief" that the condor ("Sarcoramnhus") is the naturalistic model for the Horrible Bird (p. 34), perhaps alluding to the work of Urteaga (1924, ? 13)? Unfortunately, Yacovleff himself rejected this conclusion on the grounds that, in many depictions, Nasca mythical birds appear with falcon eye markings. In the present study I have attempted to emphasize the arbi trary and optional nature of this stylistic elaboration, and based my interpretation on persistent physical traits that distinguish condors and the Horrible Bird from other birds. Q The body parts referred to were so identified by L.E. Dawson. 9 This design from a textile sampler was reconstructed from stitch holes and stains by Junius B. Bird (Bird, 1961, caption to fig. 3)? Stylistically the sampler is conservative Nasca 3? The same sampler also has representations of a naturalistic condor with a human leg in its beak (fig. 2-11). ^These stylistic elaborations were identified and named by Dawson. n The term "snake feather" was coined by Dawson. ? 13). 12 This is the vessel form called "Woman Form Bottle" by Roark (1965?

Bawson and is presented here with his kind permission. 20 Lothrop has discussed both representations and actual specimens of mouth masks as well as forehead ornaments and plumes (1937)? Many of his examples are in the Nasca style. 21 These markings and the natural models are dealt with in detail by Yacovleff (1932b).

KEY TO ILLUSTRATIONS The drawings illustrating this work were made specifically to illuminate its argument* Studies of this sort are most useful if pro fusely illustrated, tut if one is to include many drawings it is some times necessary to compromise on other points. In the case of drawings from published sources I have not keyed the colors (since many different keys were used in the originals) and have often not included shape draw ings, although shapes figure in the seriation. I have provided complete references to the sources of the drawings as well as other illustrations of the same vessel for readers wishing to use the specimen in their own work. In the case of previously unpublished specimens I have general ly provided shape drawings but, with a single exception (fig. 13), have not keyed the colors. Drawings of representations from specimens in the Robert H. Lowie Museum of Anthropology, are sketches rather than measured drawings which would have taken into account the distortion involved in transferring them from a three- to a two-dimensional surface. The sketch es are not drawn to scale, nor do they approximate the scale of the shape drawings. Most drawings were made by the author. Pig. 13 was drawn by Thomas Weiler from photographs taken by Patricia J. Lyon. Lyon also drew figs. 11,23,25,29,32,33,37a,38,41-44,46a,54,63,69a,73a,75,79,82,83a,86, 88a,89,91a,94a,95,96a, 97,101,102,103,105a, 106,108b, 109,111-113,119,123a, 129,131-133a,140,143,148,157,168,172,177,179,199,202,203,236,248,250.</page><page sequence="31">31 Reference to collection location comes directly from the pub lished source and many of the specimens have since been transferred, especially those listed in private collections.
