<plain_text><page sequence="1">Description as Science and Art: Calvino's Narrative of Observation JOHN HANNAY Italo Calvino imagines "the first storyteller of the tribe" as being surrounded by "signs of the fleeting correspondences between words and things": for primitive man, "Every animal, every object, every relationship took on beneficial or malign powers that came to be called magical powers but should, rather, have been called narrative powers, potentialities contained in the word, in its ability to link itself to other words on the plane of discourse" (Uses 2, 30). Such a conception of language helps to explain the way in which Calvino himself transforms factual observations into fascinating narratives. Inert objects come to life when they are given a name and so linked to a verbal universe filled with the potential for stories, just as scientific theories themselves can aid in making the naming of things a form of narration. Calvino has said that his use of science attempts to recapture through literature his family's influence. Calvino's father was an agronomist, who worked on agricultural experiments; his mother was a botanist and a geneticist; his aunts and uncles were chemists. He explains his vocation as an indirect recuperation of these influences: "If in some way my work has dealt with nature, it is out of a kind of nostalgia for a world that I have lost and that I try to recover through literature" (Stille 37). So science is a positive, if incomplete, means to generating the "magical power" of narrative. Calvino's methods for building narratives upon scientific descriptions reveal a development from his earlier fantasies into what I will call the "narrative of Mosaic 21/4 0027-1276-88/010073-14$01.50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">74 John Hannay observation" in his last work, wherein—contrary to the judgment of some critics he most successfully integrates narrative with scientific description. Written in the mid-1960s, Cosmicomics and TZero build fantastic, anthropomorphic animations out of excerpts from writings on cosmology, biology, evolution and mathematical logic. Mr. Palomar, published in 1983, synthesizes essay and narrative styles by describing the observations, scientific analyses and meditations of a character only modestly endowed with acumen. In all these works he animates objects and personifies animals, but in the earlier books he works from primordial settings and allows free reign to his fantasy, whereas in the later book he sets himself the more difficult task of making naturalistic descriptions of mundane, contemporary life appear jarringly strange. The earlier works tease with ribald humor; the later work instructs with dry, but nonetheless humane, wit. In Cosmicomics and the first part of T Zero, Calvino presents a radical juxtapo sition of science and narrative that leaves extremely problematic any notion of assimilation. He begins each story with an italicized, introductory statement drawn from science and follows with a cartoon-like narrative, in roman type, whose imagery and concepts transform the scientific description into the setting for a story. On the one hand, the narratives popularize and dramatize, literally animate, rather dry, conventionally authoritative scientific descriptions of the origin of the universe. As Carter suggests, the stories overcome the numbing sparseness of the scientific rhetoric and defamiliarize, make strange again, the almost inconceivable origins of language, the world and life (73, 82). On the other hand, the stories appear to mock the one-dimensional, colorless language of science by exaggerat ing their metaphoric potential. According to Kathryn Hume, metaphoric ambigui ties of the narratives complement and complicate the straightforward scientific prose, placing science in the context of human desires and associating fact with "joy, wonder and love" ("Science" 50-53). One could also say, however, that the juxtaposition highlights the contrast and criticizes through irony the sterile coldness of scientific prose and its insufficiency for describing phenomena. The narrator's, Qfwfq's, paradoxical, dual levels of existence accentuate the problematic combination of scientific logic and absurdist fantasies. Calvino says that he intended Qfwfq to be an anthropomorphization of science: [Qfwfg] is more than anything a voice or a pair of eyes, a pair of human eyes, a kind of anthropomorphization of a biological creature. I tried to do for modern science what primitive people have done with the forces of nature: personify them with figures between the human and the animal. These stories are the legends and the myths of the world of science. Science has become more and more removed from the world of images, more and more abstract, so that to enter into it we have to populate it with concrete and visible images. (Stille 39) In this formulation, Calvino presents Qfwfq's function as straightforward: his adventures personify the scientific statements about the genesis of galaxies, the evolution of species, and the beginnings of space, time, color and language. One thinks of creation accounts such as Hesiod's Theogony. Here Calvino explicitly</page><page sequence="3">Calvino 's Scientific Art 75 describes himself as performing a service to science: renewing our curiosity in the forces and objects of nature by revivifying through concrete and visible images the increasingly abstract language of science—that is, releasing its narrative potential. According to Carter, Calvino is presenting a fantasy of freedom within all space, with Qfwfq functioning to humanize the strange and make familiar the unknown (73-82). Or again, to Hume ("Calvino") and Anca Vlasopolos, Qfwfq enacts the contrasting, cosmic principles of eros (by falling in love with various female creatures) and disharmony (by ending his affairs in sad separation) underlying both scientific and narrative descriptions of the world. What these laudatory interpretations of Calvino's animation of modern science do not explain is why the language of the fantasy narratives exudes playfully metaphoric ambiguities that seem to mock the scientific statements. In the "At Daybreak" section of Cosmicomics, when Calvino first quotes a scientist explain ing how the solar system evolved "from the condensation of a fluid, shapeless nebula" (19) and then describes Qfwfq as curling up in a nebula along with his large extended family, all tucked under a layer of fluid, grainy matter, dozing and scratching themselves because all the free particles spinning around cause them to itch, one wonders if the animation is not rather at odds with the scientific imagery. The point may be to suggest a correspondence between a family waking up and the original appearance of the sun, but the details are so absurd as to confound, rather than to help picture, the scientific account. Instead of revealing human desire in the phenomenal world or of the way personal myth corresponds to scientific hypothe sis, Qfwfq's insouciant whimsicality often makes the fantasy appear as an irrele vant (and irreverent) borrowing of the trappings of cosmology. In Part Two of T Zero, "Priscilla," Calvino begins to move beyond ironic contrasts, more closely linking his narratives with scientific ideas. He first presents seven philosophic and scientific statements on mutability and cell division and then has Qfwfq recreate this process in three sections, entitled "Mitosis," "Meiosis" and "Death." At one point in "Mitosis," he describes the ambiguous moment when the accumulation of matching chromosomes nears completion: So my cytoplasm fibers were also becoming concentrated in two opposing directions and were growing thin in the middle until the moment came when I seemed to have two equal bodies, one on one side and one on the other, joined by a bottle-neck that was becoming finer and finer until it was only a thread, and at that instant I was for the first time aware of plurality, for the first and last time because it was late by then, I felt the plurality in me as the image and destiny of the world's plurality, and the sense of being part of the world, of being lost in the innum erable world, and at the same time the still-sharp sense of being me (72) Here Calvino more adequately achieves the goal of populating with concrete and visible images the abstractions of science; this story renews the language of science by creating a correspondence between the language of love and the process of cell division. Mitosis becomes an extended metaphor of the agonizing experience of individuality following union, and this released narrative potential in turn helps focus our curiosity and powers of perception on the physical process.</page><page sequence="4">76 JohnHannay In Mr. Palomar, Calvino converts description into story by narrating an obser vant Mr. Palomar's raised—then subsequently dashed—hopes for a fully adequate intersection of language with the sensory world. When he was writing Mr. Palomar Calvino observed: "My present interest in descriptions is due to the fact, I must confess, that the book I'm writing includes several descriptions. I try to make description turn into a story while remaining just a description. In every story of this book there is a character who thinks only insofar as he sees, and mistrusts every thought coming to him by any other means" ("Written" 39). Gore Vidal has praised Calvino for having "a scientist's respect for data, which he claims differentiates Calvino from the surrealist or fantasist. In particular, Vidal praises the form of Mr. Palomar for being "written in the present tense, like a scientist making reports on that ongoing experiment, the examined life" (6). Mr. Palomar examines life and nature with a deceptively smooth transition between objective description and subjective meditation, and so demonstrates that the activity of science can become the material of fiction, reflected through the personality of the observer. Because he makes descriptions yield stories, yet remain essentially descrip tions, Calvino achieves his goal of renewing curiosity in the objects of nature and strengthening our powers of perception: "To renew a relationship between lan guage and world perhaps the first operation is the simplest: fixing our attention on an object, any object, to the most trivial and familiar, and describing it minutely, as if it were the newest and most interesting thing in the world" ("Word" 39). We might well hear in this remark not only a creative writing instructor, but also a science teacher. Despite other differences in their aims, science and literature both require one to defamiliarize objects in order to intensify one's powers of descrip tion, to enhance observation by renaming familiar objects with a language freshly alive and full of potential for arousing curiosity (see Jo Ann Cannon's gloss on "defamiliarization" and its relation to phenomenology in the works of Calvino, 190-92). Calvino's model is Galileo, more than Dante, in creating descriptions that map the world, though he felt that Galileo was indebted to Dante for his deep-rooted, Italian "thirst for knowledge that may by turns be theological, speculative, magical, encyclopedic, or may be concerned with natural philosophy or with transfiguring, visionary observation." Calvino finds nourishment in Galileo's "precision of language, his scientific-poetic imagination, his posing of conjec tures" (Uses 32). He emulates these qualities in an endeavor to interanimate science and poetry—propelling science into courageous acts of imagination, but restraining fiction through the lessons science teaches of patient, precise observa tion and modest consideration of every result as only an approximation of the truth. Calvino envisions a culture in which "the problems of science, those of philoso phy and those of literature are continually challenging each other" ("Philosophy" 872). The emphasis here is on "challenging," for Calvino's efforts toward such a culture indicate not a merging or conflation of these areas, but rather a dialectic of complementarity. While science inspires hope for, and indeed would be central to, a universal vision of self and world, the failure of that vision to emerge (a dominant theme in Mr. Palomar) requires literature to formulate an adjustment in our</page><page sequence="5">Calvino 's Scientific Art 77 expectations of knowledge. Science's lessons in close observation and description can and, indeed, in our world today, must serve as a starting point for reforming the language of literature, but it is up to literature to explore the emotional difficulties of living with uncertain knowledge. Mr. Palomar, "perhaps because he bears the same name as a famous observa tory" (38), affords Calvino license "to rehabilitate a literary genre which has fallen into disuse, namely, the description. The operation of description is sometimes a frustrating one because when you reach the most minute detail, there is always another detail still more minute. The sense that my book gives is of the inexhausti bility of reality. Every chapter is both a reflection and a description. It's about the process of knowledge" (Stille 38). The genre of description, as sketched here and practiced in the stories of Mr. Palomar, initially seems a straightforward act of detailing what one sees, but it soon becomes complicated by an analysis of the kaleidoscopic perspectives possible, given finer and finer detail, and their endless permutations. As a result, the process of observation gives rise to reflections upon knowledge: since every new perspective creates a fresh domain of analytic thought, no knowledge can satisfy the craving for certainty and completeness. In an essay on "Cybernetics and Ghosts," Calvino makes the point that "every analytical process, every division into parts, tends to provide an image of the world that is even more complicated" (Uses 9). Though reality can be seen as the permutations of a limited set of discrete variables or entities, it is inexhaustible because of their endless combinations and the possibility of further breaking down each element into its component parts. Analysis begins by reducing, but in the end complicates reality. This is the essence of science as Calvino depicts it here in potentially endless variation. Each of the stories in Mr. Palomar generates a "narrative of observation" out of this logic of analysis, moving from reduction to expansion and indeterminacy. Over and over again, Mr. Palomar starts with a simple method for describing what he observes, but soon stumbles and falls. His excogitations illustrate the curiosity and ceaseless questioning we associate with a scientist. Insofar as description of an object becomes, under the pressure of Mr. Palomar's analysis and reflections, a search for the meeting ground of language and the world, a congregation of correspondences among science, philosophy and literature, he accords with such meditations as Lewis Thomas's Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony. Mr. Palomar, however, goes beyond this to connect personal anxieties with the indeterminacies he confronts. No doubt some scientists make such associations, but for the most part they keep them hidden from public view. When Mr. Palomar finds that his initially solid-seeming meeting ground of language and the world proves treacherous and fails to support his simple models for understanding, he fully vents his disappointment, frustration and resignation. The first story in Mr. Palomar, "Reading a Wave," begins with Mr. Palomar standing on the shore, looking at a wave and trying to describe it. Although this would seem to be a simple enough project, even though he observes a multitude of aspects about a wave, its colors, movements, shapes and responses to the wind, he feels that his description is incomplete and that he has failed in his attempt "simply</page><page sequence="6">78 JohnHannay to see a wave—that is, to perceive all its simultaneous components without overlooking any of them." While finding more and more aspects of the wave to observe, Mr. Palomar frequently reflects upon his limitations as both an observer and human being. He is "A nervous man who lives in a frenzied and congested world," who "to defend himself against the general neurasthenia... tries to keep his sensations under control insofar as possible" (4). Like Beckett's characters, who futilely seek simplification and peace of mind by trying to describe or otherwise focus on a small set of variables, Mr. Palomar hopes his close observation of a single wave will reduce the overwhelming surfeit of stimulation. Realizing that his method does not protect him from the battering of his nervous system by his mind's surfeit of analytic perspectives, Mr. Palomar tries to limit his field of observation (as he later does in a meditation on the lawn) to a square zone of sea ten meters by ten meters. He finds, however, that everything that happens in that square becomes shaped and defined by what surrounds it. His patience is strained to its limit as he seeks to adjust his field of observation to his elusive goal. "If it were not for his impatience to reach a complete, definitive conclusion of his visual operation, looking at waves would be a very restful exercise for him and could save him from neurasthenia, heart attack and gastric ulcer" (6). Looking at waves could even be "the key to mastering the world's complexity by reducing it to its simplest mechanism." His analysis, like science in beginning with simple and precisely limited observation and analysis but then projecting a total system of knowledge, ironic ally makes reality unfathomably complex and disrupts stable correspondences between the micro- and the macrocosm. Analysis of a limited set of variables offers our only hope of knowledge, but having to choose which variables to observe ironically leads to an endless series of possible subsets to analyze. "Concentrating the attention on one aspect makes it leap into the foreground and occupy the square, just as, with certain drawings, you have only to close your eyes and when you open them the perspective has changed" (7). The book's jacket illustration, "Draftsman with Reclining Woman" by Albrecht Dürer, shows a man drawing a semi-nude woman by looking at her through a screen or grid with large squares that match the squares on his paper. The print wittily implies that reducing a nude to squares in order to aid in perspectives flies in the face of the actual complexity of human perception, not to mention the erotic possibilities suppressed in the act of observation. In practice, the scientific method of simplification contradicts the goal of completeness. The more we look, the more we can observe, and the more we observe the more we realize the arbitrariness of our limited selection of variables: "at each moment [Mr. Palomar] thinks he has managed to see everything to be seen from his observation point, but then something always crops up that he had not borne in mind" (6). Calvino's descrip tions teach us to face this infinite regression and discover in it a general lesson in humility. Are we learning this lesson at Mr. Palomar's expense, or does he learn not to place excessive trust in analytic reduction? On the one hand, Mr. Palomar des pairs, for his patience is exhausted long before he manages to identify all aspects of</page><page sequence="7">Calvino 's Scientific Art 79 even a single wave, much less to extend this limited knowledge to the entire universe. The concluding paragraph appears to suggest that the failing is his: "It would suffice not to lose patience, as he soon does. Mr. Palomar goes off along the beach, tense and nervous as when he came, and even more unsure about every thing" (8). Could another observer, with greater patience, have succeeded? Possibly, but the reasons for Mr. Palomar's failure would seem to condemn us all. On the other hand, Mr. Palomar's project provided him with a goal, however unattainable: to interact with the world through thought and thought's medium, language. He has pursued his natural inclination to be inquisitive and discover more dimensions to reality than were initially apparent. Furthermore, Mr. Palomar's tenseness, though not praised, can be taken as a sign of intellectual integrity; he has not satisfied himself with half-truths, deluding himself that his knowledge is complete. As we get to know more and more of his endeavors, we grow more considerate of his limitations because they in fact display his searching and obser vant mind. In this light, his despair signals intellectual vigor, not victimization. Does such a positive reading of this story imply that Mr. Palomar has acquired self-knowledge that will help him in his next endeavor? Does he learn from his failures to be more modest in his aspirations, to become, in a word, wise? Does the order of the stories indicate a deepening and progressive encounter with the world and himself? It would seem not. In an "Index" at the end of Mr. Palomar, Calvino describes the order of his stories as progressing from description, to narrative, to meditation. As Carter points out, however, the categories are blurred and progress is less evident than repetition of a formula (140, 145-47). All three elements are present in each story, in varying amounts, for description becomes a story about the process of description, and the character's reflections become a meditation on, and finally a despair about, the possibilities of self-knowledge. Repeatedly the stories start with Mr. Palomar's naive hope for or faith in knowledge, depict his futile struggle to achieve that knowledge, and reflect upon his failure to attain it. They do become more general and abstract at the end, and this reflects the reader's growing awareness of the generality of Mr. Palomar's intellectual quest. If more general, how ever, his inquiries become, if anything, even more disappointingly unanswerable. This repeated formula suits the notion that the process of observation provides, if not answers, at least an inexhaustible stimulus for curiosity. At the end of the book, in the conclusion with the symbolic title, "Learning to Be Dead," Mr. Palomar "decides that he will set himself to describing every instant of his life, and until he has described them all he will no longer think of being dead" (126). At this moment, untutored yet undaunted by his earlier failures, he dies. Why go on? Nature's inevitable triumph over mental volition mocks our intellection. Mr. Palomar has failed to describe even one experience complete, let alone all. Yet it is the search, not the finding, that matters. Mr. Palomar's attempt to describe the world continually renews his enthusiasm and can be for the reader an ultimate source of inspiration, an heroic if perhaps overweening ideal. We pity Mr. Palomar for the futility of his quest, but we recognize ourselves in his frustrations and can admire his determination to acquire wisdom, despite his failure to do so. Like Beckett's characters, Mr. Palomar displays an appealing, Chaplinesque indefati gability in confronting the void.</page><page sequence="8">80 John Hannay Mr. Palomar can be seen as a more profound example of the same paradigm of failure that Calvino had earlier depicted in terms of social oppression in Marcovaldo or The Seasons in the City, a collection of stories written in the early 1950s and the mid-1960s. This collection creates a panorama of the urban environment as seen through the eyes of a common observer, much as Mr. Palomar does with the surroundings of its eponymous hero. Marcovaldo similarly describes the pervasive presence of animals and plants in this environment, emphasizing the incongruity between nature and modern cosmopolitan life. Thus we find stories about a herd of cows passing through the labyrinth of city streets, cats inhabiting a city park and preventing construction on it, wasps swarming into a tiny apartment, and a huge plant Marcovaldo carries on his bicycle obstructing traffic. Marcovaldo's con flicts, however, are social: he attempts to make his numbing work and dreary home-life more interesting by spending a night on the park bench, hunting mushrooms under sidewalk tree roots, or trying to sleep in the sand. Inevitably, each situation proves self-defeating, foundering in the wealthier world of super markets, hospitals, airplanes and construction crews. Mr. Palomar's conflicts are intellectual, to the almost complete exclusion of society, but they are like Marcovaldo's in that both of their failures are alleviated by small, humorous observations. What might seem a narrowing of perspective in moving from Marcovaldo to Mr. Palomar is, in reality, a greater universality attained by more abstract, yet nonethe less detailed description, analysis and reflection. Mr. Palomar, like Marcovaldo, verges on pomposity at times in his effort to create elaborate schemes to outwit nature and his fellow man. Martin McLaughlin praises this debunking, while criticizing its predictability (45-46). Yet Calvino's delightfully humorous under cuttings of Mr. Palomar's attempts to order reality are more than a mechanical plot device repeated with little variation. Rather, they endlessly expand the possibilities of description by discovering narrative potential in odd details and congruencies. Mr. Palomar excogitates on the kinds of grasses in a lawn as emblem of the universe in the manner of Burton's Anatomy. With this attention to detail, the world becomes a varied and, at times, delightful puzzle in every aspect. Science, as Calvino conceives it, not only teaches patience, precision and tolerance for the ordinariness of reality, it also exposes us to surreal, fantastic realms that can be, at times, profoundly alienating. In "The Order Squamata," when Mr. Palomar visits the reptile room in the zoo and contemplates the iguana in its recreated environment, he reflects upon the ironies of imitation. The cages are modeled on real places, and the animals serve as types of their species. Torn from their natural continuum and maintained in a controlled temperature and humidity, however, they appear surreal, fantastic, almost as if they were constructs of art: "Thus every sample of this antediluvian bestiary is kept alive artificially, as if it were a hypothesis of the mind, a product of the imagination, a construction of language, a paradoxical line of reasoning meant to demonstrate that the only true world is our own" (87). To use terms Margot Norris has defined and discussed in relation to literature that imitates animal consciousness (esp. 1-5), Mr. Palomar wavers between</page><page sequence="9">Calvino 's Scientific Art 81 viewing himself biocentrically, as part of this bestial heritage, and anthropocen trically, as a producer of recreated images. He is himself an animal, but also a human being that places other animals in an artificial environment so that he may contemplate their similarities and differences. Either view alienates him from his project of description; as animal, he rejects language for relating to objects, but as human, language becomes a cage, a falsifying imitation, all the more dishearten ing because of its inescapability. This conflation of intellectual hierarchy shatters Mr. Palomar's Cartesian sense of individuality, so he "hurries to leave the reptile house, which can be visited only now and then and in haste" (88). Other such moments occur for Mr. Palomar as he looks at the world around him and realizes his similarity to animals: the tortoises' mating seems a caricature of his own erotic behavior; the giraffes' uncoordinated, unharmonious movements remind him of his mind's clumsy lack of order and harmony; the gecko's swallow ing of a butterfly reminds him of the massacres he has seen on television. The exodus and return of knowledge, first observing the objective world and then reflecting on subjective correspondences, produces disquieting insights. Mr. Palomar could seem disillusioned and satiric like Flaubert's Bouvard et Pecuchet, which also presents naive characters who attempt encyclopedic knowledge about the natural world and are shatterèd by their failure to achieve wisdom or happiness. Whereas the search wearies and disheartens Flaubert's characters, however, it intrigues Calvino's Mr. Palomar, and he recovers from his anomie. Whereas Flaubert's failures of knowledge are frequently disastrous absurdities, Calvino's are admirably perceptive, if amusingly inconclusive, intellectual adventures. Like Bouvard and Pecuchet, but with greater precision and comprehension, Mr. Palomar nostalgically ponders various venerable philosophies that map out a set of correspondences linking scientific imagination with traditional literary tropes. Yet he refuses the comfort of such unity, rejecting blurred or outdated concepts that do not lend themselves to immediate, demonstrable evidence. In "The Eye and the Planets," Mr. Palomar thinks about the Olympian names given to planets, but he rejects the dazzling "dream of classicality" this engenders and invokes instead the spirit of Galileo in espousing a return to precise observations of the outline, shadow and color of the planets: "let the imagination strip away borrowed garments and renounce its show of book learning... .Though it is right for the imagination to come to support weakness of vision, it must be immediate and direct like the gaze that kindles it" (41). This may seem a conclusive decision, but Mr. Palomar repeatedly vacillates between intellection and observation, as if his impulse toward one depended on its opposition to the other. Microcosmic/macrocosmic analogies complement observation in a dialectic process whereby the external world becomes a model of self through reflections on language. Mr. Palomar, however, remains dissatisfied with the correspondences he thinks he discovers. In "The Blackbird's Whistle" he hopes to find in the similar whistles of man and blackbird a means for overcoming "the discrepancy between human behavior and the rest of the universe" which has for him "always been a source of anguish" (27). The bird-whistles, however, offer no clue that the birds recognize any similarity with his whistle, so the correspondences remain indetermi</page><page sequence="10">82 John Hannay nate, leading to further and further observations. In "The Albino Gorilla," a gorilla contemplating an old tire seems almost to comprehend in this empty circle all symbols of order, "to reach, in the depths of silence, the springs from which language burst forth, to establish a flow of relationships between his thoughts and the unyielding, deaf evidence of the facts that determine his life." Yet later that night, this symbol for language seems pathetic, "an old, empty tire through which we try to reach some final meaning, which words cannot achieve" (83). If language is tempered by the discipline of observation, then objects may come alive with narrative powers, imbued with correspondences to our spiritual selves through the expansive capacity of language. Without the discipline of observation, our descriptions of objects implode. Calvino's project elliptically joins modern science with the medieval system of correspondences, Flaubert with St. Thomas. In "Emblems of the Emotions," Calvino praised the imagination of Donald Evans for creating postage stamps that presented an entirely fictitious, yet recog nizable world through imagined objects, figures and events. Calvino found in Evans's miniature emblems of an imaginary world—pictures of furniture, histor ical persons and commemorative holidays—a kindred spirit who linked detailed observations of external objects to internal worlds through a system of analogies. Metonymically these emblems evoke an entire country and pattern of life, much as do the emblems in the deck of tarot cards in Calvino's Castle of Crossed Destinies (1969) or the earthly and heavenly cities in Invisible Cities (1912). Mr. Palomar, however, does not permit such an imagined complete, ordered system; the harmony Calvino posits between correspondences and phenomeno logical observation remains unstable, for reality confounds the integrative powers of language. In fact, Mr. Palomar would appear to value science more than symbolic systems, alchemical models and archaic analogies precisely because its experimental method continually punctures the surface of its model and correspon dences. As if he were echoing Bacon's exhortations, Calvino frequently reminds us that our empirical observations are hampered by various "Idols," by imperfect knowledge of a language for a complex and unstable world. In "The Infinite Lawn," the chaotic proliferation of the lawn undermines the orderly hierarchy of categories of finite but countless species of grasses that Mr. Palomar imagines might reflect the universe as a whole. Even science's tools of observation—the maps of the stars, the photographs of Voyager 2, the anthropological guides to pre-Columbian ruins—lead only to an imperfect structuring of reality. The culmin ation of this deflation of symbolic systems occurs in "The Model of Models," in which Mr. Palomar confronts not only the failure of models to correspond to reality, but also the tendency of language, in defining this failure, to reify and become a static model of models failing to correspond to a fluid reality. In "The Contemplation of the Stars," Mr. Palomar consults a confusing array of astronomical charts, seeking the "exact geometry of the sidereal spaces" (46), promised not only by modern science, but also by the wisdom of the ancients. Instead of a timeless, unchangeable perfection, he finds the sky to be a world of uncertainty, a "place of superfluous complications and confused approximations" that imitates the earth rather than proving an ideal contrast. The uncertainty derives</page><page sequence="11">Calvino 's Scientific Art 83 partly from the failure of the maps to accommodate the overwhelming fullness of the heavens, their inundation of complications. But it also derives from Mr. Palomar's method of observation, which seeks a static model to account for the fluid, continually interrupted patterns of observable reality. Neither the modern scientific nor the classical mythological maps of the heavens can account for the pervasive flux of reality, for example the intrusive lights of a commercial plane (47-48). As Cannon puts it, Palomar represents "consciousness itself, swimming in a continuum of indeterminacy and uncertainty a consciousness afloat in the sea of objectivity" (198). We see, more clearly than does Mr. Palomar, that the certainty he had been seeking was an entrapping illusion, and to be released from it a relief. Relief it may be, but uncertainty also can seem a burden, and coping with it requires inner resources. Like Joyce's Leopold Bloom, whose puzzled musings about astronomy often appear humorously simplistic though endearingly enthusia stic, Mr. Palomar rather inexpertly flips through the charts and schedules in hopes of detaching himself from the mundane world of complications. Those of us who have similarly struggled with anything from the periodic table of elements to the matrix theory of general relativity find our helplessness embodied in his plight. The theory may be there, and the general method for relating it to the world of physical phenomena, but the actual employment of knowledge creates intimidat ing uncertainty. No doubt scientists, who sometimes must feel daunted in this way, would point to the thrill they feel when the theory accurately predicts the pheno mena and to their delight in the pure objectivity of knowledge. Such ecstatic moments, however, generally elude the average person. Mr. Palomar, no better than the average person, does not retreat. Though stymied, he remains on the beach, craning his neck while looking alternately up at the stars and down at his maps. His name ironically suggests how unlike a powerful telescope he is, how ill-suited he so often is to his role of observer. His gestures appear "like the convulsions of a madman" to nearby observers, but his gaze remains "alert, available, released from all certitude" (48). He retains a curiosity and concentration despite his doubtfulness about the success of his observations. He may be right about what he sees, he may be wrong, or he may have been misled by inaccurate charts. Still he keeps on with his observations, hoping that attention to the celestial revolutions will imprint upon his mind a contact with the laws of the universe. In rare moments he attains his goal and observes reality anew. When he finds the right name for a star, it acquires "a salience it lacked before" (45), suggesting his own heightened perception and renewed enthusiasm. Calvino has said, "Every moment we expect that the secret watermark of the universe is about to become visible against the light—an expectation that is always disappointed, as is right" ("Philosophy" 872). As Cannon puts it, however, the "inconclusiveness" of Palomar's quest for escape from the labyrinth of the world should not "be read as a sign of surrender," but rather as "a challenge to comprehend the multiform and indeterminate world" (199). Calvino affectionately sympathizes with Mr. Palomar's plight and approves his efforts despite Mr. Palomar's anxious restlessness. The</page><page sequence="12">84 John Hannay reader, perhaps, derives more satisfaction than does Mr. Palomar from his task of describing the objective world—at least, a reader who knows the treacherous instability of language and feels inspired by the discovery of small correspondences. While this reiterated discounting of ideal models and the possibilities for description might seem overwhelmingly negative, it is not. Franco Ricci, like Carter, thinks that Mr. Palomar epitomizes cynicism, misanthropic intellectualism and negative neo-Pirandellian introspection, that "Palomar is emotionally dead" (Carter 145, Feingold 34-36). Ricci finds the stories in Mr. Palomar perverse: "A perfidious idea leads to megalomaniac investigation and conjecture tempered by the foreboding knowledge of non-existence and superfluity" (239). That is, each tale reduces Mr. Palomar to an abstract, emotionless void epitomizing the absur dity and vacuity of ratiocination. In characterizing Palomar's solitude as nihilistic, however, Ricci misses the redemptive value of Palomar's probing, humorous self reflections. Palomar is not, as Ricci says, "an unqualified prophecy of man's destruction" (243), but a highly qualified embodiment of perceptive bemusement. Restless uncertainty need not imply pessimism. On the contrary, disquietude leads Mr. Palomar to continue to seek understanding. In Mr. Palomar's endlessly frustrated quest for certainty, Calvino makes of science and rationality tools not for ironic denial, but affirmation of human curiosity. Carter, seeing in Mr. Palomar a diminishment of fantasy in comparison with Calvino's earlier works, characterizes it as exhaustion, "a series of variations on a theme that has probably gone on long enough" (147). Carter sees Mr. Palomar as deriving no vitalizing power from his excogitations. He admits that Mr. Palomar is an interesting observer with an epic range of fascinations, but he refuses to accept these virtues as making up for the obsessive and sterile nature of Palomar's thinking. Carter admires Calvino in his modes of fantasy and can see only denial and rationalization in Mr. Palomar, which I see as characterized by excitement and energy derived from close obser vations of and pointed reflections about ordinary reality. Like Leopold Bloom, who contemplates skeptically the "heaventree of stars" in the penultimate chapter of Joyce's Ulysses, Mr. Palomar realizes that the correspon dences are not working, that the contemplation of the stars does not create a corresponding harmony with or knowledge of his fellows, and that analysis and empirical observations lead only to further obscurities. Considering the external world to be "a mirror in which we can contemplate only what we have learned to know in ourselves," he searches his inner world with high expectations of discover ing "a sphere of infinite circumference that has the ego as its center and its center in every point" (119-20). But he ends by finding only confusion and aggression. For Calvino, as for Joyce and Flaubert, the universe mirrors the soul not in harmony, but in discord, restlessness and indirection. Nevertheless, Calvino, like Joyce but unlike Flaubert, presents a character who accepts the ongoing struggle, refusing to allow his disappointed hope for harmony and unity to embitter or defeat him. Unsettled, bewildered and insecure, but not despondent, in the final paragraph in "The Universe as Mirror," Mr. Palomar looks at the starry sky scattering "intermittent flashes like a stalled mechanism, which jerks and creaks in all its unoiled joints, outposts of an endangered universe,</page><page sequence="13">Calvino 's Scientific Art 85 twisted, restless as he is" (120). The metaphor of a machine takes on new effect in this vision of cosmic disharmony. The word "endangered" connotes a Darwinian perspective, merging old and new views in a general scramble for survival. Mr. Palomar, even more than Leopold Bloom, accommodates a defeated hope for the old correspondences through his indefatigable curiosity for present knowledge. True he will remain forever "restless"—his final project, to describe each instant of his life, we know is doomed in advance since each instant, when described, expands so that its end can no longer be seen (126)—but this signals his ceaseless activity and enthusiasm, not just anxiety; he will continue to engage the universe in a quest for knowledge until his death. As Carter (146, 167n) and Cannon (197-98) point out, Calvino distances himself from Mr. Palomar. But the distance can be read as comic sympathy, not ironic mockery. The text allows either interpretation, for while Mr. Palomar does not, in the end, become wise, he nonetheless has had moments of insight that have resulted from his insistent curiosity. After contemplating a Japanese sand garden and discerning analogies between the regular lines in the sand formed by a rake, the mass movements of humans, and the indifferent, irreducible boulders of the world, Mr. Palomar finds "a sense of possible harmony, as if between two nonhomogeneous harmonies: that of the nonhuman in a balance of forces that seems not to cor respond to any pattern, and that of human structures, which aspire to the ration ality of a geometrical or musical composition, never definitive..."(ellipsis his, 94). Never will the irregular physical forces perfectly accommodate them selves to rational human structures, but neither will they entirely occlude "a sense of possible harmony," observed by Mr. Palomar at endearing, if evanescent, moments such as this. Finding such a harmony through the repeated pattern of description, analysis and self-reflection teaches us to see a link between the worlds of science and literature, a common ground in the process of observation. On the positive side, Mr. Palomar learns, though late in life and only in theory, "that salvation lies solely in applying oneself to the things that are there" (52). When disillusioned with imprecise reality, he reverts "to the direct observation of visible forms" (53). Science subordinates subjective fantasies to the novelty, the plots, of empirical observation. On the negative side, the repeated disappointment of his goal of understanding makes either the project or the investigator appear foolish, as if Mr. Palomar were wasting time on a futile task. Such alternatives cannot be conclusively argued, for much will depend on our idea of success. If one requires that knowledge lead to certainty, then of course Mr. Palomar will seem a study in frustration and despair. Yet if one accepts uncertainty as part of the discipline of knowledge, in both science and literature, then Mr. Palomar's explorations will enlighten the reader about the limits, but also the attractions, of observation. We will see his engagements not—as Calvino self mockingly puts it—as "a series of intellectual misadventures not worth recalling" (113), but as a parable of restless curiosity, the story of our age. In all three works, Cosmicomics, T Zero and Mr. Palomar, Calvino explores the narrative potential he finds in physical objects. In his earlier mode of fantasy,</page><page sequence="14">86 John Hannay however, the objective language of science remained largely separate from the subjective language of feeling expressed in the narratives. In the later mode of observation, Calvino fuses these two languages through a humanistic methodo logy of description, analysis and reflection regarding the objective world as well as the emotional responses of a lay scientist. Calvino still insists upon a lack of harmony between ideas of order and the actual world, but in Mr. Palomar the disharmony arises as a product of scientific observation and curiosity, not from the incongruity of conventionally authoritative science and fantasy narrative. Offering not just a neutral set of facts, but a process of discovery, partial comprehension and renewed questioning, science provides Calvino's narratives with a perpetually renewable stimulus for curiosity as well as a model for adjusting to indeterminacy.
