The early fifteenth cen- tury saw both the discovery of linear or 'classical' perspective by early Renaissance artists and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi and Leonbattista Alberti and, subsequently, a variety of alternatives and challenges to the careful mathe- matical order posited by such systems of representation. In the case of anamorphosis, its curious effects were first un- derstood and explored by Leonardo da Vinci who included anamorphic drawings of a child's head in his CodexAtlanticus (1483-1518) [1]. Anamorphic projection seeks to deny the usual conven- tions of 'looking' in which an observer views an image frontally from a limited range of viewing angles. It is a technique of disruption and distortion. However, any ex- planation of its mechanisms necessarily begins with a discus- sion of classical perspective. It is an effect that is explained by-yet seeks to undermine-classical methods of perspec- ? 1992 ISAST Pergamon Press pic. Printed in Great Britain. 0024-094X/92 $3.00+0.00 tival representation. An image subjected to this class of per- spectival distortion still depends upon a classical (Euclidean) paradigm: light travels in straight lines; when light reflected from an object intersects a planar surface-whether it is a pane of glass or Alberti's gridded velo- an accurate representation of the source object can be de- scribed. The crucial difference from classical perspective is that an observer positioned to re- ceive the undistorted view of an anamorphic image would have to be at a radically oblique angle to the picture plane-and, ABSTRACT The process known in art as anamorphosis or anamorphic projection is at once a confirmation of and a challenge to the rules of linear perspective and the conven- tions of representation. In this first part of a two-part series of articles, the author discusses art-historical and psychoanalytic literature in regard to a role for anamorphosis beyond that of perspective theory. In this discussion, particular em- phasis is placed upon the viewer actively observing the anamorphosis, introducing what the author de- scribes as the 'eccentric observer'. The second part of this article, to follow in the next regular issue of Leonardo, will detail modern uses of anamorphosis, with emphasis on contemporary artworks. not incidentally, have one eye shut to overcome the cor- rective effects of binocular vision [2]. This monocular, self-conscious gaze--exaggerated proof of the 'cone of vi- sion' that explains classical perspective-presumes a subjec- tive viewpoint that reinscribes the source of vision in the physical body. THE ECCENTRIC OBSERVER AND SUBJECTIVE VIEWING The gymnastics necessary for the successful apprehension of the anamorphic image (Fig. 1) casts the observer in an active role in which the conventional relationship to the object of vision is literally thrown 'off-center'. To observe anamorphic images, one must be an 'eccentric observer', that is, an observer who is not only a bit 'eccentric' in the usual sense of the term (i. e. strange), but an observer who is willing to sacrifice a centric vantage point for the possi- bility of catching a glimpse of the uncanny from a position off-axis. While the term 'eccentric observer' could be viewed as an elision of Rudolf Arnheim's terms 'eccentric' and 'centric' (which he employs to describe compositional forces at work in visual art), I am suggesting the eccentric observer as simply an alternative to the usual model of a viewer occupying a central position with respect to the material world. An eccentric observer is exactly the observer Daniel L. Collins (artist, educator), Arizona State University, School of Art, Tempe, AZ 85287-1505, U.S.A. Received 23 September 1988.

(left) This anamorphic work requires viewers to use specific vantage points in order to 'read' the images. Viewers are directed to stand in three positions along an arc on the floor. Four images-a map of the United States, the longitudinal lines of the globe as seen from the North Pole, a cowboy hat and a pentagon-can be recognized at different vantage points. (right) Detail showing image of United States seen from one viewing position. of the anamorphosis, an observer who literally stands apart and is self-aware of the process of seeing. The vantage point of the eccentric observer is not a refutation of a centric viewing posi- tion-it is its shadow. It is the flip-side of the classical construction of vision in which the viewing subject stands at the node of a homolographic, mathemati- cally coherent universe. The traditional centric view is represented by Arnheim, who writes in The Power of the Center: Perceptually a person is a viewer, who sees himself at the center of the world surrounding him. As he moves, the center of the world stayswith him. Con- sidering himself the primary center, he sees the world populated with second- ary objects, eccentric to him. Looking at a sculpture means sending out a vector toward that object: seeing is a manipulation of the object on the part of the viewer. But here again the dy- namics of any center operate recipro- cally, in both outer-directed and inner- directed ways. The work of art sends out its own vectors, attracting and af- fecting the viewer. In fact, the power of the work can become so strong that it is no longer simply an eccentric target. It takes over as the primary center, seemingly governing its own structure, independent of the viewer, who has become immersed in the object, ob- livious of his own outer existence [3]. While not eager to contradict Arn- heim, I would suggest, at the moment that the artwork or object of vision takes over as the primary center, the viewer is no longer the center of the world. An observer 'oblivious of his own outer existence' is neither an observer at the center nor an observer who is a par- ticipant in the construction of mean- ing. My use of the term 'eccentric observer' suggests a viewing subject who not only acknowledges the oblique and contingent nature of her point of view, but who also realizes that the full appreciation of aesthetic objects stems not from 'oblivion' (that is, literally, a 'forgetting') but from playing an active role in the creation of the aesthetic object. With anamorphic images, the me- chanics of vision become foregrounded in a subject/object relation that is no longer bounded by typical conventions of 'looking'. The eccentric observer takes up a position that is at odds with the usual perpendicular station-point; a comfortable binocular world view is traded in for a 'cyclopean' view; and, in the case of two-dimensional ana- morphoses, the sanctity of the picture plane (that window on the painter's universe) with its precise (usually recti- linear) edges and controlled depth-of- field is reduced to a fuzzy trapezoid. To view an anamorphic image is to at- tempt to transform an oblique or non- uniform focal plane into a coherent, two-dimensional image. By virtue of a certain willingness to take risks, coupled with the necessity of observing one's own internal processes at work, the eccentric observer-as well as the act of viewing itself-becomes impli- cated in the dynamics of the artwork. The act of viewing anamorphic images reasserts that the construction of vision is a dynamic, reflexive and self-critical operation. These observations concerning ana- morphic projection and its apprecia- tion find echoes in the somewhat limited literature on the subject. In 1975 in the introduction to the catalog of an important exhibition entitled Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art, the curators write: "Anamorphoses are an extreme example of subjectivization of the viewing pro- cess. The observer is first deceived by a barely recognizable image, and is then directed to a viewpoint dictated by the formal construction of the painting." The etymological origin of the word- from the Greek ana (again/against), morphe (shape/form)-suggests to the authors that "the spectator must play a part and re-form the picture himself" [4]. The particulars of vision at work in the apprehension of anamorphic im- ages, I submit, fall under the larger heading of'subjective vision'-an argu- ment that takes into account the psycho-physiological makeup of the observing subject. The notion of sub- jective vision was explored by many nineteenth-century theorists such as Goethe and Schopenhauer, but a num- ber of recent theorists have given it renewed attention. Columbia Univer- sity art historian Jonathan Crary writes in his recent work on the nineteenth- century observer, for example: "Subjec- tive vision is distinctly temporal, an un- folding of processes within the body, thus undoing notions of a direct corre- spondence between perception and ob- ject" [5]. Subjective vision and the no- tion of the eccentric observer might also serve to expand the definition of the 'gaze' (i. e. visual desire) beyond the contemporary understanding of its use as an instrument for (male) control and possession. Craig Owens's discus- sion of Barbara Kruger's photomon- tage, Your Gaze Hits the Side of My Face (1981) (in which the title is collaged over an image culled from a 1950s pho- tograph of a stone female bust) exem- plifies this linkage of the gaze to ques- 74 Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer *: '.11 .. .</page><page sequence="3">tions of male identity and behavior. Owens asks the question: "Is she not speaking ... of the masculinity of the look, the ways in which it objectifies and masters?" [6] Owens's query is timely and appropriate, but it begs the ques- tion of what role the gaze and subjective vision play when the viewer is redefined as eccentric, mobile and possibly female. Subjective vision reacts against dia- grams of the gaze that map the spatial logic of the world, but exclude the body of the observer. Kruger and Owens succeed in naming the viewing subject. The project now becomes one of rede- fining who does the viewing. The his- tory of art is full of examples that empower particular viewing subjects at the exclusion of others. What ostensibly began as an attempt to render the perfect perspective of an unseen cre- ator may actually have been an elegant method for endorsing particular visions of power and prestige. Discussing the 'Cartesian perspectivalist tradition' in- herited from Alberti and other Renais- sance theorists, University of California historian Martin Jay writes: The moment of erotic projection in vision-what St. Augustine had anxiously condemned as 'ocular de- sire'-was lost as the bodies of the painter and viewer were forgotten in the name of an allegedly disincar- nated, absolute eye. Although such a gaze could, of course, still fall on objects of desire-think, for example, of the female nude in Diirer's fa- mous print of a draftsman drawing her through a screen of perspectival threads-it did so largely in the service of a reifying male look that turned its targets into stone [7]. Part of the attraction of anamorpho- sis is precisely its ability to bind the viewing subject to the object of the gaze. Ironically, the eccentric observer, im- mersed in the subjective autonomy of her own body, perceives a virtual object that insists upon invading the space of the viewer. This is the inverse of classi- cal perspective in which rays emanating from a (usually) 'disembodied' eye de- fine the space of the painting, ulti- mately converging at one or more vanishing points. To dwell in the body of the eccentric observer is to participate in a subtle kind of phenomenology. Certainly 'to observe' is to privilege the human ap- paratus of vision-the eye. But how easy it is to forget that the eye is embedded in a complex array of sensation and feeling called the human body. This body proceeds by a logic of its own-re- sponding to touch, temperatures, ol- factory and gustatory invitations, sounds and, most importantly, kinesthetics. It is this latter process-an inspired re- sponse to the inertia of the earth-bound self that could only be called a love of movement-that characterizes the human species and guarantees the ceaseless shifts in our points of view. Sight, then, is never context-free. Even before confronting the multiple hori- zons constantly presented to the gaze, the eye is conditioned by the emotional balance, the mental state, and the rela- tive fatigue or energy of the observer. Still, it is the eye of the eccentric observer, while skewed with respect to the picture plane, that becomes the primary nexus through which the per- spectival lines of construction pass on their way to the brain. Arnheim is sensitive to the problems of vision en- countered when an observer does not occupy a perpendicular position with respect to the object of the gaze. He touches upon the 'difficulty' of this dy- namic in a discussion of sight lines in traditional theater and painting: The difficulty is caused by the discon- certing fact that we look at our world sideways. Instead of facing it as detached viewers, we are in it and of it, and we therefore see it partially and from a private perspective. Our view interprets but also misinterprets our position in the world, a dilemma result- ing from the ambiguous function of the human mind. In a typically and perhaps exclusively human way we par- ticipate actively in our world while at the same time trying to view it with the noninvolvement of an observer [8]. Besides accurately characterizing the ambivalence that every observer must feel when confronted with an (aes- thetic) object, this statement alludes to problems that have been confronted by theorists in the fields of linguistics and literary criticism-namely, the divided nature of'reading' an aesthetic experience. THE ECCENTRIC OBSERVER AS READER Consider for a moment a typical sub- ject/object relation in which the role of the observer is constructed as follows: the observer's (the subject's) gaze (that invisible connection between an observer and the observed) is directed-or, rather, focused-upon a given object (an apple or a painting; it does not matter). The observer, in focusing the gaze upon the object, 'creates' the object-or, at least, ren- ders it visible. The object becomes a kind of repository for the gaze-or what Jacques Lacan calls 'a trap for the eye'. Still, there is no guarantee that the ob- ject will be the locus of attention. There is not any determinate or obvious con- nection between the 'object of the gaze' and the chaos of images that fill an attentive mind. After a certain relationship between the observer and the object has been framed, the observer still occupies an elastic position with respect to the ob- ject. The seductiveness of an image (in a painting, for example) would cause rational observers 'to lose' themselves to the demands of 'an aesthetic ex- perience'. For the eccentric observer, however, certain associations or body- felt realities registered by the observer have the potential of shifting the sub- ject of the exchange to the identity of the observer. (One could argue in such cases that the observer, not the object, is undergoing change-in a phrase, coming into being.) It may be instructive to turn briefly to an analogy from literary theory in which the relation of reader (analogous to our observer) to a given text (the object of attention) has stirred considerable de- bate. Jonathan Culler posits a kind of guarded dualism between the reader and the text in his book OnDeconstruction: For the reader the work is not partially created but, on the one hand, already complete and inexhaustible-one can read and reread without ever grasping completely what has already been made-and, on the other hand, still to be created in the process of reading without which it is only black marks on paper. The attempt to produce compromise formulations fails to cap- ture this essential, divided quality of reading [9]. And, quoting Sartre, Culler instructs us that "for the reader everything is to be done and everything is already done" [10]. Roland Barthes goes a step further and declares 'The Death of the Author". While I would stop short of such pronouncements, the contribu- tions of Barthes to an understanding of the dynamic role the reader plays in the construction of a work cannot be over- estimated. Barthes, in discussing 'the total existence of writing', issues a polemic: A text is made of multiple writings, drawn from many cultures and enter- ing into mutual relations of dialogue, parody, contestation, but there is one place where this multiplicity is focused, and that place is the reader, not, as was hitherto said, the author. The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer 75</page><page sequence="4">without any of them being lost; a text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination [11]. If our analogy to reading holds, any engagement of the senses-particu- larly the sense of sight upon which we are focusing here-would require an active response from the percipient to be registered as significant. In the act of observing works of art (or any other class of objects worthy of our attention) it would seem essential to acknowledge that the observer not only creates the object by virtue of her directed gaze, but creates the self by virtue of engag- ing what, for the observer, are sig- nificant objects. Art historian Donald Preziosi has commented on the neces- sity of a viewing subject who engages a process of differentiation in order to locate the self in a 'signifying practice'. He writes in his recent book, Rethinking Art History: The process (of differentiation) con- sists of marking out separations be- tween (the Subject) and his surround- ings so that he may find himself a place in the signifying chain. In short, the Subject must recognize himself in the organizing structures of the signifying chain. The place one assigns oneself in knowledge is what makes possible com- munication and meaning [12]. Understanding this experience is de- pendent upon a variety of considera- tions, e. g. assumptions concerning the 'authority' of the object or the message it contains; the capacity of the observer to 'read' either the significance of the object in question or to bring an inter- pretative richness to the experience; the constantly shifting character of both the state of the object (as well as its context) and the status of the observer, any or all of which may be used to argue the dominant or subservient role played by any aspect of the subject/ object relation. Let us telescope the problem into a couple of examples. Consider for a mo- ment the role of the object if defined as a simple mirror. The gaze of the ob server in this case will seldom settle upon the mirror as object, for the Fig. 2. Hans Holbein the Younger, The Ambassadors, oil on panel, 81 ? x 82k in, 1533. The French psychoanalystJacques Lacan inter- prets the ananorphic skull in this work-the diagonal form in the lower part of this picture-first as a phallic image (when encountered head- on), then as a skull (the image 'buried' in the anamorphosis) and finally as a 'trap from the gaze'. (Courtesy of the National Gallery, London) 76 Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer , ,. .... ; .. 7... ..-* ?? --.~~~~~~~~~~~i- "l r</page><page sequence="5">simple reason that the mirror acts to reproduce (albeit virtually) the observer. Its action upon the observer constitutes an invisible intervention in which an equivalence is posited between the observer and the image of the observer. In such cases of 'invisible intervention' (any instantaneous one-to-one corre- spondence between an observer and her image could qualify as such), the object is rendered 'absent' and the identity of the observer is multiplied. Hence the attraction of mirrors: they render the observer as subject even while deflecting attention from their own 'mirrorness' or objecthood [13]. Conversely, imagine the richness and complexity of the altar of a baroque cathedral. Here, the seduction and authority of this particular combina- tion of objects necessarily places the observer in a subservient position. The 'subject' of such an exchange, for the believer, can only be the didactic and normative messages encoded in the object of his or her gaze. Critical inter- pretation is neither encouraged nor warranted. For the observer to enter into an analysis of what she is experienc- ing, or to allow the self or the relation- ship of self to 'other' to become the object of attention, is to explode the intentionality of the altar and the larger experience of the architecture.Jay, dis- cussing 'baroque vision', tells us that "we might wonder about the celebra- tion of ocular madness, which may pro- duce ecstasy in some, but bewilderment and confusion in others.... [The] phan- tasmagoria of baroque spectacle was easily used to manipulate those who were subjected to it" [14]. While it is indeed attractive to em- brace a hypothesis that states unequivo- cally that "a text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination" (as I earlier quoted Barthes [15]), it is also impor- tant to recognize the inertia still extant in certain dynamics between an ob- server and the objects of her gaze. A deep investment in a particular way of seeing-resulting in the single 'theo- logical' meaning (the 'message' of the author-God) discussed by Barthes-will not go away simply because we declare it obsolete. A process of critical engage- ment by active observers will, on the other hand, help to begin the difficult project of deconstructing those one- eyed regimes built upon singular as- sumptions about the proper point of view. Beyond the attractions of mirrors, altars and semiotic theory, the prob- lem for certain artists (those dreaded Fig. 3. Hans Holbein the Younger, detail of the The Ambassadors, oil on panel, 811/2 x 82V2 in, 1533. Anamorphic skull as seen from its 'corrected' vantage point. To see this undistorted version of the skull, close one eye and view the elongated image in the bottom part of Fig. 1 from an oblique angle, above and to the right of the figure. (Courtesy of the National Gallery, London) 'authors' who continue to make work) has been how to reinforce the identity of the observer while encoding observer- directed messages (celebratory, critical, propagandistic) in the form of an ob- ject that is very much 'present'. One solution was arrived at by Minimalist sculptors who managed to suppress the referential and informational aspects of the object to such a point that the question of "what is it?" (the usual per- ceptual trap) was replaced by "what am I seeing/experiencing?" Such a tactic refocused attention away from the object-qua-object and toward the rela- tionship of the observer to the object. It is in this new-found relationship that issues such as observer position, context and the phenomenology of materials become foregrounded in considerations as to what an object might 'mean'. THE ILLICIT KEYHOLE The absolute specificity of the position of the observer (or mediating device) necessary for the appreciation of anamorphic projections privileges a single viewpoint-a viewpoint that is special, fleeting and perhaps difficult to attain. This is not the stuff of mass media. Nor, given the inherent awk- wardness of viewer position, does anamorphosis lend itself readily to casual contemplation, let alone medita- tion. It is not the kind of image one can dwell upon; rather, it is like something seen out of the corner of the eye, glimpsed at high speed or seen through a keyhole. As a result, any content or image buried in the anamorphosis seems (to borrow a word from Freud) 'uncanny', perhaps even illicit. The effect has been widely used to surreptitiously depict subjects one might otherwise be reluctant to rep- resent: the erotic, the scatological, the occult, the religious, the politically controversial and the philosophically abstruse (Figs 2, 3) [16]. While the use of anamorphosis for more conven- tional subjects is well documented [ 17], this 'secret discourse' is ideally suited for the depiction of difficult or illicit subject matter [18]. That the anamor- phosis is hidden, only occasionally re- vealed-the unexpected view of some- thing private from an unwittingly privileged point of view-places it in a category of experience that is at once magical and taboo. Why magical? Be- cause magic is the power to control one's perception of events-"now you see it, now you don't". And why taboo? Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer 77</page><page sequence="6">Because there are few models of vision that explicitly place the percipient in the role of creating her own experience. Such a case stands outside of the 'nor- mal' ways art events are received-in which the percipient is implicitly de- fined as a passive consumer of a fully articulated aesthetic object. Marcel Du- champ certainly understood the per- verse excitement (and the boredom) of the eccentric observer and the frisson generated by the privileged view: Con- sider his last, great work, Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas (1946- 1966), in which an eroticized, mildly anamorphic and androgynous nude can be seen only through peepholes cut into a crude doorway. In this work the viewer occupies the vantage point of a voyeur who must commit (to) the act of seeing [19]. The taboos on sensory indulgence cut across the entire sensory apparatus and are one of many ways we uncon- sciously animate everyday speech. One steals a glance, sneaks a kiss, cops a feel, catches a whiff, overhears a remark-all for what? To heighten the effect of sensory experience. The classic example, of course, is that of the voyeur who actively seeks an illicit point of view in order to heighten sexual experience. More interesting perhaps is Barthes's notion of a 'gape in the garment' that, for an instant, frames a view that is similarly illicit, slightly taboo and, there- fore, completely erotic. Barthes writes in The Pleasure of the Text: "Is not the most erotic portion of a body where the gar- ment gapes? ... It is intermittence, as psychoanalysis has so rightly stated, which is erotic: the intermittence of skin flash- ing between two articles ofclothing" [20]. In Structuralism and Semiotics, Terence Hawkes offers an outline of Barthes's distinction between the 'writerly text' and the 'readerly text' that gives an idea of the active role Barthes envisions for the reader. The writerly text, according to Hawkes, "gives the reader a role, a function, a contribution to make.... [The readerly text] renders the reader idle or redundant, 'left with no more than the poor freedom either to accept or reject the text' [21], [thereby reduc- ing him] to that apt but impotent sym- bol of the bourgeois world, an inert consumer to the author's role as pro- ducer" [22]. Hawkes goes on to quote Barthes's description of the writerly text at length-a text we shall see involves 'two kinds of pleasure': Text of pleasure: the text that con- tents, fills, grants euphoria; the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a comfortable practice of reading. Text of bliss: the text that imposes a state of loss, the text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a certain bore- dom), unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories, brings to a crisis his relation with language [23]. Do not certain sensory events-apart from language-produce similar effects? Could we not speak of the 'image' or the 'taste' or the 'smell' or the 'sound' that "contents, fills, grants euphoria" or "imposes a state of loss", and so forth? More specifically, is not the experience of an anamorphic projection a kind of 'text of bliss'-an image that literally requires the loss of the previous read- ing to be seen; an image that physically discomforts the viewer by the awkward- ness of its vantage point; an image that flies in the face of conventional rules of taste and design; and, finally, an image that ignores the usual assumptions about perception and appreciation and 'brings to a crisis' a viewer's relation- ship with the art experience? Though nothing more than a tool for the artist, anamorphosis can provide the impetus for precisely this kind of rupture in the text and lend to the reader/observer a special role, an active function-in a word, an identity. PEELING THE ANAMORPHIC ONION Admittedly, this identity may only be a projection of the artist. Still, we can ask the question (tongue in cheek): "What do observers want?" Given the fact that one set of operations (e. g. paint spread upon a support) can lead to quite different interpretative ends, the question of a hierarchy of inter- pretation is raised. Is one reading more accurate, more astute, more desirable? If the text really is "a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture" (as Barthes declares [24]), our observer has her work cut out for her. Certainly, if an observer failed to find the iconic rendering buried within the distorted lines of the anamorphosis, the possible interpretations become limited to the metaphorical meander- ings possible from half the information. Assuming an observer unlocks the vari- ous possible ways of engaging the piece-materially, symbolically, meta- phorically, etc.-is it fair to say that to glimpse the image behind the distorted projection is to render other meanings secondary? It is true that the anamor- phic image, seen only obliquely and through one eye, tends to elevate every distortion, every abstracted, non- objective gesture to a new plane-one in which meaning is not merely a func- tion of interpretation but hinges upon, literally, point of view. (Of course, to question the viability of one's vantage point already is to function beyond simple interpretation. One need not become involved with anamorphosis to understand this.) But as we have sug- gested the process is a dynamic and ever-changing one. One does not leave the room with one idea-rather, one leaves the room (perhaps repeatedly) with many ideas, some of which are in conflict. In discussing the 'ana- morphic' qualities of the Athenian Acropolis, Donald Preziosi writes: Any articulated intervention into a given visual environment induces al- tered relationships among such ele- ments, causing them to be re-narra- tivized or reread: to be seen differently. What results is a picture of a visual environment as a dynamically unfold- ing, fluid, rhetorical stage, filled with revelations and occlusions, lucidities and undecidabilities. All tableaux are momentary and transitory; any genius loci is migratory, always subject to cri- tique. Meaning is continually subject to displacement and deferral, and sub- jects are always subject to such dis- placements and migratory fixities: sub- jectivity, like objecthood, is a fictitious fact; a dialectical and ideological nego- tiation, a provisional homestead [25]. Preziosi's remarks notwithstanding, it may well be important to consider whether the extended range of pos- sibility offered by the use of anamor- phosis-or any other technique that addresses the dynamic and subjective character of the subject-is sufficient to justify rethinking the way in which works of art are encountered. The im- portance of recognizing the processes involved in perception and appre- ciation is discussed by Arnheim in his seminal work Visual Thinking, written in 1967, in which he considers the viewing subject's ability to find "the appropriate range of a problem as almost tanta- mount to finding its solution" [26]. What status do our conventional categories of observer and object pos- sess when applied to anamorphic pro- jection? As the question "what is it?" is only answerable by occupying a partic- ular vantage point, the usual leap into the seduction of recognizable imagery or narrative concern is deferred. The observer must necessarily encounter the anamorphosis as something ele- 78 Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer</page><page sequence="7">mental-materials on a surface, a skin perhaps. These materials strain in the mind's eye to engender meaning-but if anything presents itself beyond paint and process, it is usually a kind of ab- stracted metaphor or symbol. It is only when the observer occupies the 'cor- rect' position relative to the anamor- phosis-peeling back that final layer- that the 'secret' identity of the object is learned (Fig. 4). This sequence of per- ception, in effect, reverses the pattern of reading a conventional represen- tational work of art in which the recog- nition of an image is followed first by a consideration of metaphorical or sym- bolic intention and finally by an analysis of the materials and processes em- ployed by the artist. This does not suggest that perceiving and appreciating works of art can be reduced to a linear procedure. In fact, there is a cycle of reading that often occurs when encountering works of anamorphic art that involves a return to the 'traditional' vantage point. This re- turn is enriched by the journey of the observer through a range of (either) actual or metaphorical repositionings in which multiple and conflicting views concatenate to create a larger effect. This is not unrelated, I expect, to how other 'tricks' employed by artists- anthropomorphism for example-op- erate to complicate and deepen the read- ing of the work. The appreciation of anamorphosis in art is also akin to works Fig. 4. Daniel L. Collins, Semiotics in Paradise (The Absence of Eve), mixed-media wall installation with dosed- circuit video, 1990. In this anamorphic wall drawing (above), Eve is released of the burden of Paradise. The view shown in this photo- graph appears exheinely distorted. When viewed from the video camera's angle (shown above and to the right of the anamorphic wall draw- ing), the image be- comes recognizable. This closed-circuit video camera presents the restored image of Eve on a small monitor.

This analogy holds despite the fact that the anamor- phosis may contain highly specific rep- resentational imagery. If I look at a traditional representational painting- a still-life painting by Chardin, for ex- ample-in all likelihood I will perceive the objects being represented by the artist before attending to the qualities of paint or the formal devices that organize the picture. Typically, when approaching an anamorphic projec- tion, an observer will have considered the metaphoric and material aspects of an image previous to focusing in on a recognizable image. While it is clear enough that appreciating any work of art cannot be boiled down to a predictive sequence, it needs to be Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer 79</page><page sequence="8">acknowledged that works involving anamorphosis necessitate a surpris- ing-and perhaps broader-range of responses from the observer. As a case in point, consider this lively description offered by Lacan regarding the process of discerning the anamor- phosis (a distorted skull) in Holbein's painting The Ambassadors (see Figs 2 and 3) [27]: What, then, before this display of the domain of appearance in all its most fascinating forms, is this object, which from some angles appears to be flying through the air, at others to be tilted? You cannot know-for you turn away, thus escaping the fascination of the picture. Begin by walking out of the room in which no doubt it has long held your attention. It is then that, turning around as you leave-as the author of the Anamorphoses describes it-you apprehend in this form.... What? A skull. This is not how it is presented at first-that figure, which the author compares to a cuttlebone and which for me suggests rather that loaf composed of two books which Dali was once pleased to place on the head of an old woman, chosen deliberately for her wretched, filthy appearance and, indeed, because she seems to be unaware of the fact, or, again, Dali's soft watches, whose signification is ob- viously less phallic than that of the object depicted in a flying position in the foreground of this picture [28]. This is a process that demands an active (and eccentric) observer. By ac- tively engaging in this (hermeneutical) process, in which the subject stands on par with the object, the identity of the viewing subject is reinforced and re- affirmed. Far from 'losing' herself in the art experience, the viewer of the anamorphosis-or, more exactly, the participation of the viewer-becomes a significant feature of the exchange. What is the nature of this participation and why should it interest us? AN OBLIQUE LOOK AT JACQUES LACAN AND PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY There is a reason for introducing psy- choanalytic theory at this point in the argument. But let us quickly retrace our steps: I began by briefly describing clas- sical perspective theory, which posits a symmetrical relationship between the observing subject and the object of the gaze. I then argued for the primacy of an observing subject (in my termi- nology, the eccentric observer) rooted in a 'subjective vision' of the world. Proceeding from theories of vision, an analogy between visual perception and reading was made. Here the 'divided' character of reading described by Sartre and others was invoked to suggest that visual appreciation depends upon ac- tive observing (a kind of reading) rather than passive looking. If one agrees that the problem of viewing (aes- thetic) objects ultimately hinges upon the role played by the observing subject (a particular 'point of view'), one may conclude that the literature of psycho- analysis is of some interest. In the work of the French neo-Freudian Lacan, several of these diverse threads come together (or perhaps unravel). Lacan, in TheFourFundamentals of Psy- choanalysis, interprets the anamorphosis in Holbein's The Ambassadors first as a phallic image (when encountered head-on), then as a skull (the image 'buried' in the anamorphosis), and finally as 'a trap for the gaze' in which the observer 'apprehends' herself- that is, sees herself seeing herself. He likens this self-reflexive act to the turn- ing inside-out of the finger of a winter glove, in which the fur that was once the exterior surface becomes its interior surface. "Consciousness", says Lacan, "in its illusion of seeing itself seeing itself, finds its basis in the inside-out structure of the gaze" [29]. What this suggests-and what the experience of anamorphic projections (and certain other classes of perceptual illusion) tends to bring out-is that the functions of perception are never simply about negotiating the physical world; rather, they are about the appre- hension-and the making-of the self. When an observer gazes upon the world of things, the self of the observer is not lost in the construction of the object; instead, the observer is brought into being as a function of the gaze [30]. Lacan sees the viewing subject-our observer-as simultaneously negotiat- ing an outside world structured as a system of signs and an inside world con- trolled by certain primordial anxieties. 'The unconscious is structured like a language," says Lacan at the beginning of one of his seminars [31]. Language, for Lacan, becomes a metaphor use- ful in revealing the psychological pro- cesses of the subject. Lacan's contribution to psychoana- lytic theory exists less as a series of clini- cal 'proofs' (though he was a practicing psychoanalyst throughout his career) than as a philosophy of psychoanalysis. His most revolutionary insights con- cern how meaning is produced. Ac- cording to Ellie Ragland-Sullivan, a Lacanian scholar at the University of Illinois, "[Lacan] taught us that con- sciousness is not consciousness of some- thing, but is a mode of perception that negotiates unconscious desire and repression by substitutions ... one sub- stitution being language itself, and another being meaning" [32]. A 'neo-Freudian' (with certain major provisos), Lacan reinterpreted Freud's four fundamental concepts of psycho- analysis. Drive appears in Lacan's work as a combination of need, desire and demand. The unconscious becomes the 'discourse' and desire of the other. Re- petition is a key to personal 'identity'. Transferencesets the unconscious in mo- tion through 'specular' relations [33]. The starting point for Lacan is the mother-infant dyad. Up until the about the eighteenth month, the identity of the baby is still inextricably linked-is at one-with the mother, the primary provider of physical and psychic sus- tenance. In this pre-literate stage the baby has notyet experienced the appre- hension of self-the dawn of inde- pendent consciousness-that will allow it (require it) to acknowledge a differ- ence between the self and the other (in this case, the mother). The unity of the self at this stage, for Lacan, is symbol- ically represented by the phallic sig- nifier. At the moment the baby achieves a sense of self-a complex process of self-awareness that Lacan discusses in the pre-mirror stage and the mirror stage-the phallic signifier (the baby, irrespective of gender) is symbolically castrated-that is, literally and figura- tively split from its unifying sense of self. In the ensuing efforts to regain the paradise lost at the breast of the mother, the infant substitutes symbolic and cultural functions (such as lan- guage) in compensation for the loss of the primary, unitary self [34]. Ragland-Sullivan writes: "Lacan has argued that the body experiences the psychic pain of division and alienation (which the impact of separation first caused) as Castration or primordial anxiety. This drama gives rise to the use of language as substitutive energy (sec- ondary libido), in compensation for re- pressing a primordial Desire for con- stancy or Oneness (primary libido)" [35]. Elsewhere she writes, "The phallic injunction to separation or differentia- tion creates repression by pushing an infant into the world of language" [36]. Let us return to the anamorphosis in the Holbein painting. For Lacan, the glimpse of 'death's head' in the painting would be more than simply a 'secret perspective' revealing a 80 Collins, Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer</page><page sequence="9">(cliched) momento moni; rather, it would be a mnemonic device providing in- sights into the primordial realm. Wit- nessing the anamorphosis, several 'readings' occur simultaneously: the memory of the phallic signifier; the dis- location or removal of the self from the proper viewing position at stage cen- ter-that is, a re-enactment of the primordial anxiety of castration; and, finally, a view of the void-of death itself. But the special excitement cre- ated in the apprehension of this death's head is the knowledge that only one very much alive could unpeel these multiple layers. Lacan's theories are, needless to say, controversial. In recent years his work has come increasingly under attack by everyone from strict Freudians to radi- cal feminists. Still, I believe that even his detractors would admit that his project does build a kind of bridge between, say, a phenomenology of the body and the disembodied abstractions of linguistic theory. The central roles he affords the terms 'phallic signifier' and 'castration' may be off-putting until one understands the multiple signifi- cances of such terminology; it is really between the layers of reference that the spirit of his work resides. Lacan writes in his essay, "The Freudian Thing": A truth, it must be admitted, is not easy to recognize, once it has become accepted. Not that there are not estab- lished truths, but they then become so easily confused with the reality that surrounds them that no other artifice has yet been found to distinguish them from it than to mark them with the sign of the spirit, to pay them homage, to regard them as coming from another world [37]. Irrespective of the reception of Lacan's larger theoretical position, his treatment of anamorphosis as an at- tempt to explain the complex relation- ship of the observer to the problems of vision, specifically in the construction of the gaze, has stimulated discussion by several authors since the first version of this essay in 1987. I1 need to stress that with Lacan we have left the 'perceptu- alism' of classical modern art history (Gombrich, Arnheim et al) [38] and are looking at anamorphosis as a kind of metaphor for the decentering of the self through the experience of art (or, in the case of Lacan, psychoanalysis). Norman Bryson, in discussing the anamorphic skull that cuts across and disrupts the logical field occupied by Holbein's ambassadors, makes a clean analogy between the visual world of painting and the language of Lacanian psychoanalysis: The effect of this insertion of the screen, or skull, or scotoma, is that the subject who sees is no more the center of the visual experience than the sub- ject of language is at the center of speech.... It may be the case that I feel myself to inhabit some kind of center in my speech, but what decenters me is the network of language.... Psycho- analysis is that experience of speaking on the field of the other. The analy- sand does not stand at the center of control over these motions of the sig- nifier; he or she is more like their be- wildered observer. Lacan's analysis of vision unfolds in the same terms: the viewing subject does not stand at the center of a perceptual horizon, and cannot command the chains and series of signifiers passing across the visual domain. Vision unfolds to the side of, in tangent to, the field of the other. And to that form of seeing Lacan gives a name: seeing on the field of the other, seeing under the Gaze [39]. While Bryson finds Lacan's account of visuality as "historically extremely im- portant" he is also disturbed by what he terms "a certain paranoid coloration". He writes: "Let us say that it is a bit easier, since Lacan, to think of visuality as something built cooperatively, over time; that we are therefore responsible for it, ethically accountable. Yet Lacan seems to me, at least, to view the sub- ject's entry into the social arena of visu- ality as intrinsically disastrous: the vo- cabulary is one of capture, annexation, death" [40]. In contrast to Lacan's inherently dark world in which a protest is mounted to the decentering of the sub- ject, Bryson offers the alternative of acceptance. Using examples drawn from Eastern philosophy and painting, Bry- son suggests that beyond the partial displacement of the subject that occurs in the work of Lacan (and of Sartre), a certain strain of thought in the work of the Japanese philosopher Nishida and his follower Nishitani represents a much more radical decentering of the subject. Based in the concept of sunyata (emptiness, radical impermanence, blankness, nihilism) this conception maintains that the framing processes endemic to Western accounts of per- ception are artificially imposed and bound up in static readings of culture and history. If visuality in the West is, as Bryson argues, "preserved by an optic that casts around each entity a percep- tual frame that makes a cut from the field and immobilizes the cut within the static framework", then this Eastern conception would characterize the ob- ject as existing "as part of a mobile continuum that cannot be cut any- where" [41]. CODA Anamorphosis serves to throw into re- lief the perceptual and psychological matrix surrounding works of art. This 'secret perspective' should be viewed less as an assault on the field of vision than as a supplement-a series of oblique nuances, mind-bending vistas and disturbing cuts in the otherwise uniform, homogenous pattern (of be- havior) that we carry both as a comfort and as a burden. It is in these 'wrinkles in the field' that an opportunity for giving expression to those things that stand to the side, that have been literally and figuratively marginalized, is found. Anamorphosis is a technique for bringing that which still remains outside of the field of the gaze into the line of sight and into consciousness. In part two of this paper (following in the next regular issue of Leonardo), I will trace the modern uses of anamor- phosis, ranging from the invention of anamorphic (concave sphero-cylindri- cal) lenses in the early nineteenth cen- tury to contemporary, computer-based anamorphic applications. A range of anamorphic effects in the works of con- temporary artists-including examples of my own work-will be illustrated and discussed. References and Notes 1. Jurgis Baltrusaitis, Anamorphic Art (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1977). Certainly many examples exist from antiquity in which the peculiarities of human vision were overcome by conscious design. Baltrusaitis references Plato in the Sophist: "Works which, considered from a favourable viewing-point, resemble the beautiful but which, properly ex- amined, no longer offer the resemblance they pro- mised, are phantoms." In the same passage Bal- trusaitis goes on to discuss the Roman architect Vitruvius: "Vitruvius echoed this reasoning and drew practical conclusions from it. Since what is true appears false and things seem different from what they are, in representing them we must add or subtract. In the case of an architectural facade, this involves replacing straight lines by curves, thickening, raising and inclining certain parts. Columns swell in the middle, their bases bulge, corner columns swell (by a fiftieth part of their diameter), architraves lean forward (by a twelfth part of their height)." While these adjustments are made 'to remedy the errors of vision', it is not until the Renaissance that some effort was made to account for them mathe- matically. Baltrusaitis writes: "The meeting be- tw, n the arts and sciences in fact took place in Italy in the first half of the fifteenth century (Ghiberti, Alberti). It produced a wonderful flowering: Piero della Francesca (1469), Leonardo da Vinci (1492) ,Jean Pelerin, called Viator (1505), Dfirer (1525), Vignola (1530-40), Serlio (1545), Barbaro (1559), Cousin (1560), all of whom ap- plied mathematical theories methodically and elaborated procedures for dealing with all possible forms."

Press, 1989). This English edi- tion is an expanded version of the original Italian title: OperaAperta (Milan: Bompiani, 1962). Eco, in articulating the domain of his 'open work', touches upon the idea of subjective vision: "The force of the subjective element in the interpretation of a work of art (any interpretation implies an interplay be- tween the addressee and the work as an objective fact) was noticed by classical writers, especially when they set themselves to consider the figurative arts. In the Sophist, Plato observes that painters suggest proportions not by following some objec- tive canon but by judging them in relation to the angle from which they are seen by the observer. Vitruvius makes a distinction between 'symmetry' and 'eurhythmy', meaning by this latter term an adjustment of objective proportions to the require- ments of a subjective vision. The scientific and practical development of the technique of perspec- tive bears witness to the gradual maturation of this awareness of an interpretative subjectivity pitted against the work of art. Yet it is equally certain that this awareness has led to a tendency to operate against the 'openness' of the work, to favor its 'closing out'. The various devices of perspective were just so many different concessions to the actual location of the observer in order to ensure that he looked at the figure in the only possible right way -that is, the way the author of the work had prescribed, by providing various visual devices on which the observer's attention can focus. 6.

My concept of 'invisible intervention' finds a certain resonance with the comments of Patrick A. Heelan, a philosophy instructor at the State Uni- versity of New York at Stony Brook, who speaks of the 'transparent' qualities of certain modes of ac- quiring or expressing information in which "inter- mediaries (information 1) in the acquisition or expression of information (information 2) 'drop out of consciousness'". Heelan goes on to write: "It is commonplace, however, that many processes perfected through the painful process of learning share this characteristic, that intermediaries drop out of consciousness. The paradigm example is reading, but there are other processes that are similar, such as playing a musical instrument, sight- reading music, driving a car, and reading an instru- ment: to a suitably experienced person processes like these have 'the same subjective ease and imme- diacy as the simplest perceptions'".

Dada artist George Grosz, for example, describing his work in collage, stated that his early work in 1916 was cut up and assembled "in such a way as to say, in pictures, what would have been banned by the censors if we had said it in words".

D'Harnoncourt and Hopps write: "One section of The Large Glasshas perhaps undergone the most direct and witty transformation in the mise-en- scene of Etant Donnes .... The delicate, silvered patterns on the Glass, just below the 'horizon', which represent the Oculist Witnesses observing the stripping of the Bride, now become ourselves- stooping or stretching to peer through the holes in the old wooden door. As in To be looked at with one eye, close, to, for almost an hour, the small glass study of 1918 in which a magnifying glass is glued onto the pane, in effect, Duchamp requires the viewer to become a voyeur. To look at To be looked at .., or, more pointedly, to look at Etant Donnes... is to catch oneself in the posture of a Peeping Tom. It is Duchamp's ironic and brilliant achievement in this new work to have transferred the responsibility for whatever erotic interpretation it provokes from the impartial facts of the assemblage itself to the eye of the beholder." 20.

See Leeman et al [4] p. 59, for the following information on the painting: "When Holbein painted this lifesize double portrait of Jean de Dinteville, the French Ambassador, and his friend, Bishop Georges de Selve, in England, he sur- rounded them with attributes that could be inter- preted in various ways. The highly detailed still lifes in the center show the interests of both friends, yet at the same time refer to the transitory nature of human endeavors. The crucifix just barely visible beyond the drapery at upper left sustains this theme. The elongated form in the lower fore- ground pierces the painterly illusion and makes it relative. For when one looks at it from above at the right, it is seen to be a skull." 28. Jacques Lacan, The FourFundamentals of Psycho- analysis (New York: W. W. Norton, 1981) p. 88.

See also Heelan [13] pp. 9-10. One need not read Lacan to find an endorsement of such a posi- tion. Heelan writes from his vantage point as a philosopher of science: 'The perceived object is experienced as being given to human experience, and it is normally accepted spontaneously without any reflective question having been raised and considered about the possible source in the subject of that recognition and acceptance. Husserl calls this attitude 'the natural attitude'. This is the atti- tude that supposes thatwe can gaze on a World with an 'innocent eye', and that what we find unex- amined in this way is real and as such privileged. "In contrast to the natural attitude is the reflec- tive-transcendental attitude-or simply what I shall call 'the reflective attitude'; that is accompanied by an awareness of the role that the subject plays in knowing, through preparatory intentions that pre- figure in our expectations, the horizons that 'speak' to us. A perceptual object, for example, is given not atomically as an isolated experience un- connected with anything else, but as fulfilling cer- tain enabling conditions, such as being located in time and space among the things and situations that comprise a World." 31.
