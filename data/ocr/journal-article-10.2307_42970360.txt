R. Lucas : Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus Mary Hesse : Ramifications of Grue The article investigates certain forms of Goodman's "grue" paradox. Two prin- ciples for setting up the paradox are adopted: that it is essentially a paradox about prediction, and that needless asymmetries must be eliminated from its initial state- ment. It is argued that Goodman is correct in holding that no syntactic or semantic asymmetries can be appealed to in choosing between the predictions of "green" and "grue", but wrong in looking to entrenchment to determine this choice. Instead the required asymmetry is to be found in the possibility of stating a total and simple physical theory involving these predicates. J. L. Mackie : The Relevance Criterion of Confirmation This criterion in its basic form says that an hypothesis is confirmed by an observation if and only if the adding of the hypothesis to the background knowledge raises the probability of what is observed. There are also two comparative forms of the criterion, and several proposed measures of the degree of confirmation incorpo- rate it. Though it is plausible anid widely accepted, Hooker and Stove have said that arguments for it are lacking. The criterion is defended a posteriori by showing that it agrees with otherwise acceptable judgements; arguments against it are exam ined; it is concluded that it is a sound criterion of the direct confirmation of explanatory hypotheses, but not of non-deductive support in general. Several kinds of non-deductive support are distinguished; it is argued that no one criterion or measure applies to them all. Finally an a priori justification is sketched for this as a criterion of direct confirmation. Patricia Baillie : That confirmation may yet be a Probability In an example discussed in Appendix 9 of "Logic of Scientific Discovery", Popper takes as given, a certain criterion of classificatory confirmation, the Relevance Criterion, and the direct interpretation of probability as degree of confirmation. The direct interpretation is then supposedly refuted by a reductio ad absurdum argument. But the reductio can be shown to depend on a premise which is not entailed by the direct interpretation, or by the Relevance Criterion, or by their conjunction. This hidden premise is the explication of a concept of comparative confirmation. Clarifi- cation of the use of this premise shows that the contentious conclusion is either derivable and not self-contradictory, or self -contradictory, but not derivable. So we can quite comfortably hold both the direct interpretation and the Relevance Criterion, simply by defining a comparison of confirmation relations, which is applicable to the case in question, and is in general a useful concept.

Ruse : Definitions of Species in Biology Two different definitions have been proposed for species in biology, one based on interbreeding and reproductive isolation, and the other on morphological charac- teristics. Various arguments purporting to show the superiority of the former definition are examined and found wanting. It is argued that the solution to a problem is to be found by considering why scientists are prepared to call concepts 'real'; this being that they can provide alternative, logically independent definitions of the concepts, and that these definitions can be linked by laws. Such alternative definitions can be given for species defined by reproductive criteria, but are lacking for most other cases. E. J. Craig : Phenomenal Geometry Henry Byerly : Model-Structures and Model-Objects Two aspects of talk about models in science are examined: reference to mathe- matical structures and reference to objects which exhibit those structures. Extension of knowledge by imputation of structure is distinguished from analogical extension in terms of similarities of descriptive properties and relations. The terms 'model- structure* and 'model-object' are used to bring into focus the role in scientific theories of the descriptive content of mod el- objects as a ground for causal relationships over and above the logical-mathematical structures. Vol. 20 , No. 3, 1969 James Car gilè : The Sorites Paradox The Sorites Paradox involves the application of reasoning by mathematical induction to ordinary language predicates. One response would be to reject these applications. I argue that this is unacceptable, on the grounds that very basic logical assumptions which are plausible even for the loosest and most informal ordinary language sentences are enough to entail the objectionable inductive arguments. I suggest two ways of accepting the paradoxical results, one involving the assumption that vague terms have boundaries which are just unknown, the other based on the idea we may, in applying logic to language, have to arbitrarily set boundaries for vague terms. Adolf Grünbaum : Can an infinitude of operations be performed in a finite time ? An affirmative but multiply qualified answer is given to the question "Is it kinematically possible for a classically moving body to perform an infinite sequence of operations in a finite time?" A run made intermittent by a denumerable infinity of suitably decreasing pauses of rest serves as the prototype of such a sequence. This staccato run is claimed to be of finite duration, being such that all of its time- derivatives vary continuously throughout its performance. And it is argued that kinematically such a denumerable infinity of distinct operations is not beset by Zeno' s paradoxes, any more than the corresponding uninterrupted run of Achilles. Paul Teller : Goodmans Theory of Projection This paper first outlines Goodman's theory of projection emphasizing Goodman's important but often overlooked characterization of projectibility as a matter of degree. Next, the paper present several difficulties, particularly in Goodman's appeal to overhypotheses as a means of mediating indirect evidence. Finally, it is argued that the tenable residue of Goodman's theory is compatible with a Bayesian version of confirmation theory in which the problem of choosing a prior probability function is identified with the problem of deciding the projectibility of hypotheses.</page><page sequence="6">Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science' 331 Roland Puccetti : The sensation of pleasure Many philosophers have followed Gilbert Ryl e in denying pleasure the status of a sensation because, unlike pain, it is not separable from its source, a cause or effect, dockable or locatable or describable. However experiments in psychobiology beginning some 15 years ago show there are specific pleasure centres in the mammalian brain which, when artificially stimulated by electrodes, produce behaviour patterns inex- plicable except on the interpretation of pleasure sensations occurring to the subject. How these are separable from their source, both cause and effect, dockable and locatable and describable. The extrapolation to humans and reported results with human subjects. How this may be taken as an example of the limitations of ordinarv language philosophy. Walter Hoering : Indeterminism in Classical Physics The concepts of indeterminism, which can be extracted from the works of Liapunov 1893, Popper 1950, Born 1955 and Brillouin 1956/64 are made explicit and compared. For each of the concepts obtained it is possible to define, in the frame- work of classical mechanics, models, which are ¡»deterministic in that sense. The question of indeterminism of a given model depends moreover on the kind of ques- tions admitted. Quite generally: Any mechanics suitable for the description of models of decisions (partions of a continuum of trajectories into two or more physically distinct classes) is seen to lead to indeterminism for these very models. Vol 20 , No . 4 , 1969 Ian Mueller : Euclid's Elements and the Axiomatic Method Certain historians of mathematics have rejected the nineteenth-century charac- terization of Euclid's Elements as intuitive rather than logical. Building upon this rejection, A. Szabó has speculated concerning the influence of Greek philosophy on the historical development of mathematics. A careful statement of the differences between the Elements and its modern successors shows the essential correctness of the nineteenth-century characterization and the superfluity of Szabó's speculations for understanding the history of mathematics. In particular, the evolution of the axiomatic method and the Greek conception of the relationship of arithmetic and geometry are explained without resort to complicated conjectures. C. West Churchman and Bruce G. Buchanan : On the design of inductive sys- tems: some philosophical problems The concept of an inductive system is introduced as that of a teleological entity which formulates and tests explanatory hypotheses. Various philosophical problems arise with the question of how to design an inductive system that performs this task rationally. When viewing the process of induction in this way the fundamental pro- blems include finding criteria of success for the whole system and for the component parts and finding criteria for deciding between alternative designs. From one example followed in detail it is suggested that it is unlikely that a rational design of an inductive system can be found at all. Kenneth F. Schaffner : The Watson-Crick Model and Reductionism This paper examines some of the issues connected with the problem of reducing biology to physics and chemistry. The approach is made through the history of molecular genetics, in particular focusing on the implications for molecular biology of the Watson-Crick model of DNA. The nature of reduction in the physical sciences is reexamined in connection with an optics-electromagnetic theory example, new analyses of scientific theory and "correspondence rule'' are suggested, and the neces- sary and sufficent conditions for reduction discoverable here are applied in the context of the molecular genetics of the 1950s and 460's. Contributions of biologists connected with semi-conservative replication, protein synthesis, genetic fine structure, the genetic code, and cell differentiation are discussed. Finally, some of the problems specific to the reduction of biology are examined, and a general biological principle of reduction is stated.</page><page sequence="7">332 Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science* Vol 36, March , 1969 A panel discussion of simultaneity by slow clock transport in the special and general theories of relativity Adolf Grünbaum and Wesley C. Salmon: Introduction: The context of these essays Adolf Grünbaum: Simultaneity by slow clock transport in the special theory of relativity Wesley C. Salmon: The conventionality of simultaneity After describing a new method of synchronizing spatially separated clocks by means of clock transport, this paper discusses the philosophical import of the exist- ence of such methods, including those of Ellis and Bowman .and of Bridgman, with special reference to the Ellis-Bowman claim that "the thesis of the conventionality of distant simultaneity... is thus either trivialized or refuted." I argue that the physical facts do not support this philosophical conclusion, and that a substantial part of their argument against Reichenbach, in particular, is misdirected. Finally, I suggest that Ellis and Bowman employ seriously unclear notions of triviality and "good physical reasons" that tend to obscure rather than clarify the basic philosoph- ical issues. An objective criterion of nontriviality of conventions is advanced. Bas C. van Fraassen: Conventionality in the axiomatic foundations of the special theory of relativity In this paper we examine Ellis and Bowman's argument, that simultaneity in inertial frames of reference is not conventional, from the axiomatic point of view. In Part I we examiqe the role of conventions in an axiomatic physical theory, and in Part II the relation of simultaneity in Reichenbach's axiomatization of the space- time theory of special relativity. Allen I. Janis: Synchronism by slow transport of clocks in noninertial frames of reference The demonstration that slow transport of clocks can be used to define simultaneity in inertial frames of reference leads to the question of whether clock transport can similarly be used in noninertial frames. It is shown that there are certain types of reference frames in which the clock-transport method cannot be used in a self-con- sistent manner. It is also shown that there are other types of noninertial frames in which the clock- transport method will succeed. The discussion includes noninertial frames in flat space-time as well as the case of curved space-times. Paul K. Feyerabend: On a recent critique of complementary: Part II June, 1969 Frederic Schick: Arrow* s proof and the logic of preference , This paper is a critique of Kenneth Arrow's thesis concerning the lobical impos- sibility of a constitution. I argue that one of the premises of Arrow's proof, that of the transitivity of indifference, is untenable. Several concepts of preference are introduced and counter- instances are offered to the transitivity of indifference defined along the standard lines in terms of these concepts. Alternate analyses of indifference in terms of preference are considered, and it is shown that these do not serve Arrow's purposes either. Finally, it is argued that in the single special case in which indif- ference could plausibly be held to be transitive, Arrow's thesis is innocuous. H. P. Krips: Two paradoxes in quantum mechanics The purpose of this paper is to resolve two paradoxes, which occur in quantum theory, by using the discussion of the theory of measurement presented in two earlier papers by the author [3], [4], [5], The two paradoxes discussed will be the Schrö- dinger cat paradox and the Einstein, Podolski, Rosen paradox [2]. An introductory section will be included which summarizes the relevant results from the author's pre- vious papers. Also a discussion will be made regarding the author's interpretation of the density operator.</page><page sequence="8">Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science' 333 John Corcoran: Three logical theories This study concerns logical systems considered as theories. By searching for the problems which the traditionally given systems may reasonably be intended to solve, we clarify the rationales for the adequacy criteria commonly applied to logical sys- tems. From this point of view there appear to be three basic types of logical systems: those concerned with logical truth; those concerned with logical truth and with logical consequence; and those concerned with deduction per se as well as with logical thruth and logical consequence. Adequacy criteria for systems of the first two types include: effectiveness, soundness, completeness, Post completeness, "strong soundness" and strong completeness. Consideration of a logical system as a theory of deduction leads us to attempt to formulate two adequacy criteria for systems of proofs. The first deals with the concept of rigor or "gaplessness" in proofs. The second is a completeness condition for a system of proofs. An historical note at the end of the paper suggests a remarkable parallel between the above hierarchy of systems and the actual historical development of this area of logic. Hillary Jay Kelley: Entropy of knowledge Entropy is proposed as a concept which in its broader scope can contribute to the study of the General Information System. This paper attempts to identify a few fundamental subconcepts and lemmas which will serve to facilitate further study of system order. The paper discusses: partitioning order into logical and arbitrary kinds; the relationship of order to pattern; and suggested approaches to evaluating and improving the General Information System.

Raffensperger: A strategy for planning basic research September , 1969 í. E. Hunt and W. A. Suchting: Force and u natural motion " Brian Ellis has argued that the assigning of forces is, in the final analysis, a matter of convention. This conclusion is backed by the premises (1) that forces and forces-effects are necessary and sufficient for each other, and (2) that the classifi- cation of some state of affairs as a force-effect is at least partly conventional. We argue that the first premise is false, that the second premise is ambiguous as between several senses of "conventional," and finally that he has not established that force- effects are conventional in the sense required for the conclusion he wishes to draw. Robert L. Causey: Derived measurement, dimensions , and dimensional analysis This paper presents a representational theory of derived physical measurements. The theory proceeds from a formal definition of a class of similar systems. It is shown that such a class of systems possesses a natural proportionality structure. A derived measure of a class of systems is defined to be a proportionality-preserving representation whose values are n-tuples of positive real numbers. Therefore, the de- rived measures are measures of entire physical systems. The theory provides an interpretation of the dimensional parameters in a large class of physical laws, and it accounts for the monomial dimensions of these parameters. It is also shown that a class of similar systems obeys a dimensionally invariant law, which one may safely subject to a dimensional analysis. Joseph S. Ullian: Is any set theory true ? This paper draws its title from the recent symposium of which it was part; it attempts to respond to the question raised by that title, taking current work in set theory into account. To this end the paper contrasts set theory with number theory, examines a severe brand of set-theoretic realism that is suggested by a passage</page><page sequence="9">334 Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science' from Godei, and sketches a first-order way of looking at the results about competing extensions of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. A formalistic sentiment may be detectable in some portions of the paper. Kenneth F. Schaffner: Correspondence rules The traditional role which correspondence rules, coordinating definitions, or semantical rules, have in a logical analysis of a scientific theory is questioned by providing an alternative analysis. The alternative account suggests that scientific theories are "meaningful" prior to the establisment of correspondence rules, and that correspondence rules are introduced to permit explanation and testing in the "obser- vational" sector. The role of models is briefly assessed in connection with this prior or "antecedent theoretical meaning," and a causal sequence analysis of a class of correspondence rules is presented which makes explicit the interdependence of scien- tific theories. Fred Wilson: Explanation in Aristotle , Newton, and Toulmin. Part I The claim that scientific explanation is deductive has been attacked on both systematic and historical grounds. This paper briefly defends the claim against the systematic attack. Essential to this defense is a distinction between perfect and im- perfect explanation. This distinction is then used to illuminate the differences and similarities between Aristotelian (anthropomorphic) explanations of certain facts and those of classical mechanics. In particular, it is argued that when one attempts to fit classical mechanics into the Aristotelian framework the latter becomes structurally incoherent. It is suggested that this, together with the fact that classical mechanics embodied the first piece of perfect knowledge, accounts, in part at least, for the historical fact of the rapid demise of the Aristotelian patterns as the new science developed. On the basis of this discussion, the inadequacies of the attack on the deductive model on historical grounds by Toulmin come to be seen. DISCUSSION Peter M. Williams: Goodman* s paradox and rules of acceptance DISCUSSION Bernard Suits: Games and paradox December , 1969 A PANEL DISCUSSION OF GRÜNBAUM'S PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE Gerald J. Massey: Toward a clarification of Griinbaum's conception of an intrinsic metric Much of Griinbaum's work may be regarded as a careful development and sys- tematic elaboration of the Riemann-Poincaré thesis of the conventionality of con- gruence, the thesis that the continuous manifolds of space, time, and space-time are intrinsically metrically amorphous, i.e. are devoid of intrinsic metrics. Therefore, to appreciate Grünbaum's philosophical contributions, one must have a clear under- standing of what he means by an intrinsic metric. The second and fourth sections of this paper are exegetical; in them we try to piece together, from his sundry remarks about intrinsic metrics, what Grünbaum means by the term 'intrinsic metric.' We shall argue that, the customary carefulness and precision of Grûnbaum's writings notwithstanding, there are residual unclarities and difficulties which beset his con- ception of an intrinsic metric. In the fifth section we shall propose an explication of Griinbaum's notion of an intrinsic metric which seems on the whole faithful to Griinbaum's intuitions and insights and which also seems capable of performing the philosophical services which his work demands of that notion. The third section is a digression on Zeno's metrical paradox of extension.</page><page sequence="10">Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science' 335 Bas C. van Fraassen: On Massey s explication of Grünbaum s conception of metric Professor Massey 's exposition and analysis [5] of Professor Griinbaum's writings on metric aspects of space seem to me both very helpful in understanding those writings and to contain a considerable original contribution to the subject. Never- theless I would like to argue that there is an alternative to Massey's explication which seems to me more faithful to Griinbaum's remarks: it seems at least to have the virtue of not forcing Grünbaum to reject the usual mathematical definitions of the notions used. Melbourne G. Evans: On the falsity of the Fitzgerald- Lor entz contraction hypothesis The Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, proposed as an explanation of the Michelson-Morley result, fails to account for the Kennedy-Thorndike result. Hence, Grünbaum argues, the hypothesis has been falsified. However, the contraction hypothesis as formulated by Lorentz is false for the very fundamental reason that it entails a contradiction, namely, the consequence that light waves must have a variable velocity along what by definition is taken to be a rest length. Furthermore, the attempt to resolve this contradiction by coupling the Fitz- gerald-Lorentz contraction with the hypothesis that clock rates are a function of velocity, is open to a sound, methodological objection. The Michelson-Morley result is fully satisfied, provided only that the lengths of the interferometer arms, in the longitudinal and transverse positions, are thought to be related to one another in a certain ratio, and this ratio may be interpreted as a contraction in both arms. Sincc this twofold contraction hypothesis suffices to explain both the Michelson-Morley and the Kennedy-Thorndike results, and since it entails no contradiction, there is no need to correct both the length of rods and the rate of clocks. Therefore, the combined clock-rod hypothesis, and with it the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, must be rejected. Robert Barrett: On the conclusive falsification of scientific hypotheses Adolf Grünbaum has introduced into the literature [4], and several times revised and restated [5] [6], a description of a putative crucial experiment. The outcome of this experiment is supposed to be the conclusive fasification of an hypo- thesis to the effect that the geometry of a certain region of space, or of a certain surface, is Euclidean. Hereafter, in this paper, I shall refer to this example experi- ment, in any and all of the different versions of it that Griinbaum has articulated, along with the argumentation with wich he has supplemented it, as "Griinbaum's Falsification Example:" I will be concerned with all versions of the experiment itself, but only with the most recent supplementary argumentation that Grünbaum has offered, since the ways in which this differs from earlier arguments reflect a taking into account, on Griinbaum's part, of points critics have raised and flaws that they have purported to find in some of those earlier arguments [7-11]. There are three separate important theses against which one or another version of Griinbaum's Falsification Example may be taken to have been directed. Each of these Griinbaum has either explicitly claimed to refute or at least left himself open to the interpretation that he has sought to refute, by means of the example. I propose to try to make clear that none cxf these three theses is refuted, or even threatened with counterevidence, by Griinbaum's Falsification Example. Gary Wedeking: Duhem, Quine and Griinbaum on falsification In Chapter 4 of [2] Griinbaum sets out to refute Einstein's philosophy of physical geometry. The latter's theory is seen as lying within the tradition of "anti- empiricist conventionalism" of Duhem and Quine as opposed to the "qualified empiri- cism" of Poincaré, Carnap and Reichenbach. Consequently Griinbaum sets the stage for his critique of Einstein by discussing certain of the views of these other thinkers. But in these preliminary discussions the various theses are confused and misrepresented in such a way as to make it almost impossible to evaluate Griin- baum's final treatment of Einstein's thesis. For this reason I will deal only with those parts of this chapter in which the roots of Griinbaum's confusion are to be found. This will involve analyses of two theories which are not clearly distinguished by Grünbaum. The first is Duhem's denial of the "crucial experiment" in physics: the second is Quine's version of "pragmatism".</page><page sequence="11">336 Abstracts from 'Philosophy of Science* Philip L.
