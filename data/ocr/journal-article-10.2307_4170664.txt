Celebrations of the Twelve Months (detail) Fenollosa-Weld Collection An Exhibition of Japanese Screens LANDSCAPES AND FIGURES A SPECIAL Exhibition of Japanese Screens of Birds, Flowers, and Animals which was held in 1935-1936 made it possible for the art loving public to see in Boston for the first time a large and related group of screen paintings. In 1936 the Loan Exhibi- tion of Art Treasures from Japan enabled one to realize, by comparison with significant works of art chosen from public and private collections in Japan, the high quality and importance of the Museum's perma- nent collection. From April 5 to May 22 there is to be held the second Exhibition of Japanese screens owned by the Museum. The selection is limited to Landscapes and Figures, but works of the Ukiyoe school are excluded and will be shown at some future time. Outstanding among the paintings in the present exhibition are two landscape screens which represent the tradition of ink monochrome painting of the Ashikaga period (1392-1568). The first is the "Eight Views at the Confluence of the Hsiao and Hsiang Rivers" by S6tan(?) (died 1481). The second is the "Chinese Landscapes" by T6gan (1 547-1 618) who, though he lived a century later, is here indebted to another fifteenth century artist, Sesshi (1420-1506), for the particular character- istics of his landscape style. In both these screens may be studied the idealistic point of view which dominated Japan in the fifteenth century and which caused a renaissance in Japan of the styles of art Itcho (1652-1724) of the Sung dynasty (960-1280) in China. That a Japanese artist should undertake to paint views of a certain region in China which he had never seen proves how subjective such painting is. In such a painting the realistic appearance is subordinated to the spiritual conception and the subject matter pro- duces an iconography of its own. The aspects to be represented elucidate a philosophical idea that nature and man manifest in common one life force. Hence, mountains and water are portrayed as sym- bols of complementary creative powers and man is shown amidst a vast natural setting in search of his natural purity. In Japan such a doctrinal art has always been closely associated with the teaching of the Zen sect and its best exponents, at least in the fifteenth century, were priests. It is as though in the realm of religious art there had been a transference from the worship of anthropomorphic diety to the worship of nature itself. In sharp contrast to this view of nature as expressed by artists of the Chinese school in Japan is the "Wave" screen, properly called "Matsushima," that view of pine-clad islets which constitutes one of the three famous views of Japan. In this screen by Korin ( 1 658-1 71 6) are displayed no quiet grada- tion of ink tones, no towering crags, nor banks of mist which speak to the contemplative soul. What K6rin pictures to us is an actual Japanese scene. To be sure, he stylized the design following that of his predecessor S6tatsu (died 1643?), but we can still appreciate the atmosphere of a particular locale. His representation in rich colors against a gold ground XXXVI, 24</page><page sequence="4">BULLETIN OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS Fig. 4. The Three Laughers Bigelow Collection Shohaku (I 1730-1783) appeals directly to our emotions. The K6etsu- Sotatsu tradition about the turn of the sixteenth cen- tury had gone back to the Yamatoe style of medieval Japan and had thereby revived the native tradition of colorful landscape painting. To this foundation Korin has added a quality of bold abstract design. This was new in his day, and even at the present time, when abstract art is greatly appreciated, his technique may still be regarded as masterly. If this landscape screen be contrasted with the preceding ones, the distinction between the "Chinese" and Japanese traditions is abundantly clear. A third approach to landscape painting is found in the pair of screens by Chokunyu (1814-1907), an artist who belonged to the "Literary" school which turned for its models to the later artists of China and which discovered among them a more personal and poetical style. The artists of this school are more individual in their expression. Not infrequently they compose poems to accompany their paintings. A poetic mood is to be achieved, and in so doing they often emphasize a more intimate or realistic view of nature than was usual in the older traditions of landscape painting. The approach to figure painting is equally diverse. Perhaps the most distinguished example is the pair of screens of "Po I and Shu Ch'i" (Fig. 1) and the "Four Sages of Mount Shang" (Fig. 2) by Kano Naonobu (1 607-1 650). The artists of the Kano family were the leading exponents of the old "Chi- nese" style in Japan. For their paintings in ink monochrome they selected subjects from ancient Chinese history, stories of filial piety and of sages. The handling of the ink is done with breadth as well as with a simplification of tones, so that the interest is one of startling contrasts, of heavy blacks against areas of a much lighter tone. The freedom of ex- ecution is in marked contrast to that of another painter of the Kano school, Hanabusa Itcho. The "Celebrations of the Twelve Months" (Fig. 3) by Itcho (1652-1 724), a pupil of Kano Yasunobu (1 61 3-1685) who was the younger brother of Naonobu, is the work of a man who was expelled from the Kano studio. The figure painting by Naonobu is one of baroque severity and dignity. Itch6, on the other hand, revels in movement and gaiety. His firm and quickly curving line creates a feeling of action and excitement. There are dozens of small figures, whose gay activities relate some of the seasonal festivities of the Japanese. The center of interest is contemporary humanity engaged in its everyday pursuits. Such a painting is akin in spirit XXXVI, 25</page><page sequence="5">BULLETIN OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS to the Ukiyoe, though the technique is still that of a Kano artist. Other aspects of the Kano style can be studied in a group of screens of which one is "Hsiian Tsung and the Battle of Flowers." Such a screen as this in the style of Kano Sanraku carries on the tradition that started in the Momoyama period ( 1568-1615) of using strong colors on a gold ground, the kind of decoration that harmonized with the castle building spirit of the age. Exceptional to the general development of Jap- anese art is one anonymous screen of a "European King and his Court," reminding us of the presence of the first foreigners in Japan in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this case the Japanese artist has attempted with oriental pigments to imi- tate the effect of Western oil painting. His model must have been some European work of art brought to Japan by the Jesuits. The present exhibition also includes a singular collection of nine screens by the eighteenth century artist Soga Sh6haku (1 730-1 783). One of the pair of "Landscape" screens adds to our knowledge of his biography, for it bears a seal commonly used by him and the family name of Miura. Hitherto his family name has been unrecorded. The word Soga has always been rightly understood to express Shohaku's voluntary dependence on the style of the fifteenth century artist Soga Jasoku. Sh6haku's style was too coarse to be fully appreci- ated in his own generation. Many of his contem- poraries considered him mad, though at the same time the vigor of his brushwork was admitted. Such a painting as the "Three Laughers" (Fig. 4) ad- mirably reveals the power of line to create an emotion. The laughter of these three men, one of whom has vowed never to cross a certain bridge, bursts forth spontaneously as they realize suddenly that good friendship and conversation have carried the party beyond the bridge. Altogether fifty-five screens will be shown. As in the first exhibition, the particular strength of the collection is again that of the Kano tradition. There are representative works from the time of Koi (died 1636) to Gah6 (1835-1908). ROBERT T. PAINE, JR. Note on Objects Assigned to the Museum by the Egyptian Government D URING the last three years the Harvard- Boston Egyptian Expedition has been occupied with the preparation of The History of the Qiza Necropolis. While working on this publication a small gang of men has been constantly employed in minor clearing operations, sometimes inside the old excavations and sometimes along their edges where it seemed possible to gain further information on the chronological connections of certain tombs. When the complex of mastabas of the Senezem-ib family had been cleared and recorded, it was found that these tombs had been built on debris about a meter deep, and that this debris contained remains of older mastabas. Examination showed that this earlier cemetery, called the Secondary Cemetery of Officials of the Fifth Dynasty, had occupied the space north of the old Cheops Cemetery and eastward to the edge of the enclosure of the Cheops Pyramid. In 1915 a limited area of small ruined mastabas had been left unexcavated north of the Senezem-ib complex and westward for about fifty meters. Work- ing over the history of this family, which con- tained seven men who directed the public works of all the kings from the last two of the Fifth Dynasty to the last of the Sixth, it seemed desirable in 1936 to ascertain the dates of the tombs in this unexcavated area. Our small gang was set to work clearing northward from the edge of the unexcavated area and uncovered a number of small ruined mas- tabas which had been partly broken down by the theft of building stone and thoroughly plundered. The first, numbered G 2420, belonged to a man named Nezemuw who bore the titles "Overseer of Purifying Priests, Gardener of Pharaoh." The mastaba was nearly destroyed but contained a chapel, a statue chamber (serdab), and four burial shafts. The statue chamber had been cleared out and reused for a burial of the Sixth Dynasty, but in the adjoining shaft D were found four statuettes thrown out from the serdab, one of Nezemuw standing (made by his son), two seated statuettes of the same man, and one servant statuette of a man preparing a jar for filling with wine. The three statuettes of Nezemuw (one 1 of which is illustrated in Fig. 1) were given to the Expedition, while the servant statuette was taken by the Cairo Museum. All these figures date from the second half of the Fifth Dynasty. Immediately east of the tomb of Nezemuw another partly destroyed mastaba was uncovered, belonging to an "Overseer of the Gardeners of Pharaoh," Min-nefer. The chapel was almost en- tirely destroyed, but the statue chamber was partly preserved and contained four standing statuettes of Min-nefer, of which one2 was complete (Fig. 2), two headless (Fig. 3, one3), and the fourth with the body missing from the waist up. All of these pieces were assigned to the Expedition. In thieves' debris around these two mastabas were found two statuettes which may have come from either of the two serdabs. One was an or- dinary servant figure, a girl grinding grain, which was taken by the Cairo Museum. The other was an incomplete pair statuette of a man and woman, which was assigned to the Expedition. It lacks the man's head and the feet of both figures. The woman's head4 is shown in Fig. 6. From the adjoining area on the west, in thieves' debris in the shaft G 2407 D, came two statuettes each of a different person. One, a complete stand- ing figure of the "Overseer of Gardeners," Khu- "Reg. No. 37.641; height 54.2 cm. 2Reg. No. 37.637; height 55.3 cm. 3Reg. No. 37.639; height 61.0 cm. 4Reg.
