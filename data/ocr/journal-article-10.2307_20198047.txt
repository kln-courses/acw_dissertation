<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphism in beginning readers Little research has been done on the effects of anthropomorphism on children's reading. The author pre sents questions for future research. Jay S. Blanchard Anthropomorphism, the process of giving human qualities to nonhu mans, can take many forms. We see human faces in the moon, give human attributes to our automobiles, get mad at furniture when we bump into it, and use metaphoric language (the fire ate the dry timber, for example). In today's beginning reading mate rials, anthropomorphism as a literary technique is apparent in the portrayal of animals, monsters, and machines as characters possessing various de grees of humanity. Some of these anthropomorphic characters come from traditional children's literature 586 The Reading Teacher February 1982 (folktales, fables, myths). Many other forms of anthropomorphism, how ever, are from newer sources, either updated versions of older classics or anthropomorphic versions of the formerly typical family story. Both versions have become popular and, when combined with the classics, represent much of the content for beginning readers. This article is neither pro nor con on the use of anthropomorphism in beginning read ing materials, but hopes to provide an agenda for discussion and ques tions. History Unquestionably, anthropomorphism has a long history. The Greeks (500 B.C.) are credited with the first recorded academic discussion on the topic in the Western world. Both these early Greek discussions on anthropomorphism and those of a</page><page sequence="2">more contemporary nature are based on the notion that the unknown must be similar to the known if thoughts or actions are to be understood, ex pressed or made bearable. Further more, for actions or thoughts to be understood, the unknown must be related to life as humans know it. Thus anthropomorphism as an at tempt to deal with the unknown is a psychological process. In children it represents an effort to deal with a largely unknown world (i.e., a child gives human qualities to a favorite toy). In adults it is less common and generally reserved for that which is truly unknown to society (i.e., aliens characterized in movies as resembling humans). Anthropomorphism as a literary technique is a writer's attempt to con vey a message appropriate to humans, through a nonhuman format. As a literary device, it has a rich and colorful past. Arbuthnot (1972) has chronicled many aspects of anthro pomorphism in children's literature and most teachers have favorite anthropomorphic stories to read and reread to students. As a psychological process, anthro pomorphism's history is more clouded. Although it has often been discussed, there has been little empirical research (Looft and Bartz, 1969). In fact it was not until the late 1920s and early 1930s that interest in the phenomenon reached the point of scientific inquiry. Consequently, by the 1940s two schools of thought regarding anthro pomorphism as a psychological proc ess emerged. One position claimed that anthropomorphism is universally present in children; the other, only accidentally present. Piaget (1929, 1933) and his con temporaries Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) felt their Socratic questioning research pointed toward anthropo morphism as a common response in all children. Indeed, the emergence of the phenomenon also followed devel opmental and chronological stages. In stage one, 4-6 years, children give the qualities of life to objects that demonstrate usefulness and general activity. Before this stage, children assign life or human attributes to everything and anything. In stage two, 6-7 years, children give life qualities to those objects that have movement. According to Piaget, stage three, 8-10 years, is a refinement of stage two, in that children only ascribe life qualities to those objects that move spontaneously. Finally, in stage four, 11 year olds reserve life qualities for plants and animals. Huang (1943) and his supporters, while generally in the minority, believe that anthropomorphic re sponses are occasional and unpre dictable in nature. These responses are due mostly to errors made by children as they try to interpret and decipher the world around them. Each school of thought unasham edly supports its views with research which requires more intuitive than empirical ability. In fact, progress toward answering questions surround ing anthropomorphism has been slow, particularly slow for questions that relate to either reading theory or reading instruction theory. Only one possibly supportable fact is known about the effect of literary anthropo morphism on readers: familiarity with the "real world" functions of anthropomorphized characters seems to reduce the impact of anthropo morphism (Nass, 1956; Looft and Charles, 1969; Berzonsky, 1971; Ber zonsky, Ondrako and Williams, 1977). Anthropomorphism in beginning reading materials Within the last decade, publishers of basal readers have introduced more anthropomorphic stories and char acters in their readiness books, pre primers, primers, and first readers. Informally, at least, it has been suggested that this trend is conscious Anthropomorphism in beginning readers 587</page><page sequence="3">Anthropomorphism in beginning readers Houghton and Miff lin Reading Program, 1981 RR Getting Ready to Read In the pictures PP Bears 67% PP Balloons 60% PP Boats 57% Primer Sunshine 38% 1 Moonbeams 42% Allyn and Bacon Reading Program (Pathfinder), 1978 RR Moving Days In the pictures RR Summer Fun In the pictures PP Rides and Races 100% Primer High Wires and Wigs 87% Primer Surprises and Prizes 0% 1 Upside and Down 38% Ginn 720 Rainbow Edition, 1979 RR Ready for Rainbows In the pictures PP A Pocket of Sunshine 0% PP A Duck is a Duck 33% Primer Helicopters and Gingerbread 33% 1 May I Come In? 20% Harper and Row Reading Basics Plus, 1980 RR Get Ready, Get Set, Go Read In the pictures PP Places and Puzzles 15% PP Fish and Fables 20% PP Rain and Riddles 25% Primer Webs and Wheels 20% 1 Socks and Secrets 26% Rand McNally Reading Program (Young America), 1978 RR ABC and Me In the pictures PP Little Pig 100% PP C.A.

These pressure groups either want publishers to exclude or include certain portrayals of humans in their stories. By way of response, publishers seem to have switched to animal or nonhuman characters as a replacement. In cur rent reading materials, the "human family story" seems to have atrophied. This is not to imply there has been a predictable effect on reading behav ior. Quite the opposite?at the mo ment no one knows exactly what the effects of anthropomorphism are on any reading behaviors. 588 The Reading Teacher February 1982 Text review A review of the reading readiness materials and beginning readers (PP l2) describing percentages of stories which contain anthropomorphism represented by pictures and prose is presented in the Table. Poems, rid dles, information features (expository prose) and other activities were not counted as stories, regardless of whether they contained anthropo morphic characters. (For the readi ness materials if anthropomorphic characters were presented in the pictures of the activities, it was noted only that it appeared).

Looking at the Table, four levels of usage emerge: (1) high (above 50%), (2) moderate (25-50%), (3) low (below 25%), and (4) undeterminable (varying levels). These levels, although arbitrary, raise some interesting questions for read ing research and curriculum develop ment. For instance, does level of usage affect reading behaviors? If so, how? If not, why not? The Figure presents us with another series of questions concerning an thropomorphism in beginning read ing materials. There are four types of anthropomorphized characters cur rently fashionable in readiness and reading materials: mammals, other living creatures, machines, monsters. More than occasionally, several of these characters appear in one story and display varying degrees of anthro pomorphism, changing "chameleon like" from page to page. These changes appear to fit some broad patterns. Pattern 1?Characters in a human setting with few human attri butes and no speech Pattern 2?Characters in a natural setting with few human attri Anthropomorphism in beginning readers 589</page><page sequence="5">Types of anthropomorphic characters Mammal Nonmammal Nonliving (monsters, machines) Human setting Natural or nonhuman setting Human setting Natural or nonhuman setting Human setting Natural or nonhuman setting Human attributes Talking Walking Wearing clothes Other human paraphernalia Affective behaviors butes except for speech Pattern 3?Characters in a human setting with few human attri butes except for speech Pattern 4?Characters in a natural setting with many human attri butes such as clothing and with speech Pattern 5?Characters in a human setting with many human attri butes such as clothing and with speech Preparing the reader? Most publishers, either through teach er-directed discussions or workbook selections, prepare young readers to cope with anthropomorphism in the stories they read (or have read to them). Are these preparation or read iness activities really necessary for comprehension? By way of an answer, little research evidence supports the inclusion of this readiness stage in reading. On the other hand, do the activities adequately prepare the reader to deal with anthropomorphism as a literary device or a psychological process? Again, there seems to be little research evidence they do! As a matter of fact, only one activity in all the activities reviewed follows what is known 590 The Reading Teacher February 1982 about preparing children to deal with anthropomorphism. In this readiness activity for anthropomorphism, "real life" photographs are introduced alongside the anthropomorphized cartoon characterizations. The read ers thus gain a chance to familiarize themselves with the real-life attributes of the characters before they encoun ter their fantasy counterparts. The remaining readiness activities, with various formats and names, share some interesting traits. First, many activities give the impression they wish to widen a reader's thoughts on anthropomorphism. These activi ties feature creative and imaginative uses of inanimate or nonhuman characters. ("If frogs could talk, what would they say?") Just as many activities, nonetheless, appear to reduce anthropomorphism. ("Help the children realize the Three Bears is make-believe!") Second, in most cases the children do the activities after the story has been read. Third, little attention seems to be paid to the psychological reasons why a reader responds or does not respond with anthropomorphism. ("Is the tooth fairy a real person?" "No." "Is the Easter Bunny a real person?" "No." "Is Santa Claus a real person?"</page><page sequence="6">"Yes.") Not too bad a score?two right and one wrong?but the reasons why each are considered human or nonhuman by the reader are not known. Is the response more or less important than its development? In conclusion The truth, simply put, is that the effects of either text-oriented or psychologically-oriented anthropo morphism on young readers are not known. Recently, Schwartz (1980) found that at least two important linguistic judgments, semantic and syntactic "sentence well formedness," develop in relationship to a child's belief about life concepts. Schwartz's research points toward the need to gather as much information about anthropomorphism and the novice reader as possible. Unfortunately, until such information crystalizes, many questions remain unanswered, indeed, unasked! Is psychological anthropomorphism prevalent among children? If so, under what circumstances? If psychological anthropomorphism exists to a great degree, what are its effects on young readers? What are the relationships between psychological anthropomorphism and literary anthropomorphism? If publishers are going to continue a trend toward more literary anthropomorphism, what are the effects on young readers? Are there psychological and literary anthropomorphic sch?mas? How do they develop? What is the ancillary of corollary sch?mas? Are there common attributes? What is the relationship between both aspects of anthropomor phism and "reverse" anthropo morphism?giving humans the qualities reserved for nonhu mans?

Advice on planning visits from authors An article in the quarterly Children's Literature in Education contains not only eight children's authors' comments on what it means to them to go into schools and speak to children but advice from author Betty Miles on how to plan a visit to make it meaningful and pleasant. One clear suggestion: Make sure the children are acquainted with at least some of the author's works!
