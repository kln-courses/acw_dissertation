Thiynmiaterion with Lid Greek (South Italy or Sicily), fourth century B.C. Marble with polychromy, H (thymia- terion): 22.9 cm (9 in.); H (lid): 6.4 cm (2/2 in.) 95.AA.59 Sculpted and lathe-turned, the thymiate- rion, or incense burner, is composed of a stemmed foot; a deep receptacle, which may have been made separately; and a close-fitting perforated lid. The stem of the vessel rises from a disc-shaped foot formed of two ridges that are separated by a concave profile, and meets a flaring tray. The deep bowl of the thymiaterion that held the burning incense is centered on the tray, on which fresh incense may have been set. Both the lip of this receptacle and the lower edge of the lid are slightly flared and scored along the edges to sug- gest an organic plant pattern. The dome- shaped lid is formed in a series of three ascending horizontal bands that are per- forated at regular intervals to allow the scented smoke to escape. The top of the lid is flat and undecorated, and originally there may have been a finial that was sepa- rately made. The thymiaterion and its lid are in excellent condition, and in many areas the polished original marble surface has been preserved. There are some traces of red pigment on the foot and lid, and there is a yellow-brown resinous residue on the underside of the lid indicative of prior use. PROVENANCE: New York art market. 2. Three Fish Plates Greek (South Italy or Sicily), fourth century B.C. Marble with polychromy, Diam (.i): 25.4 cm (io in.); Diam (.2 and .3): 2I cm (8/4 in.) 95.AA-58.I-.3 Turned from a fine-grained white marble, the three plates bear traces of their origi- nal polychromy. Only on the large plate (.i), however, can the design scheme be readily discemed. In its central depression is an eight petal rosette with alternating purple and red petals. On the plate's flat surface are four palmettes, two painted with a violet pigment, two with a red pigment. Closely spaced short strokes of a purple pigment surrounded by a red pig- ment decorate the outer circumference of the plate. The bottom of the plate bears traces of an overall layer of an orange-red pigment. One of the smaller plates (.2) has a large splotch of red pigment on its upper surface, while the other (.0) shows traces of a blue-green pigment in the central depression and on the flat surface. The fragile nature of the painted decoration makes it most unlikely that these marble plates actually functioned as dishes for serving fish, and it seems more probable that they were meant for cere- monial purposes. The three plates range from good to excellent condition. The large plate is almost complete with some restored areas. One of the smaller ones (.2) has suffered breakage, which has been repaired with minor losses restored; the other (.3) is intact and unbroken.

Sarcophagus with Lid Roman, late second century-early third century A.D. Made in an Attic workshop Pentelic marble, H (sarcophagus): 134 cm (53 in.); H (lid): ioo cm (39/2 in.); L (sarcophagus): 249 cm (98 in.); L (lid): 2I8 cm (86 in.); W (sarcophagus): I47 cm (58 in.); W (lid): 95 cm (37/2 in.) 95.AA.80 Carved in high relief on three sides of the box are scenes from the legend of Achilles, the Greek hero of the Trojan War and central figure in the Iliad by Ho- mer. On the right end of the sarcophagus, Achilles is discovered by Odysseus while hiding among the daughters of King Ly- comedes on the island of Skyros to avoid joining the Greeks at Troy. On the left end, Achilles arms for battle with Odys- seus and a doryphoros looking on. The armor he dons is new, having been re- cently received from his mother, Thetis. The climax of his confrontation with the great Trojan hero Hector is shown on the front, as Achilles mounts his chariot to drag Hector's body around the walls of the city. On the back of the sarcophagus, the shallower relief scene of Lapiths fighting centaurs may also be understood as a ref- erence to Achilles, who was educated by the centaur Cheiron. On the lid, two fig- ures recline on an elaborate couch; their heads were left in an unfinished state so that the portraits of the deceased could be carved in after the piece was purchased. The sarcophagus and lid are in an excellent state of preservation with only some chipping and two small losses of sculptural components, the sword held by the figure positioned at the right edge of the front and the lower end of the spear held by the doryphoros on the left end. The back and left end of the box are less finished than the front and right end, probably indicating that it was originally placed in the comer of a room where those sides would not have been easily seen.

Offering Box (Arca) with Key Gallo-Roman, second century A.D., perhaps I30-I80 Bronze, H (arca): 5I CM (20/16 in.); H (key): I.82 cm (Y4 in.); Diam (ring of key): 2.62 cm (I in.) 95.AC.29 This offering box is a hexagonal roofed structure that rests on three supports in the shape of feline paws. The body is as- sembled on a cast base from six flat panels outlined by a half-round molding with an incised cable pattern. At the bottom of one side is a low door with a keyhole. The roof is composed of six concave sides and is decorated with a pattem of incised imbrication; spheres ornament the comers. On the top, there is an elabo- rately profiled platform with a Kymation molding, and spheres embellish its upper- most comers. The top surface of the plat- form bears footmarks of a now-missing statuette, which stood at right angles to the side with the door. Between the foot- marks is a coin slot.</page><page sequence="5">Antiquities 89 * U The offering box is said to have been found with a pair of bronze busts in the Museum's collection (89.AB.67) and a statue of Cobannus, a Gaulish god iden- tified with Mars, in the collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman. Most likely all of these pieces were displayed in a local shrine of the luventus, a youth or- ganization of the Roman state that pre- pared aristocratic young men of Rome and its provinces for military service and a career in government. The offering box may have held the monthly dues paid by members of this organization. The box is complete except for the missing figure on the top and some sections of the cable molding that borders the panels. There is a large loss or casting defect in the upper edge of the back panel. A small round hole pierces the middle of the roof section above the side with the door. The metal has a golden-brown to black to grayish green patina with extremely fine pitting over broad areas. PROVENANCE: Donated by Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman. BIBLIOGRAPHY: J.

TERRA-COTTA Neolithic 5. Eleven Figurines Greek, early to middle Neolithic, 6000-4000 B.C. Terra-cotta, various dimensions, H: from 3.4 cm (iYm in.) to 7.4 cm (27X in.) 95.AD.4.1I-. I I The eleven figurines are of standard Neolithic anthropomorphic types of both genders. The majority are of female forms in the steatopygous (Mother Goddess) type, shown in seated and standing posi- tions (. I, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8,. -0, . I I). The two male figures (.2, .9), which are com- paratively rare, are seated with one (.2) enthroned. Although varying in their de- gree of anthropomorphism, the figures are schematic with the component parts of the body formed by hand or rendered by incision. One figure (.3) iS possibly zoomorphic. Its cylindrical, almost phal- lic, form, which spreads at the base, and the beaklike nose and slit eyes are similar to the so-called Bird Goddess type. The function of Neolithic figurines is still unknown and has led to controversy and debate. In addition to the standard interpretation for the figures serving as representatives of deities, or idols, alterna- tive suggested functions include amulets (both decorative and apotropaic), votive offerings, representations of humans (whether cultic or secular), or dolls for children. The overall condition of the figurines is good with only small chips and minor scratches on their surfaces. Some figurines are missing body parts.

I): 7.6 cm (3 in.); Greatest Extent (.2): 4.5 cm (I/4 in.); Greatest Extent (.0) 4.6 cm (1516 in.) 95.AE.5.I-.3 All three fragments are of reddish clay and are covered on the exterior with white slip. The largest fragment (.I) is also cov- ered with white slip on the interior, and its exterior surface is decorated with a blackish brown paint/glaze in a pattem of eleven parallel zigzags, a vertical line, and two triangular areas. The second frag- ment (.2) is sharply curved, and perhaps comes from the area of the junction of shoulder to body on the vessel. Its exte- rior is decorated with a linear pattern of crossing straight lines and chevrons painted or glazed with a red pigment. The surface of the third fragment (.3) is incised with parallel lines that expose the brownish red clay beneath the white slip. The condition of the fragments is good with just scat- tered nicks and abrasions. PROVENANCE: Donated jointly by Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman and Herbert L. Lucas. Attic Red-Figure 7.

Glass, H: 6.9 cm (2'Yu6 in.); Diam (body): 8.7 cm (3/8 in.); Diam (rim): 7.2 cm (2'Y16 in.) 95.AF.60 The decoration of this small mold-blown cup of transparent blue to greenish blue glass consists of a Greek inscription encir- cling the body at its widest point with horizontal ribs providing an upper and lower frame. The inscription reads: EMPAINOY ENl HAPEI (Be glad that you have come). Closely spaced tongues decorate the lower part of the body of the cup. The base has a flat resting surface, which is decorated with concentric circles and is kicked in at the center to form a raised boss on the interior of the cup. The rim is uneven, having been cracked off from the blowpipe after inflation was completed, and is only slightly finished, because it was ground down after the ves- sel was annealed. The mold was made in three pieces, and the seams are evident on the cup where the segments of the mold were joined. The cup is in excellent con- dition. With the exception of one small chip along the rim, it is intact, a condition rarely seen in ancient glass; its surface is free of iridescence. Given its pristine condition, it is possible that the cup was deposited in a grave as a gift for the deceased. PROVENANCE: European art market.

Such vases would have been a prominent part of any nobleman's collection of agates, crystals, porcelains, bronzes, and other curiosities that were often displayed in specially designed Cabinets des curiosite or des raretes. The only place in France where hard-stone objects such as these were made at the end of the seventeenth century was at the Manufacture royale des nieubles de la Couronne (also known as the Gobelins), established in Paris in I663.

All the backs are constructed a chassis and have cane seats. The maker, Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, was a frequent supplier to the crown and was appointed menuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi (joiner to the royal household). He worked for prestigious clients such as the king's daughter Louise-Elizabeth, duchesse de Parme, and probably the duc d'Orleans. For many commissions Foliot worked under the orders of the architect and designer Pierre Contant d'Ivry (French, I 698-I 777).

I825-29 Oil on paper, 35 x 6i cm (3/2 x 24 in.) 95*GG.3 This is one of a small group of oil sketches on paper by the artist that have recently come to light. Closson was bom in Liege, which is now a part of modem Belgium, but was at the time under French suzer- ainty. From I 8 I 7 tO I 824 he trained in Paris under Antoine-jean Gros (French, 177I-I835) and later traveled to Italy, where he discovered a passion for land- scape painting in the open air. This oil sketch could have been made during his Italian stay or shortly after his return to Liege in I 829. The juxtaposition of the green and brown leaves, with the leaf at the center changing color, suggests the cycle of life, a theme reminiscent of Dutch vanitas painting.

This fully worked-up watercolor of Conway Castle on the northem coast is based on his studies of the subject in the Hereford Court sketchbook (London, Tate Gal- lery); a finished oil painting of a variant composition is in the collection of the duke of Westminster. In this watercolor Tumer has broken away from the topo- graphical tradition of landscape in which he had been trained, and has moved to- ward a far more dramatic approach to the '4</page><page sequence="10">94 Acquisitions/1995 representation of the motif. The bad weather, rough sea, and patches of bril- liant sunlight are as much the focus of the artist's attention as the castle seen in the middle distance from a low vantage point.

Tipu Sahib, sultan of Mysore, was the last of the independent rulers to resist the British unification of India. His defeat and death following an assault led by Baird was therefore an im- portant event in the consolidation of British power.

She frequently sat for dif- ferent members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of artists who shared a number of common aims, includ- ing that of retuming to the simplicity of early Italian Renaissance painting. From i852 on, she sat exclusively for Rossetti, who became obsessed by her wistful beauty; in I 86o they married. This is one of a large number of likenesses of her by the artist, in which she is often portrayed resting. An insomniac, she took laudanum to help her sleep, and her death in I862 iS said to have been caused by an overdose of the drug. PROVENANCE: Herbert Pearson; R. M.

I 7 Swanevelt was a landscape painter whose career was spent largely in Rome. Like many Northern painters active there at the time, such as Claude Lorrain (French, i6oo- I682) and Nicolas Poussin (French, I594-I665), his work was inspired by the nearby countryside of the Roman cam- pagna. The artist's drawing style owes much to Claude's special use of brush and wash to evoke bright sunlight in land- scape, although certain effects of texture in the foreground are his own. This study may have been made in the studio rather than in the open, since the terrain is per- haps too contrived. PROVENANCE: J. F. Gigoux, Paris; E.

Marked and inscribed: collection mark R(?) in the lower right corner. 95.GA.I8 The story ofJoseph interpreting the dreams of Pharoah's butler and baker in prison is told in Genesis (40: I-20): according to Joseph's prediction, one of them would be reinstated in the ruler's service but the other one would be hang- ed. Not surprisingly, the response of the butler to the foretelling is in marked con- trast to that of the baker, who recoils in dismay. The figure ofJoseph is drawn on a piece of paper that has been glued over the sheet containing the butler and baker, an alteration probably made by Rem- brandt himself. This recently discovered drawing is related to a study of the same subject on the verso of a drawing of circa I639 in the British Museum, London.

This example has been dated around I675, toward the end of his career. In it a vast panorama opens up within the tiny confines of this piece of paper. The eye is easily led along a roadway in the fore- ground into a landscape extending un- broken to a mountainous horizon. The texture and colors of the bodycolor sug- gest the different features of the terrain as well as a luminous mist that covers some of the space.

This is a finished study for an engraving by Etienne Picart (French, I632-I72I), one of a series of illustrations for the Missal of Pope Alexan- der VII, published in 1662. Other artists who supplied designs for the plates in- clude Pietro da Cortona (Italian, 1596- I669; the teacher of Cortese), Ciro Ferri (Italian, I634-I689), and Carlo Maratti (Italian, I625-I7I3). The delicate use of the chalk is also reminiscent of the work of Andrea Sacchi (Italian, 1599- I 66 I; see below, number 34).

Signed and inscribed: lf. Cassasf en Roma 1780 by the artist in the lower right corner in brown ink. 95.GA. I I The formative event in Cassas's artistic ca- reer was his period of travel in Italy from I779 to I783. He made this drawing in 1780, the year in which he became a stu- dent at the French Academy in Rome and probably the time when he worked with the Neoclassical landscape painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (French, I750-I8I9). The Italian campagna's pro- found impact on the young Cassas is clearly evident in this large, impressive scene. It shows the waterfalls at Terni, an ancient Roman aqueduct built in 27I B.C., located about forty miles north of Rome. The small figures, especially those on the eminence to the left, appear to be dressed all'antica, which could be a reference to the classical origin of the falls. The diminutive size of the figures, coupled with the com- position's low viewpoint, emphasize the sublimity of the spectacle. A somewhat unusual feature is the elaborate border en- framing the scene, which is on the same piece of paper as the drawing itself.

Charged with signing arrest warrants during the Reign of Terror, David was sent to prison in I795. Arrested in the same year was Bemard des Jeuzines, called Bemard des Saintes (French, 175 I - I 8 I 9), for having been the president of the tribunal of his native city, Saintes, as well as for having been a member of the Assemblee Legisla- tive. David's portrait of his fellow prisoner was drawn onJuly 24, I795, when the two were imprisoned together in the Quatre Nations jail. David portrays Bernard des Saintes with extraordinary immediacy. The sitter, who would have been forty-four years old, sits with arms folded across his chest, gazing impassively forward. The round format, inspired by antique coins and medals, hints at the comparison between this patriotic citizen of the French Re- public and the citizens of the Republic of ancient Rome. There are several other portrait drawings in David's so-called se- ries of Prison Portraits done in this same format and scale (The Art Institute of Chicago; Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art; Ottawa, National Gallery of Canada).

Alvarez was hon- ored for reestablishing Spanish/Catholic authority in the Netherlands during his tyrannical rule as governor general there (r. i567-73). To this end, he formed the Council of Troubles (called by the epithet the Council of Blood), which overrode local laws and condemned some twelve thousand rebels to death. The drawing is a finished preparatory study, with considerable differences, for the painting of the same subject, which was commissioned in i 8 i 5 by the four- teenth duke of Alba (Montaubon, Musee Ingres). Ingres expended elaborate effort on the drawing, with its resplendent, de- tailed vestments and ritual objects, and carefully worked out the architectural set- ting. In the painting Ingres abandoned this monumental frieze of figures and ar- chitecture; instead, the duke is shown as a diminutive figure on a vast, blood-red dais at the end of a long vista.

The subjects encompass many that inter- ested him during his career.

Marked: estate stamp Nepveu IDegas in the lower right corner; (verso) estate stamp Nepveui/Degas. 95 .GG.43 Degas made this self-portrait around I857-58, during his youthful sojourn in Italy, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four. In it he wears a wide- brimmed hat that casts a shadow over part of his face, and he portrays himself with an air of detachment. This coolness and lack of pretention hint at a passage in one of his early notebooks: "I must realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead." This is one of a group of early self-portraits, and is similar to an example in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts.

Some of the folios contain portraits of the literati and artists who were regularly invited to the Thurs- day evening soirees there. Degas also made the sketches as an aide-m6moire, a reservoir of ideas and motifs gleaned from comtemporary life.

There are many studies of cafe- concert singers, including some that relate to pastels and monotypes, such as Theresa singing La Chanson du chien (folio i i) and Mademoiselle Dumay, shown with a clus- ter of gas lamps behind her (folio I 3). An- other major category of subject matter is the ballet, including dancers (folio 25), and the ballet masterJules Perrot (folio 41), who appears in various other works by Degas. There are also brothel scenes il- lustrating Edmond de Goncourt's novel La Fille Elisa (Paris, I877). As a whole, the sketchbook forms a vivid record of the artist's forays into the broad spectrum of Parisian life, from the rarified gatherings of the elite to the seedy entertainments of the demimonde. The caricatural style of many of the sketches shows I)egas to be a sardonic observer of daily life, somewhat in the tradition of the caricaturist Honor6 Daumier (French, i808- i879).

Suppl. 178c) and an unknown collector MM. 95.GA.36 Ludger Tom Ring was active in the city of Munster in northern Germany near Hol- land, and was one of the earliest practi- tioners of the genre of still-life painting. His meticulous rendering of the costumes and furnishings of the room, as seen in this drawing, would seem to bear witness to his specialization. The two sitters are identified by the inscriptions on the wall behind them, al- though nothing further is known about either person. Hans Furraht, who mea- sures a skull with a compass, may have been an anatomist, while Jacob von der Burch, who studies a stereometric body, may have been a mathematician. There seem to be several levels of meaning in- volved in this drawing; on one level, it is an example of a "friendship portrait," a common type of portrait in sixteenth- century Northern European art, particu- larly among circles of humanists. The skull and the hourglass on the windowsill may also allude to the vanity of earthly life. On yet another level of meaning, the contrast between the man on the left, who engages the viewer, and the one on the right, lost in the study of the object he holds, could refer to both the active and contemplative sides of life.

Napoli 1798 by the artist in the lower left corner in black ink. 95.GD.46 The Neoclassical landscape painter and draftsman Christoph Heinrich Kniep spent almost his entire career in Naples. He was employed by the German writer and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as his personal draftsman during his trip to Naples and Sicily in I787-88. Kniep's reputation as a draftsman rests on his finished drawings of idealized Italian landscapes, such as this example, with his work being in strong demand from wealthy visitors on the Grand Tour. The composition is of an imaginary pastoral vista set in ancient times. The grandeur of the scene is typical of the eighteenth-century notion of the sub- lime-the superhuman power of nature- and is conveyed by the huge cataract, the impact of which is further enhanced by the drawing's large scale and upright for- mat. Kniep's precise rendering of a wide variety of vegetation suggests the scientific interest of eighteenth-century German philosophers, spearheaded by Goethe.

Active as a land- scape painter and designer of large-scale decorative programs for architectural in- teriors, Gartner studied in Dresden with Ludwig Richter (German, I 803 - I 8 84), and spent his career in Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin. This finely executed drawing shows a chapel engulfed by trees and vegetation. Within this world of nature, a solitary, contemplative human presence occurs in the foreground, in the form of a shepherd tending his flock. The forest chapel with a graveyard appears in the background, with a funeral procession moving toward it in the middle distance. These elements allude to the subordina- tion of human existence to the larger forces of nature and God.

This drawing is an early compositional study for a painting of the subject already in the Getty Museum. Although the picture is different in format-it is vertical rather than a horizontal rectangle-the connec- tion between the two works seems indis- putable. The painting is one of a series of twelve that represent stories of the gods, formerly in the Palazzo Ducale at Mantua, which were carried out by Giulio and his assistants. At an early stage in the design of the paintings, Giulio evidently considered having at least one of his compositions as a horizontal rectangle, an idea he clearly abandoned.

I628 Red chalk and red wash, 25.3 x 17.8 cm (I0 x 7/16 in.). Marked: collection marks of Earl Spencer (L. I532) in the lower left corner and J. Fitchett Marsh (L. I455) on the mount, below the lower right corner of the drawing. 95.GB.42 By directing Saint Peter to feed his sheep, Christ gave him charge of his church on earth. The drawing is one of a number of studies made circa I628, probably for a fresco overdoor in Saint Peter's, Rome, although the work seems never to have been carried out. The style and medium are characteristic of Sacchi's delicate draftsmanship, as is the classical restraint of the composition, which is in marked contrast to the more exuberantly Baroque inventions of his rival Pietro da Cortona (Italian, I596-I669). PROVENANCE: Lord John Spencer, Althorp; J. Fitchett Marsh, Warrington; private collec- tion, Copenhagen; Marcello Aldega, New York. 35. MARCO RICCI Italian, I676-I729 Landscape with Travelers, ca.

The weather is fine and the travelers, who converse with each other, speed along in comparative comfort and pass villages on their way. They also overtake less prosperous persons who had to make their way on foot. The fine pen work and extensive use of hatching are hallmarks of Ricci's drawing style. A painted version of this composition is in an Italian private collection.

Signed, marked, and inscribed: Aeques Marcus Benefial Romanus Ano- rum Quadraginta Septem Mensisque Unius by the artist in the cartouche below in red chalk; collection marks of Charles Rogers (L. 624) in the center of the cartouche and William Esdaile (L. 2617) in the lower right corner. 95.GB.34 Benefial, who was active in Rome, was one of the leading painters of his day. His work occupies a place between the late Baroque classicism of Carlo Maratti (I625 - 1713) and the early Neoclassicism of his two successful pupils, Anton Ra- phael Mengs (German, I 728- I 779) and Pompeo Batoni (Italian, 1708-1787). This self-portrait, which shows the artist at the height of his success, was almost certainly drawn at the request of the Florentine collector and art historian, Francesco Maria Niccol6 Gabburri (I676- I 742), who for much of his life had assembled a collection of drawn self-portraits and por- traits of artists, probably with the inten- tion of using them as the basis for engravings to illustrate his monumental and still unpublished series of artists' lives, the Vite di pittori [sic] (Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale).

GIUSEPPE CADES Italian, I750-I799 Tullia About to Ride Over the Body of Her Father in Her Chariot, ca. I770-75 Pen and brown ink, white and gray bodycolor over black chalk, on gray prepared paper, 49.5 x 66.4 cm (I9/2 X 26/16 in.) 95.GA.25 Cades was one of the greatest practition- ers of the Neoclassical style in Rome, and a gifted and original draftsman. The hor- rific story of Tullia's ambitiousness is told by Livy (Comm. I-5: I85ff.). The daugh- ter of Servius Tullius, Tullia was married to Tarquinius Superbus and had her father murdered so that her husband would be- come king and she queen. She defied the warnings of her advisers to keep away from the crowds that had gathered in Rome at the news of her father's death. Instead, she went out in her chariot and coming upon her father's corpse in the street, rode over it, cursing his name as she did so. In his drawing Cades has amusingly juxtaposed the ferocity of her determination with the shocked and pity- ing expression of one of the horses.

GIULIO ROMANO (Giulio Pippi) Italian, ca. I499-I546 The Holy Family, 1520-23 Oil (possibly mixed with tempera) on panel, 77.8 x 6I.9 cm (30% x 24%8 in.) 95.PB.64 The composition and figure types seen in this painting are foreshadowed in Giulio's works such as 7he Madonna della Gatta (Naples, Museo di Capodimonte). The Getty painting, however, bears the strongest stylistic similarity to the artist's Martyrdom of Saint Stephen (Genoa, Santo Stefano), a commission com- pleted by 1523. The woman in the background of The Holy Family is clearly related to the figure of the Virgin in The Visitation (Madrid, Museo del Prado), installed in San Silvestro in Aquila in 1520 as by Raphael during his lifetime, although generally held to be by his shop today. A drawing of or for the figure in the Getty painting has been convincingly attributed to Giovanni Francesco Penni (Italian, ca. I488-ca. I582; Windsor, Royal Li- brary; see A. E. Popham andJ. Wilde, The Italian Drawings of the XV and XVI Centutries in the Collection of His Majesty the King at Windsor Castle [London, I9491, no. 8 I Iv), demonstrating the broad use of such figures by Raphael's shop. Infrared reflectography has revealed that the semicircular pentiment in the landscape is the opening of a coffered barrel vault originally planned by Giulio. Numerous smaller changes as well as under- drawing can also be detected. At least three copies of The Holy Family survive: (i) a crude picture, de- scribed on a Witt Library photo mount as being with the "Municipal Art Gallery, Chicago," but untraceable at the Art Institute; (2) a drawing at Gijon (see A. E. Perez Sinchez, Catalogo de la collec- cion de dibujos del Institutojovellanos de Gi- jon [Madrid, I969], no.

REMBRANDT HARMENSZ. VAN RIJN Dutch, I606-I669 The Abduction of Europa, I632 Oil on a single oak panel, 62.2 x 77 cm (24/2 x 30Y16 in.). Inscribed: on brown stone lower right RHL (in monogram) van /Ryn. 1632. 95.PB.7 This dramatic scene depicts the well- known episode from Ovid's Metamorphoses (2.844-75) in which Jupiter, disguised as a magnificent white bull, abducts Europa, Princess of Tyre, and takes her across the sea to the continent that would bear her name. Completed the year of Rembrandt's move from Leiden to Amsterdam, this daring treatment of the animated ex- change between Europa and her stricken companions in a lush landscape setting served both as a demonstration of his painterly skill and as a Northern chal- lenge to the Italian tradition of mytho- logical istoria. On the basis of a seventeenth-century inventory, The Abduction of Europa may have been owned by Jacque Specx (Dutch, I588/89-I652), the Amsterdam trader and Governor-General of the East Indies (I629-32). The panel is one of several mythological scenes Rembrandt painted between I629 and I634, in an attempt to establish himself among the cosmopolitan Amsterdam clientele. The integration of the landscape into the dra- matic narrative makes The Abduction of Europa unique among these scenes. The meticulous attention to detail, smooth handling, and sumptuous costumes, which characterize Rembrandt's early illusionis- tic mastery, are clearly evident in this beautifully preserved work.

Signed and dated: on the ledge of the dais at lower right Rembrantf 1633. 95.PB. 1 5 This obscure subject comes from the apoc- ryphal Book of Daniel (chapter I4) and tells of the prophet's unmasking of idolatry at the court of Babylon. Rembrandt was perhaps inspired by a series of engravings after Martin van Heemskerck (Dutch, 1498-1574) depicting the story of Daniel and Bel (see Hollstein, vol. 8, nos. 534- 43). Van Heemskerck's second print shows essentially the same subject and may have provided a model, although Rembrandt completely transformed it into a coherent, focused dramatic composition. The re- presentation of the idol as a seated statue perhaps derives from this source, but Rembrandt created an air of mystery by shrouding most of the graven image be- hind drapery swags. He also reduced the architecture and number of figures to focus on the dramatic interaction between the mighty king and the boy sent by God. An untraced copy of the painting was lent by Jac. Hageraats and Son of The Hague to the Burlington Fine Arts Club exhibition, Counterfeits, Imitations and Copies of Works of Art (London, I924), p. 42, no. 30.

THEODORE GERICAULT French, 1791-1824 Three Lovers, ca. I8 I7-20 Oil on canvas, 22.5 X 29.8 cm (8x x i i/ in) 95.PA.72 G6ricault made this oil sketch during the height of his career, around the time when he was working on the Raft of the Meduisa (I8I9). The nonnarrative subject illustrates a couple, clothed in contempo- rary dress, whose embrace is observed by a nude female onlooker. The nude's torso artfully complements the statue of Venus at the left. Drawn curtains, dramatic light- ing, and classicizing furnishings evoke a theatrical space. Gericault's erotic subject is fore- shadowed by small-scale paintings by late eighteenth-century artists such as Jean Honore Fragonard (French, I732- I8o6). Gericault's unprecedented, direct treatment of the theme most closely relates to popular contemporary erotic prints. In the Three Lovers he retains the actuality of these prints, but his translation of a contemporary event into a timeless setting also historicizes the present and makes modem life a subject appropriate for high art. This sketch was intended as a finished, independent work. Until its dis- covery by Philippe Grunchec in I992, it was known only through a reference by Charles Clement, the artist's earliest biog- rapher. The Getty sketch is Gericault's single known surviving oil in a genre that the artist frequently explored in drawing. This unlined canvas, still on its original stretcher, illustrates Gericault's synthesis of graphic mastery with vigorous painterly control. Its acquisition complements the Museum's preparatory oil sketches by Gericault, Riderless Horses (i8I7) and Por- trait Study of a Man (I 8 I 8 - I 9).

Signed: at bottom left MILLET. 95 .PA.67 Louise-Antoinette was painted by Millet around the time of her marriage to the artist's lifelong friend Flix-Bienaime Feuardent, a clerk in the library in the Norman city of Cherbourg. She would eventually bear fourteen children, one of whom married Millet's eldest daughter, Marie. Her portrait is one of more than thirty painted by Millet between I 840 and I 842, while he resided in Cherbourg. In I 847 Millet abandoned his career as a por- traitist and began painting scenes of peas- ant life, like the Getty Museum's Man uwit/i a Hoe (I862), which won him in- ternational fame. Ambitiously rejecting the hard-edged academicism of contemporary society portraiture made popular by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (French, I780-I867), Millet turned to models in seventeenth- century Dutch painting. This portrait of a quietly contained bourgeois wife has the atmospheric stillness of a work by Gerrit Dou or one by Gabriel Metsu. Relying on simple tonal harmonies, tightly con- trolled line and composition, and fluid, often visible brushstrokes, Millet captured the restrained elegance of this demure, yet self-possessed woman.

CLAUDE MONET French, I840-I926 Wheatstacks, Snow Effect, Morning, I89I Oil on canvas, 64.8 x 99.7 cm (25?2 x 39/4 in.). Signed and dated: lower left Claude Monet '91. 95 .PA.63 This is one of thirty paintings that com- prised Monet's first and grandest series devoted to the exploration of a single motif. Painted between fall of I890 and summer of I89I, nearly two-thirds of the wheatstack canvases depict winter scenes. Monet received tremendous popular and critical acclaim when he exhibited fif- teen works from the series at the Galerie Durand-Ruel, Paris, on May 4, I89I. He completed Vheatstacks, Snow Effect, Morn- ing in February I89I and sold it four months before this famous exhibition. From the outset Monet conceived and planned the wheatstacks as a series, based on the firsthand observation of stacks of grain located close to his garden at Givemy. Working outdoors, often in frigid temperatures, the artist strove to capture the fleeting effects of light and at- mosphere before returning to the studio to rework these quintessentially Impres- sionist landscapes. Particularly unusual for a painting by Monet, the canvas is unlined and retains all the details and nuances of the artist's touch. It has been exhibited only three times, and remains one of the best pre- served scenes of the entire series.

It is known that by i864 he had settled permanently in Cairo where he became a teacher of drawing and painting in a technical school under the direct supervision of the viceroy Ismail Pasha. However sporadically, Le Gray continued to make photographs, both portraits and architectural studies. His striking image of the Hippostyle Hall of the great temple of Amun at Kamak, on the east bank of the Nile and south of Cairo, is one of many made at that site during the nineteenth century, in part be- cause of the oddity of the leaning column that closes the view down one aisle. (Its displacement was the result of an earth- quake; it has since been righted.) At forty- three-feet tall, the column is one of one hundred and twenty-two of this size, along with twelve mammoth columns of sixty-nine feet that supported the stone roof of Hippostyle Hall, which was built by Seti I and Rameses II in about I300 B.C.

The photographs were once owned by Cameron's daughter and namesake, Julia Norman, and show Cam- eron's consummate skill as a portraitist and her genre and narrative style at its very best. Cameron took up photography in I 863 at the age of forty-eight. A person of prodigious energy and enthusiasms, be- tween I864 and I875 she realized consis- tent annual production and was regularly represented in British and intemational exhibitions of photography. The social milieu in which Cameron and her four sisters moved and thrived was artistic and intellectual, and included many of the most prominent painters and writers of mid-Victorian England. Cameron drew her portrait subjects from her family and from among her friends, such as George Frederick Watts, Alfred Tennyson, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Carlyle, whose achievements she celebrated in monu- mental compositions that penetrate into her sitters' personalities. Her portraits of women were designed to demonstrate their resemblances to the Pre-Raphaelite art for which her sitters were often the models. Aside from portraiture, the bal- ance of her work is either allegorical- based on her wide reading of classic and Christian literature and Renaissance let- ters-or is intended to illustrate the work of Tennyson, principally Idylls of the King. 48. JULIA MARGARET CAMERON British, I 8 1 5-I 879 Lord Overstone, Carbon print, ca. I875 from a negative of i865 22.4 X 24.2 cm (834 X 9V2 in.) 95.XM.54.3 Lord Overstone was a friend and patron of Cameron's who helped her family fi- nancially over a long period and con- tributed more than 6,ooo pounds toward underwriting the cost of her art. Over- stone, a wealthy financier, was one of the most powerful figures in the Victorian banking world; in I 86o he was elevated to the peerage for his contributions in this sphere. He also had a keen interest in the arts and was a prominent collector and philanthropist. One of the great English art collectors of the period, he owned a broad mix of Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and French paintings. This portrait is an im- portant complement to the substantial al- bum of I 12 photographs that Cameron presented Lord Overstone on August S, I 865, as a token of respect for his support and encouragement of her art (84.Xz.I86). Made in I 865 (and printed later in the carbon process), this study captures the es- sential qualities of the subject: his shrewd eye and influential presence.

He finally returns only to find his wife and children living happily without him. He watches them from a distance and, observing their con- tentment, decides not to make his pres- ence known. Cameron chose to illustrate lines taken from an early part of Tennyson's poem, in which the main characters are not yet adults. This choice allowed her to emphasize a blissful and innocent childhood state, readily suggested by the subjects, whose heads are joined in an ex- pression of unsullied affection. Cameron intended this print as a gift for her son-in- law, Charles Norman; she inscribed the mount with the caption, For Charlie Nor- mani wh4o admires my little Enoch.

TAIZO KATO Japanese, I888-I924 Unititled (Man Painting Ship), ca. 1920 Gelatin silver print, 26.6 x 34.3 cm (I0/2 x 13? in.). 95.XM.14 Kato was born in Japan but moved to Los Angeles in 1907 at the age of nineteen and soon became an active member of the city's community ofJapanese artists. He opened a photography studio and gallery on West Sixth Street and was one of the earliest photographers in Southern Cali- fornia to adopt the Pictorialist style. His death at the age of thirty-six cut short a promising career. The sensitive line and softened tones of this composition attest to Kato's Picto- rialist sensibility and his skill in artfully rendering this scene with the elegant economy of form of a master calligrapher. He captures perfectly the athletic, dancer- like pose of the ship painter, conveying the man's agile movement by placing him in the pivotal center of the composition in such a way that his figure appears to be on the brink of rotating at any moment.

The holding complements the extensive Lissitzky archive acquired by the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities in 1995. Lissitzky began using the camera in the 1920S to document his works of art in other media, but in this portrait he uses the medium to create a work of art. During an extended stay in Europe, Lissitzky met Kurt Schwit- ters, a German Dadaist known for his collages and sound poems. To create this portrait, Lissitzky has superimposed sev- eral images, including two photographs of Schwitters reciting, a poster promoting his journal Merz, and an image of the July 1924 issue of Merz on which the two artists collaborated. The resemblance of this photograph to a collage suggests Lis- sitzky's receptivity to Dadaist techniques, although they were at odds with his Constructivist philosophy.

TWENTIETH-CENTURY WOMEN PHOTOGRAPHERS In I995 the Museum strengthened its holdings of work by twentieth-century women photographers, acquiring repre- sentative images by Lola Alvarez Bravo, Ellen Auerbach, Anne Brigman, Florence Homolka, Helen Levitt, Barbara Morgan, Marion Post Wolcott, and Doris Ulmann. The photographs range from celebrated to little-known works and encompass a range of aesthetic approaches as well as media. The Museum's collection includes a modest number of prints by each of these photographers with the exception of Ulmann, by whom the Getty has more than 170 prints. 52. ANNE BRIGMAN American, I869-I950 Figure in Landscape, I923 Gelatin silver print, I8.4 X 23.6 cm (7/4 X 9X/6 in.). Signed and dated: recto print; inscribed: verso print in pencil Photograph by Anne Brigman/ from my personal collection /Louis M. Lewin. 95.XM.73 This print offers a tranquil counterpoint to two previously acquired works by Brigman that are more dramatic in tone. One of the few photographers in the West whose work was championed by Alfred Stieglitz (American, I 864- I 946), Brigman eschewed the polite studio nudes of the other Photo-Secessionists and posed her models in the rugged landscape of the Sierra Nevada. She sought to con- vey in her work the exaltation of mind and soul that she experienced during her visits to the mountains. Her practice of reworking the negative can be seen here in the center foreground, where she has added foliage by hand to create a more harmonious composition. The massing of darkness at the top and bottom of the pic- ture create a sinuous curve of light that runs through the center and echoes the forms of the woman's nude body. The artist's distinctive signature, which in- cludes a bird in flight, appears in the low- er left comer. PROVENANCE: Louis M. Lewin; [Paul M.

Signed and titled: recto mount; artist's wet stamp verso mount. 95.XM.75*3 A group of four vintage photographs by Barbara Morgan acquired in I995 join one photomontage by the artist that is already in the collection. Included in the group are three dance photographs and the 1941 light drawing Pure Energy and Neurotic Man. A vanguard American modernist, Morgan made drawings on photographic paper with a focused light source and cre- ated photomontages that reflect social concerns. In the mid-1930s she discovered modem dance and developed a fruitful re- lationship with Martha Graham and her company. The dancers-including Doris Humphrey, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cun- ningham, and Graham herself-were regular visitors to Morgan's studio, where she inventively met the technical and aes- thetic challenges of photographing bodies in motion. Hawkins, pictured above, joined the company in I938 as its first male dancer, the same year that Graham's American Document premiered in Vermont. Morgan's lighting emphasizes the sculpted forms of Hawkins's torso and captures a moment of stasis in his fluid performance.

This portrait of Walker Evans (American, I903-1975) joins one other work by Levitt in the collection and complements the Museum's considerable holdings of work by Evans as well as the 1995 gift of twenty portraits of Evans from Joan and Clark Worswick. Levitt, known for her vivid images of New York street life, was a close friend of Evans in the late I930s. This portrait of the dapper Evans catches him in a relaxed moment during the year that he and writerJames Agee were fin- ishing the manuscript for Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Levitt frequently ac- companied Evans on country visits to Agee's retreat outside Frenchtown, New Jersey. Inspired to take up photography af- ter seeing work by Henri Cartier-Bresson (French, born I908), Levitt had her first one-person show at the Museum of Mod- ern Art, New York, in I943, and worked as a freelance photographer and film- maker, receiving Guggenheim awards in 1959 and 1960.

Signed and titled verso print; inscribed: An original vin- tage FSA print, with Farm Security Administration wet stamp. 95.XM.47. I The recent acquisition of three Wolcott prints brings the Museum's holdings of work by this artist to twelve. This group from the artist's daughter is an important addition to documentary work in the col- lection by Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Arthur Rothstein, among others. In I938 Wolcott received her first assignment for the Farm Security Administration (FSA), beginning the body of work for which she is chiefly known. For the next several years she traveled alone through the South, Midwest, and Eastem Seaboard of the United States to document the pro- grams of the FSA and create a portrait of small-town America. Her photographs express an appreciation of rural life rather than emphasizing its privations, as did many of her colleagues. In this photo- graph, one from a series made after a bliz- zard in Vermont, Wolcott suggests that in the country human struggle with the forces of nature is balanced by an intimate knowledge of its beauty.

EDWARD WESTON American, I886-I958 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Hollywood, I939 Gelatin silver print, 24.3 x I9.3 cm. ( xv. X 7'Y16 in.). Inscribed: verso print in artist's hand Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Hollywood / Edward Weston. 95.XM.56 In I937 Weston was awarded a two-year grant from the Guggenheim Foundation to make a series of photographs of the West; this photograph is a product of that project. The subject here is a movie set decoration on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer storage lots in Culver City, visited by Weston in January I 93 9. The following year he made a related series at the 20th Century Fox Pictures studios (now called the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corpo- ration in Century City). The influence of Surrealism began to be felt in Califomia in the mid-I930s, and is revealed in Weston's series of pho- tographs of the back lots of Hollywood. In this particular study the artist uses his camera to remove the plaster sculpture from its context by moving in close to the subject and photographing it from below. He draws the viewer's attention to the eccentricity and incongruity of this mannered, colossal figure, enslaved by the weight of its entablature and put into a state of bondage by a network of stor- age ropes.

W 95*XM.48 Before World War II, Renger-Patzsch made sharply focused, uniformly lit, close- up photographs of industrial subjects such as machinery. During the war the photog- rapher's home in Essen was destroyed by Allied bombings, and he moved to the countryside of Wamel, where he lived in a converted eighteenth-century bakery un- til his death. Although he continued to photograph industrial subjects occasion- ally, his aesthetic focus shifted; his work took a dramatic shift from the prosaic to the poetic and he concentrated on photo- graphing rural landscapes. In this lyrical study of the German countryside Renger-Patzsch silhouetted the graceful curves of the tree limbs against the snow-softened geometry of the landscape. Photographed without the camouflage of their leaves, the intricate structures of the trees are revealed as the key subject of this composition. Their dark, coiling limbs wind their way to the sky and dominate the patterns created by the fences and rooftops in the background. PROVENANCE: Private collection; [Aurel Scheibler, Germany]. I /IflI 56 57</page><page sequence="40">124 Acquisitions/1995 co8 WALKER EVANS The Getty Museum's collection of work by this twentieth-century American pho- tographer is the most complete in this country for rare prints from the first two decades of his career, from the 1920S through the I940s. In i995 the Museum acquired a group of 125 prints that com- plement this existing collection most significantly by adding nearly eighty works dating from the ig5os to the I970s. All of this mature work, including studies of seaside New England architecture and equally personal portraits of the photogra- pher/filmmaker Robert Frank and his Nova Scotia home, is relatively unknown to the field. Besides these, rare pre-i9Sos prints are part of this acquisition: an ar- chitectural study made during his Euro- pean sojourn of 1926; the subject of a child's funeral procession on a southern country road; a postcard-format view of the Pressing Club establishment in Vicks- burg, Mississippi; and a group of ten graffiti pictures, perhaps printed from negatives made with or by his friend of the late I930s, Helen Levitt. One of the most interesting aspects of this new acquisition is the inclusion of a large number of unusual, and in most cases unique, prints related to Evan's pub- lished and unpublished Fortune. His asso- ciation with the journal began in I934 and extended over three decades. He served as staff photographer from I 945, special photographic editor from I948, and as one of the magazine's associate editors from the I950S until I965. As a sampling of Evans's photojournalism, re- produced below are three groups of pic- tures representing essays he prepared between I94I and I963. PROVENANCE: [George Rinhart, Litchfieldl, I 974; [Harry Lunn, Washington], 1975; Joan and Clark Worswick, Milibrook, New York, in two acquisitions in the I980s. Bridgeport, 1941 Evans's story on Bridgeport, Connecticut, was his fourth for Fortune before he be- came a full-time member of their staff. He was sent to this formerly depressed indus- trial city to report on the effects of re- cently accelerated wartime production. Evans returned with numerous images from a July parade and images of life on Main Street. The thirteen Bridgeport pic- tures in this acquisition, which join ten other images from this assignment in the Museum's collection, reflect his contin- ued interest in the ritual of parades. They also represent a more significant strain in his work, namely, that of the anonymous portrait. In the winter of I94I he photo- graphed unsuspecting passengers in the New York subway; now, he made more of these individual portraits on a busy street comer, with many of his subjects busy shoppers who were too distracted by errands and traffic to acknowledge his presence. 58.

As he did in Bridgeport, the photographer seems to have established himself in an inconspicuous position. Here, his strategy was apparently to record workers and shoppers squinting into the sun as they passed a plain ply- wood background. Twelve individuals ap- peared in the gridlike arrangement chosen for this essay's typical high-quality gravure reproductions. Of the five Detroit por- traits that the Museum now holds, only one appeared in the final layout (fig. 64, 95.XM.45.42). As was usually the case, there were remarkable outtakes for this as- signment and they are only now coming to light in scattered private collections. 64.

As part of the acquisition of I995, the Getty Museum obtained twenty-nine prints from this series, which originally included at least seventy-eight photographs of men, young and old, in pairs, in packs, and alone. Although there are a good number of anxious Wall Street types in suits, bro- kers and their apprentices, there are also truckers, tour guides, messengers, car- riage drivers, itinerant tool sharpeners, construction workers, shopkeepers, rail- road workers, and neighbors playing a game of pick-up basketball. Costume, or what men of all ages were wearing on the street in the early I960s, may have been the declared subject of this pro- jected essay, but the body language of these friends and strangers is of equal in- terest in Evans's work. The dress and manners of the anonymous man on the street was clearly a favorite theme for Evans, one that he took up in the late I920S and pursued for more than four decades in Havana, Sarasota, Chicago, Bridgeport, Detroit, and New York. % I iA 64 I (4 *-/gN s~~ _65 66 a 67</page><page sequence="43">Photographs 127 67.

Although the Museum possesses a number of interior and exterior views of Victorian houses Evans made on those excursions (and which were exhibited in 1933 at the Museum of Modem Art, New York), this is the only image of Victorian sculpture from the first decade of his work in the collection. It is important because Evans would return to the subject of memorial sculpture many times during his years of work on the road. The Museum's collection includes later, more well- known images by Evans of funereal monu- ments as varied as rural graves in Hale County, Alabama; Civil War monuments from the National Military Park, Vicks- burg, Mississippi; and nineteenth-century tombs commemorating William Faulkner's ancestors in Ripley, Mississippi.

The prints in this group range from 2Y2 x 3/2 inches to 8 x io inches, and include an early black-and- white Polaroid print, as well as three color portraits from I97I. They date from the late 1930S to I974, picturing Evans work- ing in New York in the offices of Fortune magazine, holding forth at Yale University in the classroom, and walking the beach at the Old Black Point Association in Connecticut, a favorite haunt in his last years. One of the few anonymous works in the group, this portrait was probably made by a Fortune colleague in their lay- out room; it dates from about the time a written profile on Evans was published in the magazine that described him as a "freewheeling cameraman," and praised both the pictures and prose he had sub- mitted for its pages.

FREDERICK SOMMER Photographs In I995 the Museum was fortunate to re- ceive a gift of seventeen photographs from Frederick Sommer (American, b. I905), works that were made by him in I935. Sommer has been producing photographs of extraordinary vision for six decades. A philosophical and artistic radical with an authentically Surrealist sensibility, Sommer is responsible for having ex- panded the conventional definitions of photography. Bom in Italy in I905, Sommer was raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he was instructed in the arts of drawing and design from an early age by his father. In I925 he came to the United States and studied for a master's degree in landscape architecture at Cornell University, where he met his future wife, Frances. After sojourns to Brazil and Europe, Sommer moved to Prescott, Arizona, in February I935, where he still resides today. Coming to photography from the worlds of architecture, drawing, and painting, Sommer brings to his art a com- mitment to structure and problem solving. Taking up photography in 1930 while he was recovering from tuberculosis in Arosa, Switzerland, Sommer purchased two cam- eras, both of which were designed for use with 2? x 3V4 inch glass negatives, and be- gan to develop and print his own pho- tographs-primarily contact prints on toned printing out paper. This group of works, all contact prints dated 1935, are the earliest surviv- ing photographs by Sommer in existence, and the only prints that he ever made from the corresponding negatives. They demonstrate his inscrutable attention to the photographic image as a design prob- lem, and manifest his belief in the objec- tivity of the camera as a tool to describe and record surfaces. In these works a highly structured composition is com- bined with meticulous attention to detail, manifesting Sommer's credo that each photographic print be an object of su- preme craftsmanship. This group com- plements two important donations made by the artist to the Museum last year; eleven photographs by Eugene Atget (French, I857-1927) and thirty-four unique objects used in assemblages that he photographed. 75.

Inscribed: initialed and dated verso mount at center F.S. 1935 in pencil. 95.XM.19.IO Sommer's proclivity toward the structural aesthetics of the natural environment was first awakened when, as a young man, he observed the activities of his father's land- scape firm and nursery in Rio de Janeiro. Soon after he settled in Arizona in I935, Sommer embarked on a series of pho- tographs that explore the aesthetic poten- tial of the structural complexities inherent in nature. Using a small, hand-held cam- era, he examined commonplace subjects and created thoughtful, exacting composi- tions that reveal the intricacies of nature. In this study his ostensible subject is a small, dark flower that appears in the lower left center of the composition. Its environment, however, is also home to a network of fauna and vegetation, whose vitality is rendered almost overpowering by the artist's chosen point of view.

I9. 13 During his wanderings in the desert near his home in Prescott, Arizona, Sommer studied an array of elements in nature and transformed them into photographs of abundant descriptive power. He organizes the features of the natural world on a miniature glass-plate negative, crystallizing his photographic expression in a gemlike contact print with rich shadow detail and fine silvery highlights. Taking a close-up vantage point, in this example Sommer presents the fissured surface of a granite rock, peppered with lichen. Contrasting textures and surfaces provide the emotive power of the picture; the aesthetic possi- bilities of miscellaneous surfaces have re- mained an enduring interest for Sommer, and have served as a rich source in his photography for the display of the abstract potential in natural forms. PROVENANCE: Gift of the artist, Prescott. Drawings and Collages While primarily known as a photogra- pher, Frederick Sommer has simultane- ously pursued the creative possibilities of drawing and collage since the early I930s. His productions in these media represent a large part of his artistic achievement. Sommer's first one-man exhibition, at the Increase Robinson Gallery, Chicago, in I934, was devoted exclusively to his water- colors. Throughout his career, drawing and collage have proved fertile ground for the exploration of his principle concerns of pictorial logic and visual poetry. Draw- ing, in particular, allows Sommer to pur- sue fluid investigations of pictorial form, which he considers the ideal preparation for seeing and understanding problems of an aesthetic nature. Sommer's consummate facility in col- lage allows for the ongoing transforma- tion of preferred subjects according to the artist's vision. In recent years he has been more active in this medium than in any other. Sommer has stated that "A pic- ture is a fact in logical space," and despite the wide-ranging associations of his col- lages, visual logic remains a constant. The materials he uses are primarily taken from lithographic plates reproduced in nine- teenth-century textbooks illustrating human anatomy. In the cutting and ar- rangement of these anatomical elements, Sommer composes intricate, multirhyth- mic compositions that are often vehicles for highly provocative metaphors. 77.

I According to Frederick Sommer, "Space and shape make a beautiful drawing"; these considerations are preeminent char- acteristics of his work in this medium. The viewer is always acutely aware of the attention paid by the artist to the ways that shapes and forms can be deposited on the surface of a sheet of paper. The simul- taneously fluid and staccato outlines of this drawing are combined with applica- tions of gouache, thoughtfully worked into the extremities of the interior field. Most of Sommer's drawings reveal a Sur- realist sensibility, and as a body of work they suggest the great and enduring effect that the medium of drawing has had on his seeing and his art.

Sommer's collages employ nineteenth- century medical illustrations of human anatomy, which are arranged in multi- layered compositions, and celebrate the interrelatedness of nature and the indi- viduality of its different elements. This work is held together by an elaborate net- work of forms and lines, the arrangement of which suggests three-dimensional asso- ciations. While there is often no central focal point to Sommer's collage composi- tions, their contoured edges redirect the eye toward the center. In this example the central, compelling motif is the head of a child, bisected to reveal an imaginary anatomy of the brain.

Pilgrim Flask French (Puisaye area of Burgundy), early sixteenth century Cobalt-glazed stoneware; H: 33.5 cm (1 3/1., in.); W: 23.1 cm (94 in.); D: 12.8 cm (5y in.) 95.DE. I This flask is one of the most important surviving pieces ofgres bleu de Puisaye, the earliest stoneware produced in France for aristocratic patrons. A number of Puisaye stoneware objects display royal heraldry, including the arms of such important French families as the Bochetel, Rolin, Ferri&amp;res, and de la Chaussee. The pro- duction ofgres bleui de Puisaye-so-called because of its brilliant cobalt-oxide glaze, probably imported from the Middle East-has been traced to the last quarter of the fifteenth century when Fran,ois de Rochechouart, chamberlain of the duc d'Orl&amp;ans and of the future Louis XII, married Blanche d'Aumont and estab- lished a stoneware factory in Saint'Amand. l)'Aumont, a native of the Beauvais region where stoneware was being produced from at least the mid-fifteenth century, might have helped bring the technology of stoneware production to the Puisaye.

Inscribed: on the top Di Laura Visconti 95.DA.8 I One of the most renowned Italian furni- ture makers of his day, Maggiolini's work influenced cabinetmakers during his life- time and beyond. Rather than being an innovative creator of furniture forms, he was especially skilled in a type of elegantly designed and masterfully executed mar- quetry in the Neoclassical style, such as seen on this table. He achieved success in the highest circles and produced furniture for such patrons as Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, King Stanislao Poniatowski of Poland, Empress Maria Theresa of Aus- tria, and Duchess Maria Amalia of Parma, as well as for the Napoleonic and Russian courts. Original drawings for this work's tabletop and for one of its legs are among the papers included in the Maggiolini Archive of the Castello Sforzesco, Milan. These papers originate from the workshop of the artist himself.

The chairs display several distinctive features, however, in- cluding the splayed legs, the elegant geo- metric pattems of intarsia that recall a type of early Florentine pietre dure inlay used to ornament panels of furniture, and the use of colorful and exotic hardwoods. Such seventeenth-century Italian chairs- particularly in sets and of comparably in- ventive design, precious materials, and technical expertise-are extremely rare.

Side Table Italian (Sicily), mid-eighteenth century Silver gilt limewood with a limestone top; I04 x I83 x 78 cm (4I x 72 x 30-Y4 in.) 95.DA.6 The eccentric elaboration of Rococo ele- ments on this unusually grand side table- the "skirted" feet, large pierced rail cartouche, bifurcated legs, and "taut" stretchers reminiscent of pulled taffy- suggest this table was made in Italy, par- ticularly Sicily, rather than anywhere north of the Alps. In the North the Rococo style emphasized ethereal forms and ornament whereas Italian works gave importance to an object's structure, ani- mated rather than subsumed by its deco- rative elements. In addition the silver gilt surface on a rich bole ground, which probably included a mecca, or gold-colored vamish (now lacking), is a treatment found most often in southern Italy and was em- ployed as a sort of poor man's gold.

I -.4 Each of these four examples is composed of a solid ebony octagonal panel inset with nine round lastrae (slices) of ancient hardstone specimens, each within a smaller hexagonal frame with molded profile. The shape and decoration of these nineteenth-century panels derive from a type of Italian Renaissance intarsia table- top of octagonal form. The panels may have decorated a room, such as a study, in a nineteenth-century Italian palace, or as portable examples of pietre dure inlay, they may have served as Grand Tour sou- venirs for tourists returning from Flo- rence. These panels differ from other, more scientifically oriented specimen plaques in their emphasis on the colorism and decorative qualities of the stones.

GIROLAMO DELLA ROBBIA Italian, 1488-I566 Bust of a Man, I 526- 3 5 Glazed terra-cotta, H: 46.4 cm (W8/4 in.) 95.SC.2 I This bust belongs to a series produced by Girolamo della Robbia for the Chateau d'Assier in the south of France, which was built from 1526 to I535 by Jacques, called Galiot, de Gourdon de Genouillac (1465- 1 546), a celebrated soldier and grand ecuyer to King Francis I (r. 15I5-47). The quad- rangular castle displayed glazed terra-cotta portrait medallions in high relief on the second story of the courtyard facades. Of the three other known, surviving medal- lions in glazed terra-cotta, one likely rep- resents the emperor Constantine and another Alexander the Great. The classi- cizing armor and drapery of the Getty bust suggest that it, too, depicts an ancient Roman ruler or Gallic hero. The portrait would have been set into a round frame or wreath and, with its reflective white glaze and expressive modeling, would have created a striking contrast with the flat, gray walls of the chateau. The Head of a Man recalls portrait medallions produced just a few years earlier by the Florentine della Robbia workshop for the Certosa in Val d'Ema, which Girolamo must have seen during his brief return to Flo- rence in 1525.

The mythological god Mercury, son ofJupiter and Maia, was the divine messenger and patron of travel, commerce, science, and thievery. Depicted as an athletic youth stepping forward, Mercury wears winged sandals, a winged helmet, and carries his magic staff, the caduceus. The extended left arm, the turn of the head, the walking pose, and the modeling of the torso indicate that van der Schardt based his Mercury on an ancient Roman sculpture, the Apollo Belvedere.

I635-40 Gilt bronze, H: 54.3 cm (21- in.); W: 28.8 cm (i iS in.). Inscribed: on the reverse in a later hand Francesc[us] Mochii. 95 .SB.2 The relief depicts Christ crucified, Mary and John standing to either side, and Mary Magdalene kneeling and em- bracing the foot of the cross. The elon- gated, rectangular shape and large size of the relief, as well as the gilding, keyhole, and hinges, indicate that it functioned as the door of a sacrament tabemacle. Such tabernacles were placed on the main altars of churches and could rise as high as fif- teen feet above the ground; this placement explains the use of foreshortening in the composition, which is meant to be seen from below. The relief is attributed to Francesco Mochi, a contemporary and ri- val of the Roman Baroque sculptors Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Alessandro Algardi. The attribution is based on the relief's stylistic similarities with Mochi's bronze reliefs for the equestrian monuments of Ranuccio and Alessandro Farnese in Pia- cenza (I6I2-29). Its dating is based on a comparison with the marble Saint Veronica, which Mochi carved in the I630s for the crossing of Saint Peter's in Rome. The re- lief also reflects Mochi's experience of contemporary Roman painting; the com- position has a direct prototype in Guido Reni's altarpiece of the Crucifixion, com- pleted in I639 for the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.

Inscribed: at the base of the tree stump ANT CANOVA / VENET FACIEB./ 1781. 95.SA.7I This statuette was the first marble Canova executed in Rome and marks a critical turning point in his stylistic development. While still a visitor in Rome from Venice, Canova was asked by Don Abbondio Rez- zonico, nephew of Pope Clement XIII, to execute a figure of Apollo. Canova's figure was intended to demonstrate his study and assimilation of the famous an- cient sculptures in Rome, as well as his progress away from a late Baroque or Rococo aesthetic and toward a Neoclassi- cal ideal of beauty and composition. Canova's statuette, which was judged in competition with a figure of Minerva, now lost, by the Roman sculptor Giuseppe Angelini, was favorably received by Rez- zonico and helped launch Canova's career. In order to concentrate fully on the de- piction of a heroic male nude based on ancient prototypes, Canova selected a rela- tively calm moment in Ovid's dramatic story of Apollo and Daphne (Metamor- phoses 1.557- 59). Having lost his love Daphne, who was transformed into a lau- rel tree, Apollo crowns himself with laurel and laments, "Since you cannot be my bride, at least you will be my tree. My hair, my lyre, my quiver will always be entwined with you, 0 laurel."

FRANCESCO ANTONIO FRANZONI Italian, 1734- I 818 Modelfor a Fireplace Overmantle, ca. I789 Terra-cotta, H: 5 3.5 cm (2 I V,6 in.) 95.SC.77 Francesco Antonio Franzoni was one of the most important sculptors and restorers of antique sculpture in late eighteenth- century Rome, where he worked on pa- pal and aristocratic commissions. This is a terra-cotta sketch, or bozzetto, for a marble overmantle presumably to be placed above the fireplace in a second- floor drawing room of Palazzo Braschi in Rome, the family palace of Pope Pius VI (r. 1775-99). It takes the form of a relief panel in the shape of a frame (intended to hold a mirror in the finished overmantle) set on a narrow ledge, which is a later restoration. Military trophies are displayed along with two putti, a lion, an eagle, and papal insignia. A late eighteenth-century newspaper reports that the Braschi fire- place was in Franzoni's Roman workshop, confirming the attribution of this sketch to the artist. A nineteenth-century photo- graph shows that Franzoni did complete the marble overmantle, which is now lost. The form of the overmantle may have been influenced by the work of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who illustrated many elaborate, classicizing designs for fire- places in his Diverse maniere d'adornare i Cammini (Rome, I769).

British, I807-I877 Bust of Mary Seacole, I 859 Marble, H: 66 cm (26 in.). Inscribed: at the back H. Weekes, A.R.A./Sc. 1859. 95 .SA.82 This bust most likely represents Mary Jane Seacole (nee Grant; I805-I88I), a Jamaican woman of mixed race who be- came famous in Britain for her activities as a tireless, compassionate nurse to Bri- tish soldiers during the Crimean War. Weekes, a student of Sir Francis Chantrey and, later, a professor at the British Royal Academy, conceived his portrait of Seacole in exotic terms, placing her image on a naturalistic socle of tall, delicate leaves, as if she were a sort of mysterious blossom or plant. Seacole's features, which are known from other representations of her in drawings and prints, have been ideal- ized and rendered more youthful. The combination of whimsical and naturalistic elements in the Bust of Mary Seacole make it Weekes's most inventive portrait.

JEAN-BAPTISTE CHATIGNY French, I834-I886 Head of SaintJohn the Baptist, I 869 Bronze, Diam: 43.5 cm (I71/8 in.); Depth: 20.4 cm (8 in.). Inscribed: at lower left J. Chatigny / 1869 Lyon. 95 .SB.78 Trained in Lyons at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts, Chatigny worked in Paris and re- turned to his native city for the last two decades or so of his life. His close associa- tion with the painter-philosopher Paul- Joseph Chenevard (I807-I895) and with leading Lyonnais theosophists like Adrien Peladan pere (I 8 I 5 - I 890) place Chatigny within the sphere of nineteenth-century occultism. His interest in mystical subject matter is exemplified by his iconic treat- ment ofJohn the Baptist and his emphasis on the sublime aspects of death. John's gaunt face, with its slightly open eyes and parted lips, and his abundant hair, which seems almost to dissolve into the platter that contains it, convey an image of tran- scendence and surrender rather than suf- fering. The loose, sketchy treatment of the surface, which anticipates the work of Auguste Rodin (i 840- I 917), further dis- tances the image from the everyday, real world. Chatigny cast his sculpture with a hole at the top, indicating its intended display as a wall relief. PROVENANCE: [Andre Lemaire, Paris]; [David and Constance Yates, New York]. BIBLIOGRAPHY: M.
