THE first decade of the twentieth century has its intel- lectual physiognomy, as does every century and indeed every year. If, however, we desire to comprehend the basic movements that dominate contemporary intellectual life, we must extend our survey and interpret these movements in rela- tion to the past. Taking this larger historical area into account, contemporary philosophy is an attempt to reconstruct on a new foundation the universalism of antiquity. The ancient philosophy, Indic as well as Greek, was essentially universalistic, i. e., the opposition be- tween subject and object, between psychical and physical, dis- appears in the ultimate unity of the world. Its point of departure is neither the ego nor its counterpart, the non-ego, but the totality, which comprehends in itself both ego and non-ego. The Christian middle-ages established the fundamental dualism of subject and object, and the modern philosophy of nature is based on this antithesis; one of its essential aims is to exclude from the conception of the object every factor originating in the subjective sphere, i. e., all anthropomorphism. The physical world is a completely self-contained, independent system, ex- plicable by its own laws, a pure mechanism. Reaction against this extreme objectivism appeared as early as Leibniz and Berke- ley, whose ideas threatened to modify the notion of psychical and intellectual. When, on the one hand, the Kantian philos- ophy brought the objectivistic, purely naturalistic point of view to its extreme expression, it prepared the way, on the other hand, for the transition to a new stage of development through its critical determination of the insuperable limits of the mathe- Translated from the German by Professor Wm. A. Hammond. 499</page><page sequence="2">500 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. matical-mechanical area. This movement was furthered by Rousseau and especially by Goethe and the Romantic theories. A profounder principle of union between subject and the external world was sought. Nature is not regarded in contemporary thought, as a naively anthropomorphized system, but as a living, intrinsically active whole, not a mechanism but an organism; and here it is that we find the kinship between contemporary thought and ancient universalism. The rigid dualism between subject and object is resolved in a higher, universal unity. Un- doubtedly Goethe went too far in his condemnation of the mathematical, mechanical, analytical method, which had estab- lished this dualism and had converted it into an absolute. The legitimate, permanent content of his philosophy finds expression in philosophical romanticism, especially in the philosophy of Schelling. The centre of gravity is here placed in the objective universe. Fichte's world-ego had already burst the individual's shell and expanded it into a cosmic principle. Schelling and, later, Hegel take as their starting point the absolute, which generates out of itself the whole of reality, subjective as well as objective. Their concept of the absolute is, to be sure, a notion with essentially differentiated implications, a notion that does not eliminate the distinction between physical and psychical, but permits them to persist in undiminished significance. The establishment of a world-formula, which shall be neither one-sidedly subjective nor one-sidedly objective, adapted to include within itself all kinds and degrees of being, continued to be the great problem of the i9th century. The solution of the problem was not sought exclusively in philosophical romanti- cism. While this solution had its origin in Kant, another method, that of positivism, is traceable to Hume. The world-formula of positivism says: " Everything is appearance and there is nothing beyond sensible appearance." There is no metaphysical distinc. tion between the physical and the psychical; both are phe- nomenal complexes which differ from one another exclusively in composition and grouping. Mach and Avenarius have de- veloped this doctrine with the greatest consistency. Under positivism, in the wider sense, is to be classified neo-Kantianism,</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN x9zz. 501 in so far as it undertakes to eliminate the notion of the thing-in. itself and to establish a pure phenomenalism. A distinction, however, is to be noted in the fact that neo-Kantianism aims at the establishment of an absolute, which it seeks not in a metaphysical but in a logical principle. Neo-Kantianism sets a limit to the principle of relativity in constant, unambiguous, intellectual values. In this philosophy of values we see again an universalistic trend, for values are ascribable neither to a subjective nor to an objective reality. They represent a higher, a 'third' realm of self-contained postulates, independent of all reality. This is the fundamental trend of modern logicism, which has acquired significance and currency not merely by its narrower relation to Kant. The interest in metaphysics is constantly on the increase. The most recent philosophy has returned to the problem of being and to the search for a comprehensive, an universal concept, especially in a spirit akin to romanticism. The ultimate union of things is not to be sought in the fact that all sensible reality is phenomenal, but in the fact that everything flows from the same metaphysical source. We note this tendency in the most recent and distinctive philosophical movements, in neo-Hegelian- ism and in the intuitionalism of Bergson; a cross-section of contemporary thought would show the constant shifting of the centre of gravity from the logical to the metaphysical. One of the most notable philosophical events of the past year was undoubtedly the fourth International Philosophical Congress, which held its sessions in Bologna from the sixth to the eleventh of April, under the presidency of Professor Enriques. The part taken by German scholars in this congress was relatively small. Ktilpe, Leonard Nelson and Graf Keyserling were prominent. Kiilpe gave a careful, finely analyzed presentation of the doc- trine of the real in its several stages of development. The ten- dency in the development of the concept of the real is gradually to eliminate the metaphysical in favor of concrete penetration into the sensibly given. Nelson's address on The Impossibility of Epistemology was a condensed presentation of the main theses of his published work on Das sogenannte Erkenntnisproblem. The</page><page sequence="4">502 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. positive outcome of his discussion was insistence on immediate knowledge, i. e., of the real, as the knowledge of logical truth, a position which he opposed to the theories of mediate, re- flective thought, thought vested in judgment. In this respect Nelson approximates in a definite way the standpoint of in- tuition, represented by Losskij and Bergson. Keyserling's ad- dress on Metaphysical Reality offered nothing beyond an extract from the main chapter of his work Prolegomena to the Philosophy of Nature, published in i9ii. The address was nevertheless interesting, because of its noteworthy difference from the views of the other German philosophers. Keyserling stands entirely aloof from the transcendental movement; he is a biological meta- physicist. His central concept is that of life. In this respect he approximates on the one hand pragmatism, and on the other hand the doctrine of Bergson. According to Keyserling there is no 'third realm' of values; metaphysical reality is life, which eludes all physical explanation, especially all mechanistic explana- tion. If logical values, and in general all intellectual values, are only the products of ceaselessly generative life, then they must be subject to the relativity of Becoming, and the conceptual structure of philosophy must lack all fixed and absolute criteria. Consequently Keyserling's theory, as every other theory of this type, lacks all stable foundation. One can very well hold to the transcendental point of view and nevertheless avoid the blind alley into which modern logicism, with its doctrine of the exclu- sively conceptual character of being, has strayed. One can, as a matter of fact, unite an intuitive epistemological doctrine with transcendentalism, as demanded in Bergson's masterly address on The Spirit of Philosophy. I would even say that the funda- mental problem of the philosophy of the future lies just in the reconciliation of the transcendental and metaphysical points of view. Most of the advocates of pragmatism make the same mistake as Keyserling. At the Bologna Congress, Schiller of Oxford defended pragmatism with the same arguments employed by him at the Heidelberg Congress three years earlier. Schiller's address on Error was, therefore, mainly a repetition of the contro- versy awakened by his paper at the earlier Congress. He has</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN iaiz. 503 brought his main theses together in a volume entitled Humanism,' which has been translated into German as a contribution to the philosophy of pragmatism. When Schiller maintains that the primary criterion of falsity is annulment of presupposition by consequences, extreme pragmatism is justly exposed to the charge of absurdity. Does his theory lay claim to merely conditional epistemological value? Does it not at least presuppose the un- conditional validity of the laws of logic? It does, as a matter of fact, make quite specific and unambiguous predications regarding reality, which cannot be refined away without throwing the theory itself overboard. It postulates that there is a world of objects and a world of subjects which react upon objects by a uniform law; one of these fixed and purposive forms of reaction is what we call truth or knowledge. One sees the evident circle in which the theory moves, when it undertakes to account for ultimate truth and knowledge. If pragmatism or humanism is a philosophy of orientation, it must assume that there is a uni- formly established reality, for orientation is possible only in a real world of such uniformity. The transformation of axioms into postulates, demanded by Schiller, is limited at least by those axioms whereby the logical process of such transformation is accomplished. Furthermore, the concept of biological adapta- tion is employed by the pragmatists in varying senses, some- times in a narrow, material sense, and at other times in much wider, ideal senses. The application of the category of ideality to sensible phenomena is regarded by Schiller as a vital necessity, no less than is belief in personal immortality and a moral world- order. Between what the Darwinian theory of selection char- acterizes as postulates of conduct and Kant's postulates of the practical reason, there is a tremendous interval and the philos- ophy of pragmatism must measure this with critical precision, if it is to lay any claim to a strict epistemological basis. One must mention here the address, presented in a section of the Congress by the distinguished Indologist Paul Deussen, concerning his complete edition of Schopenhauer's works in ten 1 Philosophisch-soziologische BUcherei, Vol. XXV, translated by R. Eisler, and published by W. Klinkhardt, Leipsig, I9II, pp. xv, 400.</page><page sequence="6">504 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. volumes. In connection with the address, prospectuses were circulated regarding Deussen's monumental work: Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie,l giving an outline plan of the entire work, including the unpublished parts. The first part, in three volumes, now complete, contains the philosophy of India. The second part, to be published in three volumes, will treat of the philosophy of Europe. Of this second part, the first division, covering the philosophy of the Greeks, has already appeared. The last division will cover biblical-medieval and modern philos- ophy. Deussen's fundamental view-point is clearly seen in his discussion of Greek philosophy. Epistemology recedes into the background; the primary interest is metaphysics, and the bias of the Indian doctrine of Atman is apparent. Nevertheless, Deussen is just in his treatment of the peculiar genius of Greek philosophy, the systems of which are more sharply differentiated than in the Indian philosophy. Closely connected with Kant and neo-Kantianism is a series of articles in the Kantstudien. Amongst these I wish to call attention to Cassirer's essay on Aristoteles und Kant, which is a criticism of G6rland's work on the relation of Aristotle and Kant to the notion of theoretical knowledge. Two fundamental tendencies in philosophy are evident here: Aristotle starts with the fact, with the substantial, and proceeds from this to relations: Kant pursues the opposite course; relation is the factor of primary importance in the critical philosophy; things are merely bearers of relations,- a mode of thought which corresponds with the idea of a complete system. This explanation and evaluation of the critical philosophy is evidently closely connected with the views which dominate Cassirer's work on Substanzbegriff und Funktions- begriff. In a later part of this report I shall discuss the article of Driesch on the Category of Individuality and Ebbinghaus's essay on Benedetto Croce's Hegel. A very important undertaking of the Kant-Gesellschaft is the publication of reprints of such writings as have affected the de- velopment of intellectual life in the last two centuries, and which I Munich, The Pipera Co.</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN zgxx. 505 in spite of their indispensability have become obsolete in the book trade. In this series there has been planned the publication of twenty-five volumes. The first volume to appear is the well- known work of E. G. Schulze entitled Aenesidemus oder uiber die Fundamente der vom Professor Reinhold in Jena gelieferten Ele- mentarphilosophie, edited by Dr. Arthur Liebert. The argu- ments adduced in this work against the critical philosophy and not merely against Reinhold's exposition of the same, are worthy of careful consideration today because of their profound insight. It is here apparent, a fact remarked upon by Vaihinger in his Commentar, that many questions which confront recent Kantian study, had been thrashed out long ago, and as a matter of fact, so far as orientation in the subject is concerned, frequently better and more clearly than in later writings. Skepticism, as held by the author (Schulze), does not negate the postulate of a primary point of departure for philosophy. He finds, however, such a point of departure exclusively in the imme- diate facts of consciousness and in the principles of formal logic. Predication concerning the nature of things in themselves, on metaphysical reality, and on the absolute competency of the human epistemological faculty is, on the contrary, impossible, and constantly leads astray into the blind alley of dogmatism. Kant's fundamental mistake is held to be a violation of his own principle: the transition from what must be thought to what must be real. From the fact that the necessary synthetic judg- ments can arise only from the mind, is deduced in an over-hasty fashion the conclusion that the mind is also in reality the source of the same. This conception of criticism is evidently psycholo- gistic, and, as a matter of fact, Reinhold never got beyond the standpoint of psychology. Within this narrow compass, one must, however, admire the keen insight with which the inade- quacies of the new doctrine, which in many quarters was then fanatically advocated, were exposed. The work of Bruno Bauch entitled Studien zur Philosophie der exaccten Wissenschaften' is closely related to the philosophy of criticism. There are five important studies combined in the volume: (i) on the relation of philosophy to natural science; (2) 1 Heidelberg, Winter's Universitdtsbuchhandlung, I9iI, pp. viii, 262.</page><page sequence="8">5o6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. on the problem of universal experience; (3) experience and ge- ometry in their epistemological relations: (4) criticism and natu- ral philosophy in the system of Otto Liebmann; (5) the analysis of the problem of substance and the logical arrangement of the points of view. The several studies concern chiefly epistemo- logical and methodological problems. In the first study the rela- tion between the inductive and deductive methods is investigated, an inquiry which aims to show that the distinction between induc- tion and deduction is not an absolute one, neither is it rejected as conventional and artificial. As factors of 'resolution' and 'composition,' they supplement and interpenetrate one another in the analytical method. Especially in the investigation of nature, this reciprocal relationship is apparent. "If we have regard not merely to the external procedure, but to the internal structure of the inductive method, it will be seen that this pro- cedure acquires its significance and its possibility only through a rigid, logically uniform, articulation; it will be seen that induction does not proceed merely from particular to universal, but that it does and can do this only under the presupposition of an univer- sal, which has for the method the significance of a general internal law, and this internal law makes the external procedure possible. One must, therefore, observe that induction has an universal not merely for its end, but, quite as much as deduction, has an universal for its presupposition. This presupposition of an universal in induction may be characterized as the deductive factor in induction." One could not make the transition from particular to universal, unless from the very start one were in possession of a fixed notion of orientation, in terms of which the separate examples are classified. Thought expresses in this sub- sumption and arrangement, indeed, its most peculiar property. It rediscovers itself in nature, so that the problem presented in inductive investigation comes back in the last analysis to the problem of the harmony between being and thought, i. e., to the problem of the interpretability of nature. Bauch undertakes to solve the problem by postulating the empirically given, i. e., the factor independent of the subject, as itself a logically necessary pre- supposition, through which alone the objectivity of the investi-</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN r9z. 507 gation of nature is guaranteed. The uniformity of form is thus made to include the uniformity of content. The extension of a priori form to content, which characterizes the most recent phase of neo-Kantianism, represented by Cassirer, Cohen, and Natorp, is employed also by Bauch, in a manner, of course, that bears a more empiristic stamp. This position is also evident in the other essays, a position which is polemically opposed no less to a vague positivism, a philosophy of pure factuality, than it is to an exaggerated dialectic of the concept. The second essay aims to show that experience is in no wise to be regarded as a given, but as a problem. Not even is the ultimate sensible substrate of experience, the manifold, absolutely given, as if it stood outside of relationship to logical activity. On the contrary, experience demands this logical factor in order thereby to unfold. The last essay discusses the historical and systematic bearings of various viewpoints on the evolution of the problem of substance. Development proceeds from the naive realism of the copy-theory to mechanism and materialism, from this to dynamism and the philosophy of energy, then to spiritualism, to positivism, and finally to criticism, in which the abrogation of metaphysics is complete. One scarcely needs to say that Bauch decides for the critical solution of the problem, a fact evident from his general position and particularly from his monograph on the notion of substance, to which I referred in my last year's report. Substance is regarded neither as an external nor as an internal reality, nor as merely reciprocal rela- tion between sensible qualities, but purely as a concept and fundamental postulate. Positivism is decisively rejected. I doubt, however, whether the transcendental investiture of the problem is sufficient to clothe entirely its metaphysical content. Between Bauch and Cassirer there is a good deal of common ground, but also a number of differences. As a convincing sign that the methodological principles of modern epistemology are beginning to find their way into other fields of inquiry, may be cited Kelsen's work Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre.1 It is an attempt, carried out with logical rigor and energy, to apply the principles of transcendentalism to the 1 TUbingen, Mohr, I9II, pp. xxvi, 709.</page><page sequence="10">508 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. philosophy of law. The author takes as his starting point the distinction between norm and law of nature, between what ought to be and what is, between the normative and explicative methods, in order to develop the peculiar factor that determines the prin- ciple of law. This factor is not discoverable at the level of what is (sein), but at the level of what ought to be (sollen). It is falsely characterized as teleological. The causal and teleological viewpoints are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, in every idea of purpose the causal principle is so far included, as its realization is a part of the scheme of cause and effect. Both belong to the sphere of being; both equally lack the character- istic features of the norm, which mark the principle of law. The notion of responsibility is derived from a comparison of the norm with empirical facts, in so far as these facts can be related to a subject. Here the question is not what the subject has done or left undone, but merely what he ought to have done. In the problem of responsibility, the will plays a role which is in no wise completely commensurate with its psychological meaning. Will is interpreted here not as a concrete real process, but as a notional construction; it represents the reference of final respon- sibility to the inner man. It is closely related to the concept of will developed by Cohen in his Ethik des reinen Wollens, a fact readily understood, because Kelsen's method is also anti-psy- chologistic and transcendental. The introduction of these prin- ciples into a territory, which had hitherto been partially closed to them, and rigorous adherence to them, constitute the great merit of the book, for which one could wish a far-reaching in- fluence on the development of the philosophy of law. Reininger's Philosophie des Erkennens' is also inspired by the spirit of criticism. Although this extraordinarily solid work presents the chief movements of epistemology in historical se- quence, its purpose is systematic and critical. This is evident from the introduction on the concept of knowledge and epis- temology. The characteristic mark of knowledge is its relation to object (Gegenstandsbeziehung). While in unreflective expe- rience, idea and object are given as undifferentiated unity, knowl- edge tends constantly to sunder itself from its object and seeks to 1 Leipsig, Barth, i9ii, pp. iv, i64.</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN ixiz. 509 regain the object by copying it. This differentiating factor in knowledge, which establishes at once its dualistic character, is, in its fundamental significance, clearly grasped by Reininger, and is brought into immediate relation with the analysis of conscious- ness into subject and object. Three factors must be distin- guished here; the content of the idea, the feeling of trans-sub- jective necessity, and the reflection which objectifies this feeling and relates it to something outside of the field of the idea. The examination of this trans-subjective factor is the peculiar problem of epistemology. Epistemology may not, therefore, proceed from definite results of knowledge, inasmuch as it aims in a transcen- dental, regressive sense to unmask its presuppositions. This tendency is historically developed in the systems of rationalism, empiricism, and criticism. Every epistemology that lays claim to completeness must reckon with these systems. Reininger does this in a thorough and stimulating way. The valuable ele- ment in his investigation is its restriction to the central factor of the problem: what is meant by knowledge and by what means is it realized? The first attempt to solve this problem is found in rationalism, especially in the rationalism of Descartes, which Reininger ex- plains with fine insight, although he interprets Descartes and the other exponents of rationalism too much through the medium of the critical philosophy. Descartes's epistemology is char- acterized as an attempt to interpret the possibility of rational knowledge through the relation of human thought to the creative cosmic reason. This standpoint is maintained by the rationalism of Spinoza and Leibniz, the latter of whom prepares the way for the critical philosophy by discovering the origin and justifica- tion of the highest rational truths no longer, as Descartes did, in the will, but in the understanding, of God, consequently not in an alien but in a kindred sphere of absolute intellectuality. In a similar way Reininger presents the chief outlines of empiricism, in which he distinguishes a dogmatic and a skeptical element. The empirical philosophy proceed's on a realistic basis to idealistic consequences: that is its inner contradiction, which transcends the system. Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume mark the several stages of this process. Hume adopts a platform,</page><page sequence="12">510 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. already outlined by Bacon, which aims at the maximum objecti- fication of knowledge, involving, however, the dissolution and annihilation of the subject. The result of this is to split up the objective world into a chaos of unrelated fragments. The reduc- tion of the real to the immediately given signifies at once the abandonment of all order and, consequently, of all knowableness of the actual. Hume finds himself, therefore, confronted with the need of a recourse similar to that employed by Descartes, in order to rescue the possibility of knowledge: i. e., he finds anchorage in a transcendent principle which he calls the 'wisdom of nature.' If this principle is logically carried out, it develops into what in Kant is called the 'might of reason,' so that both movements, the empirical and the rationalistic, of themselves, issue in the critical. In his exposition of the Kantian philosophy, Reininger shows himself to be a strict transcendentalist. The most im- portant thing here is the way in which Reininger delimits the transcendental from the metaphysical. The fundamental ques- tion in every theory of experience and knowledge: How is it possible to apply the rational laws of thought to empirical reality and through their application prepare the way for the under- standing of reality? is answered through the notion of transcen- dental apperception. This is a higher viewpoint, above the duality of subject and object, which makes intelligible the fact that the laws of nature are the laws of the understanding. If one calls this transcendental consciousness, in which everything real, subjective and objective, finds its ultimate logical unity the world-reason, one must nevertheless constantly emphasize the fact that no metaphysical significance is to be conjoined with it. It is merely the expression of the perspective character of the ego, of consciousness. It is the impulse to objectify the self as well as external things, the attempt to discover beneath the plane of empirical subjectivity an universal ego, a completely universal consciousness, which in the last resort is nothing but the absolute unity, the universal synthesis. We have here that Bewusstsein iiberhaupt, which takes its bearings from Kant and Fichte, and which in recent epistemology has played an extraordinary rOle. Whether this abstraction is capable of solving the problem of being, of rescuing reality from the consequences of subjective</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN xgII. 5II idealism, is another question. It is at least controverted in the most determined way by Victor Kraft in his work Erkenntisbegriff und Weltbegriff.' The book is a violent protest against every sort of immanence of consciousness, every type of positivism. The notion of positivism, particularly in reference to the problem of the external world, is so broadly defined that it includes not merely the empiristic phenomenalism of Mach and Avenarius, but also transcendental idealism, in so far as being is resolved into knowledge. That the knowledge of nature involves a transcen- dent, extra-conscious principle, a principle of being, is the funda- mental idea of the book. In every system of idealism, reality is conditioned by the factor of consciousness, which clings to it, and this, according to Kraft, contradicts reality. Reality be- comes an attenuated web of phenomena, whose interconnections exhibit no inherent law, but merely rules for the sequence of subjective processes. Kraft is never tired of pointing out this result, and of bringing it into the light from the most varied angles. Whether the arrangement of phenomena is variable, as empiricism maintains, or constant, as the neo-Kantian aprior- ism maintains, in neither case do we get true objectivity, so long as we move in the plane of consciousness. Kraft goes so far as to emphasize the position, in which I am unable uncondition- ally to follow him, that every idealistic position, if logically developed, is condemned to solipsism. In the feeling of absurdity which the latter view awakens in us, we have the surest criterion for the necessity of transcending realistically the sphere of con- sciousness in the philosophical conception of reality. In the further development of this idea, Kraft is a decided dualist. His dualism is metaphysical, a dualism which implies differentia- tion between the thing-in-itself and phenomena. He rejects recent attemps to revive naive realism as the natural world-view, attempts which include the philosophy of immanent conscious- ness, empirio-cricitism, extreme phenomenalism, and also intui- tionalism. Things are not themselves present in our perception. In what sense then they are present is not apparent, inasmuch as every individual content of perception is different from every 1 Leipsig, Barth, I9II, pp. Xii, 232.</page><page sequence="14">5I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. other. The duality between knowledge and being is one which cannot be bridged. It is quite as certain, however, that knowl- edge itself acquires meaning only through its reference to a transcendent being. The reality of the external world is not merely a practical postulate or a content of faith. It occupies an entirely different logical position; it is the expression of a theory. The meaning of a theory lies in the fact that it arranges given phenomena in a rational system. In this sense realism is a theory which alone can construe the subject matter of expe- rience into an orderly complex. And just for this reason it cannot be logically proven. Proof is possible only when reasoning is con- cerned with the analytical knowledge of conceptual relations. The error in the interpretation of reality has consisted in the fact that only two possibilities have been considered: either, knowledge of the real is a predication concerning perceived facts, or it is a derivative from such facts by means of deductive proof. The knowledge of the external world and of its reality-value is attainable in neither of these ways. It cannot be made intelli- gible as a logical result, but only as a presupposition on which rational explanation of perceptual processes must be based, that is, it is a theory. The ultimate presupposition remains, therefore, the conviction of the logically rational character of reality, so that the theory itself finds its anchorage in the principle of faith. Vaihinger's extraordinarily interesting and important work Die Philosophie des 'als ob,' goes far beyond the limits of neo- Kantianism. That the work shows numerous relationships with criticism is almost self-evident, when one considers the person- ality of the author; and these relationships are emphasized. Their nature and tendency will be most clearly understood by bearing in mind that Vaihinger takes his points of orientation less from the AEsthetic and Analytic than he does from the Tran- scendental Dialectic. The doctrine of 'necessary semblance,' with which reality is stamped, is Vaihinger's point of departure and at the same time the central idea toward which all his obser- vations gravitate. The complete title of the book, which, re- garded more precisely, contains his entire program, reads: Die Philosophic des 'als ob,' System der theoretischen und praktischen</page><page sequence="15">No. 5.J PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN i9ii. 513 Fiktionen der Menschheit auf Grund eines idealistischen Positi- vismus.1 Idealism and positivism are, as a matter of fact, the two fundamental principles of the work. These principles are of such nature that at first sight they seem to involve a contradic- tion, which disappears only when the principles are carried out to their logical conclusion. On the one side, Vaihinger's work has a decidedly idealistic character, for it sublimates the most ob- jective knowledge-values into mere symbols or even 'fictions.' On the other side, a realistic positivism, properly speaking, a biological principle, furnishes the basis of this metamorphosis into symbol, i. e., in so far as the fictions are conceived as vital necessities, as means of self-preservation, in so far, in other words, as the living processes of organic beings are regarded as the real substrate underlying knowledge. Let us follow up these trains of ideas, which at first sight appear difficult to harmonize. In philosophical logic the rigid alternative between truth and error has been too persistent. That there is a third possibility, which has played an influential role in the history of human thought, is not sufficiently recognized. This is the notion of fiction, which in a peculiar way reduces the apparently absolute contradiction between truth and error to a matter of relativity, and has the power some how or other of uniting the false with the true, of making the false serviceable to truth. What Vaih- inger here means by 'fiction' is something which is not less dis- tinct from error than it is from truth, and yet it is closely con- nected with both. It is the employment of such concepts as correspond with nothing in the real world, which indeed often contradict reality, and which nevertheless promote the under- standing of the real world and orientation in it. Fiction has always played a very great role in the history of mankind and in the most diverse fields,-in science, art, jurisprudence, and in religious thought. The problem of fiction in this sense appears clearly first in Kant. In reference to transcendental ideas, Kant introduced the point of view that these are not to be re- garded as realities, neither are they for this reason to be elim- inated from philosophy as worthless phantasms. They are 1 Berlin, Reuther and Reichard, igii, pp. xxxv, 804.</page><page sequence="16">514 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. rather to be treated as if (als ob) they were realities, a mode of regard which is to be characterized neither as illusory nor as imaginative, but as fictional. Kant employed them wittingly and as part of his program, but only in a limited field of knowl- edge, the field of metaphysics. They penetrate, however, his whole concept of knowledge, through and through. It awakens no astonishment, therefore, when a thinker like Vaihinger, who is so thoroughly oriented in Kant, carries this conception to its extreme consequences. The most important question raised by him is: How is it possible to attain truth with consciously false ideas? The circle of such ideas receives here an extra- ordinary expansion. Included among them are not merely transcendent notions such as the infinite, atom, matter, energy, the unconscious, but also such categories as substance and cau- sality. This is an interesting turn which gives one pause. If one considers the matter more closely, one will discover that neo-Kantianism, wherever it is at once positivism and phenom- enalism, is forced to develop a similar view of the categories. If the categories mirror no longer any metaphysical reality, whether subjective or objective reality, if they are merely lines of orientation drawn by thought, not of course absolutely con- stant lines, then in the last resort they have only a symbolic character. We think the world causally, i. e., we think it as if (als ob) it were causally planned. We think the world in terms of substance, i. e., we think it as if phenomena severally were referable to a substance as their essential bearer. In calling these concepts 'symbols,' we must bear in mind that they are not symbols of determinate things, but symbols of intellectual activity, which stamps itself on their creation. But how is it possible that such notions, originating as they do without reference to reality, are capable of mediating reality? This is possible only on the presupposition that a meaning differ- ent from the ordinary is associated with the function of knowl- edge. And that is actually the case with Vaihinger. Knowledge for him is in no wise an image of the cosmos, because it is itself an integral part of the cosmos. "The logical processes belong within the series of cosmic events and their primary purpose is</page><page sequence="17">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN i9ii. 515 merely to preserve the life of organisms and to enrich them Their purpose is to serve as instruments in the perfection of the existence of organic beings; they serve as mediating members between organic beings. The world of ideas is a construct adapted to the fulfillment of this purpose, but for this reason to call it an image is an over-hasty and unfitting comparison." Vaihinger here takes the position of biological epistemology, and points out its relationship with recent theories of moderate pragmatism and voluntarism. This conception presupposes, to be sure, a great deal, which, if the theory is to maintain its significance, must not be dissipated in the cloud of fiction. It presupposes that there is a world in which organic beings orig- inate and are developed; it presupposes consequently a relation- ship of temporal sequence, as well as of definite order and uni- formity in this sequence; that is, it presupposes the reality of time and of causality. It even presupposes the reality of space, for in what other medium could these processes take place? Finally, it presupposes the reality of the notion of pur- pose. For this is immediately contained in the assumption, that organic beings react in the interest of self preservation to external stimuli with purposive ideas. We find that a real ego is here silently assumed; for whatever aims to preserve itself, whatever realizes a purpose with definite means, can only be a self, an ego. Consequently, it estranges one from the author when he includes these notions for the most part amongst fictions. He seems thereby to destroy the foundation on which his own theory of fiction is based. There would appear to arise here a contradiction between idealism and naturalistic positivism which cannot be otherwise removed than by treating the prin- ciple of biology, in which positivism finds its expression, as itself fiction. Thereby we would draw the ultimate consequence of this procedure: we would arrive at a standpoint which might be best characterized as perspectivism, a standpoint advocated by Nietzsche and Simmel. Perspectivism is the extreme opposite of every dogmatism. But biological epistemology is dogmatic in the extreme, for it presupposes an entire outfit of notions, which need, first, to be critically examined in reference to the existence</page><page sequence="18">5i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. of their objects. In this sense every relativism, which seeks a constant, fixed point of relation, whether in the ego or in the organic substance, is also dogmatic. It is only when one gives up this centripetal tendency and conceives the world as a totality of perspectives, instead of an unambiguous reality,-each per- spective may represent within itself a closed system but cannot be employed for the explanation of the whole-that dogmatism can be escaped. Such perspectives are especially the fictions which shift according to the selection of the point of view, even though they may possess sufficient constancy for one and the same standpoint. In this view of the world there is no unitary and unambiguous center of being, either in the ego or in the non-ego, in the physical or in the psychical. On the contrary, all things are definable merely in reference to one another. If there is no absolute space, then there can also be no absolute point of orientation in reality; from every point, however, orien- tation concerning the whole is possible in such wise as to cause this orientation to mirror the relativity of the point of survey. By an intentional paradox one might characterize this theory of the world as absolute relativism. Most systems of philosophy conceive the notion of being, however differently they may think it, always as substantial and unambiguous. Ambiguity, on the contrary, lies in the essence of perspectivism. In my opinion, the final outcome of Vaihinger's work is a perspectivism of this sort, and this is attested by its position between Kant's and Nietzsche's doctrine of 'necessary semblance.' The radical abandonment of the doctrine of substance here announced, marks, perhaps, not merely a fundamental tendency in philo- sophical thought, but also in artistic creation,-one might say, indeed, in the entire spirit of contemporary culture. As a special instance, we might cite the relativism of the doctrine of Becoming which has recently found pregnant expression in the philosophy of Bergson. The numerous references made by Vaihinger to related ideas and movements show how deeply the problem raised by him has penetrated into contemporary thought. It might be of especial value to refer to the close kinship between Vaihinger's 'fiction'</page><page sequence="19">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN i9ii. 517 and the peculiar 'psychological field of facts,' which Meinong in his work Uber Annahmen' takes pains to clear up. An assump- tion is something midway between idea and judgment. What distinguishes judgment from idea, is, on the one hand, the factor of conviction, and, on the other hand, its mediating position between the definitely positive and negative. An assumption lacks the element of conviction, the mental attitude toward reality; on the contrary, it has the attributes of affirmation or negation. The circumstance that assumptions can also be nega- tive in character distinguishes them completely from mere idea, whose content can never be a negation. Assumptions apply to the most various fields and not merely to the intellectual. This characteristic is common to assumption and fiction, which, on closer scrutiny, turns out to be a particular kind of assumption. The relation of assumption to play and art is a very interesting part of Meinong's investigation. It corresponds to the 'beautiful semblance,' which is as much removed from the reality of being as it is from nothing. The phenomena of the lie and the question are also brought into the purview of this problem. Meinong investigates further the significance of assumption in the intel- lectual and emotional spheres. Its bearing on the psychology of desire and of value is of more than theoretical significance. At the basis of desire, where the concern is with the content of motive, it is not idea or judgment, but an assumption, that is found. The author also attempts to show an analogy in aesthetic feeling. As assumption lies between idea and judgment, so aesthetic feeling is a mental attitude between an affective state and idea. As assumption shares with judgment the opposition between affirmation and negation, so the aesthetic attitude shares with feeling the opposition between pleasure and dis- pleasure. This peculiar condition of related association, which is fundamentally a projected feeling, is called by Meinong a feeling of phantasy (Phantasiegefiihl). For the concept of assumption, as for the concept of fiction, the determining mark is the fact that the most varied phenomena are included under it, so that off-hand no fixed specific meaning can be assigned to it.

From this standpoint it is certain that psychological and epistemological implications of the greatest moment may be brought to light. We have seen in the course of our observations that the relation of the rational to the irrational, of the conceptual to the manifold of experience, the delineation of the two spheres, plays an extra- ordinary role in modern German philosophy. A subtle investi- gation by Rickert, published in Logos, and entitled Das Eine, die Einheit und die Eins, concerns this problem in its most peculiar sphere, the sphere of number. The logical, as Rickert points out, appears to be threatened in its peculiar sphere through confusion with the mathematical. The differentiation of the spheres is consequently of the greatest importance. Kant kept them rigorously distinct; his successors obliterated the boun- daries in their attempt to deduce the principle of manifoldness from the unitary principle of reason, and neo-Kantianism in that degree in which it has absorbed Hegelian motives, is disposed to repeat this deductive procedure. The most recent works of Cohen and Natorp prove this. Rickert does not unqualifiedly identify the manifold, as such, with the irrational. Only in so far as the manifold is more nearly defined in terms of number, does it disclose essentially alogical factors. The empiristic theory of number is, of course, rejected by Rickert; as transcendentalist he scarcely gives it serious attention. The ideality and apriority of mathematics are unquestioned. At the same time rationalism is wrong in treating number, as it does the notion of identity, from the standpoint of logic. In order to disprove this method, Rickert analyzes in the first place the nature of the logical, an analysis the subtlety of which recalls the fine conceptual deter- minations of Hegel. It is impossible here to reproduce all the shades of his thought; we must confine ourselves to its most essential results. Identity is not the sole basic category in logic. Difference, 'otherness,' is equally fundamental and implied by identity, just as it is of the nature of form to imply content. The ' one ' exists, as such, merely in its relation to the 'other.' Other- ness is not the mere negation of identity; it is just as positive as</page><page sequence="21">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN I9zu. 519 is the 'one,' and is underivable from the one. Rickert char- acterizes this relationship not as antithesis but as heterothesis. Thought cannot move thetically in the form of identical unity, but only heterothetically in the reciprocal action of identity and otherness. The notion of the purely logical is not, however, completely exhausted in this description. Thesis and hetero- thesis become isolated factors only through analysis of the original synthesis. Consequently, the logical ultimate is not absolutely simple, but is at the very start a manifold. But this manifoldness is not a numerical manifoldness, neither is it possible to derive number from it. Above all, the logical 'one' is not the mathe- matical 'one.' For the mathematical one we have the funda- mental equation, one equals one; on the other hand in the realm of logical objects there is no identity at all. For here one cannot, as in the case of numbers, exchange the one with the other, and therefore equate the one with the other. The 'one' is not only different from the 'other,' but at the same time it is only different. To difference there must be some common factor added to provide a ground for sameness. That which is only different can never be the same. The logical medium is different from the medium of number. The former is a heterogeneous medium, which makes possible merely rigid identity and rigid differences; the latter is a homogeneous medium which is the only medium that can be made the basis of sameness. Such a homogeneous medium is that of time, and also space. Here we have given the possibility of an infinitely extended manifold, a mass, and here we find the first alogical factor, which is indispensable for the establishment of number. A further alogical factor becomes evident when we pass from mass to quantity and to arrangement. It is here that one first arrives at the notion of a series and thereby at a system of numbers. The structure of a series rests upon the quantitative unlikeness of numbers. The two alogical properties of number, homogeneous medium and quantitative unlikeness, accordingly delimit unequivocally the mathematical from the logical. This distinction is explained by Rickert in the following way: The logical is not something that is but something that is valid; the mathematical, on the contrary, possesses no empirical being, but it does possess ideal being,-it is unreal, but it is.</page><page sequence="22">520 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. Lask, in his investigation entitled Die Logik der Philosophie und die Categorienlehrel, gives space to the discussion of the irra- tional. Everything that is subsumed under a category is, in so far as it is irreducible to categoric statement, per se irrational, and this is a larger sphere than is commonly supposed. The principle of the Kantian concept of knowledge must, if it is logically applied, be extended beyond the limits assigned by Kant. Not only does the sensible fall under categoric forms, but this is also true of the non-sensible. If being were known only through its reduction to definite categories, then a knowledge of these categories, such as transcendentalism aims to attain, would not be possible otherwise than by bringing them in turn under higher categoric forms. Not only the sensible world, but also philosophy which masters and interprets it, has its own logic, with the investigation of which the author is primarily con- cerned. The material which in itself is irrational must, however, in both instances, in the sensible as in the non-sensible spheres, be sundered from rational form. What is timelessly valid is merely the form; the content is perishable, temporally condi- tioned. If, for example, we take the notion of yellow, and clothe the content 'yellow' with the category of identity, the yellow is not for this reason raised to the sphere of ideal timelessness. It acquires no ideal content, as it might in the case of the Platonic doctrine of ideas and in many recent theories; it remains empir- ical material, which is merely comprehended under the aspect of pure form. The union of form and content, the totality, in which the form (itself empty and in need of supplementation) is joined to the content, is what Lask calls meaning. It is in every case the chief business of logic to separate from given com- plexes their sum of pure form, and so sunder the logical from the alogical. That this duality is found in the non-sensible, is shown by mysticism, which is a struggle toward the non-sensible, at the same time, however, toward the irrational. The categoric form of the non-sensible is validity, with which, in the sensible sphere, being corresponds. One must mention as a further merit of this work, that in the realm of the non-sensible, it makes a dis- 1 TUbingen, Mohr, pp. viii, 276.</page><page sequence="23">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN iou. 52I tinction between the valid, or in the wider signification of the term, the logical, and the metaphysical. If it is true that in the earlier philosophy there prevailed a one-sided tendency to hypos- tatize all non-sensible reality, for example, even logical values, a tendency whose highest expression is found in Platonism; it is also true that modern philosophy is threatened with lapsing into the opposite extreme, and of causing the metaphysical, super- sensible to evaporate in mere words and validities. In opposition to this, Lask rigorously maintains the distinction between the separate spheres, and in an universal interpretation of the doctrine of the categories, prepares the way for a logic of metaphysics. The increased interest which contemporary philosophy shows in Hegelianism, prompts me to call attention to its classical presentation by Kuno Fischer in the eighth volume of his Ge- schichte der neueren Philosophie.1 This exposition is all the more interesting because it follows closely the historical Hegel, and does not interpret him in the spirit of modern adaptations. Hegel's life and development are set forth in great detail. Hegel's relation to Goethe might be noticed here as of especial importance, because it shows that between these two men apparently so different in personality, there was no lack of intellectual inter- course. Both of them rejected the abstract logic of the analytical understanding and the mechanistic philosophy that rests upon that logic. Hegel emphasizes, in opposition to it, the claims of concrete reason, which restores to unity artificially isolated opposites; Goethe emphasizes rather the immediacy of intuition and empathy (Einfiihlung). Both of them, therefore, by different paths proceed toward the goal of synthesis. The difference between them is, in the last analysis, due to the fact that Goethe aims to construct the world after the artist's fashion; Hegel aims to com- prehend it in terms of concepts. The opposition to abstract analysis, expressed in Goethe's attack on the mathematical treat- ment of the doctrine of color, remains, after all, the common measure of the lives and philosphies of both men. Kuno Fischer's exposition is admirable because of its transparent form, especially in view of subject-matter so difficult and stubborn. 1 Heidelberg, Karl Winter's Universitdtsbuchhandlung, I9II, pp. I265, second edition.</page><page sequence="24">522 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. Even the involved ideas of the Phdnomenologie des Geistes and of the Logik, are placed here in high relief and become com- pletely intelligible to minds trained in different ways of thinking. In this connection one must mention an essay by Julius Eb- binghaus, published in the Kantstudien, entitled Benedetto Croce's Hegel. Ebbinghaus is an Hegelian of strict orthodoxy. He complains of Benedetto Croce that in his attempts at reform, he has revived the old dualism of the individual and the universal, the real and the notion, whose overthrow was Hegel's greatest work. There is nothing purely individual, nor is there anything purely conceptual. The application of dialectic to the indi. vidual and the empirical is, consequently, not merely permissible, but seems demanded by the innermost spirit of philosophy. And here we see that the separation of the rational from the irra- tional, which we found effective in the case of other thinkers, is rejected by the neo-Hegelians as a false abstraction, and for this separation there is substituted the doctrine of the persistent rational penetration of all reality. The controversy between the mechanistic and organic inter- pretations of nature is no less violent today than it was in the age of Schelling and Hegel. The solution of the problem of reality is still sought in terms of the organic. In Germany, Hans Driesch is endeavoring to establish this point of view epistemologically. His essay Die Kategorie Individualitdit, is written in the interests of this viewpoint and seeks by a sort of immanent criticism of Kant's doctrine of the Categories to amend them. Driesch thinks that the category of 'community' should be supplemented by the category of 'individuality' or be completely supplanted by it. The entire aim of the paper is to lay bare the weakness and one-sidedness of the mechanistic view of the world, which moves dogmatically within Newton's concepts and to substitute for it an organic view. For this turn of thought the works of other philosophers, to whom we must now call attention, offer important citations. The writings of two French philosophers, Boutroux and Bergson, which we have in German translations, must be especially mentioned here.</page><page sequence="25">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN iou. 523 Boutroux's works Uber den Begriff des Naturgesetzes' and Die Kontingenz der Naturgesetze2 contain an original exposition of the laws of nature from the standpoint of universal voluntarism. While earlier theories were satisfied with safeguarding the freedom of the human subject in a closed system of mechanism, Bergson aims to universalize the attribute of freedom and make it com- mensurate with the totality of being. The concept of freedom thus explained is, however, not at all identical with the con- tingent. The meaning assigned by Boutroux to the contingency of the laws of nature differs as much from the extreme of chaotic arbitrariness as it does from that of absolute necessity. To inter- pret the world in terms of absolute necessity would mean, in the last resort, to interpret it in terms of the proposition A = A. In addition to this analytical necessity there is, to be sure, a syn- thetic necessity, which finds expression in the principle of causality. Neither the one nor the other can be authenticated in the sphere of the real. The higher we ascend the scale of reality, the more the principle of unconditional necessity recedes into the background. This scale is characterized by the transi- tion from logical to mathematical, thence to mechanical, phys- ical, chemical, biological, psychological, and sociological uni- formity. These various forms of ordered being are not referable one to another, in the sense that the higher forms are deducible from the lower. Their interrelation is not due to the fact that the lower principle determines the higher, but, conversely, that the higher principle, in realizing itself, calls forth the conditions for its own realization. We have here the rejection of the mechanical interpretation of nature, whose leading motive is the reference of the highest power of being, viz., life and mind, to the comparatively simple scheme of mathematical quantitative rela- tions. Boutroux's principle of contingency is in many respects related to the principle of the irrational, which plays so large a rOle in modern German philosophy, especially in the determina- tion of the relation of the logical to the real. Bergson has further developed his doctrine of universal volun- 1 Jena, Diederichs, pp. 131. 2 Ibid., pp. vii, I66.</page><page sequence="26">524 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXI. tarism, especially in his work, Evolution creatrice and, at an earlier date, in another work, Zeit und Freiheit, which we have in German translation. He draws here lines of demarcation between cor- poreal and psychical being, which he attempts to fix more pre- cisely in his work Materie und Ged&amp;chtniss. The unique and interesting thing here is the analysis of time, which differs widely from all earlier discussions of the subject. Epistemolo- gists are accustomed to regard time as the analogue of space: they regard the sequence of phenomena as completely parallel with contiguity. Bergson protests against this parallelism. Time constitutes an entirely different manifold from that of space. The manifoldness of space is quantitative, numerically expres- sible. Number, in Bergson's philosophy, has its origin in a series of contiguous elements in an ideal space. The manifoldness of time is qualitative, most readily comparable with the manifold- ness exhibited by the tones of an overture. We do not count these tones, in so far as we enjoy their musical effect; their mean- ing is not exhausted by the fact that they constitute determinate members of a series. It consists rather in the peculiar inter- penetration and organization which they undergo. This essential nature of time is revealed to us in psychical life, which is purely temporal extension. The error here consists in regarding psy- chical life as spread out in imaginary space, in which separate elements are disposed like isolated things, clearly separated from one another. We are led into this error by the abstract analyt- ical understanding, which takes its points of orientation chiefly from space and the physical world, because it (the understanding) serves the practical aims of biological self-preservation. From this fact is explicable the tendency to fix modes of thought, once attained, and to transfer them to a realm like the physical, which, from its own nature, is alien to them. Bergson regards time as a fourth dimension of space, in which phenomena are not contigu- ous but sequent. He is fond of representing time as a line whose points, the separate moments, lie apart from one another. The investiture of psychical life with space has the effect of causing us to read into the hidden depths of consciousness that which characterizes only the upper sensible strata; it causes us to isolate</page><page sequence="27">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY IN ili. 525 from one another the several experiences in these depths as we do single perceptual objects; it causes us to shift the will to an imaginary space and thus to arrive at a false conception of the problem of freedom, an error common both to determinism and indeterminism. The freedom of the will consists in the fact that it is pure temporality; that is, like concrete time it is nothing fixed, self-repeating, but is rather a creative energy, which renews itself without cessation. The freedom of the will is that inner penetration of motives which we attain in constantly higher degree the farther we recede into ourselves, and the less the rigid separateness of space is taken as the form and standard of the psychical. In applying this conception of time to the characteri- zation of the world-process, Bergson arrives at his doctrine of creative development which, fundamentally in agreement with Boutroux, is a philosophy of voluntarism on the grand scale. This detailed account of the philosophical literature in Germany during the past year confirms my introductory observations. The synthesis between epistemology and metaphysics is still undiscovered. Thought continues its stubborn separation from Being. The study devoted to reality, because of its too imme- diate surrender to the subject-matter, threatens to neglect the indispensable means for the attainment of its end. The two chief opposing movements, now struggling for the hegemony, transcendentalism on the one hand, and pragmatism and intui- tionalism on the other hand, have been unable to discover any means of mutual adjustment and this is a sign of small cheer. Attempts are not lacking, as in Lask's neo-Hegelian Logik der Philosophic, but these attempts are characterized by intention rather than execution; they are inadequate to pave the way to a reconciliation of the opposing positions. This confusion in ulti- mate presuppositions is witnessed in the divergent interpretation and evaluation of the logical. For transcendentalism the logical is not merely a closed sphere; it is regarded as a power so sover- eign and self-adequate, that all reference to Being can be dis- pensed with. The world-concept is completely defined as the expression of a norm, a postulate, a value. For pragmatism the logical has a significance so subordinate that it is regarded merely</page><page sequence="28">526 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. as a variable function of determinate elements of reality, espe- cially of the will, whose concern is self-preservation, but prag- matism furnishes no very adequate justification for this way of thinking. For intuitioncl'ism the logical is subordinated under practical, voluntaristic points of view, as is the case with pragma- tism, with this difference, however, that the procedure of intui- tionalism is much more cautious and critical. For intuitionalism the logical is also biological, but just for this reason it is not the source of true knowledge, which is to be sought exclusively in intuition. There are corresponding variations in the concept of truth. The transcendentalist regards the logical, whose criteria are immanent, as unconditioned truth, without relating it to Being. The pragmatist also regards the logical as truth, but only in so far as it subserves biological ends, i. e., in so far as it is serviceable in the reality of life. Pragmatism recognizes no absolute notion of truth. The intuitionalist rejects the logical as the instrument of truth, because its purpose is biological; from premises similar or identical with those of pragmatism, intuitionalism arrives at opposite conclusions. Both systems share in common the effort to transcend the logical,-a metcalogical tendency, which on closer examination shows itself to be metaphysical. From this it would appear to be the problem of the philosophy of the future to get rid of rigid formalistic logic, to give it content, without di- minishing the independence or peculiar value of the logical. The fact that the metalogical and irrational can be treated and known only by logical and rational means, destroys its irrationality as little as it does its knowableness. The discovery of the profound point, in which the logical and the real are no longer two-fold but coincident, awaits, perhaps, the philosophy of the future. For the real task of systematic philosophy is to stretch the Hera- clitean bow, whose opposite tensions produce the harmony of Being and Thought. OSCAR EWALD. VIENNA.</page></plain_text>
