<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROGRESS IN EVOLUTION A thoughtful and interesting essay, by Mr. K. W. Monsarrat of Liverpool, has been published under the title Desire and Creation.'' This is an attempt to explain how it is that the process of evolution has always tended to be an advance from wrhat we recognize as the lower to what we recognize as the higher. Fortuitous and multitudinous variations, or sudden unexplained muta tions, through natural selection and other influences, may explain survival value in the struggle for life ; but what is it that has led to the production of higher and higher types of species as measured, not by power of mainten ance and reproduction, but by the qualities of life? The question has never been satisfactorily answered, or answered at all, from the scientific standpoint, and wre do not think that Mr. Monsarrat has succeeded where others have hitherto failed ; but his attempt is laudable and intriguing. The first point on which he insists?and the insistence is surely necessary to-day?is that every living being is a unity, a single entity, and that when we speak of body, mind, spirit, or of the various qualities and faculties of mind, we are dealing with the results of analysis merely and not with whole things. " The conception that a bit of man is ' material,' another bit ' physiological,' another ' psychical,' another ' spiritual,' is no longer tenable. If the unity of the living organism is a true fact, the only study which will ascertain the truth concerning its abilities is one that will propose to comprehend them all, attend to their relationships, and give an account of a whole." The author's next point is that in this study of the living being as a whole it is behaviour rather than structure which is of importance for understanding and explanation. " Ability of directing energy " is the mark of life in an organism, the unique characteristic of all the living ; such direction to satisfy desire is both self ward and other-ward, and the " desire to give," whether conscious or unconscious, is inherent in the constitution of all living things and is the essential element which has led to the progressive path that evolution has tended to take, and even, perhaps, in some sort, to the creation of life itself. As a philosophy this may serve ; as a 5 Desire and Creation. By K. YV. Monsarrat. Liverpool: H. Young and Sons, Ltd. 1932.

It clearly involves the Lamarckian hypothesis and the almost con stant inheritance of acquired behaviour and resulting characters. It is distinctly and avowedly anthropomorphic, working backwards from what is admittedly true of individual and communal human life to the ascription of similar qualities, even if in a more and more attenuated form, to the hedgehog, the oyster, the daisy, and the fern. In any case the way in which the author has formulated and expounded his propositions, and the many suggestive ideas which he has incidentally set out, make his essay worthy of careful attention.</page></plain_text>
