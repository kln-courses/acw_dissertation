<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM J. SCHAFER All Cod's Chillun Cot Wings (And Six Legs, Carapaces, Rube Accents) I. From Late Modern to Postmodern a lightning bug got in here the other night a regular hick from the real country he was - archy, "the flattered lightning bug" (Don Marquis) Over the past 25 years, Donald Harington has published a variety of works showing great breadth of interest, research, literary techniques, and formal dexterity, all in service of one tightly focused subject- the history, culture, and people of the Arkansas Ozarks. A student of art history and American culture, Harington has an admittedly obsessive interest in knowing- and retelling- everything about a region that might be defin- ed as "Appalachia West." There is a close kinship, everyone notes, between the Appalachian region (the first mountain barrier westward in North America) and the smaller but equally dense region of hills just across the Mississippl. To sustain his fiction Harington has invented a richly dense, nearly Faulknerian myth-saga defining his Platonic image of the Arkansas Ozarks and centered on a hamlet named Stay More, a family named Ingledew (plus exogamous relationships), and all the people, creatures, places, and things associated over a hundred and fifty years with them. Harington has been fecund in creating new formats and genres to encase his legend, and Bill Sch√§fer, chair of the Department of English at Berea College, is back at work after a year's sabbatical leave at the University of Durham in the north of England. And happy to be back! __ 276 spring 1990</page><page sequence="2">he has unraveled this massive investigation through five books of fiction and one work of memoir-travel-cultural-analysis-social-history (Let Us Build a City, 1986). His first novel, The Cherry Pit (New York: Random House, 1965), might be described as a pleasantly skillful late-modernist novel reflecting the cultural concerns of 1960s America. It charts a pilgrimage home for the young Arkansan Clifford Stone, the first-person narrator of this portrait- of-the-artist Bildungsroman. Stone, a healthy, active 28-year-old Southern good-old-boy, has gone North to Yale, studied American Civilization (shades of Tom Wolfe- both Tom Wolfes!), found a stuffy job in Boston as assis- tant curator for the Cabot Antiquities Foundation ("an organization devoted to the preservation of certain important relics, both tangible and intangi- ble, of the Vanished American Past, or VAP as we abbreviate it around the office"). Stone has married a stuffy college teacher, Pamela (he thinks her name is abbreviated "PMLA"), and has become bored with his routine existence. His alter ego Nub Stone (much low punning goes on throughout), his youthful Arkansan self, demands release from this frigid urban tomb, so Stone impulsively rides a train to Little Rock without his wife. Hereafter sexual and social adventures meet the returning hero, small- Southern-cityboy made good in the big cosmos of the Northeast. He locates his best friend, a stay-at-home policeman/roughneck, a childhood sweetheart (still a virgin or quasi-virgin but sexually adept), his widowed father, a black friend, and others cast up from his youth. The plot meanders in a Joycean way somewhere between the miniature portraits of Dubliners and Leopold Bloom's one-day Odyssey in Ulysses. Stone's ideas are interlard- ed with Dadaistic Latin tags, bits of preposterous scholastic argument, quotes from books and newspapers, and a dense record of the trivia of downtown Little Rock in the mid-'60s. The issue of black and white relations- civil rights, the "Negro question"- is interwoven with white middle-class reportage. In Little Rock, Clifford Stone receives an experiential education in American Civilization- the VAP- and in popular culture and Southernness- as-feeling. He has adventures- sexual, social, and anti-social- and learns to relive and relove his heritage on his native strand. Harington's prose is graceful, elaborate, rapid, often learned or mock-learned, effective in encapsulating Stone's WASP consciousness and semi-scholarly perceptions. The cherry pit of the title relates punningly to loss of virginity- sexual, spiritual, intellectual. It connects with love also and with the idea of a hard center (i.e., a nub-stone) beneath the soft, sweet, evanescent experiences of youth and self-discovery. The Cherry Pit is not quite so conventionalized as this capsule treat- appalj 277</page><page sequence="3">harington's bugs ment implies. It is spritely, idiosyncratic, and unusual in its focus on an out- of-the-way region and its down-home life. The details are admirably ex- act, as befits an "American Studies Novel"- and it brings to mind other excellent examples of the kind: Clancy SigaPs Going Away or Truman Capote's In Cold Blood or Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Harington's work takes a more idiosyncratic turn, however, when he connects himself to the Arkansas hills and the Stay More chronicles. His first installment, Lightning Bug (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1970; 1987), is a dense poetic observation of Arkansas hill culture in 1939, predominantly from the perspective of a young boy, "Dawny" (Donald- Harington?), in a romantic-nostalgic vein that raises odious comparisons with the hyper-lyrical James Agee of A Death in the Family, especially the operatic "Knoxville: Summer of 1919," which begins by describing how Agee (or his alter ego/narrator) 'lived disguised as a child" in that bite of history. Lightning Bug is radically dissociated in form, with various playful/esthetic postmodern devices dominating an obtrusively self-reflexive narrative. We are constantly reminded- a la Barth, Barthelme, and Bartleby the Scrivener- that we are reading a book, a printed-and-bound artifact that is removed from the "real" text of memory/experience Harington makes his subject. We are given "stage directions" for reading the text and made privy to the processes of writing the narrative. Like all such self-conscious postmodern works, the basic topic of the story is the construction of the story. The fragmented plot revolves around the earthy, sensual Latha Bourne, Stay More's postmistress, who is visited by her erstwhile lover, Every Dill, and acknowledges their illegitimate daughter Sonora. This revived romance is watched by Dawny who is thereby initiated into the dawn of sexuality. The book details courtship rituals, mating, a sexualized universe with Latha Bourne as its flickering axis. The Stay Morons (Harington's term) are representative pastoral archetypes from the Ozarks, including the Ingledews, the Ur-family in this mock-history. Harington steers us overtly to read the saga as comic history: IT BEGINS WITH THIS SETTING: the house of Latha, which is also the combined store-post office of Stay More, a community of 113 souls in the Ozark mountains of Newton county, south of the county seat, Jasper, and the lovely village of Par- thenon, west of the village of Spunkwater, north of Demijohn, Hunton and Swain, east of Sidehill and Eden. (p. 3) The "bug" of the title is Latha, who exudes sexual allure, radiates invita- tion, as a lightning bug flickers in the Ozark summer night. Her luminescence is the light by which innocent Dawny is educated to life and love. The next (and most complete) installment of the Ingledew/Stay More tale, The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975; 1987), is less fractured in structure: it is constructed as a mock-history-of-vernacular-architecture treatise, complete with Har- ington's illustrative drawings. This vehicle encloses a family chronicle of 278 spring 1990</page><page sequence="4">William j. schafer the Ingledews who founded and populated Stay More. The fanciful history is written soberly like a scholarly treatise, but the substance is pure, distill- ed Frontier Humor, replete with dull-witted backwoodsmen, vaudeville In- dians, grotesque diction in imaginary vernacular, mild scatology, wild ex- aggeration, etc. The device of objectifying character-types analogically as architectural forms is amusing and provides a sociological/anthropological spine to the long, dense tale of Stay More from its founding by Jacob and Noah In- gledew in 1 837 all the way to the immediate future. We travel from wicker- work Native American dwellings through log cabins, tree houses, clapboard shacks, carpenter gothic cottages to mobile homes and beyond. Each chapter pivots on a dwelling and on the Ingledews of the generation who built it. So we follow a rough chronology which is then besprinkled with digressive anecdotes and subsidiary episodes of the Ozark settlement. (Donald Harington claims as an ancestor Sir John Harington, the eccen- tric Elizabethan courtier-litterateur-inventor, and The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks bears more than a passing resemblance to Sir John's bizarre preShandean compendium-comedy, The History of Ajax [= a jakes], his tale of inventing the flush toilet!) The zenith of Donald Harington's literary experimentation with the Stay More saga occurs in his most recent work, The Cockroaches of Stay More (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1989). This novel converts the saga material to beast-fable format by telling a fantastic "parallel history" of the Ozarks through the roaches (and other bugs and animals) of the region. The story bows obligatorily to Franz Kafka, Don Marquis, and other cockroach-biographers, telling the history of Jack Dingletoon, a "rooster- roach" (no arthropod acknowledges "cock" as a decorous prefix) who is told his family name is a corruption of "Ingledew." Jack becomes obses- sed with genealogy (like Harington) and pursues his lineage. The story meanders through adventures, observations of human Stay Morons from insect points of view, and bits of cracker-barrel philosophizing as per the classic beast-fable pattern. The ambience seems to aim for the mystical whimsy of Russell Hoban's eccentric fables (The Mouse and His Child, Rid- dley Walker) or of a Disney epic like Bambi, but it is rather more like a Terry-Toon or other sentimentalized, anthropomorphic children's tale. It is less like archy &amp; mehitabel (and its prototype Krazy Kat) than like episodes from Snuffy Smith or UH Abner as dramatized by a flea circus. The experimentation of The Cockroaches of Stay More lies mostly with its playful language: The "translation" of terms from the human macro- world to the insect micro-world, the stretching of the human/cockroach analogy, the construction of insect "psychology" to reflect and refract the human minds in the background. This narrative zooms outside the pro- vince of the novel (or even the romance), as much as any postmodern anti-novel, as much as peculiarities like Donald Barthelme's The Dead Father, William H. Gass's Willie McMasters' Lonesome Wife, Robert Coover's The Public Burning, or (mother of us all!) Gertrude Stein's more gnarled and private narratives. If we seek the usual moral tag appended to beast fables, it might be something like ALL THAT GLISTERS IS NOT GOLD (&amp; A LIT- TLE WHIMSY GOES A HELL OF A LONG WAY!). appalj 279</page><page sequence="5">harington's bugs II. Languagelessr a Landfish ...i do not wish to injure your feelings but i weary of your ancestors... - archy, "a roach of the taverns" (Don Marquis) Though they incorporate an impressively wide range of ideas, facts, tid- bits of researched history and flashy literary/stylistic virtuosity, Donald Har- ington's fictions are dialect tales written for the ear- oral/aural artifacts. They depend heavily on dialogue, on the spoken narrative of Harington's characters. In The Cherry Pit, the speech is basically educated Southern colloquial. Harington has a good ear for lively dramatic speech, and when we turn from Clifford Stone's slightly prissy first-person narrative, the other characters carry their burdens of language gracefully and naturalistically. In the lengthy Stay More legend, Harington turns increasingly to Ozark dialect- or to an artificial version thereof that he has constructed. Two consequences follow: (1) the fiction seems increasingly a mannerist pastiche of nineteenth-century Frontier Humor, of the overblown, tediously digressive sort propagated by Petroleum V. Nasby or some other similarly hoary scrivener; (2) the broad caricature-lingo conjures up images from comic- strip hillbilly stereotypes- the shiftless, snuffling, shuffling, moonshine- brewing primitive with incest-twisted genes and a shirt-collar-sized IQ. To be charmed by Harington's Ozarkana, then, we must cooperate with a series of cliches and stereotypes which if applied as coarsely to African- Americans, Native Americans, women, the elderly, or the young would arouse serious megaton-range vituperation from Certain Quarters. But since Harington's targets are WASP males (women are rather con- sistently idealized as goddesses, nurturing mothers, and sexual priestesses), most readers will assent with the language and its implicit images. It is all good-natured kidding of the Middle-American Male, after all, tinged with a leaven of sentimentalism not too remote from a Norman Rockwell SatEvePost cover. Examples from Harington's rendering of Ozark dialogue are instructive: 1. "I don't keer what it takes. I will leave my wife and kids. I will sell everthing I own. I swear, they aint nuthin on this earth that I ever likes as much...." (Lightning Bug, p. 57) 2. "I aint gonna git to the other side nohow." (Architecture, p. 16) 3. "Best not let yore knowin of yore own name git ye inter lordliness." (Cockroaches, p. 5) These are virtually random samples that demonstrate a combination of Tin Ear, the Orthographic Fallacy, and Obsolete Frontier Humorism. Ring Lardner, arguably the most skilled and sensitive literary-dialect technician in American literature, late in his life set down cogent observa- tions on how written dialect "sounds." His are commonsensical and careful notes on the technique of "rendering" (i.e., suggesting) spoken regional American vernaculars without creating unsightly, cumbersome, and artificial 280 spring 1990</page><page sequence="6">William j. schafer idioms like those of Petroleum V. Nasby &amp; Co. (Mark Twain was perhaps equally skilled in reproducing all the real variants of the general Western/Frontier dialect.) Lardner observed that any spoken American English dialect pronounces "nothing" as something like Harington's "nuthin" (example number 1). Ditto for "git" (examples number 2-3) and "yore" (example number 3). The false "phoneticizing" of these standard pronunciations serves only one purpose- to create an illiterate spelling thus implying an illiterate mind. This ancient practice might be dignified as The Orthographic Fallacy. Tin Earr another dialectician's maladyr occurs in example number 1 with "keer"- a pronunciation from the vernacular that is unrenderable except by some cumbersome system like the International Phonetic Alphabet. It is probably somewhere between "ker" and "kyar" as heard, but this con- jures up minstrel-show pseudoNegro dialogue. In the same passage, "ever- thing" is quite goodr though the last syllable is probably closer to "thang." Obsolete Frontier Humorism flickers its forked tongue in all the "ye's" sprinkled about like nonpareils (example number 3) and in such oddities as "inter" for "into" (more probably "inta"). The effect is of awkward Br'er Rabbit cuteness or endless balloons snipped from Snuffy Smith and/or UH Abner. It tires the eye and the inner ear the way a brief tape loop from the soundtrack of The Beverly Hillbillies might be perceived- as slow tor- ture. It also is an offense against nature, out-heroding Herod. I pray your avoid it. This focus on language might be dismissed as grumpy nitpicking, but Harington puts ostentatious emphasis on language tricks and freight- bearing dialogue. His books positively flaunt conversations, long rhetorical debates, oral folklore, etc. We are meant to feel that these are real comic creatures Harington has invented, and generally the flow of his characters' speech forwards the stories. This may be precisely the problem: the lapses and discords obtrude from his polished linguistic texture, form blatant frac- tures in his esthetic. They make us feel he is lazy or careless in listening to the Muse, mishears common words and phrases. More important, they create a chasm of condescension in Harington's backwoods landscape. We are persistently reminded that the denizens of his Ozark pastoral are quaint, archaic, dim-witted, clumsily comical, self- blinded, uncouth, etc. While the surface of Harington's narrative praises these primitives for their stoical vitality, directness, essential honesty, in- nocence, and kindness, the subtext generated by Harington's insistence on spelled dialect reinforces a sense that we college-educated, Eastern- publisher-fed sophisticates have good reason to guffaw at such boneheaded proles. Lardner insisted that artistically effective dialect-rendering required a skillful, subtle development of cadence, syntax, phrasing, and rhythm. Masters of Southern fiction like William Faulkner, Reynolds Price, Cormac McCarthy, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, etc., have shown just how well ordinary, uneducated speech can be demonstrated on the page without stooping to slapdash, slapstick caricature. Sufficient comedy exists in the events of Harington's books and in the exuberant Joycean wordplay he often indulges himself in to keep us amused. appalj 281</page><page sequence="7">harington's bugs The language of his characters often works against his fecund comic im- agination, suggesting a poverty of observation- or at least of empathetic listening- in all his decades of intensive Ozark watching. III. Mountaineers Are Always Free i would put the temptation of greatness aside and remain an ordinary cockroach simple and obscure... - archy, "archy at the tomb of napoleon" (Don Marquis) How long a fall is it from debased Hobbesian mountaineer to lowly cockroach? It is a revealing image: if you imagine people as silly, insubstan- tial, and buglike, why not go the whole fantasy-image route and turn them into Kafkaesque bugs? (By the way, poor Gregor Samsa is a victim of popular misconception: Kafka does not specify a cockroach but an im- aginary/mythic generic "bug.") The process of degradation/retrogression is weirdly complete in Harington's fiction- from Latha Bourne as fertile female lightning bug to the literal-anthropomorphic roaches of Stay More. Harington clearly feels affection for his version of the Ozarks, as it ex- ists nostalgically in his imagination. After his extensive reading, research, and travel in the real mountains, the questions raised are to what degree does his whimsical fantasy correspond to any reality and to what degree is he simply perpetuating stereotypes from folklore and popular culture? His Ozarkans- "Stay Morons"- are lovable idiots, stock pastoral figures ("clowns")- the virtuous, unlearned shepherds whose "natural" wisdom and goodness compensate for their illiteracy and cultural poverty. For instance, Jacob Ingledew, cofounder of Stay More in The Architec- ture of the Arkansas Ozarks, through a series of comic accidents becomes a Civil War hero and ultimately governor of Arkansas. He like most of Har- ington's characters is a passive pawn of historical forces beyond his ken. He is like a lay figure from some over-reductive Marxist tract, urped up by a mysterious dialectical movement in history. Harington describes his people as shrewd or clever, but they act stupid and seem unable to com- prehend their collective fate. This brainless passivity climaxes in The Cockroaches of Stay More when the Ozarkans become groveling insects who worship the humans (Stay Morons, remember) as omnipotent divinities. They erect an elaborate theology/theodicy to explain why roaches are killed so randomly. The retrogression of the characters serves in the interests of a sentimental, Disneyesque cuteness- the children's-story fascination with "talking animals" and the "humanized" micro-world of insects, mice, etc. Yet the image is still one of vermin: the humans live in roach-ridden shacks, and the deified Man of the story is a melancholy drunkard who shoots roaches with a pistol (!) in a strained analogy for thermonuclear war or "overkill" and who manages in a stupor to shoot himself in the foot. 282 spring 1990</page><page sequence="8">William j. schafer On their surface, Harington's tales are optimistic and ameliorative- that is, things work out cheerfully for his characters, and the evils of their environment are overcome. But the implications of his stories seem to be that the Ozarkans will go on generation after generation as hapless sur- vivors of history's nastier accidents, victims (like the roaches) of incom- prehensible powers they can only worship and appease through the rituals of a quaintly superstitious culture. The roaches of Stay More manage with the help of their archenemy the Great White Mouse to summon help for their wounded deity, and the Man and Woman are reconciled. There is a running satire on religious fundamentalism and its blatant hypocrisies (a fat target these days!) and a kind of "religious philosophy" expressed about Sam ("Gregor Samsa"), a main point-of-view roach: ...Sam is about to become religious in the sense of believing that there is not one Man, or one Woman, but many of Them, and They have not perished from this earth, and never will, and if we continue to worship Them, and honor Them, and love Them, They have the power to keep all of us staying more, forever and ever, amen. Call this religion polytheism or myriotheism; call it secular humanism, even.... (Roaches, p. 326) Sam's conversion occurs on the edge of a toilet seat (as in "down the tubes") as the novel reaches its denouement. The imagery again is as debasing as the sentiments are uplifting. The version of "soft" primitivism Harington promulgates- that retrogressive, isolated, "primitive" cultures are also sweet, homey, nostalgically simple- differs from "hard" or Hobbesian primitivism which depicts such lives as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." Both visions are essentially outsiders' reckonings of complex realities. Both are judgmen- tal and reductionist. They always reveal more about the observer than the observed. Donald Harington is skilled as a fiction-writer- witty, imaginative, in- ventive, various. Yet his literary sensibility seems to fit too well Zooey Glass's basic definition of "sentimentality" in J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey. "lov- ing something more than God loves it." He has created and peopled an Ozark region of the mind which is full of his concepts of noble savagery and life-affirming earthiness. It is perhaps no more trustworthy or interesting than the overtly derogatory stereotyping that filled the pages of nineteenth- century local colorists' mountain romances or created the grotesqueries of the comic-strip, B-movie, TV-sitcom hillbilly farces, all that witless feudin', fussin', and a-fightinr. The ancient consensus about mountain tribes is that isolation, self- sufficiency, and traditionalism made them free of the fetters and vices of civilization. Even William Blake, a timid city-dweller somewhat spooked by raw nature, could declaim, "Great things happen when Men &amp; Moun- tains meet./ This is not done by Jostling in the Street." The romantic vision of the dour highlander, the stout mountaineer, created a heroic aloofness, a stoic hermeticism as the root quality for those living on the heights near the gods and clean clouds, above the petty squalor of flatland cities and tamed farmsteads. appalj 283</page><page sequence="9">harington's bugs The twentieth century seems only able to deal with this archaic freedom through pity and condescension: 'There must be something wrong with people who choose to live that way!" we exclaim. Or like Donald Har- ington, we can take a grip on such stubborn independence by reducing it in sizer making it tiny, comical, and tame, locating it in creatures that can be put into a laboratory and run through a maze. After having com- pressed their complex reality of mountain culture into a small, hard pill, a literary placebo, it is best to coat it with slick, easily digestible sugar. 284 spring 1990</page></plain_text>
