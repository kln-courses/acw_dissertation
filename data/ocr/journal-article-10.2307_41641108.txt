<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Twain's "Jumping Frog": Toward an American Heroic Ideal Lawrence R. Smith Eastern Michigan University Mark Twain's "Jumping Frog"1 has been at the center of a critical controversy in recent years. This controversy focuses on one major question. Is the story satiric, with Simon Wheeler as a deadpan trickster making fun of the narrator, or is it simply a wild yarn told by a mindless yokel? Interpretations and claims for the story have varied widely. Some have argued that the "Jumping Frog" is the summation of Twain's faith in frontier democracy, 2 while others have held that it is no more than an amusing story, told in an "exquisitely absurd" manner.3 A close examination of the structure and the component parts of the story itself, rather than argumentation in the abstract realms of cultural history and philosophy, indicates that the "Jumping Frog" is a great deal more than a yarn well told. Furthermore, it is more than a simple celebration of "vernacular" heroes and frontier democracy. Twain not only transcends the tradition of the Southwestern humorous frame story, from which the "Jumping Frog" is derived, he also passes beyond any narrow ideological statement. He has attempted to create a work that is broad and all-encompassing in its scope. In the encounter between the narrator and Simon Wheeler, Twain sets up a confrontation between the false and the true. As it happens, this is the classic confrontation between the "Whig gentlem√¢n" and the "vernacular" character. However, even this factor is not as vital to the meaning of the story as the larger conflict between the false and the true. It is Twain's main purpose to define and explore just what is true and valuable about Simon Wheeler and the qualities he represents. Relatively little time is spent in the deflation of the pretentious narrator; most of the story concerns Jim Smiley, his animals, and the stranger. It is here that Twain, through Simon Wheeler, creates an American heroic ideal. This ideal cannot be defined by such limiting terms as "vernacular," "frontier," "rural," or "western." The names of Smiley's two heroic animals, Andrew Jackson and Daniel Webster, reinforce the broadness and lack of regionality in Twain's vision. Yankee shrewdness and the East, conveyed by recalling the legendary Daniel Webster, 15</page><page sequence="2">MARK TWAIN JOURNAL are as much a part of the ideal Twain is defining as the frontier democracy represented by Andrew Jackson. Moreover, even the idealistic amalgam created by the Webster and Jackson images, and even the ideals represented by the optimistic gambler himself, are tempered by Smiley's deception at the hands of the stranger. What results from the whole tale is a syn- thesis of the best American traits: shrewdness, a spirit of enterprise and aspiration in Jim Smiley and his animals, and in the stranger the skeptical pragmatism necessary to keep the other characteristics within a useful and realistic framework. Simon Wheeler, as an American Homer, sings the praises of these heroes and the ideals they embody. Even if the narrator could never recognize these men or the traits for which they stand as heroic, Twain certainly does. The "Jumping Frog" could be described as the ultimate example of a genre of Southwestern humor, both in its complexity and in its sophistication. The tradition of a rural character duping and deflating the pretentious, smug city gentleman has been multiplied into an ingenious system of layers: a trick within a trick within a trick. Simon Wheeler tells the story of Jim Smiley, a trickster himself, being tricked by a stranger, and at the same time Wheeler makes a fool of the frame narrator. Twain is ripening the narrative "I" for his deflation from the moment the story begins. The "gentleman" obviously considers himself well- bred and eloquent, but such elaborate constructions as "In compliance with the request of a friend of mine" and "I hereunto append the result" characterize the man as a prig. His attempts at stylistic flourish are pretentious; he is the stereotyped "genteel traveller" which Twain ridiculed throughout his career. It is noteworthy that the false quality of the narrator's style is immediately connected with the clergy, when we find that he is looking for a Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley. The fact that he has an inflated self-image is further reinforced by the two stilted phrases associated with the mention of the clergyman: "a cherished com- panion of his boyhood" and "a young minister of the Gospel. "4 Twain could have easily contrasted the genteel and the vernacular simply by stressing the difference between the names, "Leonidas" and "Jim," but he chose to exaggerate the disparity by making the fictitious "Leonidas" a clergyman. Twain's lifelong association of the clergy, Protestant or Catholic, with the most foolish pretense and hypocrisy hardly needs comment. The narrator's attitude is also conveyed by his obvious condescension for Simon Wheeler, whom he describes as "good-natured," "garrulous," full of "winning gentleness and simplicity," "tranquil," "fat and bald-headed." In other words, Wheeler is depicted as the stereotyped yokel as seen through the eyes of polite urban society: homely, lazy, mindless, and most important, harmless good fun. However, even before the tale begins, Twain hints that this superior attitude may not be justified. Old Wheeler's influence soon renders the narrator a helpless captive: "he backed me into a corner and blocked me there with a chair." The old timer is far from tranquil and passive. His irresistible presence is reminiscent of Coleridge's ancient mariner's hold over the unwary wedding guest. The narrator further displays his lack of per- ception and his misapplied condescension in evaluating the yarn and Simon Wheeler's narrative manner. He calls the Jim Smiley story insignificant, "monstrous," "queer," and yet its implications, both for him and for American society as a whole, are monumental. He also finds the unemotional delivery of the old timer amusing, in fact, "exquisitely absurd." However, this only indicates that he has not recognized the traditional deadpan delivery of the rural character, and thus is properly ripe for being taken in. It should also be noticed that the narrator only thinks the manner of the telling "absurd," not the tale itself, and thus is unaware that Simon Wheeler is making fun of his ignorance of country life. The old miner's at- tribution of impossible characteristics to Daniel Webster the frog, and nevertheless convincing the narrator that they are normal, becomes his master- piece of satirical oneupmanship. Twain demonstrates Wheeler's awareness and his satirical nature at the beginning of the yarn. These qualities had to be established before the significance of the Jim Smiley story could be perceived. Simon Wheeler seems to fit the narrator's condescending characterization as he starts his tale with a digression, and continues with a long-winded list of examples of Jim Smiley's willingness to bet. However, he does not wait long before he launches his first barb. When we hear that Jim Smiley went to Parson Walker's "camp meetings" regularly in order to bet, we are puzzled. Does he bet on the length of the sermon, the number of conversions, or the number of furtive defections? Yet the ambiguity works well, because any interpretation is at the expense of Parson Walker and the clergy in general. It is only as Wheeler continues with the story of the straddlebug that we realize that Parson Walker has been included in a long list of animals, hierar- chically arranged by size and importance, with the good parson only slightly above the bugs. Smiley's bet that Mrs. Walker will not recover from her grave illness, after the Parson's pious platitudes "thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy" and "with the blessing of Prov'dence," only reinforces the mockery. At first glance this satiric jab at the clergy may seem gratuitous, but one has only to remember that the pretentious interloper, the narrator, is searching for a Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley. Furthermore, the narrator has been more than a little vain and pompous about his pious attitude toward the "young minister of the Gospel." The "simple" Simon Wheeler has already turned the tables on the man who had been so confident 16</page><page sequence="3">MARK TWAIN JOURNAL about his superiority. The old timer could hardly help being aware that jokes at the expense of the clergy, especially the sardonic joke about the death of the Parson's wife, would be highly unacceptable to the listener, who considers himself polite and well-bred. There should be no question as to whether this is Wheeler's humor or Twain's, because the mouthpiece for the author's satire is clearly aware of what he is doing. After putting the narrator in his place, 5 Simon Wheeler continues his narrative with the stories of three of Jim Smiley 's famous animals: the diseased mare, the bulldog pup, and the frog. All of these animals share one trait in common with their master: the ability to hustle suckers. Each one of his betting animals appears so unimposing, even to the extent of feigning disadvantage in a contest, that it is easy for Jim to run up a large bet before winning and sweeping the board. Like the unimposing Simon Wheeler, Jim and his animals prefer to look harmless, hiding their wit and power until the proper moment. They forego a desire for, or a trust in, show and appearance for the superior benefits of strategy. It is important for us to realize that this trait characterizes Simon Wheeler as well as all of those whom he praises as heroes. Fur- thermore, it characterizes an entire segment of American society, the part which is diametrically opposed to the false concerns and values which the narrator represents. The "fifteen-minute" asthmatic nag looks so bad that the bettors offer Jim an absurdly large handicap, and consequently his horse always wins with her final burst of spirit and effort. Andrew Jackson, the pup with talent and genius, can feign utter helplessness and take a beating until the bets are high enough, and then win easily by sheer tenacity. Unfortunately, he and Jim meet their match (a portent of the stranger's quail shot in the frog trick) when someone puts up a dog with no hind legs, thus removing Andrew's "pet holt." Nonetheless, the story of the dog, even in its heartbroken defeat, is heavy with significance for Simon Wheeler. Andrew proves that even the humble can have genius, and given op- portunity, anyone "can make a name for hisself." In other words, the dog is true to his name, an em- bodiment of the leveling ideals of Jacksonian democracy. Like the "enterprising vagabond" Jim Smiley, the bull pup finds his opportunity in the most mundane sources. This is a talent which his namesake, the legendary "Old Hickory," would certainly endorse. In an unpublished essay entitled "On Progress, Civilization, Monarchy, etc.", written by Twain a little over ten years after the "Jumping Frog," he openly praises the American ideal the bull pup sumbolizes : What I mean by Manhood ... is a condition where all roads to betterment are public high- ways, not free to one and forbidden to another; where equal capacities have an equal chance . . . where a man's origin counts nothing for him and nothing against him; where a man is not a god because he was born in a church, nor a corpse because he was born in a graveyard, but is just a man in both instances - no more, no less. 6 In this essay, Twain sees America as being far superior to the older, more traditional England. His vision of "Manhood" here points directly to the qualities for which Wheeler, Smiley, and his animals stand. Civilization is farther advanced by the values they represent than it is by all the pretensions to culture and refinement indicated by the narrator's stance. The dog's anthropomorphic attributes are amusing, but Jim Smiley's theory of education, ex- pounded in the story of Dan'l Webster the frog, is an even deeper exploration of this humorous vein. Here we are clearly in the realm of animal fable, where human characteristics are put into ironic perspective by applying them to common animals. However, Twain elaborates upon the tradition of the humorous animal fable by associating it with the tradition of the rural character's trick on the city gentleman. Twain applies human characteristics to Dan'l, but he multiplies the humor by also attributing the charac- teristics of other animals to the talented frog. Simon Wheeler's description of the frog could only be ac- ceptable to a man who had never seen one, or at least had not looked at one very carefully. Thus, the ridiculous attributions are directed precisely at the ignorance of the narrator. Wheeler says that Dan'l sits "modestly . . . scratching the side of his head with his hind foot" after an amazing feat of fly-catching. Anyone who has ever watched a frog knows that it, unlike a cat or dog, cannot scratch its head with its hind foot. Evidently, though, the narrator is not aware of the discrepancy. Later we hear that the frog is filled with shot "up to his chin," but chins are difficult to find on frogs. Still later Wheeler mentions that Jim Smiley picked up the frog "by the nap of his neck." In case the humor of this statement escapes the reader, it is im- mediately reinforced by Smiley's exclamatory "blame my cats." The association is inevitable; we see the ridiculous image of a frog being picked up like a cat. The primary thrust of all these misattributions is to "impose on" the credulity and ignorance of the citified narrator. However, the amusing attribution of human and other traits to the bulldog pup and the frog has another important function. By making the ideal qualities which Dan'l and Andrew represent amusing, Twain subtly undercuts them. Jim Smiley's very name suggests his unbounded optimism about the op- portunities of the common man in America. He and his animals represent shrewdness and self-reliance, but most of all they stand for the aspiration of the American. Using the humorous animal fable devices and the story about the stranger's trick, Twain warns 17</page><page sequence="4">MARK TWAIN JOURNAL his audience against being too sanguine about the validity of these ideals. If the animal representation of admirable American qualities undermines them by causing us to laugh, it remains for the stranger to give our faith in them at leaqst a temporary setback. Like other strangers in Twain's later works, such as the clever avenger in "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg" and Satan in The Mysterious Stranger, this stranger is a dispenser of reality therapy. The stranger in the "Jumping Frog" does not destroy the ideals which have been established before his appearance in the story, but he necessitates a r√©√©valuation, and perhaps a tempering of extravagant optimism. When the stranger asks Smiley what is in his box, the gambler replies with his usual device of understatement. Yet after implicitly comparing it to the exotic parrot and canary, Smiley clearly swells with pride as he an- nounces that the box contains a homegrown product, "only" a humble American frog. Jim Smiley's faith in Dan'l and all that he represents is so great that he lowers his guard and leaves the box with the stranger, a mistake one would hardly expect from a horseracing expert. The stranger is not blinded by any such pride or idealism; as a backwoods pragmatist he seizes the opportunity and fixes the outcome of the match. In order to increase Smiley's humiliation, the stranger emphasizes the significance of Dan'l's defeat: "Well, I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other forg." The apparently infinite room for expansion and aspiration for the common American man, or frog, has been abruptly limited. At the end of Simon Wheeler's tale, however, the victory is not at all one-sided. Even the narrator is able to perceive, in his introduction the yarn, that there are two heroes of "transcendant genius" in the "Jumping Frog" story: Jim Smiley as well as the stranger. Smiley is similar to his talented bulldog pup; he is glorious in defeat. Never for a moment do we expect that this temporary setback will shake his optimism or put an end to his enterprising spirit. Nevertheless, the incident with the stranger has challenged the American ideal of the shrewd, aspiring common man, which Twain has presented through an amalgam of the images of Daniel Webster and Andrew Jackson. This challenge is so powerful that we can no longer be complacent about the total validity of the ideal. It is only functional and worthwhile as an ideal if it is combined with a healthy portion of the skepticism, realistic outlook, and prgamatism of the stranger. The suynthesis, however, is not out of reach; the all- encompassing vision of the old miner indicates that. Simon Wheeler, as an American Homer, sings the praises of both Jim Smiley and the stranger in his illustration of a complex American heroic ideal. The synthesis is artistic; it is in Wheeler's clever narration that we see its culmination. In spite of the multileveled significance of the yarn, it is clear that the narrator has not benefited at all from listening to the old timer, nor has he begun to understand the significance of the yarn as a parable for himself and the rest of America. On the contrary, his pretentious facade, and the continuing disparity between reality and his perception of it, is just as great at the end of the story as it was at the beginning. His lack of change is demonstrated when the narrator tells us that the parting angry curse "Oh! hang Smiley and his afflicted cow!" is only a "good-natured" adieu./7 Far from under standing Simon Wheeler's depiction of the many faceted American ideal, the narrator has not even made the first step toward dropping his preten- sions of polite good-breeding and gentility. 1.

See especially "Two Ways of Viewing the World," the introductory chapter. 5. Even though the narrator is never aware that he is the target of Wheeler's satire, or indeed that there is any satire at all, he is clearly irritated by the old timer's lack of moral and artistic decorum. This serves just as well as an outright humiliation to put him at a disad- vantage. 6.

Press, 1961), p. 28. Salomon also includes a lengthy discussion of Twain's faith in America as the place where man could reach his ultimate perfection, and how this early belief was later modified. 7. This appears for the first time in the 1867 edition, as well as other comments of the narrator in his introduction to the tale. 18</page></plain_text>
