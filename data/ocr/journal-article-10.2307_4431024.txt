The main part of this book, the most recent study in the field of the so-called Homeric religion, consists of quotations from the direct speech in Iliad and Odyssey, in order to prove that the human actors of the epic poems really believed in the power of the epic gods (including da???? and ????a) to help or harm man. The evidence of the Linear ? tablets, which reveal an organized cult of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, etc., some cult-titles and other relevant material from post-Homeric times and, finally, the results of studies about important aspects of popular religion in modern Greece lead the author to the conclusion that the 'Homeric' religion forms part of a continuous religious tradition. I can recommend this book to the non-specialists; all the well- known problems about the divine machinery, the (moral) character of Zeus and the other gods, the relation between Zeus and ????a, etc., etc. are discussed, and the information is, generally spoken, reliable. For the specialist, however, this study is disappointing, because it scarcely brings new elements into the long discussion about Homeric religion : even the problems are sometimes not sharply defined. The following remarks may illustrate my judgment. 1. The continuity in Greek religion. Much more is known about popular religion in general and pre-Homeric and post-Homeric religion in particular than the Linear ? tablets and some notes in Pausanias ; I doubt whether a critical discussion of all the available material justifies the thesis that the belief in personal gods (or a personal God), who give(s) support and ???ea to man, throughout the centuries was the most characteristic feature of Greek religious experience; magic, the belief in fate and in other impersonal supernatural powers, the belief in gods who had no personal connection with their worshippers, have always been important. 2. The 'reality* of Homeric religion. Most scholars now agree with Ts. that "basic ingredients of the epic religion are relevant to religious concepts of ordinary Greek worshippers" (p. 143). The problem, however, is where popular religion ends and poetic invention begins. Of course, the poets did not invent Zeus, Poseidon, etc. But what about their anthropomorphic characters, the quarrels and fights they had with one another, the interventions of these great gods on the battlefield, the personifications like ????a, "?t?, etc. ? Ts. does not give us clear answers to these questions, and I think that most of these phenomena are the result of poetic fancy *).

Snell called attention to the fact that Homeric man had no unified concept of the 'soul', Dodds introduced the idea of "psychic intervention", Wilford speaks about projections of the "unconscious psyche" 2). The objection of Ts. against these theories is always the same: Homeric man really believed in the gods and their interventions. This is no valid argument: people in the 16th. and 17th. centuries really believed in witches; this fact does not make a psychological or sociological explanation of this curious phenomenon superfluous or suspect, it makes such an explanation necessary. Moreover, Ts.'s statement that Homeric psychology is only poetic (p. XI), is not in accordance with his ideas about Homeric religion. It is much more probable that both Homeric religion and Homeric psychology are somehow rooted in reality. 4. The daimon-concept in Homer. Ts. denies, as far as possible, the existence of vague, impersonal and general deities. He attacks the theory of among others Else and Dietrich, that theos and theoi stand for a general god or a general deity (pp. 58 and 78 ff. ) ; daimon and Moira, according to Ts., are old cult-goddesses (pp. 116, 122), although the arguments against this thesis have never been refuted3). Ts. starts his interpretation of daimon with ? 87 (da???s?? ???sas?a?) and ends with the conclusion that the Homeric daimon developed functions identical with those of personal gods (p. 116). As a general conclusion this is wrong. Only six times and only in the Iliad (A 222, G 420, ? 115, O 418, F 93 and perhaps ? 595) the daimon is identical with an Olympian deity and the best explanation I know has been given by KuUmann (Ts. does not mention his theory): it was an innovation of the poet of the Iliad to let the Olympians, and not the daimones of popular belief, intervene in human affairs, with the result that daimones and Olympian deities sometimes get identical functions; in the Odyssey, on the contrary, the daimon has again his old and original function (an impersonal and anonymous supernatural power, no cult-god, but an "Augen- blicksgott") and the interventions of the Olympians become less numerous4). ???te? de ?e?? ?at???s* ?????p?? (? 48) is the motto of this book, and I fully admit that this study contains much interpreta- tion in favour of the concept of natural religion, in my opinion more than the evidence permits.
