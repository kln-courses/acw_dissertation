Manf. / Volume 9, Issue 2 (May 2016) Table 1. Analyzed test conditions A set of finite element (FE) models, including the test buck, ATDs,  military gear configurations, and different seatbelts were developed  and integrated together. The test buck model was developed based on  the design CAD data. The geometries of the models for military gears (2) were based on the seated solider study ([7]) with simplification and  modification. The seatbelt models were developed based on the where Φ is the cumulative standard normal distribution, seatbelt component tests on the webbing, retractor, pre-tensioner, and  load limiter. A sequence of the crash tests were used to validate the FE models. (3) For each model, the ATD model was positioned and postured based  on the FaroArm data measured in the tests. The time histories of the  ATD head, chest, and pelvis accelerations, chest deflection, femur  forces, seatbelt forces, as well as the head and hip excursions were  used to tune the models, so that occupant kinematics and injury risks (4) can be accurately modeled. The parameters that were calibrated in the and models included the seatbelt slack, material properties of the vest and  other military gears, seatbelt to vest/gear contact, seatbelt routing,  friction, etc. For each design condition, injury measures, including the head injury (5) criterion (HIC), chest deflection (D), and left and right femur values  (LF, RF), were calculated based on the time histories of the ATD The last two injury risks are combined into output, and were used to compute the injury risks of the head, chest,  and lower extremities. The HIC is a measure of the likelihood of head  injury resulting from an impact, and is defined as (6) and the overall injury risk is calculated as (7) (1) It is important to emphasize that each crash test and each model run  where aH (t) is the head acceleration as a function of time, and t1 and produce an overall injury risk as in (7).
