<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Issues of Interpreting the Koran and Hadith  Patrick Sookhdeo ∗  Orthodox Classical Interpretation  Tafsir, the classical science of interpretation and explanation of the Koran, was con- solidated in the tenth century. Tafsir accepted the Koran as the word of God revealed  by divine inspiration (wahy) through Muhammad and divinely preserved. It is a mira- cle, inimitable and unique. As a divine theophany, each word is divine in and of itself,  and therefore worthy of every human effort of study and contemplation. Tafsir pro- ceeded through the scripture verse by verse and sometimes word by word. A symbolic  and allegorical form of interpretation (ta’wil) was also developed to explain the inner  and concealed meanings of the text. The Koran is the criterion by which everything  else is to be judged.  The Koran is accepted as the primary revealed source of Islam and of Islamic law  (sharia). Muhammad was believed to have been given the responsibility of interpreting  the Koran, so his words and acts—his sunnah, as found in the collected traditions  (hadith)—became the second revelatory source, expounding the Koran.  The five traditional sources for commentary on the Koran are:  1. The Koran itself. The Koran was accepted as the very word of God. It is authorita- tive when it explains itself. The Koran is free of contradiction, and apparent in- consistencies in its message are inevitably resolved through closer study of the  text.  2. Muhammad’s explanations. Muhammad was sent to explain and clarify the Ko- ran. The accounts of Muhammad’s teaching recorded in the hadith collections  contain much tafsir on the Koran.  3. The reports of the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad, who also interpreted and  taught the Koran. Where a Koranic explanation is absent, and there is no authentic  tradition from Muhammad, a consensus of the companions may be used in inter- preting a certain verse.  4. The reports of those who followed the companions, or the successors (tabi’un).  These individuals were taught by the companions, so their insight is next in line.  5. Reason. A qualified scholar’s personal reasoning, or ijtihad (deductive logic and  personal evaluation of arguments), is the final method of understanding the Ko- ran; it exists in conjunction with the other four.  In addition, there are five subjects of classical tafsir:                                                              ∗ Patrick Sookhdeo, Ph.D., D.D., FSyI, is the International Director of the Barnabas Fund and  the Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity, and is a Senior Visiting Fellow of the  U.K. Defense Academy.   57 </page> <page sequence="2"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  1. The text: ambiguity, variant readings, defective texts, and apparent contradictions  in the text of the Koran. It provided detailed background information and com- mentary on the text rather than analysis of its inner essence.  2. Legal rulings extracted from the text.  3. Determining which suras and verses were Meccan and which came from the  Medinan period.  4. Determining the causes of revelation (asbab al-nuzul) of the various passages.  This is important for analogical reasoning, as the contexts must be similar.  5. Specifying the abrogated and abrogating verses (nasikh and mansukh). The  principle is that chronologically later verses abrogate earlier verses that contradict  them. However, there is much discussion about which verses were abrogated, the  number varying according to different scholars. Some limit abrogation to verses  with legal injunctions only. Abrogation is valid not only when the Koran abro- gates the Koran; according to some scholars, the Koran can also abrogate sunnah,  sunnah can abrogate Koran, and sunnah can abrogate sunnah.  The variety of these discussions allow for a certain spectrum for divergent thought.  For instance, the verse, “Let there be no compulsion in religion” (Q 2:256) elicits six  different views in Tafsir al-Qurtubi (d. 1273):1  • This verse was abrogated by Muhammad himself when he forced the Arabs to  adopt Islam. The supporters of abrogation see verse 9:73 (“Prophet! Strive hard  [do jihad] against the unbelievers and the hypocrites”) as the abrogating verse.  • The verse is not abrogated. It refers to the people of the book who are not forced  to convert to Islam if they pay the jizya. However, idolaters are forced to convert.  • The verse’s specific context concerns the exiled Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir. The  tribe took with them adopted children of the Ansar. Those children who wanted  to leave with the Jews were allowed to do so.  • Another context of revelation cites two sons of a man of the Ansar who became  Christians. When the father complained about them to Muhammad, this verse  was revealed, and no one was sent after them to bring them back. However, later  the “no compulsion” verse was abrogated when Muhammad was ordered to fight  the people of the book.  • The verse means that those who submitted through the sword should not be  called “compelled” or “forced” (even though they were).  • Another context of revelation is that it concerns adult captives of the people of  the book who were not compelled to become Muslims. Their children, however,  were compelled. Magians too were compelled to adopt Islam.                                                              1 Tafsir al-Qurtubi, Classical Commentary on the Holy Koran, translated by Aisha Bewley,  vol. 1 (London: Dar al-Taqwa, 2003), 659–61.  5 8 </page> <page sequence="3"> WINTER 2006  Important commentators and exegetes producing books of tafsir were al-Tabari  (838-923), al-Maturidi (d. 983), al-Tha’labi (d. 1035), and al-Wahidi (1075). Later  pre-modern authors of tafsir works were al-Zamakhshari (d. 1144), al-Razi (d. 1209),  al-Baydawi (d. 1286), Ibn Kathir (d. 1373), al-Suyuti (d. 1505), al-Shawkani (d. 1839),  and al-Alusi (d. 1854).  The Koran was interpreted using several methods. The first of these was also the  most obvious: interpreting the Koran by the Koran. The most reliable commentary is  contained in the Koran itself. The ways in which certain verses clarify others is re- garded as the most significant form of commentary. The second method used of inter- preting the Koran in tafsir is interpreting the Koran by the sunnah—by the Prophet’s  interpretations of the Koran. His comments on the Koran (as well as all he said or did)  are recorded in the hadith collections. As mentioned above, the additional methods of  interpreting the Koran involved using the sayings of Muhammad’s knowledgeable  companions (sahaba) and their successors (tabi’un), as recorded in the hadith, and  using reason and ijtihad (tafsir bi’l ra’y).  The classical form of tafsir practiced by the exegetes mentioned above dealt with  three main areas: linguistic issues, juristic issues, and theological issues. Linguistic is- sues involve questions of vocabulary and syntax, meanings of words and phrases,  grammatical questions, issues of literal and non-literal meanings. These issues are most  often addressed through interpreting the Koran by studying the Arabic language and  classical poetry. As for juristic issues, the importance of law (sharia) meant that many  Koranic scholars were preoccupied with legal issues, such as defining the command- ment verses in the Koran. A distinction was made between the general and specific ap- plication of commandments. An important question was that of abrogation—the identi- fication of abrogated and abrogating verses. A fourfold division of the meanings of the  text was made into significative (‘ibara), implicative (ishara), analogical (dalala), and  assumptive (iqtida’). The final area of interpretation concerned theological issues. In  these analyses, the problem of anthropomorphism was discussed, as was the sinlessness  (‘isma) of the prophets and the problem of free will versus predestination; reconciling  the two extremes was a major preoccupation of the interpreters (mufassirun).  Classifications of Hadith  The various collections of hadith were crucial to the science of tafsir. While the hadith  collections as a whole were regarded as in some way inspired, individual hadith were  evaluated according to their reliability and classified as sound or unsound. The princi- pal criteria for classification were the perfection (or otherwise) of the chain of trans- mission; the freedom of the text from defect; and the acceptance of the text by the Sa- habah (in the case of Sunnis), the Tabi’un (their followers), and their disciples.  A number of classifications of hadith have been made. Four types of hadith can be  identified according to reference to a particular authority:  5 9 </page> <page sequence="4"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  • Qudsi (Divine): a revelation from Allah (SWT); relayed with the words of the  Prophet (PBUH).2  • Marfu’ (elevated): a narration from the Prophet (PBUH)—e.g., I heard the  Prophet (PBUH) saying...  • Mawquf (stopped): a narration from a companion—e.g., we were commanded  to...  • Maqtu’ (severed): a narration from a successor.  Six categories can be identified according to the links of Isnad—interrupted or un- interrupted:  • Musnad (supported): a hadith that is reported by a traditionalist, based on what  he learned from his teacher at a time of life suitable for learning; similarly, in  turn, for each teacher until the isnad reaches a well known companion, who in  turn reports from the Prophet (PBUH).  • Mutassil (continuous): a hadith with an uninterrupted isnad which goes back only  to a companion or successor.  • Mursal (hurried): if the link between the successor and the Prophet (PBUH) is  missing—e.g. when a successor says, “The Prophet said...”  • Munqati’ (broken): a hadith whose link anywhere before the successor—i.e.,  closer to the traditionalist recording the hadith—is missing.  • Mu’adal (perplexing): a hadith whose reporter omits two or more consecutive re- porters in the isnad.  • Mu’allaq (hanging): a hadith whose reporter omits the whole isnad and quotes  the Prophet (PBUH) directly—i.e., the link is missing at the beginning.  Five categories of hadith can be identified according to the number of reporters in- volved in each stage of Isnad:  • Mutawatir (consecutive): a hadith reported by such a large number of people that  they cannot be expected to agree upon a lie.  • Ahad (isolated): a hadith narrated by people whose number does not reach that of  the mutawatir.  It is further classified into:  • Mashhur (famous): a hadith reported by more than two reporters.  • Aziz (rare, strong): at any stage in the isnad, only two reporters are found to nar- rate the hadith.  • Gharib (strange): at some stage of the Isnad, only one reporter is found relating  it.                                                              2 Note: Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala, abbreviated SWT, is a phrase of respect said after pronouncing  the name of Allah. Muslims repeat the phrase “Peace be upon Him,” abbreviated PBUH, af- ter mentioning a Prophet’s name.  6 0 </page> <page sequence="5"> WINTER 2006  Two categories of hadith can be identified according to the nature of the text and  isnad:  • Munkar (denounced): a hadith reported by a weak narrator, and whose narration  goes against another authentic hadith.  • Mudraj (interpolated): an addition by a reporter to the text of the hadith being  narrated.  Four categories can be identified according to the reliability and memory of the re- porters. This provides the final verdict on a hadith:  • Sahih (sound): Imam Al-Shafi’i states that if a hadith is not mutawatir, to be ac- ceptable “each reporter should be trustworthy in his religion; he should be known  to be truthful in his narrating, to understand what he narrates, to know how a dif- ferent expression can alter the meaning, and to report the wording of the hadith  verbatim, not only its meaning.”  • Hasan (good): A hadith whose source is known and reporters are unambiguous.  • Da’if (weak): a hadith that fails to reach the status of hasan. Usually, the weak- ness is one of discontinuity in the isnad, in which case the hadith could be (ac- cording to the nature of the discontinuity) munqati’ (broken), mu’allaq (hang- ing), mu’dal (perplexing), or mursal (hurried); or it is one of the reporters having  a less than reputable character, perhaps because he told lies, made excessive  mistakes, opposed the narration of more reliable sources, was involved in inno- vation, or had an ambiguous character.  • Maudu’ (fabricated or forged): is a hadith whose text goes against the established  norms of the Prophet’s sayings, or its reporters include a liar. Fabricated hadith  are also recognized by external evidence related to a discrepancy found in the  dates or times of a particular incident.  Sharia and the Various Schools of Sharia  In many ways, Islam is sharia: the Islamic way of life, the framework of dos and don’ts  within which a Muslim leads his life. It is also a marker of identity separating Muslims  from non-Muslims. While sharia refers to God’s divine law as revealed in the sacred  texts, fiqh is the human (scholarly) understanding of the law, its elaboration and inter- pretation. It connotes human scholarly activity and the literature it produces. Practitio- ners of fiqh, the fuqaha’, try to discover and give expression to the sharia.3 Other legal  and scholastic experts—‘ulama, qadis, and muftis—also interpret and apply the law.  Legal issues are dealt with by looking at the relevant Koran and hadith texts filtered  through the long history of legal precedents and commentaries. The full implications of  sharia were worked out during the first two centuries of Islam. Scholars and jurists  created rules from the source texts through the device of “independent reasoning”                                                              3 John Esposito, ed., The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World, vol. 2 (New  York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 450–62.  6 1 </page> <page sequence="6"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  (ra’y) with the Sunnah serving as the interpretive framework to the Koran. Ra’y was  soon rejected by most and replaced by logical deduction (qiyas) and scholarly consen- sus (ijma’).  The various roots of Islamic law are called usul al-fiqh. Although sharia has  evolved over time, the primary sources of sharia are the Koran and hadith. These are  complemented when needed by a process of consensus (ijma’) and analogical reason- ing (qiyas).  Schools of Law. Four Sunni orthodox schools of law (madhahib, singular madhab),  named after their founders, developed and had been codified by the end of the tenth  century. The Shia developed a school of their own. The founders of the schools were:  • Abu Hanifa (700–67): the Hanafi madhab  • Malik ibn-Anas (715–95): the Maliki madhab  • Muhammad ibn-Idris al-Shafi’i (767–820): the Shafi’i madhab  • Ahmad ibn-Hanbal (780–855): the Hanbali madhab  • Ja’far al-Sadiq (700–765) (the sixth Shia Imam): the Ja’fari madhab, the Shia  Twelver school.  Other marginal schools that have survived include the Shia Zaydi (Fiver) school,  limited to Yemen, and the Shia Ismaili school. A small khariji-’Ibadi school has also  survived in Oman. Most Muslims until recently were expected to belong to one of  these schools, usually the one dominant in their region.  The founders of these various schools systematized the collections of hadith, di- viding them by subjects and interpreting their meanings as well as applying them to le- gal issues. The schools differ in some of the criteria they use for reaching legal deci- sions and in some interpretations of Koranic regulations and details of prescribed ritu- als, but they accept each other as orthodox.  Sharia tries to describe in detail all possible human acts, dividing them into two  general categories, permissible (halal) and prohibited (haram), and subdividing them  into various degrees of good or evil such as obligatory, recommended, neutral, objec- tionable, or forbidden. Sharia regulates in detail all matters of devotional life, ritual  purity, marriage and inheritance, criminal offenses, commerce, and the governing of  the Islamic state. It also regulates relations with non-Muslims within the Muslim state  as well as with enemies outside the state.  Islamic law is usually divided into two main parts. One deals with rituals (‘ibadat),  encompassing details on ritual purity, prayer, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, and sometimes  jihad. The second main part of sharia addresses social relations (mu’amallat), cover- ing criminal law; family law (marriage, divorce, inheritance); economic law (trade and  commerce, contracts); and several other topics.  The category of criminal law is subdivided into laws regarding the obligations of  humans towards each other (huquq al-insan) and laws governing human obligations  toward God (huquq Allah), which include specific severe penalties for a number of  crimes known as hudud (limits). Hudud punishments include the death penalty for  apostasy and adultery as well as the amputation of limbs for theft.  6 2 </page> <page sequence="7"> WINTER 2006  Sharia is interpreted and applied by Muslim legal and scholastic experts: ulama,  fuqaha, qadis, and muftis. Legal issues are handled by these experts by looking at the  relevant Koran and hadith texts filtered through the long history of legal precedents  and commentaries.  Areas of Major Differences Among the Sunni Schools. There are several areas of  significant difference between the main Sunni schools of sharia. The most important  concerns the interpretation of the Koran, especially which verses are to be regarded as  abrogated by later verses, and to what extent Koran and Sunnah abrogate each other.  There are also differences on the meaning and implications of certain Koranic words.  A second area of difference is around the acceptance and interpretation of hadith.  There is wide variety of opinion on the authenticity of various hadith, especially those  reported by a single narrator, and on their interpretation.  A third major area of disagreement deals with the status accorded to rationalist  doctrines in the various schools. There was much arguing between the schools on the  validity and scope of application of the methods of consensus (ijma’), analogy (qiyas),  reasoning (ra’y), and interpretation (ijtihad). There are additional areas of difference  on subsidiary matters that are too detailed to address here.  Characteristics of the Schools of Law  The Hanafi school accepts the four roots of law (Koran, Sunnah, qiyas, and ijma’). It  emphasizes the use of analogical deduction (qiyas), but also adds personal opinion  (ra’y) and the principle of selecting from several options the legal decision that would  most alleviate unnecessary hardship (istihsan). It is criticized by the other schools for  emphasizing speculative opinion at the cost of hadith. It generally shows more respect  for personal freedom and is more liberal than the other schools. It is also milder in its  treatment of non-Muslims and war captives. The most important manuals of the Hanafi  schools are the Zahir al-rawayah by Muhammad Hasan al-Shaybani, the Al-kafi (“The  Concise”) by al-Marwazi, and the Al-mabsut (“The Comprehensive”) by Shams al-Din  al-Sarakhsi. The Hedaya by Burhan al-Din ‘Ali al-Marghinani (d. 1196) is another fa- mous and authoritative textbook of Hanafi law.4  The Maliki school is more conservative in its emphasis on hadith, though it adds  the criterion of public interest (maslaha) to the four accepted roots of law as a basis for  its legal judgments. It also gives greater consideration to regional customs than do the  other schools. The major manual of the Maliki school is the Al-mudawwana (“The En- actment”) by Asad al-Furat, which was later edited and arranged by Sahnun as Al-mu- dawwana al-kubra. Another important work is Khalil ibn-Isahq’s Al-mukhtassar (“The  Concise Summary of Law”).                                                              4 Among the English translations of such manuals are: Al-Shafi’is Risala: Treatise on the  Foundations of Islamic Jurisprudence, translated with an introduction, notes, and appendices  by Majid Khadduri (Cambridge: The Islamic Texts Society, 1987); and Burhan al-Din ‘Ali  al-Marginani, The Hedaya: Commentary on the Islamic Laws, 2 volumes, translated by  Charles Hamilton (New Delhi: Kitab Bhavan, reprinted 1985).  6 3 </page> <page sequence="8"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  The Shafi’i school emphasizes qiyas and ijma’ and utilizes only the four roots of  law in arriving at legal decisions. It rejects istihsan and maslaha as forms of interfer- ence with sharia. The school is more selective in its recognition of hadith, which it  viewed as the only valid interpretation of the Koran. Al-Shafi’i propounded his teach- ing in the Risala (“The Message”) and the seven-volume Kitab al-umm (“The Book of  Essentials”). Important Shafi’i manuals are al-Nawawi’s book Minhaj-at-Talibin,  which is a standard work in Egypt, Malaysia, and Indonesia; and al-Suyuti’s Al-ashbah  wa’l-naza’ir.  The Hanbali school is the most literal and conservative of the schools, limiting the  use of analogy (qiyas) and human reasoning, demanding that all legal decisions be  based only on a literal interpretation of Koran and hadith and rejecting tools of adap- tation such as istihsan and maslaha. Hanbalis preferred weak hadith to strong analogy.  The works of the thirteenth-century scholar Taqi al-Din ibn-Taymiyya (d. 1327) are  extensively used by Hanbalis.  The Twelver Shia school has its own distinctive collection of hadith. While it ac- cepts Koran, sunnah, and ijma’, it rejects qiyas and replaces it with reason (‘aql) as the  fourth source of law. The sunnah is expanded to include the practice and sayings of the  twelve Shia Imams, accepted as infallible and inspired, having the status of divine  revelation. The disappearance of the last Imam in 874 was seen as an occultation  (ghayba.) He was believed to still exist in an invisible form, and will return in visible  form at the end of time as the messianic mahdi who will usher in a period of universal  peace and justice. In the meantime, the highest Shia jurists are his representatives, and  ijma’ means the consensus of these jurists, who also have the right of ongoing ijtihad.  An important Shia manual is Al-kafi fi ‘ilm al-din (“The Sufficient in the Knowledge of  Religion”) by Muhammad ibn-Ta’qub al-Kulayni. Other important manuals were writ- ten by ibn-Babawayh (Man la-yahdurhu al-faqih) and al-Tusi (Tahdhib al-ahkam and  al-istibsar). The most widely used manual among the Shia is Wasa’il al-shi’a by Hurr  al’Amili (d. 1699).5  Disciples continued the founders’ work, and over the centuries several widely ac- cepted manuals were composed by famous masters that laid down all that was needed  to be known about the law for all generations.  The development of the legal corpus in all schools depended on two principles:  First is the requirement that any formulation of the law at any time must be justifiable  by reference to revelation (Koran and hadith, i.e., Muhammad’s sunnah). Second, par- ticipants in each tradition must remain loyal to their own tradition, taking into account  the interpretive achievements of older masters. The law had to be justified by reference  to the continuity and the established identity of the school. Scholars were to find their  way back to the meaning of revelation only through tradition.  According to the traditional view, the canonical collections of Koran and hadith are  equal in authority, although the Koran is superior in its nature and origins. In practice,                                                              5 Andrew Rippin, Muslims: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, vol. 1: The Formative Pe- riod (London: Routledge, 1990), 103–16; Abdulaziz Sachedina, “Shi’i Schools of Law,” in  The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World, vol. 2, 463–64.   6 4 </page> <page sequence="9"> WINTER 2006  however, the hadith collections dominated the hermeneutical process. The relationship  between hadith and Koran was controversial. Some early jurists claimed that the sun- nah might abrogate the Koran; others, that the sunnah passed judgment on the Koran;  and yet others that it clarified and explained the Koran. All agreed with the statement  that, “the Book is in greater need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah is of the Book” (al- Awza’i, d. 774).6  Closing the Gates of Ijtihad and Taqlid. The founders of the five schools of Islamic  law lived in the eighth century and the first half of the ninth century. From the tenth  century onwards, scholars of the various school of law gradually reached a consensus  that all essential questions of law had been comprehensively discussed and settled by  the great founding scholars. By the end of the tenth century, efforts to find new inter- pretations of sharia came to an end. Later scholars were not deemed to have the neces- sary qualifications for independent reasoning, so all future activity had to be confined  to the explanation, application, and interpretation of doctrines that had already been  established. This “closing the door of ijtihad ” opened the way for the practice of  taqlid, the imitation of the great scholars and pious masters, which meant the unques- tioning acceptance of the decisions of the established schools and authorities.7 Devia- tion from past jurists’ opinions was disapproved of and considered sinful. Since that  time, the sharia was seen as a set of static and unchanging norms, a comprehensive  code from which there can be no variation. This development created a great reluc- tance among the majority of Sunni Muslims to indulge in ijtihad.  Mernissi sees the closing of the gates of ijtihad as part of the process of closing Is- lamic orthodoxy to the possibilities of freedom of thought under the “terror of the  sword.” Political rulers (caliphs) and the religious establishment stifled debate, and in- tellectual opposition was repressed. Dissidence henceforth was expressed by violent  rebellions against totalitarian leaders, killing them and replacing them with other to- talitarian leaders, not by questioning and changing the political system.8  The Mu’tazila Interlude—Reason as Key. The Mu’tazila were a rationalist school  of theology who were dominant in the Abbasid Empire in the ninth century. The  Mu’tazila used dialectic, logic, and rational argument to develop their system.  Mu’tazila thought led to a remarkable flourishing of Islamic science and culture, and to  a relaxation in relations between Muslims and non-Muslims. Their main ideas were:  • Reason is a means of knowing God  • God’s justice is God binding himself to act in accordance with his essential at- tributes                                                              6 Esposito, ed., The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World, vol. 2, 450.  7 J.

The Ash’arites—Without Reason. However, opposing views to those of the  Mu’tazila gained the upper hand and finally formed what we now think of as orthodox  Sunni Islamic theology. The suppression of Mu’tazila thought led inexorably to closing  the gates of ijtihad when all further development of sharia was banned. The victorious  party was the Ash’arites, who taught that:9  • Man cannot know God or understand Him by his reason, but must simply obey  and accept God’s inscrutable and arbitrary omnipotence and will.  • Divine predestination overrules man’s free will, and omnipotent power is God’s  main attribute.  • There is no link between cause and effect, as God in every moment creates all  things anew according to his will. Creation is thus unpredictable, and there is no  need to study natural laws or to seek causes of perceived effects. God is not ac- countable even to his own self and norms.  • The Koran is uncreated and has existed with God from eternity, and as such is  more an object of worship and of unquestioned obedience than of reasoned inter- pretations.  The Ash’arite victory over the Mu’tazila profoundly influenced the development of  Islam. First, a totalitarian view of God and of His will for the world developed. Believ- ers were expected to practice strict obedience to sharia and its injunctions, including  jihad and the treatment of non-Muslims, which encouraged totalitarian forms of gov- ernment. Second, the Islamic ruler (whether Sunni caliph or Shia imam), as God’s  vice-regent and delegate on earth, acts as God does: his will is to be unquestioningly  obeyed, he is accountable to no human agency, only to God. Third, a fatalistic Islamic  world-view developed in which the will to power remains the only absolute, because  that is what God is. The believer surrenders unconditionally to God’s will, including its  manifestation in a tyrannical political system. Finally, a system based on unreasonable  pure will to power inevitably leads to violence to solve all problems.10 Will must be  imposed by force, as reason has no place in the system.                                                              9 Followers of Abul Hasan ‘Ali ibn Isma’il al-Ash’ari (873–935), who repudiated his  mu’tazila beliefs, became a Hanbali Sunni, and established the Ash’arite theology, which be- came the orthodox Sunni doctrine and has dominated Sunni Islam since the tenth century.  10 Fatima Mernissi refers to Nietzcshe’s idea of the “will to power” as the most basic driving  force in the universe and in human society, an idea picked up by Fascist and Nazi ideologues  and borrowed from them by contemporary Islamists.  6 6 </page> <page sequence="11"> WINTER 2006  Classical Attitudes to and Interpretations of Jihad  Classical scholarly interpretations of violence in Islamic theology are derived from the  Koran, hadith, and sharia, as well as from the normative example of Muhammad and  the experiences of violent conflicts in the early history of Islam. These factors provided  the theoretical framework and paradigms within which jihad and the means it may em- ploy are discussed, interpreted, legitimated, and implemented.  Most traditional Muslim scholars asserted that all “peaceful” verses in the Koran  were abrogated by the so-called “Sword Verse” (Q 9:5), which commands Muslims to  fight anyone who refuses to convert to Islam. It is clear from the hadith that Muham- mad and the first Muslims understood the term jihad to include physical warfare and  literal killing. In the hadith collections, especially those of Bukhari and Muslim, mili- tary jihad takes up almost all the space of the chapters devoted to jihad. Muhammad’s  military expeditions (ghazawat) are treated as forms of jihad, and Muhammad’s com- panions are seen as being very much concerned with the offensive military activities of  the Muslim community.11  Sharia clearly establishes jihad as one of the most basic religious duties. There is  little difference between Sunni and Shia law concerning war. Linked to the concept of  jihad is the division of the world into two domains: the House of Islam (Dar al-Islam)  and the House of War (Dar al-Harb). Muslims are supposed to wage jihad to change  the House of War (areas where non-Muslims are politically dominant) into the House  of Islam, regions politically dominated by Muslims.  Some Classical and Medieval Scholars on Jihad  Shaybani (750–804), Siyar. Siyar is the branch of Islamic law concerned with interna- tional relations. The early Muslim jurists used to deal with siyar under the general  heading of jihad. For Shaybani, the sword was a marker of the God-given Islamic gov- ernment, given to deal with all possible forms of unbelief: polytheism, apostasy, Peo- ple of the Book, and Muslim dissenters from Islamic orthodoxy:  Allah gave the Prophet Muhammad four swords [for fighting unbelievers]: the first  against the polytheists, which Muhammad himself fought with; the second against  apostates, which Caliph Abu Bakr fought with; the third against the People of the  Book, which Caliph ‘Umar fought with; the fourth against dissenters which Caliph  ‘Ali fought with.12  Abu’l-Hasan al-Mawardi (972–1058), Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya. Al-Mawardi  stressed both earthly and heavenly rewards as legitimate motivation for jihad warriors.  He defined the enemy in a jihad as those who refuse to convert to Islam. Jihad must be  fought constantly, at least once a year.                                                              11 Egdunas Racius, The Multiple Nature of The Islamic Da’wa, Doctoral Dissertation, The Fac- ulty of Arts, University of Helsinki (Helsinki: Valopaino Oy, 2004), 51.  12 Shaybani, Kitab al-Siyar al-Kabir, I, 14-5, quoted in Majid Khadduri, War and Peace in the  Law of Islam (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1955), 74.  6 7 </page> <page sequence="12"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  Ibn Rushd (Averroes, d. 1198), Bidayat al-Mujtahid wa Nihayat al-Muqtasid.13  According to Ibn Rushd, there is a scholarly consensus that all polytheists (mushrikun)  are to be fought and that it is permissible to enslave them—men, women, and children.  Only monks are exempt from being enslaved, revealing that People of the Book are in- cluded in his definition of polytheists. There is also a consensus that it is permissible in  war to kill all adult male polytheist fighters, but once taken as prisoners there is some  argument as to whether they may be executed and in what circumstances.14  Ibn Taymiyya (1263–1328). According to Ibn Taymiyya, the aim of jihad is to  make Islam dominant in the world, and all those who oppose this purpose must be  fought: “Since lawful warfare is essentially jihad, and since its aim is that the religion  is God’s entirely and God’s word is uppermost, therefore according to all Muslims,  those who stand in the way of this aim must be fought.”15 God has provided both Koran  and sword to win the world to his religion, Islam: “There are two things which can es- tablish and sustain religion: the Koran and the sword.”16  He advocated a permanent struggle between Islam and non-Muslims. Wherever  Muslims are a weak minority, they must endeavor by all possible means to become  powerful and dominate the non-Muslims.17 Ibn Taymiyya exalted military jihad as the  best religious act a man can perform, better than pilgrimage, prayer, or fasting. Jihad  implies “all kinds of worship, both in its inner and outer forms. More than any other act  it implies love and devotion for God.”18  Ibn Naqib al-Misri (d.1368), ‘Umdat al-Salik (“Reliance of the Traveler”). This is  an important Shafi’i text. According to Ibn-Naqib al-Misri, an Egyptian Hanafi jurist,  jihad is fought against Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and all other people—basically  against all non-Muslims: “The caliph makes war upon Jews, Christians, and Zoroastri- ans until they become Muslims or else pay the non-Muslim poll tax.... The caliph  fights all other peoples until they become Muslim.”19  Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), The Muqaddima. The North African philosopher-histo- rian Ibn Khaldun defined jihad as “a religious duty, because of the universalism of the  [Muslim] mission and [the obligation to] convert everybody to Islam either by persua- sion or force.”20                                                              13 Ibn Rushd, The Distinguished Jurist’s Primer (Bidayat al-Mujtahid), translated by Imran  Ahsan Khan Nyazee, vol. 1 (Reading: Garnet Publishing, 1994), 454–87.  14 Ibid., 455–57.  15 Ibn Taymiyya, translated in Rudolph Peters, Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader  (Princeton, NJ: Markus Wiener, 1996), 49.  16 Ibn Taymiyya, al-Siyasa, quoted in Qamaruddin Khan, The Political Thought of Ibn Taymi- yah (Delhi: Adam Publishers, 1982), 37.  17 Qamaruddin Khan, The Political Thought of Ibn Taymiyah, 37–38.  18 Ibn Taymiyya, translated in Peters, Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam, 47–48.  19 Ahmad Ibn Naqib al-Misri, Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Sacred Islamic  Law (‘Umdat al-Salik), edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, rev. ed.

Sirhindi argued forcibly against any accom- modation with Hinduism, as Hindus were kafirs. He sought to revive the earlier jihadi  spirit of the Islamic state, arguing that “Shariat can be fostered through the sword”:21  Kufr and Islam are opposed to each other. The progress of one is possible only at the  expense of the other and co-existence between these two contradictory faiths is un- thinkable. The honor of Islam lies in insulting kufr and kafirs. One who respects  kafirs, dishonors the Muslims. ... They should be kept at an arms’ length like  dogs.... The real purpose in levying jizya on them [the non-Muslims] is to humiliate  them to such an extent that, on account of fear of jizya, they may not be able to dress  well and to live in grandeur. They should constantly remain terrified and trembling. It  is intended to hold them under contempt and to uphold the honor and might of Is- lam.22  Shah Wali Allah of Delhi (1702–62). According to Shah Wali, jihad—fighting in  God’s way—is the perfect implementation of sharia. Leaders of non-Muslim commu- nities who refuse to accept Islam must be killed, and their followers forcibly converted  to Islam.23  It has become clear in my mind that the kingdom of heaven has predestined that  kafirs should be reduced to a state of humiliation and treated with utter contempt.  Should that repository of majesty and dauntless courage [Nizam al-Maluk] gird his  loins and direct his attention to such a task he can conquer the world. Thus the faith  will become more popular and his own power strengthened; a little effort will be  profoundly rewarded. ... You should therefore not be negligent in fighting jihad. ...  Oh Kings! Mala a’la urges you to draw swords and not put them back in their  sheaths again until Allah has separated Muslims from the polytheists and the rebel- lious kafirs and the sinners are made absolutely feeble and helpless. ... We beseech  you [Durrani] in the name of the Prophet to fight a jihad against the infidels of this  region. This would entitle you to great rewards before God the Most High and your  name would be included in the list of those who fought jihad for His sake. As far as  worldly gains are concerned, incalculable booty would fall into the hands of the Is- lamic ghazis and the Muslims would be liberated from their bonds. ... Jihad should  be their first priority, thereby ensuring the security of every Muslim.24                                                              21 Sayyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Muslim Revivalist Movements in Northern India in the Sixteenth  and Seventeenth Centuries (New Delhi: Agra University Press, 1965), 247.   22 Ibid., 248–49.  23 Sayyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Wali-Allah and His Times (Canberra: Ma’rifat Publishing  House, 1980), 294–96, 299, 301, 305, quoted in Andrew G.

These efforts can be divided  between those that would pursue modernization and liberalization to keep Islam in step  with other contemporary civilizations, and those that would create a stricter, more pu- ritanical faith completely unblemished by any outside influence.  Modern interpretation or the Koran and hadith is based on three interrelated princi- ples:25  • Use of scientific reason and methodology to interpret the Koran, or use of the  Koran itself and rejection of extraneous material found in hadith and earlier  commentaries  • Divesting the Koran of presumed legendary traits, fantastic stories, magic, fables,  and superstitions, and focusing instead on symbolic interpretation  • Rationalizing Islamic doctrine by basing it solely or mainly on the Koran.  Some of the key characteristics of modern interpretation include:  • An emphasis on the spiritual content of the Koran  • Diminished interest in grammar, rhetoric, and theology  • Greater emphasis on modern problems in economic, social, moral, and political  spheres that affect Muslims  • Use of tafsir as a vehicle to advance ideas in these spheres, for reform and revival  • The assumption that Koranic suras are unities with significant order and coher- ence  • Emphasis on efforts to demonstrate the harmony between science and Islam  • Rejection of taqlid and the reopening of the gates of ijtihad in order to achieve  their goals. Ijtihad is seen as the God-given method for social and political  change, and is held to be an essential element in Islamic thought to ensure Islam’s  vitality. The “closing of the gates” was a serious mistake, which led to the decay  of Muslim civilization.26  Many Muslim reformers have seen the return to the sources of Islam (Koran and  sunnah), the downgrading of the authority of the four legal schools (madhahib), and  the discarding of later traditions as the “golden key” that would cure Muslim societies  of their backward state and political weakness vis-à-vis the West. This approach en- abled scholars to select and mix from the different compendiums at will and borrow the  best elements from Western cultures, setting up the good of the community (maslaha)                                                              25 Andrew Rippin, Muslims: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, vol. 2: The Contemporary  Period (London: Routledge, 1993), 86–97.  26 Muqtedar Khan, “Who are the ‘moderate’ Muslims?” Islam for Today website.

The reformers also rejected common law (‘adat,  ‘urf) and popular Sufi practices.27 Most reformers also stressed the importance of rea- son and differentiated between a core set of sharia that was unchangeable and eternal  (either the part that deals with duties to God, ’ibadat, or a core of universal values),  and the larger part dealing with social relations in society, which was open to change  and to adaptations to new contexts.28 Many also rejected the doctrine of abrogation, re- placing it by harmonizing the various contradictory Koranic passages in the light of the  text’s eternal universal core values.  Koranic commentaries, tafsir, have become a vehicle for the spread of new ideas in  the Muslim world. A variety of concepts are made relevant to contemporary Muslims  by trying to base them in the Koranic text. A wide variety of views on what constitutes  true Islam has developed, including modernist, modernist with a universalist emphasis,  radical Islamist with literary and scientific emphases, as well as neo-traditionalist with  a philological emphasis. All compete for dominance in the wider Muslim world of  today. Two main issues arise, however, in all of these views: the miraculous nature of  the Koran and its rationality; and the difference between moral and legal obligations.29  Early Reform  Sayyid Ahmed Khan in India (1817–98).30 Sayyid Ahmad Khan was the first modern  reformer to make a substantial impact on the Muslim world. He founded the Muham- madan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, India, with the aim of producing an edu- cated elite of Muslims able to compete successfully with Hindus for jobs in the colo- nial Indian administration. He believed that the only hope for Islam in the colonial  world lay in modernizing Muslim institutions. Khan wrote the first modernist com- mentary on the Koran, the Tafsir al-Koran. The following points provide an overview  of Khan’s approach:  • The Koran, properly understood and reinterpreted by reason, would supply a  guide to Islam’s accommodation to Western influence and the modern world, and  reconcile the contradictions between traditional Islam and modern science.31  • Sunnah should be modified by weakening the hold of ijma’ and renewing the  right of ijtihad.  • A fundamental distinction must be made between details of revelation (furu’) and  the general principles underlying them (‘usul).                                                              27 Olivier Roy, The Failure of Political Islam, trans.

Traditional sharia reflects the  ideas and practices of the first generation of Muslims.  • All laws are subject to change according to circumstances; only the ‘ibadat  (regulations governing worship and religious rituals) were perfect and immutable.  In addition to these key elements of his thought, Khan challenged orthodox inter- pretation on several additional points. He questioned the sunnah as the infallible  source of law and criticized the methodology of the early hadith collectors, including  Bukhari and Muslim, in terms similar to those put forth by the Western scholars,  Goldziher and Schacht. Khan also advocated the free choice of rulings from all schools  of law, instead of requiring adherence to a single school. Finally, he tried to harmonize  Islamic rules with Western norms, arguing that Islam condemned slavery and that jihad  was only defensive in nature.  Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) and Egyptian Reform. ‘Abduh, the grand mufti of  Egypt, wrote a commentary, Tafsir al-Manar, which is marked by a rationalist spirit  and provides moral direction for Muslims in the modern world. He urged a return to  the sources of Koran and sunnah as the ultimate authority, thus denigrating the impor- tance of the traditional legal schools. He used modern knowledge and human reason to  interpret the Koran, saying that everything needed is found in the Koran and arguing  that the aim of the text is to provide moral principles applicable to all times.32 In addi- tion, he rejected rigid scholasticism and taqlid, and distinguished between the un- changing core of Islam and its external manifestations, which were open to change. He  asserted that there was no conflict between Islam and modernity. Revelation and rea- son were not contradictory, but complemented each other as the two sources of Islam.  ‘Abduh used Mu’tazili rationalism and revived the earlier genre of reason-based  exegesis (tafsir bi’l-ra’y), which had lain dormant for centuries. He hoped to reform  Islam and sharia by discovering the real intent of its unchanging fundamental princi- ples, as well as by selectively appropriating aspects of Western culture and practice  that are not contrary to Islam. He recognized that regulations of worship (‘ibadat) were  unchangeable, but asserted that precepts on social affairs (mu’ammalat) were open to  re-interpretation and change, with the aim of promoting the welfare of society.  He followed the Maliki principle of seeking to serve maslaha (public interest) in  his legal rulings (fatwas), allowing the law to be changed according to modern re- quirements. ‘Abduh also used the principle of talfiq (piecing together), whereby rulings  were developed by systematically comparing the views of the four madhabs and se- lecting the ones most consonant with maslaha and with the universal principles of Is- lam.33 He believed that Islam should attempt to control change via decisions that would  be based on Islamic criteria for selecting what is good for modern life. He fought  against traditional tafsir, arguing for the need to make Koranic commentary accessible                                                              32 Rippin, Muslims: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, vol. 2, 88–89.  33 John J.

This new commentary must be relevant to modern needs, rejecting  theological speculations and detailed grammatical discussions.  Fazlur Rahman (1919–88). Rahman directed the Islamic Research Institute in Paki- stan until conservative elements pressured him to leave. His book, Major Themes of  the Koran, uses his method of interpreting the text not literally but by looking for the  moral intention behind it. In order to interpret the Koran meaningfully for modern  times, he believed a double movement of thought is needed. First, scholars must be  able to think back and compare present situations to Koranic times. This requires an  understanding the meaning of the Koran as a whole, as well as its specific tenets that  are responses to the specific contextual situation of its time. Second, scholars must be  able to project from Koranic times to the present, generalizing specific answers as uni- versal and applying them to present realities and contexts.  Rahman also differentiated between legal and moral regulations, saying that legal  rulings are binding primarily in their moral sense, not in their literal wording. In addi- tion, he believed that much of classical Islamic commentary and law was wrong be- cause the jurists had ignored the moral imperative behind the text, viewing the text as  containing unchangeable, literal legal enactments. Muslims have failed to understand  the true meaning of the Koran because of the traditional methods that have been used  in interpreting it, which led to the creation of the traditional sciences of the Koran and  the legal framework of sharia, and the rejection of Islamic philosophy. Buried under  the debris of grammar and rhetoric and the many commentaries on commentaries on  Koran and hadith written by scholars of the past, the Koran lost its vibrancy and revo- lutionary import. Finally, he believed that Muslims could free themselves from the  burden of the past by studying history critically and differentiating the essentials of the  faith from all unnecessary additions.34  Radical Reform: Mahmud Muhammad Taha in Sudan 35   The Sudanese scholar and religious leader Dr. Mahmud Muhammad Taha made a  sharp distinction between the Meccan and the Medinan parts of the Koran, which car- ried different messages. He called for a totally new revision of sharia, and was exe- cuted as an apostate by the Nimeiri regime in Sudan in 1985. The main points of his  thought are as follows:  • The Meccan revelation constitutes the essential, universal, and unchangeable  principles of Islam, valid for all times.  • The Medinan revelation consisted of temporal rules suitable for the context of  tribal Arabia in the seventh century. The Medinan passages were concessions to  the backward and barbaric society of the time, and are irrelevant to the modern  age.                                                              34 Rippin, Muslims: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, vol. 2, 109–11.  35 Gerhard Lichtenthäler, “Muslim, Mystic and Martyr: The Vision of Mahmud Muhammad  Taha and the Republican Brothers in the Sudan: Towards an Islamic Reformation?” Islam et  Societes au Sud du Sahara 9 (November 1995).  7 3 </page> <page sequence="18"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  • The Meccan revelation mandates religious freedom and equality between the  sexes.  • Instead of returning to the original sunnah as well as to the Medinan passages,  Muslims should pursue an endless evolution of sharia based solely on the univer- salist principles of the Meccan passages.  • Ijtihad should be based on rational thought and on mystical reflection aimed at  understanding the metaphorical meanings of the Koran.  Shia Calls for Reform  Ali Shariati in Iran—Islamic Liberation Theology. Ali Shariati, the main ideologue of  the Iranian Islamic revolution, developed a revolutionary Islamic ideology very differ- ent from Khomeini’s traditional brand of theology.36 It was rooted in Western  existentialism, dialectical Marxism, and anti-imperialism as well as in reinterpreted  versions of Shiite Islam and Sufism.37 Shariati’s thought shared many similarities with  Christian Liberation Theology. He maintained that Islam is a revolutionary ideology  because, from its inception, it sided with the oppressed. Muhammad had fought for so- cial equality and surrounded himself with the deprived members of society.38 Shariati’s  ideology’s key goals were to:  • Integrate modernity with Islam, reinterpreting Islam in modern sociological  categories, while recasting Western political and sociological thought into a  Muslim idiom.  • Transform Islam into a mass revolutionary movement. Shariati posited an imag- ined early anti-clerical and revolutionary Alawi Shia Islam that needed to be re- vived in order to emancipate the masses from oppression. According to this view,  Muhammad and his companions were social reformers and revolutionaries.39                                                              36 Suroosh Irfani, Revolutionary Islam In Iran (London: Zed Books, 1983), 116; Dabashi, “Ali  Shariati’s Islam: Revolutionary Uses of Faith in a Post-Traditional Society,” Islamic Quar- terly 27: 4 (1983): 203.  37 The Sufi strand in Shariati’s thinking, including the impact of Jalal al-Din Rumi’s “Mas- navi,” and Massignon’s influence has been comparatively ignored by scholars, except for Ali  Rahnema. In Pioneers of Islamic Revival, Rahnema states that, in Massignon’s company,  Shariati underwent a significant inner transformation. See Ali Rahnema, ed. Pioneers of Is- lamic Revival (London: Zed Books, 1994), 212, 220–21. This is further elaborated in Ra- henma’s An Islamic Utopian, where Rahnema states that Shariati, during his student days in  Paris, was a research assistant to Massignon, and that Massignon became his spiritual master  (pir).

Islamic societies need a similar religious reformation  that will unleash similar energies, lead to “a great leap forward,” and move them  from passive fatalism and blind obedience to learned men and clerics (the ulama)  to become a dynamic force in the world, reaching the level of Western societies  in one generation.42  • Undermine the ulama’s monopoly over religion by accusing them of creating a  false Islam. They were reactionaries who limited themselves to “philosophy, the- ology, jurisprudence, conjugation, and syntax,” diverting people’s attention from  the real causes of their misery and ignoring the core truths of Islam.43  ‘Abdul Karim Sorush. A leading Iranian intellectual and philosopher, he further de- veloped Shariati’s ideas by adopting a view of Islam influenced by Western phenome- nology and liberal Christian theology. One of his key teachings was that Islam bears  many interpretations that vary with time and context. Imposing a fixed interpretation  makes Islam rigid, superficial, and one-dimensional. Related to this point was his con- tention that God and his revelation are eternal and immutable, but religion is relative,  because it exists in the realm of human understanding and language, where everything  is relative. Sacred texts do not change, but their interpretations should always be in  flux.  Sorush distinguished between fundamentals (usul) and branches (furu’) of Islam.  He also held that traditional fiqh cannot provide solutions for Muslims in the modern  world, and that Islam needs a new, dynamic and forward-looking fiqh, which will be  able to address the problems of Muslims in modern contexts. The final distinguishing  point of Sorush’s thought is that the will of the majority must shape the ideal Islamic  state, not the dictates of the ulama, and that there is no contradiction between Islam  and the freedoms inherent in democracy.44                                                              40 Ibid., 1; Shariati, Martyrdom: Arise and Bear Witness, 78.  41 Ali Shariati, On the Sociology of Islam, trans.

They claim the right to  participate in the contemporary processes of reclaiming, redefining, and implementing  Islam. They reject dogmatic, extremist, and intolerant forms of Islam that cannot pro- vide solutions to the complexities of the modern world. Their tenets include:  • Belief that the Koranic universal principles of equality, justice, and freedom (in- cluding equal rights for women) override opposing rules set forth in traditional  sharia.45  • An opposition to continuing attempts to impose hudud punishments (such as the  death sentence for apostasy) and traditional sharia law at both federal and state  levels in Malaysia.  • Interpretation of the Koran on the reformist principles of stressing the eternal  validity of a few fundamental universalist principles that override other verses or  hadith that seem to contradict them, as well as on harmonization, which gives  equal weight to all verses and denies the validity of the abrogation principle.  • An opposition to Islamism, which promotes an intolerant vision of an Islamic  state—a dictatorial, theocratic, and inherently inequitable system that allocates  different rights to men than to women, and to Muslims than to non-Muslims.46  • Calls for the doors of ijtihad to be reopened.  • Recognition of the Koran as divine revelation, but interpretation of the Koran as  a human effort that leads to diverse opinions. This diversity is a positive value  that enables Islam to survive in a variety of cultures and societies while preserv- ing its universalist message.  • A conviction that the interpretation of the source texts and ijtihad must not be left  in the hands of an exclusive elite group like the ‘ulama, who isolate the text both  from its socio-historical context and from contemporary contexts. Sisters in Islam  promote lay interpretations of the Muslim scriptures, arguing that all Muslims  should be involved in the discourse of what kind of Islam is right at this time.

In his Tafhim al-Koran he hoped to present a unitary “Islamic mes-                                                             45 “About SIS: Mission,” Sisters in Islam homepage, at: www.muslimtents.com/sistersinislam/  about/content1.htm.  46 “Islam, Apostasy and PAS,” Resources @Sisters in Islam (22 July 1999).

He believed a number of factors  would bring about this transformation. First, Islam, as a total ideological system, must  come to dominate all areas of public life (political, societal, economic), as well as per- sonal matters and private worship. In line with the view that Islam should control all  affairs of political life is Mawdudi’s teaching that the Koran is a revolutionary mani- festo and a manual for Islamist activists—it is an implicitly political work.  In implementing the political and social order called for in the Koran, a highly mo- tivated vanguard of enlightened Muslims would act as catalysts of the Islamic revolu- tion. Once this vanguard had succeeded in creating a truly Islamic state, this state— ruled by sharia—will solve all problems that Muslims face worldwide. Mawdudi  taught that jihad is the way to alter the ideology and social order. While embracing the  classic military understanding of Islam, he also considered jihad to cover non-violent  means such as campaigning for change by speech and writing.47  Sayyid Qutb (1907–66). Sayyid Qutb was the primary ideologue of the Muslim  Brotherhood in Egypt during the rule of President Nasser (1954–70) and is viewed as  the godfather of Islamist radicalism. Qutb wrote a commentary called Fi Zilal al-Koran  (“In the Shade of the Koran”), which is extremely popular in the contemporary Muslim  world. His axiom was that Islam is a perfect system that integrates freedom, equality,  and social justice and is in accord with the cosmic order and the laws of nature. He  embeds his radical interpretation of Islam in the Koranic text, using Koranic stories  and concepts as paradigms applicable to the modern world. Among his primary con- cepts are:  • Islam is a comprehensive ideology that must regulate all aspects of life by imple- menting sharia as the legal system of the state.  • Reason and public welfare are important principles of interpretation, but only  within the framework of Islamic rules.  • The paganism of Muhammad’s time (jahiliyya) is replicated in the neo-paganism  of the modern secular world, both Western and Muslim. Pharaoh is the prototype  of the evil dictators and tyrants of today who want to destroy Islam; Moses is the  prototype of the true Muslim leader who fights to liberate his people by bringing  them under the yoke of sharia—true worship of God.  • Strong opposition to traditional commentaries that were atomistic in their ap- proach to the Koran. His approach is holistic, seeing the Koran as a unity that  mirrors and demands the unity of the Muslim umma.48  • Promotion of the Khariji doctrine of takfir, the process of judging Muslims— whether individuals, regimes, societies, or states—to be apostates or infidels if                                                              47 Sayyid Abu’l A’la Mawdudi, Jihad fi Sabilillah [Jihad in Islam], trans.

They must be fought, killed, and re- placed.  • A transformation in the understanding of the hijra (emigration), from the tradi- tional description of Muhammad’s migration to Medina to an interpretation of the  hijra as a distinct stage in the development of the contemporary ideal Islamic  state. Hijra should be the response of true Muslims to the state of ignorance and  immorality prevalent in society.  • Employing a term previously reserved for the paganism of pre-Islamic Arabia, he  called this ignorance and immorality jahiliyya.49  • Identification of all jahili societies as the enemy, thus supplying a specific focus  for revolutionary action. Jahiliyya is always evil in whatever form it manifests it- self, as it is always seeking to crush true Islam.  • Jihad by force must be used to annihilate jahili regimes and replace them with  true Muslim ones.50 He emphasized the qital (fighting) aspect of jihad,51 and  strongly rejected any solely defensive interpretation.52 He saw jihad as a method  for actively seeking to free all peoples on earth from non-Islamic authority.53  Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (1703–92). Al-Wahhab founded a puritanical and  militant reform movement based on the Hanbali madhab and on ibn-Taymiyya’s  teachings. He linked his movement to the House of Saud, and this strictly puritanical  Wahhabism remains the predominant Islamic movement within Saudi Arabia today. He  considered Muslim society at the time to have reverted to paganism (jahiliyya), and  thus revived the Khariji practice of takfir, in which he condemned all Muslims he dis- agreed with as apostates in order to justify fighting jihad against them. He rejected all  innovations that occurred after the third Islamic century, and urged a return to the Ko- ran and sunnah in a pious interpretative attempt (ijtihad) to understand and implement  their fundamentals. He condemned Sufis and Shia as apostates for adopting supersti-                                                             49 Yvonne Y.

Salafis  The Salafis view the first three generations of Muslims (Muhammad’s companions,  and the two succeeding generations after them—the pious forbears, al-salaf al-salih) as  the perfect examples of how Islam should be practiced. This principle is derived from  the hadith of Muhammad: “The best of people is my generation, then those who come  after them, then those who come after them”—i.e. the first three generations of Mus- lims (Bukhari 3:48:819 and 820; Muslim 31:6150 and 6151).  Islam was perfect and complete in the days of Muhammad and his companions, but  a great deal of undesirable “innovation” (bid’a) was added to Islam afterwards.  Salafism seeks to revive the original practice of Islam. Salafis are preoccupied with  hadith as the main basis of their fatwas. Sound hadith must be distinguished from un- sound ones. Some were falsely attributed to sahaba and tabi’un but cannot be traced  back to them when the isnad is investigated. Special consideration with regard to  hadith must be given to Jewish material (isra’iliyat), which was sorted and evaluated.  Other material that crept in due to theological, philosophical, political, and other con- siderations, also needed to be re-evaluated. False hadith purposely introduced by the  enemies of Islam must be distinguished from sound material.  Salafis are divided into three movements:  • Purists, who reject forms of political or organizational activism that divide the  Muslim community and divert attention from the study of Islam and the propaga- tion of Salafism. They see jihad in defensive terms, and accept a jihad only when  led by a legal Muslim government. They argue that it is forbidden for Muslims to  revolt against a Muslim government, no matter how oppressive or unjust.  • Activists, who agree with the Muslim Brotherhood and similar movements that  political activism is the best method for achieving the goal of an Islamic state un- der sharia.  • Salafi-Jihadists, who advocate violence and terror and actively promote rebellion  against the state and all perceived enemies of Islam. This third movement is the  primary source of Islamist terrorism around the world. It emerged during the anti- Soviet jihad in Afghanistan when jihadi, Wahhabi, Deobandi, and other groups  cooperated and intermingled in their fight against the common enemy. It was  strengthened during the 1991 Gulf War, when the more radical Saudi Salafis re- jected reliance on U.S. troops in the Arabian Peninsula to protect Saudi Arabia  from Iraqi aggression.54                                                              54 Juan Jose Escobar Stemmann, “Middle East Salafism’s Influence and the Radicalization of  Muslim Communities in Europe,” Middle East Review of International Affairs 10:3 (Sep- tember 2006).  7 9 </page> <page sequence="24"> THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL  Progressives  Progressives want to reform Islam by Westernizing it. They accept the separation of  religion and state. They reinterpret the Koran and hadith according to secular and lib- eral Western concepts of human rights, multiculturalism, and feminism. They are also  willing to use Western academic tools of textual criticism to examine the Muslim  scriptures. Modernists were influential in the 1920s and 1930s and in the early days of  independence in the various Muslim states. However, their freedom of expression is  now firmly restricted in most Muslim states, where they are currently under tremen- dous pressure from Islamists and traditionalists. They face charges of apostasy and  blasphemy, as well as threats of violence and death. As a result, many have emigrated  to the West.  Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd.55 On 14 June 1995, the Appeals Court in Cairo, Egypt,  ruled that Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd, a professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at  Cairo University, was an apostate from Islam, and ordered his separation from his wife,  Dr. Ibtihal Yunis, an assistant professor of French at Cairo University. Following death  threats, Professor Abu-Zayd fled Egypt with his wife, and now lives in exile in Bel- gium.   Abu-Zayd is a liberal academic who claims to be a devout Muslim. He extended his  linguistic research to the study of Islamic source texts of Koran and hadith. According  to him, the Koran is the revelation of God’s words, but it is also a cultural product and  a historical phenomenon, given in a specific time and place. The historical text is sub- ject to human understanding and interpretation. While the text is originally divine, it is  also historical, and its interpretation is absolutely human. The Koran and the authentic  traditions must be analyzed within the context in which they originated (similar to the  Western tradition of historicist criticism). The interpretations of the first Muslim gen- eration and of the generations that followed are not final or absolute. To understand  and interpret the text today, we must use socio-historical analysis as well as modern  linguistic methodologies.  Abu-Zayd championed allegorical and metaphorical readings of the texts, because  they allow the reinterpretation of religious law according to its spirit rather than its  letter. He urged that an analysis of the Koranic text in its contextual cultural reality  must begin with empirical historical facts. Through the analysis of such facts, a scien- tific understanding of the Koran can be established. Interpretive diversity is necessary,  and imposing uniformity leads to the degeneration of the message. Since the message  of Islam is universally valid for all, diversity of interpretation is inevitable. Awareness  of the difference between the Koran’s fixed original contextual meaning and the  changeable significance of that meaning will produce interpretations that can accom- modate themselves to changing contexts.                                                              55 Fauzi M.

Western attempts to reinterpret certain Islamic themes, such  as violence, jihad, and terrorism are most likely to fail. Muslims react with hurt pride  and scorn at any such attempts. At the most, Western governments and scholars can  encourage Muslim scholars who interpret their sources in peaceful, non-violent ways.  However, it is imperative that Westerners and Muslims accept and admit that vio- lence and jihad are part of the Muslim source texts. They cannot be wished away. At  best they can be marginalized by a reinterpretation that prioritizes the peaceful parts of  the source texts by various means (as do a variety of reformist and progressive scholars  and movements within Islam).  Western governments have made the mistake of dealing with Islamist movements  as though they are the authentic representatives of Muslim communities and of Islam in  general, thus further empowering them. A better strategy would be to marginalize these  groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, Jama’at-i-Islami, Deoband, and the Sala- fis/ Wahhabis, as these are the movements that take the jihad passages of the Koran  most seriously. Instead, groups that follow progressive interpretations that would limit  the applicability of the violent passages to the early period of Islam, and that prioritize  the peaceful ones as being the universal and eternal principles of Islam, should be en- couraged and supported until they become the dominant forces in the Muslim world.  This might take a long time, as the radical groups still enjoy access to funding from oil- rich states and have managed to project themselves as the dominant force in contempo- rary Islam. Their power must be broken as the progressive forces are empowered,  given greater resources, and supported to become a political force with the means to  take over the leadership of global Islam as well as each individual Muslim state.  8 1 </page> <page sequence="26">  </page> </plain_text>
