<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AND THE END OF CIVILIZATION Joseph M. Hallman / College of St. Thomas Teilhard de Chardin assessed modernity as the end for which humanity was created, believing that all disease and hunger would "be conquered by science" and that "hatred and internecine struggles" would disappear "in the ever warmer radiance of Omega. . . . The final convergence will take place in peace." Yet his optimism was moderated by the possibility of certain "darker eventualities." Obeying a law from which nothing in the past has ever been exempt, evil may go on growing alongside good, and it too may attain its paroxysm at the end in some specifically new form.1 Teilhard also projected other more concrete evils, such as "the exhaustion of the physical resources of the planet" and an "ecstasy of discord, a strike in the noosphere."2 Although this theme does not predominate in his writings, it does suggest, in the light of more recent political, social, and economic developments in the world, that theology ought to become less optimistic about the future than it has been. I would like to formulate this view by stating it directly, and by exploring its reasonable consequences. The theological question is this: should we continue to expect and to hope for the development of a global technological society which projects a future of world peace, health, and justice? Or rather, ought we to expect the end of modern Western civilization as we know it now? The second prospect seems more likely now than in Teilhard's time. Even if destruction does not occur suddenly by a single blow such as a nuclear holocaust, the gradual decline of Western civilization is a distinct possibility. Although one can only speculate here, signs of decay are certainly present. Inflation, the exhausted supply of fossil fuel, the incapacity of governments to govern, our lack of devotion to common social goals, increasing sexual decadence and drug use, the decline of our educational system?one can go on and on. We or our children might live in a society in which paper money buys virtually nothing, in which automobiles and furnaces have no fuel, with hordes of barbarians at the gates. How shall we prepare ourselves for these possible catastrophes as religious people? I suggest that we construct a contemporary theology of divine judgment by using some insights developed especially by 1. P.

A post-modern Christian understanding of history needs to develop a theology of judgment to confront the disruptive evils of social decline and possible destruction. And such a theology of judgment ought to address the question of individuals as well as of societies. Judgment of the Individual To say that God can judge individuals is to make an assertion with two possible difficulties: it might bring to mind the anthropomorphic image of human courts of law; besides this, God's judgment seems to conflict with God's love. The theological task is to show that God judges and loves us in a divine manner and not in a human way. Secondly, God's judgment and love must be reconciled with each other. The analogy which describes God as a judge is that of a human person who evaluates the evidence and makes a determination as to the guilt of the offender. In a rational construction, God cannot be a "super-person," such as a physically large and robed woman or man, holding court in splendid but literal heavenly chambers. The abstract qualities of judging are necessary for theology and these are: the discernment and evaluation of facts and determination of guilt and punishment. If God can discern and evaluate evidence and determine guilt as God, we may correctly believe that God is a judge, acting in a manner which is analogous to human judging. If God is the supreme being who knows everything which has happened in the world, God has all the evidence necessary to make a correct determination of guilt. This seems to present very little problem, since God is usually seen as omniscient. But if we examine the second capacity carefully, there is an underlying difficulty with determination of guilt. Did not God know all along what would happen in this world? Is not divine judgment therefore necessarily an eternal judgment based upon divine foreknowledge? We are led from the question of divine judgment to the question of divine knowledge, and divine predestination. The traditional theology of divine knowledge has been attacked by process theologians as well as others.3 All one logically has to hold is that the way in which God knows the future is different from the way God knows the past and the present. God knows the future because God can predict it, at least the near future, almost infallibly. God need not, however, contrary to the Augustinian view, know the future in its present-ness. The sum total of God's knowledge of the past, and God's completely exhaustive experience of the present, allow God to predict the future with the highest possible degree of 3.

Joseph M. Hallman</page><page sequence="3">112 certitude, but not to know it in the certain way that God knows the present. Therefore God knows the future precisely as future and not as past or present. Thus God is the only perfect knower in the world, but does not know the future except as it is predictably based upon the past and present. Divine knowledge of what happens to us as individuals is true knowledge, since it is not seen as happening ahead of time. This assumption may allow us reasonably to believe that God can condemn where God formerly loved, or vice versa, but two things are still missing: asking whether God changes God's attitude toward us, and the formulation of a precise description of and distinction between divine loving and divine judgment. If God does not change the divine attitude toward us in response to our temporal situation, we need not and indeed cannot make any real distinction between divine love and divine judgment. We must either choose between them as Marcion did, or collapse one into the other. Some theologians have turned the less attractive quality of divine judgment into the divine loving, so that judgment/condemnation of God becomes an act of benevolence on God's part. God condemns us in order to make us better. This makes judging essentially an act of loving condemnation since God only loves us no matter what we do. Thus God need not change God's attitude toward us, and we need not distinguish theologically between divine judging and divine loving. There are biblical texts which support this move as well as theological tradition.5 Theology should probably weaken the divine wrathful judgment in favor of providential loving condemnation of persons; however, one then deals with the question of heaven and hell. Judgment of Societies The question about God's judgment of the individual does not present the same issues as the case of judgment of societies. That which is judged in this second case is the social order itself in some sense. It is this sense which theology needs to understand to connect judgment with social decline or destruction. If we presume that in judging society, God does not judge or condemn persons, but only structures insofar as they can be separated from persons, we are able to distinguish successfully between the two cases. Economic, social, and political relationships always exist which are not under the control of individuals. They are deeply embedded in society as its tradition, and their handing-on is to a great extent unconscious. This is especially the case for older societies. Some of these structures operate in ways which frustrate the divine will to impart the salvation which God continually offers. Therefore God judges them negatively, and works in divine manner for their downfall. There is no apparent contradiction between God's loving judgment of individuals and God's condemning judgment of some structures. Each is directed toward something different. Judgment is directed against some 4. An example here is Origen in First Principles 2.10.4; also Contra Celsum 4.72. 5. See especially the book of Hosea. The theme of divine forgiveness in the prophets suggests that God's judgment is reversible, that is, not ultimate, and that God's mercy eventually triumphs. God and the End of Civilization</page><page sequence="4">113 structures at the same time as love is directed toward all persons. Because of our starting point, we have yet to ask whether God loves any society more than any other, or whether God's mind can change about a given society. Does God love or hate entire societies, or only some of their structural relationships? The most straightforward answer to this question is that God has no concern about entire societies at all, and that to God one set of social, political, and economic relationships can be as good and as bad as any other. Although this weakens the biblical idea that God condemns or elects nations, it does solve the theological problem of divine change or difference of attitude toward an entire society. At the same time, it preserves the idea that certain structures of every society can be negated by God. Those structures of any society, be they economic, social, or political, which interfere with the divine offer of salvation, are condemned. After justifying this by an appeal to the attitude of Jesus, I shall attempt to avoid anthropomorphism by arguing that this type of judgment takes no new act on God's part. Jesus The best warrant for taking the direction of divine neutrality toward entire societies is the attitude of Jesus. Modern theologians are sometimes embarrassed by the saying of Jesus that we ought to pay taxes to a foreign dominating power by rendering to Caesar. And some New Testament injunctions regarding slaves and women are quite bothersome today. In an age of equality and revolution, these elements of the New Testament message are unacceptable if taken literally. One could speculate that Jesus had the perfect opportunity to join the new Zealot revolutionary movement which originated in the very district of his residence, and apparently he did not. His attitude toward the social, political, and economic order was neutral, and only when these impinged upon God's will for the individual did the social relationships deserve condemnation. One must still pay Caesar if one decides to follow Jesus. In spite of repeated attempts to force the historical Jesus into the model of social revolutionary, he was basically only concerned with the individual and her or his relationship with God. His feelings about Jewish-Roman society were presumably the same as those of God: he was neutral except in those instances where the structures interfered with God's salvific will for the individual. Thus he condemns Jewish temple practices and Pharisaic interpretation of the Sabbath, but not the payment of taxes to Rome, or the social status of slaves and women. Each social structure is judged independently. One might suggest that foreign domination, slavery, and the inequality of women did not impede God's offer of salvation then. But now they do! No New Act God need not change God's attitude toward a given society to condemn its structures by a special act, but naturally condemns when divine love for individuals is inhibited by structure. God works lovingly and persuasively for the downfall of some structures but only through God's constant love for the individual. To accomplish God's goal, history takes its course. God persuades Joseph M. Hallman</page><page sequence="5">114 individuals to regroup themselves in ways which are more open to the divine loving attitude toward them. I am assuming in this paper that God does not totally control societies or individuals according to divine will, but must allow them freely to run their course. I also assume the rationality of the assertion that God does feel love toward us as individuals in a manner which is analogous to the way in which we feel. Both assumptions need some explanation. Freedom and God's Love Process theology generally holds that God's action in regard to history is strongly determinative, but partial. In the conception of God which underlies this essay, God urges the implementation of abstract possibilities such as justice and equality and it is God's persuasive urging of their historical relevance which allows us to be persuaded to implement them. When we perceive the power of these ideals, we are perceiving something of the divine in them, and are urged to implement them, perhaps by means of social change. The principle that God does not totally determine the future of society is coherent with belief in human freedom, and this second belief has long been seen as a sine qua non for religion and theology in spite of traditional problems of foreknowledge and predestination. The second assumption, that God feels love in some manner which is analogous to the way in which we do, seems difficult to establish theologically even though the Bible and religion are unequivocal about it. For centuries our theological tradition (with important exceptions such as Tertullian and Lactantius) has presented a view of God as not truly capable of emotions. It is surprising that, for theologians, God's love of us seemed unworthy of the divine. A good example of this is contained in a text of Augustine's De Doctrina Christi ana.S "How does God love?" he asks. Does God love us to enjoy us or to use us? If God enjoys us, Augustine says, God needs our good, and no sane person would say this. God is our every good, or else every good we have comes from God. Therefore God does not need our good, and therefore God does not enjoy us. Since God does not enjoy us, God must use us. For, writes Augustine in apparent desperation, if God does not enjoy us, or use us, I cannot discover how God loves us! He hastens to point out, however, that God does not use us the way we use created things. God's use of us, or God's love of us, is collapsed by Augustine into God's causing us to exist, and that is all God's loving of us means. Divine creation is the only meaning that divine love has. Many theologians now hold that a personal God who does not feel the 6. 1.31.34 - 32.35. Text io CCL 32, p. 36. God and the End of Civilization</page><page sequence="6">115 particulars of the world in some responsive manner is unbiblical and generally unknown to Christian religious experience. Hopefully, God's feelings can be rationally described without impairing divine perfection. If one wants to show that God is fully personal, a theology of divine emotions is necessary. For this a more technical and lengthy justification is needed than what I have provided here. Conclusion What I have provided is the suggestion that one can reasonably believe in the divine judgment of persons and of social structures without anthropomorphism and irrationality. The quality of "discernment and evaluation of evidence" and "determination of guilt" pertain to God because God is receptive to our deeds without knowing what they will be ahead of time. God judges persons only in the sense of loving them as they are and as they come to be. God's naturally negative response to some social structures by which divine love for individuals is frustrated is what is meant by God's judgment of the nations. God does not actively seek revolution, decline or destruction. God acts as a reservoir of love and potentiality for individuals who may indeed choose to opt for goals which involve these future situations. God does not love any entire society more than any other. God also does not condemn societies except insofar as they impede divine will for the salvation of the individuals. And although God does have attitudes about social structures, God is not in complete control of their destinies. To contemplate the end of modern society as we know it, and even to theologize about it in preparation, are to assume that some of its economic, social, and political relationships directly impede the divine offer of salvation. Materialism, hostility and greed are the results to some extent of structures which need changing. In the coming demise of Western civilization, there may be new persuasive calls for heroic religiosity, for renewal and rebuilding upon whatever structures remain. In the meantime, we wait, watch, work, and pray that the initial assumption of this essay is mistaken. 7. J?rgen Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, trans.
