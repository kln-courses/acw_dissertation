There is no label providing a provenance of the sculptures, which were obtained from a private collection in Yucatán and were hitherto considered as of unknown place of origin. Regarding the former history of the two pieces, no addi- tional information could be obtained, but as will be illumi- nated in the following, the two fragments show conspicuous stylistic parallels in relief-carving, calligraphy and format with at least one monument of reported origin; namely Mis- cellaneous Sculpture 1 from Tzocchen (Pollock 1980: 465, Figure 778; also published in Mayer 1995, Plate 62; see Figure 4). Little is known about the site of Tzocchen, despite the brief report by Harry E.D. Pollock (1980: 465), who states that the ruins are situated "some 2 km or a little more north by west of Cumpich and 1 km plus north of Haltun- chon". The same ruins which Pollock named Tzocchen are 2 presently located in and on the border of the village called Fig. 1 : Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3 in the Museo del Pueblo Maya , Dzibilchaltun. Photo by Jesús Guillermo Kantún Rivera, 2014 (used with kind permission) Dzotchen (Mexicon VI(3): 32), Campeche. Regarding the hieroglyphic fragment that he designated as Miscellaneous Sculpture 1 (Ml, see Figure 4), Pollock notes that it was "built into stairway of main house of hacienda", and: "As the ruins have been quarried to provide stone for the construction of the hacienda, little remains of the ancient architecture. I saw no standing building or even fragments of masonry, but only mounds" (Pollock 1980: 465). His measurements of 63 cm in height, 32 cm in width (not including border) and 15 cm depth for the now missing Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 1 seem to correspond well with the measurements of the two sculptures that are now exhibited in the Museo del Pueblo Maya and strengthen the assumption about a shared provenance of the three pieces. This proposal was first made by Karl Herbert Mayer (pers. comm., 2014) and it is the aim of the present note to provide further evidence by means of a brief comparative analysis. Due to the fact that no archaeological surveys have been conducted at the ruins of Tzocchen so far and even the present location of Ml is unknown, the exact provenance, meaning the building from which it was looted, and the original ar- chaeological setting of the fragments remain elusive. It can be assumed that the entire structure has been dismantled and the stones used as construction material for the nearby haci- enda, as Pollock reported for Ml. Nonetheless, for reasons explained further below, the two previously unpublished frag- ments can confidently be designated as Tzocchen Miscellane- ous Sculpture 2 (abbreviated as M2, see cover and Figure 2) and Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3 (M3, Figs. 1 and 3), respectively, and they will be treated as such in the following. Fragment 1 (Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 2) The smallest of the three glyphic relief panels measures 47 cm in total height and between 30 (top) - 32 (bottom) cm in width (pers. comm., Jesús Guillermo Kantún Rivera, 2014). mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 20 15</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2: Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 2. Drawing by Guido Krempel, 2014 It preserves six glyph blocks arranged in a double column, surrounded by a frame of approximately 3 cm (see front cov- er and Figure 2). The plain border is mostly flaked off and abraded; however, sufficient portions remain of the upper border to assume that this fragment formed the beginning of a dedicatory text. This assumption is confirmed by the initial sequence (Al-Bl) a-ALAY-ya K'AL-la "Here, is bound/presented (?) which usually marks the beginning of dedicatory sentences. The next glyph block (B2) is heavily eroded and hard to discern, but the remaining outlines may suffice to propose the reading u-tz'i-ba?-li? "the writing of/ his writing". Thereafter follows the block ma-MAN-ni/li? man or manil , a term that is often attested in contexts of cer- tain nominal phrases referring to so-called "vision-serpents" (see Lopes 2003; Jorgensen and Krempel 2014 for discus- sions of the MAN sign in different semantic contexts). The meaning of the term man or manil in this context remains obscure so far. However, I suspect that it forms part of, or initiates, a nominal phrase which would continue with the next two blocks. Unfortunately, the lower portion of the last two glyph blocks (pA3-pB3) is broken off and therefore not readable with any certainty. However, some portions can still be discerned. The first sign seems to be an unconventionally upside-down reed sign, AJ, (or, alternatively, three bars and two dots designating the number 1 7, but then likewise uncon- ventionally upside-down) followed by the head of a feline, most likely a variant of BALAM "Jaguar". The lower jaw of the animal's head is broken off, but can still be recognized as "feline-like" with a prominent pointing fang. The glyph block in B3 is clearly the head of a fish with anthropomorphic facial features, undoubtedly the syllable ka-. Not enough detail is preserved of the last sign, for which reason this name can only tentatively and incompletely be transcribed as: MAN?-ni? AJ?/17?-BALAM? ka-...? mani aj bahlam? kan?. Fig. 3: Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3. Drawing by Guido Krempel, 2014 The dedicatory text on Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 2 can thus be surmised as follows: Al: a-ALAY-ya alay "Here, so" B 1 : K'AL-la k 'al "is bound/presented (?)" A2: u-tz'i*-ba*-li* u tz'ibal "the writing of/for" B2: ma-MAN-ni?/li? mani /manili "vision???" A3: A J?/l 7?-BALAM?/ba? aj? bahlam? . . ."Jaguar? ..." B3: ka-? ka...? "?" alay k' al u tz 'ibal man(il?) ajl bahlam! ka...l "Here is presented the/his writing (of?) Man(il?) Aj? Bahlam? Ka...?" Fragment 2 (Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3) The second fragment exhibited in the Museo del Pueblo Maya is slightly bigger in size, measuring 53.5 cm in total height and 39 - 40 cm in width (pers. comm. Jesús Guiller- mo Kantún Rivera, 2014), and likewise preserves six glyph blocks arranged in a double column (see Figures 1 and 3). Unfortunately, the surrounding frame is highly abraded, but it is still recognizable that the panel originally had a border at the lower end, whereas at the top the remains can be seen of two more glyph blocks through which looters seemingly have sawn off this fragment by means of a horizontal cut. Due to the fact that the upper glyphs cannot be recognized anymore, it remains unclear if this upper part matches the lower section of the other fragment(s). However, at first glance and from what can be discerned from available photos, none of the three fragments presented here seems to match directly with any of the others, nor can a clear match be drawn syntacti- cally. However, at least the sizes of 32 cm in width measured for M2 and M3 seem to correspond well. Notwithstanding the slightly varying size of the two frag- ments, the similarities of this very peculiar relief carving style 3 mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="4">as well as the similar depth of the relief carving lead us to as- sume that these fragments both stem from a single workshop tradition, possibly from the same architectural feature, and that they were perhaps carved by a single artist. The first glyph block is composed of two signs, one being a sign depicting a hand, maybe the logograph TZUTZ but in fact not clearly recognizable, followed by a full form of the syllable -ma (alternatively, a second ma syllable could be intended, thus, ?-ma-ma ...? mam). In position pB2 there follows the collocation ha-[i] ha 'i' "here, this is". Follow- ing a suggestion by Nikolai Grube (pers. comm. 2015), the infixed i-sign could serve to stress the disharmonie spelling of this lexeme as haa '. The reading of the next sign is chal- lenging. It seems to have similarities with a common variant of the syllable e, usually depicted as the head of a reptile (probably a toad) with open fauces and the typical gland with three dots. However, in this case, the animal has two unusual fang-like teeth rather than the typical toad mouth. In the cheek on the head another sign is infixed that looks like i', or alternatively it might be a variant for TE'. Together with the following block in pB3, which possibly designates ba-hi b 'aah "image/representation", a reasonable transcription of this sequence as ha-i' e?-TE'? ba-hi haa' (y)eetb 'aah? "this here is the companion-image of...", seems convincing (pers. com., Nikolai Grube, 2015). An alternative reading of the sequence would take the block in pA3 as an unusual variant for the third person singular pronoun u, resulting in u ba-hi u b 'aah "the image/representation of...". The penultimate glyph then probably provides us with a personal name, composed of the glyphs CHAK-hi-HIX?. CHAAK- [ko] c hak koj? hix chaakl "Great/Red-(Fang-?)Ocelot-Chaak", possibly depict- ing an aspect of the rain and war-associated deity Chaak with feline features, prominent fangs, nocturnal eye, and a spon- dylus shell as ear-flare to indicate features of Chaak. Due to abrasion, it remains unclear whether the syllable ko is infixed above the spondylus earflare of the deity. If so, the name can be transcribed as chak ko(j)l hix chaakl "Great-Fanged Ocelot-Chaak"; a name that corresponds well with the facial characteristics depicted here. Without the additional ko infix, the name would be translated as chak hix chaakl "Great/Red Ocelot-Chaak". Finally, the text ends with a partially broken off glyph block which can confidently be reconstructed as the common title i'-tz'a-ti itz'aat "sage", thereby underscoring that the entire text was dedicated to a noble (or his sacred manifestation) named Chak (Koj?) Hix Chaak?. The text on Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3 can thus be translated as: pAl: ?-?-? pBl: 1-1-1 pA2: ?-ma(-ma?) ... ?..-m/...? mam? "???" pB2: ha-[i'] haa' "here, this is" pA3: e-TE'/u eet?/(y)eet?/u? "his companion?-..." pB3: ba-hi b 'aah "image/representation" pA4: CHAK-hi-HIX?.CHAAK?-[ko?] chak ko(j) hix chaak "Great- Fang- Jaguar/Ocelot- Chaak" pB4: [i']-tz'a-ti itz'aat "sage" ...? ...? ...-mH... maml haa' l(y)eetb'aah?lul b' aah chak ko(jl) hiix chaakl itz 'aat "...-m?, this (here) is the (companion?) image of Great- 4 Fang(ed)? Ocelot/Jaguar-Chaak?, the sage/wise" Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 1 As mentioned above, the conspicuous similarities between the Ex-Faller fragments with the monuments reported from Tzocchen lead us to assume that they were carved by the same artist and probably belonged to one architectural feature. Thus, for the sake of completion and comparability, a brief analysis and drawing (Figure 4) of the Tzocchen fragment shall be presented here, too. The fragment photographed by Pollock (1980: 465, Fig- ure 788; see also Mayer 1995: Plate 62) measures 63 cm in height, 32 cm in width (not including the border), and is 15 cm thick. It is composed of at least ten fairly well-preserved glyph blocks arranged in similar double-columns in vertical order. Like the two Ex-Faller fragments, it is surrounded by a framing border for which Pollock did not provide detailed measurements. However, the photo allows for a rough esti- mate of 3 - 4 cm for the border and thus would match well the width of the border that surrounds the two other fragments. In this case, the frame is open on top and bottom and can be considered as incomplete, probably having been composed of more than the ten blocks that are visible on the only available photo of this piece (Courtesy of Peabody Museum Harvard University, Carnegie Institution of Washington Photo No. 40-9-92, see also Mayer 1995: Plate 62). A similar size of about 32 cm in depth corresponds well with the dimensions of Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 3, as mentioned above. The first clearly visible glyph in pA2 (Figure 4) shows a complex compound, read as K' AL k' al "bound/binding"; a common dedicatory verb that is frequently used in similar Fig. 4: Tzocchen Miscellaneous Sculpture 1. Drawing by Guido Krempel, 2014 (based on Carnegie Institution of Washington, Pho- to No. 40-9-92; published in Pollock 1980: 465, Figure 778, and Mayer 1995: Plate 62) mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="5">renderings - a hand sign holding certain celestial symbols in the hand, in this case the signs "star "(ekj and "moon". Alternatively, the moon sign could designate the syllable -ja in order to spell this verb as K'AL-la-ja k 'ahlaj "was bound" (lit. dedicated or presented). In position pB2 there follows the syllable yu and thereafter a partially abraded xu syllable depicting the head of a leaf-nosed bat. Due to the partially destroyed bat head, it remains unclear whether originally an additional syllabic sign lu was infixed into the xu head, as is often the case. Following this is a glyph depicting the head of a mammal, most likely a dog, with open mouth and its tongue conspicuously outstretched. The prominent round dot on the cheek of the animal further identifies it as a dog, given that another common logograph for OK "dog" is usually identi- fied by this feature, too. Nevertheless, one would expect a le syllable after the sequence yu-xu-(lu?)le? Following a hint by Albert Davletshin (pers. comm., Dezember 2014), a quick search in Yucatec dictionaries resulted in promising entries for the "Licking Dog"-sign (e.g. Barrera Vasquez 1980: 447- 448; Höfling and Tezucún 2000: 388, 763): leetz' nval. lamida. leetz' vact. lamer, cfr. aj leetz', ixleetz'. leetz'a'an parti. lamido [...] leetz'tik vt. lamerlo. A' pel'-ej tan-u-le(e)tz'- t-ik in-k'ab'. El perro está lamiendo mi mano. leetz'tik ubaj vr. lamerse. Given these entries and the matching visual rendering of the carved dog's head with outstretched tongue in pA3, it seems likely that the sign functions as the syllabic sign le, as indicated by the syntax and the preceding yu-xu-lu?/le? sequence. It has possibly been derived from the term leetz ' "to lick, licking", a CVC stem with its final syllable abbre- viated, thus LE(ETZ') resulting in le. Therefore, a reading of the "Licking Dog" as syllabic sign derived from the verb leetz ' seems convincing and leads to a reading of the ini- tial sequence as k'al y-uxul(e) or k'al y-uxulel. Note that a similar variant of the same sign, showing a dog's head with outstretched tongue, also appears in a different semantic context at Palenque (Temple of the Inscriptions, East Tablet, K1 1, see Figure 5), where it likewise has the phonetic value le: ... ta-AJAW-le ... ta ajawle... "...in rulership ... ". Based on this evidence, the sign has also been listed as le in the syllabic charts compiled by Linda Scheie, Nikolai Grube et al. for the notebooks of the Maya Hieroglyphic Workshops at Texas, Austin (e.g. Scheie and Grube 1994: 16; 2002: 16). Based on these visual templates of the head variant for le, I suggest that the more common and frequently used le sign was meant to depict (possibly a dog's) tongue, too (see Figure 6). Now returning briefly to the preceding glyphs in pB2, it is noteworthy to consider a very similar feature, namely the outstretched tongue pertaining to the bat head as well. I as- sume that the scribe skillfully merged the xu syllable (which itself is seemingly derived from the concept of xuul "whis- tling", referring to the typical sound of bats) with yet another le syllable by means of a bat head with outstretched (thus "licking") tongue in order to render yu-xu-[le] le y-uxulel "his carving/carved thing". Several renderings of this head variant are also attested at Sabana Piletas (pers. comm. Carlos Pallan Gayol, 2015), where seemingly both, the "licking dog- head", as well as "licking bat-head" were used in a-AJAW-le sequences (Figure 5b-d). Both animal heads are shown with outstreched tounge and with conspicious visual similarities with the more common le-sign (T188), leading to assume that each was meant as variants for le .The reading of the next glyph block (pB3) is challenging, too, given the highly abraded surface of the monument in this section. However, following a convincing suggestion by Christian Prager (pers. comm., 2015) the entire glyph block can be transcribed as u-wa?-ya?-bi-li? u waybil. The highly eroded final syllable might alternatively correspond to -yi, leading to a reasonable transliteration of this block as u-wa?-yi?-bi-li? u waybil "his dreaming/sleeping place". Such waybil (or wayib) structures were buildings in which supernatural beings, the wahy of certain deities and ancestors, were conjured up. As such, the term waybil is well-attested on small altars, portable objects, and in a great amount of monumental inscriptions that refer to actual buildings as u waybil k 'uh "the dreaming/sleeping place of the god/sacred" (see e.g. Freidel, Scheie and Park- er 1993: 188-193; Grube and Scheie 1990), or "domicile" (Houston and Stuart 1989: 11; Stuart 1998: 377). Due to the highly eroded surface of the glyphs in pB3, the transcription as u waybil remains tentative, and it is worth noting that an alternate and likewise reasonable reading of this sequence could be u-wo?-jo?-le?-li u woj olii "the hieroglyphs/words of..." (pers. comm., Nikolai Grube 2015). The next glyphs in positions pA4 - pB4 can clearly be discerned and transcribed as u-ki-ti ju-ji u kit juuj. Given that in the majority of attested cases the name of a specific deity follows the term u waybil , it can be assumed that Ukit Juuj "Ancestor/Father Iguana" was likely the name of a deity that was venerated through the commissioning of this "God's House" or "Domicile". The fact that Ukit Juuj is indeed a name is confirmed by the penultimate glyph (pA5) which probably provides a form of u?-K'A'ABA'-a?-ti? uk'a'ab'a'ti .... "is his name at ...", or simply u-K'A'ABA'-a? "is the name of...". Fig. 5: le-head- variants in the sequence ta-AJAW-le from a) Palen- que, Temple of the Inscriptions, East Tablet, Block KJ 1 .

It can be assumed therefore, that the name Ukit Juuj designates either the nominal phrase of an an- cestor or the name of a supernatural being associated with this building. When following the alternate transcription, the sen- tence could be read as k'al y-uxulel u wojol ukit juuj "bound/ presented are the carved hieroglyphs/words of Ukit Juuj". The last glyph block is not clearly recognizable due to the partially abraded section and obscurity of the Carnegie photo- graph. The second sign shows some similarities with typical "Puuc-style" variants of the syllabic sign jo. Nevertheless, I do not have a full reading of this block to offer so far. The reading of the text recorded on Tzocchen Miscella- neous Sculpture 1 can thus only partially be transcribed as follows: pAl: 1-1-1 alayl pBl: 1-1-1 pA2: K'AL-la k'al "is bound/presented" pB2: yu-xu-[le]?* y-uxule(l?) "the carving of' pA3: le pB3 : u-wa?-yi?-bi-li/u-wo?-jo?-le?-li u waybil/u woj olii "domicile/sanctuary of' (?)/"the hieroglyphs/words of..."(?) pA4: u-ki-ti ukit "ancestor/father" pB4: ju-ji juuj "Iguana" pA5: u?-K'A'B'A-a-ti? u k' a 'ab 'a ti "is his/the name (at?)" pB5: u?-?-jo?-? Ill 111 [alayl ...]* k'al yuxulel u waybil? lu wojolill ukit juuj u k'a'ab'a'ti ...111 "[here, so] is bound/presented his carved Waybil (?)/the carved hieroglyphs/words (?), Ukit Juuj is the name of/at ..." Concluding remarks In comparison, some individual renderings of signs, such as the nearly identical renditions of K'AL and the syllable la, and also the distinct inner relief carvings strengthen the hypothesis that the two fragments exhibited in the Museo del Pueblo Maya are related to each other, even though a direct connection cannot be established either physically or syn- tactically, due to other assumed missing portions. Certainly the most telling fact that can be illuminated based on the epigraphic analysis is the dedicatory formula k'al y-uxulel u waybill lu wojolill ukit juuj u k' a 'ab 'a "... bound/presented is his carved waybil?/hieroglyphs? of Ukiit Juuj is his name....". This sequence provides evidence that the three fragments, assuming that they once decorated the same architectural fea- ture, may have formed part of a building that was dedicated to either an ancestor or a supernatural being, possibly a patron deity, named Ukit Juuj "Ancestor/Father Iguana". The second fragment, Miscellaneous Sculpture 2, most likely formed the beginning of another dedicatory formula that may refer to yet another supernatural entity or designates the name of a historical personage who commissioned this text by stating: alay k'al u tz 'ibal man? aj? bahlam? kan? "here, so is bound/ presented? the writing of Man? Aj? Bahlam? Kan?" The third fragment possibly formed the end of a sentence and names yet another person, Chak Koj? Hix Chaak? Itz'aat. Whether the latter refers to a deceased ancestor or alterna- tively names the sage to whom this building belonged also 6 remains elusive. However, given that the name of the struc- ture or the deity associated with it can be identified as "Father Iguana" (Ukit Juuj), I assume that the name Chak Koj? Hix Chaak? refers to the person who commissioned the building to which the three fragments were originally attached. Judg- ing from their size and format, the three pieces could corre- spond well with a framed doorway with jambs decorating the entrance at each side, similar to examples attested at other sites in the Northern Maya Lowlands (see e.g. Graña-Behrens 2012), which makes it reasonable to assume that the pieces from Tzocchen originally formed part of fragmented door jambs or other decorative elements of a doorway. Neverthe- less, it seems clear that great portions of the text are missing, not allowing for a reconstruction of the original arrangement so far, and it can thus only be hoped that the corresponding architectural feature at the ruins of Tzocchen can be found in the future by means of thorough investigations in order to clarify their original settings and possibly reveal additional fragments pertaining to this inscription. Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank Karl Herbert Mayer for sharing his insights, research results, and reviews, as well as for continuously encouraging me to publish the present note. Furthermore, I am greatly indebted to Jesús Guiller- mo Kantún Rivera, who at my request kindly went to the Museo del Pueblo Maya at Dzibilchaltun twice in order to take photographs and measurements of the fragments, which provided useful templates for hopefully accurate drawings of the inscription. In this regard, I also would also like to thank Ángel Góngora and Susana Echevarría Castillo for having supported the documentation process, as well as the staff and the director of the museum, Diana Trejo Torres, for permission to publish the two artifacts in their custody. This note further benefitted greatly from fruitful discussions with my esteemed colleagues Albert Davletshin, Nikolai Grube, Carlos Pallán Gayol, Christian Prager, Elisabeth Wagner and Gordon Whittaker for which I am most grateful.
