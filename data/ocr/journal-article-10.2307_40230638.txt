<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume VI, Number 3, September 1976 The Causality of Finite Modes in Spinoza's Ethics JAMES G. LENNOX, University of Toronto A central difficulty in the way of understanding Spinoza's metaphysical system is that of reconciling two apparently contradic- tory theories of the causation of finite modes (i.e., individual entities) found in his Ethics^ The easiest way to present the problem is to place these two accounts side by side. A. All things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must forever exist, and must be infinite; that is to say, through that attribute they are eternal and infinite. (E1P21) A thing which has been determined to any action was necessarily so determined by God. (E1P26) Together, these propositions entail (at least) that (a) God is a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of any action, and (b) that anything so determined is eternal and infinite. Compare these implications with the following. All quotations from Spinoza are taken from Spinoza, Selections, ed., John Wild, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1930, which includes W.H. White's translation of the Ethics, R.H.M. Elwes' translation of the Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione (TdlE), and A. Wolf's translations of the Korte Verhaneling van God, de Mensch, en des zelfs Welstand (KV) and the Epistolae (Ep.). 1 A clear presentation of this problem can be found in Watt, A.J., "The Causality of God in Spinoza's Philosophy," Canadian journal of Philosophy, II, No. 2, 1972, pp. 178-80. 479</page><page sequence="2">fames G. Lennox B. An individual thing or a thing which is finite and has determinate existence cannot exist nor be determined to action unless it be determined to existence and action by another cause which is also finite and has a determinate existence; and again this cause cannot exist nor be determined to action unless by another cause which is also finite and determined to existence and action, and so on, ad /n fin/ turn. (E1P28) This proposition entails (a-)) that there are finite individuals and (b-|) that a necessary condition of any action of such finite individuals is the existence of another finite individual which determines it to action. Clearly, taken together (a) and (b) contradict both (a*]) and (bi).2 Apart from this formal contradiction, the paradigm for what constitutes a cause seems very different in A. and B. . The former suggests a single and unified source of all being and activity, while the latter argues for an infinite series of 'efficient' causes and their effects. The paradigm suggested by A. will here be termed the emanative theory of causality, that suggested by B., the serial theory. The following discussion will be dialetical in structure. I shall first outline the various ways in which Spinoza 'defines' causality, showing that they amount to one theory about what constitutes a cause. Some proposals for solving the apparent conflict between the emanative and serial theories will be critically examined, following which there will be a new proposal which hopefully avoids some of the difficulties of previous attempts. I. From various passages in the works of Spinoza, a number of different claims about what is a cause can be collected. 1. That which is productive of some other thing (E1P6, Dem., E1P28, Dem., E1P33, K.V.I.iii, p.67). 2. That from which something necessarily follows, or flows (E1D2, E1P16, E1P17, Schol., E1P21, E2P7,Corol.). (I am taking this to be equivalent to the claim that a cause is a necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of some entity or the occurence of some event.) 2 In syllogistic form, (a) and (b) together imply that: All things are and act through God's determination. Whatever acts through God's determination is infinite and eternal. Therefore, all things are infinite and eternal. This contradicts (a-|). At the same time, (a) implies that God is a necessary and sufficient condition of anything's existing or acting, which contradicts (b-\). 480</page><page sequence="3">Causation in Spinoza 3. That which is expressed in the true definition of some entity or event. (TdlE, p.7 &amp; pp.37-38) 4. That through which a thing is conceived (E1P18,Dem., E2D2). Superficially, these seem to be very different claims. Nonetheless, a closer examination of what Spinoza means in each case reveals an underlying unity of meaning. The reconciliation of 1. and 2. is accomplished by considering the argument of E1P33. Spinoza there claims that God must have produced things as he did in fact do so, and to prove this he notes, as is his manner, that its denial contradicts an earlier proposition, E1P16. It asserted that "all things have necessarily followed from the given nature of God, and from the necessity of His nature have been determined to existence and action in a certain manner." This amounts to the claim that 'Y is a product of X' (1.) is equivalent to stating that X is a necessary and sufficient condition for Y (2.). To understand the meaning of 3., it is necessary to be clear about what Spinoza means by a 'true definition'. Letter sixty expresses the meaning of this phrase clearly. I seek another [definition] , namely that a circle is the space which is described by a line of which one point is fixed and the other moveable. Since this definition expresses the efficient cause, I know that I can deduce from it all the properties of a circle etc. 3 A true definition is an expression of the efficient cause of the thing defined, from which all its properties can be deduced.4 This definition, then, will give the productive agent of what is defined, and will state that from which it necessarily follows. Thus the third 'meaning' given above is equivalent to the first two. The fourth description of causation above follows from his statement at the very opening of the Ethics that knowledge of 3 For the same concept of definition, cf. TdlE, pp. 27-28 and 37-38 in the Wild edition. 4 This bears interesting similarities to the notion of an "operational definition" introduced in this century by Bridgman: "...the concept of Length involves as mush as, and nothing more than, the set of operations by which length is determined." (The Logic of Modern Physics, New York, Macmillan, 1927, p. 5.) Spinoza could be paraphrased as saying that 'the concept of Circularity involves the set of operations by which a circle is determined'. Of course this mathematical example makes these two theories of definition seem more similar than they are, for normally the efficient cause of anything specified in a definition is, as far as Spinoza is concerned, Nature, not a human measurer. 481</page><page sequence="4">lames G. Lennox anything must be knowledge of its cause.5 Axiom III makes a determinate cause the necessary precondition of anything's existence and action, and this is followed by Axiom IV's insistence that "the knowledge of an effect depends upon and involves the knowledge of its cause." As we have already seen, this is the knowledge that true definitions give us. The TdlE gives us sufficient warrant for supposing that this amounts to knowledge of the essence of the definiendum. A definition, if it is to be called perfect, must explain the inmost essence of a thing, and must take care not to substitute any of its properties. Conceiving of anything is, then, to be aware of its essence, which is expressed as a definition of the efficient cause of the definiendum. This identification of the efficient cause of an entity with its essence underlies, I believe, Spinoza's account of the causality of finite modes; yet it is an identification which is not often stressed.6. The account given here will stress its importance. II. Before the solutions of various commentators on Spinoza are considered, it is necessary to see exactly where this problem arises in the Ethics, and the way in which it influences the divers problems Spinoza faces. The first twenty-seven propositions of the Ethics develop a bifurcation of reality into Substance, which is causa sui and whose nature entails its existence, and Modes, which are entirely dependent on Substance as the cause of their being and activity. Nowhere in these propositions do we find mention of finite modes.7 5 A criterion of knowledge going back to Aristotle. Cf., Posterior Analytics 1.2, 71b9-14, and Metaphysics A.1, 981a30-b6. 6 A notable exception is H.A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of Spinoza, 2 Vols., Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1934, pp. 202-203. He in fact notes the precedent set for Spinoza by Aristotle's identification of formal and efficient cause (e.g. Physics II. 7, 198a25-27). In Aristotle's case, the point is rather different, however. He is arguing that the efficient cause of a natural thing is the same in form as its effect, not that the essence of a thing is its own cause. Hence the verbal similarities in these two doctrines hide quite different points of view. 7 I must therefore take issue with M. Gueroult's suggestion that one may sum up the first sixteen propositions by stating that, "Dieu produit necessairement une infinite infinie de modes (Prop. 16), les uns infinis, les autres finis." (Spinoza, Vol. 482</page><page sequence="5">Causation in Spinoza A reader could easily conclude from the conclusions of E1P21 and 23 that all modes are infinite.8 It is important that the notion of finite modes is introduced along with the serial theory of causality in E1P28. This at least suggests that there is some sort of logical relationship between these two concepts. Whatever is determined to existence and action is thus determined by God (E1P26,Corol.). But that which is finite and which has a determinate existence could not be produced by the absolute nature of any attribute of God, for whatever follows from the absolute nature of any attribute of God is infinite and eternal (E1P21). The finite and determinate must therefore follow from God, or from some attribute of God, in so far as the latter is considered to be affected by some mode, for besides Substance and mode nothing exists (E1AI,Definitions 3 &amp; 5). The dichotomy between causality through the absolute nature of God and through God as affected by some mode, first presented here, is implicit in what precedes it. Spinoza is always careful in the earlier propositions of Book I to state that whatever follows from the absolute nature of God must be infinite and eternal what he neglected to tell us is that there was any alternative to God's absolute nature. Now, at proposition 28, he is claiming that what is finite cannot follow from God's absolute nature a claim entirely consistent with the rest of the first book. Nonetheless, Spinoza introduces finite entities into his system, and as God is the sole cause of everything's existence and behaviour, he must in some sense cause these to exist and act. Thus is born the notion of God as an infinite series of finite modes, to account for the endurance and behaviour of each other. The inconsistency in the doctrine of causality presented in Ethics I can now be more precisely stated. This theory seems to claim that all things flow from the absolute nature of God and some things do not. To introduce a cause for these latter items does not in the least avoid the contradiction.9 /., Dieu, Aubier-montaigne, Paris, 1968, p. 307) In a similar vein, he assumes that Propositions 24-27 are concerned with finite modes (p.325) an assumption that must be read back into these propositions after the distinction between infinite and finite modes is drawn in Propostion 28. 8 Cf. Joachim, H.H., A Study of the Ethics of Spinoza, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1901, p. 76, and Gueroult (op.cit.), pp. 309-324. 9 The recognition of this prbblem is almost as old as the text of the Ethics. Spinoza calls attention to such a paradox in KV I. ii, (pp.64-65 of the Wild edition), and Leibniz raised it as an objection in the Theodicy (cf. Leibniz, Selections, ed. P. Wiener, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1951, p.497.). Joachim's critique of Spinoza, based on this contradiction, itself stems from the work of T. Camerer, Die Lehre Spinozas, Stuttgart, 1877. 483</page><page sequence="6">James C. Lennox The value of coming to grips with this difficulty is clear when one realizes to what extent the distinction between the emanative and serial models of causality controls every aspect of Spinoza's Ethics. In epistemology, ideas are finite modes under the attribute of Thought, and are thus accounted for in terms of their following from the absolute nature of God on the one hand, and from a series of other finite ideas on the other. That is, we are told both that an infinite number of ideas follow from the Idea Dei, and that God is a cause of individual ideas not in so far as He is infinite, but only in so far as He is modified by an infinite series of finite ideas (E2P4, E2P9). This distinction permeates the second book of the Ethics (cf. E2P34, and E2P38,Dem.). The consideration of ethical and psychological problems is no less affected by this dual approach. We read both that man's essence is a determinate expression of God's (E4P4) and that, The power by which individual things and consequently man preserve their being is the actual power of God or nature, not in so far as He is infinite, but in so far as it can be manifested by the actual essence of man. (E4P7) One might characterize book four as an attempt to reconcile the conflict between the power of emanative and serial determination. On the one hand, the individual's conatus is an expression of God's power, and thus seemingly limitless and yet, the individual is limited by the efforts of other finite modes to assert themselves. With regard to man, this duality in his nature has obvious ethical, and even political, implications. The problem we are facing, then, is such a serious one because, far from seeing these two accounts of God's causality of finite modes as incompatible, Spinoza makes persistent use of the distinction between them, as if it solved difficulties rather than created them. III. The first analysis of the problem I shall consider is that offered by H.H. Joachim. Prof. Joachim considered himself an idealist10, a fact 10 By this term I intend a metaphysical theory which holds (in the words of a commentator on Bradley) "that the world regarded as made up of discrete objects is self-contradictory and, therefore, a world of appearances. The real is one, a world in which there are no separate objects and in which all differences disappear." From Masterpieces of World Philosophy in Summary Form, ed. F.N. Magill, New York, Harper and Row, 1961, p. 707. 484</page><page sequence="7">Causation in Spinoza to be remembered in considering his treatment of Spinoza's philosophy. However, it is wrong to think that he presents Spinoza as one. On the contrary, he argues that Spinoza's most serious difficulties arise from his failing to distinguish, along the lines of Bradley, between appearance and reality.11 On this view, Spinoza has not followed out the implications of his system. The logic of that system has as its major premise that all things flow from infinite substance, and must therefore be infinite and eternal. Finite modes, argues Joachim, can only be 'appearance', while Substance constitutes reality. It is an illusion to suppose that things are in any sense deprived of what they might have possessed. ...to the ultimate apprehension, there are no things, but one all-complete reality.12 Joachim thus treats the emanative theory of God's causality as Spinoza's correct theory, and the serial model as a failure on his part to realize that finite modes and their interactions are illusory.13 ...the modal apprehension of Reality is (at least in part) illusory, and. ..Spinoza attempts no explanation of the fact of the illusion...14 While there is more truth in Joachim's viewpoint than is sometimes allowed, I believe his critique fails precisely because Spinoza realizes that finite modes cannot follow from infinite Substance. It is because he knows this that the serial model of God's causality is introduced. Far from not seeing the logic of Joachim's critique, he introduces serial causation to avoid it. IV. Among current commentators on Spinoza, A.J. Watt and E.M. Curley have specifically drawn attention to the contrast between these two accounts of causality, and have attempted to render them 11 Cf. Joachim, p. 101, note 1. 12 Ibid., pp.111 and 114. 13 Watt, op.cit., p. 172, fails to note that Joachim is criticising Spinoza here, not interpreting him. 14 Joachim, op.cit., pp. 113-114. 485</page><page sequence="8">James G. Lennox compatible.15 Their arguments concerning the causes of the existence of finite modes are quite similar, but Watt diverges from Curley in suggesting that Spinoza offers a separate theory to account for the essences of finite modes.16 I will therefore concentrate on Curley's account first (noting Watt's agreement), and go on to consider Watt's alternative account of finite essences next. Curley begins by deducing a good deal of evidence for the conclusion that by the identification of God, nature and Substance "Spinoza is somehow identifying the power or essence of God or Nature with the scientific laws that govern phenomena."17 Borrowing from a more contemporary philosophy of science, he proposes, in order to elucidate his theory of causality,18 the application to Spinoza's metaphysics of a logico-metaphysical model, based on the logical atomism of Russell and the early Wittgenstein. The two aspects of this model match up as follows: Logic Metaphysics 1. Axioms (Primary Natural Laws) I. Basic Nomological Facts 2. Theorems (Derivative Natural Laws) 2. Derivative Nomological Fa&lt; 3. Accidental Generalizations 3. Accidental concurrences 4. Singular Propositions 4. Individual Facts The relationship which Curley sees between these two domains of the model is extremely simple. "Wherever there is a relation of 15 Watt, op.cit. (note 1.), Curley, E.M., Spinoza's Metaphysics: An Essay In Interpretation, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1969, chapter 2. 16 In taking this approach, his account follows that of M. Gueroult, although Watt seems unaware of this fact. Cf. Gueroult, op.cit., pp. 316-317 and 326-335. 17 Curley, p.49; cf. Watt, pp. 176-177. 18 Curley, p. 50. 486</page><page sequence="9">Causation in Spinoza logical dependance among propositions, there is a relation of causal dependance among the corresponding facts."19 To apply this model to Spinoza's metaphysics, one must argue that modes flow from Substance, in the way that conclusions follow from premises. But this would beg Joachim's critique if Substance is infinite and eternal, then just as one cannot derrive singular conclusions from universal premises, so it is impossible for finite modes to flow from infinite Substance.20 In attempting to solve this dilemma Curley and Watt part company from this point on, their proposals will be given separate attention. Curley's Proposal. Curley's claim is that the two aspects of Spinoza's theory of the causation of finite modes are separately necessary, but only jointly sufficient, to account for the determina- tion of finite mode's existence and activity.21 To make this suggestion plausible, Curley draws an analogy between Spinoza's theory of causality and the above model. Just as the deduction of a particular experimental conclusion requires both a universal law (or laws) and a specification of particular boundary conditions, so for the causation of a particular finite mode, both infinite Substance and the relevant series of finite modes are necessary only together are they sufficient to determine the being or activity of a finite mode.22 This interpretation, as plausible as it sounds, presents some serious difficulties. It postulates two sources of causality, each necessary, and jointly sufficient, for the determination of finite modes. Yet Spinoza is perfectly clear that the essence of God is necessary and sufficient for the production of all things (E1P16-18), and that finite modes are determined to exist and act solely through the efficacy of a series of other such modes (E1P28, &amp; Dem.). That is, both the emanative and the serial models of causality seem to be, individually, sufficient accounts of the determination of finite modes. Further, Curley's account implies that Spinoza would be willing to refer to the attributes of Substance and to finite modes as causes 19 Curley, p. 54. 20 Cf. Watt's statement of the problem, op.cit., p. 180. 21 Watt follows this account only for the existence of finite modes; ibid., pp. 176- 177. 22 Curley, p. 69; cf. Watt, p. 177. 487</page><page sequence="10">James C. Lennox even though neither of them is by itself causally efficacious. Yet from the sketch of his views on causation given earlier, it is clear that Spinoza would not consider a mere necessary condition a cause.23 For these reasons, Curley's proposed solution to the difficulty before us does not seem adequate. Watt's Proposal. Watt suggests that answering to the two accounts of God's causality found in the Ethics are two different effects of that causality; the emanative aspect of God's causality determines the essences of finite modes, while his serial aspect determines their temporal existence (i.e., their duration). With regard to the latter effect Watt's account is strikingly similar to Curley's however E1 P21-23 are taken to assert that the essences, and not the existence, of finite modes flow from God's infinite essence.24 Such essences are thus eternal, and logically prior to the existence of any mode with that essence a view which places Spinoza firmly in the Cartesian tradition.25 Watt is careful to note that Spinoza's definition of essence (E2DII) presents difficulties for his argument, and as I agree with this, I will begin with this definition. Watt interprets this definition as claiming that the essence of anything entails its existence, and vice-versa. Yet (as Watt points out) the distinction between Substance and mode, so basic to Spinoza's metaphysics, is obliterated by such a claim according to Ethics I only Substance possesses an essence which entails its existence (E1 P7 &amp; Schol. 2.), and it is in this that it is superior to mere modes. Faced with this paradoxical result, Watt assumes that Spinoza's definition of essence is either confused or erroneous, and feels justified in ignoring it. However, given the gravity of the error ascribed to Spinoza on this interpretation of E2DII, the possibility should at least be considered that it is Watt's reading of the definition that is in error. Before analysis of the contents of that definition is undertaken, it will prove useful to have in mind what Spinoza normally describes by the term. In the case of modes, it is clearly their conatus, that is, their 23 For the possible variations in the interpretation of causality in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, cf. T.A. Goudge's The Ascent of Life, University of Toronto Press, 1961, pp. 62-64. Like Curley, Goudge concludes that a mere necessary condition can be termed a cause. 24 Watt, p. 182. 25 Ibid., pp. 183-184. His vision of Spinoza thus falls within the Cartesian interpretation offered, for example, by Gueroult. 488</page><page sequence="11">Causation in Spinoza individual efforts after self-maintenance. The conatus or essence of each individual is, furthermore, a determinate expression of the essence of God (E1P25, E2P10,Corol., E3P8,Dem.) The definition given in Ethics II states, ...to the essence of anything pertains that, which being given, the thing itself is necessarily posited, and being taken away, the thing is necessarily taken; or, in other words, that, without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and which in its turn cannot be nor be conceived without the thing. (E2DII) This definition clearly states that a thing's essence is a necessary condition for its being. It seems also to claim that being the essence of something is a necessary condition for being an essence at all an essence "cannot be nor be conceived without the thing." To understand why this is so, and to understand this definition, it must be read in the light of E2P10. This proposition is a direct reply to Watt's misgivings. The Being of substance does not pertain to the essence of man, or, in other words, substance does not constitute the form of man. In the corollary he notes that man's essence (i.e. his conatus) is a determinate expression of the nature of God, and in a scholium that God is (a) that without which nothing can be nor be conceived and (b) the sole cause of the essence and existence of all things. Now, as (a) appears to be the definition of essence, he notes that some people make the following error. But many people say that that pertains to the essence of a thing without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and they therefore believe.. .that the nature of God belongs to the essence of created things. To correct this confusion, he goes on, I wish to give a reason why I did not say that that pertains to the essence of a thing without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and my reason is, that individual things cannot be nor be conceived without God, and yet God does not pertain to their essence. I have rather, therefore, said that the essence of a thing is necessarily that which being given, the thing is posited, and being taken away, the thing is taken away, or that without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and which in its turn cannot be nor be conceived without the thing. (E2P10,Schol. 2.) In this passage, either Spinoza has uttered a blatant contradiction, or he wishes to convey two different ideas by the phrase 'that without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived' by itself, and 'that without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived' with its converse conjoined to it. From what he has said prior to this statement, 489</page><page sequence="12">James G. Lennox the difference is this. Both a thing's essence and God are necessary for a thing to be or be conceived. However, God can both be and be conceived without things, while essences can only be and be conceived as the essences of some thing. Both facts no doubt follow from the idea that each essence is a determinate expression of the nature of God. Enough has been said to show that this definition does not suggest (as in the case of Substance) an identity between the essence and existence of individuals. Both flow from God, and "the duration of things cannot be determined by their essences, the essences of things involving no fixed or determined period of existence." (E4,Preface) It is clear that Spinoza saw no relationship of entailment between the essences and existence of finite modes, and there is nothing in the above definition to hint that he did. What it does say is that a mode and its essence are conjointly given and destroyed26 as we should suspect from the claim of E1P25 that God's essence (which is existence) is the cause of both, and from D2DI which argues that both are expressions of his nature. This analysis of the meaning of 'essence' in Spinoza also makes it clear that essences do not have some sort of being apart from the temporal existence of their modes essence is the effort of individual modes expended in existing, and a determinate expression of the power of Substance. For this reason, Watt's proposal for solving the dilemma of Spinoza's two theories of causality for finite modes must be rejected. There is one further difficulty in the way of acceptance of Watt's interpretation. His proposal must assume that the essences of modes, if they are infinite and eternal and flow directly from the nature of God, are (at least part of the time) possible existents. This not only contradicts the fact that the essences of finite modes are clearly said to be the active efforts of those modes in existing, but also implies that God possesses essences which can exist and yet do not He thus turns out to be that anthropomorphic creature of will and caprice of which Spinoza was openly scornful.27 An account of the dual nature of God's causality which takes into account the dynamic and active nature of essences is required, and will now be offered. 26 I owe recognition of the importance of this face to comments made by Prof. David Savan on an earlier draft of this paper. 27 See, for example, the scathing remarks at E1 P33,Schol. 2., and the Appendixes to Books One and Four. 490</page><page sequence="13">Causation in Spinoza V. In the following pages it will be suggested that the causality of finite modes in Spinoza's metaphysics can be understood by considering the infinite mode fades totius universi on the model of the biological unit of an eco-system.28 It will be further argued that, to capture Spinoza's concept of essence as the active effort expended by an individual in self-maintenance, the concept 'energy' can, for the purpose of interpretation, be substituted for the essence or conatus of in- dividuals.29 Since the essence of Substance is existence, this proposal has some radical implications for reading the Ethics, and in particular for understanding the nature of God's causality. Finally, it will be argued that to understand the causal activity of Substance, an ambiguity (which Spinoza is well aware of) in the meanings of 'existence' and 'essence' must be taken into account. Two of Spinoza's letters to von Tschirnhaus stress that his conception of Substance is radically different from that of Descartes.30 Because Descartes conceived of Thought and Extension as indepen- dent Substances, determined to activity by God,31 he considered them as static units, dependent on God for their activity. Spinoza, on the other hand, viewed them as attributes of an all-embracing Substance he could not look beyond them for the cause of their activity. 28 This model occurred to me while reading Prof. Harris' critical remarks on Watt's paper, "Comment", Canadian Journal of Philosophy, II, No. 2, 1972, pp. 191-197. 29 This manner of conceiving of Substance in Spinoza was stated first, and most clearly, by A. Wolf in his Aristotelian Society address of 1927 entitled, "Spinoza's Conception of the Attributes of Substance", reprinted in Studies in Spinoza: Critical and Interpretive Essays, ed., S. Paul Kashap, University of California Press, Los Angeles, 1972, pp. 16-27. Harris (ibid., p. 195) suggests that 'motion- and-rest' be interpreted as 'energy' however, he notes himself that Extension is a 'dynamic principle', and so I see no reason why the attributes themselves should not be interpreted as energy. 30 Cf. Ep. 80. 31 Watt (p. 179 and note 20) seems to think that Spinoza is here critical of the idea that God is the sole cause of all things but if this were the case, he would be criticising most of Ethics I. Rather, it is the notion that the will of God is a cause that he is criticising. 491</page><page sequence="14">James G. Lennox ...from extension as Descartes conceives it, that is, as quiescent mass, it is not only, as you say, difficult to prove the existence of bodies, but absolutely impossible. For matter at rest will continue at rest as much as possible, and will not be set in motion except by some stronger, external cause. (Ep.80) The deduction of the existence of bodies from a knowledge of extension requires, for reasons to be explained shortly, a material universe which is inherently active. Only when substance is conceived as dynamic will the attribute of extension be of such a nature that material bodies flow from its nature. Extension is, of course, an expression of the essence of substance (E1P19,Dem.), or of the 'energy' of substance (E3P7, E4, P4,Dem.). And since substance is such that is essence simply is existence (E1P20), it simply is power or energy, finding expression in an infinite number of ways.32 Spinoza mentions only two modes which flow either immediately or mediately from Extension motion-and-rest, and 'the face of the whole universe'.33 When the nature of substance is conceived of as energy, motion-and-rest is an obvious immediate infinite mode, precisely the material expression of God's power. It is modal, because motion must be understood through Extension, but it is an immediate and eternal consequence of God's expression of his power through matter. If one were to conceive of Extension as inert mass, on the other hand, it would remain a mystery why motion-and-rest would flow from the nature of substance. To understand why fades totius universi is a mediate yet necessary consequence of God's nature will be at once to see why the deduction of bodies from extension requires a dynamic conception of substance. For Spinoza asks that we conceive of the face cf the whole universe as a single individual (E2,Lem.VII, Schol.). I believe he does so in order that he can demonstrate that the fades totius universi flows necessarily from the infinite mode motion-and-rest. Why does conceiving the universe as one individual help us to understand that it is a product of motion-and-rest? To answer this question, it is necessary to recall that by an 'individual' Spinoza means a more or less complex system, defined by 32 This objection to Descartes' cosmology is well-echoed in Sir D'Arcy Thompson's remarkable On Growth and Form, Cambridge, 1917, pp. 14-15: "Matter as such produces nothing ... it can never act as matter alone, but only as the seat of .energy." 33 I am here limiting myself to the attribute of Extension both because Spinoza has more to say about the various levels of modality flowing from it, and because of limitations of space. 492</page><page sequence="15">Causation in Spinoza a formal relationship existing between the activities of its parts.34 Each of these parts, however, is itself an individual, i.e. a complex ratio of motion-and-rest and again these individuals are made up of sub- systems as well, and so on. One might say that Spinoza conceived of all individuals as organisms, entities defined in terms of a self-maintaining balance amongst the activities of their organs, this balance constituting their form or nature.35 If bodies are conceived of as systems of activities, clearly they can only flow from an attribute of substance that is dynamic, and this is the point of Spinoza's critique of Descartes in his letter to von Tchirnhaus. In asking us to conceive of the fades totius universi as a single individual a unified balance of activity aiming at self- maintenance Spinoza is in effect directing us to the notion of an 'eco-system' - that is, a biological unit defined in terms of a balance of activities among the sub-systems which make it up. Each sub-unit of such a system is, of course, itself defined by a balance of activities among its members, those activities in fact working so as to maintain the system. And each organism in each sub-unit is likewise a self- maintaining unit made up of parts in a harmonious balance of activity.36 Conceiving of Spinozistic individuals in this manner seems plausible in view of the fact that every mode of his system is more or less animate, i.e. has a psychic and a bodily aspect (E2P13,Schol.). A more concrete understanding of the concept of an individual's conatus is now possible. As has already been noted this term signifies a 34 E2P13,Lem. IV,Dem. Compare Sir D'Arcy Thompson's description of the unity of an organism during development. "Great as are the differences between rates of growth in different parts of an organism, the marvel is that the ratios between them are so nicely balanced as they actually are, and so capable, accordingly, of keeping for long periods of time the form of the growing organism all but unchanged." {op. cit., p. 60) 35 Cf . Jonas, H., "Spinoza and the Theory of Organism", ed., M. Grene, New York, Anchor Press, 1973, pp. 259-278. 36 This is not intended to be an accurate account of all the properties of an eco- system. I am obviously drawing attention to those properties which Spinoza finds most essential. Many assumptions implicit in what is here said are in fact false. The principles applicable on the level of systems of organisms are very different from those applicable to the organism as a system. (Cf. on this point G.C. Williams, Adaptation and Natural Selection, A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought, Princeton University Press, 1966.) The point here is that a Spinozistic ecologist would consider the same principles applicable to all levels, from the molecular to the cosmological. 493</page><page sequence="16">James G. Lennox finite mode's efforts toward self-maintenance. This effort is, in fact, the attempt to maintain the balance of energy which defines the individual. Spinoza is clear that it is not the bodies (parts) that make up a system that defines it it is the proper balance among the activities being maintained which does so, and this is its conatus or essence. To conceive of fades totius universi as a single individual is, then, to picture an infinitely large mode defined in terms of its maintenance of a balance among the activities of its parts, that is, among the infinite series of finite modes. It is thus clearly a consequence of the immediate infinite mode of Extension, motion-and-rest.37 Now notice that up until this point, a 'serial1 model of causality is unnecessary the entire universe and its activities are a direct consequence of the energy of eternal substance. Where does the notion of a finite mode enter into such a system? A possible answer to this question is given in Ep.32. ...all bodies are surrounded by others, and are mutually determined to exist and to act in a definite and determinate manner, while there is preserved in all together, that is, in the whole universe, the same proportion of motion and rest. Here again is Spinoza conceiving of individual finite modes as parts determined to exist and act so that the whole preserves that balance of motion-and-rest by which it is defined. Reverting to the 'eco-system' as a model once more is helpful. As Spinoza's system is the whole universe, an idealized eco-system must be imagined, one totally isolated from other systems and completely self-sufficient, existing in constant environmental conditions.Within this ideal system are many interlocking sub-systems. Such a system seems well adapted to serve as a model for Spinoza's cosmos as a result of an aspect of biological systems stressed first by L. von Bertalanffy. Organic systems operate outside the second law of thermodynamics.38 That is, they have various means of avoiding the tendency to dis-organization (entropy) which that law holds to be a characteristic of all physical systems.39 Biological systems tend to maintain the greatest degree of organization possible, and to increase in organizational complexity through time. In our 37 Cf. Ep. 12, and Gueroult, Appendix 9, pp. 502-509. 38 Von Bertalanffy, L, Problems of Life, New York, 1932. For a clear discussion of this issue, see A.L. Lehninger, Bioenergetics, 2nd. edition, California, W.A. Benjamin, Inc., 1971, pp. 23-28. 39 As a number of writers have noted, however, if a biological system be considered as an aspect of its environment, then the second law of thermodynamics holds, for such systems are bound to increase the degree or 494</page><page sequence="17">Causation in Spinoza idealized eco-system this means life will be maintained at a maximum, even though individual organisms will develop and pass away. One can take two points of view to such a system. The birth of a fawn is determined by its parents40, which in its turn devours a certain amount of foliage, affecting sub-systems of insects and flora, and which is finally devoured by a predator. The necessary and sufficient condition of each of these occurences is the existence and activity of other individuals in the system. However, the ecologist, trained to approach the eco-system as a single unit and to treat the sequence of activities described above as aspects of that unit, sees them as a constant and natural manifestation of the constant flow of energy which is maintained in that system. To apply this model to Spinoza's metaphysics, consider the fades totius universi as analogous to an infinitely large eco-system. If one considers this system from the point of view of a number of individuals causally interacting with one another, one is taking a sort of field naturalist's view of the system. However, considered as a unit, this same system can be viewed ecologically, that is as a harmonious balance of activity flowing from the absolute nature of substance. The further implications of this model cannot be appreciated until an ambiguity in Spinoza's concept of 'existence' (in application to modes) is examined. In the scholium to E2P45 Spinoza distinguishes the existence of modes as their duration from their existence as in Cod. He explains: I speak of the existence itself of individual things in so far as they are in God. For although each individual thing is determined by another individual thing to exist in a certain way, the force nevertheless by which each thing perserveres in its existence follows from the eternal necessity of the nature of God. The 'force by which each thing perseveres in existence' is Spinoza's definition of conatus or individual essence. Each individual has, so to speak, an existential force in so far as it is an expression of God's essence, which is existence. This existential force is its essence, which suggests that, in so far as individual's are viewed as aspects of God's nature, existence and essence are one and the same thing.41 rate of entropy in their environment. (On this point, cf. Goudge, op.cit., p. 173 and Lehninger, op.cit., p. 27) This interpretation is not, however, applicable to the idealized system we are here considering, for it can hardly be viewed as an aspect of a larger system. 40 Cf. EIP17, Schol. 41 Cf. Gueroult, op.cit., p. 334: "Mais precisement, ce que Spinoza a demontre dans le Corollaire de la Proposition 24, c'est qu'on ne peut soutenir que Dieu est la cause par quoi les choses perseverent dans leur existence, sans devoir accorder aussitot qu'il est la cause de leur essence../' 495</page><page sequence="18">James G. Lennox There is, however, another concept of existence in this passage - -each individual is determined to exist in a certain way by another individual thing. To understand the difference between these two notions of existence, Ep. 12 is (as it is so often) crucial. Substance and mode are there distinguished by noting that, ...by means of Duration we can only explain the existence of modes, but we can only explain the existence of Substance by means of Eternity, that is, the infinite enjoyment of existence or (in awkward Latin) essendi. The existence of a mode, then, can be explained in terms of its temporal duration. To exist is to endure, to pass away is to fail to endure. Spinoza goes on to say, however, that to understand a mode by means of noting its endurance is to comprehend it "...abstracted from the mode whereby it flows from eternal things." Presumably Spinoza means abstracted from the mediate infinite mode fades totius universi with regard to Extension to measure its existence by the clock is to forget that it is merely a part of a greater whole. Spinoza thus concludes, certain things are infinite in their own nature, and can in no wise be conceived as finite; ...some, however, are so in virtue of the cause on which they depend, yet when they are considered abstractly, they can be divided into parts and viewed as finite.42 The only plausible way of sorting out the elements of Spinoza metaphysics into these two categories is to see Substance and its attributes as 'infinite in their own nature' and Modes as infinite in virtue of their cause, yet finite when considered abstractly. For example, fades totius universi is infinite in view of the fact that it emanates from God's nature, but if viewed in abstraction from God as its cause by the imagination, the unity of the whole escapes us; all we see are a series of finite individuals interacting with each other. When attempting to grasp this distinction, remember that in considering the fades totius universi as an individual, what is important is its maintenance of a constant balance of motion and rest, not the endurance of a particular part. The parts may individually come and go, as the cells of my body do, without the identity of the whole being affected. Consideration of these passages leads one to the conclusion that Spinoza's universe is, as he so often tells us, simply one of Substance and Mode. The distinction between infinite and finite modes is an 42 Cf. E1P15,Schol. 4%</page><page sequence="19">Causation in Spinoza epistemological one that is, it depends on whether or not modes are conceived abstracted from their cause (in which case they appear as an infinite series of interacting finite individuals) or as in God, and thus infinite in virtue of their cause. There are two sorts of ways of conceiving the existence of modes, rather than two sorts of modes. This must also lead to the conclusion that the serial and emanative accounts of causality are not as the Watt and Curley theses supposed either singularly necessary and jointly sufficient accounts of one thing, nor causal accounts of two different things. They are the typical accounts one gives depending on whether one takes an abstract or unified view of modal existence. To get some sort of concrete idea of what this means in terms of understanding the universe as Spinoza wished it to be understood, let us now draw out the rest of the implications present in the ecological model sketched earlier. The field naturalist, it will be recalled, operated in his understanding of a given biological area with a serial model of causation. The organisms in this area do not appear to him to make up a system they come into being, develop and die solely in virtue of their interactions with other organisms. In Spinoza's terminology, they are viewed in abstraction from the mode whereby they flow from eternal things. The ecologist, however, considers these organisms as parts of a system, a unit: our ideal eco-system is a unitary expression of life, defined not by the parts which make it up but by the constant balance of activity which is its essence. Because of this difference in view-point, the death of an individual organism in the wild is viewed with anthropomorphic horror by someone untrained in ecology. An ecologist views such deaths as necessary if the proper balance of activity within a system is to be maintained. Likewise, Spinozistic determinism the grasping of every individual as an aspect of one unitary nature renders the evaluation of individual actions or misfortunes quite meaningless, in the conventional sense of evaluation. It is often supposed that the serial model of causation is injected into Spinoza's metaphysical system to facilitate another distinction, that between natura naturans and natura naturata, expressions which Spinoza explains in a letter to De Vries denote creat/ngand created nature respectively.43 Yet, in view of the fact that Spinoza tells us in the scholium to E1P29 that natura naturata is understood when we see that 43 The entire debate between Watt and Harris, and Curley's discussion, depend on the acceptance of this conclusion. In this regard, it seems to me that Joachim's analysis is a truer guide to Spinoza than that of his detractors. 497</page><page sequence="20">James C. Lennox all things are in God and caused by Him, this supposition cannot be correct. To see modes as in God is, as we have seen, quite the opposite to viewing them abstractly as caused by a series of finite modes. This conclusion is confirmed when one understands that the serial model of causality is implicit in Spinoza's account of the communis ordo natura, the common order of nature. The duration of our body does not depend on its essence, nor upon the absolute nature of God, but the body is determined to existence and action by causes which also are determined by others to existence and action. . .ad inf initum. The duration, therefore, of our body depends upon the common order of nature and the constitution of things. (E2P30) It is obvious here that the phrase 'communis ordo natura7 is Spinoza's characterization of serial causation, and it is here (and again at E2P31, Dem.) said to determine the durational existence of finite modes. Out of context, this sounds as if Spinoza is introducing yet another ontological category to contend with. This would, of course, refute my suggestion that the distinction between emanative and serial causality is epistemological. A consideration of the meaning of communis ordo natura, however, reinforces the interpretation I am here suggesting. In the corollary and scholium to E2P29 Spinoza stresses that this is the way the universe appears to those who perceive it passively, which perception gives us a "confused and mutilated" knowledge of things. The common order of nature is, in fact, nature understood abstractly, as merely an infinite series of interacting individuals. To such a world view Spinoza replies, ...those who think Extended Substance consists of parts, or bodies really distinct from one another, are talking foolishly, not to say madly. (Ep.12) Spinoza elsewhere offers us a rare example to express the point he is here making. ...we conceive water as being divided in so far as it is water, and that its parts are separate from one another; but in so far as it is corporeal substance, we cannot thus conceive it... . Moreover, water, in so far as it is water, is originated and destroyed, but in so far as it is substance it neither originated or destroyed. (E1P15,Schol.) Earlier I stated that I thought there to be more truth to the views of H.H. Joachim than is sometimes allowed. It must now seem to the reader that the current argument leads directly back to Joachim's critique of Spinoza. Are we not now seeing exactly how the alleged existence of finite modes is a mere illusion? If so, the serial aspect of 498</page><page sequence="21">Causation in Spinoza God's causality is mere appearance, and Spinoza has apparently missed this implication of what he is saying. I believe that this conclusion is a rush to the opposite extreme of the Curley/Watt model, and that there is, in this case, a reasonable middle ground. Joachim's thesis is based on the assumption that, because there is a basic unity in nature underlying the procession of finite individuals we see, the perception of this procession is an illusion. Yet (and Joachim admits this) all Spinoza says is that such knowledge is abstract, in the way noted above, and hence confused. To see the error in Joachim's assumption, let us apply it to a simpler example than Spinoza's metaphysics. For the moment, let us assume that the basic distinction between my awareness of the world and a pigeon's is my ability to form concepts, i.e., to subsume the indefinite number of entities I perceive under a limited number of classes, and the lack of such an ability in pigeons.The world I live in is in some sense less confusing for this fact, because it is populated by a finite set of classes, rather than a potentially infinite series of particulars unrelated in any manner.44 Joachim would apparently insist that the world perceived by the pigeon is illusory, not merely confusing. But it is the same world that I perceive, and not illusory at all. The pigeon is aware of the same entities as I, though my awareness is more adequate due to my seeing the interrelationships, that is the underlying unity, in that world. Spinoza offers an analogy in a letter to Jarig Gelles (Ep. 40) to explain the inadequacy of understanding nature in its 'common order'. Assume, he asks, that one encounters an ignorant man with a book full of wise thoughts. If you ask after the origin of the book, you are not satisfied by being told that this man copied it from another, who in turn copied it from another man, and so on, ad infinitum. For I am asking him not only about the form and arrangement of the letters, about which alone he answers me, but also about the thoughts and meanings which their arrangement expresses, and this he does not answer by thus going on to infinity. Presumably, we are to conceive of a single copy of this book as analogous to a finite mode, and the infinite series of copyings as the common order of nature, serial causality. To truly grasp each mode, then, it is useless to know the serial causes that lead up to it, and determine its temporal duration. When one sees each such mode as an 44 I am not implying that Spinoza would claim that such knowledge, based as it is on 'common notions', is ideal. My example is not intended to explicate Spinoza's epistemology, but to point up Joachim's conceptual error. 499</page><page sequence="22">James G. Lennox expression of Nature's eternal activity, when one understands its conatus, then, and only then, does one understand such a mode just as each copy of the above series of books expresses the same thoughts, and is only understood when the thoughts expressed are understood.45 This interpretation of Spinoza's theory of causality seems to be of value for a number of reasons. First, it avoids the dualism of the Curley and Watt accounts, on the one hand, and Joachim's critique on the other that is, one takes the distinction between emanative and serial causation as ultimately an epistemological one, without supposing that the serial model describes an illusion. Related to this point, Spinoza can be understood without making him Positivist or Hegelian, a tactic which I think can and must be avoided in historical interpretation. Second, Spinoza's identification of conatus and essence is taken into account, and is seen to play a major role in his theory of causality. Finally, Spinoza's place in the context of the philosophic traditions around him should be clearer. The concepts of essence and existence, for example, were radically opposed by the scholastic tradition of which Descartes was in many ways heir, while Spinoza identif iesthem in God, and unites them in individuals, whoseessences are their efforts in existing. The opposition between 'rationalism' and 'empiricism', while enlightening in comparing Descartes and Bacon, or Leibniz and Locke, is more difficult to apply to Spinoza. While he does ultimately accept the view that true knowledge is rational intuition of a 'concrete universal' (God, Nature, or Substance), he rejects the view that imagination (perceptually grounded knowledge) is deceptive or illusory. Such knowledge, while admittedly abstract and without context, is the starting point in the attempt to understand modes properly, that is in so far as they are Substantial, or expressions of Nature's infinite power.46 July 1975 45 To complete the analogy, if the series of books were infinite, the thought expressed through each copy would be one and eternal, even though its individual expressions would decay. 46 The comments of many people have played a role in this paper's evolution, but in particular I should like to note the comments of Profs. David Savan and R.F. McRae directed to earlier drafts, which have especially added to its 'survival value'. 500</page></plain_text>
