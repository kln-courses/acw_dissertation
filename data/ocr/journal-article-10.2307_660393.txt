FLOM THE figures that appear incised on stones in ancient Irish cairns seem to be regarded by archaeologists at present as mainly or wholly ornamental in purpose. Of those at Sliabh- na-Calliaghe, Loughcrew, near Oldcastle, County Meath, Wil- liam Frazer says in the introduction to his account of them: "It appears to me useless to attempt any satisfactory explanation of these hidden meanings, if such there be, in the present state of our knowledge, and it is preferable to regard them as decorative or ornamental tracings."2 A similar view was expressed for those at New Grange and Dowth, near Drogheda, County Meath, by George Coffey in the publication of his investigation of these in 1890.3 Referring to a suggestion by W. Wilde that they may be "ideographical or hierographic, in the strict sense of the word, that is sacred carvings," and quoting words from Sir R. C. Hoar on their similarity to the ornaments on ancient British urns of the tumuli of Wiltshire, Coffey says: "I have held the opinion for some time that the conditions of the scribings at New Grange are fully satisfied by those of ornament. That in fact these mark- ings simply represent the style of decoration of the Deriod and 1 Published in Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Vol. XXVII, 1892-1893. The illustrations are from ground-plans and water-color sketches by G. V. du Noyer of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

Romilly Allen held a similar view concerning the sculptures at New Grange, but considered those at Dowth and Loughcrew to be of mixed character, orna- mental and symbolic, for of these he says in his Celtic Art, p. 54: "The designs seem to be more symbolical than ornamental, and from the frequent occurrence of star-and-wheel-shaped designs may have to do with sun-worship." Commenting upon the stone sculpturing of the barrows Lord Avebury in his Prehistoric Times says: "with the exception of the fern-leaf all these archaeic sculp- turings in Great Britain are mere geometrical figures." This statement follows a brief account of those at New Grange and in County Meath. Speaking of cups, spirals, circles, and incomplete circles, among the carvings of England and Scotland he adds: "we have as yet no satisfactory clew to the meanings of these engravings.'" In view of the above quotation from Allen it is proper to add that Coffey had in 1892 noted some striking dif- ferences between the carvings at New Grange and those at Dowth and Loughcrew, principally the presence at Loughcrew of the cup-and-ring and at both Dowth and Loughcrew of the con- centric circles as an isolated figure. These are lacking at New Grange. Coffey has dealt with the subject twice since 1892; the last time in his work entitled New Grange and Other Incised 4 L.c., p. 22. Similarly, p. 49. 6 L.c., p. 61. Coffey recognizes a certain difference between the carvings of Dowth and those of New Grange; in the former "Some of the more definite forms present analogies to the Loughcrew carvings, and may possibly represent particular objects as in the case of the rock-pictures at Santa Barbara, California." But he believes, as in the case of New Grange, the chief motive of the carvings is decorative, and that, though possibly some few may represent familiar objects, now unrecognizable, no symbolical or religious meaning is hidden in them. 6 Referring to cup and ring markings, p. 23, Coffey says: "I believe in the tumuli of the Boyne and Loughcrew, we hold a loose end of that tangled skein." 7 Prehistoric Times. As Illustrated by Ancient Remains and the Manners and Cus- toms of Savages. By Lord Avebury. New York, 1913, pp. 172-173,</page><page sequence="3">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREW 141 Tumuli in Ireland, 1912. On p. 19 he cites his opinion from 1892, quoted above. The author allows that "some of the figures were in their origin symbolical"; but at New Grange these figures also are used with "constructive meanings," that is, that the figures have no meaning or purpose of their own, but only in relation to other figures, I assume the meaning to be; that the figures in question are not used in isolation with symbolic significance, but as part of a complex with ornamental purpose. Of the figures at Dowth one of the stones in the outside circle of boundary stones is pictured, and its four circular figures are regarded as suns (p. 55). Again on p. 77 it is noted that some of the figures have a scribbled appearance, among which are noted certain "sun-signs.' How- ever, "The wheel and other figures are finely scored; they seem to have some reference to sun-marks. These circumstances make it doubtful to me whether all the chambers and markings were made at the same time, and we must not forget that annual festivals were held at Dowth, and that probably the chambers may have been entered at various times." It may be noted in this connec- tion that according to the Annals of Ulster for 862 the tumulus at Dowth was entered and plundered by the Danes in that year; but possibly the survival of a tradition attached to the tumulus, and testified to by the religious festivals annually held there, may be of greater significance for our understanding some of the sculp- tured signs there than is the plundering, though it is within the range of possibility that the "scribbled" signs may have been added then. Finally as to Loughcrew the sculptures are interpreted in the main as ornaments, but now with some reservations, as on p. 89: "Evidence of the solar cult is abundant at Loughcrew." As such are named the equilateral cross and the cup-and-circle. Two subsequent contributions remain to be noted. In a study entitled "Une Nouvelle Interpretation des Gravures de New- Grange et de Gavr'inis," published in L'Anthropologie, 1912, pp. 30-52, Joseph Dechelette would add the Irish carvings to a series of west European sculptures of Neolithic age which are inter- preted as iconographic representations of the female human figure. The geographical distribution of figures thus interpreted, and first discussed in his Manual d'Archeologie, I, includes Asia Minor,</page><page sequence="4">142 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 Greece, Italy, Sardinia, the Iberian Peninsula, France, Great Britain, and Scandinavia, to which is now, then, added Ireland. With reference to New Grange I quote: "En presence de cet ensemble de faits, je croix qu'on ne peut hesiter a faire entrer dans la meme serie des masques humains schematiques certaines grav- ures de New-Grange reproduites-mais a mon avis, inexactement interpret~es-dans un nouveau memoire de M. Coffey" (p. 35). As Dechellette confines himself to New Grange I shall not cite his argument, except to note that he included among the schemati- ticised representations of the human face certain figures that also occur at Loughcrew, as the rayed circle, which I shall be obliged to discuss, below, from an entirely different view-point. It is to be noted, however, that Dechellette accepts and insists upon a symbolic value for the figures, but that the original idea, the point of departure, is the female human figure, not zdomorphic deities or natural phenomena. Similar is the view of G. H. Luquet, L'Anthropologie, 1913, pp. 168-169. I finally note the fact that Dr. Eug. Stockis would seem to include certain groups of figures in Loughcrew and New Grange with those of Gavr'inis, Brittany, notably the concentric circles, for which he rejects all earlier explanations and offers an entirely new interpretation, namely that they are finger-print sculptures, representations in stone of the lines of the human hand and fingers, "Les Petroglyphes de Gavr'inis et leur Interpretation." L'Anthropologie, 1921, pp. 1-36. In all the above views the rock-carvings of Ireland separate themselves sharply, therefore, from the rock-tracings of the Scandinavian North, which scholars have in recent years come to regard as prevailingly, or possibly entirely, of symbolic origin. And it also sets them apart from similar monuments in Scotland and England; for it is, no doubt, the general view of scholars to-day that also these are mainly, or perhaps wholly, of religious meaning. Now there are undoubtedly very marked differences between the Irish and the Scandinavian material, entirely aside from the ziomorphic and anthropomorphic figures and the groups of ship figures, which characterize so markedly the rock-tracings of the North. But there are also a number of similar features, which can hardly have had entirely different purposes in the two cases.</page><page sequence="5">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREIV 143 I have before me the excellent drawings published by Mr. Frazer in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland for 1892-93. We have every confidence in the trustworthiness of these drawings, and in the care with which the details of the carvings have been reproduced.8 As I have examined these I have come to have a very definite feeling regarding those at Loughcrew that symbolic elements are present among their figures in considerable number, both as simple and as compound carvings. And that, therefore, these groups range themselves in this respect with the Scandinavian and the English-Scottish sculptures. An examination of especially the compound figures occurring among them leads me to the conviction that here, as in the North, we have the sun-symbol in certain characteristic primitive forms and in a considerable variety of developed forms.' And that, therefore, these carvings in the cairns of central Ireland offer unmistakable evidence of a well-developed sun-cult as the central element in the religious worship of the-time. I believe this can be shown. It is the purpose of this study to consider briefly those at Loughcrew from this point of view. I shall quote first Wm. Frazer's description of the general situation of the cairns: "To the northwest of County Meath, about two miles distant from the town of Oldcastle, on the estate of Mr. Napper, Loughcrew, are a small range of hills, extending about two miles east and west, of which the highest ridge, called Carne Bane or Sliabh-Na-Calliaghe, rises 904 feet above sea- level, the surrounding country averaging about 300 feet. Being the highest eminence in Meath it affords an extensive prospect over widespread limestone plains stretching south and west across the center of Ireland, and the lower Silurian grits and slaty rocks that extend northwards round Lough Ramor, the ridge constitut- ing the line of junction of these two systems of rock. On a clear 8 See also Frazer's account of them, i.c., pp. 296-297. 9 In a monograph entitled: "South Scandinavian Rock-Tracings. A Survey of the Material, with Four Plates and a Bibliography, and Brief Account of Similar Sculptures in England and Scotland. With Two Plates"; published as Vol. VII, number I, of Scandinavian Studies and Notes, 1921, I have, on plates 3 and 4, indicated something of this variety in the rock-tracings. Confining myself there mainly to those connected with the cup and the wheel the two plates show more than 200 varieties.</page><page sequence="6">144 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 day the ranges of mountains above Carlingford on the east coast and near Sligo in the far west become visible from its summit, and it is stated that no less than eighteen out of the thirty-two counties of Ireland may be pointed out around the horizon."'o This situ- ation of this vast burial ground on the highest spot in the region (as near to the sun as possible), is paralleled in many other places in Great Britain and elsewhere by the situation of graves and holy places with undoubted evidences of sun-worship. It would be quite contrary to what we should expect if the numerous sculpturings here found should convey no message of such a worship in one form or another. There are at Loughcrew twenty-five cairns, of which ten now contain sculptured stones; of the remainder, one, Cairn D, seems never to have had any. Outside Cairn N there were four large stones, which mark an avenue sixteen yards long, pointing east; one of these stones had forty-eight cup-hollows inscribed on it. Further a stone connected with Cairn O showed twenty-eight cups. The stones of the remaining twelve cairns have been partly or wholly removed, so that it cannot be said whether they con- tained figured stones or not. Of those cairns that remain more or less intact, and which contain the figured stones, the roofing flags are often removed. In a few cases remaining roof-stones (stone s of cairn L, and stone o, o, of cairn T), contain inscribed figures; but the great majority of the carvings are found on stones of the walls, the passages, or the entrances, of the cairns. There are exactly 100 such inscribed stones within the graves; further one stone with "depressed markings" lies in a near-by field, and another large stone, which stands in the open "thirteen feet from the circumference of the most perfect or northern circle," contains an elaborately carved wheel, partly surrounded by six smaller wheels. The cairns with incisings are designated F, H, I, J, L, S, T, U, V, W, while the stone near the northern circle is pictured as Fig. 76 in Frazer's illustrations. The several stones are lettered, a, b, c, etc., for each cairn. I shall refer to them in the same way. There are, as I estimate the number, fully 800 figures. The largest cairn, L, is forty-five yards across; this contains eighteen 10 L.c., p. 294.</page><page sequence="7">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREW 145 incised stones. The next largest cairn, T, is 38? yards in diameter; this has twenty-eight incised stones, which is the largest number in any one cairn. This cairn, T, is enclosed "in a circle of thirty- seven stones laid on edge, varying in length from six to twelve feet." Inside the retaining-wall, "apparently going round the entire base of this cairn, is a piled-up layer, rising from three to four feet in height and about two feet in thickness, of sparkling quartz, a rock, which, unless obtained from glacial boulders by the builders of the cairn, must have been brought from some locality upwards of fifty miles distant.""1 This feature is not without interest. The most elaborate configurations are those of Cairn T. Ass F'. wax K~ 40 Fig. 1.-Stone d, Cairn T. Many stones have but one or two figures, while several have fifty or more. The following facts are also to be noted: in the case of stones with few figures these are found scattered irregularly about the surface of the stone. There is not evidenced any effort at a definite arrangement. This is also nearly always the case with the surfaces containing a mass of incisings; the figures are irregu- larly placed, as if each were there for its own sake, without any p L.c., p. 320.</page><page sequence="8">146 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

If stones gU, hU, jU, cV, and cW, are to be judged as conscious efforts at artistic effect they must be pronounced crude indeed.'2 They are found, as on jU, by the side of the same figures that characterize the stones in the cairns at Loughcrew as a whole. In turning to the figures themselves I shall begin with a small group of variant forms of the sun-wheel, forms which we identify with similar ones in Scandinavian rock-tracings and other rock- sculpturings on the continent.

See below. As is well known the four-spoked wheel within a circle (the so-called "cross-wheel") is found a number of times among Northern tracings, as on the Krapperup Stone,'3 Skine, Sweden. It is elsewhere in Norwegian and Swedish tracings found in isolation and in a number of compound forms. I shall mention only that of Norra Trdtti- landa,14 Tanum, Bohuslan, Sweden, where it is placed between two anthropomorphic figures representing, it is not unlikely, a major and a minor deity.

S., 26, 1924 The Wheel of Eight Spokes. There are three examples of this: stones eU, hL, and zT. The first two are here shown as Figs. 3-4. The sun-wheel with a central ring appears as a separate figure several times on Scandinavian rock-tracings, as on the Kasen Stone, at Ryk, Tanum, Sweden, here combined with spirals, ships, humans with upraised hands, etc.'5 The commoner form of four spokes and central ring appears four times on the same rock. In the example on stone hL the spoke-lines do not all meet the enclosing circle, and may not be intended to do so, in which case the figure is to be grouped with others to be spoken of below. The Wheel Without Spokes. This is found a number of times at Loughcrew, especially in cairns L and T. It is seen as a single ring with no other figure on the edge of one stone in L, but it is generally found associated with the cup, the wheel, the spiral, etc., as on mL and dT. The simple wheel of one circle is found about twenty-five times at Loughcrew. Usually, however, it takes the form of a series of concentric rings; it may then be of two rings (II, bL, mL, fU). On stone hi the outer ring is made up of a succession of dots and very short lines, here Fig. 6. See below under Cups. At Loughcrew concentric rings of few rings are not often seen (however, one of three rings, cL, one of four, jU). The characteristic thing here is the large figure of six or ten or twelve concentric rings. Thus the complexes of the chamber of cairn L show a mass of such figures with a large one of nine concentric circles around a central cup, forming the middle of the whole complex. And for the most part the large figure of concentric rings is not cut complete; ordinarily what we have is the upper or the lower half, though the figure may also be placed on the side, as it were. On the Hag's Chair the open side is down, similarly one of twelve concentric curved lines on o, o, T. The symbol takes this form especially often on the stones of cairn T, where we even find them combined into a figure of three such sections of large groups of curved lines. The sections of concentric circles no doubt symbolize the radiant sun, whereas the body of concentric circles is of more general meaning, i.e. without emphasis upon the sun's radiance. 15 Almgren, 1.c., p. 550. At Hvitlycke it forms the body of anthropomorphic figures.</page><page sequence="11">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREW 149 The Spiral. In the sculpturings at Loughcrew figures are often seen in which a circle complex passes into a spiral or vice versa. The pure spiral as a separate figure does occur, as one of four turns on stone gI and the large one of six turns on stone dT (here Fig. 1). Others are seen on stones IL and hU, and an especially fine one on stone aH. On this same stone are seen two large spiral figures at the left, cut around a central cupped ring. It is to be noted that in these cases the initial stroke of the spiral does not proceed from the ring but the spiral is wholly detached from it. On the other hand on the Hag's Chair, Cairn T, a spiral is changed at the second turn into a ring and enclosed in a ring; again on bU a small ring is enclosed in a single spiral. On stone fl two groups of concentric rings are by means of spiral lines joined into a figure, shown here as Fig. 11. Figures 13 and 14 represent spiral forms occurring on stones gI and iL. Finally the large top figure seen on Fig. 31 of Frazer's illustrations repre- sents a still more elaborate ring-and-spiral combination. Flexed and Open Concentric Rings. These forms of the sun- wheel symbol, so characteristic of English-Scottish sculpturings16 and several times met with in the rock-tracings of Norway, are also seen at Loughcrew. Cf. also above, under sectional con- centric rings, or concentric curves. Two or more rings are left open and flexed outward, or not flexed and then perhaps enclosed in a circle. These simplest forms occur once each, fU and iL; the latter exhibits a figure of six concentric rings, the central two being open, the outer two open at the left, but otherwise seen in the drawing as here Fig. 9. Of the various developments of this figure on English, Scottish, and Swedish, carvings two are found among those at Loughcrew, shown here as Figs. 15 and 16; they appear on stones in Cairn T. The former belongs to a type of the sun-disk symbol, an example of which occurs on the Tyrifjorden Stone,"7 Smaalenene, Norway, in the form here shown as Fig. 38. Cf. also above Fig. 9. The second of these figures represents one form of an extensive class with cupped ring, or concentric rings, 16 As at Ilkley, Yorkshire, England, and at Auchnabreach, Argyleshire, Scotland. 17 The part of this stone containing this figure is pictured in Aarsberetningfor 1902 of Foreningen til norske Fortidsmindesmaerkers Bevaring, p. 125.</page><page sequence="12">150 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [x. s., 26, 1924 and grooves running from the center to or beyond the enclosing circle. In its English form there is a central cup and usually a number of concentric rings. See Figures 47-51. Scottish forms are seen in Figures 52-54. The Scandinavian examples ordinarily have a cupped ring or a "cross-wheel." There may be one or several grooves, and even in the British figures these most often extend considerably beyond the circle. And in cases of a pair of grooves the sections of the concentric circles are seen between these and perhaps continuing between the grooves also outside the outer circle. It is the so-called "mirror emblem" and the "ladder ornament." Some of the Swedish forms are shown here as Figures 39-43; a Norwegian example from the L Oberg group, Gjerpen, is given as Fig. 36. In the North the principal develop- ment is in Bohuslin, Sweden, especially the District of Staingentis and a part of Tanum, where they are also present in connection with anthropomorphic representations of the sun-deity. An example of such a "mirror" from County Kerry, Ireland, is here given as Fig. 55j.s Of the Loughcrew figures that here given as Fig. 19 is found on stone bU, and that of Fig. 18 on stone dS. On the Irish figures, as also sometimes on English-Scottish ex- amples, the grooves, or handles, or arch, run only to the (outer) circle. Cf., therefore, Fig. 17, from stone al. An unusual form is seen in Fig. 20, from stone cU. Cupped Rings. Every cairn at Loughcrew exhibits cup-and- ring markings in one form or another. The general appearance of the "cup-and-ring" symbol among Norwegian-Swedish and English-Scottish Bronze Age sculpturings is well known. It is found in its simplest form, a cup within a ring, three times on the third Tuna Stone,19 S6rmland, Sweden; it is seen in many complex wheel-forms in the Gjerpen groups,20 Norway, in zbiomorphic and 18 Given as Fig. 11 on the illustrative plates accompanying a study by Charles Rau entitled "Observations on Cup-shaped and Other Lapidarian Sculpture in the Old World and in America," as Contributions to American Ethnology, Vol V. pp. 1-112.

In England the Ilkley sculptures,"2 Yorkshire, show a great variety of forms, as in Scotland, those of Argyleshire, and elsewhere. In Ireland they are found among the carvings of County Kerry, and also among those at Dowth. They are, however, not present in the sculptures of New Grange as William Frazer showed;22 this is one of several features that distinguished the latter from the figure groups at Loughcrew, and also from those at Dowth. Thirty-six of the eighty incised stones at Loughcrew exhibit cup-and-ring markings. Various forms are shown here as Figures 10, 26, and 30. Cf. also Figures 6, 25, 27, and 28. Stone eL seems to contain three very small cupped rings on a surface with eighty cup-depressions. No other type of figure appears. The usual thing is a cup and a single ring; sometimes the ring is replaced by a spiral. A cup in a number of concentric rings occurs several times. On stone dT and bV the central cup is very large, as often on Swedish tracings. The concentric rings are sometimes flattened out into an oval, even into pointed ends, as in Fig. 10, stone wT; otherwise this flattening appears inten- tional in only two other cases, kT and cU. Elsewhere tendencies toward this shape in many of the larger ring-and-spiral figures seem to be due merely to lack of skill, the inability to cut a true circle. The most elaborate combination of cup-and-rings at Loughcrew is one, here shown as Fig. 30, which appears on stone xT in a large complex of, mainly, cupped rings. Similar cupping of the spaces between the spokes is seen on Norwegian figures,23 as those at Fossum, Gjerpen, one of which is reproduced here as Fig. '34. A great variety of cup-, wheel-, and circle-figures occur among the rock-tracings of Smaalenene, Norway, and the districts of Kville,24 Tanum, and Stangends, in the Province of Bohuslan, Sweden. Fig. 35, shows one such from Nedre Hede, Kville. In 21 Illuzstrated Archzcologist, Vol. II, 1896, pp. 65-83, article by J.

On some exceedingly interesting groups of figures incised on rocks at Hjulatorp, Smaland, Sweden, discovered a few years ago,25 occurs one with a central ring in place of the cup. See Fig. 37. As the Loughcrew figure of this presents a special feature I shall consider it in another connection below. Ring or Wheel Formed With Cups. This form of the sun-wheel is characteristic of some groups among Scandinavian rock-tracings and they are now and then met with elsewhere. At Kinnekulle there is a ring formed with seven cup-depressions around a central cup, and also one of nine enclosing cups around a larger cup. The Hjulatorp Rock, Smaland, shows a ring of cups without any central depression, and the figure appears many times in Bohus- lMn. At Loughcrew a ring of five cups about a center of one cup is seen on stone yL, and on stone dT one of six cups; see here Fig. 1. Not quite round, but possibly intended for such a figure, are two groups of cups on stone bT. Cupped rings in pairs (or wheels in pairs) are sometimes observed in Scandinavia and Scot- land, and then in several forms: as a chariot, the so-called "spec- tacle-ornament," and in some form of a tree, leaf or flower-com- plex. The Doo Cave of East Wemyss, Fifeshire, Scotland, contains a remarkable example of the last.26 No clear instance of any of the three types of paired cup-and-ring figure is found among the Loughcrew groups, but pairs of other forms occur, as the two radiant rings on stone cI, and on stone xT, here shown as Fig. 23. The latter stone shows also two cup-and-ring groups combined above by a curved line over two cups. In this connecting element we have a form of the cup-and-ring symbol which is also present elsewhere in the Loughcrew carvings, as two cups in a ring or an oval. One such occurs immediately above the sun-wheel on stone aS, and one on stone eH. It is not clear what special conception may have attached to this as opposed to the single- cupped ring. We have considered so far certain well-recognized sun-symbols 25 Published in Fornvannen, 1909, pp. 187-194. 26 Illustrated Archaeologist, Vol. XI, p. 257, in one of a series of three articles on "The Sculptures Caves of East Wemyss," Vols. XI-XII, by John Patrick.</page><page sequence="15">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREW 153 and some special forms of these that occur on the carved stones of Loughcrew cairns. To these I add here one example of a different type of sun-symbol, which appears on stone cU, namely the ship. Its form is reproduced here as Fig. 32, and the whole figure complex in American Anthropologist for 1923, p. 389. Other figures of somewhat similar shape occur, but are rather uncertain; there can, however, be no doubt of this particular one. By way of comparison I may refer to a similar sun-ship among those of the Begby tracings in Smaalenene, Norway.27 There are many examples of ring, or wheel, or spiral, in bow or stern of ships on the rock-tracings, as well as of wheels or circles cut immediately above a ship. Unusual Forms of the Sun-Wheel. On stone aT there are two circles, joined one above the other, made by short slender trans- verse lines; see Fig. 21. One of the circles has a central cup. Stone hT shows a cup with a spiral around it, and also a cupped ring enclosed in a squarish figure. Stone bT shows a square figure, three of the ends exhibiting cup-hollows. Cf. the swastika; also may be compared the various ball-like stones with four or six round or flattish-round projections, such as that found in a grave at Ardkeiling, Strypes, Elginshire, Scotland, pictured in The Illustrated Archaeologist, III, p. 45, showing four projecting knobs with grooves between; or that found at East Braikie, Forfarshire, Scotland.28 A flower-like figure of three parts is seen on stone bI and a triangular figure of three rings on stone fU; with this compare such a triskele ball of three projecting knobs as that from Towie, Aberdeenshire, p. 26, Vol. XXX, Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. A figure of possibly a foot-sole, as often in Scandinavian sculptures and elsewhere, is seen a few times. The Rose-Figure. Among the elaborately carved stones of cairn T is one, stone o, the surface of which is occupied by a number of rose-figures, grouped irregularly around two cupped 27 Aarsberetning, 1902, 119. In Fig. 32, here, the right side is drawn a little too high. 28 The number of faces varies from three to fifteen; sometimes the faces are engraved.

Finally on stone jU several ring groups are formed into a rose. It is clear that the rose has a direct connection with the wheel, and that the rose itself is a sun-symbol. What is this connection and how did the rose- figure arise? The roseated figure with floriated disk is found a number of times on Scandinavian rock-tracings, and is there possibly in a measure of a different origin from that of the Lough- crew carvings. In the latter it seems to me the rose-figure is directly evolved out of the four-spoked and the eight-spoked wheel, more especially it would seem the latter. The doubling of the lines for spokes is often seen, as on the Fossum Slab, Gjerpen, Norway, where several of this type are present on the same surface. By eliminating the part of the circle between the double-stroked spokes we have the figure in question, as once on stone o, o, T. On stone oT (see above) the figure is found three times enclosed in a circle. Cf. Fig. 31 from stone aS. It is to be noted that the omission of the circle is a characteristic of the Loughcrew carvings. On stone xT we have a figure of four spokes with a cup between each; the outer ring is omitted. On stones al and el several such figures occur; one of four spokes made with double lines, without circle, but open ends, and another with closed ends. In Nor- wegian tracings the same figure is seen, but with the circle retained. The Symbol of the Radiant Sun. Of the considerable number of figures that belong here see again Fig. 30, already referred to above under cup-and-ring combinations. This wheel does not exhibit the central spoke ordinarily seen on Scandinavian rock- tracings, but cupped strokes between the two outer circles, and other strokes outside the circle, some of which have been effaced by weathering. Several of them are seen, however, as also the cup-hollows between them. Here we have another significant evidence of sun-worship on the part of those who made the 29 This stone has often been pictured, as in "Observations on Cup-shaped and Other Lapidarian Sculpture in the Old World and in America.

The figure belongs to a special type of representations of the sun-wheel, in which the incised bars or slender lines are not intended to stand for the spokes of the sun- wheel, but represent the rays of the sun itself. In figures of this class in Scandinavian tracings the emphasis is everywhere on the sun as a revolving wheel, or disk, or sphere, and where the spokes are shown they run outward from a central cup or ring. In some cases with several enclosing rings the spokes may run through to one or more of these. Or again four other spokes may run from the center to one of the outer circles, thus producing a figure of an eight-spoked wheel inside one of four spokes. In the tomb- carvings of Loughcrew the wheel plays an important r61le, as we have seen; but the emphasis is here not on the sun as a revolving constellation, but on the sun as a radiant sphere. And so its symbol becomes a ball, or a ring, and radiating lines. In Fig. 30, we have three concentric circles around a central cup, and cups and rays around the circumference of the outer circle, the whole figure being again enclosed in a ring, with radiating lines. It is important to note that the latter cannot be looked upon as part of the interior bars, viewed as spokes, for they are not cut as continuations of these, but proceed from points between the interior bars. The Loughcrew figure belongs with a group of wheel-symbols in which the center is a large ring, or two or more or concentric rings (with or without cup), and which is connected with an outer ring by radiating lines; the center of the figure may also be a wheel of (generally) four spokes, or more. The number of exterior lines representing the rays, is larger than that of the interior spokes; hence some of the exterior lines, or it may be all of them, occupy a position between the ends of the interior lines, not as continuations of them,-that is, they are not parts of the spokes; they are added strokes representing the rays of the sun. Fig. 45 of the head of a Danish bronze pin shows four rays between continuations of the four central spokes. Fig. 44, an Italian ornament, shows six rays between the inner circles and eight rays between the outer circles; in Fig. 56 we have a mass of rays about a central wheel.30 30 Copied here from Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie for 1904, p. 590.</page><page sequence="18">156 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [I. s., 26, 1924 Other Forms of the Symbol of the Radiant Sun. We have seen above that the sculpturings at Loughcrew exhibit in their sym- bolism an emphasis upon the rays of the sun, not so much on its movement or its roundness. This finds expression in a develop- ment of the circle or the cup-and-ring into forms with prominent radial lines for the sun's rays. There is first a very striking one where the sun is represented by a cup-depression with a number of rays projecting out from it, as Fig. 22, from stone cU. A similar one appears on stone jU. Or the center is a small ring, as here Fig. 24, from stone o, oT. Stone dV has, as the only figure, such a one, with the rays represented by short lines and dots (very small cups). In several instances there is no central cup or ring, as here Fig. 23. This figure corresponds to the simplest ones of the wheel, see Fig. 33, but with elimination of the circle.

See above p. 1I and Fig. 46. Ordinarily the figure takes one of the forms here shown as Figs. 27-29. In a few cases the rays are above, but in most occurrences of the symbol the rays are beneath. The former would seem to represent the setting sun (and the rising sun). See herewith Fig. 57 of Stone 1, Cairn L. The figure with the rays beneath shows sometimes heavy rays, numerous slanting rays, as on the upright stone in the open, where are seen two series of heavily cut rays forming an outer and an inner semi-circle, and between the rays and beneath the lower series other curved rows .........

He notes that the solar disc with rays proceeding downwards is a well-known Egyptian sign for solar energy, and suggests this meaning for the markings on the stone in question, adding: "At the same time it is difficult to escape from the impression that some scheme of association underlies the markings on some of the stones at Loughcrew, pertaining to religious myth or the life-stories of the persons who were buried there." Egyptian influence for the symbol here discussed need, of course, not be assumed.</page><page sequence="20">158 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 centrically with it, may occur; one such is found as the only figure on stonef of Cairn S. Compare the figure of two groups of concentric lines over a figure of curved lines spoken of above. Conclusion. The two conceptions of the sun which seem evi- denced in the Loughcrew symbols, the one as a light- and heat- giving power, the other as declining at the end of day and dis- appearing beneath the horizon followed by darkness, represent undoubtedly the points of departure of the belief in the twofold character of the sun. It will help to explain the dual cult, one to a god of fruitfulness and another to a death deity, of which Bronze Age rock-tracings and other sculpturings among Indo-European peoples seem well-nigh everywhere to give evidence. The Scan- dinavian rock-tracings seem certainly to reveal a sun-worship in a well-developed stage, with various cults, a nature worship with z6omorphic deities; and here and there we seem to witness the emergence of anthropomorphic gods. Of this the Loughcrew groups may represent the beginnings. The sun symbol mith descending rays represents the sun in the function of bestowing fruitfulness and life. The symbol with cupped circles and de- scending grooves in Scotland and England then may be an emblem of fertility in nature and in human life. At any rate it seems likely that sun-worship as evidenced at Loughcrew had a fertility cult as part of it. I note the fact that the form of the compound symbol of the radiant sun varies somewhat in the two types of cases. Where we have a figure with surrounding rays the center may be a cup, a ring, or a cupped ring; and in the figure with superior rays the center is a ring or concentric rings. On the other hand in ten of the twelve occurrences of the figure with descending rays the center is a cupped ring. Possibly then this cupped ring with descending rays is a symbol of the sun as a deity of fruitfulness. We may compare the symbol of Mahadeo (Siva), fertility deity of the Hindoos: a cupped double ring, or cupped concentric rings with a groove running from the center through the rings. And finally regarding the significance of the cup-hollows I call attention again to the fact that at Loughcrew the cup often replaces the ring in the simplest figures. The cup stands for</page><page sequence="21">FLOM] SUN-SYMBOLS AT LOUGHCREW 159 that which the ring stands for. The cup alone then is a sun- symbol. And so originally elsewhere perhaps.32 The cup or bowl antedates the wheel or the circle (and all other symbols) in the late Stone Age. Here as later it is regularly hemispherical in shape. No doubt our ancestors in the late Stone Age first con- ceived of the sun as a ball; and the half-sphere carvings in stone that they left were the earliest way in which they reproduced its likeness for their purpose.
