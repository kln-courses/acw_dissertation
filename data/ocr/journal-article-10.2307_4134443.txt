<plain_text><page sequence="1">New and Improved: Repetition as Originality in Italian Baroque Practice and Theory Maria H. Loh In her essay "The Originality of the Avant-Garde," Rosalind Krauss concluded with a brief discussion about Sherrie Le- vine's original photographs of reproductions of other artists' photographs (Fig. 1). Originality and repetition, Krauss ar- gued, could not exist without each other. The former was the basis for both the myth of the avant-garde and, in a somewhat ironic pairing, the authority of institutional bodies-that is, the museum, the historian, and the artist. The repression of repetition, moreover, was crucial for the perpetuation of its twin. Endless replication, from Auguste Rodin's multiple original bronze casts to Levine's deliberate repetitions, chal- lenged the modernist obsession with the originality of the avant-garde. In a similar move, Abigail Solomon-Godeau identified "se- riality and repetition, appropriation, intertextuality, simula- tion or pastiche" as the primary devices employed by post- modernist artists.2 More generally, Craig Owens subsumed these practices under the "allegorical impulse." The post- modern artist or allegorist, Owens suggested, appropriates, interprets, and confiscates images not to "restore an original meaning that may have been lost or obscured" but instead to add, replace, supplant, and supplement one meaning with another.3 This is evident, for instance, in Levine's photo- graphs after photographs, which are no longer about the objects photographed but instead about repetition as an essential aspect of the act of representation in and of itself. Commenting on her own work, Levine borrowed Roland Barthes's pronouncement on the death of the author; sub- stituting "painter" for "author," she suggested that "the viewer is the tablet on which all the quotations that make up a painting are inscribed without any of them being lost. A painting's meaning lies not in its origin, but in its destination. The birth of the viewer must be at the cost of the painter."' At bottom, there is a desire to subvert the institutionalization and commercialization of artistic production by denying unique authorship and objecthood to the work of art. Two epistemological transformations can be noted here. The first is the displacement of an antiquated and somewhat reaction- ary understanding of originality as an essential quality of the omnipotent, self-sufficient artistic genius as manifested in the unique object (the singular autograph painting, the autho- rized photograph, sculpture, and so on). The second is an alternative investment in a modified notion of the work of art as a context with its own intentions, in which the possibility of originality is continuously negotiated between the producer, the object, and the spectator with each new viewing experi- ence. Keeping these issues in mind, this essay will explore repe- tition as a critical strategy in both Baroque practice and theory." With the renewed interest in and quotation of Ve- netian Renaissance art at the beginning of the seicento, originality and repetition, as we shall see, were intimately bound to one another in the painting and artistic discourse of this period. Even though Krauss's essay has acquired its own mythic status, the myth of originality maintains its hold on art historical discourse, especially when it is concerned with a period, like the seventeenth century, populated by Geniuses and Great Masters. One often makes the assump- tion, for instance, that originality is an immanent category of judgment, but the term "originality" is itself an eighteenth- century invention.6 This is not to say that a concern with, an abiding interest in what we now call originality did not exist prior to its formulation as a word. In order to gain a better understanding of the historical context in which the term "originality" came into being, we must listen more closely to the discourse that brought it into existence and that it even- tually replaced. Repetition played an important role in the formulation of both Baroque practice and theory. Rather than a classic modernist axis of originality versus repetition, premodernist discourse addressed the question of artistic innovation within the limits of imitation and emulation. Sev- enteenth-century beholders articulated their reception of an aesthetic mode that embraced demonstrative repetition through its own historically bound terms, among which we will consider mixture (misto), wit (acutezza), novelty (novita), theft (furto), and pastiche (pasticcio). If Barthes and Levine speak about the birth of the reader/ viewer at the expense of the death of the author/painter, we can also entertain the prospect of a more fluid and less binary relationship between the two categories, for in all cases the author/painter is his or her own first reader/viewer, and in many cases, subsequent readers/viewers are also themselves authors/painters.7 This is the situation, in any case, for the specific group of Italian Baroque artists on whom we shall concentrate here. It may come as no surprise to art historians of the dubiously termed "early modern" that many postmod- ernist attitudes about artistic production and interpretation find a certain resonance in both the practice and theory of an earlier premodernist age; this may not, however, be so evi- dent to scholars of subsequent periods. When Julia Kristeva referred to the text as a "mosaic of citations, which absorbed and transformed its individual com- ponents," or when Barthes called it a "tissue of quotations" and a "multidimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash," or when Jacques Derrida described it as an archive of "always already transcrip- tions" (or the "always-already-read," according to Fredric Jameson), these authors were all drawing from a classical topos of eclectic imitation outlined by authors long before them.8 Predating postmodernism by over three hundred years, the Baroque theorist Secondo Lancellotti pointed out, "There are many books in one book, and many authors speak through the mouth of one author." Crediting Aristotle as his own point of reference, Lancellotti explained that this type of</page><page sequence="2">478 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 1 Sherrie Levine, After Walker Evans (no. 21), black-and-white photograph. Collection of the artist invention elicits a certain type of pleasure from us because "we feel great delight when we see two equal forces (or two forces between whom we are unable to detect too much difference) come together in competition."9 In spite of the historical and ideological differences that necessarily sepa- rate Lancellotti from Kristeva and the others, a useful paral- lelism can nevertheless be drawn from the postmodern ap- preciation of repetition and early modern theories of intertextuality. It goes without saying that imitation is an embedded prac- tice that can be traced in one form or another throughout the history of Western art. Although specific motivations and ends necessarily change, imitative practices remain essentially the same. In certain periods, artistic creation is said to be burdened by an "anxiety of influence."10 For generations of post-1789 artists, the urgency of establishing a new culture that disassociated itself from the past may have contributed to a very real anxiety of influence, but this was not always the case for Baroque practitioners and spectators. In this regard, because postmodern theory is sensitive to the creative possi- bilities of pastiche, appropriation, and repetition, it offers us an alternative way to appreciate seventeenth-century art, which is more generous and appropriate than the Romantic myth of artistic genius and the early modernist obsession with originality. If imitation is a general category of artistic activity, repeti- tion is an insistently demonstrative species of imitation. Rep- etition, to be more precise, is a particular type of imitative creation that intentionally glosses, appropriates, or recontex- tualizes previous works (as Levine does) and that builds into the logic of the work of art the moment of recognition of the repeated elements. Repetition cannot be compared, for in- stance, to forgery, which is a form of imitation that does not seek identification; the forger does not want the viewer to see the deception, whereas the artist of repetition does." Rather than pursuing originality in the utterly new and hitherto unseen and unheard, premodernist artists, as in the case of some of their postmodernist successors, enacted a certain type of originality that was located precisely in the imitation of great masters and in the competitive repetition of eternal tropes. It is both the production and articulation of this alternative aesthetic of repetition that concerns us. This is not to suggest that Baroque artists and theorists were unanimously receptive to an aesthetic of repetition, or that repetition was somehow the dominant mode of an over- generalized Baroque perception, rooted in a Baxandallian notion of a period eye. Against such an understanding, these remarks attend to the idea of a culturally and group-specific lens or, more appropriately (as we shall hear below), tele- scope. The recognition of pastiched materials in works of art appealed to a particular mode of aesthetic pleasure that coexisted with others at a given point in the past. If an artist like Federico Zuccaro accused Caravaggio of imitating Gior- gione, there were also other spectators, like Giovanni Pietro Bellori, who praised the Milanese artist for the same.'2 In some instances, repetition was perceived positively as wit and novelty and in other instances negatively as theft-although even theft could itself be considered a good thing when in the hands of an able thief. The focus of the argument that follows is precisely the fine line between praise and censure and the problematized distinction between originality and repetition in early-seventeenth-century practice and theory. A Tale of Two Cities: Venice, Rome, and Neo-Venetianism In 1614 a virtually unknown Venetian artist, Alessandro Varo- tari (b. 1588, Padua-d. 1649, Venice), who would later be known as Il Padovanino, arrived in Rome, where he copied Titian's Bacchanals in the palace of the Aldobrandini family (Figs. 2-4). On that occasion the twenty-six-year-old Pado- vanino also painted a fourth picture (Fig. 5), which was a proficient pastiche of works by Venetian, Roman, and Bo- lognese masters of the sixteenth and very early seventeenth century. Padovanino was not alone in copying the Baccha- nals. Many artists of diverse talent and for different moti- vations did the same. Giovanni Andrea Podesti dedicated his engraved copies to Cassiano dal Pozzo and Fabio della Corgna in order to gain influence with members of the Barberini papal circle. The Florentine painter Giovan Battista Vanni was paid 200 scudi for his copy of the Bacchanal of the Andrians." Peter Paul Rubens copied the two Titian paintings for the king of Spain.'4 Others made replicas as an aide-m~moire for future use. Domenichino made two drawings (now lost) of Titian's Bac- canaria, which he might have consulted as he painted his own Diana and the Nymphs (Fig. 23) for Cardinal Pietro Aldobran- dini, who in 1616 was the owner of Titian's Bacchanals.'" Nicolas Poussin and Francois Duquesnoy made sculpted cop- ies of Titian's Worship of Venus.16 This influence was not overlooked. Baroque spectators were quick to make the con-</page><page sequence="3">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 479 2 Padovanino (Alessandro Varotari), after Titian, Worship of Venus, oil on canvas, ca. 1614.

Bergamo, Accademia Carrara nection between the seventeenth-century artists and their Renaissance forefather: Orfeo Boselli compared the tender- ness of Duquesnoy's sculpted infants with Titian's; Andre Felibien and Gianlorenzo Bernini connected Poussin's style with Titian's.17 Anthony Van Dyck similarly transcribed the Andrians in his sketchbook (Fig. 6) and repeated many of these figures and compositions in paintings like Amarilli and Mirtillo (Fig. 7).18 As late as the second half of the seven- teenth century, the Neapolitan artist Luca Giordano likewise copied Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (Fig. 8) and immediately reused the figures in the numerous paintings after the same theme that he produced in the 1670s and 1680s (Figs. 9, 10). The painted copies made by Padovanino and the others after the Bacchanals are not demonstrative, creative, or com- petitive repetitions per se. They belong to another category of imitation that fulfills a documentary purpose in an age before cameras, photocopiers, and digital reproductions. The works like Domenichino's Diana or Van Dyck's Amarilli that resulted from these imitations, however, are proper rep- etitions. Padovanino's fourth painting certainly was. Marco Boschini, the most outspoken seventeenth-century champion of Venetian painting (and a good friend of Padovanino's family), effused in front of the four works. Titian's Baccha- nals, he wrote, "are three in total, but Padovanino of his own invention added a fourth, which is so beautiful and good and which, next to the others is a unique construction.... It is a fantastical invention, currency minted from the finest of metals." Roman virtuosi and artists, he continued, went to watch the young artist as he painted, and jealous rivals, who mistook the picture to be by Titian himself, were converted into admirers. There was such intelligence in his own inven- tion that in seeing this painting people were astonished.'9 Many of the details in the Triumph (Fig. 5) are paraphrastic repetitions from Titian's three Bacchanals. For instance, the tree that extends into the scene from the right-hand edge is transplanted from Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne. The ring of putti dancing in the top right corner against the shadow of the tree and the little winged putto crawling onto the plate on the left are kidnapped from the Worship of Venus. The ship in the background of Titian's Andrians has sailed into the background here. The bacchanalian crowd and luscious nudes are rented from the Andrians. The musculature and tonality of the men in the lower right-hand corner are rem- iniscent of the bearded figure in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (itself a quotation of the Laoco6n). At the same time, new actors discovered in Rome also perform on this cinquecento Venetian stage. Michelangelo's Sistine Adam (Fig. 11) carefully reclines in the lower left- hand corner of the Triumph. The merriment in Raphael's Farnesina Galatea (Fig. 12) is also at work in this Baroque production. The conch-blowing figure, for instance, has been hired for a similar role in Padovanino's party. The fluttering cape of the seated goddess in the Triumph is a hand-me-down from Annibale Carracci's Galatea in the Farnese Gallery (Fig. 13) or perhaps Guido Reni's airborne Aurora in the Casino Rospigliosi (Fig. 14). Although the two young recumbent women in the foreground are clearly inspired by a Ti- tianesque ideal, the immediate reference may have been</page><page sequence="5">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 481 5 Padovanino, Triumph, oil on canvas, ca. 1614. Bergamo, Accademia Carrara from one of Francesco Albani's many mythological and alle- gorical paintings of this period in which a similar grouping is used.20 Although the trio to the right seems to draw its inspira- tion from Tintoretto and Palma Giovane, it also points to certain religious images that Padovanino would have seen in Rome in 1614. The attenuated musculature is Titian- esque and classical, on the one hand, and thoroughly Ro- man and modern, on the other. The tension between the push and pull of the figures may have been influenced by dramatic post-Tridentine death scenes such as Caravag- gio's Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Fig. 15). The strangely bent leg of Padovanino's female victim appears like a disrobed revision of Annibale's triumphant Virgin in the Cerasi Chapel (Fig. 16). Annibale's was a highly unusual design in 1601, and one that did not go unnoticed by other artists. Domenichino, his own pupil, repeated the pose (in reverse) for an octagonal ceiling painting in S. Maria in Trastevere of the same subject fifteen years later (Fig. 17). One might suggest that Annibale's Cerasi Assumption sim- ilarly inspired Padovanino. The bizarre positioning of the woman's foot, which tries to gain purchase on the aggres- sor's back in the Triumph, resembles the Virgin's step on the putto's head in Annibale's Assumption. This is not to conclude that they are indisputably Padovanino's sources; instead, they give us an impression of the general visual vocabulary of a relatively well-informed early-seventeenth- century spectator. To modern eyes, Padovanino's Triumph may appear to be nothing more than an amusing cut-and-paste job.

"There are the copies in Venice," Boschini remarked, "of an admirable style and of elevated and celebrated virtue" that are "by the perfect and dignified hand of the Vice-Author (as he is called)."21 When Boschini refers to the "perfect and dignified hand of the Vice-Author," he simultaneously acknowledges Padovani- no's presence in the paintings and points to a certain amount</page><page sequence="7">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 483 8 Luca Giordano, after Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne, pencil and pen, 1665-70.

Chrysler, Jr., 71.650 of identifiable stylistic masquerading that was going on in the picture. In acknowledging Padovanino's agency as the "Vice- Author," Boschini categorically read the Triumph as a pas- tiche-or, one might venture, as a "mosaic of citations," a "tissue of quotations," a "multidimensional space," an archive of "always already transcriptions," the "always-already-read," and, as Lancellotti (Boschini and Padovanino's contempo- rary) would have said, books within a book.22 Mixed Metaphors and the Objects of Repetition Aside from Boschini's effusive if not deliberately provocative remarks, we have very little written record of what contem- porary viewers thought of Padovanino's Bacchanals. There are, however, plenty of comparanda. Creative or demonstrative repetition achieved through selective imitation was, as we saw with the various repetitions of the Bacchanals, a standard practice. The objects of imitation, meanwhile, were various. In some instances, an artist chose to imitate another artist's style (maniera); in other cases, similar themes (concetti) and even specific details (figure) were repeated. Several authors, for example, observed that Rubens consciously painted the altarpiece for the Oratorians in Rome in the style of Paolo Veronese. Bellori wrote that it was based on the "intentions [intentione]" of Veronese.23 Other Baroque art critics, such as Filippo Baldinucci and Roger de Piles, said it was in the style or "taste [gusto/gouste]" of Veronese.24 And still other paint-</page><page sequence="8">484 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 10 Giordano, Bacchus and Ariadne, oil on canvas, ca. 1675-77.

Vatican, Sistine Chapel ings by the Flemish master were seen as interpretations of Titian's "ideas [idea]."25 In other cases, different referential layers might be distin- guished. According to the seventeenth-century Bolognese biographer Carlo Cesare Malvasia, Reni painted a girl in "the taste [gusto] of Raphael," an older woman in the "taste of Correggio," a shepherd in the "taste of Titian," and a nude in the "taste of Michelangelo," all in the same fresco at S. Michele al Bosco.26 Seventeenth-century artists and works were not the only ones to be placed under this taxonomical gaze. Looking at Tintoretto's Assumption of the Virgin in the church of the Gesuiti, Boschini concluded that "all of the styles [maniere] are united here: there is Paolo Veronese, Titian, Schiavone, and Bassano.""27 Giulio Mancini, the Sienese art writer and papal doctor, referred to El Greco as "that Greek [artist] who operated in Titian's style [maniera]," which seems to suggest that, in the first decades of the seicento, some authors still considered Tintoretto's style (with which the Greek painter is more commonly aligned) as an extension of Titian's late style.28 The term "mixture" or "mix" (misto) was often used to describe stylistic repetition. In a letter to Bellori, Albani specified that his master, Annibale Carracci, successfully "combined into one style" the art of Correggio, Titian, Ra- phael, and Michelangelo, producing a perfect misto that ac- commodated the best quality of each individual artist.29 At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Pellegrino Antonio Orlandi would similarly use misto on numerous occasions to explain stylistic polyphony. He wrote, for instance, that Giulio Procaccini found his "own, true, and natural style" through a "Raphaelesque, Correggesque, Titianesque, and Carrac- cesque misto"; that Annibale's style consisted of a "great Cor- reggesque, Parmigianesque, and Titianesque misto"; that Lodovico Carracci added to his study of works by old masters a certain "Lombard misto"; that Cammillo Rama's paintings betrayed both the style of his master, Palma Giovane, and a "Tintoresque misto."30 Misto, therefore, articulated a model of repetition based on judicious selection or eclecticism. Good literary style was acquired through the discriminat- ing imitation, recombination, and transformation of previous and existing authors. This was a recurrent theme in Renais- sance treatises on imitation. Writing in the 1550s, Giambat- tista Giraldi Cinzio identified Virgil as the "rule ofjudgment" because "knowing human imperfection to be as it is, that a single man could not accomplish on his own the virtue of composing great things," Virgil, he wrote, "with marvelous judgment chose all of the good things that were to be found in all of the other Greek and Latin authors and gathered them into one" and in doing so provided "an utterly truthful example of the synthesis of Heroic grandeur." From the dark</page><page sequence="9">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 485 shadows, Virgil gathered together the best examples of poetry and "marvelously composed them in one beautiful body." Like painters who want to form a single image of female beauty, Virgil proceeded by "looking at all the beautiful women that they can and then by taking from each of them their best parts" in order "to achieve the Idea that they have in their minds" of "ultimate perfection."31 In his explanation of Virgil's exemplarity, Giraldi resorted to a number of tropes that were standard fare in writings about imitation. Above all was the notion that absolute per- fection ("l'ultima perfettione") or the Idea that preexisted in the mind of the artist ("1I Idea c'hanno nell'animo") con- sisted in the choosing ("scieglier"), taking ("togliono"), gath- ering ("accogliesse"), and synthesis ("la virti' del comporre") of those parts that would produce a beautiful body ("un bellissimo corpo"). This "body," moreover, was gendered in Giraldi's passage as the heroic exemplum ("della grandezza Heroica") in masculine terms and as idealized beauty ("la donnesca bellezza") in feminine terms. There was nothing particularly original in Giraldi's using female beauty as a metaphor for good imitation. The locus classicus for this type of judicious imitation was the tale of the Crotonian maidens told by Pliny and Cicero and reiterated in just about every text on imitation thereafter.32 Raphael glossed the Zeuxinian metaphor almost verbatim in the de- scription of his own artistic practice, and Giorgio Vasari used similar terms to praise Raphael."3 There was also nothing new in Giraldi's using heroic grandeur as metaphor for good 12 Raphael, Galatea, fresco, ca. 1511.

The image of the Hero served as a masculine parallel to the Zeuxinian woman, and Torquato Tasso, more than any other late-sixteenth-century author, would be re- sponsible for consolidating Renaissance theories of eclectic imitation into a new definition of the epic hero as a sort of Ubermensch who possessed the best virtues drawn from all previous heroes. Whether the artist alluded to the Zeuxinian Virgin or the Epic Hero, his preference for this style of composition in the late Renaissance extended from the theory of selective imi- tation that Gianfrancesco Pico advocated at the beginning of the sixteenth century in opposition to Pietro Bembo's pref- erence for the imitation of a single exemplary model for each genre.34 In the following century, the Carracci would be cited as the paradigmatic masters and proponents of the first tech- nique. In Malvasia's biography, Lodovico is heard telling Annibale: "to imitate a single master is to make oneself his follower and his inferior, while to draw from all of them and also select things from other painters is to make oneself their judge and leader."3" In the same vein, Piles pointed out that the "perceptive Annibale took from these Great Men every- thing that was good" and "converted it into his own sub- stance."36 Bellori praised Annibale's art for combining the "virtues of previous masters" and unifying that perfected style with the Idea and with nature.37 The advantage of a combinatory method also corre- sponded to a belief in the inherent imperfection of both man and nature. Cicero explained that Zeuxis selected five maid- ens precisely because "he did not think all the qualities which he sought to combine could be found in one person, because</page><page sequence="10">486 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 14 Guido Reni, Aurora, fresco, 1612- 14.

Luigi dei Francesi, Contarelli Chapel in no single case has Nature made anything perfect and finished in every part.""38 Writing about painting in the years just before Giraldi's treatise, Lodovico Dolce added that only through art is it possible to display "within a single body ... that entire perfection of beauty which nature barely exhibits in a thousand bodies." Hence, because "there is no human body so perfectly beautiful that it is not wanting in some respect," selective imitation was a matter of necessity.39 The eclectic principle, therefore, was at once an aesthetic and a moral one (and this may have had particular significance in a post-Tridentine era, when the Church encouraged the imitation not only of Christ but also of the Virgin and saints). The popularity of this model of imitation is reflected in the various metaphors that Renaissance and Baroque authors generated to describe the process.40 In the 1590 treatise the Idea del tempio di pittura, for instance, Giovanni Paolo Lo- mazzo constructed an elaborate astrological system, in which each of the seven celestial sectors-Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon-were controlled by seven governatori-Michelangelo, Gaudenzio Ferrari (Lomaz- zo's uncle and master), Polidoro da Caravaggio, Leonardo, Raphael, Andrea Mantegna, and Titian.41 Elsewhere, Lo- mazzo wrote that the perfect painting would be an Adam and Eve in which Adam was drawn by Michelangelo and painted by Titian and Eve was designed by Raphael and colored by Correggio.42 The immediate source for this version of the Zeuxinian story may have been a passage from Lucian, as Charles Demp- sey discovered, in which a statue of an ideal woman was described as a collaborative production undertaken by the</page><page sequence="11">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 487 best artists: "Euphranor giving her the hair he gave his Juno, Polygnotus the delicately tinted brows and cheeks of his Cassandra, Aetion the lips of his Roxana, and Apelles paint- ing the body as he had painted Campaspe."43 This was a significant and essential modification of the topos, for the peccadillo of imperfection was transferred from the source material (that is, nature) to the artist himself (that is, human nature). Hence, when Orlandi wrote that the Venetian painter Pietro Liberi developed his well-grounded style through "a perfect mistd' of the great masters of the past, he implied (as Pico had centuries before) that no one master could provide the artist with a complete model of perfec- tion.44 For Lomazzo, the collaboiation of the best styles provided the foundation for good painting. For other writers, such as Francesco Scannelli, it was a question of absorbing the very essence of each of these paradigmatic masters. Scannelli's ideal painter in I1 microcosmo della pittura (Cesena, 1657) possessed organs represented by different artists: Raphael was the liver (which receives from the blood of the mother its composition and perfection), Titian the heart (for the nour- ishment provided to it by the liver makes the heart more vigorous and forceful, which makes everything in turn more natural and sane), and Correggio the brain (for a healthy liver and heart enable the brain to order its thoughts and compose its arguments).45 Boschini commenced the Carta del navegar pitoresco (Venice, 1660) with an image even more esoteric than both Lomazzo's and Scannelli's models: Venetian painting as a "pictorial ship." On Boschini's metaphoric ship of ideal style, individual artists simultaneously symbolized different struc- tural parts of the vessel and held specific roles on board. Giovanni Bellini was at once the structure and the builder of the ship. Giorgione was the rudder that provided direction and the patron who nurtured the crew. II Pordenone repre- sented the ribs of the hull; Jacopo Bassano the captain's quarters as well as the storerooms and the night guard; Giovanni Battista Zelotti the mast; Giuseppe Salviati the sail and watchman; Paris Bordone the stern; Paolo Veronese the navigation light and manager; Andrea Schiavone the caulk and Palma Vecchio the tar that held the structure together and also the helmsman and assistant captain. Tintoretto's fierce style made him the cannons and the commander of the artillery, and Boschini's hero, Titian, was the supreme navi- gator and captain of the metaphoric boat.46 Even Padovanino was given a role, as the standard-bearer of the squadron.47 At bottom, it seems that Lomazzo, Scannelli, and Boschini were concerned with defining ideals: painting, the painter, and style; in spite of their different approaches, all three resorted to metaphors of eclecticism. This type of metonymic classification was based on two ancient sources, the first being the passage from Lucian already mentioned above. The sec- ond point of reference was the twelfth book of Quintilian's Institutio oratoria, in which he lists the stylistic strengths of individual painters and sculptors as a parallel for the various styles of oratory (Polygnotus and Aglaophon for their simple coloring; Zeuxis and Parrhasius for their special attention to line; Protogenes for his accuracy; Pamphilius and Melanthius for their soundness of taste; Antiphilius for his facility; Theon 16 Annibale Carracci, Assumption of the Virgin, oil on panel, 1601. Rome, S. Maria del Popolo, Cerasi Chapel of Samos for his depiction of imaginary scenes; and Apelles for his grace).48 Following Quintilian's formula, seicento authors similarly enumerated lists of ideal models. Bernini's admiration for Annibale Carracci was summarized in a metaphor of gastro- nomic mixture: [Annibale] had combined the grace and draftsmanship of Raphael, the knowledge and anatomical science of Michel- angelo, the nobility of Correggio and this master's manner of painting, the coloring of Titian, the fertile imagination of Giulio Romano and Andrea Mantegna. His manner was formed from the ten or twelve greatest painters as if by walking through a kitchen he had dipped into each pot, adding from each a little to his own mixture.49 Bernini may have based his comments on a passage from Malvasia's biography of Annibale in which he specified that in order to become a good painter, one must acquire "Ro- man disegno, the movement and shadowing of the Venetians, and the dignified colors of Lombardy," or, more specifically, one must take "from Michelangelo the awesome way, the true and natural from Titian, the pure and refined style from Correggio, decorum and structure from Tibaldi, invention</page><page sequence="12">488 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 17 Domenichino, Assumption of the Virgin, oil on canvas, 1616-17. Rome, S. Maria in Trastevere from the wise Primaticcio, and a bit of grace from Parmigi- anino."50 Baroque authors, it would appear, took special pleasure in compiling their own canon of ideal models. Piles, in partic- ular, loved this sort of game, even if his pantheon was pop- ulated by the usual suspects: Raphael for his invention, Mi- chelangelo for drawing, Giulio Romano for nobility and magnificence, Correggio for force and vigor, Titian for color, composition, naturalism, and grace, and Paolo Veronese for his invention, the nobility of his figures, the magnificence of his drapery, and the facility, beauty, and movement of his forms.5' The strangely Cartesian charts that Piles graphs in the Balance des peintres (Paris, 1708), where artists are judged on a scale of one to twenty for their composition, drawing, color, and expression, can be seen as an extreme manifesta- tion of this taxonomic impulse.52 In spite of the popularity of such "mixed" metaphors, it does not follow that an established doctrine of eclecticism dominated seicento theory and practice.53 This was one way of theorizing practice, and while some artists might have prac- ticed this theory, not everyone was convinced of the effective- ness of the eclectic method. Pietro da Cortona considered it faulty, for who would find beauty in a figure composed of parts melded together from two antithetical painters such as the Cavaliere d'Arpino and Caravaggio?54 Despite his own anthropomorphic metaphor, Scannelli questioned the soundness of Lomazzo's fictive Adam and Eve: Titian, he argued, would try to correct Michelangelo's drawing in his own style, and Michelangelo would not stand for it.55 Bernini, in spite of his admiration for Annibale, was also wary of the success rate of the eclectic method, fearing that the overall effect would be one of fragmentation.56 Against the Zeuxin- ian Virgin, writers would posit the grotesque Horatian mon- ster-the human with the head of a horse, the woman with the body of a fish-as an example of the dangers of eclecti- cism. This indicates that the stitching on Zeuxis's Virgin was more evident to some viewers than to others, and to her critics she appeared more like Frankenstein's bride than a vision of beauty. A more moderate point of view advised artists against mak- ing a grotesque hodgepodge of collected bits and bobs that did not belong together and to proceed, instead, like an "ingenious bee" that extracts "sweetness from all the flowers of painting" and turns it into honey.57 In the metaphors of the "mixed" style, it was a question of ensuring, in the first place, that the components chosen for imitation would be compatible one with the other and, secondly, that this eclec- tic imitation would enable a more independently achieved transformative imitation. In other words, while repetition was the modus operandi, the final product had to be ordered by a unified idea del bello. Critics borrowed the apian metaphor and similar ones involving digestion, fathers and sons, and singers and choruses from Seneca's eighty-fourth letter to Lucilius, "On Gathering Ideas."58</page><page sequence="13">TALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 489 Underlying the discourse, which circumvented the expla- nation of the artist's practice of eclectic imitation and the visual exegete's process of recognizing the "mixed" style, was an acute consciousness of a copresence of different identities within one entity. Seneca's parallel between fathers and sons was one of the most poetic metaphors about imitation. Some centuries later, Francesco Petrarch (glossing Seneca) would explain that in imitation the similarity should be not like that of a portrait to the man it is portraying but like that of a child to his parent, for "in this case, even though there may be a considerable dissimilarity in features, yet there is a certain shadow ... [that] ... recalls to our mind the memory of the father.... something hidden there has this effect.""59 In sev- enteenth-century terms, Matteo Peregrini referred to this interpretative optic that successfully identified that "certain shadow" as "amphibolia [Amfibolia]" or as an ability to see the "double sense [senso doppio].,'60 Through the Looking Glass of Acutezza: Speaking Metaphorically, Seeing Metaphorically Baroque spectators were open to the type of aesthetic expe- riences based on sharp, associative, lateral thinking, which looked for shadows of the father in the son, which engaged with the "double sense," which embraced the metaphor and the double entendre, and which looked for the intertext and engaged with intentional play. David Freedberg argued that the first quarter of the seicento witnessed an intense curiosity about optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes.61 The development of these new instruments normalized the concept of multiple perception; spectators were capable of seeing and, more important, of expecting to see more than meets the eye. This very curiosity has specific implications for our understanding of repetition in the visual and literary arts. In classical rhetoric, the vehicle for demonstrating artistic ingenuity was the witticism (acutezza). A witticism was a pointed saying, an expression that generated wonder, and an oratorical device that functioned like what Quintilian called sententias, which are pithy statements that "strike the mind and often produce a decisive effect by one single blow, while their very brevity makes them cling to the memory.""62 Witti- cisms pushed the listener and viewer to think metaphorically since, as Aristotle wrote, "metaphors must be drawn ... from things that are related to the original thing, and yet not obviously so related-just as in philosophy also an acute mind will perceive resemblances even in things far apart.""63 Seven- teenth-century literary critics, like Emanuele Tesauro, turned Aristotle's appreciation of metaphor into a Baroque theory of acutezza, for both the metaphor and the witticism say one thing while suggesting another. Such rhetorical ornaments multiply the listener's delight since, as Tesauro explained, "seeing many objects from an unusual angle is more curious and pleasing than seeing the same things passing directly before our eyes. Ajob (as our author [Aristotle] says) not for a dull mind but for a most acute one."64 This delight is magnified by novelty, which is when "the sound is known and only the meaning is new" or when something is "old in substance and new in manner." The leading Baroque theorist of acutezza, Tesauro, still glossing Aristotle, asserted that the metaphor packs "objects tightly together in a single word and almost miraculously allows you to see one inside the other."""65 At bottom, seeing metaphorically was all about being able to see several things at once (for example, the new in the old and vice versa) and to see one thing in several ways (such as originality in repetition). Through the Baroque looking glass of acutezza, knowledge- able spectators proceeded both microscopically and telescop- ically when viewing images, moving from one detail to an- other in order to see the larger whole. The ability to see strategic repetition was particularly enjoyable for certain view- ers, for, according to one writer, "Imitation lies hidden; it does not stand out. It conceals rather than reveals itself and does not wish to be recognized except by a learned man."66 Like the humanist reader (and the postmodernist reader/author as well) who was able to identify the mosaic of quotations within a given text, the "learned man" found gratification through intellectual snobbery and the pleasure of untangling difference from repetition. Tesauro wrote that "wit loses its insight when a saying is too clear." However, he continued, "Stars sparkle in the darkness, but become dim in the light," meaning that certain types of literary conceits function only when the author and reader are aware of the rules of engagement. Since witty images "are sketched rather than finished," as Tesauro further elabo- rated, "the listener supplies what is absent in the voice of the speaker." Because of these collaborative efforts, witticisms and metaphors necessarily possess a "double pleasure," for the "one who forms a witty concept and another who hears it. For the first enjoys giving life in another intellect to a noble product of his own, and the second enjoys grasping by his own ingenuity what the ingenuity of another furtively hides.""'67 When the Lucchese painter Paolo Guidotti, for example, set about composing his (unrealized) poem La Gerusalemme distrutta in emulation of Tasso's epic La Gerusa- lemme liberata (Venice, 1581), he intended and expected his readers to notice that the last line of each octave was in fact the same as in Tasso's poem.68 Witty conceits, in short, were reserved for the quick of mind, for an audience attentive to the possibility of double meanings and on whom allusions would not be lost. Again, the use of witty conceits was a matter of taste. Galileo, inventor of the telescope, preferred the clarity of Lodovico Ariosto's style to the allegorical mode (or "im- pulse") of Tasso's poetry.69 Giambattista Marino, the self- professed poet of extravagance whose hero was Tasso, reveled in the use of witticisms. The Jesuit orator Sforza Pallavicino, in his Considerazioni sopra l'arte dello stile e del dialogo (Rome, 1646), cautioned against the overuse of rhetorical orna- ments. Baltasar Gracian, the Spanish courtier and author of Agudeza y arte de ingenio (Huesca, 1649), saw wit as an essential human quality. Peregrini's two treatises Delle acutezze (Genoa, 1639) and Ifonti dell'ingegno ridotti ad arte (Bologna, 1650) tried to outline a guide to the invention of witty expressions that would prevent the abuse of such ornaments. Tesauro, on the other hand, was wholeheartedly of Marino and Graciin's persuasion. Boschini, too, was a big fan of acutezza. An unabashed Venetian patriot, he had a tendency to see Venetian quota- tions, allusions, themes, and stylistic borrowings in every- thing, but he was not alone. With the neo-Venetian revival of the early seicento, artists and critics participated in various</page><page sequence="14">490 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 18 Caravaggio, Card Sharps, oil on canvas, 1594. Fort Worth, Tex., Kimbell Art Museum (photo: @ 2003 by Kimbell Art Museum) ways in the reinvigoration of Venetian style.70 Standing in front of Annibale Carracci's Assumption, Malvasia, for in- stance, commented that Annibale "looked at Tintoretto" in order to paint his altarpiece, but that when it came to "the more learned and magnificent drapery folds," Annibale "sought out Veronese."71 "Venetianness" became increasingly popular, and with this change in taste a sensitivity for such repetition also became more widespread. The two objects of repetition in Malvasia's passage-Tin- toretto's style and Veronese's folds-also provide a good distinction between following another artist's style (maniera) as opposed to repeating an actual figure or iconographic type (figura, concetto) from a painting. Figure and concetti, however, were sometimes conflated with maniera. One example of this slip is the association of half-length male portraits as a quint- essentially Giorgionesque referent. Looking at Caravaggio's Card Sharps (Fig. 18), both Baldinucci and Bellori described it as an imitation of Giorgione's "pure" style ("modo d'inventare schietto"; "schietta maniera").72 Likewise, Pietro della Vecchia's soldier portraits (Fig. 19) were considered as Giorgionesque "extractions [astratti]," and the seicento Ve- netian painter was even called Giorgione's "twin [gemello]." 73 Baldinucci and Bellori were probably looking at the Del Monte version of the Card Sharps painted for Cardinal Francesco del Monte (or a variant copy of it); Boschini was looking at one of the many bravi portraits for which della Vecchia was famous.74 When we look at the paintings of Caravaggio and della Vecchia next to each other today, the stylistic difference is as great as that between works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lich- tenstein. In both Caravaggio and della Vecchia's depictions of half-length male figures dressed in fancy hats with feathers, a thematic or iconographic resemblance-that is, of figure or concetti-is evident, but the style-that is, the technique-is intrinsically different. Caravaggio's stark naturalism gives way to della Vecchia's painterly Venetian brushwork; Caravag- gio's carefully studied faces dissolve in della Vecchia's sketchy physiognomies; and Caravaggio's balanced lighting melts in della Vecchia's smoky haze. 19 Pietro della Vecchia, Soldier, oil on canvas, ca. 1660. Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum In spite of this remarkable stylistic gap, viewers still saw Giorgione lurking about-Senecan brothers who shared their father's features in different ways. Did the artists want the viewer to see Giorgione in these paintings? Did these artists want the beholder to acknowledge their mastery of and over the Renaissance master? Both painters were attentive to Giorgione's art in their own practice. Caravaggio, as Zuccaro and Bellori remarked, seems to have studied his works in Venice or elsewhere, and della Vecchia was responsible for the seventeenth-century restoration of Giorgione's Castel- franco altarpiece and for a number of portraits that subse- quent connoisseurs mistook for authentic Giorgiones, even in della Vecchia's own time. Caravaggio did not directly confirm an admiration for the Venetian Renaissance painter, but della Vecchia explained to Boschini that he had made one of these Giorgionesque pic- tures "off the top of his head without using a model and without copying from Giorgione" in order to "demonstrate his knowledge" to his father-in-law, the Flemish caravaggista, Nicolo Renieri.75 By admitting that he painted it "without copying from Giorgione," della Vecchia nevertheless invoked the name of the artist that he believed his viewers would see in his painting. By stating that he painted it in order to "demonstrate his knowledge," della Vecchia seems to suggest that he hoped his viewer would recognize his-namely, della Vecchia's-virtuosity precisely in his ability to paint like an- other. In some paintings, this form of stylistic repetition operated through ambiguous allusion to maniera, gusto, intentione, idea,</page><page sequence="15">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 491 figura, concetto, or a combination of these elements, which viewers recognized as being something "old in substance and new in manner," to quote Tesauro again. And viewers did make this distinction when looking at such paintings. Bos- chini, for example, insisted that della Vecchia's "imitations" were not mere "copies" after Giorgione but were "extracted from his own intellect," underlining at once della Vecchia's stylistic dexterity and individual agency.76 True imitation, as Tesauro insisted, did not entail taking metaphors and witty expressions exactly as you heard or read them, for "that way you would not be praised as an imitator but blamed as a thief." Imitating Praxiteles'"Apollo, he continued, did not mean literally taking it from the Cortile Belvedere into one's own home but "carving another piece of marble to the same proportions, so that Praxiteles on seeing it would marvel and say, 'This Apollo is mine, yet it is not mine.""'77 Again, we seem to be returning to the theme of resemblance that is encap- sulated in the father and son, or the generational trope. Boschini claimed that della Vecchia's bravi portraits could be found in the "galleries of princes and gentlemen," where "the virtue of della Vecchia [sto Vechia] is masked." "Who," Boschini concluded, "could ask for a more beautiful, cunning device that tricks those who see his canvases?"78 It goes with- out saying that Boschini's own acutezza is demonstrated here in the play on Vechia (a double reference to the artist's name and to his intentional stylistic archaism) and on the word tele (meaning both canvases and veils). Like Boschini, who says one thing while intending another, della Vecchia's bravi were not just portraits of soldiers but also "cunning devices [in- zegno artificial]" that pleased the spectator by making evident that what he saw was not necessarily the only thing that he got. Beneath the mask of one image another image was revealed. The competitive paragone of authors and artists appealed to an aesthetic disposition, which looked on a specific work of art as a physical element within a larger conceptual work of art produced from the mental comparison and contrast of the physical object on hand with an entire repertoire of previous and similar works. Writing about Padovanino's ceil- ing tondo in the Marciana, which was made to replace Bat- tista Franco's destroyed picture, Carlo Ridolfi noted that Padovanino "alluded to Franco's concetto."79 A specific work is being referenced in this example, and here we slide from the repetition of style in all of its ambiguous guises to the repe- tition of particular motifs and entire compositional passages tout court. With even more precision, Annibale Roncaglia at the end of the sixteenth century described Titian's Bacchus and Ari- adne simply as "a painting in which the Laocoon is painted" (referring to the bearded figure with the snakes in the fore- ground on the right).80 Evidently, Roncaglia saw Titian's figure as a repetition of the central figure in the Laoco6n group and, more important, he expected his reader to un- derstand and also see his reference. In front of Van Dyck's equestrian portrait of King Charles I of England (Fig. 20), Bellori had no problems identifying the quotation therein of Titian's equestrian portrait of Charles V (Fig. 21).s8 Likewise, in referring to Rubens as "the new Titian [el nuevo Ticiano]," the seventeenth-century Spanish poet Lope Felix de Vega was 20 Van Dyck, Equestrian Portrait of Charles I, oil on canvas, 1638. London, National Gallery also making a direct connection between Rubens's lost por- trait of Philip IV and its Titianesque referent.82 There is an interpretative a priori that binds these isolated examples together. I allude to the expectation of an in- formed audience whose members share a common knowl- edge of the visual codes and references called into play. Pallavicino explained in his seicento treatise on acutezza that "admissable witty remarks produce wonderment by showing the contrary to what is expected, the different from what is expected, or the astonishing despite it being nonetheless expected."83 In all three scenarios, acutezza addressed itself to the listener's expectations. Looking at works of art in this manner corresponded with a type of aesthetic pleasure in the redundant and predictable and also in the redundant and unexpected. A certain notion of originality as repetition, therefore, can be discerned within the Baroque concept of acutezza. Originality, in this sense, resided in the way some- thing was presented and the way that mode of presentation pushed the viewer to see things in a different and unantici- pated way. Consider the following example: when Domenichino painted a picture of the expulsion of Adam and Eve (Fig. 22), he clearly recast Michelangelo's Divine Father from the Sis- tine ceiling (Fig. 11) in a new role as Adam's judge rather than as Adam's creator. The obvious allusion could not have been lost on the erudite Roman audience for whom Dome- nichino (or another artist) repainted this image several times.84 The numerous replicative versions document the</page><page sequence="16">492 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 21 Titian, Portrait of Charles V on Horseback, oil on canvas, 1548. Madrid, Museo del Prado existence of a particular taste for such pictures, which seem to have been appreciated precisely because they were pas- tiches of well-known images.85 Domenichino's own imagery, too, was subjected to unau- thorized repetition. In a painting (questionably) attributed to Carlo Maratti, the artist reused the bold reclining nymph in the foreground of Domenichino's Diana and the Nymphs as an unlikely model for the virtuous Susanna (Figs. 23, 24).86 In Domenichino's painting, the nymph is but a minor character within the larger tale of Diana and her numerous nymphs. She looks out at the spectator while reclining in a shallow pool of water with another nymph at her side. In the alleged Maratti painting, on the other hand, she is the main charac- ter. With the composition cropped, her intense gaze becomes more emphatic. Her nude body is highlighted against the dark shadows of the grove, where the two elders peer through a space in the trees to the left. The composition gives the effect of looking at Domenichino's Diana through a telescope and glimpsing instead Maratti's surprising twist on Domeni- chino's concetto. From these examples we might draw several conclusions. First, a witty painting could be thought of as a performance, a theater in which figure and concetti, like stock characters from the Commedia dell'Arte, enact a known drama to an audience interested not so much in the way the story ends (for it always ends in the same way) as in the way that story is represented. Second, repetition necessarily discloses the op- eration of time in the construction of historical consciousness and reveals how one work situates itself in relation to an- other. Repetition turns backward in order to advance for- ward. At the same time, repetition is neither nostalgic nor bound by a morose alterity. This brings us to our third conclusion. An ambition to succeed and surpass one's pre- decessors is the driving force behind the emulative impulse of repetition as paragone. Whether the artist was successful or not is an issue of individual judgment, but an inspired one- upmanship usually motivated repetition, even in those in- stances where pastiche blurred over into outright parody. Maratti's conceit, for instance, was tweaked yet again as his lascivious Susanna regained her form as a nymph in a paint- ing representing Diana and Acteon (Fig. 25), which came out of Maratti's studio. Here, the majestic goddess stands above her nymphs as the frightened Acteon flees into the dark woods. The young women huddled in Diana's shadow scram- ble to cover themselves, turning their heads away from the male intruder. Even Acteon raises his right hand in an at- tempt to blind himself from the forbidden spectacle. One figure, however, sits alone in the foreground, unaware of or unconcerned by the commotion around her. That figure is our nymph, whose bold gaze functions like a sly, complicit wink to the implied viewer of the painting. She is also the only literal quotation from Domenichino's painting of the same subject to appear in the picture; the other figures are para- phrases from works by Annibale and Albani.87 Without a good sense of humor, an appreciation of the ironic, and an ability to see one thing for another, a viewer would have found the double entendre of a female nude as both the chaste Susanna and a lascivious nymph meaningless. Luca Giordano's out-of-context quotations of Michelangelo's Dawn from the Lorenzo de' Medici Tomb and Night from the Giuliano de' Medici Tomb and Titian's Bacchus (Fig. 4) in his own Bacchanal paintings of the 1670s and 1680s similarly manipulate "old substance" in a "new manner." In one ver- sion (Fig. 9), two members of Bacchus's entourage are seen lifting a red cloth under which a sleeping woman is revealed. The unlikely coupling of the stony reclining female referent being discovered by the effeminate, sun-kissed Bacchus glow- ing in his Venetian colors must have provided a surprise based on a stylistic and gender reversal of the usual repre- sentation of the two protagonists, as if Michelangelo and Titian's figures were somehow represented in drag. In another painting of the same theme (Fig. 10), Giorda- no's Ariadne looks like Titian's figure seen from another angle or as a mirror image. Her legs are in the same position, her back is arched in the same manner, and her hair has been gathered in the same style. The drapery flows in a similar pattern, although in the later painting more of her back is exposed to us. Titian's Ariadne faces Bacchus, who leaps from his chariot to greet her; in Giordano's picture, she turns her back on him and glances instead outward to the viewer, while with her left arm she gestures forward, almost as if she is leading the animated cortege that follows. Giordano's painting reads as a remake of Titian's painting, with some help from Annibale Carracci and the generation of imitators that followed him. In the earlier rendition, Titian depicts Silenus in the background, asleep and slumped over. The muscular "Laocoon" figure is seen advancing from the side as he struggles with a snake. The nymph next to him raises her cymbals. The two leopards stop in their tracks and</page><page sequence="17">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 493 22 Domenichino, Adam and Eve, oil on copper, ca. 1623. Grenoble, Musae de Peinture et de Sculpture (photo: Art Resource, NY) look at each other. In Giordano's version, Silenus has awak- ened. The bearded figure twists to face us as he frees himself from one of the snakes. The cymbals have sounded, and one of the leopards has turned to look at a goat harassing a putto in the foreground. The whole composition is recognizably Titianesque, but as Francesco Baldinucci remarked about this work, the invention ("il tutto d'invenzione") was beautiful and Giordano was at his best here.88 Novitd and Furto: Sibling Rivalry and Paternity Suits The parentage of Giordano's bacchanals is evident. Similarly, the paintings of Padovanino, Poussin, Van Dyck, and Rubens point to Titian as the shared figurative father. Siblings, how- ever, were often prone to rivalries, and in the section below we will consider a specific incident that introduces to our discussion the notion of repetition as novelty (novita) and as theft (furto). Tesauro, with his usual flair for metaphors, elaborated: Novelty is necessary for every witty production, and with- out this, marvel is diluted as well as grace and applause. I therefore call imitation a type of wisdom whereby you propose to yourself a metaphor or some other flower of human ingenuity; then you attentively consider its roots; and transplanting it into different categories as though into well-ploughed and fertile soil, you cause other flowers of the same species to be generated, but not the same individuals.89 This passage makes evident, first, the intimate connection between novelty, wit, imitation, and metaphor and, second, how the concept of novita articulated a type of originality</page><page sequence="18">494 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 2 23 Domenichino, Diana and the Nymphs, oil on canvas, 1616-17. Rome, Galleria Borghese 24 Carlo Maratti, Susanna and the Elders, oil on canvas, ca. 1640s? Rome, Galleria Corsini based on repetition. In each of Tesauro's examples, some- thing new results from something old. The new is necessarily different from the old, but it is the careful investment of the old that ensures the survival of the new. Tesauro's metaphors also recall the Senecan/Petrarchan trope about sons resembling their fathers yet acquiring their own faces. The detection of that "certain shadow" of differ- ence between the father and son became for many seicento beholders a delicious exercise and display of one's knowl- edge. But under different circumstances the visibility of rep- etition could become the bete noir that spoiled a picture. "The spirit of allusion," one critic has written recently, "is at the furthest remove from envious malignity, though the pos- sibility of envy and malignity must always hang around any allusion."90 Professional jealousies, for instance, sometimes intervened, problematizing the dialogic viewing process. One such case unfolded between Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco. When Domenichino made the Adam and Eve paintings in the 1620s and 1630s, the Bolognese painter (then in his</page><page sequence="19">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 495 25 Studio of Carlo Maratti, Diana and Acteon, oil on canvas, before 1675. Oxford, Christ Church Picture Gallery forties) had already become a celebrated artist in his own right: The pastiches, therefore, were made for a pleasure not tied to the urgency of proving himself in the competitive Roman art world. This, however, was not the first nor the last time that Domenichino would repeat the invention of an- other artist. In fact, such blatant appropriation was quite common in Domenichino's practice. In 1614-the year that Padovanino was in Rome-Dome- nichino unveiled his Saint Jerome altarpiece in the Roman church of S. Girolamo della Caritai (Fig. 26). Approximately ten years later Lanfranco, who had been a student in the Carracci workshop with Domenichino, attacked him, claim- ing that the artist had stolen the idea from a work of the same subject, which was in the Certosa in Bologna, by their master, Agostino Carracci (Fig. 27). Here Lanfranco clearly showed himself to be one of those viewers who did not think such citations were particularly witty or ingenious. Lanfranco even ordered one of his own pupils, Francois Perrier, to go to Bologna to etch a copy after Agostino's painting so that all of Rome could see the theft.9' Rome did not respond as Lanfranco hoped. Instead, artists and critics alike applauded Domenichino's appropriation, which was, ironically enough, confirmed by the print. The encounter was retold decades later as a story of "intense competition [grandissima emulatione]" between Lanfranco and Domenichino. The former, as Bellori explained, con- demned his colleague's altarpiece as a "theft [furto]" that was "lifted [tolta]" from "the invention [inventione]" of their mas- ter.92 Bellori himself decided enthusiastically in favor of Domenichino, for even though Domenichino "followed Agostino Carracci's motif," even Agostino would have recog- nized that Domenichino's design and expression possessed "great merit above all other painters of this century.""93 Andrea Sacchi also praised Domenichino's altarpiece, and Poussin, overwhelmed by its beauty, even compared it to Raphael's Transfiguration.94 Giovanni Baglione found it "very beautiful [bellissimo]" and "greatly pleasing [molto piacuto] ."95 An official papal report suggested that "Domenichino of Bologna's very beautiful painting" was "praised by every- one."96 We must not conclude too hastily that all Baroque critics ruled in Domenichino's favor. Opinions, as always, were di- vided. Pietro da Cortona, for one, wrote to his friend Paolo Falconieri that "all the painters said bad things about it."97 Malvasia criticized Domenichino's painting for being bela- bored, hard, and ungraceful, but added, "and what painter in some way does not steal? Either from prints or reliefs or nature or works by others, reversing postures, twisting an arm lower, displaying a leg, changing a face, adding a drapery-in sum, judiciously hiding the theft?""98 Luigi Scaramuccia fol- lowed the same line, making a special note of all the materials that Domenichino borrowed from the Carracci. But he drew a still different conclusion, arguing that Domenichino de- served great praise precisely because he succeeded in being a thief without appearing to be one.99 In the 1670s Giovanni Passeri wrote that opinions had been divided between "who was against Domenichino, who against Lanfranco, according to hatred or affection."100 These observations serve to underline the complexity and variety of tastes in seventeenth-century Italy and to point to how the perception of originality and good judgment was often altered by social and political alliances rather than theoretical or stylistic principles.101 In a strange anecdote repeated by Antoine Coypel, in his Discours sur la peinture (1708-21) addressed to the Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, he claimed not only that Domenichino had been the "victim of an unjust conspiracy" but also that many artists, including Bernini, were scared to get involved in the affair.'02 Others were not so fearful. To cite a case in point, Passeri sided with Domenichino: Even though Domenichino used some of the figures from the Farnese Gallery by Carracci in those pictures, it does not deserve to be censured on account of this. Nor should</page><page sequence="20">496 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 26 Domenichino, The Last Communion of Saint Jerome, oil on canvas, 1614. Vatican, Pinacoteca it be accused of weakness in invention, nor lacking in good structure because through his theft, Domenichino makes us discover a greater truth [una saggia avvedutezza], which knows how to use a pose, applying it in such an adept manner as it deems necessary and appropriate. Adapting [the figures] to a precise end that renders them perfectly placed and successful, Domenichino always gives a clear demonstration of a profound knowledge and a most per- fect taste in all of his works.103 Reading Passeri's passage against the grain, it would seem that artists were indeed subject to censure for the repetition of figures from another work of art: if carried out unsuccess- fully, their work could be seen as weak in invention and lacking in structure. However, because Domenichino trans- forms the old motif and allows the viewer to appreciate it in a different light, the repetition is judged to be successful. Elsewhere, Passeri pointed out Domenichino's "sharp wit [acutezza d'ingegno]" in all things related to painting.104 A good artist did not necessarily have to be someone who 27 Agostino Carracci, The Last Communion of SaintJerome, oil on canvas, 1590s. Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale introduced something never before seen-he could equally be someone who gave new life to old forms. In spite of the resemblance of Domenichino's Saint Jerome to its referent, or precisely because of it, Domenichino's painting was considered the revelation of a "deeper truth." This second-degree interpretation required the viewer to engage in some mental acrobatics, which would push him to look beyond the immediate picture and beyond the initial similarity so as to perceive at once Agostino's picture, Do- menichino's painting, and the paragone that ensued from the confrontation between the two. Central in the debate surrounding the positive reception of the Saint Jerome altarpiece was the idea of novelty (novitca). Poussin, speaking about Domenichino's painting, put it like this: "Novelty in painting does not consist above all in choos- ing a subject that has never been seen before but upon a good and novel arrangement and expression, thanks to which the subject, though in itself ordinary and worn, be- comes new and singular."'05 In this passage on novelty, itself lifted more or less verbatim from Tasso's definition of novelty in poetry, written some decades before, Poussin at once</page><page sequence="21">[TALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 497 endorses Domenichino's work and justifies his own imitative practice vis-fi-vis Titian and other sixteenth-century artists.106 In 1625 it may have seemed that Lanfranco had made his point-at least with some spectators. However, by the time Bellori, Passeri, and the others were rewriting the story of that confrontation, Domenichino proved himself to be the more ingenious artist, at least in the eyes of his colleagues who rallied to his defense. This form of repetition or visual cita- tion may or may not have suited the taste of every spectator, but it was certainly inscribed in the practices of seventeenth- century artists and in the responses of viewers. The question of invention through repetition manifested itself in other domains as well. In the 1620s, at about the same time as the Domenichino-Lanfranco conflict, a similar con- troversy about novita erupted surrounding Marino's epic poem L'Adone (Paris, 1623). Generally speaking, in seven- teenth-century editions of the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca, novita was defined as "a new, unusual thing, which comes about unexpectedly."'107 More specifically, Monsu Capellano (Jean Chapelain) defined two forms of "natural" novita in his 1625 defense of Marino: the first and more perfect type of novelty referred to new discoveries, objects and subjects that had never been seen or heard before; the second and less perfect species of novelty was used to de- scribe discoveries of new ways of saying or using old things (as when Domenichino changed Michelangelo's God the Cre- ator into God the Judge and when Maratti transformed Do- menichino's indecent nymph into the virtuous Susanna- or, indeed, when Levine appropriated the images of earlier pho- tographers) .108 Capellano's "perfect form" of "natural novelty" would even- tually develop into our modern notion of "originality," with all of its qualitative demands on originary primacy. And yet, perfect forms, in the seicento, were rare occurrences. One of the dangers of this type of novelty, as Capellano explained, was that it slipped into "unnatural" forms, presenting itself as truly novel but ultimately grotesque inventions (like satyrs and hermaphrodites, which although never seen before were nonetheless unnatural forms).109 The perfect form of natural novelty was more applicable to scientific discoveries and in- ventions than to poetic and artistic ones. The imperfect form of natural novelty, on the other hand, was closer to the more commonly accepted usage of novita as applied to the creative arts in the seventeenth century. Crucial to this form of premodernist originality was the concept of wonder (maraviglia)-in contrast, for example, to the idea of singularity. Tesauro linked novith closely with an unexpected presentation of things that generates the marvel- ous.110 Likewise, Girolamo Aleandri wrote that the novith of Marino's phrases and concepts consisted in the "marvel [ma- raviglia]" that was produced in the way he presented his subject matter, regardless of whether it was new or bor- rowed."' This emphasis on maraviglia, then, underlines the importance of the presentational or performative nature of the work of art for seventeenth-century audiences-old in substance, new in manner-and explains the popularity of Domenichino's repetitive works. Marino's most vehement critic was Tomaso Stigliani, who in 1627 published in Venice a meticulous analysis of L'Adone entitled The Telescope (Dello occhiale). Through his critical loupe, Stigliani observed four different areas in which L'Adone failed: the story (favola), the presentation (locuzione), the composition (sentenza), and the decorum (costume). Within each of these realms of censure, Stigliani identified more flaws: the characters were not heroic enough. The plot did not have a clear beginning, middle, or end. No less problematic, the episodes were poorly developed and badly linked. Certain events were not credible and the story lacked a happy ending. Stylistically, the language was riddled with neologisms and foreign terms, and the composition was mud- dled by excessive ornaments. Finally, the tale was wanting of a proper moral. These categories of censure provide us with rich informa- tion regarding the complexity of aesthetic tastes in this pe- riod. Even Stigliani was not entirely consistent. On the one hand, he complained because Marino slid into the repeti- tious, because he recycled similar episodes throughout his work, and because he failed to transform the presentation and development of the story.112 But then, in another pas- sage, Stigliani was dissatisfied with L'Adone because Marino presented an unconventional twist on the standard, ex- pected, traditional tale of Venus and Adonis. Instead of tell- ing the tale from the perspective of the hero, Adonis, and instead of focusing on his courtship of and union with Venus, Marino created a disjointed, fragmented text riddled with citations, paraphrases, and a narrative that constantly lost its way in endless digressions.""3 Stigliani looked on Marino's poem as a "messy pile [un mucchio disordinato]," a "confused heap [una massa confusa] ," and a Horatian monster lacking in "unity [il tutto integrale]," much like the painting of his day, Stigliani added.114 Thus, although Marino retold the story of Venus and Adonis from a novel point of view (from that of Venus), Stigliani found it both inappropriate and unsuccess- ful. The fifth transgression under Stigliani's third rubric-pre- sentation (sentenza)--had to do with novitai. Novelty, Stigliani explained, was "when the concept is not torn away from another but is born from one's own body [viscere]."115 The violence of this image points to the underlying jealousy Stigli- ani felt toward Marino. Marino's Adone was immensely pop- ular and Stigliani was surely hurt by this, claiming throughout the Occhiale that Marino stole many of his ideas. To underline the injury, Stigliani compared Marino's rapacious method of composition with those anatomy books in which amputated limbs hang on pages to be collected and reassembled by young painters.'16 The overwhelming response in support of Marino ex- pressed itself in letters, treatises, and even parodies of Stigli- ani. Aleandri wondered whether Stigliani's "telescope" might not need adjusting, and Scipione Herrico entitled his re- sponse The Blurry Telescope (L'occhiale appanato) to ridicule Stigliani's pedantic optic."7 Robusto Pogommega sneered: "Listen to me, Stigliani, as a good friend, without going into a rage and fury, your Mondo nuovo isn't worth a fig .... the style is low, insipid, and dated; it lacks knowledge and fla- vor."8 And to humiliate Stigliani further, one writer even published a list of authors who unreservedly supported Marino.1"9 Like Domenichino, Marino was praised not only for being a good poet but also for being an excellent thief. Following</page><page sequence="22">498 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 3 Marino's outline on poetic inspiration, Herrico explained that when a writer borrows from the ancients, he should be called an "imitator" rather than a "thief," for such citations serve as ornament within the story.120 Herrico distinguished between simple plagiarism and commendable expropriation when the stolen tale is improved, better when retold.121 Marino, he concluded, "needs to be not excused but praised for knowing how to turn shit into gold."122 Herrico's last comment marks a significant shift from the late Renaissance theories of imitation, which permitted only the imitation of the best sources. In the literary debate around Marino, it was commonly acknowledged that being able to improve a bad model was as praiseworthy as trans- forming an old classic. Some decades later, the Jesuit author Daniello Bartoli wrote that "it is not theft" if one is able to produce something beautiful from "useless and vile materi- als" (Venus, he went on to explain, was herself created from sea foam and sperm).123 In the end, the manner in which one reused the repeated matter was more important than the quality of the matter in and of itself, for as Marino was quick to point out: "Ancient statues and relics of destroyed marbles, placed in a good location and with care, give a good measure of majesty to a new building."'124 If Marino "stole" from insignificant authors of his own time, he was surely doing them a service. Vincenzo Foresti wrote in The Fraud (L'uccellatura) that while Marino could be charged with thousands of "thefts [furti]," he was able "to conceal and color them better, adorning, amplifying, and composing them" so that no one could possibly recognize them as Stigliani's words.125 In the end, Aleandri compared Stigliani's complaints to those of a foolish painter who sees his own figures everywhere in the works of better artists-and here we seem to have come around full circle again.'26 Pasticcio: Stylistic Indigestion and the New Taste for Originality Although Stigliani, like Lanfranco, believed that one author had burgled the artistic property of another, the larger intel- lectual community did not seem to agree. And, as with Lan- franco, the immediate response only demonstrated the pro- fessional jealousy, insecurity, and churlishness of the critic who dared to claim originality (or the perfect natural form of novitci) for himself. It is not immediately clear why critics came to Marino's defense. There is no question that Marino was the superior poet of the two, but even this does not really explain the vehement backlash that ensued. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that Stigliani's attack on L'Adone was pub- lished after Marino's death, and it was simply beyond the limits of acceptability to attack someone who could not de- fend himself. Or perhaps it was a sign of things to come. By the end of the seventeenth century, a new term had come into play to describe the mixed style: pasticcio. Filippo Baldinucci, for instance, claimed that "even men of good taste" who were not victim to "any passions" were unable to resist the pasticci of a certain unnamed painter.'27 Piles ex- plained that pastiche came from the Italian word for pastries: Paintings that are neither Originals, nor Copies, are called Pastiches, from the Italian pastici, which means pastries, because as the different things that flavor a dish are mixed together in order to produce a single taste [un seul goftt], so, too, all of the imitations that compose a pastiche aim to make one truth appear [une v&amp;ritW].128 If we read Baldinucci's comment against the grain, it would seem to suggest that the epistemological division between repetition and originality was already in the works, for his words imply that under normal circumstances a "man of good taste" should not be seduced by pasticci. Piles, however, did not explicitly criticize nor endorse pastiche as a practice; instead, he simply explained that the goal of the pastiche was "to produce a single taste" and "to make one truth appear." Other authors were not so generous. In REflexions sur la poesie et la peinture (Paris, 1719), L'Abbe Dubos condemned pastiches as nothing less than forgeries produced by "im- poster painters."'29 In 1771, Francesco Milizia wrote (echoing Piles's formula) that in architecture, as in painting, "pastiches are neither originals, nor copies, but composed of different parts taken from here and there."'130 The result for Milizia, however, was a confused mess without any organic unity. By the late eighteenth century, pasticcio had increasingly come to be seen as something lacking in another quality, one that would come to bear greater importance-originality. In his comments about the Salon of 1767, Denis Diderot acknowl- edged the rift that was beginning to develop between imita- tion and innovation, lamenting, "I am angry with this word pastiche," which not only had become "a mark of contempt" but also was threatening to "discourage artists from the imi- tation of the best old masters."'31 For many critics, the term "pastiche" embodied the unac- ceptable indigestibility of stylistic mixing. As with so many of the other tropes used to describe the "mixed" style, the point of reference for this type of food metaphor was Seneca's letter "On Gathering Ideas": The food we have eaten, as long as it retains its original quality and floats in our stomachs as an undiluted mass, is a burden; but it passes into tissue and blood only when it has been changed from its original form. So it is with the food which nourishes our higher nature, we should see to it that whatever we have absorbed should not be allowed to remain unchanged, or it will be no part of us. We must digest it; otherwise it will merely enter the memory and not the reasoning power.'32 According to classical theory, good imitation, like good cook- ery, involved the judicious combination of ingredients that would blend into one delicious flavor. Demonstrative repeti- tion, on the other hand, appealed to the expert who took special pleasure in identifying the separate spices in a dish. In the aftermath of the Pico-Bembo debates of the Early Renais- sance, Paolo Cortesi concluded that the digestive metaphor provided the perfect argument against eclecticism, for indi- gestion was the obvious result from the intake of too many different, rich foods.'33 Pastiche was potentially unpalatable for the man of refined tastes, but the individual who did not particularly like spicy foods was not qualified to judge for all gastronomes that spicy foods were universally bad. Marino himself confessed that his poetry aimed to please the modern taste for excitement and</page><page sequence="23">ITALIAN BAROQUE PRACTICE AND THEORY 499 novelty and was, therefore, somewhat dangerous for those critics with no taste. "This is also the style," he concluded as a final jibe at his potential critics, "which I do not deny to be according to my natural genius and which pleases me as much as it annoys you."'134 When it came to the enjoyment of art, as with food, it was ultimately a question of personal taste. Novita, like pastiche, appealed to a certain audience capable of discerning how old ingredients could be used to produce new flavors and how the same ingredients could be used to produce different flavors. Dubos, Milizia, and Diderot, among other eighteenth-cen- tury critics, rejected pastiche and eclecticism. A century ear- lier, however, attitudes were more flexible. This is not to suggest that an irreversible epistemological rupture had oc- curred after Padovanino, Domenichino, and Marino's gener- ation. As always, tastes were variable and judgments could be reversed. In the summer of 1901, for instance, Fdelicien Fagus wrote in the Revue Blanche about a "brilliant newcomer" in whom "many likely influences can be distinguished-Dela- croix, Manet (everything points to him, whose painting is a little Spanish), Monet, Van Gogh, Pissarro, Toulouse-Lau- trec, Degas, Forain, Rops." Thirteen years later, however, another critic condemned the same painter as an "imitator" who "after making pastiches of everything and finding noth- ing more to imitate, perished in his own Cubist bluff." And again in 1923, another spectator complained that "Steinlen, Lautrec, Van Gogh, Daumier, Corot, negroes, Braque, De- rain, Cezanne, Renoir, Ingres, etc. etc. etc. Puvis de Cha- vannes, neo-Italian ... these influences prove the [artist's] lack of seriousness, in terms of construction and sureness."'35 That artist-the "brilliant newcomer," "imitator," and con- summate pasticheur-was Pablo Picasso. Picasso's critics reproached him for an inability "to forge a personal style" (Fagus's words). In her own account of Picas- so's imitative practices, however, Krauss argued that "dissem- bling and mimicry" had become the "medium" of Picasso's art; pastiche was the means to that end."36 Through pastiche as demonstrative repetition, Picasso was able to make the form and content of the materials that he appropriated his own. The "work" of art was not the physical object of the painting or drawing in itself. Instead, it was realized in the confrontation of the thing repeated (that is, the image or style, figure or maniera), as in Picasso's mechanical drawings after photographs and after works by other artists, such as Auguste Renoir, and in his Return from the Baptism, after Le Nain, which was rendered by Picasso in the style of his con- temporary Georges Seurat after a painting by the French Baroque painter.'37 Krauss's reading of Picasso and pastiche resonates with her earlier comments on Levine's work. What Krauss seems to suggest about both Picasso and Levine and what I am offering in conclusion about Baroque practice and theory is that not only are originality and repetition intimately bound in the practice and theory of a certain type of artwork, but also that repetition was a necessary condition for the aesthetic quality that would later come to be understood as "originality." Gerard Genette once wrote that the components that make up the utterance "Pierre est venu hier soir, Pierre est venu hier soir, Pierre est venu hier soil' differ from each other both materially and conceptually in that their copresence and succession identify these phrases as the first, the next, and the last.138 It is in this difference-the "certain shadow" of which Seneca and Petrarch wrote-that originality and repetition are simul- taneously brought together and separated one from the other.

This beautiful license is Titian's, who has demonstrated in his marvelous Bacchanals and in other places that he is capable of beauty in [the representation of] putti.

Conoscendo la imperfettione humana essere tale, che un huomo solo non poteva da se perfettamente compire la virtui del comporre le cose grandi, producesse Vergilio, che con meraviglioso giudicio si desse a scieglier tutto il buono, che in tutti altri auttori et Greci et Latini si ritrovasse, et in uno le accogliesse, per sopporlo a gli occhi di quelli, che dopo lui devessino scrivere, come veracis- simo essempio del componimento della grandezza Heroica. Perche a quel tempo nacque Vergilio, che la Maesta Romana era in guisa cresciuta, che non potea piu oltra andare, et le cose della Poesia, sparse nella motitudine delle compositioni de gli altri, erano tali, che solo vi mancava uno, che le levasse delle tenebre, et le facesse conoscere tutte insieme raccolte et maravigliosa- mente disposte in un bellissimo corpo et me pare che Vergilio in ci6 imitasse gli eccellenti dipintori, iquali volendo formare una imagine singolare, che rappresente la donnesca bellezza, mirando tutte le belle donne, che mirar ponno: et da ciascuna togliono le parti migliori, et accoltene tante, quante lor paiono bastare a compire la Idea c'hanno nell'animo, si danno poscia a fare la conceptua figura, laquale essendo composta delle eccellenti parti di molte bellezze riesce ella non pur bella, ma eccellentissima: tale che non si trova forma humana, che in viva donna le si possa rassimigliare, tanto desiderano i nobili artefici asseguire l'ultima perfettione." 32.

Ma essendo carestia e di buoni giudici, et di belle donne, io mi servo di certa Idea, che mi viene alla mente'" ("I'm telling you, in order to paint one beautiful woman, I would need to see many beauties, assuming that you would choose the best with me. But since there is a shortage of good judges and of beautiful women, I make use of a certain Idea that comes into my mind"); and Vasari, quoted in idem, 180: "'I1l graziosissimo Raffaello da Urbino; il quale studiano le fatiche de' maestri vecchi e quelle de' moderni, prese da tutti il meglio, e fattone raccolta, arrichi l'arte della pittura di quella intera perfezione che ebbero anticamente le figure di Apelle e di Zeusi, e pi6i, se si potesse dire, o mostrare l'opere di quelli a questo paragone" (The most graceful Raphael, who, studying the works of the ancient masters and those of the modern masters, took from all of them the best. And having collected them together, enriched the art of painting with that total perfec- tion which Apelles' and Zeuxis's figures possessed in antiquity.

We should so blend those several flavours into one delicious compound that, even though it betrays its origin, yet it nevertheless is clearly a different thing from whence it came"; "Even if there shall appear in you a likeness to him who, by reason of your admiration, has left a deep impress upon you, I would have you resemble him as a child resembles his father"; "'What,' you say, 'will it not be seen whose style you are imitating, whose method of reasoning, whose pungent sayings?' I think that sometimes it is impossible for it to be seen who is being imitated, if the copy is a true one; for a true copy stamps its own form upon all the features which it has drawn from what we may call the original, in such a way that they are combined into a unity.

Son fameux tableau de SaintJer6me de la Charite que l'on regarde a present comme un des plus beaux tableaux du monde l'a rendu victime d'une injuste cabale faite par un cardinal qui protegeait d'autre peintres; il n'y avait dans Rome qu'une voix pour decrier ce chef-d'oeuvre au moment qu'il a parut, tant il est vrai que beaucoup de gens courent apres les sentiments des autres et croient ce qu'ils entendent dire plut6t que ce qui est. Je me souviens que le cavalier Bernin m'a dit dans majeunesse en voyant ce tableau qu'il demandait pardon a Dieu de n'avoir jamais os6 dans ce temps-la dire ce qu'il en pensait, de peur de se brouiller avec ce grand seigneur qui etait un de ses amis" (Domenichino had to leave Rome and Naples for having made works that were too spectacular. What a destiny! To work only to make enemies! His infamous painting in S. Girolamo della Carita, which we now see as one of the most beautiful paintings in the world, made him a victim of an unjust conspiracy led by a cardinal who protected other painters. In Rome, there was but one voice that condemned this masterpiece when it first appeared. It is true that many people follow other people's sentiments and believe what they hear rather than what is true. I recall that Bernini told me as a child that on seeing this painting he asked God's forgiveness for not daring to say what he thought at that time for fear of falling out with the great lord who was one of his friends). 103. Passeri (as in n. 16), 4: "Bench&amp; in quelle Istorie egli si servisse d'alcuna figura del Carracci della Galleria Farnese, non e per questo degno di biasmo, ne dee incolparsi di debolezza nell'invenzione, o di mancanza d'un buon ricapito: poiche in quel suo furto fece scoprire una saggia avvedutezza, che seppe valersi d'una attitudine molto a proposito per il suo bisogno, applicandola cosi adattamente. Diede puo sempre chiarissimi segni d'un profondo sapere, e di un gusto perfettissimo in tute le opere sue, riducendo le ad un fine esattissimo, che le rendeva bene stabilite, e concluse." 104. Ibid., 8. 105. Nicolas Poussin, "Osservationi di Nicol6 Pussino sopra la pittura," in Bellori, 462: "La noviti della Pittura non consiste principalmente nel soggetto non piai veduto, ma nella buona, e nuova dispositione e espressione, e cosi il soggetto dall'essere commune, e vecchio diviene singolare, e nuovo." 106. Torquato Tasso, Discorsi del Signor Torquato Tasso (Venice: G. Vasalini, 1587), 2-3: "la novita del poema non consiste principalmente in questo, ci6 che la materia sia finta e non pia udita; ma consiste ne la novita del nodo e de lo scioglimento de la favola. Fu l'argomento di Tieste, di Medea, di Edippo da vari antichi trattato; ma variamente tessendolo, di commune proprio, e di vecchio novo il facevano; si che novo sari quel poema in cui nova sara la testura dei nodi, nove le soluzioni, novi gli episodi, che per entro vi saranno traposti, ancora che la materia sia notissima, e da altri prima trattata" (novelty in poetry does not consist primarily in this, that is, that the subject matter is invented and has never been heard before; instead it consists above all in the novelty of the weaving and the development of the story. The plot of Thyestes, Medea, and Oedipus was treated by various ancient writers, but weaving the story differently with one's own agency, one makes from something old something new so that the poem in which the weaving of the threads is new, in which the solutions are new, and in which the episodes are new shall also be new. All the while they will be transposed even though the materials are well known and have been treated previously by others); on Poussin's sources, see Anthony Blunt, "Poussin's Notes on Painting," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 1 (1937-38): 344-51. 107. Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca (Venice: G. Alberti, 1612), 548- 49: "Cosa nuova, insolita, e che avviene improvvisamente." The term novit&amp;h originated in the 14th century as a term referring to "news" (an equivalent to the modern word notizie). Novith then appeared as a critical term in the Domenichino controversy and the Marinisti debates in the 1620s, and it eventually became associated with "originality" in the 18th century; see Bat- taglia (as in n. 6), vol. 11, 613-14. 108. Monsu Capellano, Discorso di Monsu' Cappellano ... Nel quale d&amp; il suo parere sopra l'Adone Poema Del Cavalier Marino (Venice: Giacomo Sarzina, 1625), 139-40: "La novita ch'b naturale, e anco di due sorti. La prima perfetta nella sua perfettione, quando una cosa non mostruosa, che non e giamai stata, &amp; viene ad apparire, come all'hora, che in un luogo, dove non mai si e vista acqua, si vede forgere in un tratto qualche fonte di acqua viva; l'altra meno perfetta e, quando in una cosa gia trovato, doppo qualche tempo si venisse a scoprire alcuna virtus particolare, della quale niuno se ne fossero accorto avanti" (There are two sorts of novelty that are natural. The first is perfect in its perfection and occurs in a nonmonstrous thing that has never existed before and has just appeared, as when one suddenly sees water rising forth in a place that has never had water before. The other type is less perfect and occurs when one reveals a particular virtue in an object, which has already been discovered for some time, but that nobody noticed before). 109. Ibid., 138-39: "Quella, che e contra natura, e di due sorti. La prima si chiamarebbe perfetta nella sua imperfettione, che e all'hora, che a un corpo d'una natura vien congiunto un'altro corpor d'un'altra natura; come si son visti de'Satiri nell'antichita, &amp; a nostri tempi de'mezzi huomini, &amp; mezzi cani, &amp; all'hora la novita e in eccesso di mostruosita. La seconda si potrebbe dire imperfetta, &amp; e quando a un corpo d'una natura si accoppia un corpo della medesima natura, senza pern unirsi, &amp; confondersi, tanto che non apparis- chino due operationi distinte, &amp; independente una dall'altra, come si son veduti de' mostri d'huomini con due testi, d'Ermafroditi, &amp; di fanciulli attaccati per la fronte; &amp; all'hora la novith S puramente mostruosa senza eccesso" (There are also two sorts of novelty that are unnatural. The first would be called perfect in its imperfection, as when one attaches a body of one nature to another body of another nature, such as the satyrs of antiquity and, in our own time, figures that are half man and half dog. Novelty in this case is excessively monstrous. The second could be called imperfect, as when a body of one nature is coupled to another body of similar nature without however completely uniting and merging the two, so that they do not seem like two distinct operations which are independent one from the other, as in the case with two-headed men, hermaphrodites, and infants joined at the head. In this case, novelty is purely monstrous without being excessive). 110. For example, Tesauro (as in n. 67), 67-68: "E di qui nasce la mara- viglia, mentre che l'animo dell'uditore, dalla novith soprafatto, considera l'acutezza dell'ingegno rappresentante e la inaspettata imagine dell'obietto rappresentato" (The marvelous is born in that moment when the spirit of the listener, of the novelty considers the wit and acuity of the thing that is doing the representing and the unexpected image of the object that is represented) and 83-84: "Per6 che un obietto rattamente illuminato dall'altro ti vibra come un lampo nell'intelletto, e la novith cagiona maraviglia, la qual e una reflessione attenta che t'imprime nella mente il concetto" (an object quickly illuminated by another shines before you like the lamp of the mind, and novelty causes marvel, which is an attentive reflection that engraves the conceit in your mind). 111. Aleandri, 65: "variandone cosi felicamente la descrittione sempre con nobile novith di frasi, e di concetti di modo che maggior diletto, e maraviglia produce, che se diverse materie trattarse." 112. Stigliani, 50-51: "Cade per reiterazione, perche non varia n&amp; nodi, ne scioglimenti, ma si serve spesso de' medesimi, sicche chi legge un caso pu6 far conto d'averne letto cinque, o sei, e di non aversi a meravigliare salvo che del primo, se quel non &amp; rubato, come quasi sempre suole essere." Contra, see Aleandri, 66-68; and Scipione Herrico, L'occhiale appanato, dialogo di S. H. nel quale si difende l'Adone del Cavalier G. B. Marino contra l'Occhiale del Cavalier T. Stigiliano (Messina: Giovanne Francesco Bianco, 1629), 21. 113. Stigliani, 27-28: "I1 vero principio doveva in questo Poema essere.... l'innamoramento d'Adone, il vero mezzo i travagli di quello, ed il vero fine il congiugnimento con Venere. ... la presente favola non sia un tutto integrale, quale dovrebbe essere s'avesse A dilettare, e quale la desiderano i predetti maestri: ma sia un tutto aggregato, il quale per so S cosa sazievolissima. I1 tutto integrale S quello, il quale componendosi distintamente di parti certe, e limite, non pu6 essere n&amp; scemato, n&amp; accresciuto, n&amp; mutato, ch'egli non si distrugga, o almeno non si danneggi." 114. Ibid., 28-30, esp. 29, on the link with painting: "E testificato simil- mente la pittura, la quale, se ben pare, ch'oggidi abbia pur qualche valente artefice ha per6 perduta affatto ancor'ella la sua scienza" (This can also be seen in painting, which has lost all its art in spite of the few good men that are around today); and 33, where Stigliani invokes Horace: "Humano capiti cervi- cem pitor equinan ... ." Aleandri, 14, responds that several artists in Rome would disagree with Stigliani's charge and that in any case "he probably knew as much about painting as he did about poetry." 115. Stigliani, 104: "quando il concetto non &amp; involato da fuori, ma nasce dalle stesse viscere. .... Puossi questa violar per ladroneccio, e cosi fa perpetu- amente l'Adone, carpendo i concetti da diversi scrittori, ma piu' spesso dalle mie Rime, e dal Mondo Nuovo." 116. Ibid., 117: "un libro di disegni stampati, nel qual non sia figura veruna, ma separati membri (cioe occhij, orecchie, braccia, gambe, e simili) fatti da' pittori per insegnare a' giovani di disegnare." Stigliani was referring to Odoardo Fialetti's 1608 manual, II vero modo et ordine per disegnar, and Giacomo Franco's 1611 De excellentia et nobilitate delineationis, both of which were illus- trated by Palma Giovane; see Sohm, 1991, 124-25; idem, "La critica d'arte del seicento: Carlo Ridolfi e Marco Boschini," in La pittura nel Veneto: Il seicento, vol. 2, ed.

Robusto Pogommega, Le strigliate a Tomaso Stigliano (Nuremberg: Jo- seph Stamphier, 1642), cxi: "Ascoltami, Stiglian da buon' amico, / Senza montar in colera e furore, / I1 tuo Mondo per me non vale un fico. / E tu pensi ritrarne oro &amp; honore. // Lo stile S basso, insipido, ed antico,/ E privo di sapere, e di sapore. 119.

Herrico (as in n. 112), 30-31: "non S biasmevole il furto, quando si prende da Poeti Latini, o Greci, e da scrittori d'altro linguaggio .... lo pren- der da gli antichi non si dice furto, ma pii) tosto imitatore." 121.

Marino, quoted in Dooley, 459; cf. Giambattista Marino, La Sampogna (Parma: Fondazione Pietro Bembo, 1993), 52: "le statue antiche et le reliquie de' marmi distrutti, poste in buon sito et colloate con bell'artificio, accress- cono ornamento et maesta alle fabriche nuove." 125.

Aleandro (Venice: Antonio Pinelli, 1630), 68: "Quanto poi appartiene a i furti del Marino, io confesso, che egli ne ha fatti pifi di millanta.... Ma non per tanto gli ha egli saputi per lo pii ben colorire, e ben celare, adornandogli, ampliandogli, e componendogli: si come appare nella favola di Filauro, e di Filora; della quale parte da Eliodoro prendendo e parte da altri, ne ha composto un tutto suo; quale etiamdio da voi Signore Stigliano non &amp; stato riconosciuto per roba d'altri." 126. Aleandri, 89-90: "E se pure s'havesse A credere, che dal Marini fosse veramente letto il Mondo nuovo; e imitatone alcuna cosa, la quere la dello Stigliano non sarebbe quella dissimile, che un goffo pittore da scabella faceva, non ha molt'anni poscia che havendo dipinto un quadro di Latona, che se ne stava co' suoi bambini presso al lago, nel quale i vilani diventan ranocchie, l'havea fatto in si bella maniera, ch'a pensa la sembianza di que' bambini da quella delle ranocchie si discerneva il che veggendo un valente nostro pittore, volle la stesa favola in altro quadro figurare; e havendolo fatto in eccellenza diede per ci6 occasione al pittore goffo d'andarsi dolendo, che l'inventione gli fosse stata rubata, e cercatosi d'offuscargli la gloria si che ne nasceva quel riso, che hora da' suoi rammarchi fa nascer lo Stigliani" (Even if we were to believe that Marino actually read the New World and imitated something from it, Stigliani's complaints would not be dissimilar to those made by a foolish painter of Scabella [a type of three-legged chair and also the name of a musical instrument worn on the foot] who made a painting of Latona with her children by the lake in which their enemies were turned into frogs. He painted this in such a "beautiful" style that one could hardly distinguish the children from the frogs. A worthy painter seeing these figures wanted to represent the same story in another painting. Having done this extremely well, it caused the foolish painter to whine that the invention had been stolen from him and that [the worthy painter] tried to steal his glory; this was so obviously silly because [the foolish painter's paintings] were unworthy and his attitude was laughable, just like Stigliani's). 127. Baldinucci, quoted in Ingeborg Hoesterey, Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 3: "Dicevano che egli era un pasticciere die quadri; ma gli uomini di buon gusto, e privo d'ogni passione non lascivano pero mai di provvedersi de' suoi pasticci." 128.

L'Abbe Dubos, quoted in Littre (as in n. 6), vol. 5, 1533: "On appelle communiment pastiches les tableaux que fait un peintre imposteur en imi- tant la main, la manihre de composer et le coloris d'un autre peintre, sous le nom duquel il veut produire son ouvrage." 130.
