<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL COMMENT THE important discoveries made near Rethymno by Dr. Spiro Marinatos, Ephor of Antiquities in Crete, disclosing for the first time the various cultural periods in Western Crete, have been followed by significant discoveries near Knossos. Here Dr. Marinatos believes he has identified the harbor-town of Knossos. It lies near the modern Krateros, seven kilometres east of Candia, and is thought to be the site of ancient Amnisos, according to evidence found in Strabo. Large, squared blocks of poros-an imported stone-some bearing the sign of the double axe, indicate structures of importance, perhaps a light-house and a palace or official building of Courtesy of the Excavator, Dr. Marinatos, Ephor of Antiquities, Crete FIG. 1.--ANISOS, CRETE, THE HARBOR-TowN OF KNossos. TO THE LEFT, THE ROCK OF PALAIOCHORA some sort. No artificial harbor existed at this point but a broad sandy beach protected by the rock of Palaiochora which rises in the background (Fig. 1)*. Pottery of all the Minoan periods was discovered here but especially from the Late Minoan Age. On the eastern side of Palaiochora, fragments of wall-paintings came to light. The floral style is in the ascendency (Fig. Q). Fragments depicting lilies in green and red are shown here in restoration. The most interesting fragment, 65 cm. high, pictures white and blue lilies in a red background (Fig. 3). The technique of this fresco is unusual. The design is sunk into the red background. In the depressions cut out to form the flowers, white or blue paste was poured.

It corresponds to the "Daedalid" inlays in the famous dagger-blades found at Mycenae. Corinth is gradually emerging as a center of the bronze industry in the Seventh and Sixth Centuries B.c. The important ex- cavations by Payne at Perachora near Corinth have brought to light not only beautiful bronze vessels, such as oinochoai with silver rivets, cups and skyphoi so often copied in clay (Fig. 4), but also ex- tremely fine bronzes, such as sphinxes, Nikes, gorgons, lions, etc. (Fig. 5). We may now add to this splendid group the unusually beautiful Greek bronzes found recently in some unplundered graves at Trebenishte in Central Macedonia. Some of the finest Greek bronzes in existence have been discovered here. They include volute kraters of superb workmanship with anthropomorphic handles; lekythoi, am- phorae and skyphoi (Fig. 6). They were doubtless made for local Princes who were wealthy enough to command the best that Greek artists could produce. These warriors were buried with face-masks, breast-plates, sandals and hand-covers of gold; with silver drinking-horns and beakers; with many bronze vessels, such as those described, and with bronze hel- mets of Illyrian type with square sections cut out in front. Casson is possibly right in his suggestion that My- cenae and Trebenishte are two phases of one culture to judge from the face- masks, ornamental pat- terns and other details. We have known little of Corinthian bronze work except what we could gather from literature: the beautiful patina possessed by bronzes made at Cor- inth and the fact that the Roman soldiers robbed Corinthian graves of their bronzes and sold them in Courtesy of Dr. Marinatos, Ephor of Antiquities, Crete FIG. 3.-AMNISOS, CRETE.

Perachora definitely increases our knowledge of Corinthian bronze work and since the weight of evidence for the origin of the Trebenishte bronzes inclines to Corinth, these should also be regarded as adding to our knowl- edge of the subject. Corinthian are the heraldic lions, the sphinxes, flying birds, FIG. 6.-VOLUTE-HANDLED KRATER FROM TREBENISHTE WITH DETAILS OF HANDLE gorgons, goats and many decorative elements. Most of these objects date from 550 to 500 B.c. and give us a new conception of the artistic quality of Corinthian bronzes (Fig. 7). Excavations in Cyprus have produced interesting results at centers like Vounous and Lapithos. Prominent among the discoveries at Vounous were a Palace and many unusual ritualistic vases with plastic figures. Some of the most important FIG. 7.-RIDER ON VOLUTE-HANDLED KRATER AND SILVER BEAKER, TREBENISHTE scenes on the vases present analogies to Minoan ritual and suggest survival of cult practices.
