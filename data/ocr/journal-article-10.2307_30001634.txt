<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Irish Archaeology 111, 1985/6 MEGALITHS AND MEGALOMANIA: AN ACCOUNT, AND INTERPRETATION, OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PASSAGE TOMBS IN IRELAND ALISON SHERIDAN ABSTRACT The paper sets forth a proposed new scheme for the development of Irish passage tombs, and discusses the information that can be derived from it concerning the nature, distribution and expression of power in neolithic Ireland. INTRODUCTION In their attempts to reconstruct prehistoric social organi- sation, archaeologists have frequently turned to funerary monuments for clues concerning the nature and distribution of power in the communities under study. The neolithic commu- nal tombs of Britain have proved a particularly rich source for such interpretations. The segmented chamber plan and spatial distribution of long barrows have, for example, been regarded as indicators of a lineage-based, egalitarian society; whilst the emergence of a hierarchy in the scale of funerary and other ceremonial monuments has been taken to signify hierarchical social organisation (Fleming 1972, 1973: Renfrew 1976, 1981). Irish megalithic tombs have also been the subject of such investigations, and in recent publications it has been suggested that court tombs are the product of egalitarian communities, whereas passage tombs were constructed by members of centralised chiefdoms (Darvill 1979: Renfrew 1981). The aim of this contribution is to present a critical evaluation of the existing interpretations of the Irish passage tomb data, and to offer in their place a more satisfactory model. In addressing itself to the questions of how, and how closely, the social order may be represented in funerary monuments, this paper will suggest that the process of passage tomb devel- opment may well be related to a process of change in the distribution and nature of power in neolithic Ireland. The paper is divided into two parts. The first deals with the chronological sequence of Irish passage tomb developments, reviewing the current versions and presenting a proposed new scheme. An attempt is then made, in the second, to interpret the hypothetical changes in tomb design, size and contents as outlined in this scheme. PART 1: THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH PASSAGE TOMBS The problem of reconstructing the developmental sequence of Irish passage tombs has long taxed archaeologists, and some would argue that the task is still impossible, given the paucity of chronological information. Whilst acknowledging the seri- ous difficulties of tomb dating, one can nevertheless argue that it is possible, using the currently-available evidence of radiocarbon dates, stratigraphy and multi-phase monuments, to challenge the existing versions, and to propose in their place a more plausible alternative. The existing versions In 1974, Michael Herity set forth the view that the practice of passage tomb construction was introduced to Ireland by metal- seeking colonists from the Morbihan area of Brittany around 2500 bc (i.e. ca 3100 CAL-BC).' This immigrant community, he argued, was responsible for the implantation of a variety of passage tomb forms, from the complex-plan transeptal tombs as seen in every major Irish cemetery, to the simpler 'angled' forms (e.g. Carrowkeel cairn H) arid the simplest chamber- and-passage arrangement as seen, for example, at Knocklea. Having established the major cemeteries of the Boyne Valley, splinter groups of settlers then set off northwards and westwards to construct the cemeteries at Loughcrew and Carrowkeel. By the time their descendants reached the west coast at Sligo, the art of passage tomb building had gone into decline, reaching its nadir with the construction of the simple, polygonal, boulder-built tombs of the Carrowmore cemetery. These supposedly represent an insular version of the simpler form of Breton prototype. The idea that passage tombs belong to the period 2500- 2000 bc/3100-2450 CAL-BC was taken up by Darvill (1979), who proposed an indigenous model of their origins, arguing that they were constructed by the descendants of court tomb builders. He explained the radical transformation in tomb design, location, and associated funerary rituals in terms of social change, in which an egalitarian, lineage-based society was transformed, around 2500 bc/3100 CAL-BC, into a chiefdom-based hierarchical society. A third alternative has since been presented by Burenhult (1980a,b, 1981, 1984). In this, he reversed Herity's complex- to-simple developmental sequence and argued that the simple, boulder-built tombs of the Carrowmore cemetery began to be erected during the early fourth millennium bc (i.e. ca 4600 CAL-BC). Burenhult argued that the builders of these tombs were small, mobile groups of indigenous hunter-gatherer- fishers, and rested his case on: (i) a radiocarbon date of 3800 Â± 85 bc/4840-4370 CAL-BC (Lu-1840), supposedly relating to the construction of Carrowmore tomb 4; (ii) the absence of pottery from most of the tombs, thereby supposedly indicating a pre-ceramic society; and (iii) the presence of sea shells in many of the tombs, thus linking them with the nearby coastal shell middens and suggesting (to Burenhult) a non-agricultural economy. There are many reasons why these three models are unsatis- factory. In Herity's, for example, even though he rightly draws attention to the close parallels between Ireland and Brittany in passage tomb design and (some) pendant miniatures, he never adequately accounts for the equally important differences - such as why other grave goods characteristic of one area (e.g. Irish pins and balls) are not also regularly found in the other. Moreover, although he claims close similarities between the megalithic art of the two regions, a recent comprehensive study (Shee-Twohig 1981) has suggested that, with very few exceptions, the styles of Irish and Breton art are in fact quite different. Furthermore, there is radiocarbon dating evidence (albeit controversial) from the Carrowmore cemetery which suggests that the simple boulder-built monuments belong to the beginning, not the end, of the developmental sequence. As for Darvill's version, the credibility of his arguments relies entirely on the reader's acceptance of the suggestion that rapid and total changes could take place in social organisation and funerary traditions. Whilst such a transformation is of course not impossible - and doubtless ethnohistoric or archaeological examples of it could be found - nevertheless Darvill fails to offer any convincing evidence to support his claim or explain the supposed changes. Moreover, his asser- tion that passage tomb building did not commence in Ireland until ca 2500 bc/3100 CAL-BC has been brought into question by the radiocarbon dating evidence from Carrowmore (see below), which suggests that some simple passage tombs may have been constructed as early as ca 3000 bc/3800 CAL-BC. If this was so, then a considerable period of overlap with court tomb building can be envisaged. Burenhult's model has already been debated at length elsewhere (e.g. Burenhult 1984: Caulfield 1983), so will be dealt with only briefly here. I would agree with the consensus opinion that the early date from tomb 4 should be discounted as unreliable, and that there is no evidence to support Burenhult's view of an indigenous mesolithic origin for passage tomb construction in Ireland. Nevertheless, I would concur with Burenhult's overall conclu- 17</page><page sequence="2">9~s o ~t~L.

The proposed new version As suggested above, the currently-available evidence allows for a fourth, arguably more plausible account of Irish passage tomb origins and development to be proposed. Like the others, it can only be regarded as a provisional, tentative working hypothesis, subject to revision or eventual rejection. Nevertheless, it is felt that its creation is worthwhile, for two reasons. Firstly, it fits the available evidence better than its predecessors; and secondly, as an exercise in model-building, it draws a coherent picture from a confusing mass of evidence, and suggests directions for further debate and research. The model is presented as a six-stage developmental scheme, with each hypothetical stage being defined by a set of criteria relating to tomb size, complexity of design, elaboration (both structural and non-structural), and contents. Although the model implies some degree of chronological succession, the dating of the stages is necessarily 'fuzzy'. This is due not only to the paucity and problematic nature of our dating evidence, but also to the fact that the model allows for the chronological overlapping of different stages. Bearing in mind its provisional, hypothetical and unashamedly subjective nature, the scheme is presented as follows: Stage 1 (estimated date: first quarter of the third millennium bc/3800-3400 CAL-BC) Construction of simple polygonal, figure-of-eight and cruci- form chambers within a kerb circle, the whole usually boulder- built (Fig. 1). It is unclear whether all, or just some of these tombs had covering mounds; where none is present, it is virtually impossible to prove whether one had previously existed. The diameter of the kerb circles is generally small, most examples being of the order of 10-15m. A few are larger, ranging between 16-23m., and although these tend to be associated with cruciform chambers, simple polygonal and figure-of-eight chambers are also represented. Passages are absent, rudimentary or short, and may in some cases have been set asymmetrically to the chamber (e.g. at Carrowmore tomb 7). Although generally sparse, the goods accompanying cre- mation deposits comprise bone and antler pins, stone balls, beads and pendants, rock crystals, small flint artifacts, 'Carrowkeel' pottery and, in Carrowmore tomb 27, rings of whale ivory. However, since the chambers may have been used over long periods for successive interments, it is impossible to determine exactly when these grave goods first began to be used. The distribution of these tombs shows a marked tendency for location in or near coastal areas. Although the largest concentration is found in the Carrowmore cemetery, at least one example (cairn 0), and possibly two others (cairns M and N), occur at Carrowkeel, Co. Sligo, possibly representing an early stage in this cemetery's existence. The dating of these monuments currently rests on four radiocarbon determinations thought to relate to the construc- tion of tombs 7 and 27 at Carrowmore, and a fifth, controver- sial date from tomb 4 in the same cemetery (Burenhult 1980a,b, 1984). Tomb 7, a simple polygonal chamber set asymmetrically to a short passage within a kerb of 12.5m. diameter, has a date of 3290 + 80 bc/4320-3820 CAL-BC (Lu-1441) for charcoal from a central post, supposedly invol- ved in its construction; and tomb 27, a cruciform chamber inside a kerb of 23m. diameter, has dates of 3090 Â± 60 bc/3990-3700 CAL-BC, 3050 + 65 bc/3970-3650 CAL-BC and 2990 + 85 bc/3960-3530 CAL-BC (Lu-1698, 1808, 1810) for charcoal in the central chamber's stone packing. The now- notorious and generally discounted date from tomb 4 has already been mentioned. Whilst a construction date of ca 3800 bc/4600 CAL-BC cannot be ruled out - since, after all, simple passage tombs have supposedly been dated to a similarly early period in Iberia, Brittany and west-central France - nev- ertheless, many more determinations from primary contexts in tomb 4 would be needed to prove that the dated charcoal does not derive from redeposited, pre-tomb material. How reliable, then, are the other abovementioned Carrow- more dates? The date for tomb 7 should be regarded strictly as a terminus post quem, and treated with the caution normally associated with a single determination. As for the three broadly contemporary dates from tomb 27, these could concei- vably belong to ancient charcoal accidentally incorporated into the tomb during its construction. Nevertheless, it is still poss- ible that Burenhult's interpretation is correct, and that they indicate that the tombs were constructed around 3000 bc/3800 CAL-BC. Only further dating will resolve this issue. As for the tombs' origins, there is currently no hard evidence to support the view that they are the product of indigenous mesolithic communities. Similarly, the idea that some coastal neolithic communities chose to change from court tomb to passage tomb building around 3000 bc/3800 CAL-BC has no factual support. Some clues may, however, emerge from a closer study of similar monuments which are scattered along the western seaboard of Britain, some of which were discussed by Lynch in 1975 (Fig. 2). These in turn can be compared with some of the early passage tombs of north-west and west-central France which show a similar coastal distribution; and one might be tempted to consider a model of northward seaborne diffusion from France during the fourth millennium bc (i.e. fifth millennium CAL-BC). Further encouragement to this view might be given by the following observations: (i) the plain bowl found at Carreg Samson, Pembrokeshire, can be parallelled in the 'Carn' and 'Cous' pottery of fifth and early fourth millennium CAL-BC date, which is regularly associated with simple passage tombs in north- west and west-central France (e.g. at lie Gaignog: Lynch 1975: L'Helgouach 1976, 367, Fig. 1.5); (ii) the decorated shouldered bowl from Achnacreebeag, Argyll, has general affinities with the 'Channelled ware' of north-west France (which is thought to have been in use between ca 3100-2500 bc/ca 3950-3050 CAL-BC), and can be parallelled quite closely with a bowl from a similar- shaped tomb at Vierville, Normandy (Ritchie 1970, 40, Fig. 3.2: Verron 1976, 392, Fig. 2.7). The facts that: (i) no such pottery has yet been found in any of the Irish simple passage tombs, and (ii) none of the French 'prototypes' has produced 'Carrowkeel' pottery or other Irish- type grave goods, need not invalidate the suggestion of a possible French origin for the Irish tombs. If, as suggested above, the latter were used over a considerable period, then it could well be that the specifically 'Irish' grave goods represent a secondary development within Ireland. This diffusionist model has other weaknesses, however. Apart from being terribly dtmode, it begs the question of how and why the spread from France took place. If one envisages small but growing maritime communities plying the Atlantic waters and settling in coastal areas deemed to be suitable, then why are there no simple passage tombs around the south-east or south-west coast of Ireland, where plenty of good landfall sites are available? Furthermore, how is one to explain the apparent absence of boulder kerbs from non-Irish simple tombs? The questions are presently unanswerable; the sugges- tion of a French origin is simply set forth here as a possibility to be considered. Stage 2 (estimated dates: ca 2800 bc - ?ca 2500 bc/ca 3600- 3050 CAL-BC) This stage marks the spread of passage tomb building to other areas: the first tombs in the Boyne Valley cemeteries, and probably also those at Loughcrew and elsewhere, can arguably be assigned to it (Fig. 3). In terms of tomb design and size, a substantial degree of continuity from the previous Stage is evident: indeed, in some cases (e.g. Carrowkeel cairns M and N), it is impossible to determine whether a tomb should be ascribed to Stage 1 or Stage 2. The variant consisting of a 19</page><page sequence="4">u. Q- 6.o rr O.

The asymmetric arrangement of passage and chamber noted in some Stage 1 tombs is also frequently found: examples include Knowth site 14, and the phase 1 structure at Newgrange site K. Another variant, the cruciform chamber with short passage, continues to be employed as well (e.g. at Knowth site 6); and a novel type, the long, roughly rectangu- lar, passageless chamber, is seen at Knowth site 3. All of these tombs are thought to have had covering mounds. The diameter of the surrounding kerb - whose circular shape is frequently flattened at the tomb's entrance - is generally of the order of 8-15m. (There are some examples whose kerbs have a diameter of 20m. or more, but these have been assigned to a 'later' Stage of tomb-building on account of their size.) As for the grave goods accompanying the cremation burials, it is again impossible to determine at what point in the tombs' usage they were deposited. These artifacts comprise beads, pendants, balls, pins, 'Carrowkeel' pottery, small chalk lumps, one flint blade and a bone 'scoop'. A particularly fine, decorated 'pin' of antler or bone was found in Knowth site 3; this has a close parallel in an antler 'pin' from Fourknocks 1, and the incised decoration is reminiscent of that found on pendants from Carrowmore tomb 27, Carrowkeel cairn G, and Loughcrew cairns R2 and S. Such parallels suggest a Stage 3-5 'date' for this artifact. One feature which is characteristic of some of these tombs, but absent from Stage 1 examples, is a degree of elaboration shown in: (i) the presence of incised decoration on structural stones; (ii) the presence of a basin stone - used as a receptacle for burial deposits - at Loughcrew cairn W. The megalithic art, which Shee-Twohig refers to as 'Loughcrew style' decoration, is known from sites in the east of Ireland (e.g. Loughcrew cairn R2, Knowth site 8). That the decoration is probably a primary feature is demonstrated by its occasional presence on parts of the stone which would have been inacces- sible after the tomb's construction (e.g. at Knowth site 8). Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell whether these particular tombs were built before, or contemporaneously with, the Stage 3 monuments which share these features. As for the date of these tombs, direct and indirect radiocar- bon dating evidence can be used in a few cases. At Townleyhall II, an occupation episode, thought by the excavator to have occurred shortly before the construction of the undifferen- tiated passage tomb, was dated to 2730 Â± 150 bc/3780-2920 CAL-BC (BM-170: Barker and Mackey 1968, 4). At Knowth, a general terminus post quem for the cemetery is given by the date of 2902 Â± 71 bc/3780-3380 CAL-BC (BM-1076) for charcoal underlying site 8, deriving from occupation of the area by users of 'Western Neolithic' pottery; and it is likely that the dates of 2925 Â± 150 bc/3990-3340 CAL-BC and 2845 + 185 bc/3980-3030 CAL-BC (UB-318-9), from charcoal in the dark soil underlying site 17, also relate to this phase of activity (Burleigh et al. 1976, 34: Eogan 1984: Smith etal. 1971,452-3). It is possible that a similar occupation phase at nearby New- grange, also pre-dating the construction of passage tombs, was contemporary. A date of 2449 + 67 bc/3330-2790 CAL-BC (BM-1078) was obtained from the mound of site 16 at Knowth, and incidentally also gives a terminus post quem for the con- struction of the huge mound of site 1, since it is partly overlain by it (Burleigh et al. 1976, 34: Eogan 1984). Finally, Knowth site 3 has a terminus ante quem of 2208 + 126 bc/3030-2400 CAL-BC (BM-785), derived from site 2 which is superimposed on it (Burleigh et al. 1976, 33). Other types of evidence can be used to augment the infor- mation obtained from radiocarbon dating. The fact that many of the small tombs at Knowth appear to be placed uncomfort- ably close to the massive mound of site 1, often with their entrances facing its kerb, suggests that they are likely to pre-date it. Indeed, the site 1 kerb appears to respect that of site 13, and possibly also that of site 14. In addition, the evidence from multi-phase monuments suggests that the 'undifferentiated' type of passage tomb is of potentially early date: this form occurs as the primary structure at Newgrange site K, Carrowkeel cairn H and Duntryleague. Finally, one may note the apparently close similarities bet- ween 'undifferentiated' passage tombs in Ireland and certain possibly contemporary Breton tombs, most notably Butten-er- Hah (chamber H). Whether this similarity is due to continuing contact with the hypothetical area of origin of Irish passage tombs, or simply to chance, may be impossible to determine. However, it may be worth noting that a sharing of tomb plans was not accompanied by the exact copying of megalithic art styles. Stage 3 (estimated date: second quarter of third millennium bc/ca 3500-3050 CAL-BC) Because of the shortage of chronological information, the developments of Stages 3 and 4 must remain entirely specula- tive. It is envisaged, however, that the period between ca 2750-2500 bc/3500-3050 CAL-BC saw an escalation in the scale and complexity of tomb building, in which many of the features found in the 'later', massive monuments began to appear. One might postulate that Stage 3 marks the erection of the 'middle-sized' tombs in the major cemeteries of Loughcrew, Carrowkeel and the Boyne Valley: that is, at Loughcrew, the cairns with kerb diameters between 11-20m.; at Carrowkeel, between 18-23m.; and, in the Boyne Valley, Newgrange sites L and K (phase 2), and probably many of the Dowth so-called 'satellite' tombs (Fig. 4). Knowth sites 4, 12 and 15, with their kerb diameters of 14.7, 17 and ca 18.5m and their generalised resemblance to Newgrange site K, could also belong to this Stage. The slightly smaller, cruciform site 17 at Knowth may also tentatively be ascribed to this Stage; it is clear, at least, that it post-dates site 18 (Eogan 1984). As for possible Stage 3 representatives elsewhere, it is tempting to seek examples amongst the numerous tombs with kerb diameters between 15-25m., such as the phase 2 cruciform tomb at Duntryleague (22m.), or the decorated, simple-plan tombs at Sess Kilgreen (22m.) and Knockmany (25m.). However, using kerb diameter as a chronological indicator can be risky, since at least two tombs within the 15-25m. range show signs of belonging to Stage 6 (Knowth site 2 and Newgrange site Z), and another, Fourknocks I, contains a particular style of megalithic art which suggests probable contemporaneity with the Stage 5 monuments at Newgrange and Knowth. If discussion is limited to the major cemeteries mentioned above, the following suggestions can be offered (see Fig. 4). The 'undifferentiated' tomb form continues to be constructed, but is associated with a larger mound than before (e.g. at Carrowkeel cairn B), and may also have a longer passage, as at Newgrange site K, phase 2. (The small triangular 'annexe' at Carrowkeel cairn B need not be a new feature: a similar structure already existed in the phase 1 tomb at Newgrange site K.) Cruciform chambers continue to be used as well, in larger mounds and with longer passages; and for the first time there is clear evidence for the construction of corbelled roofing (e.g. at Carrowkeel cairn G). In addition, a new form of complex segmented chamber appears, as shown in Loughcrew cairns I,S,U and V. 21</page><page sequence="6">0. ,: . . 4 ,_ Packing stones -- ... . for removed Turf mound kirk , -. .. ... ........ .. ... .. ... .. .. .

Other, novel forms of elaboration occur as well. At Loughcrew cairn V, a tall orthostat was erected outside the kerb, near the passage entrance, and at its base was a long rounded white sea pebble. A Stage 5 parallel for the orthostat is known from outside the entrance to Knowth site 1 (west), and a possible parallel for the pebble can be cited in the 'phallic' sandstone object found lying within an oval stone setting outside Newgrange main tomb. A further parallel, again with obvious phallic connotations, is the 'fash- ioned stone' found near the entrance to Knowth site 12 (Eogan 1984, 164); and at the entrance to Knowth site 4 there is an echo of the Newgrange stone setting. Another feature for which a Stage 5 parallel can be found is the presence of a curiously shaped stone, or 'concoid', outside the entrance to Newgrange site K (cf. Knowth site 1 (west) and Newgrange main mound). However, one cannot be certain that this stone does not represent a later addition to the tomb. Finally, it has been suggested that many of these tombs may have had a peculiar structural feature known as a 'roof slot' - a possible forerunner of the Newgrange main mound's 'roof box' - located at the outer end of the lintelled part of the passage (Fig. 5: Lynch 1973: O'Kelly et al. 1978). Lynch has suggested that the function of this structure was to allow ritual communi- cation with the tomb's contents after sealing of the outer part of the passage; however, in the light of discoveries concerning the Newgrange 'roof box', a more specific astronomical/ calendrical function might also be considered. Regarding the grave goods deposited with the cremations, a similar range to that noted for Stage 1 and 2 examples has been found. One type of exotic find is represented by the three pendant miniatures of Breton haches a bouton, found in Carrowkeel cairn G. (The nature and possible provenance of stone grave goods will be discussed later.) As for the tombs' dating, the evidence is, as mentioned before, extremely sparse; it rests largely on: (i) O'Kelly et al.'s contention (1978, 343) that tombs K and L were erected prior to the main mound at Newgrange (i.e. before ca 2500 bc/3100 CAL-BC); and (ii) close similarities in design with the transep- ted tombs of the Morbihan region of Brittany, which are thought to belong to the first half of the third millennium bc (i.e. ca 3800-3050 CAL-BC. L'Helgouach 1973: Shee-Twohig 1981, 49-50). Again, the close parallels with Brittany suggest contacts between the two areas, although it cannot be determined whether this represents a pooling of ideas about tomb design, or deliberate copying of Breton prototypes by Irish builders (or indeed vice versa). Once more, it is not possible to draw exact parallels between the megalithic art of the two areas (but see below regarding the apparent connections with Petit Mont); in fact, many of the Breton transepted tombs are like the Carrowkeel examples in having no decoration. Stage 4 (estimated date: second quarter of third millennium bc, possibly shortly before ca 2500 bc/ca 3500-3050 CAL-BC) According to the hypothetical sequence, Stage 4 marks the construction of the next generation of tombs, with mound diameters ranging between 26-50m. Included in this group are Loughcrew cairns L, T and Y, Carrowkeel cairns F and H (phase 2), and, in the Carrowmore necropolis, the tomb with cruciform chamber on Knocknarea (30m. diameter) and the Listoghil tomb. Other examples within this size range, whose chamber forms can be reconstructed reliably, are at Knocklea, Slieve Gullion and Seefin; in addition, there are 20 mounds scattered around Ireland whose interior plans are unclear, not yet uncovered or destroyed. The distribution and mound sizes of all these tombs, together with illustrations of chamber form (where known), are shown in Fig. 6. As with previous developments, the change from Stage 3 to Stage 4 consists mainly of a scaling-up and elaboration of existing tomb designs. The variant consisting of a simple-plan chamber and passage is seen again, in 'undifferentiated' form at Listoghil and Carrowkeel cairn H (phase 2), and in 'dif- ferentiated' form at Knocklea. The cruciform and more complex transepted chambers also continue to be constructed, as shown for example at Loughcrew cairn T and Carrowkeel cairn F. A novel feature, seen at Carrowkeel cairn H and Seefin and discussed further below, is the presence of a mark- edly angular passage. (Although 'earlier' tombs with slightly angled passages are known, for instance at Newgrange site K, the feature is far less prominent than in these examples.) Most of the forms of elaboration noted for the previous Stage - the presence of megalithic art, stone basins and roof slots - are also found in many of these tombs. At least three other forms are found as well, namely: (i) a free-standing pillar inside the chamber at Carrowkeel cairn F, analogous to one supposedly found inside the main tomb at Newgrange, and to others from Anglesey (Bryn celli ddu) and Brittany (Mand-Bras); (ii) a quartz wall facing inside the kerb at Loughcrew cairns L and T, analogous to features found in the Stage 5 Boyne Valley tombs, and supposedly constructed using pebbles imported from over 80km. away; (iii) an oval stone setting outside the entrance to Loughcrew cairn T, again analogous to examples in the Boyne Valley. The selection of grave goods from these tombs is fairly sparse - almost certainly as a result of looting - but is generally typical of the range already observed: balls, pins, and 'Carrowkeel' pottery. An atypical find is the polished kite- shaped javelinhead supposedly from Listoghil: such an item is generally associated with court tombs and users of 'Western Neolithic' pottery, and its possible presence in a passage tomb adds to the small but significant body of evidence for contact between passage tomb users and court tomb users in north- west Ireland.3 The dating of these tombs relies exclusively on analogy with the Breton sequence, which itself is woefully short of radiocar- bon dates. It is quite possible that the interval between the construction dates of Stage 4 and Stage 5 tombs was short, or even non-existent; it is even possible that some of these tombs were built as a response to the massive constructions of Stage 5. The question will only be resolved (if at all) through a programme of absolute dating. Nevertheless, the Breton analogues are all of types thought to be in use between ca 2750-2450 bc/3500-2950 CAL-BC. The parallels with tombs of the Morbihan area of Brittany are, if anything, even closer and more numerous than before: apart from the similarities between transepted tombs, already discussed under 'Stage 3', one can identify analogues for the 'angled' variant in the allees couvertes coudees, such as Mand- bihan. There is a radiocarbon date of 2480 Â± 140 bc/3510-2620 CAL-BC (Gif-1148) for one of these tombs at Gavres (Shee- Twohig 1981, 52). Moreover, the simple 'differentiated' tomb of Knocklea bears a remarkably close resemblance to the tombs at Kercado and Petit Mont, down to the funnel-shaped entrance (which could conceivably indicate the former presence of a roof slot), the asymmetrically-placed chamber, and - in the case of Kercado - the mound diameter. And finally, although the exact shape of the passage at Listoghil is unknown, it is quite likely that the tomb could have been of the form found at Man6-Kerioned B and Gavrinis. As for parallels in megalithic art, it is possible to see a resemblance between the so-called 'Loughcrew' style of Ire- land and the decoration at Petit Mont. However, the 'Loughcrew'-type features at Petit Mont appear to be alien to the Breton style, and it is possible that they were copied from Ireland. (Incidentally, the same features are also found on a small number of passage tombs from north-west Iberia, e.g. at Carapito.) Stage 5 (estimated date: ca 2500-2400 bc/ca 3100-2900 CAL-BC) This Stage sees the zenith of passage tomb construction, in which the massive monuments with kerb diameters between 23</page><page sequence="8">* . 0 . . * *0 .

Although the Boyne Valley tombs (Knowth site 1, Dowth and Newgrange) are the biggest and best known, there are in fact six others with diameters over 50m., as shown on Fig. 7. The only available information concerning the latter is an antiquarian account of a probably cruciform, decorated tomb at Donaghanie, Co. Tyrone. As for the possibility that smaller tombs were also being built at this Stage, the strongest evidence comes from Fourknocks I, in which some stones bear the same style of decoration - the so-called 'Official Art' or 'Fourknocks style' - as is found in the Boyne Valley. As to other possible contemporaries, however, one can only speculate. The significance of these massive tombs is clear. Quite simply, they were designed to be the largest, most elaborate and most 'expensive' monuments ever built. In terms of kerb diameter alone, the three Boyne Valley tombs are between ca 3-6 times as large as any other tomb in their respective clusters; when translated into cairn volume, and the work-hours required for their construction, the 'quantum leap' is even more impressive. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the difference between these tombs and the ones which arguably precede them in Stage 4 is essentially one of degree, rather than kind. As seems to have been the case throughout the developmental sequence, these represent scaled-up, more elaborate versions of pre-existing passage tomb forms: there are, for example, numerous plausible prototypes for the cruci- form chamber plan of Dowth, Knowth site 1 (east) and New- grange, and it can also be argued that the 'angled' form of Knowth site 1 (west) was already in use in Ireland. As for details of monument elaboration, since a full account would require more space than is available here, and since most of the information has already been published (e.g. O'Kelly 1982), the following summary is offered: -quartz/quartz and granite wall facing around the tomb entrance: this feature, already noted at Loughcrew cairns L and T, occurs at all three Boyne tombs; as at Loughcrew, it is reckoned that the quartz would have been imported, probably from 70km. away. -other entrance features: besides the Newgrange 'roof box', several of the features already noticed elsewhere are present at these tombs: the oval stone settings, concoids and ?phallic objects outside Newgrange and Knowth site 1 (east and west), and a standing stone outside the latter tombs. Some of these features appear to have parallels in the passage tomb cemeter- ies of south-west and south-east Iberia, for which a date in the middle and second half of the third millennium be (i.e. ca 3100-2450 CAL-BC) can be postulated (Chapman 1976). The Newgrange sandstone 'phallus' has at least one parallel in a south-west Iberian passage tomb (Leisner 1965, table 60, no.27); and Eogan has suggested that two of the larger con- coids at Knowth site 1 (west) resemble the baetyls found close to the entrances of some of the Los Millares tombs. Further evidence for possible Iberian links will be discussed below. -the Newgrange 'roof box', and other features of possible astronomical significance: the 'roof box' at Newgrange repre- sents a more substantial version of the roof slot seen else- where, and has been shown to have a specific astronomical significance. The fact that it allows the sun's rays to illuminate the chamber at sunrise on midwinter solstice not only implies a considerable degree of pre-planning by the tomb's designers, but also suggests that the tomb may have been used as a calendrical marker. Many other features of astronomical/ calendrical significance have also been claimed to exist. Dr. J. Patrick's study of the overall arrangement of monuments in the Boyne Valley concludes that "the evidence suggests but does not prove that a geometrical/astronomical design was used" to fix their positions (Patrick, in O'Kelly 1982, 84). Brennan (1983) has taken the argument much further (and has applied it to 'earlier' tombs as well), claiming that an astronomical/ calendrical function can be detected in the orientation of tombs, the positioning of standing stones (acting as shadow- markers), and the nature of megalithic art. These ideas are discussed further in Part 2. -free-standing pillar stone and ?baetyl inside Newgrange chamber: as mentioned before, the former has parallels else- where in Ireland, in Anglesey and in Brittany. The latter - now lost - was described as a large conical stone object, 45 cm. long, found under a basin in the east recess. If it genuinely was a baetyl, it invites comparison with similar features associ- ated with southern Iberian passage tombs (see above). -stone basins: once more demonstrating the continuation of a pre-existing tradition, the examples from Newgrange and Knowth nevertheless represent a superior version: not just well made, the Newgrange example was also manufactured from Co. Down granite, probably imported4; and one of the Knowth examples was extensively decorated. -megalithic art: a distinctive style (or set of styles) is associ- ated with these tombs. This shares some motifs with the 'Loughcrew style' but is technically and compositionally dif- ferent, and probably represents a much greater input of work- hours per stone. The fact that many of the specimens of this style are superimposed on, or executed on the back of, exam- ples of the simpler 'Loughcrew style' need not imply - as has often been suggested - the presence of unskilled apprentices. A more plausible explanation for this is that the stones of a pre-existing monument had been reused. At Newgrange, a small passage tomb possibly dating to 2530 Â± 60 bc/3360-2920 CAL-BC (GrN-9057: O'Kelly 1982, 230-1) could well have been dismantled before being incorporated into the main mound; and at Knowth, might one tentatively suggest that the angled passage may have been grafted on to an earlier 'undif- ferentiated' tomb, which had been decorated in the same way as the other small Knowth tombs? As for possible foreign parallels for this 'Official Art', it does appear that the so-called 'anthropomorphic' stele (B) at Knowth site 1 (west) represents a motif commonly found on Breton angled passage tombs; and one can indeed see elements of the Boyne style in the baroque decoration of Gavrinis (and indeed on isolated Orcadian examples). Nevertheless, as Shee-Twohig stresses, the styles of Ireland and Brittany are otherwise quite distinct. Regarding the grave goods and other artifacts found in these monuments, a similar emphasis on exotic and 'cultic' items can be detected. Not only are the familiar beads, balls, pendant miniatures, pins, flint flakes and bone scoop present, but also full-sized examples of ceremonial maceheads, both plain and decorated (Eogan 1983: Eogan and Richardson 1982: Herity 1974, 129: O'Kelly 1982). The latter appear to have been used widely as a probable status symbol in late neolithic Britain - not as metalworking tools, as Herity suggests - and may well have been items of specialist manufacture (Roe 1968). In addition to these, a carved stone object bearing a marked resemblance to two items from north-west Iberia was found in the cairn material at Newgrange (Shee-Twohig 1981, 126); and a decorated sandstone object, very reminiscent of the stone 'idols' from passage tombs in the Lisbon area, was found just outside the entrance to Knowth site 1 (west) (Eogan 1980). As for other indications of contact with areas outside Ire- land, the passage tombs, henges and Grooved Ware assem- blages of the Orkneys must be mentioned. Not only are there general affinities in tomb design between the areas, but also well-known cases of borrowing motifs from Boyne art to decorate Grooved Ware pottery and associated carved stone balls (and maceheads too, it now appears). The proximity of contemporary henge monuments to Orcadian passage tombs, and the co-occurrence of Grooved Ware in both types of site, raises the possibility that a similar phenomenon may have existed in Ireland. The idea that these large earthen enclosures - which tend to concentrate in areas with passage tombs - were in contemporary use with the tombs is possibly reinforced by the evidence from Monknewtown, in which a 'Carrowkeel' bowl containing a child's cremation was found (Sweetman 1976).5 Finally, the dating of these tombs is as follows. Knowth site 1 has a terminus post quem of 2449 + 67 bc/3330-2790 CAL-BC (BM-1078: Burleigh et al. 1976, 34); and the Newgrange tomb has construction dates of 2475 Â± 45 bc/3320-2910 CAL-BC and 25</page><page sequence="10">construction of Stage I and Stage 2 tombs by small autonomous groups construction of Stage 3 tombs by same groups, investing more effort construction of Stage 4 tombs by fewer, larger groups same few large groups invest more effort, to build Stage 5 tombs OR pooling of effort through involuntary amalgamation of groups OR voluntary pooling of effort by autonomous groups OR pooling of effort through amalgamation into extra- large groups OR pooling of effort through voluntary alliance of autonomous groups OR pooling of effort by some; others continue to build or use smaller tombs OR voluntary pooling of effort OR voluntary or involuntary pooling of effort by some groups; others continue to build or use smaller tombs OR as above, but including smallest tombs OR some large groups building large tombs; smaller groups still building or using smaller tombs [ tomb-building group o tomb Fig. 9.

Stage 6 (estimated dates: ca 2250 bc - ?mid second millen- nium bc/ca 2900-1750 CAL-BC) That passage tombs continued to be built after Stage 5 is suggested by: (i) a radiocarbon date of 2208 Â± 126 bc/3030- 2400 CAL-BC (BM-785) for the construction of Knowth site 2 (Burleigh et al. 1976, 33); and (ii) stratigraphical evidence relating to the erection of Newgrange site Z. (Given the long-standing doubts concerning the validity of Dublin radiocarbon determinations, the dates for Tara and Four- knocks II will not be cited here.) Further evidence, suggesting continuity of the burial rite into the second millennium bc (i.e. post-2450 CAL-BC), has come to light in a non-passage tomb site at Kiltierney, Co. Fermanagh (Daniells and Williams 1977). Here, a cremation accompanied by sherds of probable 'Carrowkeel' pottery and three miniature macehead pendants was stratified above a cremation accompanied by amber beads. The two Boyne Valley tombs - and possibly also that at Knowth site 11 - represent scaled-down, yet only slightly less elaborate versions of Stage 5 tombs. However, evidence from the Beaker occupation horizons at Newgrange and Knowth suggest that, in the Boyne Valley at least, this late episode of passage tomb using was short-lived, ending probably around 2100 bc/2850-2500 CAL-BC. PART 2: INTERPRETATION: THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF PASSAGE TOMB DEVELOPMENT According to the scheme presented in Part 1, the main elements in the process of Irish passage tomb development are as follows: (i) an increase in the size and elaboration of tombs; (ii) the evolution of an elaborate set of rituals (e.g. 'roof box' ceremonies), symbols (e.g. megalithic art) and cult and prestige items (e.g. phallic objects, maceheads); (iii) the establishment (or maintenance) of contacts with the Morbihan area of Brittany, and a broadening of inter- regional contacts to include Britain and Iberia. How, then, can this process be related to the social organi- sation of the passage tomb builders? As is well known by now, the procedure of inferring social organisation from funerary data is not a straightforward mat- ter. Numerous ethnographic studies (e.g. Goody 1962) have demonstrated that, in funerary practices, the temporal social order may be obscured, distorted or even reversed. If - as is the case with neolithic Ireland - alternative sources of infor- mation on social organisation are scarce, it may be impossible for the archaeologist to judge whether or not the observed funerary record represents a direct portrayal of the temporal order. In these circumstances, all that can be achieved is a provisional interpretation, derived from the available evi- dence but open to revision should other sources become available. One way of approaching the problem is to consider the potential of passage tombs as a conveyor of information about intra- and inter-group relationships. More specifically, one could explore the notion that the tombs could be used as a symbol of power, and thus as a medium for inter-group competition. The hypothesis presented here is that the process of passage tomb development ran parallel with, and was an integral part of, a process of increasing social stratification during the first half of the third millennium bc (i.e. ca 3800-3050 CAL-BC). In other words, whilst the early, simple (Stage 1) tombs may well have been constructed by a basically egalitarian society, grad- ually over time the practice of passage tomb building became used as a means for conspicuous consumption, designed to express and enhance the prestige of rival groups. As this happened, so the notion of temporal power became linked increasingly closely with the notion of ancestral/spiritual/ celestial power; so that by the time the Stage 5 tombs were built, their 'sponsors' were believed to possess 'divine' authority. As a way of promoting this idea of a link between temporal and other-worldly power, an elaborate set of rituals, symbols and cultic items was developed; and as an additional way of underlining the power and status of the elite, a network of 'international' contacts with other similarly exalted groups was established. Each of these themes is dealt with in greater detail below. (i) Increasing size and elaboration of tombs. The elements of the process of tomb aggrandisement have already been described, so attention will focus here on its implications. The first concerns the number of tombs built over any one period; the second concerns the exclusivity (or otherwise) of tomb use; and the third concerns the reasons for building ever-grander versions of the same basic monument. As Fig. 8 demonstrates, there is a clear inverse relationship between the size of tombs (measured in terms of kerb diameter) and the number of examples. If we assume that there was some chronological progression from Stage to Stage, this therefore suggests that fewer and fewer new tombs were being erected over any given period. (Obviously, such an assertion should be treated cautiously, since the evidence from Fourknocks I hints that at least one medium-sized tomb may well have been built around the same time as the Stage 5 tombs.) In turn, this suggests that an ever-increasing number of communities were pooling their resources to undertake each new venture, and raises the question of whether this involved a voluntary alliance of equals, or an involuntary secondment of some groups' labour by another, dominant, group. (Fig. 9 attempts to explore the various possible arrangements for Stages 1-5.) As for the exclusivity of tomb use, this is one of the hardest questions to answer. It would be tempting to suggest, but impossible to prove, that as tombs became grander, the num- ber of persons eligible for interment within them decreased. In other words, that whereas the simple tombs were used as the communal burial places of entire communities, tombs such as Newgrange were reserved for exclusive use by the elite dyn- asty. The available evidence is beset by problems of ambiguity and post-depositional disturbance, but one can at least say that: (i) the Carrowmore data suggest that Stage 1 tombs were used for communal interment, and emptied and re-filled several times during their period of use (see especially tomb 4: Burenhult 1984, 64); (ii) conversely, the evidence from Four- knocks I indicates the deliberate sealing of deposits of a few individuals within the chamber recesses, prior to blocking of the passage with further burials (Hartnett 1957). Furthermore, Lynch (1973) and O'Kelly et al. (1978) have argued for an early, permanent sealing of tombs of Stage 3 onwards, which would imply some exclusivity of use. (The issue of whether Newgrange main mound and Knowth site 1 were sealed in this way, or periodically opened for successive cleanings-out and depositions, is yet to be resolved.) A further clue concerns grave goods: if one accepts that maceheads were probably status symbols, then their exclusive association with Stage 5 tombs might be taken to indicate that the occupants had a special status. Finally, as for the motives behind building ever-grander versions of the same thing, one could start by considering why the basic Stage 1 monuments were built at all. Clearly, from the Carrowmore evidence, they served as communal burying places over successive generations. Thus, they would be regarded both as ongoing tombs and as ancestral burial places, and as such a visible reminder of the community's identity and traditions. Furthermore, being grouped into cemeteries, they would provide a focus and rationale for the periodic coming- together of scattered communities; and at other times, the tombs would serve as a constant reminder of the existence of these other communities. Given, then, that the tombs probably played a vital role in maintaining the cohesion and traditions of society, one can appreciate what a powerful tool they could be if used in a 27</page><page sequence="12">deliberate strategy of social change. If a group in a nominally egalitarian society wished to enhance and assert its status, an ideal way to achieve this would be by building a bigger and better passage tomb than its neighbours'. By this act of con- spicuous consumption, the group could gain prestige whilst at the same time legitimating its behaviour by claiming to act within accepted social conventions. Thus, and act of self- interest could be disguised as an act of piety: the group could say it was showing its reverence to the ancestors in a special way. Once this process of competitive 'ancestor worship' had begun, it is easy to see how it might escalate, and what its effects could be. If one group managed to out-do its rivals in the size and splendour of its tomb, it might well try to exploit its dominant position in other ways (e.g. by eroding the political/ economic autonomy of lesser groups). As will be emphasised below, a major advantage in such a strategy would be gained if the concepts of temporal and ancestral/spiritual/celestial power could be fused in people's minds. (ii) Evolution of an elaborate set of rituals, symbols and prestige items. The 'roof-box' ceremony at Newgrange on winter solstice sunrise arguably illustrates this fusion of power well, for on this occasion we see expressed and linked with each other: (i) celestial power (represented by the sun's rays); (ii) ancestral power (represented by the tomb and its contents); and (iii) temporal power (represented by the size and grandeur of the monument). By being able to 'trap' the sun's rays inside the tomb, its builders might claim to have a special relationship with the celestial world - in other words, a 'hot line to the gods' - and furthermore, by using the tomb as a calendrical marker, they could claim an additional element of authority in their control over the knowledge and ordering of time. The role played by megalithic art in the latter is open to debate, and few would concur with all of Brennan's poorly-argued asser- tions (1983). Nevertheless, it is possible that some elements of megalithic art do have calendrical connotations (e.g. the 'sundial' and lunar motifs), which are worth further investi- gation. Others may have been symbols relating to myths about the ancestors and the celestial world, whose meaning can never be retrieved. Whatever the elusive 'correct' interpretation of megalithic art, it is clear that it must have been regarded as an important element in the symbolism and ritual of the time; and moreover, if the understanding and interpretation of the sym- bols was limited at the time to a group of shamans, this could provide yet another tool in the maintenance of temporal power and authority. If this interpretation of the astronomy and art of passage tombs is correct, then other elements can be seen to fit as well. If the aim of the passage tomb builders from Stage 2 (or 3) onwards was to enhance their own power by identifying it with supernatural power, then it is logical that they should try to develop a set of symbols, cult objects and rituals to substan- tiate the process. The Knowth 1 (west) 'idol' is a good example of such a cult object, as are passage tomb balls. Considering the others discussed in Part 1, it is clear that phallic symbolism played an important role in the ideology of the time: examples include the 'fashioned stone' outside Knowth site 12, the sandstone object inside a stone setting at Newgrange, and the primly-named hache a bouton pendant miniatures from several tombs (cf Herity 1974, 129-131). Indeed, the Iberian-type 'idol' may itself be another variant on the phallic theme. As for its significance, it would be easy to suggest that it was a symbol of male power and fertility; it may also have been an element in a complicated ideological scheme in which the tombs played a symbolic female role. (If this were so, then the penetration of the sun's rays into the chamber at winter solstice sunrise would have added symbolic significance, as a token of fertilisation and re-birth.) According to the model proposed here, another element in this process of developing rituals, cults and symbols would have been promotion of the exclusive nature of the operation. This is hinted at by the use of status symbols, such as full-sized and miniature pendant maceheads and exotic items (e.g. pendants made of non-local semi-precious stone, or Iberian- type artifacts). Indeed, if the model is correct, there would not have been a clear-cut difference between status items per se and cult items: perhaps the maceheads were accorded a sym- bolic meaning in the overall ideology of power. (iii) Inter-regional contacts (cf Bradley and Chapman 1984). In Part I it was suggested that in design, if not in art, Irish and Morbihannaise passage tombs developed largely in parallel. If this suggestion is correct, then it matters little whether Irish tomb builders copied from their Breton counterparts, or vice versa; what does matter is that here is a material manifestation of long-distance contact. Other evidence for such contacts, not just with Brittany but elsewhere as well, are summarised in Fig. 10. Much of this evidence comes from small, portable, cultic/status artifacts: the Irish versions of Breton haches a bouton, for example, have already been mentioned7, and it seems that many Irish pendants are miniatures of the various forms of macehead - including the decorated Maesmore ones - which were in widespread use in late neolithic Britain. A preliminary, superficial survey of these items (and of the beads and balls found in Irish passage tombs) suggests that some had been transported considerable distances from their likely area of origin; all represent a considerable investment of effort and skill (Sheridan 1985). The overall impression gained from a study of inter-regional connections is that, by ca 2400 bc/2950 CAL-BC, Irish passage tomb builders had a remarkably broad set of contacts along the Atlantic facade. However, the outcome of these contacts was a uniquely Irish mixture of exotic features, whose significance can be appreciated within a model of indigenous, competing groups. The advantages of having long-distance contacts would have been substantial: not only would they have confer- red prestige, but they could also have provided alliances (both political and matrimonial) and assistance. To summarise, then: if the course of passage tomb devel- opment is regarded as the result of conscious competition between groups to gain and assert authority over each other, then two main strategies seem to have been followed. Both will be familiar to those who have studied an analogous topic, the anthropology of modern-day consumption (cf Douglas and Isherwood 1980). The first strategy consists of playing on existing values: in this case, capitalising on traditional beliefs concerning the sacredness of death and the ancestors, by building bigger and better tombs, and devising ever more elaborate rituals. By this means a group could claim to be paying better homage to its ancestors, whilst in fact underlining its own prosperity and social status through conspicuous consumption. (One might cite the funerary practices of the Victorian British as a parallel phenomenon: cf Parker Pearson 1982.) Such a strategy would have even greater impact if the ancestors had always been regarded as a source of temporal authority, and addressed in issues such as claims to rights over resources, services etc. By merging the concepts of ancestral, celestial and temporal power, a dominant group could legitimate its exploitation of others by claiming a quasi-divine authority. The second strategy consists of attempting to create an exclusive 'culture club', by introducing novel elements into the ceremonial repertoire, and challenging the ability of others to emulate. It may be that long-distance contacts were exploited in this way: by making explicit reference to a foreign cult or fashion (e.g. through adopting maceheads), a group could enhance its prestige. Having succeeded once in employing this tactic, groups might then be encouraged to seek contacts further afield, to obtain even more exotic goods or ideas; hence the extensive network of Stage 5 contacts. Thus far, the model has outlined the characteristics of a process of change. What it has not yet done is suggest reasons for the initiation of the process, or examine developments after Stage 5. These two points will be tackled briefly below. Reasons for inter-group competition The question of what triggered the process of competitive monument construction is at present impossible to answer, 28</page><page sequence="13">given our near-total ignorance of other aspects of the passage tomb builders' lives. However, the ethnographic world offers many examples of the way in which formerly egalitarian societies may become increasingly stratified. Some of these are outlined in Friedman and Rowlands 1977, and an extended discussion of the hierarchisation process is offered in Sheridan 1985. One simple but potent factor is the ambition of an individual or group to enhance its power and status. Given the appropriate conditions, a small group can transform the bal- ance of power through a variety of simple strategies (of which conspicuous consumption is one, and monopoly over the means of production or destruction another). Studies have shown that certain systems of marriage and inheritance (espe- cially those of matriliny and primogeniture) can provide the conditions under which such a shift in power is facilitated (MacCormack 1981). Whether we will ever be able to identify the specific causes for our hypothetical process of social stratification in neolithic Ireland is open to debate; but it would be well to bear these in mind as a desirable goal of future study. Developments after Stage 5 According to the model, only a few, small passage tombs were built after the major Stage 5 erections (in the Boyne Valley, at least). It is tempting to suggest that this sharp decline was due to a collapse in the power system of the passage tomb buiders, which itself may have been related, in part, to the physical collapse of the Newgrange mound. According to O'Kelly (1982), the latter event took place within a century or so of the mound's completion, and may have been due to a slight earth tremor. If, as has been suggested, the main source of temporal control was the belief in divine authority, then such a natural disaster could have been seen as a sign of divine displeasure, thereby shaking people's faith in their leaders. However, other factors may well have been involved in this putative collapse, not least the possibility that the end of the line had been reached in terms of labour investment in monuments. Put simply, it may have been that having con- structed the massive Stage 5 tombs, groups were unable to muster the support to cap these achievements with even greater monuments. As for O'Kelly's suggestion that the land may have been exhausted due to turf stripping, this has been convincingly challenged by Caulfield, and can, I think, be discounted. Nevertheless, the first two factors would have provided a potent combination in the downfall of a theocratic hierarchy. What happened to the resultant Boyne Valley 'power vacuum' is another matter, and another rich source for speculation (see Sheridan 1985). CONCLUSIONS This paper has attempted to present a plausible account of the development of Irish passage tombs, using all the currently-available evidence. The resulting sequence, and the proposed explanation for it, differ considerably from the versions in current use. According to the hypothesis outlined here, the development of Irish passage tombs can best be understood in terms of the attempts of competing groups to outdo each other in the hallowing of the dead. In this particular case, then, the ideology of death appears to have been harnes- sed closely to the power politics of the living, and used as a medium for the assertion of status. Whether this inter- pretation, and the sequence on which it is based, proves to be correct depends largely on the results of future archaeological research. For the present, however, it is proposed as a plaus- ible working hypothesis, and as a challenge to others to devise better ones.

They have been calibrated according to the procedure in Pearson et al. 1983, and are quoted at 95% confidence, with no adjustment for Scott multiplication factor or age lapse. 2) The Knowth sites are numbered according to the new system given in Eogan 1984. 3) This evidence includes the two clay balls, similar to examples from passage tombs, found in Creevykeel court tomb, Co. Sligo. 4) The possibility that the rock represents a glacial erratic cannot, however, be ruled out. Recent work on the petrology of Boyne Valley Beaker pottery (Brindley 1984) has highlighted the fact that several rock types of northern origin occur amongst the drift deposits of the area. 5) However, the stratigraphy at Monknewtown is by no means sufficiently secure to prove that the Carrowkeel bowl cremation does not pre-date the enclosure. 6) For a discussion of maceheads as status symbols, see Sheridan 1985. 7) Similarly shaped, but more obviously phallic objects are known from southern Iberia (Leisner 1943, table 88, Figs. 6-9), but it is unclear whether or not the similarity is fortuitous. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper was developed from a talk given at the 'Megaliths in Context' conference held at Belfast on 15th-18th September 1983. The author wishes to thank Laurence Flanagan and Ian Kinnes for their generous invitation to contribute to the con- ference, Fred Hamond and Stefan Bergh for helpful comments on the draft version of this paper, and Martin Timoney for unpublished information about the Co.
