<plain_text><page sequence="1">SARAH STEBBINS ANTHROPOMORPHISM* (Received 23 July, 1992) INTRODUCTION As children growing up in an age of Freudianism in the popular culture and behaviorism in the laboratory, my contemporaries and I were encouraged to attribute extremely complex unconscious mental states to the human beings we knew, and we were enjoined from attributing any mental states whatsoever to the nonhuman animals of our acquaint- ance. Although we all continued to make attributions of human-like states to animals, these claims were widely regarded as metaphorical. Those "animal lovers" among us who maintained the literal truth of statements about the beliefs, desires, and feelings of animals were regarded as quaintly irrational, like believers in astrology. Such claims, literally understood, were held to exhibit anthropomorphism. Oddly, these attitudes have survived the demise of behaviorism and are quite alive today among philosophers and psychologists holding views with much richer theoretical underpinnings. The debate over whether higher mammals think is no less heated than the debate over whether computers do, and anecdotal testimony from zoo keepers, animal trainers, and pet owners has no place in it. The more intimate the acquaintance between human and animal and the more psycho- logically compelling the attribution of a specific mental state is to the human who makes it, the more suspect the attribution is thought to be. Science requires the dispassionate evidence of controlled experi- mentation. My contention in this paper is that the evidence that nonhuman animals have the mental states we attribute to them comes in very large part precisely from our compulsion to make these attributions in the course of intimate, day-to-day contact with them. The quaint and apparently unscientific beliefs of animal lovers may offer a fairly good Philosophical Studies 69:113-122, 1993. ? 1993 KluwerAcademic Publishers.

ANIMAL MINDS There are a number of arguments in the literature to the effect that nonhuman animals are sentient, that it is appropriate to ascribe mental content to some of their states. In a recent article, Roger Crisp enu- merates four of the most frequently encountered: the argument from behavior, the argument from evolution, the argument from neurology, and the other minds argument (Crisp, 1991). The argument from behavior supports the attribution of mental states to animals by the observation that these attributions play a role in the explanation of their behavior. The success of the argument, of course, depends critically on a more detailed account of what it is for something to play a role in explanation. A very strong interpretation of that is likely to render the argument circular. For example, if we hold that a necessary condition of an attribution's playing a role in the explanation of behavior is that it contribute to a correct account of the behavior, we require that the attribution be true, thus begging the question. A very weak interpretation of what it is for something to play a role in explanation is likely to render the argument implausible. The limited predictive success of a story about the kinds of gasoline my car likes and the kinds it does not like offers little support for the attribu- tion of mental states to the car. Donald Griffin offers a particularly imaginative version of the argument from behavior (Griffin 1976, 1990). In many cases, Griffin argilcs, the attribution of conscious mental states offers the simplest theory of the causal origin of complex nonhuman behavior. Structures which would be required to produce these behaviors without the mediation of consious mental states de- mand more than those required to produce conscious mental states mediating the behaviors. The argument from evolution supports the attribution of mental states on the grounds that they would confer a selective advantage to higher mammals in the process of speciation. Nicholas Humphrey proposes, for example, that introspective consciousness arose in hu- mans and some higher primates to facilitate complex social interactions.</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 115 Humphrey suggests that, reasoning by analogy to their own mental states, human and primate "natural psychologists" are able to under- stand and anticipate the mental states of others, thus more successfully predicting their behavior (Humphrey, 1983). The argument from neurology invokes anatomy to support the attribution of mental states to animals more directly. It observes that some nonhuman animals have the anatomical equipment that we know to produce mental states. In those animals in which the equipment is intact and functioning, we have good reason to expect mental states to occur. The argument from neurology is importantly different from the argument from analogy extended to animal minds. While the argument from analogy relies on introspectively discovered facts about our own states, the argument from neurology invokes scientifically established causal relations between states. Introspection comes in, if at all, only incidentally as it contributes to establishing these causal relations in the laboratory. Crisp's last argument, the other minds argument, turns the traditional philosophical problem of other minds into a reductio ad absurdum of skepticism regarding animal minds. The considerations which give rise to doubts about animal sentience also give rise to the skeptical problem of whether other humans have minds. Since we have no genuine, nonacademic concern about the latter problem, the argument goes, we can have no genuine, nonacademic concern about the former. Unfortunately, its cavalier rejection of skeptical concerns notwith- standing, the argument at best only pushes us to a new skepticism. It supports the existence of mental states in animals without giving us a clue as to what sorts of content such mental states might have. The other arguments, including the argument from analogy, are constructive arguments in the mathematical sense. They support the claim that animals have mental states by pointing to mechanisms we have for detecting the content of these mental states. We arrive at them as hypotheses in successful behavioral explanation, through comparative anatomical studies, or via empathetic processes. Each of these arguments for animal minds makes observations about humans and nonhumans that are critical to a full understanding of the relationship between the mental states of animals and human access to them. For example:</page><page sequence="4">116 SARAH STEBBINS 1) We come to understand mental content in other humans and in nonhumans in large part through inferential processes employed in the explanation of behavior. Empathetic pro- cesses involving introspection are good predictive devices. 2) The complexity of mental content in humans has arisen through evolutionary pressures on mechanisms producing simpler states. 3) Neural structures in humans and nonhumans are central to the production of mental states, and at least to some extent, determine their content. In spite of all that they get right, these arguments fail to answer the most fundamental question about our attributions of mental content to humans and other animals - why some circumstances compel us to make them. Skepticism about other human minds is academic because it is simply impossible for reasonably emotionally healthy humans to regard and treat other human beings as automata. I contend that it is equally impossible to regard and treat birds and higher mammals, as automata, particularly in the typically intimate, day-to-day contact of zookeeper to charge, trainer to student, and pet owner to pet. The explanations of why healthy humans are compelled to make these attributions to other humans and why they are compelled to make them to some nonhumans are closely related. INSTINCTUAL RESPONSES Although inferential, and sometimes explicitly deliberative processes play a large part in the attribution of content to other humans, there is an important class of attributions that is apparently spontaneous and irresistible. We make these attributions in response to the movements, posture, vocalizations, and perhaps most importantly, facial expressions of others. Some examples of mental content attributed in this way are attentiveness, aggressive intention, contact seeking, acute distress, and some basic emotions. There are excellent grounds for thinking that the processes involved in these attributions have a biological foundation (Izard, 1977). In cross cultural studies, Ekman and others have found</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 117 remarkable similarities in the facial expression and recognition of a small number of primary emotions, including anger, disgust, happiness, fear, sadness, and surprise (Ekman, 1973). Newborn babies orient to and study face-like patterns, and from four weeks on prefer them to other visual stimuli (Bowlby, 1969). Easily detectable differences in baby cries provoke predictably different maternal responses. The gradually building cry of hunger provokes a slower, more relaxed response than that of pain, which begins with a sudden loud cry, suggesting that the mother attributes less acute distress in the former case than in the latter (Wolff, 1969). Although these attributions are spontaneous, they need not be un- mediated. Many seem to result from monitoring our own physiological and emotional states as we react to the expressive behavior of others. Empathetic process probably play little part in these very primitive social interactions. It is more likely to be our feeling of fear which leads us to attribute an aggressive intention to another than the observation that we, ourselves, would feel aggressive in that situation or exhibiting that behavior. The familiar, uncomfortable feeling we have that we are being stared at often signals that the attention of another is directed at us. In an acting class exercise, one student whose back is turned is asked to determine which member of the class behind him is staring at him by reflecting on his own experience of discomfort. The discomfort caused by baby cries has straightforward physiological correlates; heightened blood pressure and increased skin conductance were mea- sured in parents of newborns watching a tape of a crying baby (Frodi et al., 1978). In more complex cases, our attributions of mental content to others may arise through lengthy, instinctually mediated behavioral exchanges. The process begins with an orientation toward what we take to be another sentient being. Early failure of coordination automatically interrupts the process of making an attribution, producing momentary disorientation. We are all familiar with the start we experience in realizing that it is a mannequin and not another human being we have passed or bumped. In successful cases, each participant observes changes in the other's behavior, changes in the environment, and his own physiological and emotional reactions, adapting his expectations and behavior to coordinate with the other's.</page><page sequence="6">118 SARAH STEBBINS The control systems model for the description of instinctual behavior proposed by Bowlby in his classic work on attachment behavior gives us a good framework for understanding these processes (Bowlby, 1969). Instinctual behavior is dynamically goal-corrected, Bowlby suggests; the organism continually compares the state of the environ- ment with a goal state and makes frequent adjustments in its own actions to bring the former closer to the latter. The goal state may be entirely pre-set, as it is, for example, in the rooting behavior of new- born puppies, or it may be sensitive to environmental input, as it is, for example, in the imprinting of new-born ducklings. Sometimes the goal of the organism is defined relative to the behavior of another organism, for example, maintaining proximity to a parent or distance from a predator. When two organisms each have a goal state defined in terms of the other, two-way goal correction produces subtle changes in the behavior of each organism, creating and finetuning a pattern of coordi- nated action. The instinctual processes leading to coordinated behavior are pro- ductive of epistemic states, at least in humans, and the propositional content of these states are attributions of mental content to others. For example, mother comes to have beliefs or knowledge of her baby's mental states through the instinctually mediated coordination of her behavior with his. Mother believes the baby is in acute distress, that it is uncomfortable, or that it wants contact with her. We have to regard mother as being in one of these epistemic states because of her disposi- tions to act, including her disposition to assent to certain sentences. More importantly, we have to regard her as being in an epistemic state in order to ground more complex beliefs she acquires through inferen- tial processes. It is because she believes the baby is uncomfortable that her observation that it is dinner time can lead her to the belief that the baby is hungry. Is it possible to reconstruct these instinctual processes as sequences of discrete observations, inferences, perhaps via a folk psychological theory, belief formations, actions, new observations, and change of belief? This sort of model seriously misrepresents the dynamic charac- ter of instinctual interactions, and the relationship between them and the epistemic states they engender. If the pattern of interaction is</page><page sequence="7">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 119 aborted at an early stage, as noted above, disorientation and not false belief is the outcome. RESPONSES ACROSS SPECIES Instinctual mechanisms operate to coordinate behavior with members of our own species, but they also operate to coordinate behavior with members of other species. The reason for our identification with other higher primates is obvious. They are very like us in gross physiology and motor movements. Moreover, facial musculature in human beings is continuous with that in chimpanzees, and facial expressions share profound similarities (Izard, 1977). We find mammals of any species with large rounded heads, large eyes, and small rounded features appealing; these includes babies and Betty Boop, but they also include puppies, kittens, and Mickey Mouse. Consider our relations to puppies. We approach them, smile, reach out our hands and pick them up. They, in turn, approach us with a relaxed open mouth, roll over on their backs, lick us on the face, and follow us as they would their mothers. Like neglected and abused children, neglected and abused puppies are more ardent in their efforts to secure contact with humans, rather than less (Fox, 1971). So, it is unlikely that simple stimulus-response models will explain the puppies' behavior toward human beings. A better explanation is that production of these attachment behaviors, (or the ritualized developments of attachment behaviors into submissive responses), are triggered by a range of noncanine animals with whom the puppies come in contact. The best explanation of our behavior is that instinctual parental impulses in humans show a similar lack of discrimination; they can be triggered by cues exhibited by nonhuman young. There are a number of examples in the literature of the triggering of cooperative instinctual behavior patterns by members of other species. (Examples of noncooperative coordination across species abound in predator-prey relations.) Lorenz's work on imprinting in ducklings is probably the best known of these cases (Lorenz, 1935). My favorite is the discovery at the International Crane Institute that successful artifi- cial insemination in female whooping cranes requires that the insemina-</page><page sequence="8">120 SARAH STEBBINS tion be preceded by a courtship display, but that the semblance of a display performed by a human biologist suffices. It is becoming more and more popular among dog trainers to exploit this crossing of species lines in training techniques that are much more effective than simple stimulus-response procedures. Trainers suggest that competitors and pet owners simulate the behavior of the "alpha", or dominant dog to secure obedience from an older pet and simulate behavior of the dam to secure obedience from a young puppy (Benjamin, 1985). As with human-human interaction, instinctual responses across spe- cies coordinating behavior are productive of epistemic states. The primitive attributions that these processes engender in turn anchor more complex attributions using inferential or empathetic processes. Consider the following real-life and very mundane examples: a) My dog, Amber, is staring at me, ears cocked, loose lipped. When I return her gaze, her lips retract and she begins to pant loudly, while continuing to stare. She wants something, but what? She just ate, and she is standing at the door. She wants to go out. b) Amber is emitting a loud, high-pitched squeal which repeats several times a second. Something is terribly wrong with her, but what? Ouch! Her ear is caught in the clamp of the lead. She is in pain. Each of these examples ground complex, inferential attributions in primitive social reactions, and in so doing illustrate the two ways in which day-to-day contact enhances our ability to attribute inner states to animals. Familiarity with the life patterns of the animal provides a more extensive network of background knowledge on which to draw in arriving at inferences in explanation (compare Hebb, 1946). But in addition, intimate, spontaneous contact between human and animal allows for the free exercise of instinctually mediated responses in forming spontaneous beliefs about the states of the animal. ANTHROPOMORPHISM I have shown that instinctual patterns of behavior in humans give rise to</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 121 beliefs about the content of the mental states of animals with whom they have intimate, day-to-day contact. At the outset, I claimed that these beliefs were pretty well-founded, that they were a fairly good guide to the mental states of animals. Perhaps some of these patterns have evolved to facilitate coordination between humans and non- humans, and we can support a claim that they are epistemically reliable on evolutionary grounds. However, it would be reasonable to object that a more plausible explanation of the evolution of most of these cooperative instinctual patterns of behavior is that they arose in re- sponse to pressures to facilitate smooth social, sexual, and care-taking interactions with members of one's own species. Attributions we make to animals through these instinctual processes are anthropomorphic in this sense: they arise from mechanisms which evolved to process human behavioral inputs. Nature is lazy. Subtle discernment may require complexity of struc- ture beyond what is necessary for successful survival, and so inborn patterns may persist in spite of the fact that they can be regularly triggered by inappropriate stimuli. A baby's sucking response lacks the discernment required to suck only on a breast; from an evolutionary point of view, she makes a mistake when she sucks on a finger. How- ever, in many of the cases of human instinctually mediated responses to members of other species, it is much less plausible that there has been a mistake. There is evolutionary continuity between features and behav- iors in us and those features and behaviors in other species which trigger our responses, so it is reasonable to predict a continuity of mentality, as well. Similarities in neurological structures and processes support the attributions of similar mental states, arising through the action of these processes. And finally, these attributions successfully anchor explanations of more complex behavior in animals. Humans and other species have evolved in tandem from the same primitive creatures in response to the same environmental pressures. Their behavioral patterns have evolved in tandem, as well. One would expect that the instinctual responses of one species would be largely appropriately signalled by the behavior of other, fairly closely related species. Those species more distant from us are less likely to exhibit the structures and behavior which provoke us spontaneously to attribute content to their states.</page><page sequence="10">122 SARAH STEBBINS NOTE * I am grateful to Shaughan Lavine and Sheldon Solomon for helpful suggestions.
