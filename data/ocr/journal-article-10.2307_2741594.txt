<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Interpretation of Some "Anthropomorphic" Representations From the Upper Palaeolithic by ROBERT C. REED Department of Anthropology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, N.Y. 13210, U.S.A. 10 VII 75 A number of depictions attributable to Upper Palaeolithic cave and mobiliary art in Western Europe (figs. 1 and 2) are con- ventionally considered to be "anthropomorphic" in nature. (By focusing on the "anthropomorphic," one eliminates from consideration those which are unquestionably human.) Many of the depictions in question are (in fact by definition) am- biguous, and to accept that they are essentially of human aspect would seem to depend upon assumptions that they may involve disguise, "ghosts," the portrayal of humans in a shaman- type role, or even cartoonery, caricature, or representational laxity. One must grant that a few well-known depictions could be explicable in terms of shamanistic or ceremonial representa- tion, but a similar interpretation of others might as likely be- tray an anthropomorphizing tendency on the part of inter- preters as the actual intent of the original artists (which is not to dismiss the latter possibility). I feel that reevaluation of some of these depictions may be worthwhile, on the trial assumption that they might essentially have been renderings of particular animals, albeit rather sketchy and subjective endeavors. If this were the case, the significance of the somewhat human-like features selected by the artists becomes problematical. That the movements, pos- tures, and "facial expressions" of certain other species bear an occasional resemblance to those of humans is fully acceptable to us, and the same perception may have exercised magical or merely whimsical appeal to Upper Palaeolithic peoples as well. It may be that certain "anthropomorphic" representational devices were sufficient to embody the essences of particular animals which existed quite outside of the much more familiar and commonly depicted herbivore class.

While the depictions considered here are hardly uniform, there are certain recurring features. Thus, a muzzle with or without up-tilted snout is characteristic of those which retain facial features. In three or four cases this is associated with a laterally extended line of the mouth, suggestive of certain ani- mals. At least four of the creatures depicted are ithyphallic. Furthermore, several (and this may include the famous "sorcerer") at Les Trois Freres) are shown in a peculiar, slightly flexed position which might suggest falling, climbing, or even swimming (figs. 1d-i, 2a-h), but in any case is normally a momentary rather than a sustained human posture (at least among the living) and is not particularly convincing in the context of human dance. A few of the depictions are "pierced" by lines which are logically, if not necessarily correctly, con- sidered to be projectiles of some sort. (This would not, inci- dentally, exclude their representing porcupine quills.) Ears are generally absent, and there are only three or four instances of tails. The extremities are poorly articulated or absent, but in the former case could as easily be considered paws as hands.' I Ucko and Rosenfeld (1967:204 and fig. 89) are politely skeptical concerning the accuracy of Breuil's famous reproduction of the "sorcerer") at Les Trois Freres and offer a recent photograph and a new sketch of the figure, neither of which is nearly so explicit as Breuil's version nor as supportive of its status as a unitary com- position. I was nevertheless somewhat astonished to see a black- Altogether, these depictions seem an unimpressive lot from the point of view of artistic virtuosity, and on this basis their significance might be considered to differ from that of the easily identifiable depictions of the herbivores which dominate Upper Palaeolithic art as a whole. But here caution may be in order. We perhaps tend to overemphasize the representational thor- oughness of much of Upper Palaeolithic art, both because a relatively few famous and expert depictions are so often re- produced and because the denotative characteristics of deer, bison, horse, etc., are so obvious and familiar to us. A perusal of the corpus of Upper Palaeolithic depictions reveals that, even allowing for fading and destruction, many of these familiar animals are indeed sketchily, exaggeratedly, or incompletely rendered. Rationally observed, a fair number can be con- sidered somewhat inaccurate in details, despite their easy recog- nition. In other words, the "anthropomorphic" depictions con- sidered here need not have been much inferior in quality in the eyes of the Upper Palaeolithic beholder. A few conven- tions may have been sufficient to denote species which we are not primed to recognize. Accordingly, I would suggest that some of the "anthro- pomorphs" were depictions of members of the Mustelidae family, which includes such animals as otters, martens, fishers, polecats, minks, and weasels, most or all of which would have inhabited Western Europe during the late Pleistocene (Kurten 1968:90-107). The Commarque depiction (fig. la) is plausibly within the range of the conformation of an otter's head, and at any rate is far better considered that of a mustelid than that of a human. The judgment may be enhanced by the realisti- cally extended line of the mouth. A number of other depictions illustrated here possess a similarly animalistic quality of head or face, nothing explicitly suggesting that a mask is involved. The up-turned snouts of figures 1 c-e and 2f could suggest the conformation of the fisher's or marten's muzzle, this charac- teristic being a prominent distinction between otter and marten/ fisher. The strange face engraved at Marsoulas (fig. 2i) approxi- mates that of several species, including man, but the shape of the ears (if such they are), the cleft between nose and mouth, and the dip at the crown of the head (coloration mark?) could suggest glutton (wolverine) or polecat, though not with pre- cision. The engraved "anthropomorphs" at Los Casares (fig. 2j) suggest to me the position of minks or weasels poised on hind legs. Concerning the falling/climbing/swimming posture of sev- eral of the depictions, such would not be inappropriate to the Mustelidae, collectively considered. Fisher and marten are adapted to tree life (where they make their cavelike dens) and otter to streams (fig. Ii, left [?]), the latter also displaying sliding antics in the snow and mud. Furthermore, otters use their front paws in ways which are somewhat comparable to those and-white photograph of the "sorcerer," the immediate impression (and angle of view) of which is quite different from all those cited above. (Maringer 1960:pl. 9): that which constitutes the shoulder area and proximal forelimbs of the Breuil version in fact looks very much like a mammalian head-mouth, nose, and (elongated) eye reasonably positioned (fig. 2c)-and could be loosely interpreted as the head of a fisher or marten. The "Breuil" tail-cum-genital arrangement is ambiguous and could be seen as simply a bushy tail, although ill-positioned. The antlered "Breuil" head appears all the more extraneous in terms of this interpretation, as do the forepaws, sufficient to suggest that they belonged to an earlier depiction or were added as a conversion of a "bushy-tailed animal." What may have been the original forelimbs of the latter can be seen in the elongated black smear of some photographs (e.g., Leroi-Gourhan 1967 :fig. 57). Of course, some features weigh against an altered interpretation-human-like hind limbs, little or no neck-yet each of these deficiencies can be matched among other depictions reproduced here, and the posture becomes all the more typical of the falling/climbing/swimming group. One would like to propose that renewed study of the actual "sorcerer" depiction might yield a solution, but judging by versions in the Ucko and Rosenfeld book it may be too late for that (save, per- haps, through destructive technical analysis of pigments). Vol. 17 N No. 1 * March 1976 137</page><page sequence="3">in which humans use their hands-e.g., grabbing (sometimes with palm upward), feeding, tossing objects, utilizing webbed digits as "fingers," and even, apparently, tending toward right- handedness (Ewer 1973:183, 187; also various accounts in Maxwell 1960, 1963). Otters, furthermore, maintain regular trails in the winter snow, store food, and display a penchant for sleeping on their backs. Coupled with predatory habits (including cooperative fish drives on the part of the otter),2 these versatile activities of the Mustelidae might have appealed to anthropomorphizing sensibilities of Upper Palaeolithic peoples, thus inspiring just that dimension which we perceive in the depictions without, however, certifying a truly totemistic sense of identification between artist and subject. If one must insist on there having been a deliberate human dimension to these depictions, then the idea that they show animals in vaguely human guise may be as likely as or more plausible than the converse. The con- ception of man as quasi-otter, for instance, may have had less appeal than that of otter as quasi-man (i.e., partaking of human behavior). Worth noting is the clear possibility that pelts of various Mustelidae would have served as protective garments for Upper Palaeolithic peoples in a cold environment, given both their warmth and their inherent attractiveness (cf. mink coats and ermine collars in our own era). This circumstance, in its way, could have stimulated observation of the habits of these ani- mals, insofar as possible, as well as creating a certain sense of indebtedness toward them. (Although a decidedly remote sug- gestion, and somewhat oblique to present purposes, some of the depictions considered here do have the look of flayed animals, pelts, paws, ears, and bushy tails removed!) The erections displayed in a few of the depictions would not be inappropriate, given the prolonged and rambunctious mating habits of Mustelidae (Ewer 1973:318), although obser- vation of this could hardly have been commonplace (excepting the hypothetical case of tame animals). Evidently, otters have been observed to mate in "face-to-face" manner, or to appear to do so (Ewer 1973:321). Here again, a somewhat comical human dimension to the habits of these animals might have reinforced their appeal, especially in combination with other instinctive habits which man might have interpreted in his own image. Among potential objections to the present hypothesis might be the fact that one or two conventional depictions of Musteli- dae are known from Upper Palaeolithic art: an engraving from Los Casares and another from Les Trois Freres (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967:fig. 77; Kurten 1968:fig. 37). Both of these, however, involve the glutton (wolverine), the threatening size and somewhat bearlike appearance of which perhaps placed it in quite a different category from the smaller animals con- sidered here. In fact, given the range of animals depicted in Upper Palaeolithic art (however infrequently for some), there might be grounds for surprise were otters and other mustelids entirely absent. I propose, then, that the depictions in question were not conceived as fundamentally human, if human at all-a point emphasized by the fact that clearly human depictions (includ- ing figurines) do exist otherwise. If a perceived bridge between human and animal behavior is betrayed here, then the poten- tiality for psychological identification with certain animals must surely have existed, but to what depth we can hardly say. Whether we should go so far as to postulate a truly totemistic orientation on the part of Upper Palaeolithic peoples, or a sense of the reincarnation of the dead in mammalian form,3 is anyone's guess. The distribution of the depictions considered here is of some interest. While the selection is presumably not comprehensive, examples occur in a rather representational manner in that among the major clusters of Western European sites yielding Upper Palaeolithic art only the Rh8ne and southern Spain are unrepresented; central Spain, Asturias, the Santander region, the western and eastern Pyrenees, and the Dordogne region figure in more or less proportional degree. This may give rise to a pair of interesting options: 1. If all or most of the depictions are truly human, then we might imagine that the general representational formulae were diffused across much of the later Upper Palaeolithic zone of concentration in Western Europe. 2. If, as I contend, the depictions are essentially animal, then similarity through convergence may be plausible-on the grounds that human disguise, magic, etc., may have been sub- ject to a great deal of idiosyncrasy, whereas particular animal species behave and can be perceived in essentially the same ways wherever they exist. 2 Here one might wonder (but to no present satisfaction) whether such an animal might ever have been tamed and utilized by Upper Palaeolithic peoples for just this purpose. The very enig- matic engraving from Isturitz (fig. 2h) might remotely be construed as a depiction of two animals wearing collars (each, incidentally, now recognized as having a pendulous anthropomorphic breast, which rather eliminates the traditional "amorous scene" interpre- tation). Otter cubs are unusually domesticable, and the ferret was domesticated from the polecat in historic times. 3 Mention ought to be made of certain Upper Palaeolithic de- pictions which are conveniently described as "ghosts" (cf. Leroi- Gourhan 1967 :Chart 30). I would suggest that some of these, even including the "owls" at Les Trois Freres, were intended to depict seals. Those which show simple round heads and sloping shoulders truly suggest, to anyone who has seen them, seals bob- bing in open water. This need not be incompatible with the fact that complete and realistic seal representations do exist, for proxim- ity to and experience of seals must have varied among the peoples involved. Nor would this suggestion exclude an anthropomorphic dimension in regard to their original inspiration. We might, nevertheless, examine what sort of images we regard as "ghostly" and why they have come to exercise such an appeal. References Cited BERENGUER, M. 1975. Prehistoric man and his art.
