<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Material of Form:  Vernon Lee at the Vatican and Out of It Jonah Siegel it nearly goes without saying that the material has conventionally been identified in contradistinction to the ideal, and, more neutrally, that it describes the thing on which form works, that  which is acted on in the process of formation (as in raw material). in  spite of this intimate relation, however, matter has regularly been  presented as the necessary antithesis of form itself. But what happens when the material is itself understood to be  doing formal work? in literary studies, especially of the realism-dominated nine- teenth century, the place of the material is vital but vexed—both as a  problem of representation and as it comes to involve a number of  ethical concerns. On the one hand we have a basic issue that has seen  renewed interest of late: how does a pattern of words manage to  capture and relay the experienced object world? On the other we have  an old but recently re-energized set of questions that are more social:  what do particular objects mean in a text; what does it mean to own, to  acquire, to see, or to be associated with specific things; what is the  significance of having or not having wealth?1 in the fine arts, the tendency has been for the value ascribed  to aesthetic objects to derive more and more from the ideas they are  thought to convey, to the point that over the last thirty years or more  conceptual art may be said to have become the defining mode of  AbstrAct: the conceit of a child’s unmediated encounter with galleries of antique art  that opens Vernon Lee’s “the Child in the Vatican” (1881) seems designed to evoke  that well-worn contrast between an idealized vision of antiquity based on sparse knowl- edge and conjecture characteristic of earlier eras and a more informed—because more  material—encounter with particular objects typical of later periods. And yet, the scan- dalously formalist account of the niobe group at the center of the essay moves the argu- ment beyond the emphasis on material experience that it initially appears to valorize,  and toward a formal account of aesthetic value that places an emphasis on abstraction  that surpasses even the most idealizing art-historical models.   winter 2013 </page> <page sequence="2"> 190 JOnAh SiegeL art-making. even painters and sculptors tend to see themselves as  working out an idea as much as a formal question, and far more than a  material one. And so, if someone were to say, “that is a great work of art  because it is beautiful,” the modern connoisseur might well hesitate to  assent. Something more than beauty is necessary, we think. All the  more problematic would be the claim that a work of art is successful  because of the fine workmanship entailed in its production; possibly  strangest of all would be the idea that something is admirable because  of the material out of which it is made. when damien hirst covers a  platinum cast of a skull in more than eight thousand diamonds and  inserts the teeth of the original in the mouth of the simulacrum, he  short-circuits this question, making idea, form, and material value  match up, or at least oscillate together, in a network of unresolved  mutual interference.2 the nineteenth century was at once more material and far more  ideal than later centuries have been able to appreciate. From neoclas- sical concepts and institutions the Victorian period inherited a remark- ably concrete set of ideal values that were embedded in an improbably  concrete matrix. neoclassical theorists from Johann Joachim winckel- mann to Joshua reynolds repeatedly insist on the need for art to repre- sent something that is beyond the fallible, experiential beauty of the  world. nevertheless, the beauty they celebrate was by our standards  strangely locatable: it was to be found in the canonical masterpieces of  classical antiquity held in a few collections in italy, and it could be  approached anew (though never equaled) by copying those objects.3 Still, the neoclassical canon was buffeted by change even  before it had reached its fullest point of consolidation. elgin marble  fragments challenged objects in the British museum and even prized  pieces held at the Vatican since the sixteenth century. the power and  presence of the Venus de Milo (discovered in 1820) or the Winged Victory  of Samothrace (discovered in 1863), along with new discoveries in archae- ology (from the polychromy of classical work to the power of archaic  statues), were among those developments roiling the field, even as a  general sense still prevailed that the masterpieces of fifth-century  Athens, and specifically the actual objects held in modern rome  (which were thought to be from that time and place), were somehow  the ideal formal manifestations of artistic achievement.4 new discoveries aside, the increasing ease of travel to the Conti- nent meant that the nineteenth century increasingly gained direct   ViCtOriAn StudieS / VOLume 55, nO. 2 </page> <page sequence="3"> the mAteriAL OF FOrm 191 Fig. 1.

(2: 312–14) describing a sense of presence that is emphatically not divine, Vernon  Lee refuses such transports. here she is in 1881 at the same place and  refusing to leave it, or even to look at the Apollo:  ViCtOriAn StudieS / VOLume 55, nO. 2 </page> <page sequence="5"> the mAteriAL OF FOrm 193 And, indeed, it is a desolate place, this Vatican, with its long, bleak, glaring corri- dors; its half-lit, chill, resounding halls; its damp little Belvedere Court, where  green lichen fills up the fissured pavement; a dreary labyrinth of brick and mortar,  a sort of over-ground catacomb of stones, constructed in our art-studying, rather  than art-loving times. (18) the autobiographical quality of Lee’s text is part of its argument, a way  of insisting that she is not writing with secondhand knowledge but  responding to the thing itself. Lee carefully evokes an actual experi- ence of place, even as she turns that ambivalence toward sites of display  into a characteristically modernist romance of lost authenticity and  deracination at institutions built for “art-studying” rather than “art- loving times.” Born of British parents but raised on the Continent, Lee  provides one telling instance of the social changes underlying cultural  developments, of the new possibility for intimacy with the art of  southern europe for northern travelers or expatriates. And yet, she  offers one of the most uncompromising turns to formalism of her day,  albeit one still needing to express its emancipation from the critical  tradition that had shaped earlier responses to classical objects. Lee  puts into play a double realism, combining an experience of the art  objects where they are currently housed with a dry-eyed clarity about  the lost original location of works that once existed “each in happy  independence, against a screen of laurel or ilex branches, or on the  sun-heated gable of a temple, where the grass waved in the fissures and  the swallows nested, or in a cresset-lit, incense-dim chapel, or high  against the blue sky above the bustle of the market place” (Lee 18).  So far so good, if we wanted to tell yet again that story about  the alienating nature of the museum that has been told so often for  the last hundred years or so. it can seem that for Lee, the experience of  a museum involves re-isolating the work of art and then imaginatively  placing it in its original location—not winckelmann’s ethereal fantasy  of greece, but a material, sensual, specific, and concrete original  context. But Lee is not attempting to rescue the statues or to replace  them in the originary locus from which they have been torn. She is too  sensitive to the complex relationship between knowledge and art  appreciation. the canon of statues is inadequate given contemporary  historical concepts of value, which Lee ironizes by referencing the  unstable history of admiration and the snobbery that drives it: winter 2013 </page> <page sequence="6"> 194 JOnAh SiegeL Oh, yes, the statues which taught the child were a very mixed company, such as the  carefully-trained of our day, who can endure only Phidias, and next to Phidias,  only Clodion or Carpeaux, would scarcely like to know at all. not Phidian, all of  them, nor even, alas, Praxitelian; they were not the elgin marbles nor the Venus of  milo, sole objects of the feeble love of us good, learned folk; they were those  extremely harum-scarum statues of the Vatican: a few of them copies of lost, irre- proachable originals . . . a certain number of impostors of now exploded reputa- tion, the Apollo, the Laocoön, the Antinous, and a whole host of quite despicable  others, of every degree of lateness of epoch and baseness of work. (29–30) Lee’s use of the conceit of the child raised with an inexplicable love of  the Vatican statues allows her to historicize the form of sculpture in a  way that follows from Pater (and ultimately hegel) but more vividly  personalizes an experience of alienation, which is not really attribut- able to specific curatorial practices or the fact of exhibition, but to the  failure of the medium itself to mean in modernity: “the fancy  language of our modern child is the language of colour, of movement,  of sound, of suggestion, of all the broken words of modern thought  and feeling: and the statue has none of these” (20, my emphasis). the  statues speak to the child but their language will be purely formal: “we  have been talking,” she writes,  Fig. 3. galleria delle Statue. the Vatican.

(29) Lee’s essay is at once bold and subtle. not only are the Vatican  statues loved in spite of their failings, but contempt for earlier aesthetic  dispensations is traced to unstable intellectual fashion. even the actual  experience of the material realm, ostensibly valorized at the outset, is  called into question.  the most striking illustration of the failure and recuperation of  sculpture in the essay is the astonishing set piece on the niobe group in  which the critic painstakingly makes a tragic vision of a family destroyed  by the cruel jealousy of divinity into a formal, not a representational,  object of perception. Lee’s argument is driven from the outset by material  as well as thematic concerns. After all, as is immediately apparent from  any photograph of the group, the niobe statues make for an excellent  object lesson in the unsatisfactory options for display of works of art  outside of their original context; it is as impossible for the eye to see them  winter 2013 </page> <page sequence="8"> 196 JOnAh SiegeL Fig. 5. niobe and daughter. marble. the uffizi, Florence.

Lee knows that she is choosing a scandalous instance for  this exercise: “what is the idea, the abstract intellectual conception of  the niobe group?” she asks. “merely the fact of the slaughtering of the  niobides by Apollo and Artemis in the presence of their mother”  (37–38). it is evidently the contrast between poignant theme and  formal experience that interests her as she makes the case that  the only intrinsic perfection of art is the perfection of form, and that such perfec- tion is obtainable only by boldly altering, or even casting aside, the subject with  which this form is only imaginatively, most often arbitrarily, connected; and by  humbly considering and obeying the inherent necessities of the material in which this  form is made visible or audible. (48, my emphasis) with her bold and unsentimental insistence on the force of the actual  experience of the art object, Lee enables the formal qualities of  artworks to be the measure of their achievement—formal qualities  fully manifested only through engagement with “the inherent necessi- ties of the material.” while less familiar to modern readers than some parts of  Ovid, the story of niobe’s sad fate at the hands of Apollo and diana  after offending Leto, their mother, was widely current in nineteenth- century literary culture. in retaliation for niobe’s vaunting of her  many children the two gods destroy her entire family, leaving niobe  inconsolable. here is a fragment from thomas Bulfinch’s 1855 Age of  Fable, which comes pretty directly from Ovid. it picks up the story after  the gods have finished off the boys. niobe’s husband kills himself out  of grief, and the girls are struck down as they mourn. At the conclusion  of the bloodbath, only one remained, whom the mother held clasped in her arms, and covered as it  were with her whole body. “Spare me one, and that the youngest! O spare me one  of so many!” she cried; and while she spoke, that one fell dead. desolate she sat,  among sons, daughters, husband, all dead, and seemed torpid with grief. the  breeze moved not her hair, no color was on her cheek, her eyes glared fixed and  immovable, there was no sign of life about her. her very tongue cleaved to the roof  of her mouth, and her veins ceased to convey the tide of life. her neck bent not,  her arms made no gesture, her foot no step. She was changed to stone, within and  without. Yet tears continued to flow; and borne on a whirlwind to her native moun- tain, she still remains, a mass of rock, from which a trickling stream flows, the  tribute of her never-ending grief. (158–59) winter 2013 </page> <page sequence="10"> 198 JOnAh SiegeL never-ending grief: niobe became a byword for it, as in hamlet’s  simile, “like niobe, all tears” (1.2.149). Lee goes to great lengths to make this melancholy set of statues  representing the death of a family and a mother’s woe into a kind of  fugue, thereby moving it closer to the condition of music that Pater  had identified four years before, in the “School of giorgione” (1877),  as the aspiration of all art.  if Lee’s indifference to the emotional content of this represen- tation of massacre is striking, no less so is the fact that the group does  not in fact reside at the Vatican. it is on display at the uffizi in Flor- ence, where it has been since the late eighteenth century. Stranger still,  Lee doesn’t even discuss the objects in Florence, but encourages the  reader to visualize far smaller terra-cotta reproductions of the sort  produced in Britain around the middle of the century. the untrou- bled shift from one concrete particular to another serves to instantiate  the fundamental deracination inherent in institutions built for “art- studying rather than art-loving.” the objects in the museum are  already in a company that falsifies their intended effect, but there may  be a virtue in the conceptual play allowed by that condition. imagining  them at a reduced size allows Lee to reproduce in the imagination the  pedimental display of the group that the architect C. r. Cockerell had  proposed in 1836 as an alternative to the widely despised arrangement  at the uffizi.6 under Lee’s careful guidance the viewer is taken not to  greece but to an entirely conceptual space whose minimal materiality  (little statues, a table) helps one to imagine the original arrangement  of the elements in the group in order to recognize a formal harmony: Come and stand at a little distance from the table on which the wooden gable and  statues are set. So, now we can get an idea (which in the gallery we cannot) of the  general effect of the group. it seems so simple, but it is not: it is in sculpture some- thing like what a fugue is in music: it is a homogeneous form due to the extremely  skilful co-ordination of various forms; it is a harmonious whole, because the parts  are combined just at the point where their diversities coalesce. For, as the various  voices of the fugue, some subtly insinuating themselves half whispered, while the  others are thundering their loudest or already dying away into silence, meet and  weave together various fragments of the same melody, so also do the figures of the  group, some standing, some reclining, some kneeling, some rising, some draped,  some nude, meet our sight in various ways so as to constitute in their variety, one  great pattern. (32)  ViCtOriAn StudieS / VOLume 55, nO. 2 </page> <page sequence="11"> the mAteriAL OF FOrm 199 Lee insists on the necessary limitations of particular media; in the  process, she denies the entire tradition of using literature to illumi- nate the fine arts. indeed, the tendency provokes an irritation that  needs to be suppressed:  But by the side of this overwhelming positive sense of beauty there creeps into our  consciousness an irritating little sense of negation. For the more intense becomes  our perception of the form, the vaguer becomes our recollection of the subject;  the strong imaginative realization of the story of niobe, conjured up by the mere  mention of her name, dwindles to nothing in the presence of the group repre- senting the chief incident of history; the shrieks and desperate scuffling of feet,  which we had heard in our fancy, gradually die into silence; our senses cease to  shrink with horror, our sympathies cease to vibrate with pity, as we look upon this  visible embodiment of the terrible tragedy. we are no longer feeling emotion; we  are merely perceiving beauty. how has this come to pass? Shall we look into  ourselves and analyze in the darkness of our consciousness? nay, rather first look  for an explanation in the materially visible, the clear, easily examined work of art.  Come and look at the group once more: this time not to understand its beauty, but  to understand why there is in it nothing beyond this beauty. (34) there is room to wonder whether denying the force of emotion, as Lee  does here by evoking such a vivid memory of its experience, can really do  the work of removing affect from the equation. in any case, as culture  aspired for an ever-closer engagement with experienced reality  throughout the nineteenth century, it seemed destined to respond with  increasing force to the material experience of art, often leaving the door  partly open to feelings that one might expect to have been excluded by  the denial of mere anecdotal interest. earlier, i cited damien hirst’s  gorgeous and appalling skull because of its mobilization of a number of  openly contradictory elements: idea, matter, and, of course, mortality.  Like hirst, Lee knows that she is choosing a scandalous instance; it is  evidently the gap between poignant theme and material experience that  interests both of them. unsentimentally insisting on the force of the  encounter with the art object, Lee, the future author of Anthropomorphic  Aesthetics (1912), anticipates a modern aesthetic regime in which the  formal qualities of artworks will be the measure of their achievement.  Still, for Lee, the sense of what it might mean to approach the material is  consistently inflected by earlier forms of mediation of the object, and by  the kinds of hopes and fantasies—not to say irritations—likely to be set in  motion when the memory of an inherited desire confronts the fact of  something that cannot manage to feel like satisfaction.  winter 2013 </page> <page sequence="12"> 200 JOnAh SiegeL As Bulfinch points out, the story of niobe “furnished Byron  with a fine illustration of the fallen condition of modern rome.” he  cites lines from canto 4 of Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage (1812–18) that  would have been familiar to any educated reader of english literature  in the period:  the niobe of nations! there she stands, Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe; An empty urn within her withered hands, whose holy dust was scattered long ago. (qtd. in Bulfinch 159) Perhaps this reference can explain why Lee leaves the Vatican to find  her example of a significant statue; we may use the passage as a  reminder that the formal argument evidently does not escape a fasci- nation with niobe’s tragedy just because Lee attempts to translate it  into music. the essay, we might say, provides the child whose loss niobe  was forever mourning, giving new life (even “voice”) to works of art  even as they were in the process of being lost to modern admiration.
