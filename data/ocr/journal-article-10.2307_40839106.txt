<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes on Oceanic Objects in the 'Treasures of the Ethnographic Collec- tion1 exhibition at the Ulster Museum by Jill Hassell. A rare barkcloth covered figure from Easter Island ( 1 of 3 extant). The black and orange body decorations are thought to represent tattoo patterns, and if this is so it provides important evidence. Collected by Thomson. Hawaiian feather cloak - predominantly red with yellow and black feathers. This has kept its colour very well, and is one of the most eye- catching objects in the exhibition. It was collected by Thomson, and is said to have been the property of King Kamehameha III. Hawaiian barkcloth cloak, reproducing a European design - very full and with a high collar. Brown barkcloth with lighter brown checked pattern. Hawaiian fishing basket - lidded gourd covered with basketry of split roots. Hawaiian fan of plaited leaf, incorporating human hair and wool in the handle area. Society Islands barkcloth decorated with leaf designs produced by pressing on real leaves soaked in dye. Collected by Thomson. New Zealand tiki or neck ornament of nephrite, of larger than average size. Donated by Mrs F. Sykes.
