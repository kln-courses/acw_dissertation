<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTARIES Reply to Shweder's "On Savages and Other Children" C. R. HALLPIKE McMaster University In his review article on my Foundations of Primitive Thought (Hallpike 1979) Shweder (AA 84:354-366, 1982) describes me as "rushing in" and "collapsing" the revered distinction "be- tween collective representations and individual thought processes." While this conveys an agreeably dynamic image of my work, it also suggests that I have overlooked the obvious. The belief that collective representations must not be explained by reference to the thought pro- cesses of individuals has long been a dogmatic conviction among social anthropologists, and a basic item in the instruction of students. So someone who learned his anthropology from Evans-Pritchard and Needham, and who subse- quently published two ethnographic mono- graphs, is unlikely to have been oblivious to the problem, and if my arguments against this dogma had been unsatisfactory it would not have required child psychologist Shweder to have discovered this. The social anthropologists who reviewed the book (Beidelman 1981; Gellner 1980; Hicks 1981; Howes 1981; de Ruij- ter 1981; Southwold 1981; Willis 1981) would obviously have fastened on a fundamental defect which must have invalidated my whole argu- ment, but none has done so, and indeed, some have praised this section of the book as par- ticularly convincing. The discussion of the relation between collec- tive representations and individual thought pro- cesses occupies about 60 pages in the first two chapters alone, and some idea of the scope of my theory can be gauged from the following passage (which is only a part of a considerably wider argument): I shall show that the Durkheimian model is based on at least five major fallacies or con- fusions. The first . . . is the assumption that learning is passive and that the categories and ideas of a culture can be absorbed ready- made by the individual by a simple process of imitation without assimilation. The second is that because no single individual's thinking can affect the collective representations of his culture, therefore the thinking of individuals in general has no effect on collective repre- sentations. The third fallacy . . . is the failure to distinguish between short- and long-term ef- fects. Within a single generation the possibil- ity of cognitive changes in the population af- fecting collective representations is obviously fairly restricted, but this limitation will decrease in significance as the number of generations increases over time. The fourth is the confusion between the mind considered in terms of its content of a certain set of beliefs and ideas, and the mind considered as a system of cognitive processes. The fifth is the failure to distinguish between the particular and distinctive forms of collec- tive representations in different societies, such as the various types of divination, and the underlying similarities and basic assump- tions common to them all, such as notions of fate or luck. [Hallpike 1979:44-45] Shweder, unfortunately, does not seem to have taken any of this in, since the best he can do by way of presenting my theory is to refer, repeatedly, to an alleged "50% Rule": "the mastery of a conceptual problem must be far above the 50 per cent level in adults if a notion is to be incorporated into the collective repre- sentations of a society" (Shweder, p. 355). This is probably true, but it is a very minor point in the context of the total argument. That Shweder is obviously convinced that it crystal- lizes the essential features of my theory is therefore disconcerting, to say the least, since if he finds it so hard to understand my book, which has been generally praised for its lucidity, what can he be expected to make of the labyrinths of Piaget? Certainly, his description of Piaget as claiming that the mind of the child is "in- tendedly scientific," and that every individual in each generation has to invent "the proposi- 656</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTARIES 657 tional calculus, the principles of experimental reasoning, and the rules of statistical inference" for him or herself does not suggest that he has made any profound study of Piaget's work. (Rather inconsistently, despite his evidently low opinion of Piaget on those matters psychological which were Piaget's life's work, Shweder quotes him at length on the status of collective repre- sentations, as though in matters sociological Piaget were of unimpeachable authority.) In this pensive mood let us therefore investi- gate a sample of Shweder's references to developmental psychology and ethnography. 1. "... as Goldberg et al. (1974) note, children can cluster things categorically as soon as they can talk" (Shweder, p. 358), which ap- pears to suggest the emergence of a spontaneous ability in infants to sort objects into taxonomic categories. In the experiment conducted by Goldberg et al. the children were actually in the age range 29-35 months (hardly "as soon as they can talk"), and the purpose of the experiment was primarily to investigate memory rather than the classificatory ability of young children. So, the subjects were shown pairs of related objects (e.g., "fork-spoon," "cookie-lollipop") and unrelated objects (e.g., "candy-lion," "apple- cup") which had been presorted by the experi- menters. The results showed that the subjects found it easier to recall related pairs than unrelated pairs. I do not question these find- ings, but how do they refute Piaget, or me? In the first place, this experiment did not replicate those of Piaget and others where the child is asked to sort objects into groups of things "that belong together." Second, the design of the ex- periment does not give any grounds for con- cluding that the children were using the experi- menters' taxonomic categories of "utensil," "food," and "animal," rather than some more elementary, complexive mode of association. These are not criticisms of Goldberg et al. (who do not claim that their results refute Piaget, and do not even refer to him), but of Shweder's in- terpretation of the experiment. 2. "Three year olds understand many aspects of the concept of causation (e.g., that a cause precedes its consequence - Bullock and Gelman 1979)" (Shweder, p. 358). Bullock and Gelman show that preschool children (3-5 years) "use temporal order when reasoning about a mechanical sequence of events" (Bullock and Gelman 1979:96), and claim that according to Piaget (1930) "the pre-school child is said to associate or 'juxtapose' phenomena on the basis of contiguity alone; hence he might well believe that causes follow effects" (Bullock and Gelman 1979:89). But in the work referred to, what Piaget actually said was: We shall not go so far as to say, however, that even in the earliest form of the causal relation there is not a feeling of before and after. Indeed, it may be that although cause and effect are infinitely close, the child still refuses to reverse the terms. [Piaget 1930: 269] So here again, while one does not question the experimental findings, they do not refute Piaget because in this case the experimenters did not understand what his position was. Shweder also refers to "many aspects of the concept of causa- tion," but the Bullock and Gelman study was concerned only with temporal succession - what other aspects of Piaget's work on causality have been "refuted" by subsequent research? Finally, it should be noted that in my book I do not even mention a possible confusion of temporal se- quence in causality by primitives or by children. 3. "Four year olds are capable of transitive in- ference and syllogistic reasoning (Trabasso 1975) and various forms of deductive inference in propositional logic (Macnamara, Baker, and Olson 1976)" (Shweder, p. 358), and on the previous page Shweder claims that Macnamara et al. have elicited "formal operations from four year olds." But anyone who expects to find some lisping Aristotles among the tiny tots is due for a disappointment. Trabasso's very interesting material is concerned with seriation and the cognitive strategies underlying it, not with syllogistic reasoning at the level of formal opera- tions, while a grasp of transitivity emerges before the stage of formal operations anyway. The assertion that four-year-olds are capable of deductive inferences in propositional logic and of formal operational thinking goes far beyond the claims of Macnamara et al. themselves. Their results are very difficult to interpret, and in their conclusions they say: Did the mental operations whereby the chil- dren solved the problems in deductive reason- ing involve propositional logic? Here there is very little to go on. The relationships between logical and psychological operations are unknown and exceedingly complex . . . Be- fore he allows that operations are logical at all, Piaget points out, rightly, that the person who employs them must experience a certain necessity about their application. We cannot prove that any of our children had the appro-</page><page sequence="3">658 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [85, 1983] priate experience . . . etc. [Macnamara et al. 1976:69] 4. "Two decades ago Brown (1958) argued that abstraction is a feature of all minds and discussed the way that young children, em- phasizing likenesses and overlooking dif- ferences, apply the same lexical item to things such as leaves, trees, and flowers, an over- generalization from the adult point of view" (Shweder, p. 361). While Shweder does not direct these remarks at any specific statement in my book, we may safely assume that they are in- tended to be uncomplimentary and to imply that in my view primitives are incapable of abstraction. In chapter 5 I devote an admittedly rather difficult section to this problem, and begin by distinguishing between "abstraction" and "generalization" (which Shweder evidently confuses). I further distinguish two senses of "abstraction," and then discuss the different aspects of reality that can be abstracted. I con- clude: There is, then, no such mental function as "abstraction" which primitives, or anyone else, either have or do not have. Abstraction occurs at every level of cognitive functioning and is of three different types--of perceptual properties, of relations, and of proposi, tions . . . [Hallpike 1979:174] 5. "The IKung are an interesting test case for Hallpike's thesis. Blurton-Jones and Konner (1976) conducted "seminars" with the IKung. The seminar topic: IKung Knowledge of Animal Behavior. Blurton-Jones and Konner (ibid.) characterize the IKung in the following terms: they carefully distinguish observed data from hearsay, and they discriminate between data and theory or interpretation. They are willing to admit ignorance. They argue about generaliza- tions. They disbelieve one another. They utilize a number of different classifications of animals, and they readily move from one classification to another. One is tempted to say, "so much for Hallpike's thesis" (Shweder, p. 360). No sensible ethnographer with any field experience at all would suppose for a moment that "distinguish- ing data from hearsay," "admitting ignorance," and "disbelieving one another" were cognitive tasks so demanding as to place them beyond the reach of primitivesl We may therefore dismiss these characteristics of IKung thought as un- doubtedly true but as trivial and quite irrele- vant to my "thesis." "They argue about general- izations" suggests some rarefied philosophical discussion about the nature of universals; what the authors actually say is: They argue about generalizations based on scant data but will try to reach an answer. .... Someone suggested that lions spot and follow the tracks of their prey, and that they know which animal they are follow- ing, whereupon others disagreed as to whether the lion knows which track belongs to which prey. [Blurton-Jones and Konner 1976:329] The generalizations involved are, therefore, of a perfectly simple type which has no implications in terms of cognitive development. "They discriminate between data and theory or interpretation" is only a rather pretentious reformulation of the authors' reference to "their usual distinction between observation and inter- pretation" (ibid.:332). Indeed, theory is an aspect of MKung thought processes that seems conspicuously absent. Blurton-Jones and Kon- ner note "the paucity of explanations alongside great richness of data about animal behav- ior .. ." (ibid.:337); that explanations mostly boil down to anthropomorphic statements that animals do things because they want to (ibid.:334); and they say the general impression gained from these seminars is that !Kung are not particularly in- terested in explanations about behavior or theories about behavior. [p. 333] . . . Is it possible that there is in practice some incom- patibility between a turn of mind geared to theorizing and a turn of mind geared to recording and discussing facts? [ibid.:337] In this respect, the authors' findings tend to support my case. They do, however, refer to a "highly convincing demonstration that the !Kung were able to use a number of different classifications of animals, and to move from one classification to another readily" (ibid.: 336-337), but the only evidence they actually cite is the remark "You were talking about its color; we are talking about its meat; if you want to talk about color then this animal is different" (ibid.:336) which is too brief to be of any diagnostic value. So, far from being a "test case" of my theory, the data given by Blurton-Jones and Konner have scarcely the slightest relevance to it. 6. "The Trobriand Islanders are able to engage in complex causal reasoning without having to wait around for a Trobriand text book in inductive logic (Hutchins 1980)" (Shweder,</page><page sequence="4">COMMENTARIES 659 p. 361). By "complex causal reasoning" Shweder means engaging in lawsuits about land tenure, among other things, but what ethnog- rapher would ever deny such a possibility? If people couldn't make consistent and relevant decisions about property rights, kinship obliga- tions, the allocation of tasks, and so on, no orderly social life would be possible at all. The point is not whether the Trobrianders can operate their society--obviously they can--but the cognitive skills which they employ to do so. One of the essential distinctions that I make in my book is between implicit "knowing how," and the ability to explicitly state that knowledge verbally in an orderly and systematic manner, especially in formal reasoning, but Shweder evidently confuses the two (as did Scheffler (1981) in his review of Hutchins' book). I say: it is evident that in small, face-to-face so- cieties where everyone knows everyone else and in which experience is largely shared by all, the most important and fundamental rules and categories of experience will not, for the most part, need to be given explicit ex- pression, except at the moral level. [Hallpike 1979:110] with the result that speeches and disputations in primitive society tend to take a vast amount of contextual knowledge for granted and to be conducted at a level of specificity that renders them largely opaque to the outsider-by con- trast to our own judicial procedures, for exam- ple. So the protocols of a particular Trobriand lawsuit given by Hutchins (an extremely valuable piece of ethnography) are quite unintelligible without 30 preliminary pages devoted to land tenure and line-by-line explanations of the points made by the protag- onists in the course of the dispute. The modes of argument employed do not therefore conflict with my general characterization of argument in primitive society (Hallpike 1979:117-122). 7. The idea that literacy causes major changes in basic cognitive processes is one of those seductive ideas that deserves to be true, but probably is not. . ... Scribner and Cole (1981) found no support for the view that literacy per se influences "intellectual growth." [Shweder, p. 360] Scribner and Cole's study of unschooled literates (in the Vai syllabary of Liberia) shows clearly that when writing is employed largely in the form of letters to friends and relations, or in keeping lists of money spent, it has few signifi- cant cognitive effects. Extreme claims for the automatic cognitive effects of literacy per se (advanced, for example, by Vygotsky (1962:99) and Greenfield and Bruner (1960:104)) which I cited (Hallpike 1979:128) cannot therefore be sustained in the face of this evidence, but in my book I placed the primary emphasis on school- ing, and also made the following reservation on the effects of literacy: "Nor does literacy itself provide some magic talisman by which pro- operatory thought can be transcended. It depends on the use to which literacy is put -. ." (ibid.:131). 8. "Hallpike also notes that children are 'unable to distinguish names and words from their referents' and that, similarly, primitives believe that words and names are 'indissociable' from the things they denote" (Shweder, p. 362). Shweder goes on to quote a discussion with Vai informants, who were asked if it were possible to interchange the names of the sun and the moon: As Scribner and Cole note, Aamah [one of the discussants] recognizes that names and things are independent concepts but rejects on theological grounds the idea that names are arbitrarily assigned or should be dis- sociated from their referents . . . Very little insight into this Vai [actually Muslim] "theology" is gained by telling us what Piaget said young children are "unable" to do. [Shweder, p. 362] I quite agree, but why does Shweder suppose that I would apply Piaget in this instance? In my book, I emphasize the importance of distin- guishing between the content of beliefs and underlying cognitive abilities and say "it is essential to distinguish between what is believed in and the way in which these beliefs are arrived at and justified" (Hallpike 1979:65). The man, Aamah, is described by Scribner and Cole as "an influential man who could knowledgeably dispute interpretations of Liberian law and Qur'anic commentary" (Scribner and Cole 1981:142), and it would be as inappropriate to class such a man as a "nominal realist" in Piage- tian terms as it would be to claim that educated Christians who accept the miracle of the Feed- ing of the Five Thousand cannot conserve quan- tityl I would, therefore, accept Shweder's claim (derived from Shweder and LeVine 1975) that Hausa adult beliefs that dreams are veridical ac- counts of the soul's experiences are probably not the result of conceptual realism, since some Hausa ten-year-olds can appreciate the subjec-</page><page sequence="5">660 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [85, 1983] tive nature of dreams. Here, cultural elabora- tion seems primarily responsible for the adult beliefs in question, though how far the Hausa are typical in this respect, of course, remains to be seen. This, indeed, is about the only significant point that Shweder establishes throughout his entire article, and I do not think that such meager gleanings justify the continuation of this ordeal. Shweder does not understand my book, or Piaget, and the references to developmental psychology and to ethnography are almost in- variably irrelevant, or gross distortions of what those cited actually said. In the course of his ar- ticle Shweder exhorts LUvi-Strauss, Whorf, and Durkheim to "take heart" from his support. They should be embarrassed by it. REFERENCES CITED Beidelman, T.
