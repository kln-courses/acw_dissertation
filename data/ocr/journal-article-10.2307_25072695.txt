<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fictitious Persons and Real Responsibilities Kevin Gibson ABSTRACT. I believe that corporations should be held responsible for their actions. Traditional discus sions about the moral responsibility of an organiza tion have relied on a model of criminal intent. Demonstrating intent demands that we find a moral agent capable of intending, and this has led to problems. Here I replace the analysis based on criminal law by one based on tort law. Under this framework I suggest that corporations can be held responsible for the harms caused by their activities even if no person or persons in their decision making structure had formed malicious intent, since the sheer fact that the corporate environment encouraged or allowed negligence will be sufficient. Fictitious persons and real responsibilities Corporations cannot commit treason, nor be outlawed, nor excommunicated, for they have no souls.1 People who deal in ethics sometimes have difficulties that are not apparent to the general public. The concept of blaming or praising a company makes sense to the average person, so that it is perfectly reasonable to claim, for example, that "Pepsi acted responsibly during the recent tampering hoax". Furthermore, it is clear that companies make deals, have spokespersons, and are taken to court. Companies are not people, but they are sufficiently like people to Kevin Gibson is an Assistant Professor and associate of the Center for Ethics at Marquette University, Milwaukee. Dr. Gibson's research interests are in applied ethics, including business ethics and the ethics of negotiation. He is presently working on a major study examining unintended moral lapses. be regarded as agents which act in the social environment. Where, then, is the problem for ethicists? The issue centers around the issue of "corporate personhood". The law treats a company like a person, albeit a fictional one. If pressed, most people would say that what they mean by saying that a company acted well or badly is that members of the corporation, espe cially those who have influence, did well or badly. Thus, on the one hand, corporate per sonhood turns out to be a convenient invention so that issues of legal responsibility may be sorted out, or, alternatively, it is just a shorthand way of describing the actions of individuals. But I propose more than either of these claims. I contend that it also makes sense to say that the corporation is itself a moral agent, so that the claim that it is praiseworthy or blameworthy is not always reducible to a claim about the acts of members of the corporation. So, for example, I will say that it is intelligible to propose that the Ford Motor Company ? and not only the signifi cant human actors involved ? was morally blameworthy in marketing a car (the Pinto) with known design flaws. In some cases, corporate action has been reprehensible, although no individual can be held accountable, and my model will allow us to meaningfully pass moral judgement on the corporation. Thus in 1984 when National Semiconductor was charged with inadequately testing supplies for the Defense Department, president Charles Sporch is quoted as saying that no individual should be singled out because the behavior was "an industry pattern beyond any one individual's responsibility".2 This sort of claim suggests that blame is inappropriate when it cannot be affixed to a particular moral agent. However, I believe that Sporch was wrong Journal of Business Ethics 14: 761-767, 1995. ? 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">762 Kevin Gibson and we can treat corporations as moral agents, just as we treat other people as deserving praise or blame. The fact that we cannot point out any particular person does not necessarily mean that we dissolve the blame. It is in this vein that the Continental Oil Company's in-house booklet on moral standards says: No one can deny that in the public's mind a corporation can break the law and be guilty of unethical and amoral conduct . . . Perhaps it is then appropriate in today's context to think of Conoco as a living corporation; a sentient being whose conduct and personality are the collective effort and responsibility of its officers, directors and shareholders.3 Other models have attempted to say that the corporation is a moral agent, but they quickly bog down in a debate about whether or not a corporation is an entity which has the capacity to intend things.4 I will put forward a model which does not rely on so-called "intentionality", but still preserves the grounds on which we can blame or praise a corporation over and above the individuals who make it up. Immediately, let me say that I do not want to excuse individuals or allow individuals to abdicate their obvious moral obligations. Rather, I want to say that there are cases where no individual or group is found to be blameworthy and yet we want to maintain that moral as well as legal culpability is appropriate. I do not preclude the possibility of individual responsibility, and would take pains to establish it where appropriate. For example, if there was a specific memorandum which detailed an executive's decision to market an unsafe product, then I do not want to thwart investigation, prosecution, or moral disapproba tion. I do want, however, to permit the addi tional moral censure of a company whose culture allows or condones poor behavior in addition to the individual perpetrator of an immoral act.5 I will briefly sketch the two main models used in dealing with corporate personhood in order to show that despite their differences they hold assumptions in common, and both center on the issue of intentionality. I will lay out a model which allows for corporate personhood that does not depend on intentionality. I conclude that it is entirely proper to say, for instance. "Pepsi acted in a admirable way" even if no particular individual within Pepsi can be singled out as having acted admirably and even if PepsiCo. is an entity incapable of intending anything. The reducibility approach In his article "Why Corporations Are Not Morally Responsible for Anything They Do" Velasquez says . . . moral responsibility for an act attaches to the entity that originates the act - i.e., the entity that formed the intention to bring about the act and that carried out the intention by its direct bodily movements ... To say that a corporation is morally responsible for some wrongful act, then, is but an elliptical way of saying (if what one is saying makes sense) that some people within the corporation are morally responsible for the act; it is not a way of attributing moral responsibility to some entity or structure called "the corporation" or to the entire corporate membership ... It is thus incorrect to attribute moral responsibility to the corporation as such (Velasquez, 1983) Thus Velasquez believes that talk about cor porate moral responsibility is anthropomorphic, but meaningless. Sentences such as "Dow Corning is at fault for not disclosing all they knew about silicone implants" or "Union Carbide can be blamed for the Bhopal disaster" are just grammatical tricks, which are essentially empty, or they are meaningful in that they are reducible to sentences which only concern individuals within the firm. If we want to attribute blameworthiness we should find the individual or individuals within the corporation who intended an act and carried it through. So it is claimed it makes no sense to suggest that a corporation is a moral agent, capable of playing in the moral arena; all we have is a collection of individuals, and they are the locus of the moral action. To make claims about the corporation as such would be to commit what Gilbert Ryle called a "category mistake" (Ryle, 1954). The lingering question, though, is whether there may be corporate acts which are not attributable to</page><page sequence="3">Fictitous Persons and Real Responsibilities 763 persons. For instance, it might be the case that no individual or even collection of individuals ever made a decision which resulted in harms caused by a company product. Perhaps the incident at Bhopal cannot be blamed on any set of individual moral agents, and yet, I suggest, it still would make sense to say the company is responsible for the accident. The CID approach A contrasting approach is typified by Peter French. In an elaborate and comprehensive theory, he attempts to rehabilitate the notion of corporate intentionality. He says that corpora tions have "internal decision" structures or CIDs which amount to ways in which corporations set goals and implement them. Effectively, these decision structures can be determined by exam ining the organizational chart of each company and its stated policies. French claims that a struc ture absorbs the intentions and acts (or omissions) of individual persons into a "corporate decision". Thus we can get decisions which are not made by any one individual, and which may not reflect any individual intention, yet these decisions are sufficient to create a corporate intention (French, 1979) The model of criminal behavior When we look at these approaches their problems stem from the elusive intender. Either there is one, but it needs to be adequately described, or it is a phantasm which leaves us no way to say that corporations are entities capable of being moral agents (and hence the search for morally responsible entities shifts elsewhere). Yet when look at the terms in which the debate is framed, we find that whether or not commen tators agree that corporations can be morally responsible, they share a common baseline of analysis which is taken to be axiomatic. The basic model that they use to establish moral responsi bility is one which approximates that of criminal liability, and, roughly, it is as follows: To be morally responsible one must show two things, knowledge of the situation and intent. Intent requires an intender. Therefore to assign moral responsibility we need to locate the agent who can intend things. To establish criminal liability we need to prove (1) intent and (2) awareness, and this is the framework that is generally used in debates about corporate moral responsibility. Hence French looks to the corporate intentional decision struc ture, or Velasquez looks to aware - and intending - individuals. The model is attractive, but inevitably will narrow the focus of the debate. The tort model My alternative replaces the criminal model with one of tortious responsibility. In torts, culpability is no longer tied to intent. Consider an example: A worker makes a rude gesture at his manager, who is driving along in his car. The manager, enraged but rational, runs over the worker. There we have a case of criminal wrongdoing. In another case, an exec utive absent-mindedly leaves his car on a sloping driveway, it then rolls backwards and kills a passing pedestrian. Here, too, we want to say that there is blame, but that there is a different sort of proof that is required. In the second case, we do not have to show intent to kill the pedestrian, but rather a duty of care that is violated by such things as negligence, carelessness, lack of fore thought or even insensitivity, and a causal link between the failure to properly care and the harm that was done. Most cases of business responsibility are more like the second example than the first. I doubt that any moral agent wanted to blow up the Challenger, or intended the terrible injuries that resulted from the gas leak at Bhopal. But even in the absence of intent, we still hold agents blameworthy on these tortious criteria. It is possible, then, to establish blameworthi ness in the absence of intent, and therefore in examining corporate responsibility we can eliminate the need to always find an intender. In a case of wrongdoing, both the criminal and</page><page sequence="4">764 Kevin Gibson tort models can trace legal responsibility to the perpetrator. The key difference is that in terms of moral accountability we only have to find an entity which has a set of norms, and not neces sarily one which has the ability to formulate intentions and carry them out. In order to bring my model to life, though, two elements have to be established: Tortious liability still requires a tortfeasor, and we also need to show that the corporation demonstrates an attitude which is praiseworthy or blame worthy. Thus we have to show (1) There is something called a corporation which is more than the collection of individuals, and (2) That the corporation has something called a culture. I will address these points in turn: Corporate identity In effect, the company is like an organic entity. It is not static, but it reacts to and changes with altering circumstances. It has an identity separate from the individuals of whom it consists, and it survives the inclusion and exclusion of such individuals. There may be a continuity of values within the organization. Potential recruits are often assessed in terms of the way their values and behaviors fit those of the company. Often the corporate "mission" statement does not reflect the direct best interest of any individual in the company, but is instead geared to long term survival and benefit of the company itself.6 Hence the corporation may not be reducible to just a collection of individuals; it has a life of its own.7 Corporate culture There is more to many corporate institutions than a set of working relationships among indi viduals. This is captured in the concept of corporate culture. A corporate culture may be thought of as a unifying set of beliefs and values which define an institution. W. Brooke Tunstall of AT&amp;T describes it as a general constellation of beliefs, mores, customs, value systems, behavioral norms, and ways of doing business that are unique to each corporation, that set a pattern for corporate activities and actions, and that describe the implicit and emergent patterns of behavior and emotions characterizing life in the organization. (Tunstall, 1983) Thus a corporate culture has norms which act as guidelines for conduct; they are widespread within an organization; and they may be articu lated or implicit. Consider a young graduate joining a company like IBM. She arrives and finds that there people dress alike, that some behaviors are unacceptable, and that there is a belief system about the company and its mission that permeates the organization. If she is to progress, she has to become acculturated to the organization. Not all of the rules are explicit, and she is sometimes forced to "read between the lines". If she is sensitive to the organizational values, she is likely to do well. If not, she may be regarded as not being an IBM-type, even though what that type is may never be openly articulated. Culture exists and will affect the way people behave in the workplace especially when situations are new or faced under pressure. As Denison (1990) notes Emphasis on a few general, value-based principles, on which actions can be grounded, enables indi viduals to better react in a predictable way to an unpredictable environment.8 "Value-based" does not necessarily mean morally good, of course. The values that a culture may foster could easily include a heavy task orienta tion, or a commitment to deliver on time whatever the quality. Corporate culture as I described it is signifi cantly different from French's corporate inten tionality: it can be determined without reference to an organizational chart or the decision-making locus of a corporation.9 Corporate culture speaks to the moral climate of an organization, and descriptions of culture need not make reference to the corporate structure. Indeed there are cases where companies like Tandem Computers apparently have "no formal organization chart and few formal rules" although they still have a high level of productivity because of "the</page><page sequence="5">Fictitous Persons and Real Responsibilities 765 unwritten rules and shared understandings." (Kennedy and Deal, 1982). Corporate disposition It is through the notion of corporate culture that we can say a corporation was acting in such a way as to allow blameworthy acts to occur; that is, there was an environment that would tolerate certain behavior which then led to particular consequences. Essentially, my model looks more at the disposition of a company rather than its intent. The revised notion of corporate respon sibility, then, is more along the lines of an amended proposition: To show an organization to be morally responsible it is necessary to demonstrate that the organiza tional culture allowed or condoned unreasonable behavior and that the behavior was causally linked to harmful consequences. There is an obvious difficulty in establishing that such an environment existed: however it is not impossible to prove, and for this I will make an analogy to legislation on sexual harassment. In a seminal case, Bundy v. Jackson, the court found that the plaintiff did not have to prove that any particular act occurred, but rather it was sufficient to prove that there was a pervasive environment in which it could have occurred. The court declared that discrimination. [W]e believe that an affirmative answer [as to whether sexual discrimination has taken place] follows ineluctably from numerous cases finding Title VII violations where an employer created or condoned a substantially discriminatory work environment, regardless of whether the complaining employees lost any tangible job benefits as a result of the discrimination. (Bundy v. Jackson 641 F.2d.934 (1981)) [emphasis added] Whether the employer is taken to be an indi vidual or a corporation, the significance of this ruling is that it moves away from notions of harm which require findings of intent, awareness, and specific actions, to one where investigating the work environment is the fundamental element in assessing the justifiability of censure. In effect it no longer matters whether the employer is a person or a corporation, since we have moved away from notions of intent and the material question now becomes one about the attitudes demonstrated at work. In short, the tortious model, as opposed to the criminal one, allows us to assign blame (or else praise) to corporations without the complex manoeuvering that is demanded when we need to find an individual or collective intender. My model contrasts with the conclusions of Velasquez in that I think it is correct to assert that corporations can have responsibility in a strong sense. I agree with French that corpora tions can have intent, but unlike him I do not believe that intention is absolutely necessary. Consequently I believe that his formulation of the problem is often over-determined and may fail to properly describe the concept of corpo rate responsibility. Two objections Two objections might be raised to my model. The first is that by looking to a corporate culture I am, in fact, acquitting guilty individuals. This is a possible, but not necessary consequence of my analysis. Individuals are moral agents and should be held responsible for their actions. However individuals are not the only moral agents at work in the business environment. My model allows us to judge all the actors on the moral stage, rather than looking for one or more persons - and only persons - responsible for allowing the act to occur. A similar objection might be that 'tort' culpability is somehow lesser than 'criminal' culpability. However, my model does not prevent an attempt to show blamewor thiness based on the aware intentional acts of an individual or group of individuals. Instead it provides a way to assign blame when the criminal model is no longer appropriate. Take the case of the car that rolls back: if it had been a deliberate - but cunningly disguised - way of killing the pedestrian we might want to say that the car owner was a worse person than if he had been purely negligent. But it would be wrong to force</page><page sequence="6">766 Kevin Gibson intentionality where there is none. So if the owner was negligent, but not maliciously so, we would be foolish to look for evil intent, and it would be appropriate to adopt another standard for assessing behavior, which in this case might be the failure to maintain a reasonable standard of care. A second objection might be that guilt is so diluted through a generalized sense of moral responsibility that it will not affect any individual. This is a serious but not pernicious objection. The key is that we have to ask "compared to what?" In the case of institutional sloppiness where a poor product results in fatality, the present formulations of corporate responsibility fall short; under Velasquez's terms we may not be able to trace any individual to whom respon sibility may be assigned, and under French's framework we might be unable to trace any decision-making, although there was a general institutional attitude of laxity about quality. My formulation may have the effect of diluting blame, but it does nevertheless provide a way to place the blame on corporations where every individual is able to avoid personal association with a blameworthy act or decision. Advantages One of the chief advantages of the tortious approach is that it allows us to develop and use the notion of a 'reasonable corporation' as a moral yardstick, similar to the 'reasonable person' standard used in torts. A reasonable person should not fail to apply the brake to a vehicle parked on a slope, and in just the same way a corpora tion should not, for example, market a product that is dangerous because of an attitude of "getting it out the door as quickly as possible". Additionally, we can be agnostic about corporate intentions, since it is sufficient to show that the corporate environment fostered such an attitude. It may be difficult to demonstrate a poor or unreasonable work environment. Still, it would often be easier to show a track record of behav iors, attitudes, and consequences that add up to a culpable corporate environment than it is to prove awareness and intentionality on the part of the corporation.10 Conclusion In conclusion, I believe that my formulation has the following benefits: a. It allows that corporations can have respon sibility in a strong sense. b. It is more reflective of our views of what goes on in corporations - that is, it is not strictly geared only to the stated corporate policy and flow chart. c. It is truer to our general ideas of respon sibility, in that we don't hold people to a standard of criminal responsibility, but think a tortious standard is sufficient. Also this allows us a conception of what a reasonable company would be, instead of having to rely on whether a company had evil intent. d. My formulation is more compatible with the way that we actually treat corporations, as in the Bundy case.11 Notes 1 Sir Edward Coke, 'Suttons Hospital Case', 10 Rep. 32 (1612). 2 Paul Richter: 1984, 'Pentagon Lifts Threat to Ban National Semi' Los Angeles Times August 8, part IV, p. 1 ; cited in William Shaw and Vincent Barry Moral Issues In Business p. 183, Wadsworth, Belmont CA 1989. 3 'The Conoco Conscience', Continental Oil Company 1976, quoted in Goodpaster and Matthews (1982). 4 See, Peter A. French: 1979, 'The Corporation as a Moral Person', American Philosophical Quarterly 16(3), pp. 207-215. Similar analyses based on internal decision structures are found, for example, in Donaldson (1982) or Werhane and Donaldson (1988). 3 I am thinking of some recent insider trading scandals where the individual was prosecuted and the firm effectively "washed its hands" of the dealings. My feeling is that it would be difficult for individ uals to defraud to an immense extent without some</page><page sequence="7">Fictitous Persons and Real Responsibilities 767 institutional "blind eye" being turned to the activity. My analysis allows censure of the firm for allowing such behavior, even if it was the primarily the fault of specific individuals. 6 The CEO is perhaps the individual who can best shape the culture. Still in many cases the CEO is a steward of the culture, and within the company individuals shape their behaviors to comport with those of the organization, since these will be rewarded, and behavior at odds with the culture will attract penalties. See, for analysis and discussion, Kotter and Heskett (1992); Denison (1990); Schein (1985); Graves (1986). 7 Despite his belief that corporate responsibility must be reducible, Velasquez admits in a footnote to the article that "it is wrong to try to "reduce" a cor poration to its members ... I also do not hold that the acts of a corporation can be "reduced" without remainder to the acts of its members." (Velasquez, 1983 footnote #11). I find this incongruous. 8 Corporate Culture and Organizational Effectiveness, p. 9. 9 French distinguishes the CID structure from "basic policy" in the workplace. He says the organizational chart provides "the grammar of corporate decision making" whereas the "internal recognition rules" (or basic beliefs and policies of the organization) provide its logic. Even though French incorporates some notion of corporate culture, he uses corporate culture as a means of actuating the CID, which remains the cardinal element in his analysis. 10 I have purposely used corporations as my instance of non-human persons. I see no philosophical problem with using the same analysis for unions, states, churches or other collective bodies. 11 I benefitted from discussions with Peter French in developing the analysis. I am also greatly indebted to Professor John Leslie of Guelph University for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.
