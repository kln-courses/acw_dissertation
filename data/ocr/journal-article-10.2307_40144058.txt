<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alberto Julian Perez. Poetica de la prosa de J . L. Borges: Hacia una critica bakhtiniana de la literatura. Madrid. Gre- dos. 1986. 302 pages. As the subtitle indicates, the late Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin is the guiding spirit behind Alberto Julian Perez's methodical study of Borges's fictions (Fic- ciones, El Aleph, El Informe de Brodie, and El libro de arena). The first section deals with the literary representa- tion of characters, making a surprising but valuable distinc- tion between Borges's anthropomorphic creations and the "personaje no antropomorfico: la idea." Next comes an ex- amination of "el cronotopo narrativo ' (the term chronotope or "space-time" was borrowed by Bakhtin from Einstein; see Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination, University of Texas Press, 1981). Perez identifies a number of "simbolos cronoto- picos" in Borges - the road, the labyrinth, the library - and describes their various uses. In the third chapter, "El discurso narrativo, ' we are in- troduced to Bakhtin's ideas on what he called heteroglossia, defined as "el sitio donde chocan las tendencias centripetas (centralization) y centrifugas (dispersion) actuantes en el discurso"; the concept is here used to particularize Borges's relationship to language and, by definition, to society. The final section, "Los generos discursivos," is an application of Bakhtin's theory of speech genres to Borges's fictions. Here we find many useful observations: "Borges menosprecia la poetica del realismo" and thus will naturally eschew primary discourse, such as dialogue, in favor of secondary forms such as the polemic, the confession, et cetera. Although Perez's study clearly contains much of value, it suffers - as does Bakhtin - from an excess of scientific postur- ing on matters that simply do not lend themselves to quantifi- cation. Perez's catalogues of Borges's procedures are often composed of unlike elements, a rhetorical fault that Borges himself was not slow to parody. Perez: "Los procedimientos que Borges utiliza para representar la idea son: 1) la hiper- bole, 2) el sistema, 3) la clasificacion, 4) la enumeration y la yuxtaposicion, 5) el dialogo o polemica oculta. " Discussion under each rubric is intelligent, but one wonders whether the divisions may not at times be as arbitrary as those of, say, Bishop Wilkins.
