<plain_text><page sequence="1">BACK TO DESCARTESI PROFESSOR A. E. TAYLOR I MUST explain at once that these few pages do not attempt or pretend to be anything like a formal review of the recently published posthumous volume of Professor Bowman with the same title. I am precluded from writing such a review partly by the wide range of problems attacked by the author, partly by my own insufficient familiarity with many of the positions of the most recent physical and natural science which are brought under review I will there- fore confine myself, so far as the strict business of the reviewer is concerned, to the single remark that the editor, Professor J. W. Scott, has discharged his difficult task of preparing the book for publication-no easy matter, as will be seen from his Preface-with equal skill and devotion, and has laid himself open to no worse criticism than that there are less than a dozen obvious slight mis- prints which have escaped detection, but will readily be detected by a careful reader. What I propose to do in the remarks which follow is simply to indicate the very real importance of the book by saying something as to its main purpose and thesis, and the points where I still feel that there is some difficulty or ambiguity about the writer's position which would, no doubt, have been largely cleared up if he had lived to reconstruct the whole six of his Vanuxem Lectures for publication as he has done the first three. In a way, one may say that the motto for the whole might not improperly have been "Back to Descartes," a great philosopher who has fallen for a generation or more into some disrepute. We are all familiar enough with the complaint-some of us may, to some extent, have urged it ourselves-that Descartes definitely sent philosophers for generations on a false scent by his hard-and-fast dualism of the "extended" and "thinking" substances. Nothing has been more characteristic of some of the most distinctive philosophies of the past generation than the reaction against this Cartesian doc- trine of the two substances with antithetically contrasted attributes. The reaction against it has perhaps most commonly been motivated by the "naturalistic" purpose of dethroning "mind" or "thought" from its solitary pre-eminence. One can trace this tendency notably in the work of Santayana, Whitehead, and Alexander, all of whom come in for much trenchant criticism at Bowman's hands. But the motive has not always been the "naturalistic" one. The attack has I A Sacramental Universe. A. A. Bowman (Oxford University Press), 1939. I26</page><page sequence="2">BACK TO DESCARTES sometimes been conducted, as in Professor Gilson's recent Unity of Philosophical Experience-a volume published, of course, since the delivery of these Vanuxem Lectures-in the interests of the neo- Thomism which at the present moment seems to have so great a future before it. One can trace its influence, again, in the insistence that mind, as we are acquainted with it, is always embodied mind which runs through such a volume as Professor Stout's Mind and Matter as its dominant theme, though neither Gilson nor Stout is, in any sense of the phrase, a " naturalistic" thinker. What Bowman was anxious to maintain, as against all these critics, is that, with all the error involved in his doctrine of the two antithetic substances, Descartes was fundamentally in the right in opposing the "physical" and the "subjective" to one another as ultimately irreducible modes of being. Nothing that is physical is "subjective" and nothing that is "subjective" is physical; any failure to recognize this fundamental duality of modalities of being is bound to lead, and Bowman argues, as I think with success, that it does lead in differing degrees, in the cases of Santayana, Whitehead, and Alexander, to a much more radical and incurable dualism than any it is meant to remove. Only for the two supposed "substances" we must substitute two opposed systems, the one composed of experiences, the other of physical events which have nothing in common with experiences beyond the fact that they occupy time (according to Bowman, a common character of all that is). The strictly physical system is strictly not mind-dependent, and the system of experiences, that which con- stitutes personality, is in no sense dependent on the physical. Each is, in Whitehead's language, "closed against" the other. What a purely physical system consists of is, in the last resort, sub-micro- scopic events taking place over the four-fold continuum of " space- time," undulations of which the nature is disclosed to us by the latest developments of the quantum-theory. A " subjective" system is one of which the constituent items are not undulations but expe- riences. This is not to say that they are all "conscious states"; on the contrary, there is a vast amount of subjective activity of which we are unconscious. But we are unconscious of it, in a very special way; for example, my unconsciousness when I have forgotten a name and am trying unsuccessfully to remember it, is specifically different from the unconsciousness we attribute to a stick or a stone. I actually have a conscious experience of what it means to be unconscious of that name. (So, I suppose, we may also say that when I wake from a sound sleep I am conscious of the change of my con- dition. I know that I have waked, and thus have the consciousness of what it means to have been asleep.) Thus we may say that the characteristic differentia of "unconscious mental processes" is that they differ from the "unconscious states" of senseless things in I27</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY being able to enter as constituent elements into a homogeneous system which includes conscious processes. The fundamental notions of the author's philosophy are thus those of a homogeneous system and of the functionally related elements which are its constituents. All these elements are assumed in every case to have what is regarded as the most universal character of all being; all of them are events or processes occupying time. Such elements are said to be functionally related when what one of them is depends in any way upon what another is, or others are, and a set of elements thus functionally related form a system. It is a homo- geneous system when all its constituent elements have one and the same modality of being, which is also that of the system as a whole, so that the system and each and all of its elements have the same modality. A priori we could set no bounds to the number of possible different modalities, but in fact we know of only two, and therefore of only two coherent homogeneous systems, the physical, as disclosed to us by the exact sciences, and the "subjective," only known to us certainly as the realm of personality. The physical and subjective systems thus answer in the theory to the extended and the thinking substance of Descartes (or to the two known "attributes" of substance in the scheme of Spinoza. But there is this important difference from Descartes, that the notion of substance is replaced by that of a homogeneous system; a person, for example, is thought of not as the mysterious substratum underlying his own personal activities, but as the unitary system constituted by them. Consequently Bowman is able to avoid the rock on which Cartesianism is wrecked, the conception of a sub- stance which is, in its essentia, unknown, while all that is known is a congeries of accidents of this supposed X. The homogeneous system exists in and manifests itself by the processes which are its elements, and so is known through them, as a man's "personal character," though not identical with any of his actions, is displayed in them all. The universe, however, does not consist simply of homogeneous systems, whether physical or subjective. If it did, of course, each of us, being as a person a homogeneous subjective system, would be in the same position as one of Leibniz's monads, aware of his own internal development and of nothing else. But in fact each of us is aware not only of his fellows but of the inanimate environ- ment of things and events in the midst of which our life is set. Hence we have to think of reality as a whole as a heterogeneous system in which events themselves subjective are conditioned by others which are non-subjective, and vice versa. Mind is, in fact, compresent in the universe with the non-mental. This compresence is again only possible in virtue of a more intimate functional con- I28</page><page sequence="4">BACK TO DESCARTES nection, of a kind which must in the end remain a mystery for us, of the mental and the non-mental, in fact of the existence of embodied personalities. This explains the title given to these lectures. The physical order is, by definition, not mind-dependent, and the subjective is equally independent of the physical. No scouting of physical facts, however subtle, throws any light upon either the existence or the destiny of experiencing subjects. But the experiencing subjects with which we have actual acquaintance, whatever their origin or destiny, are embodied selves. Through their embodiment the physical order, itself, as the author assumes, one of monotonous and purposeless vibrations or exhalations, becomes charged with significance and meaning, with sensible qualities and "values," which it could not have if it stood alone, and only acquires in virtue of the existence of the embodied self. Nature is thus something more than the merely physical, and, as distinguished from the merely physical, is in a real sense mind- dependent or mind-conditioned. For the sensible qualities and the values, utilitarian, aesthetic, or moral and religious, though they would not be there but for the existence of the embodied selves who discern them, are discerned as characters of that which is appre- hended, not of the subject which apprehends it. (The colour and fragrance of the rose would be non-existent if there were not per- cipients with organs of vision and smell, but still they belong to the rose; it is the rose, not the percipient, which is crimson or scented.) Nature as a whole is thus sacramental in the sense that it is a system of values revealed or ministered to embodied percipients by a physical order, but not belonging to the physical order inde- pendently and of its own right. Yet we are not reduced to an ultimate metaphysical dualism like that of the Cartesian two substances. The escape from such a dualism is provided by theism with its conception of divine creativity. In the last resort we have to think of the physical itself as the creation of the supreme divine person- ality. For deity is no other than being at the full height of its plenitude, and therefore-a reformulation of the familiar "onto- logical argument"-has no raison d'etre other than itself. But the physical is being reduced to the minimum at which it is on the very point of vanishing into nonentity (as Blake would have said, "to the limit of 'opakeness' "), and its raison d'etre has to be sought outside itself in the fuller being from which it is a "remission"; a conception of creation which, as the editor notes, is curiously neo- Platonic. I have tried in these few sentences to offer without comment a necessarily very brief and inadequate statement of what I take to be the writer's main line of thought in detachment from the many incidental side-arguments into which he is led in the cause of an I I29</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY exposition where it is sometimes a little difficult "to see the wood for the trees." I propose to add a few remarks concerned partly with the points on which I for one feel Bowman to have made out his case once and for all, partly with others where I am still con- scious of difficulties or of uncertainties which might in large part have been removed if the author had lived to complete the prepara- tion of his own manuscript for publication. Further, as to points of agreement, I will only mention a few which seem to me of special importance. I should like to congratulate Bowman on a fundamental improvement in terminology which obviates many common confusions. He rightly, in my opinion, abandons the traditional antithesis between subjective and objective on the sound ground that anything whatever which can be made the object of reflection and study is properly to be called objective, and that we can notoriously thus make our own personality, character, intimate personal activities, objects of reflection; hence the subjective is as objective as anything else. The true antithesis is between the subjective and the physical, that residuum in nature which is wholly other than mind-dependent, the "matter," so to say, of the sacrament which is nature. This may seem at first a very simple change of nomenclature, but it enables the author to avoid a host of tiresome ambiguities which beset the traditional employ- ment of the word objective. This being premised, Bowman is, as it seems to me, wholly right in his main contention that existence as a subject of experience is a fundamental "modality of being" irreducible to any other and in his prolonged and acute criticism of the well-known contemporary thinkers who have tried to eliminate or minimize the antithesis between the "subjective" and the "physical." He is right in principle here, I believe, as against some distinguished writers who are not quite the objects of any direct criticism in this volume, when he insists that nothing can be at once a constituent term of the sub- jective and of the physical "modalities." This has always seemed to me a fatal objection, for example, to the account of sensa in so excellent a work as Professor Stout's Mind and Matter. I have never, in spite of many re-readings, really understood what sensa as described by Stout are, but it is at least clear that they are taken to be either at once both "mental" and "physical" or to be neither. Thus Stout tells us that when "the straight oar looks bent" in the water, there are (I) something which is straight but looks bent, and this is the physical thing, the oar, and (2) something which is bent, and this is the sensum." My difficulty is that (a) I cannot feel at all sure that, in the case supposed, there is anything at all which not merely looks but is bent, and (b) that if there is something which is bent, when I try to say more precisely what 130</page><page sequence="6">BACK TO DESCARTES this something can be, it always turns out to be a problematic something (e.g. an "image on the retina") which is not "sensed" at all-since I certainly do not look at images on my own retina-and is definitely physical and not mental. Hence I am, rightly or wrongly, quite in agreement with Bowman in the further view-I do not know whether Stout would concur with it or not-that however true it may be that all my experience of self is that of an embodied self, this throws no decisive light on the question whether such embodiment is more than an episode in the history of a self. So far as I can see, considerations like those dwelt on by Stout do not even prove that there may not be other episodes in my own personal history in which I shall exist unembodied (as a "parted soul"). I could find it in my heart to wish that Bowman had included in his critical examination a detailed statement of his own attitude towards the doctrine expounded in Stout's Mind and Matter, since, though always leaving me profoundly dissatisfied, it has always seemed to me far and away the ablest of all the contemporary attempts to overcome the radical antithesis of the physical and the subjective (to use Bowman's terminology) by discovering something which is either at once "mental" and "bodily" or is neither, exactly as you like to take it. A second point of supreme importance, where I find myself again unreservedly on the side of our author, is that his philosophy is defi- nitely an existence-philosophy. The "postulate of being" (or exis- tence) must from the first be made for the constituent elements of any "modality" which we can make the object of our study. There must be no ultimate antithesis between a realm of immutable but non-existent "essences" and a second realm of existence which is mere flux. Bowman seems to me unanswerable in his contention that Santayana's doctrine of essences, or Whitehead's of eternal objects, only gets rid of a comparatively superficial duality at the cost of introducing a more fundamental dualism which is incurable in principle. The difficulty is the old one which is equally fatal to the Platonic doctrine of the ELS,7, at least as it is commonly under- stood and seems to be expounded in the Phaedo or the Republic; the immutable essence or eternal object and the flux of becoming have been, in such theories, initially so completely sundered from one another that there is no intelligible way of bringing them together again so as to construct from them the simpler ordered and patterned "natural" world in which, when all is said, we live and move and have our daily being; two such halves as these will never make a whole. This is obviously true, for example, of Santayana's "world" (if you can call it a world). "Essences" being what according to him they are, and the realm of "matter" being a mere aTretpov or flux, 131</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY it is left an inexplicable accident that some of the essences should be "exemplified" and others not or that the flux should ever exhibit pattern. If Plato escapes the difficulty at all, he seems only to do so by falling back on the imagery used for example in the Timaeus, where God puts pattern into the flux by moulding it on the model of the E'[$r, and the employment of this imagery at once brings us up against the apparently insoluble problem whether Plato's Theism and his "doctrine of Ideas" can be adjusted so as to present a single intelligible picture. A third point of fundamental importance, where once more I find myself in complete concurrence, is that it is necessarily implied by the whole doctrine that all consciousness involves the subject's awareness of its own subjective being as well as awareness of objects (which may be independent of mind); all consciousness is, in its degree, self-consciousness. The point is, to my thinking, irrefutably established by means of the important distinction between primary self-consciousness (the self's awareness of itself as an experiencing subject) and secondary self-consciousness (awareness of self as an object of reflection), which is a later development only reached apparently, to our certain knowledge, by human selves. Bowman does not remark in this con- nection, as I think he would have been entitled to do, that if authority is wanted for such a doctrine, it can fairly appeal to the name of Aristotle. In my youthful days at Oxford one used to be told, in the spirit of T. H. Green, that the all-important difference between myself and my dog or cat is that the animal, though conscious of shapes, smells, colours, sounds, is wholly without self-consciousness. The animal mind was apparently taken to be no more than what Hume falsely called the humanl mind, a sequence or collection of "impressions" succeeding one another with incredible rapidity. But if one turns from Green to the de Anima, one is at once struck by the difference between Aristotle's and what I may call Green's view of self-consciousness. In Green's view self-consciousness is identical with the power of conceiving one's self as an object for thought, thinking about one's self; the cat or dog, which does not think, therefore cannot be conscious of self, and Green seems always to assume further that a creature which cannot think about itself cannot be a self. (This is, of course, far from obvious. One would be inclined to retort that one must be a self before one can think of one's self as one, just as one must be alive before one can know or think that one is alive.) But in Aristotle there is no such exclusive restriction of self-consciousness to beings who can think. It is plainly his doctrine that, apart from thought altogether, a complete act of sensation involves consciousness of self as one of its constituents; whatever alacrdveEra alcradvera ort alaOdverat, just as whatever voEl 132</page><page sequence="8">BACK TO DESCARTES VOE OL VOEL. The difference between my dog and myself is not that the dog has not consciousness of self, whereas I have, but that the dog's self-consciousness is not, like mine, a noetic self-consciousness. It has always seemed to me that in this matter Aristotle is clearly right and Green wrong, and Bowman, I think, has happily put his finger on the source of Green's error. It is that when Green writes of consciousness of self he always means exclusively the genetically secondary consciousness of self as an object of contemplation, and completely ignores its presupposition, primary awareness of self, not as a contemplated object but as apprehending subject. The pages devoted to the vindication of this primary self-consciousness as inseparable from all consciousness seem to me one of the most valuable sections of the whole work. Even the professed psychologist is still only too often prone to forget that we do not originally make acquaintance with our own selfhood as one among other "objects presented to our notice." Even when he is engaged in refuting Hume, he too often allows the extreme "presentationism" which is at the root of Hume's attempt to get rid of the "idea" of self as non- existent to pass without sufficient exposure. As this particular doctrine is one against which I have long found it important to protest in my University teaching, I am profoundly thankful to have it so fully and, as I venture to think, finally dismissed. A fourth point I would single out for special commendation is the treatment of time which runs through the chapters of Metaphysical Prolegomena. Here again we are concerned with getting rid of mis- conceptions which seem to be a sort of aftermath of the Humian positivism, the reduction of time to mere succession. The first and most obvious criticism on this confusion of time with mere succes- siveness is, of course, that which has so often been made, that even the time of natural history, geology, astronomy, is marked by duration no less than by succession, and that Hume's attempt to get rid of the duration of "identical" natural objects as a fiction is one which he himself never really succeeds in keeping up. A pro- founder criticism would be that even when you have, as Butler might phrase it, "taken in" duration as well as succession, you have not yet got to "real time," in which the fundamental distinction is not that of a bare before and after, but that of present, past, and future. Bowman would, I imagine, agree with me that even the time of which such natural sciences as astronomy and geology treat is something much more than the t which figures as the " time- symbol" in the equations of the mathematical physicist, because it "takes in" duration as well as succession. And I certainly agree with him that what we call astronomical or geological time is not yet really time, because, though it has duration as well as successive- ness-a lesson we have all learned from Kant-there is no genuine I33</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY present in it. Its "present" is any moment arbitrarily selected, just as in analytical geometry any point may be the "origin of co- ordinates," and such "time," having no real present in it, has no real past or future either. And the relation between the present, the past, and the future is not merely that the present succeeds the past and is in turn displaced by the future, but that they interpenetrate: the past, our human "past," lives on in the present, as the present, when it has in turn become past, will live on in the future. Our past and future are not "unborn to-morrow and dead yesterday." Thus time in its full reality, what Bowman calls "spirit-time," belongs primarily to the "subjective" modality, and only gets a hold on the non-subjective in virtue of the existence of such "hetero- genous systems" as embodied selves. In view of its great importance for the philosophy of morals and religion, I regard the sections of the Metaphysical Prolegomena dealing with "spirit-time" as a con- tribution to metaphysics of the first magnitude. I would also com- mend to particular notice the longer examination, with special reference to the writings of Professor E. B. Holt, of the attempt to attribute spatiality to "states of mind." Bowman's reasoning in reply to Holt is minute and subtle, and not always easy to follow, but my own conviction is that, once comprehended, it is final and unanswerable. Never have I seen the complicated web of fallacies and false analogies by which this naturalistic obliteration of a fundamental difference between the physical and the subjective so carefully and triumphantly exposed. I turn now to the mention of some points where I personally find myself less able to follow the writer-of course, it may be my own fault-or could wish for more full exposition and discussion than he has given us. To begin with one or two relatively minor matters. It is clear, of course, that for a theory which-rightly, in my opinion -regards all consciousness as self-consciousness, the lower animals present a difficult problem; they must be "subjective systems," and therefore selves of some kind, but are they in any sense persons, and if not, just how does a person differ from a self? The question is not an easy one for any philosopher to answer; it is bound to be difficult just because, when all is said, we know so little about the animal's "experience." We have to imagine it for ourselves in anthropomorphic fashion, by starting with the only self with which we have direct acquaintance, the human self, and leaving out of the picture all that seems to be specially characteristic of homo sapiens, and this kind of abstraction is attended with all sorts of possibility of error. Probably, I believe, we shall have to conclude that, when all is done, the "animal mind" must always remain as much of a mystery to us as the "angelic intelligence." The "animals" of Kipling's Jungle Books are to me quite incredible; they are so I34</page><page sequence="10">BACK TO DESCARTES manifestly men disguised in animals' skins. But the animal as imagined, e.g. by T. H. Green, which has no genuine self at all, but is apparently only a succession of " subjective" states which are not the states of any "subject," is at least equally incredible. The truth must lie somewhere between these extremes, but it is very hard to see where the "right mean" can be, and Bowman does not, I think, afford us much help in the matter. From one note it would appear that he is so conscious of the difficulty that he would like, if only honesty to the facts would permit it, to follow the Cartesians in making the animals into mere automata, much as, I conceive, Green would have liked to do the same thing. He sees, of course, that this Cartesian view is quite incompatible with his own conception of the unity of a "subjective system," unless one is prepared to go to the length of Malebranche and the others who denied the reality of infra-human subjective states in toto, but he does not seem to have anything definite to put in its place. As I understand him, a lifeless "thing" has no genuine individuality at all; it is one thing or it is many things according as our particular interest requires us to treat it as one or as many: a human person has, independently of our interests, the individuality of a "subjective system" which can react against its own "vicissitudes" and largely determine the succession of its own states. But how far, and in what sense, an "animal" is one, independently of the convenience to us of treating it in some particular context as one, does not appear, and this leads one to note it as an important and unsolved problem for any philosophy which makes much, and rightly makes much, of the indefeasible unity and individuality of personality, to have a definite answer to the question, What precisely is an "animal"? or again, What precisely is a "vegetable"? The more one reflects on the question, the more difficult it seems to be to offer even a tentative answer, but I am at least sure that it is a question which must be very seriously asked and is not to be disposed of by any "cheap and easy" solution. Even behind this question there is a still more far-reaching one on which I do not feel that Bowman has said the last word. What, in the last resort, is the physical "modality of being" which we have to take as not "mind-dependent"? The answer given in our volume is that it is just a vast system of monotonous and purposeless undulations or vibrations of the kind sketched in the latest develop- ments of twentieth-century physics. Whatever is more than this, from the sensible qualities of bodies upwards to the highest "values" of science, art, ethics, religion, is "mind-dependent," and in the last resort owes its very existence to the mysterious presence in ourselves of the fusion of the physical and the subjective in a single "hetero- geneous" system. Nature is thus itself something much more than I35</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY "the physical," and it becomes strictly true that we are, so to say, fellow-workers with God in its construction: "Ours is her wedding- garment, ours her shroud." Qualities like colour, for example, have no physical reality, yet they definitely belong to nature. They are qualities neither of our minds nor of our nervous system, but of the things they are apprehended as qualifying. It is the rose, and not my optic nerve or my mind, which is crimson. Yet, as is assumed, the rose is only crimson because there is a person with a seeing eye to see it as crimson. Apparently the physical, before the appearance on the scene of beings with vision and hearing, had neither colour nor sonority, and, I presume, still has neither where there is no subject to see or to hear. Hence sensible qualities are actually counted as the lowest members of the ascending hierarchy of "values." Now I recognize, of course, that this view has a great deal to say for itself, and that it is something very different from the really ridicuous old-fashioned theory that colours, tones, fragrances, are "ideas in the perceiving mind." And yet, can we really believe it? Can we really believe that before the appearance of creatures with organs of colour-vision on the earth grass was not green, nor the skies blue, nor the clouds red at sunset, or that the flower which blooms in a lonely wilderness has no "sweetness" to waste on the desert air? And would not the arguments which are adduced to prove the "mind-dependence" of sensible qualities, if they are valid, equally prove the "mind-dependence" of the characters of nature which are studied by the physicist-in which case the "physical" becomes an "unknown X"? There seeems to me a certain failure in logic in the whole attempt to bring sensible qualities under the rubric of "values." Even if we consider only what figures in Bowman's arrangement as the next most rudimentary "value," that of sensible "charm," is it not obvious that whereas when I call a thing charming I know perfectly well that what I mean is that I am charmed by it, when I call it red or blue I do not mean that I am reddened or blued by it? Is it a sufficient rejoinder to say that, on the theory in question itself, colour, though "mind-dependent," is not like "charm," actually subjective? May it not be that what is "mind-dependent" is not the colour of the rose, but only the fact that its colour is apprehended? Further, Bowman's exposition leaves one in doubts and difficulties about the consistency of his account of values as "mind-dependent" with the theism to which he regards his metaphysics as necessarily leading. That the mind on which all the "values" are said to be dependent is embodied mind is clear from repeated assertions that the compresence of the subjective and the physical in one scheme of things, from which all value takes its rise, itself is only possible 136</page><page sequence="12">BACK TO DESCARTES in virtue of the mysterious and more intimate union of the sub- jective and the physical which constitutes an embodied self. But does this not mean that the whole range of value itself is only "all too human," and has no significance for God? And what sort of theism are we left with if we are to suppose God incapable of the apprehension of values? (It is true that there might be a way out if we could regard the universe as a body to which God is the soul, but that conception is rejected by the author himself.) Finally, what is, then, the relation between God and the monoto- nous meaningless scheme of undulations to which "the physical" has been reduced? We are expressly told that it is one of creation; the physical is created by God. Yet, as Mr. Scott has remarked in an editorial note, the few lines of the text which go beyond this bare statement suggest rather the neo-Platonic conception of a series of emanations, the "physical" arising somehow by a self- emptying of the divine subjectivity to the limit where being is on the verge of lapsing into nonentity. But is it really possible to unite the conceptions of creativity and of emanation? Is not genuine creation, in its very nature, conscious, intelligent, and freely willed, whereas "emanation" must be involuntary, unintelligent, and, in fact, unconscious? The history of Christian thought from Augustine to Descartes seems to me to be one of an emancipation from the neo-Platonic emanational metaphysics with which Christian philo- sophy inevitably began, and the emancipation, so far as I can see, was due to a justified conviction that there is a real antithesis between the neo-Platonic and the Christian conceptions of the relation of the world to God. I cannot help thinking that if Bowman had lived to work out the theism for which his volume provides prolegomena, he would have been forced himself to make his option between a doctrine of emanation and one of creation in the full Christian sense of the word, and I have no doubt for which alter- native such an anima naturaliter christiana would have decided.
