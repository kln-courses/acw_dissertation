<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORIES OF CREATION IN THE RIG VEDA WY. NORMAN BROWN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE BEGINNINGS OF SPECULATIVE THOUGHT in India, as in Greece, lie in notions of cosmogony. How did everything begin? The earliest recorded Indian notions are preserved in well known hymns of the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda, which have been studied by many scholars. The present paper is an attempt to deal with those cosmogonic ideas, especially those appearing in the Rig Veda, in an ordered and, as far as possible, related se- quence; if successful, this should add to our under- standing of Indian philosophic origins. The ideas of creation which are to be mentioned here have their bases in various intellectual atti- tudes or assumptions, namely, myth, theology, ritual, magic, evolution of a self-contained im- personal entity, and the existence of an all-envelop- ing mechanism or shell. The theories derived from these various bases are not mutually reconciled in the Rig Veda, nor is there any intimation, for the most part, that they are considered or even sus- pected to be incompatible. The most conspicuous theories are those ex- pressed in myth, and of these there are several. The oldest, and at the same time the least promi- nent and shortest-lived in Indo-Aryan speculation, is an Indo-European myth, guaranteed as such by the wider general Indo-European character of the proper names and the ideas which are employed. This is the myth that Father Sky (dyaus pitr) and Mother Earth (prthvi matr) have as their children the gods (deva), namely Dawn (usas) and the two heavenly Horseman (asvinau, divo napam t). With this bit of mythology about Sky and Earth come to be associated other bits of mythology. One concerns Tvastr, the artificer of the gods, who is called the one born at the beginning (agriya) or the first-going (puroyavan). At the beginning he was the counterpart of the cosmic waters (AV 9. 4. 2) or, as is stated elsewhere, combined in him- self both male and female qualities (AV 9. 4. 3-6). He it was who created Sky and Earth and all creatures (RRV 3.55.19; 10.110.9; 1.160.4), though how he did so and out of what material is not made clear. The myth of Tvastr is not Indo- European in origin but seems to have been acquired by the Aryans after leaving their Indo-European homeland. Another bit of mythology concerns the twins Yama and Yam! (RV 10. 10),1 who are the progenitors of the human race. This myth is at least Indo-Iranian, possibly Indo-European. None of these myths, whether separately or in combination, is the prevailing creation myth of the Rig Veda. That place belongs to the myth of the god Indra and the demon Vrtra. This I have discussed elsewhere 2 and I shall only summarize it here. The Indra myth opens with the state of precrea- tion. The material constituents of the universe seem already to have been in existence then, but there was no warmth in the universe, no moisture, nor any organization of the material elements, that is, no order or system. There was only chaos, with- out the principles of cosmic truth or order or ordered movement (eta) to regulate all. There existed, however, powerful beings with life who were called Asura,3 apparently living in a house consisting of Sky and Earth, which at that time were not separated but were joined together. Pre- sumably Sky and Earth had been fashioned by Tvastr. The Asuras were of two kinds, the Adityas, led by Varuna, and the Danavas or the Ddnava, led by Vrtra, who in some passages ap- pears alone, while in others he seems to have allies or supporters. The Adityas and the Ddnavas were in a state of mortal enmity, engaged in a struggle with each other; we might call it war. The Asuras have mothers but no fathers, because the mothers are personifications of feminine abstractions.4 The Adityas are the sons of Aditi (aditeh putrih), whose name means " non-restraint'" (a-diti, de- rived with the suffix -ti from the root da "bind") or " expansion, release, progressivism, development, 1 The most recent discussion I have seen of this well known myth is in a paper by Stella Kramrisch, " Two: Its Significance in the R.gveda," in Indological Studies in [Ionor of TV.

The Ddnavas are the de- scendants of Ddnu, whose name is another abstract primary derivative from the root Xct "bind," this time with the suffix -nu, and means "bondage, re- straint, conservatism, inertia," and the name of their leader Vrtra means " covering, lid," from the root vr. The war between the Adityas and the Danavas had come to a standstill or possibly we should understand that the Adityas were being worsted. They arranged, however, for a champion to be born, namely Indra, whose parents appear to be Sky and Earth,5 the parents of the devas, as distinguished from the Asuras.6 The name of Indra has no obvious or generally accepted ety- mology, but the god is often designated by terms which indicate that he too is a personification of an abstraction, namely power; thus he is called "son of might" (sahcasah putrah) or "lord of power" (sacipatih). Before agreeing to be the champion of the Adityas, he was foresighted enough, though only just born, to extract a promise from them that he should be their king. The battle between Indra and Vrtra now takes place. Armed with a weapon (vajra) forged by Tvastr and fortified with three great draughts of soma, Indra attacked Vrtra and after a fierce fight slew him, and, as the texts sometimes put it, burst his belly. Thereupon out flowed the cosmic waters (&amp;pah), called the seven streams (sapta sindha- vah). It was they whom Vrtra and the Ddnavas had been restraining and whose release the Adityas had been seeking. When the Waters were released and came flowing out with sounds of satisfaction like the lowing of cattle, and made their way to the ocean in the sky, they were found to be jointly pregnant, and their embryo was the Sun. The universe now had the moisture, heat, and light it needed and creation could take place. The earth was spread out, the sky was supported above it; in short, as it is put in one passage (RV 6. 24. 5), Indra separated the Sat from the Asat. The Sat is the sky, the earth, and the intervening atmos- phere, the regions where gods and men live and move. The Asat is a place of horror, darkness, and drought below the earth, reached by a fearful chasm, where the demons (raksas) dwell and breed.7 In the Sat the body of truth, cosmic law (rta), was established and put under the direction of Varuna; in the Asat there is no such truth and law, for it is without truth and law (anrta). This myth was doubtless viewed in two ways in Vedic times, depending upon the degree of intel- lectual sophistication of the viewers. To some it was an account to be taken at its face value, which was essentially theological. A great divine hero, an anthropomorphic demiurge, slew a fierce wicked theriomorphic demon in the form of a dragon. Thus he won the Waters and the Sun. He sepa- rated the Sat from the Asat, spread out the earth, propped up the sky, and organized and assigned duties to the gods. But to the more sophisticated the myth was a symbolic representation of Potentiality striving with Inertia, and overcoming Inertia through the aid of the Power or Energy existing in the uni- verse, especially in the atmosphere, where the mighty winds blow, the thunder rolls, and the lightning strikes. Truth has by nature its home in a free and lighted world, while Evil comes from darkness and bondage, and the two are engaged in a never-ceasing opposition in our universe. Con- stant alertness and strenuous unrelaxed effort is the price of freedom and justice, which can best be aided by cooperation between gods and men in the sacrifice. This understanding of the Indra-Vrtra myth as an allegory, verified for us by the etymo- logical significance of the terms Asura, Aditya, Danava, and some of the epithets applied to Indra such as Son of Might and others, may be regarded as the first recorded philosophic speculation in India. But at the same time the origin of the material substance of the universe is not a subject of inquiry or is ascribed in some unspecified way to Tvastr; rather the elements of the problem posed are how the Sat came to be differentiated from the Asat; which of the two existed first; whence came the water, the light, and the warmth by which the Sat lives; and finally how it was all given the organization by which it operates. Following the Indra-Vrtra myth come the other, later, cosmogonic theories of the Rig Veda (in Books I and X) and the Atharva Veda. Some of these deal with or proceed from or deny theological or theistic items appearing in the myth, rectifying features of it which later theologues seem to have considered naive or untenable. They may even echo phraseology used in the myth.8 Other theories seem related to the allegorical understanding of 5 JAOS 62. 92 f. 8 JAOS 62. 88. 7 Cf.

Both kinds of speculation indicate dis- satisfaction with the Indra-Vrtra myth, whether it is taken literally or symbolically. Sometimes both views appear in the same hymn. Let us look first at the hymns which emphasize the theistic approach. Here an attack is made directly upon Indra. We may suppose that skepti- cism about him was not infrequent, skepticism such as is indicated in RV 8. 100. 3, "Bring lovely praise to Indra, vying with one another, truthful praise, if he himself be true -even though one or the other says, 'Indra is not! Who ever saw him? Who is he that we should praise him.? "' The adjectives anindra and as'raddha, employed to mean those who deny Indra or lack faith in him, also testify to the existence of such doubt. The most obvious illustration is RV 10. 121, a riddle-type (brahmodya) hymn to the god Ka (Who), not otherwise named until the final stanza of the hymn, where the answer to the riddle is given and the god is called Prajdpati (" Lord of Creatures "). To the god are ascribed powers and feats which regu- larly are Indra's: the making firm of earth and sky, the rulership over the gods, the giving of victory to one of two rival armies, the release of the waters, the instituting of the sacrifice, the status of sole god (eka deva). If we accept the authenticity of the final stanza, in which Prajdpati is named as the supreme god, the hymn is a direct refutation of Indra's position and an assertion of a super-deity in his place and of course above him. If, on the other hand, we should accept the other view of the final stanza, namely, that it is spurious, and therefore consider that the hymn remains a riddle with no answer definitely and clearly given but with the unexpressed answer being that Indra is the supreme god, then the false and later addi- tion of the final stanza still would be positive evidence that in someone's view (not the author of the hymn) Indra was to be supplanted by another deity. In the one case the two hymns RV 10. 121 and RV 2.12 (the sa janisa indra hymn), which latter is an unambiguous passionate asser- tion of Indra's preeminence, would be in harmony and would convey an identical rebuke of infidelity. By the other interpretation the two hymns would be vigorously polemical with each other. In either case we find proof that there was disbelief in Indra's supremacy and instead advocacy of some other, superior, deity, whether Prajdpati or another. Another theistic figure is Visvakarman, who is celebrated in two hymns (RV 10. 81; 10. 82). His name meaning "All-maker" (Artifex Maximus) is elsewhere an epithet of Indra (RV 8. 98. 2), and possibly of the Sun (RV 10. 170), but he is not credited in his two hymns with many of Indra's specific deeds and qualities. Rather, he is con- ceived in loftier, more monotheistic terms. As our father he celebrated or instructed the sages (Tris) how to celebrate the first sacrifice, which was that of creation (and where, by the way, did these rsis come from -there is no answer in the text). Thus he created heaven and earth, though where he stood when doing so and what the material was which he used is a question posed for answer. He is supreme, and where he is, there the pious dead enjoy the fruit of their sacrifices. He seems to have created the gods, for he gave them their names (RV 10.82.3). Where all the gods were assembled the waters set down the primeval germ (garbhar prathamamn), which was beyond (that is, above) heaven and earth, beyond the asuras and the devas, and this germ the gods sacrificed in the sacrificial fire (ajasya nabhacu). The primeval germ contained all the material of the universe (like the purusa in RV 10. 90), and this is the answer to part of the question asked above; but the material was all inanimate and had to be organized by the gods in the sacrifice which Visvakarman taught them. This hymn further brings up the epistemological question, asserting that all crea- tures go to Visvakarman to question him, that is, he is the ultimate source of knowledge. Nowadays, says the final stanza of RV 10. 82, priests do not know who created all things; something other than such knowledge exists within them; covered with mist and muttering and addicted to creature com- forts (asutrp), do the chanters of hymns spend their time. This latter notion is similar to the contempt expressed in RV 10. 71 for priests who mechanically perform the ceremony but have no true insight. For knowledge let men of mystic insight inquire with their own minds (RV 10. 81. 4). The epistemological question recurs in other speculative hymns (RV 10. 72. 1 and 10. 129. 4), where again the answer is that sages per- ceive the truth by looking in their own hearts, that is, by introspection. The figure and name of Visvakarman do not endure, as do those of Prajdpati, but the ideas contained in the two</page><page sequence="4">26 BROWN: Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda hymns to him are frequently echoed in other speculative hymns of the Rig Veda. A less direct displacement of Indra takes place through Brahmanaspati or Brhaspati. The first name means " Lord of the Brahman," which is the mystic power that pervades the universe. The other name, Brhaspati, means "Lord of the Brh," which is the prayer by means of which that power is evoked. This deity is an innovation of the priests, and he is credited with some of Indra's feats. He and Indra are represented as cooperat- ing to perform some of the greatest of these: winning the light for the universe, spreading out the earth, and others. The hieratic point of view leading to the creation of Brahmanaspati seems to be that the great deeds which Indra was said to have performed could not have been performed through mere physical might but were really made possible through the mystic power in the universe which was put into application through the sacri- fice. Hence Indra and Brahmanaspati are viewed as operating jointly (RV 2. 24). The next step was to ascribe the action to Brahmanaspati alone with Indra ignored (RV 10. 68). Then comes the ascription of all to Brahmanaspati, and in terms that transcend the Indra-Vrtra range of achieve- ment. Brahmanaspati is depicted as Creator in RV 10. 72. Here also the question is at last raised concerning the origin not only of sentient beings, gods and men, but also of the insentient material of which the universe is constructed. The material part, we are told, was made by Brahmanaspati, lord of prayer, high priest of the sacrifice, as though blown up by a smith at his forge. First came the Asat (uncreated and unordered chaos), as in the Indra-Vrtra myth. The Asat in 10. 72 is also called Uttdnapad (she with legs outspread as in parturition). From the Asat was born the Sat, the ordered universe of Earth, Atmosphere, and Sky. The hymn also says Tat or Bha (Earth) was born from Uttdnapad. From the Sat were born the Directions (&amp;ash). Parallel to the origin of the material substance of the world was the origin of animate beings. These came from Daksa (male potentiality) and Aditi (female creative power). Each of this pair was produced from the other, which seems to be a way of saying that the two are interdependent. Where Daksa and Aditi came from is not made clear. Possibly we are to under- stand that Brahman.iaspati created them, or possibly they were self-existent forces which acted upon, or in concert with, each other. From Aditi were born the gods, who fashioned the worlds out of the in- sentient material. The gods labored in unison with joined hands in the primordial chaos (salila), where they found the sun which had been concealed in the ocean. These gods, the hymn says, were the Adityas and they were seven. They had a brother, Aditi's eighth son, called Mdrtdnd.a, the one sprung from the egg of mortals. He was subject to birth followed by death; as the hymn puts it Aditi bore him "to be born and then to die again." It was A2artdnda who was concealed in the ocean as the Sun and was found there by the gods (cf. the epic story of the churning of the ocean by the devas and the Asuras, to produce the sun, moon, and many other things). MArtdnda thus brought death into the universe. At the beginning of this hymn the epistemological question was raised, as we have seen above. The answer to it is that sages can gain knowledge by introspection. Another im- portant point in this hymn is that Brahmanaspati, as master of the sacrifice, is the ultimate origin of all. From him, we must surely understand, came the knowledge of the sacrifice by which the gods put order into the universe and produced the sun. The hymn RV 10. 72 lays emphasis on the sacri- fice, which has already appeared less conspicuously in the Indra myth, where the slaying of Vrtra is sometimes spoken of as a sacrifice, and in the Visvakarman hymns. In one of these latter (RV 10. 81) Visvakarman's activity is almost entirely expressed in terms of the sacrifice, and Visvakar- man is besought to teach its ritual to his friends. that is, to the priests addressing him. Another hymn, the Purusa-sfikta (RV 10. 90),9 puts even greater emphasis upon the ritual used by the gods in effecting creation by sacrificing Purusa and speaks only briefly (stanza 5) about the origin of Purusa. Purusa, Male, appears to be a collective term for all the material elements of the universe (cf. 10. 81 above), designated here, perhaps meta- phorically, as a sacrificial offering. Purusa, says the hymn, is the cosmos with all its contents and is more besides. It includes not only the inani- mate world, but also all mortal creatures. Even VirirAj was born of Purusa, though Piurusa is also "This hymn has recently received a long, thoughtful, and most illuminating study by Professor Paul Mus, " Du nouveau sur Rgveda 10. 90?

Only the gods seem to be external to Purusa, but where they came from is not indicated in the hymn. Two-thirds of the hymn is given to an account of the sacrifice and an enumeration of all its constituents (including the Brdhmana as Purusa's mouth, the Rajanya as the arms, the Vaisya as the thighs) and an enu- meration of all that was produced from it, men- tioning not only the kudras and the animals; earth, sky, and atmosphere; the moon and the sun; but also the hymns, the chants, the metres, and the prose formulae, and even the gods Indra, Agni, and VYyu. Who the gods were who performed the sacrifice (stanza 6) we cannot say with certainty for they are not named in the hymn. The point of view of the hymn is hieratic and ritualistic; the hymn is an exaltation of the sacrifice, which is more important and powerful than the beings who celebrated it. This is the notion which later domi- nates the Brthmanas. In this hymn, more ex- plicitly than in any other of the cosmogonic hymns, creation is a product of the ritual. The close relation between ritual and magic leads to what is essentially an ascription of creative action to the power of words or sound. That is, the potency of words is considered to be the effec- tive creative force. When the gods utter the names of things, at the time of the first sacrifice, these things come into existence (RV 10. 71. 1; 10. 82. 3). In the self-praise hymn to Vac (RV 10. 125), who is a deification of the sounds of the sacrifice, she claims control of the universe for herself, and tells us her birthplace was in the waters, the ocean (stanza 7), as is elsewhere that of hiranyagarbha (RV 10. 121. 1), whence she spread out on all sides over the world and reached the sky. She says she surpasses all the universe (stanza 8), using words that recall the description of Purusa (RV 10. 90. 3). We may possibly be justified in thinking that Vac is conceived as being the creative force of the universe, though there is no explicit state- ment to that effect. If this is meant, then we have the apotheosis of the spell, the final exaltation of the magic sound. Up to this point none of the hymns discussed has contained any explicit statement or even hint that our universe, both the psychical and the mate- rial, has its origin in some single principle or is an evolution from some primeval germ or is the ex- pression of the will of some absolute deity as an emanation of himself. Nothing monistic has ap- peared. Rather, each hymn merely tries to identify a more remote active agent than any assumed in other theories. Also the hymns either explicitly say or else imply that before creation the universe contained two kinds of constituents, or principles. One was animate, psychical, and having the power of will; it consisted of the gods or an overgod. The other was inanimate, material, insentient, non- psychical, without the power of will, being the object upon which the first acts as subject. Thus creation took place. In the hymn RV 10. 129, however, both the will of a deity and the power of the sacrifice are ignored, tacitly rejected, and in- stead there appears the idea of a single principle from which our entire universe is evolved. The idea is perhaps implied, though not explicitly stated, in the well known stanza RV 1. 164. 46, "They call it Indra, Mitra, Varuna, and Agni, or the heavenly bird Garutmant. The sages speak of the One Existent in many ways; they call it Agni, Yama, Mdtarisvan." The Vedic term for the One Existent is ekam sat, which is neuter. In RV 10. 129, the idea of a single neuter principle from which all evolves is explicitly expressed under the term tad ekam, That One. This existed before the Sat and the Asat, when there was only dark- ness, an unillumined flood, chaos. That One came to life spontaneously, though uninspired by breath, through its own potentiality. It was born out of its shell through the power of its own inner creative incubating heat, not needing any warmth from outside. Once born and animate, it experienced desire, says the hymn, and this desire became the first seed of mind. Our knowledge that this was the origin of things, the manner of creation, the nature of the cosmogonic process, has not come by a line of transmission starting from the beginning. Nor lhas it come to man by a communication from the gods, who are all this side of creation, that is, they were themselves created and are ignorant of origins. Possibly, the hymn says, the highest over- seer of our universe, who resides in heaven, knows the facts about creation, but perhaps -meaning more likely -he does not. Rather, knowledge of the beginnings was acquired by the sages who dis- covered it by pious insight into their own hearts, that is, by introspection. Knowledge, we see, is won through this mystical means, and epistemology is frankly an expression of mysticism. Here then is our first clear presentation of the monistic idea, which is later elaborated in the</page><page sequence="6">28 BROWN: Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda Upanishads. So far has the evolution of thought brought us from the Indra-Vrtra myth! There is still something lacking, which is the conception of the soul, or self, the atman. This has not been mentioned in the hymns, though possibly hinted at in 10. 129, while later in the monistic Upani- shads it is to be identified with brahman. Brahman is indeed mentioned in the Rig Veda as the power pervading the universe, to be reached or utilized by means of the sacrifice or by true, that is mystical suprasensual, perception (cf. RV 10. 71. 6), the sages' pious insight of RV 10. 129. By the time of the Upanishads the idea of brahman had attained a new quality, including the properties it had in the Rig Veda but with the added feature of being the one reality, the Absolute. But this is merely to say that Hindu speculative thought had only passed through its early stages by the end of the Rig Veda, a point about which there can be little argument. The effort to find some single unifying principle of the universe also appears in the idea of Time and the idea of Skambha (the Frame) in the Atharva Veda. Time (kala) is celebrated as the primordial power in AV 19. 53 and 19. 54.10 In it lie the worlds and the sun. By it was the uni- verse urged forth. It is brahman. In it are the waters; from it arose brahman, the hymns, the prose formulae. Time contains and conquers all, and still continues onward. The idea of a framework (skambha) containing within it all that is in the universe is the subject of the two long hymns to Skambha (AV 10. 7 and 10. 8), a notion somewhat analogous to the purusa idea of RV 10. 90, but even more inclusive, for nothing is considered to exist outside it. Neither the idea of all-containing Time nor that of an all-enveloping Frame stood up in later competition with the Sole Existent (tad ekam) concept of RV 10. 129. The notion of Time as all-container, which may have been considered by its authors to answer the antinomy of temporal infinity, did not deal with the antinomies of space and of cause and effect. So, too, the idea of an all-enveloping Frame, which may have been meant to answer the antinomy of spatial infinity, did not deal with the antinomies of the infinity of time and of cause and effect. The Sole Existent con- cept, however, seems to have been regarded as coping not only with the antinomy of the infinity of cause and effect but also with the two other antinomies as well, viewing them all from the view- point of a realistic monism. Thus, the personal anthropomorphic demiurge of the Indra-Vrtra myth was replaced in various ways by a definitely specified supreme deity operat- ing with a dualistic universe, that is, on the basis of a superdeity (adhidaiva) approach to the prob- lem of cosmogony. This was succeeded, ideologi- cally speaking, by a view of the sacrifice as supreme, again in a dualistic universe. This might be designated a supersacrifice (adhiyajiha) concept. Finally, so far as the Rig and Atharva Vedas carry us, there developed the notion of a monistic (advaita) basis for the universe, impersonal in character, neuter, mechanistic in operation, which might also have had an oversoul (adhyatma) com- ponent. At this point speculation in the Rig and Atharva Vedas reached its culmination. It re- mained for the Upanishads to proceed further. APPENDIX * RV 2. 12.

You, who rend out booty for the soma- presser, the soma-brewer, 0 terrible one, you are of course true (to your function) in being so. May we, 0 Indra, ever being your friends, possessed of many hero sons, address the sacrificial session. RV 10. 72. The problem is the origin of the gods [and of the universe]. The method of solution is by mystic revelation in trance or by introspection. 1. Let us now with skill proclaim the origins of the gods so that in a later age someone may see them (origins) when the hymns are being chanted. Mystic revelation or introspection also gives the exceptional priest special power in 10. 71 (which seems to have affinities of authorship with 10. 72). 2. These (creations, worlds) Brahmanaspati fanned up like a smith. In the first age of the gods the Sat was generated from the Asat. Variantly, eta might be dual masc. referring to the two worlds (10. 81.3 sam bdhzubhyJtn dhadmati sadm patatrair dyavabhiimi janatyan deva 6kah) or neut. pl. referring to jana in stanza 1. 3. In the first age of the gods, the Sat was born from the Asat. From that (Sat) were produced the directions. That (Sat) [was produced] from UTttdnapad. uttdndpad (fem.) is one whose legs are stretched apart in parturition and refers to the Asat as the source from which all parts of the cosmos came. 4. The earth was born from Uttdnapad; the directions were born from the earth. Daksa (male potentiality) was born from Aditi (female active power), and Aditi from Daksa (that is, the two are interdependent). 5. For Aditi was born, 0 Daksa, she who is your daughter. After (= from) her were born the</page><page sequence="8">30 BROWN: Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda gods, the blessed (fortunate) ones, linked to im- mortality. 6. When, 0 gods, you took your places there [in a ring] in the salila (tumultuous chaos) with your hands firmly linked, a thick dust spread out as from dancers. Cf. of Visnu in 1. 22. 17, where all this world [idaim] is held in the dust of his footstep. 7. When, 0 gods, like zealous priests, you caused the worlds to develop, you produced from there the sun which was concealed in the ocean. 8. Eight sons had been born from Aditi's body. With seven she went to the gods. [The eighth] Ailrtanda she cast aside. 9. With seven sons Aditi went [where?] in the earliest age. But she bore Mdrtdnda to be born and then to die again. (Thus death was brought to the world, causing the existence of mortals.) Daksa is male potentiality, Aditi is female active power. The two are coordinate, of equal impor- tance, interdependent. From Aditi, impregnated by Daksa, are born seven gods, who effect creation from the chaos of unorganized material, especially by causing the Sun to emerge. The Sun is their brother, whom Aditi had cast away. When the gods churned the salila they caused the Sun to appear, but the Sun goes through a continuous process of birth and death again. The Sun's name here is Martinda which means "born of a lifeless egg" (rnrtynda). From it are descended mortals. The material part of the cosmos was blown up by Brahmanaspati " Lord of the mystical essence of the universe." The material part of the cosmos is given ordered form by the gods. Creative Power Material of the Cosmos (created by Brahmanaspati) Aditi/Dakea Vs. 2 Vs. 3 Vs. 3 Vs. 4 | Asat = Asat = Uttanapad = Uttanapad Aditi l l l l | Sat = Sat = Tat (Sat) = Bhfi Devah Martanda Agah = Agah = Asah Mdrtdnda was mortal. His mother Aditi cast him away. His immortal brothers the Devah, look- ing for him, agitated (or churned) the unorganized chaos (salila) and found him. He is the Sun. The hymn does not continue an account of the process of creation beyond this point, but the implication is that, after causing the Sun to emerge, the Devdh continued the rest of creation. For Aditi and Daksa, Sat and Asat, cf. 10. 5. 7 (note also BAU 1. 4.3). The notion implicit in eta in stanza 2, if the word is dual, might be that Brahmanaspati, as first cause, created both the material cause of the universe (Sat and Asat) and the efficient cause (Aditi/Daksa). RV 10. 81. To Visvakarman as creator. The name is used of " the All-fashioner " in RV 10. 81 and 10.82; of the Sun (?) in 10. 170; of Indra in 7. 98. 2. It means artifex, as the name Prajd- pati means genitor. 1. He, our father, who as rsi, as invoking priest, sat down to offer in sacrifice all creations [then in their unorganized state], he, seeking wealth through his wish, concealing all the primordial form, has entered into their later (or evolved) forms. This stanza poses the problem: what was the beginning of things? The stanza says that Our Father did it all at the beginning by sacrifice. But he has covered over all the original form, has entered into the later evolved forms. 2. What now was his standing place (7roi -TG) ? What was his support? How was it? That from which Visvakarman created the earth, and, looking far away, uncovered the sky by his power? 3. Eyes he had on all sides, mouths on all sides, arms on all sides, feet on all sides, when by using his two arms like fans he blew up heaven and earth (as a smith would) as he, the sole god, created them. For this stanza cf. 10. 90. 1. sam bdhuibhyjm dhamati . . . Cf. 10. 72. 1.

Let other folk (priests) round about be deceived (about the right way to sacri- fice) ! Here let us have a generous patron! 7. Let us today [successfully] invoke for our aid in the [sacrificial] contest the lord of [sacrificial] utterance, Visvakarman, who is as swift as thought. May he rejoice in all our offerings for our aid, he who gives all prosperity, he whose works are righteous. vdcas patim = master of utterance, husband of Vac. RV 10. 82. To Visvakarman as creator. 1. The father of the eye (creator of the Sun), wise (in sacrificial performance), created these two (Heaven and Earth) [as though by churning] butter, all crumpled together. When their ends were firmly fastened together in the east, he spread out Sky and Earth. yaded dnta addadrhanta p'rve, cf. AV 5. 6. 1. 2. Visvakarman is the all-wise, the all-mighty, the Creator, the Disposer, and indeed the loftiest Manifestation. Their (the pious dead's) offerings with the drink they have proffered (to the gods) rejoice them where they say he dwells as the One, beyond the seven rsis. Allusion to the realm where the pious dead rejoicce with Yama, cf RV 10. 14-18, and 1. 154.5. 3. He who as our Father, our Progenitor, the Disposer, knows the foundations and all the worlds (or, all creations), who alone is the sole name- giver of the gods - to him go all the other crea- tures to question him [about origins]. 4. They sacrificed wealth to him-the r.sis of old in great number, like singers, they who when the illumined atmosphere (rajas) was still im- mersed in the unillumined (Asat?) set themselves down and made these things that have been created. 5. That which is beyond the heaven, beyond this earth, beyond the gods and the asuras-what pri- meval germ indeed did the waters set down where all the gods perceived it? Cf. 10. 129. 1, etc. garbham prathamam, cf. 10. 121. 7; 10. 129. 2-3. 6. The waters set down that first embryo where all the gods were assembled. In the navel of the unborn (Agni) was proffered the One, in which were all creatures. ajasya nabhau, cf. 1. 164.14. 7. You do not know him who created these things. Another thing [than true knowledge] has come to exist within you. Covered with mist and muttering, addicted to creature comforts (asutrp), the chanters of hymns spend their time. For the theme of incapable and unperceptive priests, see RV 10. 71. The subject matter of the separate stanzas is as follows: (1) Visvakarman created Heaven and Earth and spread them out. (2) He is supreme; where he is the pious dead enjoy the fruit of their sacrifices. (3) All creatures have to go to him to learn ultimate truth. (4) In the beginning, the rsis performed the sacrifice to produce creations. (5) What was the original germ of the cosmos? (6) The waters set it down before the gods, The One in which were all creations. (7) The hymn- chanters of our time, an unworthy lot, do not know this. RV 10. 90. (On this hymn see Professor Paul Mus, op. cit.) 1. Purusa has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. Having covered the earth on all sides, he extended beyond it by ten fingers' length. si bh Imim v "vato vrtv'; cf. RV 10. 81. 1, 10. 129. 1; AV 10. 2. 18. 2. Purusa alone is this entire world, both past and future; he is also the lord of immortality when he mounts above (to heaven) through (sacrificial) food. 3. As great as is his greatness (as described in stanza 2), yet greater than that is Purusa. One- fourth of him is all creatures; three-fourths of him are immortality in heaven. VYc, like Purusa, has four parts, three being concealed, the fourth being known to humans (RV 1. 164. 45). Brahmans with real insight know this (cf. RV 10. 72. 1 and 10. 129. 4; cf. 10. 82. 7). 4. With three-fourths Purusa rose upwards; one-fourth of him was reborn here. Thence he strode across in all directions above earth and heaven (or, by day and night?). sasandnas'ane` "the eater and the noneater"</page><page sequence="10">32 BROWN: Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda cf. 1. 164. 20). This might refer to Agni and Sfirya, Agni being " the eater " par excel- lence and Sfirya "the observer." 5. From him was born Virdj, and from VirAj was born Purusa. When born he overpassed the earth both in the west and in the east. For children begetting their parents or for two primordial entities begetting each other, cf. Indra and his parents (RV 10. 54. 3), earth and sky and their sons (RV 1.159. 2, 3), Daksa and Aditi (RV 10. 72.4, 5), Agni and his mothers (RV 1. 95. 4, cf. 6. 16. 35). 6. When the gods performed the sacrifice with Purusa as oblation, the spring was its melted butter, the summer its fuel, the autumn its oblation. " Oblation " in its first usage here is a set and solemn act, the type of oblation, not "any old " oblation, but at the end of the stanza the word is denuded of its pointedness and means only an ordinary oblation. 7. Him, Purusa, born at the beginning, they besprinkled on the straw; the gods (Adityas?) sacrificed with him, and the Sddhyas and the Rsis. sddhyd r'sayas ca ye might mean " full of power and being Tsis." 8. From that sacrifice, when it was fully offered, the speckled (clotted) butter was collected; it con- stituted the birds and the wild and domestic animals. 9. From that sacrifice, when it was fully offered, the hymns were born, and the chants; the metres were born from it, and from it the prose formula was born. 10. From that were born horses and whatever (other) animals have (incisor) teeth in both (upper and lower) jaws. Cows were born from it; from it were born goats and sheep. The reference is to the sacrificial animals (see JAOS 51. 117). 11. When they divided Purusa, into how many parts did they separate him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were the thighs and feet called? 12. The Brahmana was his mouth; the Rdjanya was made into his arms; as for his thighs, that was what the Vaisya became; from his feet the kidra was born. 13. The moon was born from his mind; from his eye was born the sun; from his mouth Indra and Agni; from his breath Vdyu was born. 14. From his navel the atmosphere, from his head the sky was evolved, from his feet the earth, the directions from his ear. Thus they fashioned the regions. 15. Seven were the enclosing-sticks of it; thrice seven were the sticks of firewood, when the gods conducting the sacrifice bound Purusa as the ani- mal (victim). 16. With the sacrifice the gods produced the sacrifice; these were the first ordinances. These powers (arising from the sacrifice) reach the sky, where are the Sadhyas and the gods. RV 10. 121. To Ka, Prajdpati. The background is disbelief in Indra as Creator and Sole God; as the hymn stands, and assuming that the final stanza is original, it could be a polemic against RV 2. 12, with the purpose of establishing Prajdpati as the Sole God, i. e., it is monotheistic. In form it is a Brahmodya with the answer in st. 10. AV 4. 2 is a version of this hymn. 1. Hiranyagarbha came into existence in the beginning born as the sole lord of all that has come into existence. He made firm (fixed) the earth and sky as well-to what god shall we give worship with oblation ? hiranyagarbha: cf. 10. 129.3 (though in 10. 121. 1 without specific mention or implica- tion of egg). sam avartata: cf. 10. 129. 2, 4, 6; 10. 121. 7. p'tir e1cah is in contrast to Indra as dev6 6lkah. Later the neuter tad ekam is in contrast to both, as is also ekcam sat (1. 164. 46). Cf. also in stanza 2 (eka id raja jaigato babhi'va) of this hymn. 2. He who gives breath and strength, whose command all the gods observe, whose shadow is immortality and death -to what god etc.? yasya chjyamftam yasya mrtyt'h; cf. 10. 129. 2. 3. He who by his greatness has become the sole ruler of this breathing, winking world, who is the ruler of this world consisting of bipeds and quadru- peds -to what god, etc.? 4. He who, by his power, they say, has these snowy mountains, whose is the ocean with Rasa, whose are the directions as his arms - to what god, etc. ? yasyemdh pradigo yasya bdh; cf. 6. 47. 8.</page><page sequence="11">BROWN: Theories of Creation in the Rig Veda 33 5. He by whom the sky was made strong and the earth made firm, by whom the heaven and the celestial vault were set in place, who measured out the regions in the atmosphere-to what god, etc. ? 6. He whom the two roaring [armies], who have sought support with his help, look upon trembling in mind when the risen sun is shining -to what god, etc.? krandasi: cf. 6. 25. 4; 2. 12. 8. The two roar- ing (armies?) could conceivably be the armies of the Adityas and the Ddnavas or they might be any pair of armies in array against each other. Or the two Roarers might be Heaven and Earth, since the verb krand is used of Dyaus and Parjanya, and in that case the dual would mean the Sky and the Other One (= Earth). The mythic allusion could then be to Indra's forceful separation of Heaven and Earth after he had drunk the soma before going to battle with Vrtra. But this stanza seems to be a contradiction of 2. 12. 8, where a translation of krdndasi as " Heaven and Earth " seems impossible. 7. When the mighty waters came bearing the embryo (Sun) and giving birth to Agni, then the life spirit of the gods came into existence - to what god, etc.? 8. He who in his might looked upon the waters which bore ritual skill (daksa) and created the sacrifice, he who was the sole god over the gods- to what god, etc.? 9. May not he harm us, he who is the progenitor of the earth, he who with truth as his function created heaven and caused the bright and mighty waters to be born - to what god, etc. ? 10. Prajapati, other than you no one has en- compassed all these creations. Whatever we desire when we invoke you, let that be ours! May we be lords of wealth! RV 10. 125.

Both Varuna and Mlitra do I support, Indra and Agni, and the Asvins. 2. I uphold the swelling Soma, Tvastr, Pusan, and Bhaga. I bestow wealth on the zealous patron of the sacrifice, who makes the oblation and presses the soma. 3. I am the queen, the confluence of wealth, the one with penetrating perception, the first of those who should be worshipped.

Only I myself say this in which gods and men rejoice. Whomever I give my favor to, him I make powerful, a true knower of the mystical power, a rsi, a successful sacrificer. 6.

" by its own potentiality "; cf. RV 10. 72. 1. 3. There was darkness hidden by darkness at the beginning. This all was an unillumined flood. The force (with power of evolution) which was enclosed in emptiness (a shell), That One, was born through the power of its own (creative incu- bating) heat. cf. RV 10. 190. 1. tuchyena . . . apihitam. Possibly there is implied here the idea of a universe contained in an egg-shaped container or shell (cf. ChU 3. 19, Maitri U 6. 36, and the later expression brahminda). The developing power (dbhu) is to put in it the sat and the asat, and in the sat will put the r"jas and the vy6man (st. 1). 4. In the beginning desire came over That [One], which became the first seed of mind. The sages by their pious insight in their heart (i. e., by introspection) found the relation of the Existent with the Non-existent. In RV 10. 72. 1 the rsis mystically perceive the cosmogonic process. 5. A line of demarcation was extended hori- zontally for them (the sages). What was below it, what above it? There were seed-depositors, there were powers; there was potentiality here below; there was emanation above. 6. Who is there who knows, who here (iha) can tell whence was the origin, and whence this crea- tion ? The gods are this side of the creation. Who knows, then, whence it came into being? In RV 10. 72. 6 the gods, as secondary crea- tors, stir up the dust, as though in dancing; cf. Indra in RV 1. 56. 4 and 10. 124. 9, per- haps also RV 4. 17. 13 and 4.42. a. 7. This creation, whence it came into being, whether spontaneously or not -he who is its high- est overseer in heaven, he surely knows, or perhaps he knows not.</page></plain_text>
