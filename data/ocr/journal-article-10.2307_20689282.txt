J. Zwi Werblowsky Translated from the German by Allan Arkush One of the most important scholars of our century, Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) opened up a once esoteric world of Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalah, to concerned students of religion. Origins of the Kabbalah is a major contribution to the history of Judaism. "Scholem's work on Jewish mysticism, messianism, and sectarianism, spanning now half a century, constitutes... one of the major achieve ments of the historical imagination in our time. I would contend that it is of vital interest not only to anyone concerned with the history of religion but to anyone struggling to understand the underlying problematics of the human predicament"?Robert Alter, Commentary "He [Scholem] labors the wealth, even the scandal, of the past in order to multiply options of survival. No great textual scholar, no master of philology and historical criticism commands a technique at once more scrupulously attentive to its object and more instinct with the writer's voice/'?George Steiner, The New Yorker Published in association with the Jewish Publication Society Paper. $14.95 ISBN 0-691-02047-7 doth: $47.50 ISBN 0-691-07314-7 AT YOUR BOOKSTORE OR Princeton University Press 41 WILLIAM ST. ?

( )ral I m?!i? ?on lo ti?* WritU-h Woril " Is scripture the literal word of God? Challenging the conviction that scripture cannot be tampered with, Rabbi Daniel Jeremy Silver argues that the truly creative era in each of the three major Western religious tradi tions?Judaism, Christianity, and Islam? * _ occurred before they had developed a written scripture. The Story of Scripture recounts how the spread of literacy among the upper classes? more than any religious imperative?prompted the community to write down its living oral traditions. The emergence of a scripture helped define a faith's teachings with greater precision but hampered the faith's freedom to adapt to changing circumstance. "A clear, deeply felt and elegant description by a liberal believer of the growth of the Jewish tradition. This modernist book is both learned and pious. Highly re mmended." ?Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, author o/The Jews in America "A clear, wide-ranging, and yet concise inquiry into the origins and development in the Jewish tradition, with important observations on the Christian and Islamic tradition as well." ?Peter Machinist, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor "A magnificent study of the development of the textual traditions held to be sacred by the Jewish people. His book illuminates many a dark corner in the development of Scripture for the modern reader...A first-rate piece of work." ?Rabbi Leonard S. Kravitz, Hebrew Union College "A controversial but interesting and lucid analysis of the development of scripture in Judaism." ?Library Journal $22.95 at bookstores or direct from BasicBooks mm A Division ofW^crQoW'msPublishers 10 E. 53rd St., NY, NY 10022.
