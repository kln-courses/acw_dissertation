<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION FROM MODERN ARCHITECTURE Three Bossom Lectures I by CHARLES JENCKS I BEngLitt(Harvard' В Arch(Harvard' DPhil{London) Architectural Association School of Architecture I. THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE delivered to the Society on Monday 14th May 1979, with Alvin Boy ar sky, Chairman, Architectural Association School of Architecture , in the Chair The Chairman : Lord Bossom, as you may know, was a British architect who spent his professional life for the most part in the United States building skyscrapers in New York City amonst other things, and when he died in the early sixties he left money to this institution to produce what has become a most interesting series of lectures. You may recall that in 1976-7 there were three lectures delivered by Messrs. Andrew Tait, H. G. Simpson and Douglas Tilbe ! on 'Housing for the People'. Before that Patrick Nuttgens delivered three lectures on 'Architec- ture and Society', and last year Mr. P. A. Faulkner delivered three lectures on ťA Philo- sophy for the Preservation of Our Historic Heritage'. So that the series has been wide- spread and for the benefit not only of the archi- tectural profession but the population at large. Tonight's speaker, Charles Jencks, has been a very popular lecturer both at the Architectural Association School of Architecture where he has been a member of the staff since 1968, and in the United States and Europe. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1939 and received the Bachelor of Arts degree at Harvard University, studying English Literature; followed by a period from 196 1-5 in the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He then came to Britain to study with Peter Reyner Banham at University College London, where he achieved his PhD in 1970. His books, which represent an astonishing output over a period of ten years, include the following: Meaning in Architecture (1969) with George Baird, Architecture 2000 (1971)5 a book with Nathan Silver entitled Ad Hocism published in 1972; Modern Movements in Architecture , which is largely derived from his PhD submis- sion at University College was published in 1973, followed by Le Corbusier and the Tragic View of Architecture in 1974. Perhaps his most important book in terms of influencing the langugage used about recent architectural manifestations is The Language of Post-Modern Architecture published in 1977. Those of you who were shopping for picture books at Christmas in 1978 may have seen his Daydream Houses of Los Angeles. With regard to the lecture this evening, it seems to me that giving recent Japanese archi- tecture a special place in a series of this sort, is a hallmark of Charles Jenck's style. He has been collecting evidence of recent goings on in various parts of the world in order to make some order of it, and it is typical that he will not be con- centrating on the work of Kenzo Tange and his generation of architects, who soon after World War II, relying on their experiences in Europe, were attempting to produce an architecture not unlike the architecture in the court of Le Corbusier and others associated with the Modern Movement. Nor will he be emphasizing the generation of Metabolists who followed from the Kenzo Tange stable. In fact he will be empha- sizing a generation of whom I am sure very little is known or understood. We were lucky at the Architectural Association last year to have an exhibition of the work of six of them, the most prominent of whom is the architect called Ishii. The majority of the work he will be talking about will be work done in the last five years. The following lecture , which was illustrated , was then delivered. 742</page><page sequence="2">NOVEMBER I979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE IT to emergent is fitting, give these architecture and indeed lectures a in pleasure this on fine the for build- new, me, to give these lectures on the new, emergent architecture in this fine build- ing of the Adam brothers. As you will see, some of the Post-Modern architecture I will be showing is part-Adam, Adamesque or maybe Adamoid - sometimes a pastiche of these great architects - and it is comforting to know that while Robert Adam would, no doubt, have suffered eye-cramps from much of what I will show, he might also have had a secret sympathy with it. His own work also distorted a previous language of architecture; it was full of neologisms and even vulgarity. Surprisingly some people consider the Adam brothers the height of good taste, while others, including myself, value them both for this and their garish design ideas : those indescribable colour mixes of pinks and greens, those strange flat patterns which seem like architectural 'transfers' - the decorative details which were mass-produced and plastered on to walls and ceilings as if they were made to-day like a 'plastic transfer'. Horace Walpole scoffed at the 'gingerbread and sippets of embroidery' while Chambers called it 'filigrane toy work'. Joseph Gwilt, in his Encyclopaedia of Architecture , 1842, was slightly more outspoken: 'the vile taste of Robert Adam, a fashionable architect whose eye had been ruined by the corrup- tions of the worst period of Roman art ... '. Such condemnations you will hear to-day made by the Old Modern architects against their successors. Robert Adam was a great architect partly because he accepted the cruder and more commercial aspects of design as part of his job. Many Post-Modern architects use motifs - -colours, symbols and forms - in questionable taste and their work is the richer for it since it communicates quite directly to many different people, or to the same person in one of his different moods. This is one aspect of the Japanese pluralism: it appeals to a wider spectrum of emotions and tastes than did Modernism. Another reason for citing the example of the Adams, and the bad taste of good taste, is that it brings into focus the necessary conflict within pluralism. Perhaps this conflict, and disgust at the new directions in architecture so evident at present, does not go as far as Gwilt's total condemnation, but there is certainly a surplus of contempt in the air. This strong disagreement is a necessary adjunct of pluralism. The trends that have evolved in Japan since 1970 can roughly be divided into Late-Modern and Post-Modern archi- tecture. Late-Modernism takes the ideas and forms of the Modern Movement to an extreme, exaggerating the structure and technological image of the building beyond the point which the Modernists would have found acceptable, sometimes meriting the label 'High-Tech' as a result. Post- Modernism, on the other hand, reintroduces aspects denied by Modern architecture: applied ornament and symbolism to name two. A basic definition to keep in mind throughout these talks is that Post- Modernism is 'doubly-coded', that is one- half Modern and one-half something else, usually traditional. Both Late and Post- Modernism are at an early stage of evolution and the architectural results are thus some- times less than satisfying. Yet this period is full of promise - more so than that of the early Modern Movement, because we stand on the threshold of an era when architecture is being rediscovered as an art with its own internal rules, and with a link to the past. In many countries, in Japan, in America and in Europe, architects are looking back to their historical traditions, while, at the same time, across space to other countries. Secondly there is more building being produced to-day, good and bad, than at any time in history. This boom, coupled with an explosion of creativity, is both exciting and violent. It is not a peaceful time, but then neither was the Renaissance and, as a Chinese adage puts it - 'may you be cursed to live in interesting times'. It is a time when 'everything is happening at once', when many generalizations are true, when Seifert and Stirling are contending but powerless, when many schools of archi- tecture compete, when computer design vies with an exquisite revivalism; in short it is a time of turbulent pluralism. No country is more culturally vigorous than Japan. The explosion in Japan started in the middle fifties with the quick expansion of the economy due in part to the Korean War boom. During that period a group of Western-trained architects started to domin- ate the architectural culture : Junzo Sakakura, Kunio Maekawa and Kenzo Tange, the 'Big Three' as they were known, who were either directly trained by Le Corbusier or inspired by his recent work in reinforced concrete. They started producing very sculptural architecture in what now can be 743</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure i.

A mixture of traditional motifs - bevelled mast , gently sloping roof , constructional expression - with Modern ones : catenary curves and reinforced concrete. (. Photograph , Charles Jencks ) seen to be a Late-Modern style : exaggerated and heavy concrete forms only made less brutalist by the typical Japanese attention to careful detailing and precision building. Part of this work was directly influenced by traditional Japanese archi tecture, and it is this part, dubbed 'The New Japan Style' by Robin Boyd, which is more clearly Post- Modern. On the one hand it emphasized Modern aesthetic values - structural honesty and straightforward use of materials - and on the other hand traditional ones: the gently upturned, swooping roofs, bevelled masts and constructional expressionism. A characteristic work would thus look hybrid: it would have a traditional post and beam character carried through in concrete, not wood. Constructional elements would be exaggerated in size just the way a Shinto shrine would overscale its wooden pins ( muchikake ) and forked finials ( chigi ). The results were delightfully ambiguous: un- mistakeably in the Western tradition of sculptural expression and clearly 'Japanese'. A purist would condemn the hybrids as inauthentic - neither good Modernism nor acceptable traditionalism. Indeed this is still a common response to Post-Modern buildings, for if they are doubly-coded they 744 are open to attack from two sides, from those Modernists such as Siegfried Giedion and Aldo Van Eyck who wish to keep the faith pure, and those Anti-Modernists, like my friend Conrad Jameson, who wish to keep the faith dead. Both damn Post-Modernism as schizophrenic and both are, in a sense, right to do so. Japan, however, with its strong traditions of Buddhist pluralism, sees nothing wrong with interweaving opposites. Their everyday life is based on accepting contradiction: Western dress and the Kimono, Western social ideas and a traditional society. A Western Post-Modern architect whom we shall look at next week writes a manifesto on Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture , while the Japanese practise this doctrine unconsciously the minute they rise in the morning. Obviously it is important for Post-Modern- ists to justify their philosophy of contra- diction, or more generally pluralism, against the attacks of those who would argue for a single style and unified philosophy. These justifications will reappear throughout the lectures. After the 'first wave' of the 'Big Three' came the second wave more powerfully, a group known as the Metabolists who were</page><page sequence="4">NOVEMBER I979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE Figure 2.

Indeed, the two interests went hand in hand and emerged into view with the first World Design Congress of i960. Young, very young, designers in their twenties put forward manifestoes and projects that were intended to force Modern architecture in a new direction. Kiy onori Kikutake's ťCity over the sea', Kisho Kurokawa's 'Helical City' and a host of other grandiose schemes did in fact change the way architects thought about the city and its constant 'metabolism', growth and decay. They substituted the organic, biological metaphor for the mechanistic one - 'the machine for living', the functional aesthetic, the foundation of Modernism. In retrospect, however, it is not their anti-Modernism which looks so significant, but rather their link, once again, with traditionalism. Although Kikutake builds gigantic floating platforms that are at least villages over the sea, it is his smaller, modest work in a hybrid style that is convincing. The Token Hotel, 1964, for instance, mixes traditional roof forms and bracket construction with a functional articulation to symbolize the different parts of the 745</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 3.

Photograph , Tornio Ohashi) building. It is this intention to symbolize, particularly through the use of conventional signs, which makes the work characteristic of Post-Modernism. Kisho Kurokawa, who is known popularly as 'the capsule architect' because of his plug-in apartment boxes in Tokyo, is equally part futurist and part traditionalist. The round-hole capsules resemble round- hole tea ceremony rooms, and they are used in a partly traditional manner, as flexible homes away from home for the traveller. One could point out further historical references - again the bevelled mast, the Zen aesthetics of incompletion, the Taoist emphasis on growth and constant change. Kurokawa, with his love of inventing complex neologisms, can give three more Buddhist justifications for his capsules, but it is clear to everyone that these buildings are technological fantasies, quite zany, and delightfully so. It is their bizarre futurist programme, their multi-track stereo and built-in computer consoles, which have made them renowned, and partly led to Kurokawa being 'the Third most Popular Person in Japan5 (where they keep this sort of statistic). One should stop for a moment on this popularity, for it does represent something exceptional for an architect, especially one misconceived to be a Modern architect. Kurokawa moves quite assuredly across the spectrum of a consumer society. He has his regular TV broadcast, interviewing 746 other celebrities in front of - is it 30 million Japanese ? He moves easily among prime ministers and, as I have found, the café society of Tokyo and Kyoto. He runs a think-tank of thirty specialists, a planning office of forty designers and an atelier of an hundred architects. He designs projects for Bulgaria, Moscow, Italy, South America; Chairman Mao, he said, was after him too. This extraordinary success has produced an interesting pluralism in his approach, which can be seen to a lesser degree in all the Japanese designers. It has forced him to adapt many styles in a single building, or according to Post-Modern theoretical terminology, design for different 'taste cultures'. Like the Adam brothers he can produce overripe details in a revivalist style: he 'does' the Renaissance style in his Big Box building with a 'vernacular' piazza and a gigantic plastic tree shooting up the middle of it. The incongruity and vulgarity disturb serious architects, just as Kurokawa's excessive success annoys them; so one might mention the positive evolutionary aspects of his position. Unlike the typical Modern architect, Kurokawa can design appropriately for a consumer society when it is producing its characteristic leisure facili- ties. The Big Box, for instance, is a large collection of entertainment and sport facili- ties. There are swimming pools and race tracks on some floors, golfing and duck shooting (by laser gun) on others. The very idea of such a facility, the 'Funplace' of the</page><page sequence="6">NOVEMBER 1979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE sixties, is typical of a mass society and it clearly entails the fabrication of phoney styles, applied symbolism and fake ambience. Architects, by tradition and training, don't want to move in such a world, possibly because it is so commercial and immersed in kitsch. But Post-Modernists have tentatively entered the field, and Kurokawa has shown at least one way in which they can keep their integrity and creativity while doing so. He designs the ersatz ambience and the beautifully detailed technology; he designs both for the day-tripper and the specialized architect. It is this aspect of double-coding which overcomes, in a minor way, the problem of Modern architecture: it was so pure, so high-minded in its social responsi- bility that it often failed to reach society. It alienated the very working class it was meant to serve. Kurokawa, one of the most successful establishment architects since Bernini, has, like Bernini, recourse to all the styles of rhetoric, from low to high. He moves easily and effectively across the taste- cultures which normally keep everyone locked into his own happy ghetto. It is perhaps no surprise that among the seven- teen learned societies of which he is a member, one should be the Royal Society of Arts. The kind of architecture that Kurokawa designs varies from the hybrid Post- Modernism to the single-track Late- Modernism. Many of the works are in what has been called the 'techno-aesthetic', the Japanese version of High Tech, with its exaggerated tubes of structure and its over- blown joinery. This school of Late Modernism has many practitioners, among them the large firms such as the Nikken Sekki contractors (an equivalent of Y R M in England) and the mechanistic fantasts, individualists such as Youiji Watanabe. Nearly every Japanese designer has a commitment to a high technological finish and detailing; it can be assumed as part of the architectural culture just as precision engineering is part of the building culture. This technical sophistication is itself the sign of a national style on a par with con- ventional imagery. The most favoured architect, Arata Isozaki, the 'architect's architect' as opposed to Kurokawa the populist architect, always conveys a tech- nical sophistication in his style. Indeed all five of his concurrent styles bespeak pro- fessionalism to an aggressive degree. Even American or German architecture looks a bit thrown together when compared with the precisionist craftsmanship of his high- gloss aluminium detailing. It approaches the condition of modern jewellery, the machine-tooled perfection that Le Corbusier wrote about with such lyricism. And yet in important ways it is Late-Modern architect- ure that Isozaki practises rather than the Modernism with which it is popularly confused. The Gunma Museum, for instance, takes the grid, the very symbol of Modernism, to an obsessive extreme, playing it at five different scales and playing it solo, in polished silver aluminium, as the only motif. This exaggeration of a single motif so that it takes over the whole building is typical of Late-Modernism ; we shall see it in the grandiose American hotels of John Portman and the extremely reduced work of Norman Foster. But there are two aspects of Isozaki's work that are Post-Modern as well. His use of five different styles, his instant revivalism that makes use of the styles of Mies, Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Archigram and Superstudio, de- pending on the job in hand and the whim of Isozaki that day. This revivalism, which is partly serious, is an important aspect of Post-Modernism since it rests on the defensible idea that an architect's style should vary according to differing functions and taste - cultures. This idea is obviously anathema to Modernists and Late- Modernists, who still believe a single style, conceived with an industrial aesthetic, should unify a disparate society. The other Post- Modern aspect of Isozaki is his interest in architectural meaning and the metaphysical symbolism behind form. Like a Renaissance architect he sees ultimate significance lying behind his gridded cages and their particular silver-grey colour. He interprets these qualities metaphysically in terms of twilight and illusion. Shadows give things differentiation and a sense of actuality. Shadowless twilight is a metaphor for the suppression of visual differentiation. Minimizing differences reduces disturbances caused by information from the outside to the lowest level and makes possible the creation in architecture of something like artificial twilight. Cover ing the exterior of buildings with endless series of uniform units (a process I call ampli- fication) minimizes differences and produces a twilight effect of nondifferentiation . . . Pale colours in limited distribution cause shadow and shade to unite with the base tone and thus obscure the distinction between actuality and illusion. 747</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 4. Arata Isozaki , Gunma Museum, 1974. The exaggerated repetition of a single motif ( here the silver square) is typical of Late- Modernism. The symbolic concerns are , however , characteristic of Post- Modernism. (. Photograph , Japan Architect) We can see these ambiguous properties best when it is twilight, and the grey form has merged imperceptibly into the broken silhouette of the industrial landscape. Another more metaphysical reason for resorting to the neutral cage is our present lack of an accepted ideology and religion. We have no means of becoming clearly cognizant of the universe; we have lost our context; and everything seems isolated, unique, and un- repeatable. Not only has God disappeared, but we have become incapable of arriving at an interpretation of the universe that all of us can share . . . illusive images surround us with a 748 mosaic that lacks classical balance, consistent clarity of arrangement, harmony and order. We have no way of recognizing relative, wildly dispersed world images. It may be that there is no longer any one theme deserving expression. I represent this set of circumstances by means of a metaphor of degree zero, or a void at the centre. 1 This particularly clear statement of metaphysical agnosticism, or nullity, ex- plains not only so much of Isokaki's silent grids, but also much of the symbolic architecture I will consider shortly. It is a paradoxically religious architecture without</page><page sequence="8">NOVEMBER I979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE a religion, an architecture which wishes to assert order and absolute values in a world which so obviously lacks them. Indeed Isokaki now produces buildings based on the Platonic cube and cylinder, images which he abstracts from Palladian architecture and Western sacred architecture of the Renais- sance. The Fuj ima Country Club, 1974, in the primary shape of a black, silent barrel vault which twists into the form of a meta- physical question-mark, ends with a version of Palladio's Villa Poiana. Why, the question- mark seems to ask, why Palladio in a Japanese country club ? There is clearly no answer to this, just as there isn't to any ultimate question. The metaphysical school of Post- Modernists, with Isozaki as its leader, puts these questions in both an absurd and sensible form. Mayumi Miyawaki, for instance, designs a series of defensive buildings, buildings in primary colours and forms, which turn their backs on the external world and open inwards to light, air and greenery. Miyawaki resorts to this defensive architecture - he has built twenty or so box buildings as houses and banks - not only as a 'metaphysical shock tactic', but also because the Japanese environment has become so hostile. The concrete box is a defence against noise, pollution and a terrible view. One of his early buildings, the Blue Box House, 1972, perches precariously on the side of a hill amidst urban sprawl and greenery. The outside primary forms ex- clude contact - except for a small porthole which commands a view of Mount Fujii. Also, one corner of the pure form is violated to allow bamboo trees to penetrate up into an enclosed, interior garden. The interior spaces provide everything that the harsh exterior rejects : complex flowing geometries, traditional tatami room, lush furnishing and peaceful, controlled nature. A skylight illuminates the central stair well which is designed in opposition to the grid. The architect Monta Mozuna takes this defensive metaphysical architecture into the regions of paradox and black humour. For instance, the Anti-Dwelling, a series of three identical boxes telescoped within themselves, does provide a retreat from urban strife, but also a repeated series of concrete cages. The house is for Mozuna's Mother (Post-Modernists, as any new movement, experiment on members of the family) and it must be somewhat Figure 5. Monta Mozuna , Anti-Dwelling, Hokkaido , 1972-3. A metaphysical surplus with thirteen iconological ideas motivating the form. oppressive with its incessant repetition of the same idiosyncratic box at three scales. It is the mixture of seriousness and black humour which justifies this paradoxical building. Usually there are many boxes within a house, for example the television, jewel box, room. In a house, one is always in boxes, between boxes and outside of them. When you have discovered that a house is assembled from a great many boxes, you make a paradox about a house. He quotes from Mother Goose in support of his argument : There was a little green house And in the little green house There was a little brown house And in the little brown house There was a little yellow house And in the little yellow house There was a little white house And in the little white house There was a little heart.2 Further justifications of Mozuna include the mandala form, an imago nundi , and the notions of miniaturism and the mirror- image. These are key notions and forms of 749</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER I979 Figure 6. Osamu Ishiyama , Pipe House, combines re-used industrial elements with anthropomorphic and historicist meanings. Japanese tradition and religion. Indeed the striking aspect of Mozuna's work is its surplus of metaphysical meanings. He relates his architecture directly to Inca myths, Shinto, Pythagorean interpretations of the universe, Asimov's science fiction, Chinese Ying and Yang philosophy, the secret ceremonies of the Cabala and Karl Jung's collective unconscious - to name roughly half the references. This is primarily an inflation of metaphysics. Where the Renaissance signified basically two meta- physics in its buildings - Christian theology and Platonic mysticism - Mozuna signifies thirteen. We might at first wish to criticize this kind of pluralism, a confusing amalgam that can never make up its mind what exactly is to be believed. On the other hand we might applaud Mozuna's courage in attempting to represent our present un- certainty. Where other architects would hide their agnosticism behind a technological neutrality, he at least wishes to insist that architecture always has a metaphysical rôle, even when the metaphysics are confused. There are further benefits to the meta- physical architecture that ought to be stressed, which relate to its defensive side. Many of the houses produced by this school - those of Hiroshi Нага and Takefumi 750 I Aida, 3 to name two more of its members - I 3 ! provide a traditional sense of security and order so lacking in Modern architecture. They establish a clear boundary to the private dwelling, and a clear centre or 'heart' to the house, images and meanings which the open plan and homogeneous space of Modernism had destroyed. Charles Moore, the American Post-Modernist whom we shall mention next week, has written a book around this subject - Body , Memory and Architecture , while Hiroshi Нага has written : Homogeneous space tends to atomize human relationships ... if you agree that homogeneous I space is negative and undesirable, then we must ! somehow regain control of the Post-Modern spatial order. ... A house . . . must possess a strong independent centre. This creates a regular order that is opposed to the surrounding i homogeneous space outside.3 His work, like that of the others, makes use of strong enclosures, repetitive grids, axial symmetries, mirror images, Palladian motifs and a religious handling of objects. Interior volumes are arranged as so many altars, hieratically fixed on an axis of light which runs down the spine of the building. Semi-circular forms recall tombs to a saint, the silent, pure abstract form is a place for</page><page sequence="10">NOVEMBER I979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE meditation. Here the outside world has been excluded, and the individual given a psycho- logical shelter which is fundamental to the traditional concept of the house. In this sense the metaphysical school of Post- Modernists have supplied exemplary models of dwelling that relate us to the past. There is another identifiable group of Post-Modernists who do not form as distinct a school, but who nonetheless have enough in common to be grouped together under a wide category. This might be termed either Historicist or Semiotic, since their commitment varies from quoting the historical past to designing cultural meaning into architecture. Opposed to the neutrality of Modernism, they place metaphysical buildings; opposed to the stripped surface, they place ornament, both organic and applied. The work of Osamu Ishiyama illustrates these aspects. His Pipe Houses, houses cheaply assembled from industrial products packaged within sewer pipes, incorporate all sorts of ornamental motifs including stained glass, incised masonry, and Adam- esque fan-lights. One Pipe House, called 'Fantasy Villa5, takes on the anthropom- orphic metaphor common to so much Post- Modernism : it resembles, as traditional bungalows often do, the physiognomy of a face, but also recalls other animal and organic images. The argument supporting this anthropomorphism is long and involved. Suffice it to say that Post-Modernists have substituted the body metaphor for the machine metaphor, because so much re- search has shown that we unconsciously project bodily states into architecture. We empathize with the parts of a house, the columns, the balance of load and support, we quite unconsciously refer to the 'heart', the centre, the front and back, up and down. The face image, with its eye-window, pitched head and mouth- door is only the most potent and ubiquitous of many other body images we find in popular architect- ure. The particular virtue of Ishiyama's work is that it combines this imagery, and ornament, with a modern technological rationale : a perfect illustration of the double- coding of Post -Modernism. Indeed the rationale is ecological as well as cultural. Ishiyama sees the significance of his work in terms of recycling industrial products and cultural pluralism. In the near future, Tokyo will become a huge melting pot containing more different cultures and differing, though coexisting, ideologies than any other place in the world . . . [Architecture] will erode and will distort the various structures inherent in the city and will convert them from former uses to newer ones . . . And this point will make it possible to find the kind of cultural significance that architecture has manifested in the past. 4 Kazuhiro Ishii, an architect trained under Charles Moore at Yale, also uses a plurality of industrial products to articulate a plurality of meanings and ideologies. His house for a doctor, called '54 Windows', incorporates 'a large number of differing windows to symbolize a Japanese regional- ism'. We might be sceptical of this, but Ishii insists that Japanese regionalism consists essentially of 'excess and display', and so, with his green and orange boxes projecting from the white concrete frame, he has tried to capture these essentially vulgar qualities. He also argues that the symbols - the die numbers, and colour code - relate to regional and popular signs. Clearly they are also adopted for the metaphysical reasons that Aida also uses the die: its arbitrary con- nection to the house as an element of a game - throwing dice - is contradicted by its morphological similarity (i.e. round win- dows, boxiness). These houses with the shape of dice are clear illustrations of the new idiosyncrasy: they replace impersonal images of Modernism with extreme ex- amples of individualism. An institution such as a school cannot be as idiosyncratic as a house, and so Ishii's Naoshima School, 1977, uses more general- ized images - a rectangular assembly room, a traditional pitched-roof gate and a colon- nade. This last element modulates back and forth in a rather jerky and syncopated manner. The rhythm is a complicated alternation of bays (A, B, A, C, A, B, 2A, C, A, C, A, B, 2A, C, A, B, A, C, 2A, C), and these bays have above them a differing rhythm of windows and triangular decora- tions. Ishii intends here a Post-Modern colonnade, one which frames the view and decorates the shed behind, and recalls the colonnades of the Renaissance. More particularly he plays on the Renaissance 'problem of the colonnade', the problem of interior corners and consistency, by varying his columnar rhythms and occasionally leaving out columns (indicating this with hanging capitals, steel bars that reach down and await their concrete). These Mannerist 751</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 7. Kazuhiro Ishii , '54 Windows', House and Office for a doctor , 7976-7. The attempt to represent the heterogeneity of a city , some regional aspects and the arbitrary relation between form and content (1 boxes , dice , and window). {Photograph by Tohru Waki ) jokes are obviously appreciated most by those who know Giulio Romano, but they are clearly enough expressed - by remaining capital and base - to be understood by the children at school. Minoru Takeyama has been most deeply involved with architecture as communica- tion, with the general area of semiotics, and since I have illustrated his building, Ni Bahn Kahn, twice on the cover of The Language of Post- Modernism, there is no need to further publicize his intentions. They are similar to the previous ones: to make architecture into a communicational tool, a rhetorical device, something under- played by the Modern Movement. 752 Yasufumi Kijima's Matsuo shrine is less well known, but equally striking. It is a barrel-vaulted colonnade stuck at right angles to a traditional Japanese shrine. The mixture of East and West is hallucinatory : the Japanese roof and chigi set against the Pantheon coffers and decorated columns. Further details make the building still more unearthly. The concrete columns have thinner proportions than masonry ones, the zig-zag capital decorations recall Art Deco sources; the precisionist arch and machine-tooled cladding give a delirious quality to hand-crafted symbols.

( Photography Architectural Review) kind of decoration which Modernists found unacceptable both because it was not made by hand and because it did look brittle. The arguments against machine-tooled ornament and applied decoration can be put strongly, and they have been, by Ruskin and more recently Joseph Rykwert. Their points can, however, be countered by the advantages ornament brings: it provides scale and an intermediate articulation to the huge buildings we produce to-day. It can symbolize different functions as Robert Venturi has argued, provide visual amuse- ment to a dull façade and articulate light and shadow as it always has done. Finally, as Kijima himself avers, it can classify the mood of a space, or give a particular character to the ambience. Each part of a building should have its own innate life. Substantiating the boundaries among these various parts is architectural design . . . One of the major points in style is the ability of ornament within a style to communicate a definite mood.6 We are close here to a theory of Radical Eclecticism, a theory I and others have recently put forward to justify the use of different styles in a single building. We will see more convincing examples of this next week in the work of Charles Moore. Suffice it to say now, and in conclusion to this lecture on Japanese pluralism, that eclecticism seems to be the proper response to a plural culture. Unlike Modernism, which admitted of only one style when it admitted of style at all, Radical Eclecticism admits all styles and chooses any particular mixture according to three requirements: the context that the building fits into, the character of the particular functions which must be enhanced by style, and the taste- culture of the inhabitants (or the taste of the particular client). Any of these three requirements might generate ornament and traditional style, the anthropomorphic meta- phor and explicit vulgarity, technological fantasy and metaphysical buildings, in short those aspects I have characterized as typical 753</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 of the emergent Japanese architecture. There is no single Japanese building which crystal- lizes Radical Eclecticism with complete success partly because there is no architect who completely espouses the philosophy. But the overall trend is in this direction, an exciting and powerful one. We are, as I said, on the edge of a new tradition which takes some aspects of the Modern Move- ment and combines them with the much richer traditions of architecture that existed in the past.

DISCUSSION Mr. Robert Byng, ariba: I have been fas- cinated by Dr. Jencks's talk, but I was struck by the very obvious absence from both his talk and Philip Johnson's messages of the last ten days, while he was in London - the absence of any reference to morality. I was brought up to read the four or five great moralists in aesthetic criticism : Ruskin, Lethaby, Scott, and Le Corbusier. Might I ask Dr. Jencks if he would consider this point, and perhaps in his two subsequent lectures comment on the absence of the use of the word morality in relation to aesthetics. The Lecturer: I will bring this question up next week for a small period. I think in general one can say that the confusion of archi- tecture with morality was of course attacked at the time it was being made. So, for instance, in Scott's The Architecture of Humanism he was attacking the moral fallacy. Yet at the same time he was implicitly proposing one, a moral attitude mediated through aesthetics. He said that archi- tecture is about the empathetic projection of bodily states into it, which Classical architecture does so well. It is a point which clearly many Post-Modernists follow. I know Philip Johnson does, for instance, and Charles Moore does in his arguments, so that morality pushed out through one door is brought in through another. Maybe that is one answer to the question, that you cannot have an architecture that does not raise moral questions and answer them to a certain degree. The Post-Modernists' attitude towards morality is, I think, different from the Ruskinian one. Although they are interested in relations between fabrication, handicraft and the enjoyment of work they do not argue that happy workers necessarily produce happy build- ings and good ornament. For instance, Kuro- kawa makes the anti-Ruskinian point that pre- fabricating his buildings down at the factory produces workers happier than those working at the building site when it is raining. So moral arguments are there however you finally answer them. They are very involved questions, from the most profound to the most trivial. Personally I would think that those architects I was dealing with are highly moral, certainly on a meta- physical level, and it is that which I was trying to 754 bring out. They do see architecture as a meta- physical art, among other arts. It is also a social art, and an aesthetic art. But it has its meta- physical dimension and they are honest to that and they are very honest to their uncertainty, very honest to paradox, very honest to things that are traditional to Japanese culture, Zen aesthetics the No-play and so forth. Morality is involved with all of this. The Chairman: You are talking about a progressive history of events somehow culminat- ing in the pattern described this evening. It would be interesting to hear about your con- tribution to this, in that the story is yours. T he Lecturer : Well of course I have only given an argument for Radical Eclecticism. I think that it is more adequate to a plural culture than Modern architecture was. It deals with the obvious sub-cultures which exist in any large city. In America of course it is clear what those ethnic groups are ; it is less clear, say, in England, but I think any sociologist could point out three or four different languages being spoken in any large city and different, if not ethnic groups, at least sub-cultures, which have conflicting views of the good life. I would say it is a moral argument to advocate an eclecticism (I will go into the reasons why I call it a Radical Eclecticism next week) which can design in different styles to give the good life as seen by some of these sub-cultures. It is wrong, it seems to me, as the Modernists argue, to look on the architect's rôle as being like that of a doctor who prescribes one medicine in one style. That is not the architect's rôle. I think he has a relationship with his clients and his users which is rather like that of a lawyer. He represents them and he should represent their view of the good life. So that is one reason for eclecticism and I think it is a moral one. The second one is to do with the builder's functions. It seems to me, as the Adams knew well, and as Kurokawa knows well, that a build- ing should (and this is a moral statement) be characterized in different ways. Different rooms should have different feelings. This lecture hall is styled, if you like, in a different way from the entrance hall.</page><page sequence="14">NOVEMBER I979 THE PLURALISM OF RECENT JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE Mr. Byng : I would not agree that the style of this hall is different from the style of the entrance hall. The Lecturer: Well, the use of paint- ings, the gilding and the colour and so on at least create a different ambience - if not a totally different style. I think that classical rhetoric, with its emphasis on high and low, preached that every day. Another aspect of eclecticism which is emphasized (and this will be in the third lecture) is the relation between a building and its context. The urban context, because it varies, should generate different styles and types of layout. Mr. Nathan Silver (Head, Department of Architecture, NE London Polytechnic): In view of the fact that the title is about pluralism, I was wondering what the impact of these buildings actually is. Most of them are new to me. One can imagine that in America, for example, these buildings could either be ignored and not noticed, or else cause the most tremen- dous furore. In Britain those buildings would probably be ignored, at least in the general social world. But in Japanese society, do these have any impact at all ? The Lecturer : It very much matters which buildings you mean among that group that I showed. In this country if the Anti-Dwelling went up for someone's mother it would be in The Sun and other newspapers, so I do not think it would be ignored. Several others of that extra- ordinary type of paradoxical building would be looked at and made into a joke, just as, for example the work of a group called SITE has been in the Sunday Supplements in this country. That sort of architecture which is humorous and paradox- ical does at least make a splash, and would make a splash in this country. The work of Kurokawa is very popular on some levels. For instance the Big Box - I went through it with him - is enjoyed by the people who use it and who run it. Partly of course this is the way the whole Japanese culture works - what is called 'Japan Incorporated* - from the Emperor down to the man in the street there is a chain of mutual responsibility. So that Kurokawa as an architect goes back to the build- ing and feels part of that building, and the building is part of him, and he has a kind of reciprocal obligation with the users to making sure that the building works. However, his other buildings, some of them the Capsule Buildings, are attacked not only by other architects but by many people in the area. Not the people who use them - the people who use them love it. The 40 million people who watched him on television characterized him as a 'capsule architect' and they say, 'Well he is fine. Let him build at the World's Fair, but we do not want him to build our house.' He enjoys a strange relationship with his audience. He is popular on the one hand and 'not for me' on the other. Mr. Silver: I was not talking about con- troversial buildings. Those obviously would attract attention, no matter where. But something like the last shown, with that very complex eclecticism, would take a lot of understanding, a lot of information to understand. You can explain it to us, but what sort of reception does a build- ing like that have ? The Lecturer: It is not received well by the architectural establishment. But I think the people who use the shrine find it appropriate because it is using detail and imagery that relate to religious iconography; so in a sense, although it is hallucinatory because of its mixture, it is somewhat appropriate. Mr. Byng: That last building, which we have just been discussing, fascinated me. My attitude was that the quality of the pastiche was stronger than the quality of the scholarship, but I must admit that I got this impression after your description of it and I am not at all sure whether if I had seen it without your commentary I would have come to the same opinion. I would say that pastiche is often another word for super- ficial, and at a lecture like this we are surely not interested in the superficial ? The Lecturer: I began by talking about the 'vulgarity' of the Adam brothers. I was shocked, as you might have been shocked, by Kijima's building. I was shocked when I first went into Robert Adam's Syon House. I could not believe the vulgarity and pastiche of this architecture. Mr. Byng: Surely someone like Soane would have despised Adam. The Lecturer: Soane, of course looked at him, and a lot of Soane's work is also pastiche. One man's pastiche is another man's great revival. That is one answer to your question - that you cannot obviously legislate a clear distinction. For instance, comic opera of the seventeenth century turned into Mozart, and Mozart is pastiche, and what lovely pastiche! I would not say that Kijima is Mozart; clearly he is not. However, he is definitely trying. That is different from not trying. I do want to make the point that all of these Post-Modernists, particularly Charles Moore, who we shall look at next week, are very interested in pastiche. There being no further questions , the meeting concluded with the usual demonstration of appreci- ation. 755</page><page sequence="15">II. AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE delivered on Monday 21st May 1979 &gt; with Robert M. Maxwell , В Arch, Reader , Bartlett School of Architecture and Planning , University College London , in the Chair The Chairman : Whereas most architects, who are expected to be fairly well educated people, have to achieve 'O' Levels in English, Charles Jencks achieved a full degree in English. This has a great advantage, because when he began to study the history of architecture, particularly the history of modern architecture, he was able to write about it. I have always enjoyed his writing; it has a genial quality and it cheers you up. Tonight, I hope, we shall have another chance of being cheered up. The following lecture , which was illustrated , was then delivered . 1AST -/the architectural week emergent I spoke culture eclecticism about in the Japan explosive which and I architectural culture in Japan and -/the emergent eclecticism which I termed radical. The use of this term is no doubt fashionable; everything has to be 'radical' to-day as everything had to be 'modern' yesterday, but there is a more serious reason for the prefix. Architects are looking for an eclecticism which is fitting to a pluralistic society and one which goes beyond the easy shuffling of styles in the nineteenth century. Even then there were many critics of the facile mixing of styles, against a weak aestheticism and permissive jumbling of this and that. Eclecticism when so opportunistic was called 'indifferentism', its botched hybrids were called 'mongrel' architecture or, even worse, 'macaronic'. Positively it was seen as the Queen Anne revival ('a gothic game played with neo-classical counters' as Goodhart-Rendel put it) and later the Yachting Style, Youth Style, Liberty Style, Art Nouveau and Free Style. Between opportunism and freedom, shallowness and creativity, this eclecticism swung, never reaching finally a firm philosophical basis and teachable body of theory. This, Radical Eclecticism aspires to do - put the illicit practice into the academy where it can be taught and talked about with conviction; but the aspiration may be wishful thinking on my part as it has not quite yet happened. What has occurred, in America particularly, is a widening body of eclectic practice which, like the Japanese, is reflecting the variety of ethnic cultures, the proverbial melting- pot of American life which never quite melts down the ethnic groups into one homogenized Yankee. We shall look at various eclecticisms within Post-Modernism 756 varying from the superficial to the profound, from weak to Radical Eclecticism. But I want to start, as last week, with those architects who have slowly evolved out of Modernism without entirely giving up its practice, that is the Late-Modernists. Quite obviously these architects have reacted against the failures of Modern architecture just as much as other groups. Where Modern architects produced the 'dumb box', the blank parallelopiped of glass and steel, they have produced the sensuous, kinky box, a slick-tech skyscraper of mirror-plate which is humorous rather than dull. Or they have resorted to articulat- ing the surface to give visual delight, extreme articulation, which makes them, once again, Late rather than High Modernists. The most convincing of these Late- Modernists, as well as one of the first, was Louis Kahn who, in the late fifties, started designing building around exaggerated joints and technical elements such as extract ventilators. Where Modern architecture was brittle and flat, his buildings were heavy and powerful; they embodied the sculptural weight of the Classical tradition, its gravitas. Louis Kahn also looked to traditional architecture for cues - to San Gimignano, Mycenae and Rome - but he kept this historical reminiscence very much in the background as a Modernist would. Thus one of his last buildings, the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, has its Roman barrel-vaults and Beaux-Arts sym- metry, but these references are completely absorbed within the primitive forms, the blank surfaces, the reinforced concrete and primary forms. This is not real eclecticism or Post-Modernism, it is the clever and</page><page sequence="16">NOVEMBER I979 AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE Figure i. Louis Kahn&gt; Kimball Art Museum, Fort Worth , 1972-4. Very primitive vaults , reminiscent of Roman construction , are composed on a Beaux- Arts symmetrical plan with a Modern , asymmetrical entrance. The major car entry is suppressed in back implicit use of history which Mies and Le Corbusier would have allowed themselves. And the results are as entirely convincing as the work of these Modernists; that is as long as one looks clearly at the spiritual expression of building and does not ask embarrassing questions, such as, 'Where is the entrance? How does the building relate to Fort Worth, the Texan culture and the variety of art displayed within?'. Such issues of content were not addressed by Kahn any more than they are by Modern- ists and Late-Modernists. The content of their architecture is the structure, space and pure form and it is these values which they hope to substitute for the missing ones. When these values are successfully realized we overlook the obvious faults ; convincing architecture makes hypocrites of us all, makes us 'suspend our disbelief' and balance aesthetic gains against symbolic short- comings. Late-Modernism is dependent on such trade-offs for its appreciation. Obviously weighted with the problems of Modernism - the overscaled commissions of Late- Capitalism, the £50 million quick-built monolith, the symbolic poverty, the mala- propism - it mitigates these problems with an aesthetic sweetener, an anaesthetic some would say. Most clearly this produces the main styles of Late-Modernism: besides the slick-tech façade, there is the extreme articulation of surfaces, the expression of every joint, every different function, every different constructional element. The work of Gerhard Kallmann, a follower of Kahn, and the work of José Luis Sert, a follower of Le Corbusier, shows how dynamic and fractured such articulation can be. For the 'dumb box' of Modernism it substitutes the voluble talking-machine which may tell us more than we want to know: where every room is, where heat circulates and people flow. In Late-Modernism the content often is movement itself: you are always going somewhere, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, but never getting anywhere. In addition the 757</page><page sequence="17">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 2. Philip Johnson &amp;John Burgee, Pennzoil Place, Houston , 19У4-6. A ' simple ' Modern skyscraper is broken in two , distorted , rotated and placed cn edge to create a missing 'third' - typical Late - Modern rhetorical devices that create aesthetic interest hallmarks of this style are a treatment of structure as ornament and overall form as sculptural mass. Whereas Hitchcock and Johnson defined the International Style as an emphasis on volume rather than mass, the structure and skin rather than the heavy masonry wall, we now have once again an emphasis on constructional weight. Pre- eminently it is massive sculpture in rein- forced concrete. The work of I. M. Pei, overvalued often as America's best archi- tecture, characterizes this style of Late- Modernism. Its major competition is the much more light-weight but deeper, work of the New York Five, the revival of Le Corbusier's early period as complicated sculptural form. John Heyduk, Richard Meier and Peter Eisenman take this early Modernism to an extreme as they elaborate axes of rotation and other formal devices such as frontal layering. Finally and most obviously there is the style I have mentioned above, the super- 758 sensual slick-tech style of skyscrapers and other fragmented megabuildings. It is appropriate that this form of Late-Modern- ism has flourished mostly in one centre of Late-Capitalism, Texas, as well as Japan, and produced two of its masterpieces (if we once again avoid embarrassing questions). Philip Johnson's twin towers in Houston, the Pennzoil skywedges, are obvious dis- tortions and exaggerations of Modern skyscrapers : two trapedoidal, minimalist black wedges are placed ten feet apart on edge. The tension created between these two sharp angles is electric, to use a meta- phor prompted by these nodes of mechanical power. From one angle the diagonal cham- fers of the roofs line up to produce a 'double- whole', one building out of two, an inter- pretation which is supported by the left- over triangle of space between the towers (that forms the suggestion of a whole void). More precisely, the space enclosed on two sides is itself a mirror image of the two wedges. Add to these visual illusions the reflective glass and the optical buzz created by the space-frame and one has an aesthetic vertigo that is opposite the stability of Miesian skyscrapers. Where they were harmonious, Johnson's are dissonant, where they repeated a visual element to create order, Johnson multiplies the repetition to create optical vibrations, a shimmering surface and space. Still, the Pennzoil is a simple building (or two) like Modernist ones, but it is a 'complex simplicity' res- ponding to the boring box as Post- Modernists did with another kind of complexity. Complex simplicity, the visual paradox or oxymoron of Late-Modernism, can also be seen in the Hyatt Hotel in Dallas designed in silver reflective glass by Welton Becket Associates. Conceptually it is a simple slab block, but one broken into seven fragments which stagger up and down in profile and turn to the side in plan. This, 'the largest glass sculpture in the World', a necessity for Texas, is still a simple building. It is constructed from the exaggerated repetition of a single element - the square mirror- plate block. Its atrium plan, its bedrooms and corridors are all very familiar, and simple elements are borrowed from other Late-Modern hotels, those of John Portman. It is only in the fracture and juxtaposition, the shimmer and dazzle, that one finds an engaging complexity, and one imagines that the historical overtones, the Art Deco</page><page sequence="18">NOVEMBER I979 AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE Figure 3. Welton Becket Assodatesi Hyatt Regency Hotel, Dallas , 1976-9. ' Complex simplicity ' the oxy moronic device of Late- Modernism created by the elaborate use of simple elements - the module and slab echelons, and the anthropomorphism, the animal image, are unintended. Post-Modernists, by contrast, intend their metaphorical imagery and in the most effective cases tie it to purely architectural meanings. Thus Caesar Pelli and Stanley Tigerman mix body imagery with con- structional expression. The former's 'Blue Whale' is also an 'architectural moulding', the latter's 'Daisy House' is both 'male and female', and these metaphors are mixed with crisply detailed window elements which call attention to themselves as windows. Since I have written on the importance of this mixed and suggested metaphor elsewhere, I might just point out one aspect of the anthropomorphism, usually referred to as empathetic. The argument of Post-Modernists, it is widely shared now, is that we project bodily states into architectural form, finding a corres- pondence between our own structure and that of a building, its façade and our face, its columns and our torso or legs, its decoration and our own (eyebrows, lips and hair to name three ornamental elements)* The empathetic projection may be childish or naïve, as it often is with the popular American bungalow, where these features are exaggerated; or it may be complicated and subliminal, as it is in much classical architecture and the work of Michael Graves. In either case it is a quite natural response, one suppressed by the Modernists (except for Le Corbusier and occasionally Aalto) and one emphasized by the Post- Modernists. The latter focus on it for the quite obvious reason that it is so universal. Since we are so apt to see ourselves in architecture, this projection can be one element in humanizing abstract form and over-scaled housing estates. It is perhaps the most powerful means of gaining the inhabitants' confidence, or engaging the passer-by. An immediate rapport is felt between the inanimate building and our body. Classical architecture recognized this in its exaggeration of columns and mould- ings, in its profusion of caryatids and sculptural figures, while Post-Modernists are investing their own buildings with an equal variety of body images. Many of them are raw and too obvious, denying the truth of the empathetic response that it is most effective when felt and not explicitly seen. But a case can also be made for literal body images, the face house, and so forth. If discreetly used in parts of a building they can cue the inhabitant to the implicit metaphors : the way the 'body of the house', the plan, might 'have its own life,' the way views are 'framed', the way entrances 'welcome' and 'enclose'. Effective body imagery is thus a subtle blending of implicit and explicit metaphor. Several American architects are exploring this anthropomorphism while keeping a residual commitment to Modern archi- tecture. Their work can be seen as transi- tional, as one-half Post-Modern, to split an already split hair. Michael Graves designs esoteric and complicated buildings which have a breadth of architectural reference perhaps best perceived by the architectural historian, although all of his work has some witty and obvious reference. Frank Gehry, with his ad hoc industrial aesthetic, wraps corrugated aluminium boxes around tra- ditional buildings producing a complex and humorous set of juxtapositions. Eugene Küpper, another West-Coast architect, also creates spaces full of ambiguity and surprise. An extensive analysis of any of their recent 759</page><page sequence="19">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 4. Frank Gehry , Architect's House, Santa Monica , 1978. Juxtaposition of old and new in a complex Post-Modern space rich in layering and ambiguity (. Photograph э Charles Jencks) buildings would show the characteristic Post-Modern space: fragmented, rich with symbols, ambiguous, layered with cut-out screens and ordered for an experience of continuous surprise much like an English landscape garden. These aspects should be contrasted with the 'universal space' of Mies and Modernism, but they can only be alluded to in this brief analysis. 760 An important point, which was brought up last week in discussion, concerns the question of pastiche, and it is to this I should like to turn in showing the work of the Post-Modernists. Pastiche has two popular meanings, both of which are rather pejorative: it means a work of art which is a medley of various sources and a work which recalls the style or subject matter of a well-</page><page sequence="20">NOVEMBER I979 AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE Figure 5. Robert Venturi , House for Mother, Chestnut Hill , 196 5. Traditional house forms reinvented at a new scale and crossed with Modernism ( Photography Rollin R. La France ) known author. In short either a hodge- podge or a cliché, or more likely both together, a mish-mash of stereotypes. I mentioned that the work of Robert Adam was sometimes seen in this way and that one man's pastiche is another man's creative interpretation of tradition: e.g. Mozart's re-use of comic opera. For Post-Modernists then, involved with tradition, the distinction between good and bad pastiche is crucial: let us use the positive word reinvention when it is successful. How do we judge this ? Philip Johnson, who has recently spoken in London about his ť twelve twists' on tradition, is an opportune case for treatment. His Dallas Chapel in the form of a spiral ziggurat, one of his twelve thefts from the past, borrows quite directly from the ninth- century minaret at Samarra. It recalls this building explicitly along with the Tower of Babel and a host of other well-known spirals. In fact it recalls other buildings more than it calls out for attention in its own right. Partly this is due to the flat surface and blank detailing, the reduction of the building to an archetype and diagram. The minimal inventiveness - one enters through the lowest wing of the form, and stained glass spirals up to the centre point - is not enough to recharge these shapes with new meaning. They remain past references and very incongruous in Dallas at that. To generalize, a pastiche fails when it recalls a previous building more than it convinces us that its present re-use of form is inventive and suitable. Johnson's more controversial AT &amp; T building is also more convincing. Here he has borrowed from Brunelleschi, Ledoux and the skyscraper architect Raymond Hood - the references are obvious and freely admitted. But they have more relevance in this New York context than the previous ones do in Dallas because they relate to the workings of a skyscraper (with its customary tripartite division) and the New York tradition of these buildings. The AT &amp; T caps the sky with a temple form as skyscrapers did in New York for fifty years, from 1880-1930. Its bottom piers, multi- plied beyond the necessity of structural support, create a sheltered space at street level. This semi-public place may become, with its arcade in the rear, a new form of 761</page><page sequence="21">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER I979 Figure 6. Robert Stern &amp; John Hagmann , Lang House, Washington , Conn., 1974. Ornament used to distort scale , symbolize entry and take one's eyes off the cheap materials (. Photograph , Edmund H. Stoecklein ) transitional urban space, half open and protected. It is hard to judge before com- pletion, but at least it looks in model form like an inventive variation on the atrium and arcade of Portman's work. The side elevation and the gilded statue within are another matter. Here we have a banal revivalism. The statue located on axis, where the altar would be in Brunelleschi's chapel, is a pastiche, the Winged Goddess of AT &amp; T as it were. This is the kind of devaluation of symbols which Siegfried Giedion attacked and which the Modern Movement was invented in order to stop. Robert Venturi, among the Post- Modernists, has been most articulate in his re-use of symbols and the problems this creates. Much of his work plays with pastiche, but in a more knowing way than Johnson. He is careful to use a traditional motif, a cliché, so that it both communicates conventionally and differently. This has the obvious advantage over Modernism which eschewed conventional symbolism 762 and straight revivalism which fell into stereotype, both of which failed to com- municate effectively with the users of buildings for exactly opposite reasons. Venturi has steered a middle course, not always successfully, between these extremes of non-communication. In his house for his mother (another one of these Post-Modern commissions) he has used applied ornament and traditional house forms in a symbolic way. For instance the exterior shows a Palladian symmetry and various other signs of homestead : the pitched roof, the off-centre chimney and gable. With these essential stereotypes of the house he has produced unstereotypical variation. Some windows are exaggerated in size, the top floor lunette, to increase the scale. An exterior dado, or string course, bisects windows to also increase the size of the small building and make it more formal. Further decoration is applied to signify the public entrance, or front door, but it consists of a 'false arch', a broken slat of</page><page sequence="22">NOVEMBER I979 AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE Figure 7. Charles Moore , Perez Associates &amp; Uig3 Piazza D'Italia, New Orleans , plan , 1976. Baroque town planning and fountain are recalled by these forms as well as specific , local meanings: the Sicilian community (as represented by map), the black and white bands of the existing skyscraper , etc. wood which also has a signifying function: to indicate further distortions in conventional usage. One enters not straight ahead under the arch, but at right angles to it. The shifted axis, signalled by a curve to one side, has since become a conventional device for Post-Modernists . Two followers of Venturi, Robert Stern and Thomas Gordon Smith, an architect still in his twenties, have developed the same complicated spatial motifs, use of historical styles and applied ornament. Stern uses decorative mouldings in a Venturian way to bisect the windows, in- crease the scale and symbolize important areas such as the front door. He adds to these functions an older one, the rôle of ornament to symbolize well-being, to ťhide a fault in construction', to take the eyes off an otherwise cheap and ugly façade. The question of ugliness, previously raised in the nineteenth century as a sometimes positive contribution, has once again been formulated by Venturi and Stern. Their buildings are often calculatedly awkward. This can result from an attempt at 'inclusivism', trying to include and show as much different content as possible, the contradictions of functional requirements, even the different tastes of the users; in short ugliness may be a by- product of a straightforward approach to a pluralistic society. Or, more questionably, it may be a simple reaction against the too- facile beauty of Modernism, the policy to which they contrast their own, the cex- clusivism' of Mies. There is a reactive tinge within some Post-Modernism which makes it more complicated and awkward than it has to be, even according to 'inclusivism and the difficult whole'. Against this trend the quite powerful work of Thomas Gordon Smith is refreshing. Using very strong colours, part of the San Francisco tradition, and an eclectic mix of fragments - Michelangelo, 763</page><page sequence="23">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Dientzenhofer, Baroque, Modern, Ver- nacular - he manages to incorporate this diversity with elegance and strength. We see in these Post-Modernists an implicit trend towards incorporating more and more styles from the past. In the early sixties this eclecticism was hesitant and embarrassed, the first tentative steps into a previously prohibited area. To-day the re-use of historical motifs is frank and confident, we have achieved a more easy-going relation to our traditions and the stage is being set for eclecticism itself. The question is no longer whether to use any and all styles, but how to use them with conviction, and this must depend in part on a philosophy. As I mentioned last week there are three obvious justifications for choosing a style, or mixing them as the case may be : the context of the building, the character of the functions and the taste-culture of the users. We can see these three aspects in Charles Moore's half-completed Piazza d'Italia, New Orleans, an example of Radical Eclecticism worth analysing in depth. As the aerial view of the urban context reveals, this piazza is set in a mixed area of New Orleans. To one side is a Modern skyscraper, the black and white graphics of which have been taken up as a motif to generate a graduating circle of rings. This circular form, at once a Modern 'bull's- eye' and Baroque urban form (Place des Victoires, Paris), permeates out into three streets giving a cue to the passer-by that something unusual occurs behind the existing buildings. This setting up of an expectation, and the use of veiling devices that at once proclaim and hide - the arch- way, the pergola - dramatize the approach. We are pulled towards the centre of the bull's-eye and expect to find there a sym- metrical, circular culmination. What actu- ally occurs both satisfies and contradicts this supposition. There are indeed a centre and circular forms, but instead of their confirming a Baroque centrality, they set up certain new expectancies. The circles are partial discs, screens of columns, that spin asymmetrically on the diagonal of movement towards a new culmination point, the tallest form, an archway, in fact a Modern S er liana. This diagonal is reinforced by the cascade of broken forms - 'the boot of Italy' - which focuses on the highest plateau, the 'Italian Alps'. Thus we have a clear organiza- tion of form and content. As Italy rises towards the Northern Alps, so too do the 764 NOVEMBER 1979 Five Orders of Italian columns, and they culminate in a new, Sixth Order, which enframes the future restaurant. This in- vention for a German Restaurant (they will hang sausages in the windows) Moore calls the 'Deli Order'. Neon necklaces around the neck of these columns further indicate that this is the twentieth century, and the fact that commercial 'bad taste' is a very big part of it. Moore is quite committed to architectural whimsy, terrible jokes and bad building puns (he calls his watering metopes 'wetopes') ; and it is a credit to his teamwork that these calculated lapses in judgement do not get the upper hand. They are part of a rich mix of meanings rather the way similar elements are absorbed into Shakespearean drama. A point worth stressing is that the plurality of meanings in this scheme could not have been invented by one designer. Moore has teamed up with two local architects from the firm of Perez and Associates and these designers supplied much of the peculiar cultural knowledge. They were the ones to stress the importance of the annual St. Joseph's festival, the pretext for the fountain and piazza. Once a year the Italian com- munity comes to the fore to celebrate its presence, and they do so by selling Italian specialities and local concoctions (muffalat- tas, salami, cheese, etc.) on the day of their patron saint. Since the ostensible reason for the piazza was to give identity to the Italian community, in a city where other ethnic groups dominate (the French, the Spanish, the blacks and Anglos), there was an opportunity for historicist rhetoric. There was important social content ready to be symbolized if the designer knew what to symbolize and had the courage and rhetorical skill to carry it through. (We should note in passing that Modernists and Late- Modernists end up signifying technique, construction, movement, because they have no great interest or belief in social content.) So what was the content ? 'Italianess' clearly, as symbolized by the echoes of the Trevi fountain, the Five rather than Three Orders, the strong earth colouring, the Latin in- scription ('This fountain was given by the citizens of New Orleans as a gift to all the people') and above all the plan of Italy (with the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas and rivers represented by moving water). Since the community is made up mostly of Sicilians this island occupies the centre of the bull's-eye and becomes also another</page><page sequence="24">NOVEMBER I979 AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE Figure 8.

It also rises in black and white granite and slate and turns into a speaker's rostrum from which the mayor can address an audience on St. Joseph's day. This peculiar conceit, like the idea of setting up an area for selling food (the Italian community use wagons on tracks for this) is the kind of detailed social content that emerges only after patient inquiry into a local culture. These particular functions give the rhetorical forms a credi- bility they would otherwise lack. Indeed some Modern architects have perceived this work as pure pastiche, partly, I think, because they have not visited the piazza and seen the rationale for each form. These rationales exist, once again, on many levels. To return to the urban context we can see how the piazza (void) not only provides a contrast to the rehabilitated fabric (solid) but becomes another New Orleans centre in contrast to the eighteenth-century French square a mile to the East. Basically we have a mixed urban type here: a more or less solid poché of infill space, warehouses and offices which is carved out by the discs- screens and, to one side, by a pie-segment of brick and granite. A sliver of this pie is framed by a pergola-temple, of concrete columns and open pipe-work, which is skewed in plan to conform to the pie-shape. The proportions and details of this 'temple' are at once ancient and modern, classically scaled and more slender than the marble prototypes. This, the major gateway, carries the name Piazza D'Italia in a straight- forward way. It is balanced asymmetrically by the twenty-two storey tower to one side and a 'campanile' on the corner, to the other. Thus again there is a pleasant mixture of old and new meanings, symmetrical Baroque and asymmetrical Modern, enclosed and open, low and high. This is a plural archi- tecture that tries to include everything. I For historians there are references to the 765</page><page sequence="25">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Marine Theatre of Hadrian and the triumphal gateways of Schinkel; for the Sicilians there are references to archetypal piazzas and fountains; for the Modernists there is an acknowledgement of skyscrapers and the use of current technologies (the neon and concrete); for the lover of pure architectural form there are cutaway imposts finished in speckled marble and a most sensuous use of polished stainless steel. Column capitals glisten with this material as water shoots out of the acanthus leaves; or the stern, squat Tuscan columns are cut from this material, leaving razor-sharp, 'paramilitary' images, the silhouettes of Greek helmets.1 The overall impression finally is a sensuous and rhetorical one every bit as mixed and rich as the Trevi fountain, another example of architecture, sculpture, writing, fountain, landscape and urban form. We see, to conclude, that the Piazza is a successful example of Radical Eclecticism; it fits into and extends the urban context, it characterizes the various functions, symbolic and practical, with various styles, and it NOVEMBER 1979 takes its cues for content and form from the local taste-culture, the Italian community. Moreover it provides this community with a centre, a location, a 'heart', to quote again the Post-Modern catchword. On the question of pastiche it gives a firm answer: if you borrow from the bank of architecture, especially in this time of inflation, you have to repay the loan with interest; that is, re-invent previous meanings while also using them conventionally. Finally, and on a predictive note, it shows that we may be in for an exciting period of architecture like the Baroque, when different arts combine together to produce a rhetorical whole. Clearly the sucess of this rhetoric depends on an area outside of architecture : the belief in a social or metaphysical content. Other- wise the energy necessary to bring the arts together will not be expended and the images will lack conviction - be in fact pasticcio. REFERENCE i. Several of these meanings were pointed out to me by Charles Moore in a discussion, March 1979; others can be found in Martin Filler's excellent article on the Piazza in Progressive Architecture , Nov. 1978, pp. 81-7. DISCUSSION Mr. Nathan Silver (Head Department of Architecture, North East London Polytechnic) : I would question the importance that Dr. Jencks places on the New Orleans work of Charles Moore. It reminds me of Portmeirion, but Port- meirion had a very different audience. It has a certain coarseness that I find disturbing. Perhaps it has something to do with the scale, or the breadth of the audience. Whereas in a college one has a particular kind of audience, and the message can be clear and the echoes can be dependable, when you have an open space in a town (and I have not been to New Orleans, so I stand to be corrected) it seems to me that you are asking all sorts of people in and you are acquiring kinds of responses that are actually much more random than the ones that that tries to set up. In other words, I think that it is aiming too low. The Lecturer: I think one man's pastiche, or coarseness, in your terms, is another man's reinvention or sublety. In a sense one has to ask, whose taste it is, and whom are we calling coarse ? As I tried to point out, the building has very delicate, subtle meanings in its architecture which are only fully appreciated by the architect. I mean the kind of subleties, the spatial handling for instance, the delicacy of related earth colours, which are wonderful and which may not come across in slides. What may come across in slides are these very strong colours, strong forms and overpowering imagery. It uses stereotypes, no 766 doubt, and - again to return to the touchstone of mixed language, to return to Shakespeare - it uses many different langugages, many of which are vulgar. I think one of our difficulties to-day is to be able to see through vulgarity to the interesting things which are happening behind it. Mr. Silver: There is a difference between vulgarity and coarseness. I think vulgarity (which is something with the common touch) is what Moore aimed at, and coarseness is what he achieved. Mr. Robert Byng : I have not seen the Piazza d'Italia, but I have seen Kresge College. From the photographs of the Piazza d'Italia I am not at all sure that one need take it so seriously. If you look at it as a mixture of Coney Island and Piccadilly Circus, one can enjoy it as a pleasant joke and shrug one's shoulders. What worries me far more where Kresge College is concerned is the sheer ephemeral quality, the fact that it is paper thin, theatrical, and you feel that at any moment somebody could press a button and one façade would go up into the sky and another façade would come down. An interesting fact about Kresge College is that it is in fact stucco on timber, slick and very self-conscious. Basically, Italian hill towns are not self- conscious. They come from a long history of development that is partly accidental and also they are very much in the round. In Kresge you go around the back and behind the inch of stucco</page><page sequence="26">NOVEMBER 1979 you are in brown-painted timber boards. A number of students are in residence for, say, three years and for periods of a semester of nine, ten, or twelve weeks. Is the feeling of living in a stage set right for a university ? The Lecturer: I agree with you to a certain extent on both aspects of that question. Perhaps I invest the Piazza d'Italia with too much importance, for want of a better example to illustrate Radical Eclecticism. Fountains are fountains, even fountains to the Italian com- munity, even to the notion of Italianness in it. One has to remember of course that the Modern Movement in the late fifties and early sixties set itself a notion of 'identity and place', an ethnic identity, but was not able to bring it off. And here at least 'Italianness' is being effectively communicated. As I mentioned at the end of the lecture our problem is to find a credible 'content' to build for and represent. In a society which puts its money behind sky- scrapers or restaurants or the equivalent, the content tends to make any form of expression not very credible; and so in this scheme I felt that at least there was a credible programme and brief, and that the architects could justify their mixture of different rhetorical forms. I would admit that Kresge College is in- substantial and suffers from being stucco over wood. It is part of the 'cheapskate aesthetic' that I mentioned as our inheritance from the Modern Movement, which, in its negative aspects, has been attacked by the students who live there as 'clown town'. It is a stage set. This is where we have very realistic social trade-offs, and if you look at that scheme against any other housing for students and any other community dormitory, and against so many British universities, I would just ask you which you would rather live in. On that level it does have the faults, but those faults are part of the faults of our society. There is another aspect of the theatricalness in that stage sets are in a California context. California student life is one of the great living theatres of American life. So there is a kind of appropriateness, of which Moore is aware in his ironic use of those motifs and the 'seven monuments'. Indeed if you go into the indivi- dual rooms you find the same mixture. He turns the bathroom into the 'heart' and makes an open bathroom on a gigantic scale with all sorts of make-up mirrors and lights - the cliché of a Hollywood make-up dressing room - because he has found in his market research that Americans, students, like to spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Mr. H. J. Louw (Lecturer, School of Architecture, University of Newcastle-upon- Tyne) : I was very interested in the remark that you made towards the end of your talk, namely, that we seem to be leading towards a Baroque AMERICA'S NEW ARCHITECTURAL CULTURE phase in modern architecture, I have come to very much the same conclusion but one problem which bothers me is that the Baroque style developed from a very strong spiritual base, provided on the one hand by the Counter Reformation Church and on the other by the totalitarian state. Only because of these two conditions could the style really develop in the way that it did. Now, it seems to me that our present-day society is lacking exactly those spiritual qualities which made the Baroque possible. What is your comment on that ? The Lecturer : A cynic would say that we do like the totalitarian state, but clearly in the context we are talking about that is not going to be an acceptable content for some kind of mixture of the arts and rhetoric. Last week I showed the Japanese architects who were designing these very strange houses around their own Japanese and modern meta- physics. To-day I showed a little bit of that too in that some of the private houses develop a private content which is really between the architect and the client. What I would say is that in general architecture has to have a metaphysic behind it, it has to operate within a metaphysic. In an age when our metaphysics is first of all plural in the sense that none can agree, or not many groups can agree, on what is an overriding goal, architecture is cast in doubt. But that is not to say that architecture has to stop. Many people talk about the death of architecture because of that; I do not believe that is possible. Secondly I do not believe that because the Baroque age had a strong metaphysic and a strong social philosophy, that means that we cannot choose to use a richer language of architecture, even though lacking a richer social and political philosophy. Mr. Louw: If I can use the historical analogy again, with sixteenth-century Italy, the proto-Baroque or Mannerist period, which seems to have had the same kind of doubts and plualism characteristic of our age. Would that be a valid comparison with the situation as it exists at present ? The Lecturer: Well, many people have compared the age we are going through now to Mannerism. The Chairman : May I remind you that Charles Jencks' next lecture will be on 'Euro- pean Urbanism and Historicism', and those of you may have found all that multi-coloured candy floss shown this evening too consumptive will be interested in the different kind of historic- ism which has emerged in Europe in the last few years - which has a much stronger moral to it. I now ask you to join with me in thanking Charles Jencks. The meeting closed with acclamation . 767</page><page sequence="27">III. EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM delivered on Monday 4th June 1979 , with James Stirling , Chairman , James Stirling &amp; Partner , ш г/zč Chair The Chairman briefly introduced the Lecturer , who then proceeded as follows: T1HE have culture spoken explosion of Japan about and in has America the its architectural counterpart which I culture of Japan and America which I have spoken about has its counterpart in Europe although, as one would expect, the metaphor of cultural explosion, a sudden burst of creative energy, has to be modified to suit the prevailing conditions - mental and economic. Europe also has had its chain reaction but this has resulted, not in the buildings of America and Japan, but in a megaton of writings: books, articles, mani- festoes and exhibitions - instead of archi- tecture. The written word, the drawn project have, intentionally or not, dominated over the constructed artefact. These writings are largely concerned with the city - U Archi- tettura della Città (Aldo Rossi), Delirious New York (Rem Koolhaas), Collage City (Colin Rowe) - or with rediscovering a European tradition, Architettura razionale (Rossi again), Rational Architecture (Leon Krier), La Tendenza (French, Italian and Swiss magazines), or with both together, thus giving birth to my hybrid title 'Euro- pean Urbanism and Historicism'. While completed buildings remain few and somewhat unconvincing, we should not underestimate the effect of architectural publication. Vitruvius, Alberti, Serlio, Viollet-le-Duc, all marginal builders, need only be recalled to illustrate the truth that present writing creates architecture just as much as current building practice. And it is my contention that we are living through a renaissance of architectural thinking , a re- birth in theory that awaits expectantly, and longingly, for a corresponding rebirth in practice. It is a re-naissance not of classical antiquity, but of architectural history in its variety; not of one tradition, but many heterogeneous ones, displaced from their previous contexts. Paradoxically the content of this architecture, the problem for an agnostic age, is the repository of architectural form. We fill up the empty centre of the city, the place previously occupied by the church and palace, with the recapitulation of many cultures - that is the museum, 768 'the museum city', or its political equivalent, the democratic forum and public realm, where a plurality of cultures contend. These are the new icons of architecture, part fantasy and part very real institutions : the city as a collection of artistic fragments and contentious subcultures. In sketching out this 'renaissance of the Renaissance' and other traditions, I will once again, and predictably, show the gradual development from Late to Post- Modern architecture, from the first, tenta- tive modifications of Modernism to its more radical transformation. The first steps took place in Italy and Germany with the extreme and even terrifying projects of Aldo Rossi, Mathias Ungers and a group called Super- studio. On the one hand, and in a very Modernist way, they revived the primitive Rationalism of Abbé Laugier, the notion that architecture could and must be reduced to certain fundamentals. Hence their con- stant invocation of Laugier's Primitive Hut and its lesson that architecture lies in the column, the colonnade and the triangular truss, that is structural universais and necessities. Of course these universais were invoked by Le Corbusier and the Modernists, along with their attendant qualities of simplicity and nobility. These combined virtues, always present in Laugier's engraving, were presumed to exist in the simple constructions of the Noble Savage, that bare-foot architect who sup- posedly kept as close to the 'needs' of the people as the 'rawness' of nature. That no bare-foot architect can exist in an industrial society does not make him any the less attractive as a fiction, and it is as a fiction that his presence looms large in the work of the present Rationalists. Aldo Rossi calls forth his virtues in large, anonymous housing schemes that repeat the simple structural support more than is structurally necessary. Leon Krier actually promotes a building industry which has returned to rustic huts and a craftsmanship that cele- brates knotted logs, a kind of log-cabinism</page><page sequence="28">NOVEMBER I979 EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM Figure i.

Photograph , Oppositions, 3) built on the scale of the Crystal Palace. The contradictions are disarming and, taken at face value, absurd. Krier, a Marxist, supports the Classical revivalism of Quinlan Terry, the architect of Palladian country houses. Or Aldo Rossi and the Italian members of Superstudio, also Marxists, support the Fascist architecture of the thirties, including the work of Stalin. We shall see such incongruous contradictions throughout this talk and although much can be said against them, I shall confine my remarks to the positive anomalies to which they give rebirth. 1 Aldo Rossi was instrumental in turning architects' attention back to city mor- phology and the way the city and its monuments form a collective memory. Street, arcade, piazza, monument - these traditional elements reappeared in his work along with 'the constant elements of architecture : the column, the architrave, the wall, the roof', that is Laugier's elements. Their reappearance was transformed by the new technologies - basically white planar reinforced concrete - and Rossi's particular, indeed peculiar, fascination with Lombardy farmhouses, barns and anonymous structures. So, although memory of the traditional city was invoked, it was subtly displaced towards a primitive Modernism. Rossi's Gallaratese neighbourhood is a case in point. For him it recalls Italian arcades and the traditional street, whereas for the working-class community it may recall mass housing and the Fascist stripped classicism of the thirties. Rossi's mis- apprehension of popular codes of archi- tecture mark him as a Late-Modernist, whereas his theory of city memory has contributed to the Post-Modern notion of the contextual city. All of his buildings approach the condition of the grave and the monument; his most influential scheme, the Modena cemetery, 1971, was in fact both a giant mausoleum and urban land- mark. Laid out as a series of primary elements organized on a grid, adopting an axial approach which focused on 'the house of the dead' and a stark cone-shaped funnel, it gave an ultimate image to death. Black shadows replaced windows, a striking image of the burnt-out ruin: empty piazzas with long shadows evoked the silent urban spaces 769</page><page sequence="29">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 2. Ricardo Bofill &amp; Taler , Waiden 7, Barcelona , 1973-5 . Traditional elements ( balconies , íí/č, courtyards) are used at a gigantic , Surrational scale. and metaphysical loneliness of de Chirico paintings. The finality of these images might be appropriate to death, although one could argue that even in a cemetery life and variety should be celebrated. In any case all Rossi's building seems like an il- lustration of Adolf Loos' statement that architecture resides in the monument and grave, and they depend for their power on the striking incongruity of evoking images of death for life. Since Modernism was ostensibly anti- monumental in the twenties, the work of Rossi and his followers has sought to rectify this failing by turning Modernist housing 770 schemes into monuments. Giorgio Grassi and others have designed housing blocks as long arcaded streetscapes. Again the orna- ment, such as it is, consists in the play of solid and void, white pier and black shadow, and the looming emptiness of de Chirico is recalled. Their scheme, for student housing, 1976, is reduced to Rationalist fundamentals: street, arcade, balcony and window. If one compares it to Weinbrenner's streetscape for Karlsruhe, 1808, the obvious prototype, then its relative austerity becomes more pronounced. Where Weinbrenner allowed himself minimal ornament, a cornice, podium, dentil frieze and string</page><page sequence="30">NOVEMBER I979 course. Grassi has allowed himself nothing except balconies and mullions. This makes his architecture, like Rossi's, reminiscent of the prison and death camp, unintended meanings which he might deny. It also resembles, again, Fascist architecture equally abhorrent to the authors on a political level. The argument in favour of this architectural language, apart from its powerful imagery, rests on the idea that these forms can be resemanticized with new usage. That prisons, concentration camps and Fascists made use of stripped Neo-Classical forms does not contaminate their meaning forever; in fact the Rationalist programme is to resemanticize these 'universal' forms by tying them to new socialist housing schemes, and new functional types of the city. Leon Krier, in his book Rational Architecture , 1978, illustrates these schemes with a dogmatic pronouncement, empha- sized in capital letters, on how the language of types is supposed to work. The street and the square represent the only and necessary model for the reconstruction of a PUBLIC REALM. In this context, we also stress the necessary dialectical relationship of BUILDING TYPOLOGY and MORPHOL- OGY OF URBAN SPACE and inside that dialectic, THE CORRECT RELATIONSHIP OF MONUMENTS (public buildings) AND THE MORE ANONYMOUS URBAN FABRIC (buildings for private use).2 So the street and square along with primary building forms and a chosen urban morphology are meant to re-establish urban identity. The ideas are exemplary although they hardly go far enough (since the form remains abstract, not cultural or local). And since many people continue to perceive the work of the Rationalists as Fascist, because of its style, one would have thought minor modifications in the language, such as ornament, might have been introduced to change the message. Yet the Rationalists, unlike the American and Japanese designers, have been loath to take this next step. Although they will revive many classical antecedents - Palladio, Ledoux, Schinkel are the favoured three- they will not yet revive their system of ornament because they regard it as kitsch, or as contrary to constructional reality. One presumes this contradiction will not last and that in the next few years the Rationalists will accept their whole patrimony, not just the funda- mentalist part. By 1975 the Rationalist movement had EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM spread across Europe and there were major centres in Berlin, Paris, Milan, Venice, Rome, Brussels and Barcelona, centres which kept in touch with each other through publications, lectures and exhibits. One exhibition in Barcelona was called, I believe, '21 Followers of Aldo Rossi', while Leon Krier and his students who redesigned the morphology of this city, were given a major showing in 1978. Local Barcelona architects, in any case, had been practising by name a form of rational architecture since the late fifties and this work culminated in the Surrationalism of Bofill's extraordinary schemes. Giant housing blocks, called Xanadu or Waiden 7 were lifted out of a city context and stuck like surrealist objets trouvés in a stark, rocky landscape. The simplicity, and organizational logic were both rational, while the image and scale were surreal: hence my term surrational for this compound of reason and madness. Indeed the strength of much Rationalist work depends precisely on this mixture, and the semantic contradictions mentioned above are just one more powerful instance of it. The most convincing examples of surrationalism, besides Bofill's architecture, are the projects of ОМА, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. For instance Elia Zenghelis' Hotel Sphinx, 1975, mixes several urban types with the barely visible image of an animal, perhaps a sphinx. The legs are escalators, the tails are twin towers, the head that 'turns and stares' at important civic events is a health club, the whole animal is a 'luxury hotel designed as a model for mass housing'. This might be any one of the thirty Hyatt Hotels springing up across America except that it is considerably more colourful and witty. In its mixture of real urban functions and existing urban fantasies it summarizes the tendencies towards sur- rationalism both on the commercial and artistic planes. Like other anthropomorphic buildings it animates potentially over- powering large-scale form. Rem Koolhaas, perhaps the ultimate surrationalist with his book and designs on Delirious New York , shows the poetry behind the mixture of logic and commercial dreams. His rational fantasies consist in taking artificiality and urban congestion to an extreme ; continuing thereby the tradition of Rockefeller Centre and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. There is a side to European urbanism which is not surrational ; the same designers have their practical side which treats city 771</page><page sequence="31">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 3.

An attempt to bring anthropomorphism and a variety of functions back to the skyscraper problems in a very realistic way, as a problem in morphology. During the early sixties many architects started looking at Hadrian's Villa and its complex plan for its morpho- logical implications. What they found of interest was the mixture of geometric form and accident, formal set-piece and inform- ality, axial planning and the picturesque, foreground and background, monument and infill - in short the set of dualities which later were to be summarized and turned into a theory of Collage City and a book of that name by Colin Rowe. The idea of collage city was dualism itself, an incorpor- ation of opposite qualities which Modern city planning in its Utopian, or totalistic phase, had denied. Thus there was a place for Utopian, or 'ideal' urban form, in frag- 772 ments set within a background of private buildings, or urban poché. Besides Hadrian's Villa, the Nolli plan of Rome, 1748, was a model of such urban morphology. As Rowe pointed out, the collage technique had the further advantage of 'permitting us the enjoyment of Utopian poetics without our being obliged to suffer the embarrassment of Utopian polities'. That is, it could incorporate 'vest-pocket utopias - Swiss canton, New England village, Dome of the Rock, Place Vendôme, Campidoglio, the set-pieces of totalistic ideologies, without having to put up with their inherent totalitarianism'.3 The resul- tant morphology could best be represented in figure- ground city maps which showed, like Nolli's plan, a relation of private to</page><page sequence="32">NOVEMBER I979 EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM Figure 4. Mathias Ungers et aï., Student Hostel Competition, Berlin , 196 5, treats the city as a collage of fragmented 'ideal' forms , notably the circle set against the rectangle public which was roughly four to one. Modern planning, on the other hand, set monuments in a park, or more likely, in a parking lot, so that the fabric was destroyed and the set-piece had nothing with which to contrast. Mathias Ungers, James Stirling and then the Krier brothers took up these morpho- logical ideas and applied them to existing cities, especially the parts that had been destroyed by Modern planning. In addition to their characteristic figure/ground draw- ings and rich collage of primary, 'utopian' shapes there was a recurring leitmotif which almost became the trade mark of the Rationalists; this was, most basically, the circle set against the square. This primary opposition, adopted from the Mandala as much as Hadrianic archi- tecture, was used to carve out a positive urban void from a conceptually solid block of urban tissue - foreground curve against background square. One finds the opposition in Unger's Student Hostel Competition of 773</page><page sequence="33">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 5. Leon Krier s Triangular Civic Building, for St. Peter's Square , 1978. Piranesian in scale and in the grand Roman tradition , this ' primitive huť shelters a new form of social organization. ( Photograph , Architectural Review) 1963, in Stirling and Kriers' Derby Civic Centre of 1970, in Charles Moore's Piazza d'Italia 1975 and in many of the recent Stirling schemes for German cities. The circular form often takes the function of a pedestrian route under a glass-covered arcade, rather like a curved galleria. This revival of the nineteenth- century arcade in a new form is itself a devastating critique of recent development which has seen the destruction of so many of these pleasant urban places. The curved galleria has a potential in providing strong sense of place. It encloses or envelops, womb-like, a piazza to one side, the favoured res publica of the Rationalists, while on its inside it provides a certain degree of expectation to a walk through the city. The eye and mind are continually pulled around the corner. The centre of the circle, or more often semi- circle, is felt as the 'heart' of the city, again 774 a favourite theme of Post-Modernists. But it is the opposition of circle to square, feminine to masculine, which gives com- municational weight to this pattern and a universality it would otherwise lack. The Krier brothers have revived, or 'recuperated' as they say in Europe, almost all such urban forms thrown out by the Modern Movement. Robert Krier has made countless morphological studies of existing historic cities to show the importance of crescents, arcades, streets and squares and it is these 'universais' he not surprisingly uses to stitch together disrupted fabric. In a series of before and after drawings, like those of Humphry Repton, he shows what particular advantage can be had by re- inventing and then adding the old elements to a destroyed 'centre', such as that of Stuttgart. Other Rationalists fill up the empty spaces in modern cities of Oscar</page><page sequence="34">NOVEMBER I979 Niemeyer and Le Corbusier, doubling the density, increasing the 'culture of congestion' as Rem Koolhaas has termed it. Leon Krier, in an extraordinary outburst of city drawing reminiscent of Le Corbusier's unsolicited plans, has provided urban icons which are meant to stimulate political action. He has drawn seductive aerial views of London, Echternach, Rome, Bremen, Barcelona and Luxembourg which con- cerned citizens are meant to use against those who would continue Modern, com- prehensive redevelopment. These views, like eighteenth- century tourist maps, be- come critical tools, aide-memoires , icons, and finally 'counter-schemes' to stop that insidious marriage between speculators and Modernists. No urban authority has yet intervened to commission a Krier 'mend- and-modify job', just as no authority commissioned Le Corbusier for forty years, but his influence has nonetheless been effective and, like that of ARAU, a Brussels group, enough to deflect some of the more destructive plans. His most poetic intervention in terms of imagery is his modification of the 1748 Nolli plan of Rome, an intervention sup- ported by the mayor Carlo Argan in an exhibition Roma Interrotta , 1978, an exhibi- tion of twelve architects' proposals for the city. Krier has, Laugier-like, reinvented the primitive hut of columns and triangular roof trusses, but this time each column is the size of an eight-storey tower and the pyramidal roof encloses an awesome public realm - a cross between a train-shed and an open-air market. The drawings when seen collaged into the Roman perspectives of Piranesi actually stand up to these grand and disturbing images. The buildings have the breadth of scale and the heavy gestural quality typical of the Roman tradition. They consist of three basic types: the square, semi-circular and triangular shed inserted respectively into the 'centre' of Rome, the end of Piazza Navona and the open end of St. Peter's, a triangular wedge thrusting towards the church (actually a rather 'Modern' completion when compared with those offered since 1660). The triangular shed, like the others, is a new social centre meant to revive and support a local form of civic organization, the rione , an alternative to the centralized bureaucracy, church and municipio. It would have restaurants, clubs, rooms for games and large top floor studios for artists. These craftsmen of the new EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM grass-roots democracy would 'work on the adornment of their rione. Their creative work will naturally spread (in final stages of elaboration) into the square, and for short periods these spaces will be filled with some vast fresco or sculpture before they are taken to their location'.4 Here we have then a typical 'vest-pocket utopia' a form of syndicalist and local organization being collaged into the existing fabric, both formally and politically. The idea, as Krier makes clear, is to revive the res publica and create new civic institutions which can support it, ones on a par with the seventeenth-century churches of Rome, which would be, ironically, converted back into Thermae. If this social idealism is both realistic, 'embarrassing' (as Rowe would term it) and unrealized, the Rationalists have nevertheless built small, imperfect versions of their white, Utopian dreams. Georgia Benamo and Christian de Port- zamparc have completed a small urban scheme on the edge of Paris, the Rue des Hautes-Formes, 1975-9. This inevitably seeks to create 'the street, the square, the urban place' with that density or congestion beloved by the Rationalists. Tower and slab blocks of Modernism are combined and given a Post-Modern formal treatment of cut-out screens à la Moore, false hanging arches to signify entry à la Venturi, and a variety of window treatment à la mode. The last is further justified to 'keep a thousand windows from watching you', the many eyes of the scheme from seeming op- pressively large and homogenous (three types of window are used behind a screen wall). If there are Rationalist doubts they concern the leaky space, the small size of the piazza and res publica , and the rather neutralized relation of solid to void, urban poché to monument (the scheme lacks monuments). Still we have here an idea and summary of Rationalism in its Late- Modern Phase just as it is coming to grips with the problems of communication, of signification based on traditional and local codes. The next stage of European urbanism overlaps temporally with the previous one, but is more explicit in its attempt to deal with local understanding or the way archi- tecture is a language that must be decoded, however imperfectly, by those who use it. In short these are the Post-Modern archi- tects, or else the same Rationalists we have looked at in their new-found interest in 775</page><page sequence="35">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS architectural communication. Again the ideas of Colin Rowe are relevant, for their dualism contains the binary logic which is essential to all communication systems. Urban form is significant partly because it consists in a series of contiguous opposites, an obvious truth which perhaps only needs statement at a time when the environment has become too homogeneous. During the last few years many architects and theorists have attacked excessive homo- geneity with countervailing strategies which they have termed variously townscape philosophy, adhocism , bricolage, collision city, and the new empiricism. These philoso- phies are counter to both Modernism and Rationalism because of their exaggerated emphasis on geometric order and repetition. By contrast the new consciousness favours the Picturesque and inevitably makes use of ideas from this tradition among which are, notably, variety, surprise and contrast. If there is an addition to this triad it concerns the notion of the interest-group, or the idea that any city contains many sub- cultures which have opposed interests. The Urbanist's rôle is to design fragments of the city which reflect the culture and ideals of these groups while contrasting them with other orders - pragmatic or architectural. Perhaps this strategy was only articulated by Advocacy planners and a few politically inclined architects, but it was implicitly shared by many designers who favoured participation and consultation in design. The architectural results were especially hybrid. In Amsterdam, Zwolle and Dutch cities, interest groups formed with archi- tects to produce a hybrid Modern/ Traditional urban infill, the tall thin brick houses of the traditional city with several modifications. These included flat- top gables (Modernist signs), large bay windows, internal courtyards, double-height spaces and garden extensions; otherwise the morphology was the traditional urban pattern of street and square, and the language deferred to the local vernacular. At its most tepid this tendency became the Neo- Vernacular, that mix of regional style and modern amenity which was unassertive and accommodating in the extreme. More aggressively it became the adhocism of Ralph Erskine and Lucien Kroll, a dramatic juxtaposition of styles and ideologies more pluralistic in its variety. The buildings of these two architects and their extended design teams were created in continual 776 NOVEMBER 1979 consultation with the ultimate inhabitants. More purely architectural in intention, but still locally based, were urban schemes of James Stirling, Jeremy Dixon and a Viennese group known as Missing Link (they seek to become a link with the past of their city). Stirling proposed an ad hoc attachment to an open space in Berlin which had been partly created by modern planners and the aerial bombardment of a huge parking garage. On to this desolate structure Stirling attached a thin city fabric of shops and urban tissue. He took the scale and picturesque variety of the remaining Berlin houses and manipulated the form so that it underwent a musical development, a type of sonata-allegro organization. Reading from left to right down the street and around the corner, one could see an ana- logous pattern of 'introduction, exposition, development, recapitualation and coda'.5 Bay windows, doorways and roof exit became the musical themes which were transformed in each section. Because Stirling is more committed to architecture than the other designers playing on a local ver- nacular his schemes are more highly ordered and syncopated than the others. There is one London version of this urban architecture nearing completion, the infill housing of Jeremy Dixon in the Notting Hill Gate area. Like the Neo Vernacular Dutch examples this is a traditional brick type, even having a Dutch gable and crow- step articulation. Like nineteenth-century Queen Anne Revival, the English style is allowed to be electically foreign while it is still British. Other historicist quotes include Art Deco ziggurats and Rationalist grids, but it is the local contextualism which is most relevant. Accepting the street lines and the traditional layout (except for un- fortunate diagonals in plan), accepting the bay windows of the adjoining houses and their emphasis on stairway, door and front step, the scheme manages to be both ac- ceptably familiar and inventive. The in- habitants can recognize their traditional language and requirements; the stereotypes are used in a relatively straightforward way, as stock as the London brick. But then, on further inspection and in a more esoteric code, are meanings more directly accessible to the architect, or the inhabitant who cares to search for them : the physiognomic visage, the stare of the face now divided between two houses; the repetition of the aedicule, 'the little house', that image of domesticity</page><page sequence="36">NOVEMBER I979 EUROPEAN URßANISM AND HISTORICISM Figure 6. Jeremy Dixon , St. Mark's Road Scheme, London , 1976-9, accepts the surrounding Edwardian language and existing street morphology and then introduces subtle changes of scale , aedicules , stained glass , 'faces', etc. ( Photograph , Morley von Sternberg ) which goes back to the Greeks and which has signified homestead ever since; the stained glass and colour syncopations in blues and greens which both give interest and identify a house ; the aedicular entrance gates which hide garbage cans. The scheme is modest and one should not make immodest claims for it, but it does illustrate the level that Post Modern urbanism had reached by the middle seventies. There are two other schemes which also show this degree of knowing eclecticism: Hans Hollein's Travel Bureau in Vienna, completed 1978, and James Stirling's Stuttgart Museum, under construction. Hollein has characteristically preserved the urban fabric and subtly collaged signs of the new function into the old framework. Polished bronze gleams out of the grey neutral grid of the street block. On the inside the various tourist fantasies, and stereotypes, become an excuse for an eclecticism I would once again term Radical because of its semantic appropriateness: ruined columns impaled by chrome shafts signify travel in Greece and Italy; 777</page><page sequence="37">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER 1979 Figure 7. Hans Hollein , Austrian Travel Bureau, Vienna , 1978. Stereotypes of travel distorted and built with care and precision. desert travel is communicated by bronze versions of the palm columns at Brighton; India by a bronze solartopye, theatre tickets by a stage curtain and, ironically, the place where one pays for all of this, the cashier's desk, is signified by the outlines of a Rolls Royce radiator grill. All of this is sheltered under a light-filled coffered vault reminis- cent of the home-town Post Office, the magnificent 'modern' space Otto Wagner built in 1906. Thus local reference is set against foreign, modern images against stereotype and existing urban fabric against infill. Because of the precision craftsmanship the clichés are not kitsch; or rather, in terms of these lectures, the elements of pastiche, which are used to communicate directly to a mass-culture, are lifted above their station. My final example of Radical Eclecticism is hard to discuss objectively partly because it is not finished and partly because its author is tonight's Chairman, an architect who, I know from experience, is bound to disagree with speculative interpretation. Warily I will, nonetheless, proceed. James Stirling's museum in Stuttgart is, like his other German projects, an essay in urban contextualism. It picks up formal cues from 778 the surrounding context, in this case the height and grain of adjacent buildings and the basic axial relationship to the main street. From this entrance axis it layers a sequence of space frontally and at right angles to movement; as in a Rationalist building the grid is felt conceptually throughout although one is forced to move around it in circles and diagonals. Thus a basic dualism is set up between rectilinear and rotational elements. One moves under an entrance arch, a primitive hut, a Schinkelesque gateway, but then to left or right off axis. The U-shaped, symmetrical gallery is in front, but one has to approach it diagonally up a ramp; the circular, open- air sculpture court can be reached on axis, but one moves through it on a perimeter, semi-circular ramp. This connects up finally with a walkway into the more domestic urban fabric. In this circuitous way the public is brought informally right into the heart of the museum. It is an unusual heart, at once familiar like a circular Neo-Classical Museum, and strange, as a dome without a top. Basically the language is Schinkelesque and as eclectic as was that architect, although it is a subdued eclecticism. Barely recognizable</page><page sequence="38">NOVEMBER I979 EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM Figure 8. James Stirling &amp; Partner , Stuttgart Museum, 1977 {under construction). The building picks up the nineteenth-century context and uses German stereotypes of 'museum* &gt; ' culture ', in a fresh way . ( Photograph , John Donat) Romanesque arches open on to the sculpture court, while slightly Eygptian cornices edge the painting galleries. The references signify 'museum', 'art', in the stereotypical way that Hollein's generalized images referred to foreign travel. And of course the overall reference to Schinkel's Neo-Classicism, a German sign of 'culture', is also justifiable. In a sense this plurality of styles with this function creates a miniature of the 'museum city' itself. The handling of this language is at once dramatic and easy-going. The public are brought into the building informally, as mentioned, and then given a straight- forward chronological journey through the history of art with no discontinuities - just as there is a continuous flow between new and old buildings, those he has designed and those he has attached to. The exceptions to this ordinariness (and we would have preferred adding ornament to this list) are the ramps, curves, views across layered space and the paradox of the ťdomeless dome', the inside-out space, the room to- wards which one moves to find oneself outside, cut-off from urban noise and in touch with sculpture or the sky. The ideas behind this, the Mandala, 'the dome of heaven-the-sky', the 'heart of the city' and the circular res publica are, as we have seen, the key ideas of many Post-Modernists. They are as much ideas of content as purely architectural ideas, and in this sense seek to raise, if not answer, a fundamental question of our time: 'what is architecture to be about ?'. To conclude these talks with this question is my final point. The basic problems facing architecture are social, political and meta- physical, not formal and technical. Our society is quite adept at reaching formal and technical standards of excellence, at least in Japan and America, but it has not brought forth either very exciting building tasks or metaphysical mandates. Hence the Sur- rationalist fantasies, or the Japanese games of iconological wizardry, both trying to fill a vacuum; hence the syndicalist utopias or modest attempts at participation; hence the great American attempt at revivalism and significant cultural form. All these Post-Modern tendencies are trying to give birth to a new architecture before consumer 779</page><page sequence="39">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS NOVEMBER I979 society has given it a mandate; it is the sound, as the saying goes, of one hand clapping. It may be, however, the only sound a consumer society is willing to allow, immersed as it is in the joys of private life. This culture is essentially passive, waiting for the directions from its self-appointed élites. What messages it receives to-day are extraordinary in their plurality and breadth. To discriminate among these messages, as well as send them, has also fallen to an élite, that is the 'com- munications industry'. So we are at a most curious juncture in history that is not in fact a turning point at all. Rather we are in for 'more of the same', much more, in fact a recapitulation of all historical archi- tecture including that of the recent past. We are, as you will guess, in a Radically Eclectic age, an age that makes the 1870s with its relative paucity of fifteen styles look like an integrated culture. We have more styles and ideologies than they did then and they probably mean less, have less con- viction and semantic meaning. Gothic- Revival is now a-religious and doesn't carry Pugin's moralistic fervour; Stirling at one time had Gothic arcades for his Stuttgart Museum before they were changed into Romanesque. In our Musée imaginaire , in our museum city that has recapitulated world history, styles have lost their overall meaning and become instead genres - classifiers of mood and theme. This is a major point of Radical Eclecticism; it substitutes a time-bound semiotic view of architectural form for the monolithic view of the past, the Modern and Neo-Gothic views. Its approach to style and meaning is relativistic, related to the context of the culture being designed for, and entails changing those styles and meanings per- haps after they have swung too far one way, or, by contrast, need support and confirma- tion. The two ideas behind this are plenitude and pluralism, the idea that, given the choice, people would rather have a variety of ex- periences and that, as history proceeds, a plenitude of values, a richness, is created on which it is possible to draw. These archi- tectural loans must, to repeat a point, be repaid with interest, that is reinvention. In short the content of our building is not the Space Age or the Energy Problem, not the Machine Age or High Technology, but the variety of cultural experience, the plurality of psychic, social and metaphysical states possible to people.

It seems to me that you have achieved world-wide fame (or infamy?) largely through one of your more recent books. The Language of Post Modern Architecture. Good and stimulating as it undoubtedly is, it is really a book about what has happened - in retrospect, a reporting of what has already taken place. It seems to me that the move away from Modern Architecture (at its most stereotyped) really started in the fifties, and was led by the most interesting architects of that time. Your book may have over-stimulated what I might call the riff-raff of architects, so that it now has a mass following in the far too many eclectic directions which the book describes. The danger is that you might have started a sort of mass lemming movement by the profession over the cliff. In regard to books : I was brought up on Gideon's Space , Time and Architecture , a sort of 'techno- rational' history of modern architecture; then after with articles and books by Pevsner, which might be described as 'Bauhaus - blinkered'. At 780 the time these books were very influential and important for architects and students but now, after a relatively short period, they are hardly remembered at all. I wonder whether your book The Language of Post Modernism might have a similar fate ? However, by that time is it not likely that you will have written another book I which will have supplanted it ? The Lecturer: Let me ask you a question. It seems to me that when the Modern Movement did take over in the schools and in the offices, a lot in the Western tradition was thrown out, and as this tradition has been looked at again in the last twenty years, one by one all of the elements have reappeared with the exception of ornament. Whereas, for instance, Krier is ready to revive any kind of urban morphology and imagery if he can find justification for it, when he is asked about ornament - and I think your position is the same, when you are asked about ornament - he refuses to consider it because he says it is kitsch. Of course one understands what he means. In</page><page sequence="40">NOVEMBER I979 our society a lot of it is kitsch. But I wonder why, | philosophically speaking, it is possible only to accept half of your tradition. What is it that keeps the Europeans and the Rationalists and yourself to a certain extent from a complete re- absorption of the Western tradition and orna- ment and decoration ? The Chairman: I'm concerned about making sort of bridges back to the past, as I find the vocabulary of what was called modern archi- tecture when I was a student to be far too thin and bereft and inadequate for designing build- ings, particularly public buildings in city places. I should like to make buildings that were a kind of welding, a combination of the most radical and memorable aspects of modern design with the past - back into the history of architecture. The present is not enough - one has somehow to look backwards to increase the vocabulary. No period in architecture totally rejected the past and it was only with the Modern Movement that architects took such a brutal attitude. Maybe this has contributed to the destruction of our cities and the banality of modern architecture as you see it everywhere. Thank God, I never built a tower block! My particular concerns at the moment are making buildings where there is a civic function, and they are, I hope, frankly monumental, but that does not mean great size or grandiosity; for me a definition of 'monu- mentar is that of an object which has 'presence'. Therefore a chair could be monumental. The Lecturer: My point is that if people are attracted to decoration (it is one of the most important classifiers of mood and genre, as I have been mentioning), and one of the problems with Krier's architecture and that of the Rationalists is that it reminds people of Fascism and large bureaucracies, then they might have changed these associations by using decoration. The Chairman: I think you can get very confused with pop art or pop architecture. I find pop architecture desperately boring. The whole Venturi kind of American thing is. Mr. Robert Maxwell, riba: But is there not some basic limitation in modern architecture which stops you from decorating ? It is not just straight neo-classicism, it is abstract modern design although with sources in the classical coming back in. In some way architecture went through abstraction like a kind of sieve, and all the decorative bits, separate little bits, were thrown away. If you use decoration now it is too specific. The Chairman: I'm not interested in decoration, but I am in collage. I think Charles Jencks has touched on it - the surreal relation- ship of objects and elements, for instance, a conjunction of the most radical constructivist design of t he twentieth century with associations of the nineteenth century. Both overall and in EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM detail this could be a juxtaposition far more powerful than any idea of decoration. Mr. Robert Byng: Mr. Chairman, what you should be asking the lecturer is whether he believes that all the values he has displayed over the last three lectures are of equal value. You see he never makes a judgement. You were right to say that he is an intelligent reporter, but he appears to have no theory at all. This is what worries me. He scatters before us everything as if of equal value. The Lecturer: In this talk tonight I tried to make apparent a list of priorities. I thought I was coming back too much to the same point, the theory of Radical Eclecticism, but I do think that architecture as a language acting in a certain social and political way is an absolutely key factor. I am not going to advocate a political and social doctrine here. I said in effect what you are saying to me. I said it is the rôle of an élite to make discriminations and I tried to make the discriminations among the architects I showed, whether I liked their politics or their social view or their metaphysic or not. I discriminated on the value that they are honest to those levels of architectural expression. Those levels are the most important ones. What is architecture about ? It is about metaphysical ideas, social and political ideas. It is also about technical and formal ideas. But I do not think they are as important as the first three. And so I showed a series of examples and admittedly they are un- convincing and fragmentary at this stage, because society, being a consumer society and an agnostic society, is not going to go, as previous ages did, towards any one of them. We are in an eclectic age in the sense that anything goes now and therefore nothing means anything. But we are not going to get out of this age by wishing it away. There is no social, political or religious movement that is going to impose itself on the world in a totalitarian sense. In a world of cities, in a consumerist culture, it would be a disaster if we had such a world-wide movement. And I do not think it is possible any more in any case, so I would argue that what we can do as an élite is to recognize who are the most important individuals and which of them are identifying the important problems, and support them. That is what I have tried to do tonight in as clear a way as I can. Mr. Byng: I am not very satisfied with that answer because you have displayed everything equally. I cannot believe that Moore would place the Piazza d'Italia on the same level as some of the other things that he has designed. This is dangerous to the ordinary architect who has not got the time to travel or the scholarship to discriminate on his own. In other words the majority of the profession reads and wishes to learn about a critic's scale of values the hard way and then to come to an opinion. You are dis- playing everything without giving any pointer. 781</page><page sequence="41">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS The Lecturer: I would have thought I support Mr. Moore and our Chairman a bit too much. I thought I came down very heavily the other day in favour of Charles Moore's Piazza d'Italia. So I do not recognize neutrality in what I am doing. I would say that the Piazza d'Italia is a very important building and it happens to be sad that the most important building in Post- Modernism is a fountain. It is not to say that Bernini's fountains are not great but fountains as a building type have their limitations. Nevertheless, in a consumer culture what do I have to look at? Restaurants, World Fairs, endless kitsch examples of traditional building types; in that sense I say that the Piazza d'Italia is not much but it is better than other public facilities we have presently got. We can look at all of these drawings of the public realm as we have seen this evening, but there is a kind of absence in them of a particular culture. You would not know if they were German. You might, but you could not read off a whole lot of ethnic and historical ideas and motives in them. And I think you can in the Piazza d'Italia, so I cannot agree with your characterization of my position. Mr. Noushin Ehsan Bryan: Charles Jencks is one of my favourite historians because he does not impose his point of view on his audiences. He merely presents different happen- ings and appreciates them. Additionally I want to say that it is unfortunate that modern architecture does not correspond with society's needs or society's movements. For example, recently we have had among youth a new group calling themselves Tunk'. The ques- tion is, which architect has really created spaces that can answer their needs ? For this reason one should appreciate architects such as Mr. Sterling and Mr. Venturi and hope for more of their kind of discrepancy and differentiation of thought. Mr. Nathan Silver (Head of Department of Architecture, NE London Polytechnic): I should like to know what Charles Jencks thinks the difference is between the eclecticism we have seen today and the eclecticism of the nineteenth century. Is there really a significant difference in the objective ? The Lecturer: Nineteenth-century eclec- ticism was never developed very far as a conscious theory. Often it was just revivalism or sequential revivalism. Eclecticism means that I select and combine different styles in the same building or, in an urban context, use different styles. Equally it could mean the 'style for the job'. In the twentieth century the style for the job is in any big firm occurring now, and has been since the 1950s. I think I am trying to point out the difference between doing a hybrid or 'macaronic' or 'mongrel' affair, as they called them then, something that is merely an aesthetic mixture which can be nice or can be not so nice, between that kind of eclecticism, which I call 782 NOVEMBER 1979 weak eclecticism, and strong eclecticism, which is semantically motivated: Hollein's buildings, Jim Stirling's buildings, Moore's buildings. They have reasons for their use of ornament and style. Mr. Silver: Don't you see this in the nineteenth century too? The Brussels Law Courts, for example, where there are selections of various periods to teach you that justice is universal. There was a semanticism about the very best examples of the nineteenth century. The Lecturer: There was. And yet, if you look at the literature it is very hard to find a developed theory of eclecticism or many archi- tects talking about it. In other words it was an implicit practice and it was opportunistic. It meant often just a shuffling of the styles to suit the whim of the client - a jumble - and although that can be enjoyable, I don't think it can be very profound. If Mark Girouard were here he could answer this perhaps, but I have never found a developed theory of eclecticism. Certainly the Queen Anne Revival was the most eclectic of all periods and even then they did not want to think much about eclecticism. So I think it does differ in theory from previous eclecticism. Maybe in one hundred years time it will all look the same, but I think it is worth fighting for the difference. Mr. BobAllies: I found it interesting that the Lecturer talked about the metaphysical aspects of architecture but then referred par- ticularly to designs rigorously based upon the typologies of existing European cities or upon the detailed study of signs, of semiology, in buildings. Is there a possibility that that kind of specific study, that kind of analytical composi- tion of buildings, can get in the way of archi- tecture as a metaphysical process ? The Lecturer: Yes, definitely. I think they could easily come into conflict if you did those studies of Vienna and you found this was the language. It could dominate you and could short-circuit a lot of other very interesting approaches. Design is always a multi-level affair that is always in danger of being taken over by one of its parts. That is why to me Late Modernism, which is very interesting, is still dominated by construction and High Tech. to the detriment of all the other concerns. Mr. Brian Clare: My question really relates to the lecture on North America rather than that on Europe. I wonder if Mr. Jencks had any comments on the patrons of Post Modern- ism ? They must be, I imagine, pertinent to any consideration of this movement in architecture, and perhaps there is a particular reason why Europe does not make buildings in the Post Modern style happen in the way that America does ?</page><page sequence="42">NOVEMBER 1979 The Lecturer: I think definitely there is an importance in the difference between the private house in America, where a lot of Post Modernism goes on, and in Europe and in England, where there is not so much private house building, although there is a great deal more than one would imagine. It is a difference in perception as I really understand it. There have been a lot of country houses built in England since the war, and you are just not aware of them because they are unobtrusive in the extreme. But there is the money around and there are clients who in a way want, I think, more and more now in England and Europe, to allow architecture once again to become an art form which expresses these ideas. So in a sense the reason for the difference may also lie in a difference in ideology. For a long time to design a private house in Europe was considered negative, and that has changed; and EUROPEAN URBANISM AND HISTORICISM so I think that in a few years there will be Post Modern houses here. The other reason may have to do with a much more pluralistic culture which is much less secure, which therefore needs to express itself much more fulsomely. Isaiah Berlin has argued that Russia is that way and I think that the same can be said about America, where there is an ethnic mix. It generates a kind of insecurity and desire to express your cultural identities. Why express them in England when everybody knows that they are English and it is all right ? The Chairman: I should like to thank Charles Jencks for this final lecture in a most interesting and stimulating set of lectures, and would ask you all to join me. The meeting concluded with the usual expressions of thanks. 783</page></plain_text>
