Stud. 26, p. 525-541 TIMOTHY FITZGERALD MANSEL'S AGNOSTICISM Nobody is likely to claim that the name of Henry Longueville Mansel is an important one in contemporary Anglican theology. During the 130 years since he gave his Bampton Lectures in 1858 his work has been only spor? adically reviewed. But he deserves more than this. As the title of his lecture - The Limits of Religious Thought - suggests, Mansel was partly responsible for bringing the philosophy of Kant into British religious thinking ; and the problems he faced in trying to make a concept of regulative truth consistent with orthodox Anglican doctrine make his intellectual dilemma of unusual interest to the modern reader. Not only did Mansel introduce Kant into serious theological discussion in England, but he also appeared to many commentators to have himself adopted a form of Kantianism. This seemed to lead him to deny the possi? bility of any knowledge of God, and thus to Agnosticism ; it also seemed to lead him to ethical pragmatism and relativism. The ethical pragmatism was itself a departure from Kant ; but it seemed to follow from his denial of any basis in reason for knowledge of God's moral attributes. The controversy surrounding his Bampton Lectures and other publications was therefore aroused by the perceived incompatibility between his philosophical theology and his position as an Anglican Dean. It is not surprising that Don Cupitt should be amongst those modern commentators that have shown an interest in Mansel. In an interesting and perceptive article, Cupitt has correctly pointed out that Mansel's concern was with the logical status of theological statements in general.1 But sur? prisingly, while characterizing Mansel as 'a strict Kantian', Cupitt has also denied that his doctrine of Regulative Truth was dependent on his phil? osophy of the Limits of Thought.2 In this article my position will differ from Cupitt's claim that Mansel's doctrine of Regulative Truth is independent of his theory of knowledge. But I will also suggest that, taken overall, his dependence on Kant is too inconsistent for their epistemological positions to 1 Don Cupitt, ' Mansel's Theory of Regulative Truth '.

Mansel was more a Hamiltonian than a Kantian,3 with many of the epistemological confusions which that implies. Furthermore, the questioning of the extent and consistency of Kant's influence on Mansel affects one's view of whether or not, x&gt;r in what sense, Mansel was Agnostic. This has some interest in a historical sense, because both Mansel and Hamilton were widely taken (whether they intended it or not) as significant contributors to the agnostic trend of thought in nineteenth century Britain. But the extent of Mansel's agnosticism seems to me to be a theological and philosophical issue as well, and one which has at least some relevance to religious thinking today. My thesis can be roughly divided into four areas. The first is the sense in which Mansel was or was not agnostic in any significant sense. I will argue that he was inconsistent and contradictory on whether or not we can know God, and that the theological inconsistencies reflect epistemological ones. This question is directly connected to two other questions. One is the influence of Kant on his general philosophical and theological position, an influence which, though important, has in my view been overstressed. The other is the importance of other currents of thought which, like his prede? cessor Sir William Hamilton, he seems to have been unsuccessfully attempt? ing to synthesize with Kantian Idealism. I have in mind the common sense realism or intuitionism deriving from Reid and Hamilton, and also the ' way of ideas ' empiricism, with its atomistic concept of the individual and its representative theory of perception. The failure of either Hamilton or Mansel, or any of the other so-called agnostics such as T. H. Huxley and Herbert Spencer to work out a consistent epistemology is one good reason for denying that there existed anything like an agnostic school with a clear philosophical definition. The final area of my thesis here is the inherent problems of rationality and relativism in Mansel's defence of Christian revelation. This last issue is derived from his doctrine of Regulative Truths, and is therefore connected to all the preceding points. Mansel is widely acknowledged to have been an 'agnostic', or at least to have been an important link in the nineteenth-century trend towards ag? nosticism. Spencer, in First Principles, claimed that he was carrying forward the agnostic doctrine of Hamilton and Mansel, and Bevan endorses this4 by describing Mansel as one of the ' progenitors ' of Spencerian agnosticism. Cupitt says that Mansel himself acknowledged the agnostic implications of his metaphysics, and he also points out that T. H. Huxley (who coined the word to describe himself) described Mansel as an agnostic thinker.5 Dockrill 3 A reference to Sir William Hamilton, author of an influential agnostic essay ' The Philosophy of the Unconditioned', Edinburgh Review, 1829. 4 E.

W. Hepburn places Mansel clearly and importantly in the post-Kantian agnostic movement or trend.7 None of this means, however, that there in fact existed any clearly defined agnostic philosophy with a ' hard ' epistemological centre in the nineteenth century. Nor does it mean that Mansel would have been at all happy being bracketed with Huxley or Spencer, who had very different interests and intentions. For Hepburn, and perhaps for these other writers as well, the word Agnosticism is being used in a historical sense to describe a tendency of thought which can be traced back, in part at least, to Kant. If one wants to find a consistent and thorough-going agnosticism, then surely only Kant provides it. Thus, to the extent that Mansel was agnostic at all, he was not simply agnostic in the very loose sense that, like the orthodox Demea in Hume's Dialogues, he held God's transcendence to entail his incomprehen? sibility. His agnosticism had a historical 'location' or frame of reference. The philosophical origin was to some extent Humean scepticism, but perhaps more specifically Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, with its strict delimiting of knowledge. There was no clearly defined agnostic school. Yet Mansel was, after all, a contemporary of Huxley's, and the sense in which it might be held that Mansel was agnostic is in one of the senses given to it by Huxley himself. This is the Kantian sense, which Huxley derived initially from Hamilton, referring to the logical impossibility of knowledge of unconditioned reality. (At other times Huxley seems to suggest that the statement God exists is a factual hypothesis which cannot be verified or falsified.) But when one looks in detail at what this rather broad notion of the limits of thought means, or Hamilton's equivalent The Relativity of Knowledge, then there is considerable doubt about it genuine connection with Kant's theory. Mansel appears to take from Kant the philosophical bits and pieces which he needs to underpin a notion of God's unknowability ; but he ignores, or tries to refute Kant when the philosophical implications look like under? mining the Christian Revelation. Mansel's theological motive, as Cupitt pointed out,8 was to protect the authority of Biblical Revelation from what he took to be the presumptuous judgements of philosophical rationalism. But Mansel was pleased to use philosophical arguments from Kant to do this, when it seemed to suit his purpose. Mansel's central argument, as Dockrill and Cupitt both point out, is that, due to the inherent limitations of human cognition, God is unknow? able, in which case it is impossible for reason to deduce from the supposed 6 D. W. Dockrill, 'The Limits of Thought and Regulative Truths', xxi JTS, (Oct. 1970), 370. 7 R. W.

This spawned a further problem. If God is unknowable, what sense is there in claiming that He is revealed at all? Now there may be a lack of clarity in Kant's own writing about the status of the anthropomorphic representations of God, as I will try to show below. But undoubtedly in the case of Mansel there is unclarity about whether the Biblical imagery bears any relation at all to God's real nature, and therefore whether that imagery is constitutive. Bevan has argued that Mansel was less agnostic on this point than Aquinas,9 because he did believe that something of God's real nature is known through Revelation. But I would suggest that Mansel failed to offer a clear account here, and that he was torn between his orthodox belief and his philosophical commitments. To call him a Christian Agnostic would perhaps be a succinct way of drawing attention to the unresolved conflicts in his writing. But it does not indicate a consistent theological or philosophical system. Another point, which Dockrill mentions,10 is that Mansel followed Hamil? ton in claiming that we have negative knowledge of God's existence, even though the idea of God has no conceivable content. We know that he is, not what he is. But, apart from the question about whether such a position is coherent, it is certainly a departure from Kantian agnosticism, at least in the First Critique, and one imagines that it departed considerably from Huxley's understanding of agnosticism. A further confusion in the meaning of agnosticism in relation to Mansel is whether it is supposed to refer only to knowledge of God, or whether it also involves a limitation on our knowledge of a world independent of our experience ? that is, the world-in-itself. In Kant's philosophy, it is difficult to separate these issues, since the same epistemology makes it problematic how we can separate the question of God's existence from the more general question of noumenal reality.11 I would argue that Kant is agnostic in that his theory of knowledge embraces all metaphysical concepts and supposed entities. Since Kant defines knowledge in such a way that it is confined to appearances, then we can have no knowledge of God, the world-in-itself, the 9 Bevan (1962), p. 291. 10 Dockrill (1970), 381-7. I agree with DockrilFs conclusion that Mansel failed 'to provide an acceptable account of what it means to believe that of which we can form no concept' (p. 386 footnote). But I would emphasize that Mansel adopted Hamilton's theory of negative knowledge which was supposed to be an improvement on Kant. Mansel seemed to accept the Kantian position on the antinomies of reason - viz that they are insoluble - in his Bampton Lectures ( The Limits of Religious Thought, 4th edn. p. viii) but in fact he follows Hamilton and claims that one of the inconceivable opposites must be true. I have discussed the relation between Hamilton, Mansel and Kant in detail in my Ph.D. Thesis Philosophical Issues in Agnosticism since Hume and Kant (London, 1983). Note Kant's distinction between a dialectic and an analytic opposition, which might have been specially written in anticipation of Hamilton and Mansel. {Critique of Pure Reason, trans. N. Kemp Smith, A504/5 -B532/3.) 11 There is a problem in the interpretation of Kant concerning the meaning of noumenal as the 'transcendental ground of appearances ' (see CPR A695/6 -B723/4). The noumenal in the latter sense must be what we fictionalize as God. See Strawson, The Bounds of Sense (1975), p. 211. But a confusion arises with the idea of ' things-in-themselves ' or noumena, a concept which sounds like a misapplication of those very categories of the understanding which Kant had confined to phenomena, and the creation of a third kind of reality intermediate between God and the phenomenal world of appearances.</page><page sequence="5">MANSEL'S AGNOSTICISM 529 ultimate constituents of nature, the First Cause, the Self, Freedom etc.12 These cease to be possible objects of knowledge. But then it ought to follow that the distinctions we make between these putative entities are distinctions in thought only and have only a regulative, not a constitutive function. This is indeed a thorough-going agnosticism ; and on such a theory of knowledge one cannot pick and choose which of such entities are knowable and which unknowable. Mansel is rarely if ever as thorough-going as Kant in his theory of the limits of thought. Though at times he appears to follow Kant - and Cupitt, Dockrill and others refer at different times to the importance of Kant for Mansel - he always goes on to contradict the Kantian position in some way. For instance, he holds that we have a direct and undeniable intuition of the Self as a free moral agent, which Kant devoted his critique of Rational Psychology, and part of the critique of Cosmology, to undermining. He usually assumes either that we have a direct intuition of the object of experience, or alternatively that we have good grounds for inferring that the object is 'represented' by our experience of it. As a consequence, the theory of the limits of thought ceases to be consistently Kantian, and becomes artificially confined to the question whether we have any knowledge of God or not. I am making two points about agnosticism here. The more general is that, assuming as I have done that Kant's philosophy was the most direct source of philosophical agnosticism in the nineteenth century, it binds together the question of our knowledge of God with the other metaphysical questions concerning our knowledge of the Self, the World-in-itself, and noumenal reality generally. And one possible interpretation of Kant is that the logical status of the tri-partite distinctions between God, the World, and the Self is not a real distinction but one in thought only, a line of reasoning that helped Spencer on the way to his pantheism. This Mansel completely rejected, because fundamentally he never doubted such a traditional tri-partite div? ision of reality. This is tantamount to my second point, which is that, despite an appearance of Kantianism in Mansel, his agnosticism is attenuated and its consistency jeopardized by his claims that we know that God exists, that this God must have some inconceivable relation with a real, finite world, and that the Self is self-evidently and undeniably a free moral agent with a directly intuited ontological status. Not only this, but he identifies the un? knowable Unconditioned with the God of Christian Revelation, a Revelation which that God has given to us. Mansel's agnosticism is more appearance than reality. 12 The concepts which Reason tries and fails to establish in Kant's demonstration of the antinomies include God, the Soul, a Necessary Being, a First Cause of the World, the ultimate constituents of matter, the finitude or infinitetude of the world.</page><page sequence="6">53? TIMOTHY FITZGERALD Given Mansel's philosophical concerns, it seems surprising that Cupitt should go to such lengths to criticize Dockrill13 for connecting the philo? sophical theory of the limits of thought with the ' theological doctrine ' of regulative truth. Dockrill tried to show the dependence of Mansel's doctrine of regulative truth on the more general theory of thought and its limits. Now it may, in a sense, be true, as Cupitt holds, that a doctrine of regulative truth need not be derived from a strictly philosophical theory, and that such a doctrine could in some form be derived from the theological tradition in which Mansel was brought up. However, in the writing of Mansel such a distinction is too arbitrary. The question of God's incomprehensibility, and the sense in which we know or do not know God in Revelation, was treated by Mansel as an epistemological problem, albeit one with profound ethical and religious implications. Actually, Mansel follows Hamilton and deliber? ately links the philosophical and theological issues by identifying the learned ignorance of the Socratic tradition with the virtue of humility. Mansel spent considerable intellectual energy trying to give philosophical consistency to his claim that speculative knowledge of the nature of God is impossible, though it is possible to establish by reason that he exists. His debt to Hamilton and other philosophers underlines this point. Cupitt seems curiously inconsistent on this point, though this does not detract from the clarity of his analysis in other respects. For instance, it was Cupitt who rightly pointed out that Mansel was concerned with the status of theological statements in general, rather than with the activity of formu? lating particular theological claims, and this general concern is not only a philosophical one, but is so on his (Mansel's) definition. For in attacking the Rationalists and the mystics, Mansel specifies in the Lectures that he is also attempting to delineate his own philosophy of religion, which is an analysis of the structure and range of human thought. Cupitt also pointed out that the terms speculative and regulative had been suggested by his study of Kant. At one point, admittedly only in a footnote, Cupitt described Mansel as an 'ultra-strict Kantian',14 a notion which I am disputing, but not on the grounds that his doctrine of regulative truths is independent of his philo? sophical position. His departure from Kant, as I will suggest in greater detail below, was partly the result of his philosophical attachment to Hamilton, whose improvement and ' modification ' of Kant15 undermined much of the philosophical consistency of his own writing. It is not difficult to see why Mansel and Kant are always linked, for at times Mansel does seem genuinely appreciative of Kant. The Critique of Pure Reason attempted ' to supply the wisest precepts of the right use of the 13 Cupitt (1971), 544/7. 14 Cupitt (1967), 110. I recognize that Cupitt also emphasizes Mansel's criticism of Kant, but on the different grounds that the 2nd Critique undid the good work of the ist Critique. My point is that Mansel (following Hamilton) undid the good work of the ist Critique, in order to do what he falsely accuses Kant of doing! 15 Philosophy of the Conditioned (1866), pp. 67/8.</page><page sequence="7">mansel's agnosticism 531 legitimate boundaries of reason'.16 and at the same time provided a partial solution to Humean scepticism. He sees Kant's work as part ofthat 'Inquiry' which had been started by Locke and Descartes and continued by Hume 'concerning the origin, and consequently the value, of our ideas'. (Mansel sees his own philosophy of religion in this tradition.) His Bampton Lectures were conceived ' as an attempt to pursue, in relation to Theology, the inquiry instituted by Kant in relation to metaphysics ; namely, how are synthetical judgments a priori possible?'17 The various passages in the Lectures which are indebted to Kant incor? porate the distinctions between speculative and regulative knowledge, and between the noumenal and the phenomenal. Also indebted to Kant is the general philosophical conviction that a process of reason can only be em? ployed validly within certain limits, and to attempt to think beyond those limits leads to antinomial conflict, and thus to unintelligibility. Connected to this is the proposition that all acts of perception are structured, limited, made possible, by the innate principles and categories of the mind.18 Thus the form of apprehension is according to the structure of the human mind; what is given is a synthesis between the given (noumenon) which is itself unknown, and the categorial structure of the mind's activity. When this general philosophical doctrine is applied by Mansel to theology, then it can be said that the noumenal reality which is given in Revelation cannot be known in itself but only according to the limiting form of human appre? hension. Against this general Kantian background, Mansel specifies certain a priori conditions which are fundamental in any act of consciousness - his intention being to proceed to the implications of this for religious thought.19 Conscious? ness is necessarily defined by such conditions, and consequently the notion of unconditioned consciousness is an a priori impossibility.20 Sometimes Mansel states, consistently with Kant, that the distinction between subject and object, which is a necessary relation in all acts of consciousness, is a phenomenal distinction only. That is, it is a condition of the phenomenal consciousness, which for Kant means a distinction in appearance. To claim to have knowledge of distinct subjects and objects in noumenal reality would be, in Kantian terminology, a dogmatic illusion generated by the inherent tendency of the mind to extend its range of concepts beyond their legitimate sphere of operation. For instance, Mansel says To perceive a thing in itself would be to perceive it neither in space nor in time ; for these are furnished by the constitution of our perceptive faculties, and constitute an element of the phenomenal object of intuition only. To think of a thing in itself would be to think of it neither as one nor as many, nor under any other category, for these again depend on the constitution of our understanding, and constitute an element of the phenomenal object of thought. 16 Lecture on the Philosophy of Kant (1956), p. 6. 17 Limits, p. xliii, Preface to 4th edn. 18 Limits, p. xliii. 19 Limits, p. viii. 20 LPK, p. 24.</page><page sequence="8">532 TIMOTHY FITZGERALD Consequently, Mansel continues, 'the thing-in-itself may be dropped out of our reckoning altogether'.21 Mansel must have sensed the danger of this idea for Revelation; for on the same principle the noumenal object of Revelation might be dropped out of our reckoning altogether. Perhaps it was partly this thought that confused Mansel about the true meaning of Kant's doctrine, because he also describes it as meaning that ' the fact of consciousness... (is)... in all cases partly caused by, but in none exactly resembling, the external object'.22 His use of the term thing-in-itself and his frequent identification of it with the 'external object' which the phenomenon in some degree resembles, raises a doubt whether he understands these terms in a Kantian sense, and whether he is consistently conceiving the distinction between subject and object as merely phenomenal. This doubt becomes compounded when, in the Bampton Lectures, he claims that, though the material world is unknown to us in itself, we are compelled to believe in its existence : The natural senses, it may be, are diverted and coloured by the medium through which they pass to reach the intellect, and present to us, not things-in-themselves, but things as they appear to us... but we are compelled to believe, on the evidence of our senses, that a material world exists, even while we are listening to the arguments of the idealist, who reduces it to an idea or a nonentity.23 This is a mechanical or causal account of perception which infers the exist? ence of a real material world laid out in container time and space and causing us to receive sensations in our private consciousness. Thus, despite the complete unknowableness of the thing in itself, it is nevertheless a material, external, individual thing, belonging to an external material world. Furthermore, this real world is a finite entity from which we can infer the existence of an infinite reality. Logically speaking, as Mansel admits, the relations between the finite and the infinite are inconceivable and contra? dictory. Yet he continually asserts that this real finite world, which causes us to have the sensations and perceptions which we do have, is distinct from the Infinite which he identifies with God. This tri-partite scheme is made clear by his constant and frequent attacks on Pantheism, which is atheistic because it questions or denies the real distinctions between the Self, the World, and God.24 Mansel is of course supposing that we do know a great deal about reality, and the meaning of terms like phenomenal and noumenal, which one had thought were being used in a Kantian sense, shifts and slides. The con? ditioned, which in his more Kantian guise is synonymous with the phenom? enal - that is, with appearances - becomes extended to a real finite world 21 LPK, pp. 18-24. 22 LPK, pp. 15/16. Kant attempted to distinguish two different senses of externality, empirical and transcendental (CPR A373). His discussion is full of ambiguities (some of which he acknowledges) but Mansel, influenced by some form of empiricism or realism, seems to be unaware of the change of meaning in his own writing. 23 Limits, p. 81. 24 Phil.

We are now dealing with a tri-partite picture of the universe which is a perfectly conventional Christian notion, and which - as Mansel himself demonstrated, using arguments taken from Kant and Hamilton - is philo? sophically incoherent. In this picture there are three different ontological levels : an Infinite, Unconditioned ; a real, finite, conditioned, material world ; and units of consciousness which receive sensations and representations from the latter. This view of the world is more Cartesian than Kantian ; though there are also leanings towards commonsense intuitionism, whereby we do not infer the existence of the external world so much as directly intuit it. The extension of the limits of knowledge to the real is also assumed with regard to the Self as a free moral agent. The person in this sense is self-evident, 'the great primary fact of all consciousness'.25 This claim forms part of the basis for his theological conclusions : In the sense of moral obligation, I know myself as the agent on whom the law is binding : I am free to choose and to act, as a person whose principle of action is in himself... it is only through this consciousness of personality that we have any ground of belief in the existence of God.'26 Now it is true that Kant held that we have to suppose the reality of the self, freedom and immortality in order to make sense of our moral and other experience. But Mansel is claiming much more than this. The Self is not an Idea of Reason by which we regulate our experience of the world but which, if taken to correspond to a knowable entity, constitutes a dogmatic delusion.27 For Mansel, we have immediate and undeniable access to the self as a free moral agent. There is a fundamental lack of clarity in Mansel's writing about what can and cannot be known. That is to say, the boundaries of the knowable move according to his needs at any given moment. If he needs to criticize the 'Vulgar Rationalists' for supposing that they can reason to the uncondi? tioned, then Mansel stresses that all thought is conditioned, and that the legitimate boundaries of conditioned consciousness is the phenomenal world of appearances which is itself, in a significant sense, the product of the operation of the mind's laws. If, however, he wishes to castigate the Pantheist or the Sceptic, or the Idealist or the Atheist, then he asserts the self-evident reality of the free moral agent, the reality of a material world partly causing the production of appearances in our individual minds, and the reality of the relation between these entities as the necessary condition of consciousness. Mansel was rarely if ever a serious Kantian, because philosophically he never seriously questioned or doubted that the world is as it appears, or that the 25 Limits, p. 36. 26 Limits, p. 82. 27 See Kant's criticism of Rational Psychology, CPR, A382 etc. Also his third antinomy where freedom in general is set against causality.</page><page sequence="10">534 TIMOTHY FITZGERALD self is 'self-evidently ' a free moral agent. His natural theology, as I will show later, rests on these two assumptions. In his Critique of rational theology, Mansel holds that it is a contradiction to suppose that one can be conscious of the Infinite and the Absolute, or of a First Cause which accounts for all existence in time and space (the pheno? menal) and yet is itself beyond time and space (the noumenal). Yet these three notions are fundamental to rational theology.28 Mansel argues that these notions are self-destructive. They are words which do not indicate an object of actual or possible thought, but 'the mere absence of the conditions under which consciousness is possible'.29 The attempts by rational theology to achieve a conception of an object answering to such words must result in contradictions and are therefore futile. Mansel uses the same arguments that Hamilton had used, and they were to be repeated almost verbatim by Spencer in First Principles. Having established very thoroughly that conclusion, Mansel then proceeds ? and again his wording reminds one of Hamilton - to argue that this inability to conceive the Absolute and the Infinite 'indicates nothing concerning the existence or non-existence of That which we try to conceive. It proves our impotence, and it proves nothing more'.30 Indeed, this very impotence in our ability to speculate beyond certain limits without encountering insoluble contradictions 'indirectly leads us to believe in the existence ofthat Infinite which we cannot conceive'. The extent of belief is greater than knowledge; faith reaches further than the intellect. But more than simply being led to believe, Mansel claims ' that it is a duty to believe in that which we are unable to comprehend'. We are compelled by reason to believe in that which has no meaning for us, according to Mansel, by the consideration that the very limits of thought imply a boundary separating the finite from the infinite. The very conception of finitude, limitation, entails the infinite and unlimited, for it would be meaningless to talk of the finite if there was not an implied contrast with the infinite.31 This argument flatly contradicts Kant, I would suggest. But it seems doubly odd that Mansel should use this argument of logical implication, since in his Lecture on Kant he criticized him for claiming a logical inference of the unconditioned from the conditioned. Criticizing Kant for exalting 'the Speculative Reason into the position of a distinct faculty, beyond and su? perior to the Understanding', he claimed that Kant held that, though the unconditioned is ' virtually... unattainable by consciousness', that neverthe? less ' the Speculative Reason has a sort of partial and regulative consciousness of it, and the practical reason completely obtains to it'.32 There may have been a degree of inconsistency in Kant's position, though there is unclarity about Mansel's description of that position as ' a sort of 28 Limits, p. 30. 29 Limits, p. 63. 30 Limits, p. 63. 31 Limits, p. 62/3. 32 LPK, p. 28.</page><page sequence="11">MANSEL'S AGNOSTICISM 535 partial and regulative consciousness of it'. The general position of the Cri? tique of Pure Reason is that the Ideas of Reason (of which God or the Unconditioned is the most important) are misplaced categories, which if taken to correspond to some transcendent object are empty. Their mean? ingful use is generally confined to a purely regulative function, that is, in bringing greater coherence to experience itself. For instance, in rejecting the Ontological Argument (which for Kant is the fundamental argument underlying all attempts to reason from the con? ditioned to the unconditioned), he says: In whatever manner the understanding may have arrived at a concept, the existence of its object is never, by any process of analysis, discoverable within it.33 And various passages in the Natural Dialectic of Human Reason suggest forcefully that the relation between human conceptions of God, which regu? late our view of the world (for instance as having purpose) and noumenal reality itself, is so unthinkable that the anthropomorphic representations could be completely reduced to a logical or explanatory function without any remainder.34 On the other hand, Kant at times seems to contradict himself: ' If... we ask... whether there is anything distinct from the world which contains the ground of the order of the world... the answer is that there undoubtedly is \35 And even more confusingly, he attempts in the Prolegomena to introduce a form of analogy which he claims is an acceptable symbolical anthro? pomorphism in contrast to the dogmatic anthropomorphism which he condemns.36 There are undoubtedly inconsistencies in Kant; but despite this the predominant position of the First Critique is to deny metaphysical and theological knowledge claims, and to give the ideas of reason a purely regulative function. So it is not at all clear what Mansel means when he describes Kant as claiming 'a sort of partial and regulative consciousness' of the unconditioned. Cupitt says that Mansel criticized Kant for undoing in the Critique of Practical Reason the good work done in the Critique of Pure Reason, ' by claiming that Practical Reason can do what Pure Reason cannot'.37 But the irony is that Mansel adopted the notion of Negative Knowledge invented by Hamilton, and supposedly an improvement on Kant, which in fact contra? dicted the good work done in the First Critique by making precisely the kind of error which he (and Hamilton) attributed to Kant. Following Hamilton, Mansel argues that the very limits of thought entail the existence of the unconditioned beyond those limits; and 'the denial of its existence involves a contradiction'.38 One of the two inconceivable opposites 33 CPR, A639/B667. 34 CPR, A687/8-B725/6. 35 CPR, A695/6-B723/4. 36 Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, intro.

In contrast, Kant distinguished between a dialectical opposition and an analytical opposition. In the case of an analytic opposition the falsity of the original statement necessarily involves the truth of that opposed to it. In the case of dialectical opposition both statements may be false. Because the arguments in the antinomies are based on the false assumption that assertions can be made about the world as it is in itself, the oppositions appear, to those who subscribe to them, to be analytic contra? dictions. But for Kant, what we mean by the world (the phenomenal) is merely a series of appearances to which it is meaningless to apply either finitude or infinitude.39 Neither Hamilton nor Mansel satisfactorily dealt with this point ; and despite the appearance of Kantianism in their writing they are here filling the role of ontological dogmatists which Kant was criticizing. Mansel also argues that we are compelled to believe that this Un? conditioned reality is God, and that we are compelled to believe in the existence of God as Personal by the religious consciousness. When he makes this claim, it is important to bear in mind that he has argued that, not only is the notion of the Unconditioned incoherent internally, but that the idea that the unconditioned could be revealed in anthropomorphic imagery is also contradictory. Yet he says that God manifests Himself to man 'in consciousness as in scripture, under finite forms to finite minds, as a Person to a Person'. We feel reverence for, obedience to, dependence on, God, even though we do not know God Himself. These sentiments are expressed in the anthropomorphic images of Him as Maker, Governor, Sustainer, Redeemer, the God upon whom ' we are dependent... for our daily bread, for forgiveness of sins, for deliverance from evil'.40 Mansel's approach to this problem of identifying the Biblical imagery of Revelation with the Unconditioned is far from clear, as other commentators have suggested.41 The problem can be simply formulated by asking how can any possible meaning be given to a Revelation that does not reveal anything that is conceivable? The following quotations indicate the vagueness of Mansel's approach to this problem: We cannot conceive the manner in which the unconditioned and the personal are united in the Divine Nature ; yet we may believe that, in some manner unknown to us, they are so united.42 ... God condescends to convey to us, not the very reality indeed, but something as near the reality as He sees it expedient for us to know.43 ... we do not know God as He is in His absolute nature, but only as He is imperfectly represented by those qualities in His creatures which are analogous to, but not identical with, his own...44 39 CPR, A504/5-B532/3.

Mansel was prepared to believe that there was a resemblance, though you could not know in what way'.49 There seems to be some truth in Bevan's assessment here. Mansel, aware of the circle of his (and Hamilton's) philosophy of negative knowledge and positive rev? elation, appeals to mystery as to how these 'truths' of Revelation can be truths about God.50 Yet these quotations suggest some doubt about what is meant by 'resemblance', 'reflection', 'representation', 'analogy', 'dimly indicate'. In one place Mansel suggests that God's nature is different in kind, not merely degree, from human nature.51 Cupitt suggests that there was a time sequence involved in this, a pro? gressive abandonment of ' the original strictness of his doctrine of regulative truth', and a move towards 'a kind of theory of analogy'.52 This may have been true; but Cupitt's conclusion that 'His original position, bleak though it is, is surer' is arguable. If his original position was that regulative truths are not constitutive, tell us nothing about the real nature of God, and are merely ways of organizing our moral experience, then the fundamental claim of Revelation to be a Revelation becomes problematic. On Cupitt's under? standing of Mansel - that he wished to protect Revelation from the pre? sumptions of reason - Mansel surely never wished to relinquish his orthodox belief that the Christian Revelation is in some fundamental sense true. But what idea of truth is involved here? Was Mansel in fact a pragmatist and empiricist, such that statements of religious belief are only meaningful if taken as exhortations to behave in a certain way? The fact appears to be that Mansel wavers on this point, as the above quotations indicate. As a believer, he believed that God revealed something of Himself. And yet the philosophical implications of a purely pragmatist ethic are there. And this leads to my final problem, which is the rationality of Christian belief in Mansel's philosophical theology. For if we can know 45 Limits, p. 170. 46 Limits, p. 75. 47 Limits, p. 79. 48 Limits, p. 80. 49 Bevan (1962), p. 291. 50 Limits, p. 172. 51 Limits, p. 26. 52 Cupitt (1967), 115.

This question makes Mansel's assessment of the authenticity of Revelation on purely internal criteria all the more urgent. By 'internal' criteria I mean putative factual claims made by the tradition itself, that is by the church, or by the Bible interpreted by the church. However, Mansel described the performance of miracles and the fulfilment of prophecy, two of his evidences, as 'external evidences', in contrast to the 'internal evidence' by which he meant the moral character of the doctrine and its superiority over other systems of ethics. For Mansel, the right use of reason is not in making judgements about the adequacy or consistency of the contents given in Biblical Revelation. This would pre-suppose knowledge of God independent of Revelation, and he has disposed of this as a rationalist presumption. The right use of reason is in an assessment of the grounds for believing scripture to be inspired : ... the legitimate object of a rational criticism of revealed religion, is not to be found in the contents of that religion, but in its evidences. The authenticity of Christian revelation is not demonstrative, but can only be arrived at by balancing probabilities ; that is, by assessing the combination of available evidences. These include : ( 1 ) ... the internal character of the doctrines... ' ; (2) the facts connected with its first promulgation ... ; (3)... its subsequent history and the effects... among mankind. Mansel spends far more time on the evidence of ' the internal character of the doctrines', by which he means essentially their moral superiority. The problem is that he cannot establish this moral superiority as a self-evident truth, as he himself admits. But nor can he establish it by deducing it from the nature of God known independently of Revelation. The final position of the Bampton Lectures appears to be that the crucial test of the validity of a revelation depends on the 'authority of the teacher who proclaims it; and that authority itself must then be guaranteed by the external evidence of a superhuman mission'.54 For in the absence of knowledge of the nature of God, except through revelation itself, there can be no independent way of judging the superiority of its moral content. Mansel, however, is unable to ' enter upon any detailed examination of the positive Evidences of Christi? anity'.55 W. R. Matthews comments: Mansel has nothing fresh to say about these external evidences - they are the traditional triad of fulfilment of prophecy, miracles, the rapid spread of Christianity 53 Limits, p. 152. 54 Limits, p. 158. 55 Limits, p. 167.</page><page sequence="15">mansel's agnosticism 539 in the early centuries, to which he adds the wonderful adaptation of the gospel to human needs. It is astonishing that so acute a thinker seems not to have noticed that this last argument may, with a slight change of emphasis, be employed against the supernatural source of Christian teaching. Mansel was ready to stake all on the validity of the Biblical Revelation as interpreted by the church, and one cannot read his confident and defiant assertions, even after this lapse of time, without a shud? der...56 Mansel's position looks very thin. We can know nothing of God indepen? dent of Revelation ; we do and we do not know the nature and will of God in the anthropomorphic imagery of Revelation; and the rational grounds for believing that it is indeed a Revelation of God (rather than the mythological expression of socially desirable behaviour) cannot be properly established. A great deal rests on his claim that the moral superiority of Christianity, though not self-evident, is a significant evidence that the Christian Revelation is divinely inspired. Mansel lays considerable emphasis on the moral superiority of Christi? anity. Bevan has pointed out that, in effect if not in intention, it is an appeal to a self-evident truth.57 Mansel constantly stresses that it is how a person acts that is important in religion, not what he knows.58 But since God is unknown, he argues that the validity of Christian ethics can only be judged by an appeal to the behaviour itself, rather than an appeal to God's nature. How far, he asks, does this professed Revelation promote or hinder Man's moral development.59 But Mansel can offer no criterion by which this can be judged. It was for this reason that F. D. Maurice made the remark that for Mansel, Revelation was the Bible interpreted by the prevailing orthodoxy of the day.60 It could be held that a strong implication of Mansel's position is that the acceptability of the beliefs depends not on their truth but on the desirability of the consequential behaviour. And it is a very short step from here to the problem of historical and cultural relativism in moral standards. It is an equally short step to the proposition that the meaning of the beliefs is their use in a social context. One famous formulation of this position was that by R. B. Braithwaite.61 Mansel never took this latter step, and he never quite clarified the problem of relativism, even though he was sufficiently conscious of this quagmire opening up beneath him to keep drawing back from danger. One apparent safety line was the claim that the consciousness of moral 56 W. R.

Braithwaite, An Empiricist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief (1955). One might also consider the attempt by Basil Mitchell to establish the rationality of Christian theism in his The Justification of Religious Belief (1973). Put very generally, Mitchell argues that it is possible to argue a cumulative case for the rationality of theism on the grounds that it makes best interpretative sense of all the available evidence.</page><page sequence="16">540 TIMOTHY FITZGERALD obligation compels us to believe in ' the existence of moral Deity, and to regard the absolute standards of right and wrong as constituted by the nature ofthat Deity'.62 This is because, in order to identify what is strictly a moral demand or duty, as distinguished from personal inclination or desire, it must carry the authority of God. But this attempt to avoid the problem of moral relativism, or to avoid a view of Revelation as mythology, lands him back with his other problem about knowledge of God. Because in these passages Mansel clearly attributes morality to both man and God in the same sense. In this area of his writing, his confusion about whether we do or do not know the nature of God is evident. For on the one hand, 'The moral nature of man... reflects, and represents, in some degree, the moral nature of a Deity'.63 But alternatively the logical incompatibility of, for instance, God's Goodness and Mercy with evil and suffering means that human predicates must be used in a different sense when applied to God. Ultimately Mansel falls back on the notion of moral miracles to paper over the major inconsistencies in Biblical accounts of God's supposed Goodness.64 It is also worth noting that Mansel always assumes that God is Good. But if our knowledge of God only comes (if it comes at all) through Revelation, then, to our finite minds God reveals himself as both Good and Evil. To claim that this is an apparent contradiction which does not really disprove the goodness of God is in effect to claim to know something of the nature of God independently of Revelation. SUMMARY (i) The question of Mansel's Agnosticism tends to be a question about how consistently Kantian he is. At times he does appear as can ultra-strict Kantian', to use Cupitt's phrase. At such times he makes a distinction between the phenomenal ? that is, appearances structured according to the forms of the intuition and the categories of the understanding - and the noumenal, which transcends these categories and therefore is unknown and unknowable. Such putative realities as God, the self, freedom, design or purpose in nature, the world-in-itself, are merely ideas of reason which have heuristic value in our total ordering of experience, but which can be given no conceivable or intelligible content if taken to correspond to realities beyond our empirical (phenomenal) experience. (2) Mansel rarely if ever holds to this thorough-going agnosticism, and his use of terms such as phenomenal, noumenal, conditioned, and unconditioned slip and slide, partly under the influence of Hamilton. Both Hamilton and Mansel dissipate Kantian agnosticism in several ways and for both philo? sophical and theological reasons. Philosophically, they are influenced by both common-sense realism and ' way-of-ideas ' theories of knowledge and 62 Limits, p. 74. 63 Limits, p. 75. 64 Limits, pp. 158/9.</page><page sequence="17">mansel's agnosticism 541 perception. The categories of the understanding are extended beyond appear? ances to a supposed real, material world and self-evidently free moral agents. The Unconditioned becomes a further real entity which, though unthink? able, must exist. This unthinkable entity is then identified with God who reveals Himself in anthropomorphic images and who therefore both is, and is not, thought. (3) These contradictions are, however, only apparent. The relation sug? gested by 'represents', 'dimly indicates', 'resembles', is a mystery beyond human apprehension. It is anyhow not up to humankind to judge the adequacy or inadequacy of the contents of Revelation ; all we can do is to judge the reasonableness of the Evidences, such as fulfilment of prophecy, performance of miracles, the success of the early church, and the superiority of the moral behaviour to which Christianity gives rise. If we consider the available evidence, we will see that, on a balance of probabilities, it is reasonable to believe that the Bible is inspired, that it therefore has authority, and that we should therefore in some sense believe it to be true. The argument for Christianity's moral superiority is an important one for Mansel, but he never comes anywhere near establishing it. He offers no criterion for judging the issue external to the Christian tradition itself, and he admits that the claim to moral superiority is not self-evident. The only way he can save himself from moral and cultural relativism is by appealing to the sense of moral obligation in man; such obligation can only be explained by appeal to a Moral Governor of the universe who implanted it. However, the only way Mansel could establish this is to claim to know the nature of God independently of Revelation, thus reverting to the position of the 'Vulgar Rationalists' whom he castigated. Mansel was caught in a circle. On the one hand he was a courageous and original thinker who attempted to follow philosophical reason on funda? mental questions where it would lead him. On the other hand he was an orthodox Anglican who wished to protect the authority of Revelation, and to uphold the traditions of the church against both scepticism and ration? alism. When reason led him into dangerous, and peculiarly modern, di? lemmas, the orthodox Anglican preacher pulled himself back. Consequently, contemporaries of different persuasions began by not understanding him and ended by disagreeing with him.65 Aichi Gakuin University, Japan. 65 I am grateful to Professor Stewart R.
