In In his masterly study of Maimonides, Seeskin convincingly argues that it was Maimonides' firm conviction that 'without</page><page sequence="2">414 REVIEWS philosophy, Judaism is a religion manque' (p. 175), in other words, philosophy is an integral and indispensable part of Jewish self-understanding. Doubtless, Seeskin's exposition of Maimonides' idea of God in particular and monotheism in general will provoke an outcry from those who do not share Maimonides' praise of reason. Nor will it be much appreciated by those who look to religion solely for solace for their emotional distress and anxieties, or by those to whom ritual observance of their religion is more important than its philosophical content. Seeskin has spelled out his conclusions more directly than some contemporary commentators on Maimonides' thought, who may have been concerned not to offend religious sensibilities. However, these is clear tendency in present-day scholarship (see e.g. Menachem Kellner, Must a Jew believe anything? (London, 1999) and Ehud Benor, Worship of the Heart. A Study in in Maimonides' Philosophy of Religion (Albany, N.Y., 1995)) to give greater appreciation to the philosophical content of Maimonides' writings. Seeskin develops his interpretation of Maimonides' search for God in seven chapters. The first chapter discusses the indispens able role ascribed by Maimonides to philosophical inquiry with the purpose of strengthening religious belief. This is followed by an examination of Maimonides' notions of monotheism and of God, of creation, imitatio Dei, and human freedom. The final chapter takes issue with the idea of a personal God and other erroneous, but deeply ingrained, notions of popular religion, some of which Maimonides hoped to correct. An appendix and an additional small chapter are devoted to Seeskin's critique of L. Strauss's well-known interpretation of Maimonides, and contain a rejection of what Strauss had termed 'Maimonides' esotericism'. Seeskin asserts that, in the course of Jewish history, prophets and philosophers have expressed concern and dissatisfaction with the attitude and belief of the masses. Thus, while Maimonides' intention to bring Judaism back in line with its intellectual content from which the masses have strayed is not unique, his method of achieving that aim certainly was. The philosophical effort demanded by Maimonides to achieve this aim has been regarded by many commentators as impossible save for but a few philosophically trained individuals. Hence, they have suggested a rift between Maimonides the philosopher, and Maimonides the codifier of Jewish Law. For Seeskin, the choice of either the philosophical—scientific or the religious approach to</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 415 Judaism constitutes 'a false dichotomy' (p. 6), for he believes that Maimonides tried to harmonize these seemingly juxtaposed inter ests by demonstrating both their respective merits, and also their weaknesses, when called upon to engage in the conceptual search for God. Only an 'ignoramus' could believe that he already possesses an adequate understanding of God. Not only must complacency be refuted, but it must also be accepted that neither approach is adequate to provide us with a neat and compact idea of God, even though they both 'call for a critical examination of God and human reason' (p. 18). The best we can do is to use both traditions in order to acquire an intellectual approximation to God in a life-long learning process, which will stretch human aware ness to the limit of its capacity. Philosophy is needed to correct the anthropomorphic imagination of prophecy, while the prophetic tradition helps to correct the tendency of philosophers to apply principles taken from physics and metaphysics to the concept of God (p. 18). Although Maimonides believed that one's love of God was directly proportional to one's knowledge of God (GP iii.51), neither philosophy nor science are able completely to satisfy and reassure us. While philosophical inquiry can take us to the limit of our reasoning process, it will also leave us with a feeling of awe and humility in the face of a being infinitely greater than our selves. At the height of intellectual activity we therefore become paradoxically all the more aware of our incapability to achieve a full understanding of the Divine and realize our own insignific ance sub specie aeternitatis. The challenge of monotheism consists in a single, non-material and unique Deity which is logically separ ated from the world as expressed by the Hebrew root קדש. Any linguistic category particularizes its subject, which is why Maimonides hopes to avoid defining or restricting God in any such terms by proposing instead to use the via negativa. This in turn allows us to think of God as wholly other, as totally off the scale of comparison to anything we know. Maimonides' recognition of language as an imprecise and misleading tool (with some potential for idolatry) leads to his teaching being full full of reservations and ultimately accounts for his dialectical style. According to Seeskin, Maimonides' modesty and intellectual integrity do not let him claim that 'what reason cannot compre hend, revelation can', but that our highest obligation is to pursue the truth, regardless of whether it is consoling or comfortable, because the danger is that if God is measured in human terms, love of God becomes self-love.</page><page sequence="4">416 REVIEWS Maimonides' emphasis on the infinite distance between God and the world raises the question of creation and also of the purpose and effectiveness of prayer. As for creation, Seeskin gives careful consideration to the various theories prevalent in Maimonides' time. He points out Maimonides' own hesitation in the matter, but that there was also no pressure on him to reach a single, fixed conclusion (p. 71). Seeskin's own interpretation of Maimonides' presumption of creation combines free will in God (not as a result of change, but as a spontaneous act of volition resulting in a creatio de novo) with a maximum separation between God and the world: 'God creates the world, but does not enter into a relation with it' (p. 52). Of course, there are still unanswered problems: what exactly does creation mean? The imposition of order on chaos, or the creation of time and space? Given the huge separation between God and the world, the traditional perception of prayer has to be corrected. The activity of praying must not lead us to believe that God is easily access ible or that God can easily be appeased. Maimonides insists that genuine worship is completely disinterested! While God is ultimately beyond praise, standardized prayer can help the believer to avoid relapsing into heretical images. It has also the formative function, according to Seeskin's interpretation of Maimonides, to teach us 'learning to will that which is desirable in itself' (p. 50). Although prayer is not the highest form of worship, as it does not 'lift people to a higher level of awareness [...[... it] prevents them from falling to lower ones' (p. 57). For Maimonides, the crux of monotheism is not the forgiveness of sins, but the overcoming of idolatry (p. 118). God's mercy does not erase guilt! We are responsible for our actions and man makes himself into what he is or destined to become (p. 164). The benefits we receive from God are the gift of reason and all of creation by which we, as human beings in general, not I as an individual, receive God's graciousness. According to Maimonides, increasing our theoretical know ledge of God's attributes of action manifested in the created order, and focusing on the eternal vastness of the heavenly realm improves our ethical behaviour. Learning to separate that mater ial part of us which is time-bound, and looking at the world from a higher, broader perspective, will render obsolete the need for a personal afterlife or the belief in a material reward. Con sequently, reason allows us to view everything as 'further evidence of the beauty of God's governance of nature', although we also come to recognize the limits of our reasoning (pp. 122f.).</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 417 What then is the significance of Jewish observance? According to Maimonides, ritual should be an inducement to further study, not an end in itself. Although the ritual fosters a sense of identity and gives all people something tangible, its ultimate aim is to encourage people towards an active state of reflection and study. This is turn gives humans the freedom to gather and select their information freely and from many different sources and to reflect upon their chosen commitments. Seeskin's interpretation of Maimonides will not satisfy those who want a closer relation between God and humanity. However, Maimonides' resistance to the humanizing of God and his recog nition of 'the radical asymmetry of God's uniqueness and our relative obscurity' (p. 159), will be appreciated by those who look for intelligibility in the overall scheme of things and a dignified, albeit uncertain notion of God. It is to Seeskin's credit that he has not only clarified Maimonides' approach to God, but also elucidated the notion of monotheism, and the profound differ ences of the concept of God in Judaism, albeit in Maimonides' interpretation, in contrast with the Christian faith. Seeskin takes the reader through the arguments of those philo sophers on whose thought Maimonides drew and the arguments of those who later criticized Maimonidian ideas (Kant, Hegel, H. Cohen). In spite of certain obvious similarities between Maimonides' rational thought and that of Spinoza, Seeskin does not mention the latter. However, one cannot fail to be reminded of Spinoza when reading the sentence: 'Once we get beyond systems of thought, we do not get a personality but something that is utterly devoid of emotions and dispositions' (p. 161), although— and here is indeed one huge difference—while Maimonides' God is characterized more by distance and transcendence, Spinoza's God is also immanent and can confidently be deduced from the logical order of the universe. Both philosophers believed in knowledge; Spinoza relied perhaps too heavily on reason alone, whereas Maimonides was more circumspect: 'Reason cannot love God until it admits its own inadequacy before God' (p. 161).
