A CRITICAL READING OF HASAN HANAFFS PROJECTS "THE ISLAMIC LEFT" AND "OCCIDENTALISM" (AND THEIR UNCRITICAL READING)1 BY MARTIN RIEXINGER G?ttingen One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that George Orwell2 Abstract Hasan Hanafi" is often described as leading and original reformer of Arab thought, renovator of the Islamic cultural heritage (tur?th) and advocate of political freedom. But these categorizations are based on insufficient analyses of his writings on both the Islamic and the Western intellectual heritage as well as his statements on current political issues. A critical reading of the first unveils that Hanaf? misrepresents religious and philosophical doctrines and that he systematically passes over the fact that the relations between intellectual currents which he claims as role models for the "Islamic left" were marked by deep enmity. His writings on Marxism reveal that he merely condemns capitalism on moral terms without deeper analysis of the way it works. He himself proposes the idea of historical cycles determining the course of Eastern and Western civilization. This allows him to predict the imminent decline of the latter. The contradicting elements in Hanaf?'s thought do, however, gain coherence when analyzed in the context of his writings on the modern history of Egypt and the Middle East at large. Here he juxtaposes activist and progressive Nasserism to the religious quietism used by Sadat to legitimize his 1 This article is based on an M.A. thesis at the "Orientalisches Seminar" of the Eberhard-Karls-Universit?t T?bingen in 1996.

From 1978 onwards he became an advocate of the Islamic revolution in Iran which he saw as rebirth of Nasserim and Tiermondism in general. In 1981, Hasan Hanaf?, professor of philosophy at Cairo University, published the first and only issue of the magazine al-Tas?r al-Isl?mx. The title was also intended to serve as the label of a new ideological movement. Profiting from the quest for a "Muslim Luther"3 Hanaf? is a frequent guest at major international conferences4 and he served as program adviser at the International University in Tokyo. He is one of only 7 living authors to whom an article in "The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World" has been dedicated. This attention notwithstanding there is no comprehensive analysis of the major aspects of his thought in Western languages.5 Although Hanaf? himself explicitly aims at bringing about political changes by his ideological activity, most of the western presentations of his thought deal with his project of istighr?b ("occidentalism") or his reformulation of tur?th without trying to assess their position in the context of Egyptian politics.6 The majority of authors dealing with Hanaf? praises him as original rationalist thinker who presents Islam as enlightenment.7 Here, I will try to assess whether Hanaf? is likely to come up to such expectations. A closer look at the actual intentions and concrete proposals of Islamic ideologists is most necessary in times when discussions in current Islamic studies increasingly center on the problem of how someone defines an "identity" on the most abstract possible level of "discourse". I will try to close this gap with an examination of the following works by Hanaf?: 1. al-Dxn wa-l-Thawra fix Misr, an eight-volume collection of articles, interviews and speeches intended to have a direct political impact. They were written in the late seventies and early eighties, when Hanaf? decided to favour political action over theoretical reflection 3 Kramer pp. 5 2ff. 4 Recent examples from Germany: "Fortschritt und Religion" hosted by the Goethe Institut http://www.goethe.de/ins/vb/prj/fort/fur/hah/deindex.htm.

The booklet a\-Tur?th wa-1-Tajd?d in which Hanaf? explains the methodological premises and the objectives of his project to revolutionize culture and politics of the Islamic World in accordance with its "heritage"; 3. Min al-Aq?da il? l-Thawra, a "reinterpretation" of kal?m in the context of the aforementioned project; 4. al-Muqaddima fix cIlm al-Istighr?b, another part of this project, combining a conventional handbook account of Western philosophy with the most extensive presentation of Hanaf?'s views on the development of Western civilization; 5. Hiw?r al-Mashriq wa-l-Maghrib, the public correspondence with the Moroccan professor of philosophy al-J?biri in the Paris based weekly al-Yawm al S?bic. Hanaf?'s recent writings dedicated to the issue of "globalization" will occasionally be touched upon. Furthermore I will refer to writings on Hanaf? by major critics in the Arab world. The three most important examples are refutations from different ideological points of view. But while his former student Abu Zayd concentrates on criticizing Hanaf?'s methodological premises in Naqd al-Khit?b al-D?n?, the Jordanian Communist N?hid Hattar and Jurj Tar?b?sh?, the exponent of psychoanalytical literary criticism in the Arab World, indulge in malicious polemics.9 An analysis of Hanaf?'s writings poses several problems. The most severe one has been singled out by Tar?b?sh?: "When one reads Hanaf?'s writings, what catches the eye first is the author's almost infinite ability to contradict himself."10 This article attempts to explain this 8 i.5 Muqaddimat al-tabca al-?l?. 9 Tar?b?sh?'s theses would deserve a study of its own, but I will not deal with his argu ments based on psychoanalysis, because of my lacking competence to evaluate this method and my doubts concerning its scientific value. His study on Hanaf? is preceded by a theoreti cal outline and a demonstration of his theses with reference to a large number of intellectuals from different political camps (pp. 17-101): By paralleling individual and collective psychic development, Tar?b?sh? denounces the entire tur?th-discourse as regressive [nuk?s?) reaction to the traumatic shock (sadma, radda) caused by the confrontation of the omnipotent over father "West", depicted with phallic symbols (khanjar Isr?% with its air-force in 1967). This, he says, led to a neurotic flight towards collectives depicted with female, maternal images (such as umma,jamah?r). These collectives allow the individual to merge with them and thus spare it the confrontation with reality. The manifestation of this flight reflex is a narcissistic compensation [tarm?m narjas?) marked by an idealization of collective identity and a regres sion towards pre-logical (qabmantiq?) and magical thought, which renders a realist approach towards reality impossible. 10 Tar?b?sh?

Another problem is Hanaf?'s tendency rather to evoke than to explain.11 He reduces complex systems of thought to one or two catchwords, or he even confines himself to name-dropping. To imagine what the actualized tur?th should look like is left to the reader. On the other hand, where Hanaf? deals with the Islamic heritage, he often cites doctrines by referring to "the elders", "the culam?}", "the Islamic thinkers", thus suggesting that certain doctrines represent Islam as such. Moreover, he takes theological and philosophical terms (especially tawhxd 12) out of context and gives them a suggestive meaning. Hanaf?'s understanding of the Terms "Ideology" and "Left" In the editorial of his magazine al-Tas?r al-Islam?, Hanaf? declares that the project of an "Islamic Left" continues al-Afgh?n?'s and cAbduh's efforts to unite the umma in resistance to imperialism and to modernize the Islamic creed by taking into consideration the political and social needs of the Muslim masses.13 But Hanaf?'s objectives are more far reaching: he aims, as a c?lim multazim (= engag?), at designing a new ideology. For him this term implies a positive notion. He stresses this by equating it with "science" in a Third World context. Due to his intention of founding an ideology on the basis of tur?th instead of a "museum of thoughts" he refutes methods that would question the relevance of theological, legal and philosophical concepts for the present.14 He underlines the main intention of his ideological activities 11 Hildebrandt p. 46. 12 i.l43ff. muqawwim?t al-shakhsiyya al- arabiyya, speech in Tripolis, 1984 (henceforth muqawwim?t); in an interview by Navid Kermani following the German edition of his Naqd al-khit?b al-dxn?, Abu Zayd (1996) p. 206 does not explicidy refer to Hanaf?, but it is obvious at whom his criticism of the associative and anachronistic use of religious terminology is directed. 13 viii.3, lb,madhaydn? al-yas?r al-islam?, 1981 (henceforthyas?r) the name of the maga zine project was intended to be al-Urwa-1-wuthq? al-jadxda or al-Man?r al-jadxd first; vii.5 al yas?r wa-l-yam?nfi l-fikr al-dxn?, 1976 (henceforth y am?n, the article is a talkh?s o?

Therefore the desire to attempt to confront ideologies of today with an Islamic ideology is still alive in our thought.15 In the introduction to Min al-Aqlda il? l-Thawra, he alludes to Marx by stating that it is not his aim to improve the understanding of the World but to change it. In al-Tur?th wa-1-Tajd?d, he describes revolutionary change as the result of ideological activity16, and with a sideswipe at al-Ghaz?l? he calls for an ihy?' cul?m al-duny?.17 The use of the term "Left" is justified by Hanaf? as a terminological convention with reference to the "Hegelian" and the "Freudian Left". He considers all those political or philosophical currents as leftist that side with the oppressed masses against the status quo, thus disassociating the term from the exclusive association with Marxism.18 The Umma's Seven Challenges and the four National Currents According to Hanaf? the Islamic umma is currently facing seven major challenges [tahaddiy?t al-asr) to which a new revolutionary ideology is supposed to develop adequate responses19: some peripheral remarks cannot neutralize the practice of several volumes; according to Campanini p. 117n28, Hanaf?'s anti-historism is due to the influence of Husserl. But this philosopher's anti-historism is one aspect of his anti-relativist epistemology: Husserl pp. 323 341. As will be shown, Hanafi can in no way be considered an anti-relativist; for a critical asessment of Hanaf?'s reception of Husserl cf.

Tah?r al-ard: all occupied Muslim territories, particularly Palestine, are to be liberated from non-Muslim rule. He explicitiy counters "Erets Israel" as the central topos of Zionist ideology.20 2. The liberties: Hanafi" draws a bleak picture of an Arab world suffering from tyranny and the absence of freedom. 3. Social justice: Hanaf? calls for the abolition of the blatant inequality inside the Islamic societies and of the gaps between the rich and the poor Islamic states. 4. Unity instead of fragmentation: A united umma ought to replace the present assembly of small artificial Arab states. These are proud of their flags and anthems but their borders are artificial, and their existence is not justified by any national identity. Therefore he rejects rivalling ideologies like tribalism (qab?iliyya), confes sionalism (t?'ifiyya) and particularism {qutriyya). 5. Identity instead of Westernization: he calls for the creation of a real synthe sis between modernity and tradition, instead of the Western model of a "total break with the past", or the eclecticism prevailing in the contemporary Muslim world. 6. Material progress for the masses. 7. Mobilization of the masses against passivity. The second main objective of the "Islamic Left" is a united front of action composed of Egypt's "four national currents" (al-tayy?r?t al wataniyya al-arbacd): Liberalism, Marxism, Nasserism and the "Islamic movement". Liberalism, which Hanafi equates with the bourgeois nationalist movement, receives the least attention. He praises its role in the development of modern educational institutions in Egypt as well as its leading role in the formation of a national consciousness. Earlier generations of liberals, like al-Taht?w?, generally receive a more favourable treatment, because they did not yet question Egypt's Islamic identity, whereas Hanaf? criticizes later representatives, like T?h? Husayn or the neo-Wafd for propagating Westernization and reconciliation with imperialism.21 Revolutionary and Reactionary Religion "Religion is the opium of the people and the cry of the wretched creature" 20 Explicitly in Hanaf?, "Berlin" p. 105. 21 viii.69jv?war,Jabin/Hanafi, Hiw?r pp. 59f.; Hanafi, Muqaddima pp. 50ff.; on the Neo Wafd: Hanafi, "Berlin" p. 86.</page><page sequence="7">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 69 This quotation from Marx's Kritik der Hegeischen Rechtsphilosophie is the major leitmotif of Hanaf?'s writings.22 Hanafi slightly rearranges the sentence to make it appear more antithetic, and he also interprets it in a way that distorts its original context but supports Hanaf?'s own thesis: religion is not reactionary as such but may also harbour revolutionary interpretations and traditions that can bring about political change. In the editorial in al-Tas?r al-Isl?mx Hanaf? sets out to discover the revolutionary potential of religion. First he states that religion as such means revolution. Muhammad and the prophets before him were revolutionaries: Ibrah?m revolted against shirk in the name of tawhxd, cIs? revolted against matter and materialism in the name of spirit, Muhammad led the revolt of the downtrodden in Mecca against the Quraysh nobility in the name of "liberty, equality and fraternity". Therefore they had to suffer persecution and death at the behest of the worldly rulers,23 whose vested interests they attacked. But the prophets were not only revolutionaries, they were also the "teachers (murabb?n) of mankind", a hint at Hanaf?'s understanding of Islam as the true Enlightenment. He alludes to Lessing's treatise Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts which he has translated and commented upon. Hanaf? interprets Lessing's triadic concept of religious history from Judaism via Christianity towards the religion of reason in the light of Muhammad cAbduh's superficially similar concept in Ris?lat al-Tawhxd. According to Hanafi, the final revelation of Islam corresponds to the natural religion of the Enlightenment philosophers because it provides mankind with an amount of rationality that renders any further revelation superfluous.24 Hanafi discovers revolutionary tendencies not only in the Islamic heritage but also in other religions. He cites the rebellion of Bar Kochba against Roman oppression, Thomas M?ntzer as the leader of the sixteenth century's peasants' war in Germany, the "revolutionary priests" in Latin America, but also Mao and Ho Chi Minh as revolutionary 22 Al-dxn ajy?n al-shdb wa-sarkhat al-mudtahad, e. g. viii.178 al-tanw?r al-dxn? wa-l-tanz?m al siyas?, 1976. 23 Note the deviation from traditional Islamic prophetology. 24 viii.58f yas?r, vi.265 s?ra; vii.l57ff m?dh? tdn?: ashhadu all? il?ha ill? l-Ll?h; 1.17, apu ff., IV.Ill, 5ff., V.419; cf. also his annotations to Lessing pp. 206, 209ff., 305; "intervista" p. 71; cf. cAbduhpp. 448ff.</page><page sequence="8">70 MARTIN RIEXINGER Confucians and Buddhists! In addition he invokes a variety of political movements from the history of Islam like the Qarmatians, the Sudanese Mahdi and the zanjP But for him the main source for a revolutionary interpretation of Islam is to be found in its theological, philosophical and juridical doctrines. In his attempt to reinterpret tur?th, Hanafi" divides it into different branches, in each of which he singles out "leftist" and "rightist" schools of thought. He pays most attention to the field of theology, where he strictly opposes "rightist" Ash'arism "firqat al-sult?n" to "leftist" Mutazilism, "the open opposition from the inside". The "Islamic Left" ought to be a "radical Muctazilite movement".26 Hanafi criticizes Ash'arism, above all al-Ghazal??allegedly its foremost representative?for defending the belief in miracles, which according to Hanafi wrought havoc on science and rationality and thus initiated the decline of the Islamic world. Furthermore, he holds the doctrine of khalq al-afi?l responsible for the passivity prevailing in the Muslim societies.27 In reverse, he praises Mu'tazilism for promoting activism by defending free will, and for stimulating rationalism and scientific inquiry by stressing causality of natural processes. Hanaf? equates cad?la, one of the five principles of Muctazilism to social justice. Al-khayr wa-l-sharr al- aqliyy?n, allegedly also standing for one of five principles (sic, actually replacing the manzila bayn al-manzilatayn), appear as antidote to scrip tur alism.28 Hanafi interprets the Muctazilite doctrine o?al-aslah in a way that clears God of any responsibility for evil. The present deporable state of affairs is to be considered manmade and hence removable by political action. In other places he reformulates the doctrine of al-aslah as a duty to improve the world through a revolution for the poor.29 He praises the physical theories 25 viii.60f.j?zw. 26 viii.l8ff.j&gt;;?wor, on the three types of opposition and the firqat al-sult?n: V.328n279, V.420-461.; The reappraisal of Mu'tazilism can be traced back to Muhammad Abduh.

Ashras and al-J?hiz30 for denying the existence of independent accidents. He often invokes their concepts in the defense of Marxist materialism, or he proposes their "naturalism" as an authentic alternative to Western materialist concepts, for example in the refutation of al-Naza'?t al-M?ddiyya fix l-Falsafa al-Arabiyya al-Isl?miyya by the Communist Party of Lebanon central-committee member Husayn Muruwwa.31 Hanafi awards political relevance to the struggle against anthropo morphism which he equates with Ashcarism. He condemns the equation of God and worldly rulers as a justification for exploitation and for authoritarian political systems. Hanafi describes the behavior of worldly rulers by alluding to the asm?3 husn?: the ruler is rich (Ghanx) and donates generously (Mufx, Wahh?b). Ordinary men appear as humble petitioners towards both God and the rulers, although they should claim their rights from the capitalist system with self-confidence. Therefore Hanaf? rejects the "hierarchical worldview" of traditional religion by denouncing the idea of God as supreme mover beyond this world as a product of capitalism, designed to inculcate the opinion that worldly affairs are beyond control and unchangeable.32 Hanafi recommends Kh?rijism, the "opposition from outside", and Shiism, "the under cover opposition from inside" as further alternatives to Ashcarism without delving into details. The appraisal of Shiism is a reflex of the "Great Islamic Revolution in Iran", whereas the Kharij?s are described as exponents of revolutionary egalitarianism.33 Contrary to what might be expected from an Islamic reformer, Hanafi does not consider medieval Islamic philosophy as such as progressive. He praises a rationalist current beginning with al-Kind? and reaching its zenith with Ibn Rushd. But he rejects the illuminationist concepts of al-F?r?b? and Ibn S?n?. Hanafi attacks the neo-Platonic concept of a hierarchical state governed by a ra*?s mulham and he disapproves of any 30 This designation is false cf.

Combined with a preference for speculation over action, he holds these concepts responsible for the passivity and the neglect of the real world prevailing among contemporary Muslims. His siding with Ibn Rushd in philosophy is due to the latter's criticism of al-Ghaz?lL Ibn Rushd's physical theory is described as another equivalent of materialism and is therefore used in the defense of Marxism.34 By rejecting Ibn S?na in favour of Ibn Rushd Hanaf? diverts markedly from a Marxist school of thought (Engels, Bloch, Ley, T?zin?, Muruwwa) which considers both as precursors of European rationalism and materialism.35 On the other hand Hanafi does not fall prey to the dilemma of other neo-Averroists who simultaneously stress Ibn Rushd's relevance for Western science and rationalism and his accordance with orthodoxy by referring to those theological writings that do not openly contradict widely accepted Islamic doctrines but were irrelevant for the intellectual development of Europe.36 Another idea of Ibn Rushd that plays a major role in Hanaf?'s specialist writings is the denial of an individual afterlife, to which he opposes worldly salvation. But in his articles for dailies and magazines he refers to this aspect only once. There he declares that the only possible form of afterlife consists of the effects of one's actions and the memory one leaves in the collective mind of fellow men. The closest parallel in the Islamic heritage is the doctrine discussed in Ibn Rushd's major commentary on de anima, according to which the individual soul merges with the active intellect after death.37 34 viii.21fj?w; against dualism: IV.463ff. 35 Von K?gelgen pp. 238ff.; Muruwwa vol. ii pp. 693-702 with some criticism of idealist elements in Ibn S?n?'s thought.

Ha nafi states that this school is based on the principle of maslaha mursala, which was formulated by al-Shatib? but which can be traced back to cUmar (i.e. his "nationalization" of the Sassanid domains).38 Moreover Hanafi defines tashft as human activity and al-Shatib? was the only classical jurist to express a similar opinion.39 Apart from his proposal to base legislation on maslaha, he joins in the reformist demand for the reopening of ijtih?d. The qualifications he demands for a mujtahid are low: a thorough knowledge of Arabic, a knowledge of the asb?b al-nuzul and the needs of the umma. The latter may again be a reflex of the thoughts of al-Shatib?, who declares the knowledge of the maq?sid al-shar( to be the main prerequisite for a mujtahid}0 Hanaf?'s dynamic concept of ijtih?d is completed by a dynamic concept of ijmtf which ought to change with every generation.41 Hanafi" also pays his tribute to the scientific achievements of medieval Islam and advocates a fresh spirit of scientific inquiry.

He judges cosmological theories not in respect of their scientific tenability but their ideological utility: "Which of the ancient theories is the most useful in order to claim back al-ara?

He favours a "thematical" tafslr, in which the teachings of the Qur'an on certain subjects are demonstrated by collecting the respective verses instead. This method of exegesis is to be the preparatory stage of a "tafslr of consciousness" containing a comprehensive, revolutionary Qur'?nic Weltanschauung.^ He argues with reference to the asb?b al-nuz?l that the message of the Qur'an deals with social reality but that it has to be reinterpreted45 because of changed circumstances. Hadlth is not rated very high by Hanafi". He only accepts mutaw?tir traditions. Moreover, the judgment on the taw?tur of ah?dlth has to be based on their accordance with reason, experience and the Qur'an, and not only on the reliability of their isn?d:46 This might be a reflex of al-Shatib?'s theory that all juridically relevant ah?dlth have a foundation in the Qur'an.47 Notably similar opinions were discussed passionately among the Ikhw?n al-muslim?n in the fifties.48 In Hanaf?'s eyes, a new kind of biography of the Prophet is also in demand, because the messenger's message has been submerged in the veneration of his person. This threatens to lead Muslims astray like the ahl al-kit?b, who adore the messengers instead of following the message. Therefore Hanaf? praises Wahh?bism (allatl nasha'at fix l-Hxj?zl) for its struggle against the veneration of Muhammad.49 Hanafi 43 viii.25f?.yasar 44 Examples for tafs?r al-madm?n: against pr?vate property: vii. 121-45 al-m?lfi I-Qur'an (mal), 1979; English version: The Method of Thematic Interpretation of the Coran; on the evil char acter of Jews see pp. 84ff. Concerning tafs?r Hanafi does not name specific role models, but it is obvious that Sayyid Qutb's F? ?il?l al- Qur'an is the model for a revolutionary tafs?r, whereas the method of thematical interpretation has been formulated by al-Khul? (pp. 304ff.) and Mahmud Shalt?t, shaykh al-Azhar under Nasser: Zebiri pp. 15Off. 45 The particular stress on the asb?b an-nuz?l (also 1.19, apu f., 1.345, 9ff.) may also be due to the influence of al-Shatib? vol. ii. (347?F.); the reception of his theories in modern Islam deserves a closer examination: cf.

Therefore Hanaf? defends Salman Rushdie's right to deal critically with this issue.50 In the field of applied law Hanafi gives priority to social matters and jih?d instead of rituals and purity, which he underlines by quoting Khumayn?'s statement that "we are not the fuqaha' of menses and childbed". Hanafi does not elaborate a theory of jih?d but considers warfare legitimate and calls jih?d the "forgotten duty". In line with his general preference for the mu?mal?t over the cib?d?t, Hanafi redefines the pillars of Islam with an activist meaning: hajj ought to be an annual international Islamic conference, fasting teaches the satiated compassion with the hungry, zak?t does not mean almsgiving but collective ownership (ishtir?k al-m?t), prayer teaches a sense of the time, and shah?da does not mean to murmur a formula, but being aware of reality and the willingness to sacrifice oneself in the struggle against the idols (taw?ghlt) of a materialist, egotistical attitude towards life like money, social status and lust.51 In al-Tas?r al-Isl?ml and other writings dedicated to a wider public, Hanafi condemns mysticism because it teaches patience, passivity and withdrawal from the world at a time when activism is most necessary. In his attacks on mysticism he advocates Iqb?l's understanding of the Islamic message as an activist program of continual change against the attitude of leaving the world unchanged. As an antidote to the practical consequences of mysticism, especially the doctrine of the intercession of the shaykhs, he recommends neo-Hanbalite puritanism. Therefore he praises Wahh?bism as revolution against saint worship.52 Nevertheless, Hanafi partly exculpates mysticism as an understandable overreaction of the pious to the failure of the Alid revolution against 50 In the discussion following his speech: al-wahy wa-l-w?qi in Ad?ms et al.: al-Isl?m wa l-had?tha, pp. 234f. 51 viii. 2 7ff. yas?r, on jih?d as fonda gha?ba: I.30,-6f.; viii.295 sulta; on the shah?da vii. 15 If. m?dh? tdni ashhadu l? il?ha ill?

The inability to save the world led to the egotistical attempt to save oneself/one's soul (nafis). In writings not aiming at immediate political impact, Hanafi admits that mysticism may be a useful device to build a personal relationship with God. As such it might find its deserved place in a world that has changed for the better.53 Finally he uses the concept of wahdat al-wuj?d in the defense of Marxist materialism.54 Because Hanafi considers the message of Islam as thoroughly belonging to this world, he strictly opposes any speculation on supernatural and invisible phenomena. Instead, he favours "struggling for the people", which he legitimizes by almost identifying them with God.55 He accuses the capitalist system of reifying what is beyond perception in the material forms of maw?lid and sufi orders in order to let religion appear as self-sufficient set of ceremonies apart from social reality. Hanafi brands all forms of outward, ritualistic (shia'?'irl, mazharx) religion as "capitalist religion". With this he attacks phenomena that characterized the boom of popular devotion during the Sadat era, like mosque-building and religious festivals. According to him they are used by politicians and the upper-class to present themselves as pious Muslims and to divert attention from malpractice and the exploitation of the world's resources.56 But not only the rich are accused of exploiting religion for their purposes: The Egyptian state abuses the ordinary believer's blind reverence for the rij?l al-dln, although Islam disapproves of a clergy. Hanafi insinuates that both have struck a political bargain: the government protects vested interests of the ulam?' whereas they legitimize its policy with fiatw?s, peace with Israel included. Furthermore, the religious scholars play a major role in the defense of private property and the propaganda for a pro-Western alignment by preaching that 53 On Alid revolution also Hanaf?, Tur?th pp. 14, 185; vi.222 s?ra; for origin of this argu ment among the Ikhw?n: Mitchell p. 214; on "Western" materialism: viii.41 yas?r, positive evaluation of mysticism: Hanafi, Tur?th p. 187f, cf. also Von K?gelgen p. 211; to which ex tent Hanaf?'s concepts concerning "Sufi hermeneutics" can only be discussed when Akhavi (1997) p. 378 explains what that is supposed to mean in this context. 54 v\i.2^ tashw?h; Hanafi, Muqaddima pp. 177f. 55 v'?.33yam?n: "Allah wa-l-shdb sinw?n, l?yumkin tasawwur Allah bid?n umma"; Hanafi, "Th?ologie" p. 260; I.30,2f; Campanini p. 113. 36 vii.48ff. ra'sm?liyya; vii.253 al-wathaniyya al-jadxda, 1976; vii.267ff. dhahab al-maqs?ra ... wajawc al-fuqar?', 1978.</page><page sequence="15">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 77 the imperialist West may be rapacious and oppressive, but unlike the atheist East, at least respects religion.57 Anachronisms and Contradictions in Hanaf?'s Invented Tradition Anybody slightly acquainted with the political and intellectual history of Islam will be stunned at how easily Hanafi projects several currents, the actual relations of which were marked by deep enmity, back into the past as one "Islamic Left". The most striking example is the simultaneous appreciation of Muctazilism and Hanbalism.58 This does not result from a lack of knowledge of Ibn Hanbal's fate. Hanafi praises his steadfastness towards oppression, but suppresses the fact that this occurred during the mihna.59 Although no leading Muctazil? theologian took part in the persecution of opponents,60 the fact that Muctazil? doctrines were used for repression would hardly fit the democratic, freedom-loving image of Muctazilism which is designed by Hanafi. In the case of al-Ghaz?l?, Hanafi grossly exaggerates his occasionalism by taking the arguments from the 17 th chapter of Tah?fut alfial?sifia out of context and accusing him of teaching that the world is totally incalculable at any time.61 Furthermore he withholds the fact that al-Ghaz?lfs arguments belong to a tradition that started with the Muctazil? Abu Hudhayl.62 Nor does he mention al-Ghazal?'s opinion that anyone who sets out to ,7 vii.65f ra'sm?liyya; cf. Zeghal pp. 238ff. 58 Most Western authors neglect the Hanbalite influence on Hanafi whereas for his secularist critics in the Arab world it is a major bone of contention cf.

Moreover he and his collaborator Perler conclude that in the West occasionalism has played a decisive role in overcoming Aristotelian hyle morphism and thus paved the way for Hume's empiricism with its theory of causality as empirical regularities, ibid. pp. 257f. 02 vi.354 al-thawra al-mud?dda mu?mara istim?riyya, 1987; for the origin of the ^?/?-con cept: Van Ess (1966) p. 214 a now more detailed id. 1991?T.: vol. iv. , and Rudolph pp. 28ff.; for the problematic labeling of al-Ghaz?l? as "Ashcarite" see Frank pp. 15ff., 36ff., 95ff.</page><page sequence="16">78 MARTIN RIEXINGER defend cosmological doctrines that contradict mathematical proofs does a disservice to Islam.63 Occasionally Hanafi even pretends that there was a mihna against Mu'tazilism, and that al-Ghaz?l? refuted logics.64 The doctrines of the "leftist" Ibn Taymiyya on miracles, cosmology, the attributes of God as well as his attacks on logics ought to be considered even further "to the right" according to Hanaf?'s own criteria.65 In his writings, the relationship between Wahh?bism and the Saudi monarchy is conspicuous by absence. He considers the latter completely illegitimate and even writes 'Hij?z' where he lists contemporary states.66 Three factors account for Hanaf?'s selection from the Islamic heritage and thus for his anachronisms and ahistorical presentations: First of all, the choice of the currents which Hanafi discovers as the "Islamic Left" in the past is due to superficial parallels to those Western religious movements, philosophical doctrines and ideologies which he himself considers progressive. Mu'tazilism is frequently equated to European Enlightenment, in particular to the teachings of Spinoza,67 in spite of obvious differences like an immanentist versus a transcendentalist concept of God, or the Mu'tazilite concept of al-aslah (as understood by Hanafi) versus Spinoza's clockwork-like deus sive natura, the perfection of which may affect mankind quite negatively. In this context Hanafi makes use of widespread anachronistic clich?s in apologetical writing which let the Islamic past appear as an idealized anticipation of modernity. In spite of his outspoken elitism he describes Ibn Rushd as a popular orator who directed his enlightening messages to "the masses" of Cordoba: If Ibn Rushd ever preached to the masses it is likely that it 63 Tahqfut pp. 80, 84. Moreover he passes over the fact that the way for al-Shatibis maslaha-theory was prepared by al-Ghaz?l?'s concept of the maq?sid al-sharc: al-Ghaz?l?, Mus tasf?, vol. i pp. 283-315, al-Shatib?: vol. iipp. 8-12, 49-52, 176-180, vol. ivpp. 27-32, Hanafi ascribes them to al-Sh?tib? alone: Hanafi, "Buh?th" pp. 53f. or to M?likism as such (viii. 295 sulta); cf. Hallaq (1997) pp. 89f, 112f, 168ff. 64 viii.318 wahda, correct on his attitude towards logic: Hanafi, "Buh?th" p. 52. 65 A spot check at some Hanbal? essentials shows that this observation also applies to Min al-Aq?da il? l-Thawra with its extensive references as well: II.226?F. (wt?z'&lt;7:54 et al.&gt;), IV.148ff. {shaqq al-qamar), IV.41 Iff. ('adh?b al-qabr). At one place (V.550n363), he turns Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim into Ashcarites. In I.368,-7ff. he admits that there is a conflict between his own position on hadxth and the position of the salqfiyya. 66 iv. \ 51 haraka. 67 Hanafis translation of Spinoza's Tractatus theologico-politicus was not available to me.</page><page sequence="17">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 79 would have been that kind of corporealism and scripturalism that H anaf? rejects.68 The second factor is the influence of Latin-American liberation theology, with which Hanafi is thoroughly acquainted. In 1967, he wrote a biographical article on the Colombian priest Camilo Torres, who was killed after joining a guerrilla movement. He dedicated his edition of Khumayn?'s al-Huk?ma al-isl?miyya not only to cAl? Shar?'at? and the victims of the Shah, but also to the martyrs of the "religious revolution" in Latin America. The parallels are not restricted to the transformation of religious formulas into political slogans. Both Hanafi and the exponents of liberation theology advocate a this-worldly reinterpretation of religion to promote revolutionary change. Both attack the hierarchical clergy for forging the initially revolutionary message of the Scriptures into a conservative tool of repression. Both explicitly reject ("Platonic") body soul dualism, advocate a Unitarian vision of man instead and replace eschatological concepts by this-worldly salvation. The preference of orthopraxy over orthodoxy is a common clich?, but Hanaf?'s equation of the latter with social activism again betrays the influence of Latin American concepts. In accordance with them he replaces the concept of sin with that of social evils. For Hanafi as well as for liberation theologians, the interpretation of the Scriptures has to begin with an analysis of the social situation and the demands of "the masses". It therefore comes as no surprise that both are accused by their respective opponents of practicing eisegisis instead of exegesis.69 68 iii. 18al-judh?r al-ta'?khiyya lil-ghazw as-sahy?mfi l-tur?th al-islam?(ghazw), speech in Tunis 1984. This anachronism appears in an article where Hanafi sets out to prove that under Islamic rule Jews and Christians were treated as equal citizens. Thus Maimonides, expelled from his home town as a boy, appears as the second popular orator of the Andalusian metro polis; on the "Andalusian model" of coexistence of Muslims Jews and Christians also: J?bir?/ Hanafi, Hiw?r pp. 99ff.

In his articles Hanaf? never explains what God actually is. But in Min al-Aqlda il? l-Thawra he expresses a variety of opinions which betray the influence of various Western philosophical or modernist Christian theological doctrines: A deus sive natura like Spinoza's,70 a Hegelian God as consciousness of humanity in history,71 a Marxian alienated human self-consciousness thrown beyond this world72 or a purely cognitive principle that ought to be realized by revolutionary practice.73 This impersonal God does however communicate with mankind via revelation.74 Hanafi frequently describes revelation as merger of consciousness and reality, a product of reality and as a mission to fulfill,75 as a discourse and a work of art (khalq fiannx) and he stresses that it is identical with reason,77 but he never bothers to explain how the revealed text has come into existence. Most likely this is not due to the fear of hostile reaction alone, but reflects the dilemma which most modernists are facing in a monotheist tradition: On the one hand he almost abolishes God, on the other hand the normative foundation of his project is "revelation" i.e. a text that, unlike the intellectual products of fallible humans, is beyond criticism. Thirdly, with reference to the antagonism between Ash'arism and Muctazilism, Tar?b?sh? has pointed to the fact that Hanafi promotes religious currents that play no role in modern Islam, or at least in contemporary Egypt. Therefore they appear as "magical crowbar" able to open the deadlock of a bleak reality.78 This also explains why al-Ghaz?l?, the most influential theologian of Sunni Islam, appears as personalized evil. This point, with which Tar?b?sh? deals only briefly, interpretation of scriptures according to the needs of the "masses": ibid. pp. 8ff., criticism of "eisegesis": ibid. pp. 22ff. and Ab?

(1991) pp. 227?T.</page><page sequence="19">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 81 will be discussed more extensively in the context of Hanaf?'s writings on the recent history of Egypt. Hanafi and Marxism Hanaf?'s "Islamic Left" is not a simple blend of Marxist and Islamic elements.79 He justifies his opposition to capitalism in a completely different way. Compared to Marx, Hanaf?'s notion of capitalism is ahistorical, non-economic and undialectic. It never appears as a progressive and necessary stage in the course of history. He excuses Marx's positive evaluation of the role of capitalist imperialism in the destruction of the "Asiatic mode of production" as a youthful fault resulting from lack of knowledge.80 He does not blame the logic of the system for the evils of capitalism. Instead he holds the neglect of timeless moral values responsible for these evils. His criticism of capitalism is, on the rhetorical level, directed against riba, usually usury, the "sphere of circulation", and not against the "sphere of production". Thus his arguments correspond formally to a criticism of capitalism that is widespread among Islamists as well as Western fascists.81 But when the content of the slogans is scrutinized more closely, differences become apparent. In Hanaf?'s texts the Qur'?nic term riba is not used to combat honest "productive" capitalism with "unproductive" financial operations. He defines rib? as "profit without work" and thus explicitly includes the profits resulting from the exploitation of labor into that notion.82 In his rejection of private ownership of the means of production, Hanafi also agrees with Marxism and differs from the majority of Islamists. He proves its illegitimacy by the means of tafslr al-madm?n with reference to verses which mention God, not men, as m?lik al-samaw?ti wa-l-ard. According to Hanafi", the Qur'an describes mal as that which belongs to God: He puts it at man's disposal in order to encourage production and to fulfill vital needs collectively (shuy?c al-amw?l), but not for 79 Cf. also Mugh?th passim. 80 vii.217, 219 tashw?h al-M?rksiyya, 1987 (tashw?h), revised version of an unpublished re sponse to attacks against the Tajammu-party by Ahmad M?s?

In his accounts of Western history, Hanafi hardly ever discusses events and developments beyond the realm of mere thought.85 When he deals with the history of Islam, he explicitly rejects any consideration of social and economic factors relevant to the development of thought. Hanafi justifies this neglect with the assertion that Islamic civilization is determined by revelation.86 Whereas Hanafi strictly opposes the separation of substrate and accident in metaphysics, Islamic thinkers appear as mere substrates to which the accident "thought" merely subsists.87 According to him, Islamic history is the result of the attempt of Islamic thinkers to direct society according to revelation. Thus, the Islamic world of the past appears as socialist utopia where revelation made Islamic scholars and rulers aware of social justice and the demands of the poor. They passed rulings and took decisions in their favour, like the confiscation of excessive riches or the ahk?m al-s?q.m His refusal to look into social history allows Hanafi to project anachronistic political concepts into Islamic history: Sal?h al-D?n does not appear as the commander of an efficient professional 83 vii. 123fF., 135ff., 141,145 mal; nowadays he uses the same verses to legitimize environ mentalism: On the Thematical Interpretation of the Coran, p. 209. 84 i. 157 muqawwim?t. 85 Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 77,15ff. 86 Hanafi, Tur?th pp. 95ff.; see also Hartar pp. 124ff. andJunVapp. 137f., 143ff. 87 Hanafi, Tur?th p. 89: lil-fikr mas?ruh?fi l-ta'?kh, wa m? l-qfr?d ill? haw?mil lahu; viii.248 al-dxn wa-1-tur?th wa-l-thawra, 1985; criticized by Ab?

In the case of Schulze it is a further proof for the paucity of reading on which his far-reaching conclusions are based. However with regard to their relentless reinterpretation of terms until they fit their own purposes (Radtke 2000), Schulze and Hanafi show a striking similarity that produces even more strik ing dissimilarities en d?tail. 88 On mus?dara: vii.225 tashw?h; vii. 197-202 ahk?m al-s?q, 1978, III.334,3ff.; when Western Orientalists like Bernard Lewis dare to challenge such an opinion by writing on slavery and racial prejudice in the Islamic World, this is an obvious part of the Zionist con spiracy against Islam: m.28 ghazw.</page><page sequence="21">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 83 army but as modern nationalist leader, mobilizing "the masses" against the Crusaders and their Fatimid collaborators.89 The rejection of the materialist and "Darwinist" Marxism of the 19th century leads Hanafi to a high esteem of European intellectual Marxisms, which restored the realm of ideas to its well-deserved place. Furthermore he appreciates the theoretical adaptation of Marxism to the conditions of non-industrialized countries by Lenin and Mao.90 In Hanaf?'s eyes, revolutionary change in the pre-industrial Islamic world with its uneducated masses cannot be brought about by the working class, but only by intellectuals and officers.91 Although no influence of Maoist theory is apparent in his thought, he refers in some writings to the "east wind" concept of his friend Anwar cAbd al-Malik, according to whom revolutionary China will lead the revolt of the whole non Western World against both "Western" political systems, capitalism and Soviet communism.92 Hanafi explains away Marxist atheism in the same way as Western criticism of religion in general and, as already mentioned, he defends Marxist materialism with reference to various "materialist" concepts in the Islamic heritage. In this context Hanafi insists on the differentiation between the terminological and the colloquial understanding of materialism, of which he himself makes use in his criticism of the "West".93 Hanafi counts Marxism as one of the four "national currents" in Egypt. He praises the Egyptian communists for their achievements in organizing workers and students and for their courageous struggle against the British.94 Nevertheless, Hanafi considers the implementation of Marxist-Leninist politics in Islamic countries disastrous. His opinion is based on personal experiences in Afghanistan, where he had observed 89 viii.218 mashrd jar?da isl?miyyayawmiyya, 1976. 90 vii.216, 230 tashw?h; vii.220f: Sartre, Althusser, Koj?ve and the "Frankfurt school"; Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 31 If. 91 ii.277 m?dh? l-tanw?r, 1981; Hanafi, Tur?th p. 65. 92 viii. 12yas?r, Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 41, lOff., p. 531, 1 if.; For the ideas of this Cop tic writer and former Marxist critic of Nasser, who currently advocates an eclectic mix of Maoism, Third Worldism, Nasserism and Islamic revivalism, see his article "R?h al-sharq" or Boullata(1992)pp. 92ff. 93 vii.217ff. tashw?h; viii. 178 al-tanw?r al-dxn? wa-l-tanz?m al-siyas?, a reference to Engels's positive judgements on various religious traditions; materialism as egotism and hedonism opposed to Islamic idealist collectivism e.g.: v\\\A\?yas?r. 94 viii.66jyaw.</page><page sequence="22">84 MARTIN RIEXINGER a tiny, culturally alienated minority imposing an agenda that the traditionally minded population of a pre-industrial society was not prepared to accept. Their resistance led to the Soviet invasion, which was even more devastating than the crusades of Western imperialism. In Min al-Aqlda il? I- Thawra, however, he himself proposes a revolutionary avant-garde party as the appropriate reformulation of im?ma in classical Islamic political theory for the present.95 Hanaf?'s Writings on the Jews and Judaism The analysis of Hanaf?'s writings on capitalism has already shown that he makes use of the rhetorical repertory of conservative anti capitalism. In Islam, as well as in the Western world, this kind of anti capitalism is almost always accompanied by the negative stereotyping of Jews as the ruthless force behind this system. This is also the case with Hanafi. With the exception of Yadlin, all Western authors pass over this disturbing aspect of Hanaf?'s uvre! Furthermore his attacks urge to question the alleged progressive character of his supposedly new hermeneutics of the Qur'an: His article "Hal yaj?zu sharcan al sulh maca Ban? Isr? il" in which he lashes out at Jews in general is one of the examples for tafslr al-madm?n. The article is conceived as a fatw?. Hanafi states that he just wants to address the problem from a legal point of view. Moreover, it is exclusively based on the Qur'?nic statements on Jews.96 His intention is to counter the propaganda of the state-controlled media who depict Israel in a favourable light, as well as the opinions of "some of us" (authors and movie directors) who depict Jews as ordinary human beings, and not as "hooked nosed Shylock-like figures".97 Hanafi singles out all negative statements of the Qur'an on Jews. He particularly dwells on the accusation that they always rejected the 95 v. 28-43 al-Muslim?nfi?siy?, 1981, (?siy?); V.325,6ff.; also Akhavi (1997) pp. 379f. 96 iii.33 Ban? Israel. 97 iii.38 Ban?

It is derived from their role models, the rabbis (9:34). Therefore it is no accident that the Jews trade in gold or work as goldsmiths, moneylenders and bankers. Unsurprisingly they do not show any reluctance to take interest (5:161).100 Hanafi deals with Jews and Judaism also in another text, a speech held in Tunis in 1984 at a congress dedicated to the "Zionist Crusade against the Islamic Heritage". He begins with the observation that two tendencies are to be observed in Judaism, a universalist and a particularist one. The universalist tendencies may be seen in the teachings of the prophets and the Jewish philosophers. These tendencies have been preserved in Islam.101 During the centuries however, the other tendency has been more forceful. It found its expressions in two phenomena: the exploitation of other peoples' intellectual heritage, and the infiltration of their teachings with Jewish superstitions. The first example can already be observed in the Ancient Near East where the Israelites constructed their religion with elements stolen from the Ancient Babylonian mythology. This notwithstanding, they developed the concept that they were elected and hence deserve superiority.102 They rejected the teaching of the prophets who had come to admonish them, but afterwards they took every opportunity to distort these teachings. St. Paul infiltrated Christianity with this intention.103 Later, they tried to undermine Islam, initially by creating Shiism, then by introducing isr?'llly?t into the science of tafslr.104 In recent history they continued this policy: the main examples are Freemasonry and internationalist socialism. Freemasonry came into 98 iii.40ff Ban? Israel. 99 iii. 6lf.Ban? Israel, with reference to Qur'an 2.86, 44: 34ff., 23.35ff.; and iii.79 ibid. 100 iii.63 Ban? Isr?V. 101 iii.

Then it was hijacked by the Jews as a tool for destroying national identities by propagating cosmopolitanism and thus to further their own particularist agenda. Then they propagated socialism. By calling for universal brotherhood they could promote their own capitalist objectives even more effectively. In the Middle East Hanafi discovers a similar attempt in Bahaism "which discourages the Muslims from jih?d". Obviously Hanaf?'s scenario is far from original. Our "enlightened" Islamic thinker shows no reluctance to name his source: The Protocols of the Elders of ?ion.105 As the most evil device in the Zionist Crusade against the Islamic heritage he names the alleged key-position of Jews in Orientalism. They control the major research institutes and use this opportunity to spread lies about Islam and to deny its originality.106 However, in the context of contemporary Arab discourse his ideas may be regarded as relatively moderate. In other writings the "Andalusian model" has been proposed as a solution to the Palestine conflict. The main objective should be to regain Palestine for the Palestinians. After that the Jews could live there as citizens with equal rights and a fertile cultural synthesis could come into being again.107 Ironically, he received scathing criticism for such a proposal in a tone closely resembling his own invectives presented above.108 "East" and "West" in Hanaf?'s Writings According to Hanafi, Western civilization derives from four sources: Judeo-Christian, Greco-Roman, Ancient Eastern and the "barbarian milieu". Whereas Western scholars acknowledge the first two sources, a conspiracy of silence led to a denial of the latter two. This insinuation does not keep Hanaf? from proving the influence of the Ancient 105 iii.25ff. ghazw.

Whereas the Ancient Eastern influence entailed purely positive consequences (including Eastern polytheist cults in Rome), the Judeo Christian and the Greco-Roman heritage are to be considered ambivalent, whereas the effects of the "barbarian milieu", i.e. Celtic and Germanic tribalism combined with the negative effects of Europe's bad climate, are condemned. Roman imperialism, combined with the Jewish concept of the chosen people and racism originating from Germano-Celtic tribalism laid the foundations of Europe's aggressive expansionism. He sees in barbarian tribalism, which imbued every European nation with a spirit of superiority, the cause of the cruelty that marks the history of Europe.109 Besides racism and materialism, individualism and egotism distinguish the West from the idealist and collectivist East.110 Hanafi holds Western imperialism responsible for an insurmountable enmity between the peoples of the "East" and those of the "West". This conflict predates the advent of Islam. Its origins are to be seen in the conquest of Palestine by the Israelites, Alexander's conquests and Roman imperialism: Hanafi calls Augustine an agent of Roman imperialism fighting Donatism, an African liberation movement. With reference to Hanaf?'s labelling of Greek antiquity as "Western", Tar?b?sh? rightfully dismisses this projection of the opposition between "East" and "West" back into the past as pseudo-revisionist, because Hanafi simply re-evaluates what Westerners have used to construct their identity, instead of scrutinizing its historical tenability.l ] ] Although Hanafi justifies his negative judgment of the West by referring to its conquering nature, a closer look at his writings shows that this is not based on a condemnation of conquests as such, but on the fact that the wrong conquerors were more successful: Of course he 109 Hanaf?, Muqaddima pp. 81-111, esp. p. 104, 1. 6ff.; conspiracy of silence: p. 109, 1. lOff.; Judeo-Barbarian merger: p. 107; in the elder version viii.32f.yas?r, the Ancient East does not yet play any role; iii.8ff ghazw on Ancient Eastern influence on the Old Testament; if Western scholars trace back Qur'?nic stories to the Bible it is ink?r al-wahy. iii. 24 ghazw; furthermore Hanafi sympathizes with Afrocentrists like Martin Bernai who names Hanaf?'s friend cAbd al-Malik as a supporter of his project (p. xxiii). Hanafi refers to his "Black Athena" in Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 483; on Bernai see Lefkowitz, Roth. 110 ii.204 taharrur al-aql al-arab?, 1977; Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 519. 111 Hanafi, Muqaddimapp. 102, -4ff, 551, 4ff.; Tar?b?sh?(1991) pp. 193f; cAl?Harb quot ed by Hildebrandt pp. 56f</page><page sequence="26">88 MARTIN RIEXINGER generally approves of Islamic conquests. The best example is an article about Islam in South Asia, where he replaces the white man's by the Muslim's burden: The Muslims rightfully conquered and united the subcontinent in the name of tawhld and began to convert the Buddhists, Brahmins (sic) and Hindus who evidently lack the right to cultural authenticity. Movements of any non-Muslim population directed against Islamic rule are therefore generally considered illegitimate. When he condemns British imperialism in the South-Asian context, he does not charge it of exploiting India and suppressing its people, but merely of depriving Islam of the opportunity to complete the conversion of its population to Islam. By inciting the Sikhs against the Muslims (sic), appeasing the Hindus with the partition of the subcontinent (sic) and through the integration of Kashmir and the "independent Islamic state of Hyderabad" into India, in which the Muslims had become a minority (sic), the British completed the defeat of Islam.112 Nevertheless, Hanaf?'s condemnation of the "West" is neither absolute nor does he deal with the "West" as a homogenous block. He distinguishes markedly between various countries. Apart from Israel the Anglosphere is treated with the least favour. Hanafi does not only reject British imperialism and American support for Israel, Sadat and the Shah, he also disapproves of the thought of the anglophone world because of its tendency towards sensualism and empiricism.113 He judges France and especially Germany more favourably. He praises German idealism and nationalism as models for the Islamic world. In the tradition of Arab nationalists like al-Husr?, he declares himself indebted to Fichte "faylas?f al-ard al-muhtalla" whose Reden an die deutsche Nation he frequently refers to. The parallels of thought are unmistakable: both deplore the fragmentation of their respective communities and accuse the elites of their societies of abandoning their authentic culture for fashionable foreign values and modes of behaviour. Both plead for economic autarchy and denounce universalist ideologies.114 But in his admiration for German 112 iv. 65ff. ?siy?. Whereas the fact that the partition of British India was a Muslim de mand can be considered as generally known, it seems necessary to note for the sake of his torical accuracy that the defeat of the Sikhs by the British in 1846 enabled the Muslim popu lation of the Punjab to practice its religion properly. The Muslim dynasty in the princely state of Hyderabad ruled over a Hindu majority of 88%. 113 vi.260.yfra. 114 Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 243f; i. 142 muqawwim?t; vi.211 s?ra, on the German model</page><page sequence="27">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 89 nationalism Hanafi never goes as far as showing sympathy for Nazism or Arab movements with fascist tendencies like Misr al-fat?t.U5 Hanaf?'s negative judgment of the contemporary West, and particularly the Anglosphere, cannot be traced back to negative personal experiences. In this respect, the Western countries are judged much more favourably than the Islamic societies. Sometimes he even becomes euphoric, for example, in his account of the achievements of a free press and its courageous representatives in the Watergate affair, or in his description of the BBC as "the pulpit of the people".116 When Hanafi deals with the relationship between the "East" and the "West", he follows two different concepts: an "ex oriente lux" theory and a historicist117, morphological concept of "East" and "West" developing in opposing cycles. Both concepts are, however, not clearly kept apart. Sometimes both of them appear in the same article or even intermingle from sentence to sentence.118 In an obvious response to the tendency to find non-Islamic roots for all aspects of Islamic civilization, the ex oriente lux theory traces every positive phenomenon of Western civilization back to Eastern roots: in the Middle Ages Islamic philosophy was taught in universities which were designed after Islamic models the West had come to know during the Crusades. The influence of Islamic rationalism paved the way for in general; Hanafi, "Berlin" p. 105; Fichte (1978) pp. 8ff., 22ff., 57f., 82f, 172; Al-Husr?; Cleveland pp. 85ff., 140f, 180); Tibi(1987)pp. 113-189, (1997) pp. 116-52; on the influence of Fichte on al-Arsuz?: Carr? pp. 45, 54. One might tend to think that Hanaf?'s appraisal of Fichte's nationalism is due to the fact that Germany as well as Egypt confronted the evil "West" in the person of Napoleon. But with whom Hanafi sides in Western thought and history is as contradictory as in the Islamic heritage: the admirer of Fichte also praises Napo leon: Jabir?/Hanaf?, Hiw?r p. 100; Hanaf?'s simultaneous admiration for Luther and Thom as M?ntzer may be cited as a further example. 115 Hanafi distances himself from his sympathies for the Axis as a small boy: I.46n; on Misr al-fat?: i.20fi l-thaq?fa al-wataniyya, 1980. 116 vi. 26\ s?ra. 117 In the sense of Popper's The Poverty of Historicism, where the epistemological fallacies and political dangers of this kind of ideologies are treated in full.

Only in 1992 al-S?q?, London, has published translations of Popper's essay as Bu 's al-?dxyulujiyya. NaqdMabda''al-Anm?tfi I- Tasawwural- Ta 'r?kh?, Hannah Arendt's On Violence as "Fi l-cUnf ' and Isaiah Berlin's "Two Concepts of Liberty" as "Hud?d al-Hurriyya". 118 The most striking example: viii.36ff.jyow.</page><page sequence="28">90 MARTIN RIEXINGER Reformation. The deep impact of Islam on Protestantism cannot be overlooked: both refute saint-worship, intercession and the clerical monopoly to interpret the scriptures. Above all Luther (wrongly alleged to be versed in Arabic) promoted the Islamic principle sola scriptura (he passes over the latter's rather "Ashcarite" sola gratia and sola fide).U9 Enlightenment appears as a transfer of basically Islamic rationalist principles: Hanafi compares the historical-critical study of the Bible to cilm al-hadlth and he labels the philosophy of religion since Spinoza a belated offshoot of Muctazilism.120 In this context, Hanafi uses cAbd al-Malik's term "civilizational surplus value". In the light of this theory the achievements of Western civilization are to be considered as results of the accumulation of profits from an imperialist exploitation that was not restricted to the field of economy.121 By ascribing inventions and scientific discoveries collectively to "East" or "West" and not to individuals, Hanafi stresses the right of Easterners to reclaim the scientific achievements of the "West": "Now as we physically exist among the applied inventions of the West, we are harvesting the fruits of a tree in the planting of which we have taken part".122 In the case of Islamic civilization Hanafi denies any external influence. He admits that the terminology of Islamic philosophy has been borrowed from the Greek tradition, but he considers this a "pseudomorphologie" (tashakkul k?dhibl, correct would be "pseudo-morphose"), because the terms are supposed to mean something completely different.123 119 J?smaft, Muqaddima p. 167ff., esp. 168,-10f. 120 vi?.38j?w; Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 92, -8f., p. 445, -13ff.; further examples pp. 544ff.; Lessing p. 313.; criticized by al-c?lim pp. 17 If. 121 Boullata(1992)p.95f. 122 ii.257 al-aql al-'arab? wahdahu l-q?dir'ala suri al-mu'fiz?t, 1980; Hanafi, "Berlin" p. 106; With his thoroughly essentialist description of the West and Islam and, on the other hand his appraisal for Said's attacks on Orientalism, Hanafi provides a good example for the selective reception of the latter in the Arab world cf.

Hanafi dismisses European criticism of religion for Islam: The denial of God's existence is an understandable overreaction towards clericalism and irrational anthropomorphism in Christianity. But that the Bible is not to be held true was not discovered by Spinoza, Voltaire and Strau? first, but can already be read in the Qur'an and the works of Ibn Hazm, al-Ghaz?l? and Ibn Taymiyya.124 Because of the rational and secularist character of Islam, the political model of laicism/secularism ?almanxyya) is superfluous: Where there is no church with priesthood, it cannot be separated from the state. Apart from this, the rational revelation of Islam allows Islamic civilization to remain centripetal (markazx), contrary to the centrifugal (tardx) Western civilization.125 Anyhow, religions in other parts of the World are rather counterparts of ideologies in the West.126 Hanaf? accuses Levantine Christian intellectuals lacking firm roots in Islam as a religion and civilization of spreading the idea of a separation of politics and religion in Egypt.127 His arguments from the apologetical tradition fail to convince secularist critics who consider them a contradiction to his objective of constructing a religious ideology or consider them illogical and ahistorical nonsense resulting from a "thought-strike" (idr?b can al-tqfklr).m The cyclical model, reminiscent of Ibn Khald?n, as understood by Hanafi129 and Spengler ("Decline of the West", insimultanous analogies) presents the development of the "West" and the "East" as adverse minology, he means something completely different; cf. Spengler pp. 784ff.; On the denial of external cultural influences (tatahhuriyya thaqqfiyyd) also Tar?b?sh? (1991) pp. 189ff., 199ff.

The climax of one civilization coincides with the other's awakening from its nadir.130 In this concept, the "West", identified with Christianity, is the model prefiguring the development of the East. Its development starts with an upward movement from AD 1 until about AD 400, when decline set in with the establishment of Christianity as a state religion. The curve crosses the x-line with the coronation of Charlemagne and reaches its low-point at about 1200, when scholasticism marked the beginning of a period of revival with the study of Islamic rationalism (the second era of translations). The x-line is surmounted again at about 1600, when the Reformation laid the foundations for the Renaissance.131 After the Renaissance, Enlightenment paved the way for a new climax of Western civilization with German idealism. The contemporary Western world is described as being in a state of decline, comparable to the Mamluk age, because it has lost its rational foundations.132 This is reflected in the contemporary arts and in post-modern thought: music has become atonal and painting abstract, the nouveau roman and the movies of the nouvelle vague have given up the Kantian categories of time and space, deconstructivism (tafklkiyya) proclaims the "death of the author" and replaces him by impersonal discourses, Foucault is preoccupied with folly instead of reason.133 The development of Islamic civilization is described in a strictly analogous way. It began with a heyday during which the sciences flourished after the translation of the knowledge of Antiquity into Arabic (the "first era of translations"). But then the Islamic world took the fatal 130 Hanaf?, Muqaddima pp. 496ff.; Hildebrandt pp. 29ff.; Campanini pp. 118ff.; accord ing to Chartier p. 610, Hanaf? has been propagating this concept in his lectures since the early 1970s. 131 Hanafi states that he insisted on this periodization even in his Ph.D.-exam: Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 171 n261. In the historical part of the "Muqaddima ? 'ilm al-istighr?b" Hanafi notably places Renaissance in the 15th and Reformation in the 16th century, according to the convention. 132 Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 434, -3ff.: uAl-wdy al-urubb? al-?nyamunru bi-fitrat al-asr al-mam l?kx al-turk?,y?jadu min 'adm,yaedam bu'd wuj?d li-had?rat al-markaz.

The Wahh?b? struggle against saint worship is described as the Islamic religious reformation that will lay the basis for a renaissance.135 A third era of translations, which began with al-Tahtaw?, al-Afghani and Shibl? Shumayyil has laid the foundation for a renaissance of the East.136 His hope for a cultural and political renewal of the Islamic World, resulting from a religious reformation, accounts for the deliberate false dating of Renaissance and Reformation in the West and the doubtful causal connection. Hanafi admits that he borrowed this comparative vision of the development of Islam and the Western world with the stress on the need for an Islamic reformation from his role-model al Afgh?n?.137 Preliminary Conclusion Up to now, Hanaf?'s project has presented itself as an inconsistent assemblage of heterogeneous ideological elements which he never tries to systematize. Tar?b?sh? has pointed out that Hanaf?'s writings are characterized by two different aspects: a critical or compensatory (tarmlmx) view of Islamic culture and history, and a megalomaniac (tdzlml, caz?3imx) or twaddle (hidh?T) discourse, an uncritical and unreflected affirmation of Islamic identity.138 When Hanafi deals with the development of Islamic thought, he deplores that Ashcarism in the service of "the power" has suppressed rational thought in Islam. But men of power like Sal?h al-D?n and Mahmud Ghaznaw? are praised for their heroic conquests, notwithstanding their support for "conservative religion". Nevertheless, one cannot explain the inconsistencies in Hanaf?'s "heritage" discourse out of itself alone. It is essentially intertwined with 134 viii. 228 al-Isl?m wa-l-qarn al-kh?mis cashar. 135 viii.267ff. hiw?r hawla l-fikr al-islam?: "al-isl?h idhan short al-nahda"; ii.20If taharrur al-aql al-arab?, interview "Rawz al-Y?suf 1977;J?bir?/Hanaf?, Hiw?rp. 61f. 136 Hanafi, Muqaddima pp. 149, 496ff., 500ff. 137 Hanafi, Muqaddimap. 167n248; cf.

This becomes obvious if one studies his writings on Egypt's contemporary history and on the "Great Islamic Revolution in Iran", where many of the discussed elements will reappear. Revolution: Nasser Hanaf?'s writings about the contemporary history of Egypt deal with three major subjects: the presidents Nasser and Sadat, and with the "Islamic movement" with which both were at odds. In his account of Nasser's policies, Hanafi stresses the roots of the Free Officers in the "nationalist currents". Among those with inclinations towards the Ikhw?n he mentions Muncim cAbd al-Ra'?f and Kam?l al-D?n Husayn, but not Sadat. According to him, the supporters of the revolution among the population were mobilized by the Ikhw?n for mass rallies in the streets of Cairo.139 Hanafi praises Nasser's policies for two major achievements: the fight against imperialism, Zionism in particular, and the struggle for social justice. He enthusiastically refers to Nasser's liquidation of British rule and his relentless resistance to Zionism and Western block-building, which he countered by promoting Arab unity. He approvingly relates Nasser's posing as a new Sal?h al-D?n, uniting the Asian and the African wing of the Arab nation.140 But when Hanafi praises Nasser's pan Islamic activities, one looks in vain for the man in charge: Sadat.141 Nasser is not only exalted as an Arab and Islamic leader but as an outstanding Third World figure, with reference to his performance at the Bandoeng conference and his leading role in the non-alignment movement. When Hanafi himself pleads for non-alignment, he uses an argument Nasser had already used: the equidistance to the Eastern and the Western block corresponds to the struggle of the early Islamic umma against the Eastern and the Western super-powers of its time.142 Hanaf?'s own wavering between pan-Islamism, pan-Arabism and Third 139 iv. 1 Off. tanmiya. 140 viii.218 mashnt ja?da isl?miyyayawmiyya, 1976; J?bir?/Hanafi, Hiw?r p. 55; cf. for ex ample Youssef Chahine's movie al-N?sir Sal?h al-D?n; Sivan pp. 23-65. 141 iw.2^?tanmiya. 142 Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 502.</page><page sequence="33">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 95 Worldism, always based on Egyptocentrism, is an obvious reflection of Nasser's theory of the three circles (Arabic, Islamic and Afro-Asian) centered around Egypt.143 Hanafi also praises Nasser's struggle for social justice, the abolition of "feudalism" and the "Egyptianization" of enterprises. He quotes Nasser's justifications for these policies, which resemble his own economic ideas: 1.

Islam is a program for social revolution, not a solace for afterlife.144 Hanaf?'s reinterpretation of the hajj as an annual convention of Muslims from all over the world is a concept Nasser had already propagated in his Falsafat al-Thawra.145 Nasser's acolytes justified his socialist policies by praising him as a follower of the prophets, who were revolutionaries146, and above all the term "Islamic Left" is already to be found in Nasserist propaganda.147 Nevertheless, Hanafi mercilessly criticizes the failures and deficiencies of the Nasserist system. As the first major shortcoming he singles out the lack of democratic legitimacy. This point can be divided into two sub points: dictatorial political practice, including the suppression of every opposition, and lack of an autonomous mass support: the "Free Officers" took decisions for the welfare of the masses, who in return appreciated them, but because they received those favours by decree, they were not prepared to defend them when Sadat abolished them in the same way. The second major point is connected with the lacking mass support: the lack of an authentic ideology able to motivate the people. Although 143 v.3Asiya; Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 529, Iff. 144 iv.226-30,218 al-?mil al-dxn?; 231 n; similar iv. 115ff., 120 tanmiya. 145 cAbd al-N?sir (1962) pp. 72f. 146 Kassianpp. 259f, 270ff;YazbeckHaddadp. 32. 147 S?lih.

However, the largest part of the book consists of a vulgar materialist analysis of Meccan society and the conflicts in the first decades of Islam. See also: Kassian pp. 263f.

According to him, Nasser first took decisions by trial and error. His personal charisma alone was sufficient to gain mass approval. But when Saudi Arabia and Syria indulged in polemics against his "atheist communism" by appealing to conservative religious sentiments, Nasser had to refer to Islam in order to legitimize his regime with religious slogans. Moreover these arguments were not used consistently by Nasser: After the Communist-backed Q?sim had gained power in Iraq, Nasser indulged in polemics against him with the very same arguments which the reactionary forces had previously used against him.148 Religion: Hanaf? on the Ikhw?n and Sayyid Qutb For Hanafi the way out of this dilemma would have been closer cooperation with the Ikhw?n, whom he himself had joined in 1952,149 and with Sayyid Qutb in particular. Therefore he considers the reconciliation of Nasserism and the Ikhw?n, or of din and thawra, his main objective.150 He praises the Ikhw?n for a number of achievements: In their version of Islam, cleansed of the accretions of bygone centuries, he sees the signs of an ideology able to confront the contemporary Western ideologies on equal terms. Moreover, he describes the Ikhw?n as the first authentic mass movement in the history of Egypt. He praises the efficacy of their "hierarchical family system" in organizing mass resistance to imperialism. The combination of these two factors facilitated the emergence of a new kind of intellectual committed to tur?th, caring for the needs of the masses and speaking to them in a language they can understand. By attracting Islamic thinkers and activists from other parts of the Islamic world, like Abu 1-Hasan Nadw?, cAllai al-F?s?, Naww?b Safaw?, Mustafa al-Sib? i, Arafat and Boumedienne, they also made Egypt the core of 148 -v 222 al-amil al-dxni; similar viii.68f.yasar. 149 vi.21 In s?ra, before he was a Sacdist in the tradition of his family, vi.214. 150 viii.64f.j?zw; vi.200ff. haraka; Ab?

This generally positive assessment notwithstanding, Hanafi severely disapproves of other aspects of their ideology and their political methods. He condemns their anti-modernism and their "sexual worldview", which expressed themselves in the resistance to the emancipation of women promoted by Nasser in the Act of 1955, and their disdain for theatre, cinema and music. Hanafi blames these aspects of their ideology? in combination with the striving for power of the conservative wing of the Ikhw?n led by Hasan al-Hudayb? an ally of General Naj?b?for the final rift with Nasser. Hanafi praises Nasser's refusal to become h?kim bi-amr Allah by succumbing to narrow-minded demands like enforcing the veil or closing down theatres and music-halls.152 When Hanafi relates his youth, he mentions his participation in actions in support of imprisoned Ikhw?n but no hatred for Nasser, which suggests that Nasser's break with the Ikhw?n must have been a most serious disappointment for him.153 When writing about his studies in Paris, he states that his thoughts were with the Revolution. But this did not keep him from publicly questioning a delegation of Egyptian officials at the Sorbonne about the fate of the Ikhw?n and about the names of those who withheld information on such acts of injustice from the raW54 When Hanafi praises the formulation of a coherent ideology by the Ikhw?n he is referring to the writings of Sayyid Qutb. His study of Qutb is a contribution to the Markaz al-qawml lil-buh?th al-ijtim?ciyya wa if in?'iyy a. Although less a biography than an analysis of the development of Qutb's thought, Hanafi stresses the importance of the personal and historical background for the development of ideas in this particular 151 viii. 105ff.

Hanafi does not neglect the first phase. On the contrary, he stresses the importance of the young Qutb's aesthetic approach to the Qur'an in al-Taswlr al-Fannl fi I-Qur'an. By praising Qutb's early love lyrics, Hanafi implicitly criticizes the concentration of contemporary Islamists on the regulation of sexuality and gender relations.156 He also stresses the nationalist commitment of the young Qutb and the fact that he was in contact with almost all political movements and intellectual currents in Egypt, which distinguishes him from his own position later and the intolerant exclusivism of the recent terrorist groups (jama"at).157 In the description of the second phase Hanafi portrays Qutb as thinker devoted to the improvement of the fate of the poor. This led him to formulate an Islamic concept of social justice in al-Ad?la al-Iftima:iyya fi l-Isl?m and Mctrakat al-Isl?m wa-l-Ra'sm?liyya. Surprisingly, Hanafi refers only briefly to the relation between the Qutb's economic thought and Nasser's justifications for his socialist policies:158 Qutb legitimized the nationalization of basic industries with reference to the M?likite theory that maslaha in case of dar?ra urges exceptional interferences into property rights.159 But Hanafi disapproves of Qutb's defense of private property in general.160 The young Qutb's interpretation of tawhld, shah?da and hakimiyya are regarded by Hanafi as foundation for the "liberation of conscience" and the struggle against tyranny. He claims that Qutb's definition of hakimiyya contains no positive notion in the sense of "divine government" but only the rejection of tyrannical 155 v. 167 athar al-imam al-shahid Sayyid Qutb cala l-harakat al-dxniyya al-mucasira (Qutb), 1980; Salvatore(1995)p. 207. 156 v. 188 Qutb. In this context it is worthy to note that even in Ft /?flat al-Qur'?n Qutb begins the analysis of some s?ras with a praise of their rhythmical beauty: Qutb (1983) pp. 3404f. (s?ra 53), 3902f. (s?ra 89); for a general account of aesthetic approaches to the Qur'an: Kermani. However, his juxtaposition of fundamentalist legalists and those torn towards the Qur'an by its beauty is a misleading simplification as Qutb's remarks demonstrate. 157 vi 44 haraka^ v. 18If.

Hanafi condemns his attacks on secularist intellectuals of Christian origin163 and his refutation of "the West" which led Qutb to a rejection of all currents of Islamic civilization influenced by non-Islamic sources. By rejecting the heritage of Islamic philosophy and Muctazilism, Qutb deprived himself of the opportunity to bolster his own thought with a more solid foundation. The total rejection of Western culture caused him to refute achievements like enlightenment and freedom of thought.164 Hanafi explains Qutb's development from his "social" to his "philosophical" phase as a consequence of his incarceration after the break between Nasser and the Ikhw?n. This forced him to divert his attention from direct political action towards theory. Instead of paying attention to urgent social problems he decided to fight Westernization.165 This led him to the study of the works of Mawd?di, whose isolationism was to dominate his thought later.166 Hanafi completely rejects Qutb's thought in the "political" phase. But the refutation of his thought is mitigated by an exculpation of the person. He describes the negative development as the product of the "thought of the tortured" and accuses the political leadership:167 "The Egyptian Revolution is responsible for the development from the struggle between Islam and capitalism into the struggle between Islam and j?hiliyya.'''168 This argument fails to convince Hanaf?'s former student Abu Zayd. According to him Hanafi underestimates the internal logic of Qutb's 161 v. 195f, 200,209 Qutb: hakimiyya and shah?da; v.216: salb?, rafd li 'ub?diyyat al-bashar, not yet influenced by Mawd?di: v. 205. 162 v.219 Qutb; vii.283, 286f al-yas?r al-islam? mashru had?n, 1982 for "Majallat 15-21", Tunis. 163 v.202 Qutb. 164 v.l95fQ#?. 165 v.251 Qutb. 166 v.238ff.,252Qw#. 167 v.295 Qutb. 168 v.255 Qutb.</page><page sequence="38">100 MARTIN RIEXINGER thought, and moreover he fails to explain why similar ideologies were promoted or adopted by people not exposed to torture.169 Hanafi traces the later Qutb's hakimiyya theory back to Mawd?di, whose concepts he refutes, not only because of his preoccupation with formalities, his reactionary stance concerning women and his defense of private property.170 Above all, he rejects the "theocentrism" underlying Mawd?d?'s political thought because it contradicts his own pretension to transform theology into anthropology, according to which vox dei ought to be vox populi. Mawd?d?'s positive understanding of hakimiyya as the rule of God is therefore directed against any other form of government, tyrannical or not.171 Influenced by this conception, Qutb began to denounce every form of government which does not conform to his own concept of an Islamic order as j?hiliyya.172 In the footsteps of Mawdud?, it was logical to give up every notion of Islam that went beyond formalism and a static understanding of the sharfa. Qutb's struggle became a struggle of belief devoid of any social content.173 Hanafi considers this isolationist tendency of the later Qutb the main source of inspiration for the violent jam?'?t of the seventies.174 Treason and Punishment: Sadat and the jatna?t Whereas Nasser's regime appears in Hanaf?'s writings as a failure, although the honorable intentions of the leader may not be questioned, the reign of Sadat (thawra mud?dda, or even ridda) appears as a humiliating sell-out of Egypt and the darkest phase in the country's history.175 In 169 Ab?

Hanaf?'s criticism of Sadat's reign can be divided into the criticism of concrete political actions and a deeper-lying aspect: the misuse of religion to justify them. An extensive discussion of the first aspect is unnecessary. Obviously infxt?h and the pro-Western foreign policy culminating in the peace treaty with Israel could only be abhorred by Hanafi. On the other hand, the way in which Sadat exploited religion is the clue to Hanaf?'s heritage discourse which has to be considered an implicit criticism of that era: when Hanafi bashes al-Ghaz?l? he aims at Sadat. Hanafi rarely mentions the use made of these ideological elements by the regime, but for contemporary observers the allusions must have been obvious. In comparison with Nasser's "charismatic" leadership, Hanafi describes Sadat's leadership as "traditional". He accuses him of exploiting the patriarchal and authoritarian aspects of the Egyptian popular heritage by praising the akhl?q al-qarya and by styling himself as a traditional rural leader, "thus the ruler began to appear as tribal chief or ancient Hebrew patriarch". This orientation towards rural conservatism implied, according to Hanafi, the rejection of everything young and innovative.176 Hanaf?'s rejection of "conservative religion" refers to phenomena typical for the Sadat era. It is not difficult to see his refusal of illuminationist political concepts with a ra*?s mulham on top in connection with a president who used to justify his decisions with the formula: "ulhima /z".177 Hanaf?'s struggle against Ashcarism in favour of doctrines teaching the causality of natural processes has a point of reference in the propaganda of the regime. The president used to trace his success at the beginning of his tenure back to miraculous interventions of God. Legends witnessing the support of angels were woven after the Egyptian army had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973.178 The struggle against social evils was discouraged by the promotion of a fatalist world-view 17b viii. 158 mustaqbal Misr. 177 Hanafi, Tur?th p. 13; on Sadat: Abu Zayd (1994) p. 113. 178 iv.276 al-?mil al-dxn?; other examples: iv. 188 tanmiya; vi.63ff haraka.</page><page sequence="40">102 MARTIN RIEXINGER ascribing them to the will of God.179 Hanaf?'s agitation against the preoccupation with supernatural phenomena, diverting the attention from worldly affairs, aims at the TV sermons of Shaykh Shacraw?.180 Even his polemics against the import of scientific knowledge belong to this context. Sadat claimed for his government to be founded on "cilm wa lm?ri\ Hanafi rejects this slogan, because it implies a contradiction between science and religion. Moreover the respective propaganda associated knowledge with the "West" and belief with the "East", thus holding the Egyptian people back from being creative.181 The part of Islamic tradition of which the Sadat regime made the most extensive use was Sufism. The upsurge of splendid mawlids is not the only indicator for this. Sadat founded al-Majlis al-dl? li-shu3?n at tarlq?t and thus rendered the Sufi orders a tool of the regime.182 On the ideological level, Hanaf?'s opposition against the promotion of Sufism has to be seen in connection with the regime's obvious intention to keep people from revolting against economic hardship by propagating the quietist values of sabr and tawakkul.183 Moreover he claims that Sadat, who abused Islam for manipulating the Egyptian public, in his propaganda for the West gave up Islam for syncretism. He reports with disgust on the inter-religious center Sadat planned to set up in the Sinai, because this would mean propagating the reconciliation between Arabs and Jews and between "the peoples (shu(?b) and imperialism".184 In his articles written in defense of Marxism Hanafi denies the intention of promoting a foreign ideology, but he insinuates that the attacks on Marxism by the regime were directed against the idea of social justice as such.18^ 179 iv.269 al-?mil al-dxn?; iv. 172?T. tanmiya. 180 Jansen (1986) pp. 12 Iff; Hanaf? only criticizes his political function viii.303f kayfa yufakkir, Hildebrandt (p. 43nl73) reports that in a private conversation Hanafi declared al Sha'r?w? his main enemy. 181 iv.lQ4n. tanmiya; J?bir?/Hanafi, Hiw?r p. 73. 182 iv.33ff. tanmiya; this is not correct, the institution was already founded at the begin ning of the 20th century and continued to exist under Nasser cf.

He stresses that during the first phase of his reign, Sadat left religious propaganda to members of the conservative wing of the Ikhw?n, whom he had released from jail or allowed to return from exile. After their return they focused on Nasser-bashing. Above all, they propagated the opinion that the defeat of 1967 was the well-deserved punishment for the atrocities of Nasser's godless regime.186 In his criticism Hanafi does not explicitly refer to the economic ideology of the Ikhw?n, but for the contemporary observer their growing bourgeois outlook and the conservatism nurtured by their leaders during exile in Saudi Arabia could not be overlooked.187 In his writings Hanafi dedicates considerable space to the terrorist jamtf?t, in particular al-Jih?d al-Isl?ml, out of which the assassins of Sadat emerged. His judgment of them varied considerably. The fact that they are considered primarily disastrous in his studies on Qutb and Mawdud?, and in al-Tur?th wa-l-Tajdld but praised heavily in articles published two years later in his series for the Kuwaiti daily al-Watan can easily be explained by the political context: in 1980 al-Jih?d al-Isl?ml had not yet assassinated Sadat.188 Hanafi regards the jama?t a product of the isolationist thought of Mawd?d? and of Qutb in the last phase of his life.189 In his account of the fitna t?'ifxyya which marred Egypt's communal relations during the seventies, Hanafi condemns their intolerance and their violent methods. He contrasts their atrocities against the Christian minority with the national unity between Christians and Muslims during the Nasser era. Nevertheless, Hanafi holds two parties responsible for the fitna: On the one hand, he charges the jamtf?t with trying to enhance their popularity among the backward Muslim population of Upper Egypt by attacking wealthy Christians. Therefore he condemns the fatw? of cUmar Abd al-Rahm?n, which legitimizes the expropriation of Christians. On the other hand, he accuses Sadat of exploiting the situation by presenting himself to the West as the savior of the Christians from Muslim 186 vi.61f. haraka. 187 Kepelp. 105ff. 188 A similar conclusion by Zakariyya'pp. 78ff. 189 v.HO-54 Mawdud?.</page><page sequence="42">104 MARTIN RIEXINGER fanatism, and to the Egyptian public as a strong leader preventing a Lebanon-like civil war.190 This condemnation of the jam?'?t is replaced by approval when Hanafi refers to the assassination of Sadat. In this context he praises them as the executors of the people's will. He seems, however, not to be quite sure about the degree of popular acceptance. On the one hand, he stresses that they were inspired by the Islamic heritage and that they expressed themselves in fatw?s, a literary form the masses were acquainted with. On the other hand, he considers their doctrines extremist, preventing them from moving among the people "like a fish in water".191 Hanafi criticizes their preference for action in small elitist and hierarchical groups over mass mobilization, which made them fall prey to the "dialectic of all or nothing".192 Their legitimization of the murder with reference to Ibn Taymiyya's fatw? against the Mongols appears to him as insufficient qiy?s based on the analysis of contemporary events in the light of the past.193 But whatever his objections to their theoretical justification may be, he welcomes the deed. In Hanaf?'s description Sadat's funeral appears as final verdict on the traitor: Only the West and Israel attended (the funeral), represented by three former American presidents and Begin, who insisted on coming on the Sabbath in order to fulfill his duty towards a friend who had granted Israel its birth certificate and endowed it with a guaranty of survival. But (the funeral took place) in the desert of Egypt, without people, apart from the security forces. In this moment Egypt remembered the funeral of Nasser, five millions in Cairo, carrying the bier on their shoulders, tearing it out of each other's hands; and they laid him to rest in the presence of two comrades, a brother from Sudan and a son from Libya.194 According to Hanafi, the opposition against Sadat was not restricted to the jam?'?t, referred to as the legitimate heirs of the "Free Officers", but was shared by all "national currents".195 Nevertheless, only al-Jih?d al-Isl?ml was able to execute the people's will, because its adherents 190 vi.83?. haraka. 191 vi.201 haraka. 192 vi.l53f, \86ff. haraka; Hanafi, Tur?th p. 40ff.;J?bir?/Hanaf?, Hiw?r p. 36. 193 vi. 114-23 haraka, esp. 118; Jansen (1986) p. 166-82; on the importance of Ibn Taymiy ya as a role-model for contemporary Islamists: Nagel vol. ii pp. 109-142. 194 vi.94ff.

Thus, in the aftermath of Sadat's assassination Hanafi saw the jam?'?t as the avant-garde of a united front of the "national currents".196 The Way to Bandoeng leads through Tehran: Khumayn? as a New Nasser Hanafi hailed the "Great Islamic Revolution in Iran" with enthusiasm. Unlike other intellectuals in the West and the Islamic world, he did not disassociate himself from this euphoria later.197 Nevertheless his accounts of the revolution, which he partially witnessed, are not completely uncritical. First, he considers the revolution the foremost sign of a general awakening (sahwd) of Islam and a severe blow to Western impe rialism: The Great Islamic Revolution in Iran was the authentic indicator for the awakening of the Muslims and the appearance of Islam.... It broke out totally unexpected, when Iran was an oasis of security for the West in the region.... And it occurred after the largest experiment in Westernization in the region, according to which Iran was to become a part of Europe, in the way kh?dive Ismatl had tried to deal with Egypt in the last century.... (The revolution) has developed into the greatest challenge to the West and into the strongest pillar of Islamic identity as national identity and into the strongest affirmation of national independence against a Western policy of block-building and expansionism.198 1% vi.92f. haraka; Zakariyy?' considers this description of al-Jih?d al-islam? danger ously naive because Hanafi does not consider their antidemocratic objectives exposed in al-Far?da al-gh?iba (pp. 8 Iff.). For Zakariyy?5 the assassination of Sadat was an attempt to assassinate modernity as such, including "Hasan Hanafi as he expresses himself in other articles" (p. 94). 19/ Those who come forward with this assertion give no reference from Hanaf?'s writings: Von K?gelgen p. 207; Hildebrandt p. 12; cf. the continuing positive evaluation Hanafi, Muqaddima pp. 528,-5ff. (on wil?yat al-faq?h), 548, 12ff.; with some good will a dissociation could be seen in a statement in "intervista" p. 78, but the interview addresses a European audience, and Hanafi criticizes the Ayatollahs' old fashioned beards, not the persecution, torture and murder of political opponents and religious minorities.

Therefore: "The road to al-Quds leads through Tehran".199 In his accounts, Hanafi stresses the similarities between Nasser and Khumayn?, one time even calling the im?m a "new Nasser". In this respect his posi tion differs markedly from the Ikhw?n, who equated Khumayn?'s struggle against the Shah with Qutb's struggle against Nasser. Hanafi justifies this equation by describing Khumayn? as Musaddiq's heir.200 He even goes one step further by presenting the Iranian revolution as a superior alternative, devoid of the crucial deficiency of the Nasserist system: the non-existent mass basis. In his account the Islamic revolution is characterized by a complete merger of leadership and masses.201 Hanafi is less euphoric about the ideological aspect of the revolution. He mentions the efforts of Sharfat? and Ban? Sadr to formulate a revolutionary ideology but does not delve into details.202 Sometimes he considers Shiism as such a revolutionary movement. But hardly anywhere is Hanaf?'s "almost infinite ability to contradict himself more apparent than in his foreword to the Arabic translation of Khumayn?'s al-Huk?ma al-islamiyya. He first praises the concept of effective leadership by alluding to al-F?r?b?'s virtuous city.203 Later on, he criticizes Khumayn? for a concept conceived from top to bottom and thus resembling the authoritarian models of early modern political thought in the West and the reality of the Arab military regimes.204 He first praises Khumayn? for refraining from an explicitly Shiite argumentation and for appealing to the common Islamic heritage instead. Then he criticizes the obvious influence of Shiite metaphysics on his concepts, like the idea of the Twelve Imams and Fatima as pre-existing lights revolving around the Throne of God.205 199 v.15 Asiy?; iii.331f. thawra ?raniyya; for a similar slogan concerning Cairo among the Free Officers: Jansen (1997) p. 125.; the Ikhw?n did praise the anti-imperialist aspect of the revolution in a similar fashion Akhavi (1990) p. 146. v. \5f.?siy?; Matthee p. 268; Akhavi (1990) p. 148. v. 12 Asiy?. iii.33 If. thawra ?raniyya; Hanafi does not know Farsi: viii.296 al-yas?r as-isl?mx l?yatlubu 200 201 202 l-sulta preface to Khumayn? p. xii. preface to Khumayn? p. xxvii (on Machiavelli and Hobbes nl4). preface to Khumayn? p. xxv ff.</page><page sequence="45">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 107 Hanaf?'s ambivalent attitude towards the specifically Shiite elements in the Islamic revolution corresponds to the attitude of the Ikhw?n: both were surprised that it took place in Iran, whose Shiism both had previously considered the product of a Judeo-Persian conspiracy against Islam.206 On the other hand it is worth mentioning that the issue of taqrlb between Sunnism and Shiism was supported by the Nasserist regime.207 Hanafi defends the revolution against the attacks in the Egyptian media, which exploited the lack of knowledge about the different branches of Shiism by ascribing ghul?t views like hul?l to Iran's Im?mls. But instead of demonstrating that the accusations are wrong, he stresses that the Iranian culam?} are just about to return to common Islam by wiping out innovations.208 Nevertheless, Shiite popular devotion had obviously shocked him: ... and in Qumm the poor-, men, women and children- are crowded around the rauda muhtarama, the grave of Fatima the daughter of M?s? b. JaTar, and they ask the people: "What is more honorable, all the gold, silver and crystal in the dome and the donations on the holy grave, or feeding, clothing and sheltering the poor?" Underdevelopment does not consist of poverty alone but of all the mental and psychological structures causing it and other evils. But the men and women cry and beg for baraka by striking its brass and its iron fence.... Then they leave as if their problems were solved. It seems as if the revolution cannot succeed without repeating the revolution of Muhammad b. cAbd al-Wahh?b against the graves and the living places of the awliy?\m While he severely criticizes Shiite devotion, the repression of women, political opponents and religious minorities did not upset Hanafi. He even hails the persecution of the Bahai minority as eradication of a crypto-Zionist movement that wants to abolish jih?d. He compares severe punishment, not only of representatives of the old system but also of ordinary criminals, favourably to the Western juridical systems, which he describes as too mild as well as corrupt and inefficient.

But as has been shown his main concern is obviously the revitalization of Nasserism,212 which he intends to reinvigorate by creating an ideology capable of mobilizing the masses for its support, thus rendering a second implosion like the one in 1970 impossible. Therefore Nasser's tactical attempt to legitimize the revolution with religious slogans ought to be overcome by systematic ideological activity.213 In several writings he articulates his desire for a N?siriyya shdbiyya, cleansed of the deficiencies of the "bureaucratic" precursor; and the "Islamic Left" is identical with "peoples' Nasserism".214 In the seventies, Hanafi associated with the Nasserist Tajammuc Party and not with the Ikhw?n. He wrote a large number of his articles for its daily al-Ah?ll.215 This does not contradict his intention to bring about 210 iii.335f. thawra ?raniyya; v. 18 Asiy?; on Bahais also iii.27 ghazw; the Ikhw?n took a simi lar stance: Matthee: p. 258. 211 iii.335 thawra ?raniyya; modernist attitudes exposed in vii.314-22 al-mar'a al-arabiyya mahr?ma min huq?qih?ka muslima, 1985; V.246,7ff.

His concept of pluralism, too, must not be confused with the liberal idea of pluralism, because it does not imply the legitimacy of different interests or objectives. Not unlike the block-party system in pre-1989 Central Europe it rather means justifying one objective with different slogans: tahrlr al-ard bismill?h, bism al-hurriyya, bism al-tabaqa al-?mila, bism al-watan al- arabi.219 Hanaf?'s rejection of the hadlth about the firqa n?jiya is usually interpreted as a plea for religious tolerance. This, too, should be scrutinized more closely:220 It is not valid for Ahmadis, Ismailis and especially Bahais whom he wants to see exterminated 216 Cf. a presentation for a Western audience: A. Said pp. 24,40; similar in the same book M.

Nevertheless it should not be forgotten that Hanafi revolutionized academic teaching in Egypt by introducing a more democratic style based on discussion instead of rote-learning the professor's dicta: Abu Zayd (1999) pp. 96ff. 220 VonK?gelgenp. 221n826.</page><page sequence="48">110 MARTIN RIEXINGER (as organizations). He does not deal with their teaching extensively because his condemnation is a takfir siy?sl: their cardinal sin is their pro-Westernism.221 Hanaf?'s attempt to revitalize Nasserism has to be considered in a larger context: it is the specific Egyptian formulation of his demand to endow Third-World ideologies with a more solid theoretical foundation: It is the task of our generation, to bring forth a multitude of theoretical judgments, so that the civilizational development of the "self (masar ai-ana) comes close to the civilizational development of the "other" in respect of theoretical judgments, so that we read Descartes, Kant, Hegel and Husserl with the intellect while in our hearts we are sympathizing with Nasser, Nkrumah, Senghor, Guevara, Kaunda, Kenyatta and Nyerere. Those are the experiences of our generation, which we did not reflect upon (tarakn?h? bid?n tanz?r), and we moved toward ready-made theories without living their reality or undergoing their experiences (d?na an nd?sh w?qiah? au namurr bi-tajribatih?). We are challenged to elevate these writings (of the Third-World leaders) from the level of mere rhetoric to the level of theory and to elevate them out of the field of lived experiences (taj?rib md?sha)222 onto the level of concepts.223 The choice of words already shows that the longing for an upswing of theoretical thought in the Third World is derived from his morphological concept of history. But although Hanafi, when he deals with the past, only contrasts Islam as "East" in opposition to the "West", he suddenly speaks of the whole Third World as "East" when he deals with the present: in the index of his Muqaddima... even Tito and Latin Americans are listed among the Easterners!224 The main source for this upswing 221 v.71 Asiy?: in the same context Hanafi ironically also condemns Sayyid Ahmad Khan although he was the first to sing the tunes that Hanafi continues when he pleads for a re-ap preciation of rationalist trends in early Islam, a reconsideration of the accord between hadxth and Qur'an and above all for an understanding of revelation that eliminates the contradic tion between the "Word of God" and the laws of nature, the "Work of God". Cf. Troll pp. 134ff., 172ff., 216f., 226f; Brown pp. 33f. 222 This awkward construct (Fr. exp?rience v?cue) is generally used by non-German pheno menologists to render the associative aspect of "Erlebnis" cf.

On the other hand Japanese and all Jews, including those from Arab countries, appear as Westerners. This inconsistency has also been singled out by Qansuwwa, p. 220, who concludes that Hanafi" fails to present objetive criteria for the "self and the "other". Recently, in an interview for a German online-magazine ("Die Globalisierung", part 1) and his debate with al-cAzm (1999), Hanaf? (p. 41) seems to have become quite pessimistic with regard to the anti-Western identity of Latin America: "Li</page><page sequence="49">NASSERISM REVITALIZED 111 will be the seven thousand years of consciousness to which the Third World can look back, whereas the consciousness of the West dates back only two thousand or two and a half thousand years.225 His "Occidentalism" is also to be considered in this context: it is supposed to show that the "West is in no way superior to other world-cultures and that its history can never serve as role-model for their development, a theory which is hidden behind the legend of world-civilization".226 Moreover, his historicist concept contains a serious warning for all Arab secularists: their attempt to stem the tide of Islamic awakening is doomed to fail because it contradicts the laws of history.227 The short, adverse comments by secularist intellectuals show that they share more or less the view of Tar?b?sh? and Hattar, who both stress his affinity to Islamism.228 Most critics disapprove of Hanaf?'s instrumentalist eclecticism: Abu Zayd accuses him of borrowing relentlessly from rightist as well as from leftist schools.229 Hanaf?'s concept of authenticity is questioned by Hattar from the Marxist point of view. Notwithstanding his dogmatic convictions, he convincingly demonstrates that Hanafi never pays attention to the fact that heritage is something men pass on and accept or reject. This leads him to the polemical assertion that Hanaf?'s concept is mere biologism, because tur?th seems to be inherent to genes.230 In al-Tur?th wa-l-Tajdld Hanafi himself frankly admits that he considers the potential for mobilization of ideological concepts their most important aspect by denying that they are true or false as such. beration theology has weakened and the youth has Americanized (sic), its civilizations have become blurred, it is neither African nor Indian, neither Spanish nor Portuguese, nor North American". 225 Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 549,-2ff. 226 Hanafi, Muqaddimap. 30,1 Iff., p. 33,6ff., p. 39,-7ff, p. 40,lff. 227 vi.320ff. all?dhxnayaqif?n didd al-sahwa al-isl?miyya l?yafham?n q?n?n al-ta'r?kh, 1988 in "al-Khal?j" 228 al-Azmeh p. 48, 93; Arkoun pp. 183f; interview of Arkoun by Koningsveld and Haleber in Koningsveld pp. 288f; Zakariyy?5 p. 31; Tar?b?sh? in J?bir?/Hanaf?, Hiw?r p. 143 and Hattar p. 168f: way b?rjuw?zi sagh?r, salafiyya, pp. 179ff.; cf.

Ism? il, accused Hanafi of apostasy, with reference to a denial of the miracles and a statement that God is a mere projection. Hanafi defended himself by pointing to the fact that the accusations were based on quotations taken out of context, especially from passages where he quotes opinions of firaq and does not express his own point of view. But unlike Abu Zayd, Hanafi seems to have found more support from Azhar scholars and State authorities, in which the fact that the attack on him was considered an attack on the "modernist faction" around Hanaf?'s friend Zaqz?q and Shaykh Tant?w?, and hence the state, may have played a considerable role.232 Unlike his Arab critics, Western scholars, with the exception of Von K?gelgen and Hildebrandt, have paid astonishingly little attention to Hanaf?'s logical flaws, the distortions of the doctrines which he refers to and the plethora of blatant historical mistakes, which they would? hopefully?mark red in their students' papers. The less euphoric researchers express their disappointment about the discrepancy between Hanaf?'s high pretensions and the lack of concrete analyses and proposals.233 Hanaf?'s apparent hypocrisy with regard to the Western public i.e. preaching dialogue abroad, and declaring the clash of civilizations at 231 Hanaf?, Tur?th p. 66: "laysa lil-aq?xd sidqfi dh?tih?, bal sidquh? huwa mad? ta'?khxfi l-hay?t al-amaliyya wa taghyiruh? lil-w?qi ... wa lay sa lah? ayy muq?bil m?ddifi l-?lam al-kharij? ka haw?dith ta'?khiyya aw ashkh?s aw muassas?t, ill? min al-waq? al-a?d alladh? huwa h?mil al ma an?wa mayd?n al-fil"; Salvatore (1999) p. 237: considers similar statements ?a rejection of the reification of knowledge"; viii.312 kayfayufakkir, iii.37f, 40 halyaj?zu sha/an al-sulh mda Ban?

Notwithstanding the lack of influence in the realm of day-to-day politics, the impact of Hanaf?'s writings on educated people in Egypt and the Maghrib should not be underestimated.236 In conclusion, the main problem with Hanafi is his diffuseness, which cannot be attributed to his eclecticism alone. Rather, it is due to a relentless instrumentalization of ideological elements for an objective which itself has not been sufficiently thought through. He calls for resistance against a despised West. But simultaneously he implicitly admits that he considers the latter superior by choosing it as the yard stick against which to measure the Islamic heritage. In this respect Hanafi has a well-known predecessor: his role-model al-Afgh?n?. So if one replaces the word technology by ideology, Keddie's statement on the teacher, equally suits the disciple: "The conflict between the urgent need to adopt Western techniques and the equal need to combat dumb admiration of the West accounts for many of al-Afghanis contradictions".237 234 Hamzawy p. 359. 235 A certain exception is Hanafi himself who occasionally admits that the reception of Western culture has become an integral element of Egypt's heritage during the last century and a half: Hanafi, Muqaddima p. 57. z% rT\ie evidence for this is rather impressionistic: Tibi (1992) p. 120 relates that his argu ments are often repeated by Egyptian students in discussions. 237 Keddiep. 96; similar conclusions by Hattar p. 161; and Hildebrandt p. 99ff.
