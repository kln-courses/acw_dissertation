<plain_text><page sequence="1">chaos but also 'to the setting up of that new order which was designed to exploit and supersede the chaos' (p. 57). John Casey's essay reflects on the philosophical and literary implications of the concept of the 'noble' as it appears in the classical and Renaissance traditions, particularly Aristotle and Shakespeare. The concept of the 'noble', in Casey's view, is 'a style that sees the state and its social arrangements as natural, part of a natural order of things, and perhaps sees the political realm as importantly one of forms, honour, appearance, representative individuals' (p. I53). The noble makes the society appear as a system of forms, open to inspection by those it contains and makes it appear as beneficient. Frank Cioffi's essay examines the limits of empirical methods by analysing some excellent examples from Tolstoy, Frazer, and Freud. Arguing in a Wittgensteinian vein, Cioffi says that we often wish to understand certain phenomena by discovering their causes, but that such discoveries do not put to rest our sense of fascination and puzzlement. No discovery of causal relations, Cioffi argues, will help resolve the nature of the phenomena because our real interest lies in the desire to get a sense of their bearings, to make them perspicuous so that what is hidden in them and hence a source of puzzlement will come to light. The reason we search for further information about the phenomena that capture our interest is that often enough such an inquiry does indeed prove fruitful. The conceptual error arises in thinking that all phenomena that puzzle us can be similarly resolved by further knowledge provided by causal inquiry. Those interested in coming to terms with recent theorizing concerning philosophy and literature will greatly benefit from a perusal of this volume. It provides analytic anchoring for many problems which are all too often resolved by grand theoretical gestures in current literature criticism. SUREH RAVAL UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA The Iliad. By MARTIN MUELLER. (Unwin Critical Library) London, Boston, Massachusetts, and Sydney: Allen &amp; Unwin. I984. x+ 2o pp. ?I5.00. Aspects of the Epic. Edited by TOM WINNIFRITH, PENELOPE MURRAY, and K. W. GRANSDEN. London and Basingstoke: Macmillan. 1983. xii + 2 I pp. ?20.00. Homer has been served well in the last forty years by poetic translations of the highest quality, especially those by Robert Fitzgerald, that have delivered him from pedestrian or archaic language, and by a series of critical and scholarly studies that appeal to the general reader, beginning with Cedric Whitman's pioneering Homer and the Heroic Tradition (Cambridge, Massachusetts, I959). Now appears a full- length study of the Iliad by a professor of English trained in classical philology. Martin Mueller's contribution to the admirable Unwin Critical Library accom- plishes the formidable task of making the prosody and formal structures of Homeric epic comprehensible and exciting both to classical scholars and to general readers. In six chapters he examines the relation of the Iliad to history, oral poetry, and the modern reader, plot structures, fighting in the Iliad, the simile, the gods, and 'repetition and contextual surplus' in the composition. At the outset Professor Mueller dismisses the conception of Homer as a naive genius almost hidden by inherited conventions and dismisses also the long-held conception of the epics as renderings of a glamorous and primitive age. Rather, the Iliad's heroic vision is the product not mainly of the 'impoverished material conditions following the collapse of Mycenean culture' but of 'a more radical and metaphysical poverty'. The epic 'is never a description but a fiction of desire, born out of a fascination with, yearning for, and revulsion at physical violence'. Such fictions of desire are played against renderings of a meaner-spirited world, especially Reviews I53</page><page sequence="2">in the Odyssey, a world that may correspond to that of the polis before its glorious ascendancy, yet the Iliad, 'rather like a club, bestows on its members privileges that persist in the face of grave moral shortcomings'. Mueller discourages an evolution- ary reading of the poems and does not hold with those (myself included) who see a radical critique of heroic values in the Iliad and their replacement in the Odyssey by a true society based on a less elite and destructive index of individual worth. His discussion of epithets dismisses the 'aesthetics of the adjective as formal muzak' and leads to a brilliant exposition of the ways in which the poet manipulates various formulas as part of his creative independence. The Parry-Lord emphasis on such conventional elements as a straitjacket yields to the view that Homer frets not at the formula's narrow room but uses the limitations it imposes as a creative challenge. 'One should not', Mueller continues, 'substitute a dichotomy of formu- laic, and non-formulaic discourse for the continuum of a poetic language subject to rules of varying strictness'. The Introduction concludes by emphasizing with scholars like Lesky and Loyd-Jones that Homer, in the words of Plato, was 'the first teacher and master of tragedy', a point which John Herington has brilliantly developed in a recent study. Not everyone will agree with Mueller's point that in rejecting Agamemnon's offered amends for his 'violation of distributivejustice' Achilles not only violates that norm but commits treason. One might argue that the traumatic violation of honour suffered by Achilles is such that it cannot be redressed by the chief's panic-stricken attempt to buy his services in the face of a threatened defeat. On the other hand, there is ample evidence for reading Achilles's behaviour as wrong-headed, as he himself sees after the death of Patroklos, but a tragic view might take a leaf from Adam Parry's article, 'The Language of Achilles', in perceiving the hero as a victim of heroic conventions too narrowly construed. Such a dichotomy, Mueller shows, lies at the heart of Hector, who abdicates his role as defender of Troy to assume an Achillean role of aggression against the Achaeans: 'Hektor cannot stay at home precisely because he treasures its values so highly.' Deluding himself about his power as a warrior, he adopts a necessitarian view of his choices, as Achilles does. Like Achilles and Patroclus a victim of earlier decisions, Hector achieves a final anagnorisis, 'a knowledge that is instantaneous, comprehensive, and leads to a resolution that no longer requires the treacherous support of hope .... Only at this moment is Hector equal to Achilles and superior to the other Iliadic characters in the depth and intensity and consciousness of life as limited and valorised by the fact of death'. 'What particles are to the sentence, similes are to the Homeric narrative.' They mark the context as worthy of heightened suspense, and chains of similes may trace stages in the hero's aristeia, as when Achilles's eyes burn at the sight of his Hephaestian armour, his arming is compared to a blazing mountain, Priam sees him as the Dog-Star in his approach to Troy, and Hector flees before the Achillean spear 'that shines like fire or the rising sun'. The series is proleptic of the fall ofTroy,just as the chain of maritime similes marking the stages of Satan's journey to his climactic encounter with Eve is proleptic of the Fall of Man. Drawn from 'a wider experience of the world than the narrative itself reveals', similes of predatory animals 'tend to underscore the austerity of the poem. The bulk of them are placed agrou ep' eschatein, in the marginal zone between human habitation and wilderness', thus mediating between normal cultural conventions and the worse than predatory bloodlust of the warrior. Simile families 'show a high degree of subtle differentiation . . . very responsive to simile placement', even when they operate through contrast rather than resemblance. Contrast similes are drawn not from the marginal zone but from the human world of farmers and woodsmen and are charged with an ironic pathos that 'measures the loss of the warrior's humanity'. Reviews I54</page><page sequence="3">Mueller then goes on to distinguish a typos of repetition in the Iliad quite divorced from any manifestation of the formulaic, in which a passage ranging in length from a single line to thirty lines is repeated. Such passages exhibit what he calls 'contextual surplus', that is, resemblances between two or more instances not required by the meaning of the lines in question. Often contextual surplus is 'remarkable both for its specificity and its pointlessness', but in any case it is 'the product of an individual mind that betrays its presence in the text by the persistence and sometimes quirkiness of its associations'. While the 'collective memory of formulaic diction points to a process of composition to which the ordinary concept of a text is inappropriate, the individual memory of contextual surplus presupposes on the part of the author a sense of textual identity fundamentally like ours, although it is characterised by a very high tolerance to verbatim repetition'. Mueller concludes that 'the account of composition that reconciles these two types of memory and repetition also permits us to integrate into one hypothesis the major insights of analytical, utilitarian, and oral theories about the composition of the Iliad'. In a splendid analysis of the opening lines Mueller shows how its cumulative (as opposed to periodic) style permits a sentence, like the poem itself, to be always complete and always expanding. 'A procedure that allows for continuous forward composition also tolerates subsequent insertions of additional materials: thejoints of narrative stretch composed in this fashion are rarely so tight that something cannot be squeezed in.' Narrative joints with significant discrepancies 'are the result of an editing technique that did not keep pace with the poet's architectonic ambition' and are evidence of the evolution of a poem complete at every stage. The evidence of consistent inconsistencies in self-referential 'doublets', traditionally used to prove interpolations by other poets, argues for unity of composition, although Mueller joins many other scholars in rejecting the Doloneia, which may seem a reasonable but regrettable conclusion. A profounder regret may arise from Mueller's offhand suggestion that the Odyssey is the work of a younger poet. This provisional assumption leads Mueller to rate the later epic below the Iliad because 'Odysseus' false accounts of his adventures describes an unheroic, almost mean-spirited world'. Following his own intimations of the metaphysical poverty of the post-Mycenean age in which the Iliad was composed, Mueller could well have seen the destitution and rapacity of the post-war world in the Odyssey as evidence of authorial unity. As he fails to note, that epic is founded on a conception of married love that is the foundation stone of the first viable society represented in the fictions of the western world. It is also a searching expose of the limitations of heroic egotism stripped of its glamorous trappings. In conclusion let me say that I cannot think of any study of the Iliad more informative and intellectually exciting than Mueller's. The seven essays in Aspects of the Epic are also mainly concerned with Homer. Penelope Murray's opening piece, 'Homer and the Bard', is a pleasant but not very informative sketch of the character and functions of bardic performances, with particular attention paid to passages in the Homeric poems in which the perform- ances of various aoidoi are seen as contributing to an 'autobiography' that conceals as much as it reveals about Homer himself. G. S. Kirk seeks to find in Books 5 and 6 of the Iliad the signatures of Homer's style. He finds the quintessential genius of the Homeric style in the Hector- Andromache scene. Of the book as a whole he observes that 'although it is only the scenes inside Troy that are undeniably Homeric in the fullest sense, those leading directly up to it are consonant with the idea of special attention being given by the monumental composer of the whole book 6'. Book 5, in contrast, with its unusually anthropomorphic representations of the gods and its 'fantastic happenings that exceed the regular Homeric conventions governing the relations of gods and men', is Reviews I55</page><page sequence="4">nevertheless 'a highly coherent stretch of narrative', with numerous 'crosslinks' to Books 6 and 4. Kirk finds in the simultaneous spiritualization and anthropomorphi- zation of the gods here a sign of Homer's originality that enormously enlarges our idea of Homer's own range of style and tastes. In 'Homeric Epic and the Tragic Moment', John Gould begins by examining the sombreness and biting irony with which Attic tragedians represented Homeric episodes and characters to raise the question of how much of the values of the Iliad and the Odyssey survived. Following Plato's celebration of the rhetorical brilliance and verisimilitude of the Homeric characters and Aristotle's emphasis on the dramatic aspects of the Iliad, he affirms that 'the moment where human blindness and the limitations of man's vision and understanding are suddenly confronted with undeniable truth in a lightning stroke' is characteristic of Homer's tragic style. In Achilles's reception of the news of Patroclus's death there lies 'the germ of much fifth-century tragedy', and also in the tragic ambivalence of Hector and the anticipated sufferings of the Trojan women. As Gould later implies, the major simile that marks Odysseus's weeping response to Demodocus's song of the Wooden Horse in Book 8, comparing his grief to that of a woman whose husband has fallen in defence of his city, must have been a major source for Euripides. K. W. Gransden's essay on 'Virgil's Iliad' should be quite useful to anyone who finds Virgil's adaptation of Homer fraught with difficulties. He begins with a detailed examination of the ways in which Virgil has combined in Aeneidg the embassy of Iliad 9 and the Doloneia of Odyssey I o in 'perhaps the finest "esemplastic" insight in the entire structure of the Aeneid'. He then develops the Virgilian pathos that emanates from the night-mission of Nisus and Euryalus as contrasted with the foray of those hardened killers Odysseus and Diomedes with, perhaps, a too uncritical reading of the self-indulgent venture that might havejeopardized a crucial mission to Aeneas. Granted that, in this crisis, as in the foot-race, 'it is of his friend, not of himself' that Nisus thinks, are we not to be critical of the dira cupido that motivates the romantic abandonment of the touching but infatuated pair? Aeneas could approve of Euryalus's victory in the foot-race, won by his friend's foul: 'Tutatur favor Euryalum lacrimaeque decorae I gratior et pulchro veniens in corpore virtus.' All's fair in love, perhaps, but in war the passion that ignores duty (especially when combined with the shameful slaughter of the sleeping foe and Euryalus's cupidinous seizure of the flashing helmet that dooms them both) seems to me to qualify deeply 'the courage that holds cheap the light' ('animus lucis contemptor'), a 'profoundly Virgilian emotion'. None the less Gransden's conclu- sive statement is persuasive: 'For Virgil, despite his access to spiritual consolations unknown to Homer, fate and death conspire to produce a sense of life as in itself tragic, something to be endured rather than enjoyed, with none of Homer's exuberant vitality and zest.' The rest of Gransden's essay is devoted to Virgil's involvement, through apostrophe (on the model of Homer's vocatives to Patroclus), in the pathos of his characters, thus increasing 'vatic empathy' in 'an epic of sensibility and weltschmerz .. ., a kind of proleptic shudder of memory'. The discussion of Virgil's use of Hector and Achilles as fluctuating controls working in the characters of Aeneas and Turnus is deft, but the concluding observation does little justice to the hero of the Iliad: 'Virgil had to write the wrath theme out of the Iliad, for the enormous and paranoid egotism of Achilles was inappropriate to a stoic hero and father-figure of the nation.' In 'The Epic Theme of Love' John Bayley argues that love in epic may almost be recognized by a tense incongruity between the sublime and the realistic - even the grotesque - and he finds Milton the greatest exponent of this complex view: 'Milton has successfully established the idea that marriage is a privileged state, belonging to the God-like part of man, but also hallowing in a highly satisfactory manner every I56 Reviews</page><page sequence="5">Reviews I57 instinct of their quotidian lower being.' He explores with great perception the interpenetration of high and low, most notably in the contending passions of selfishness and generosity in Adam and Eve after the Fall: 'Interplay of the low and high elements - heroism and calculation, majesty and meanness - create in the relations of Adam and Eve an effect of the whole truth.' He tellingly scores off the vulgarization of the high style in some poems of the Augustan Age where it became 'natural to make the effect over-ornate and over-explicit, to ham it up by deliberately describing trivial or mundane activities'. This goes far to explain one's dissatis- faction with the reams of commendatory poems addressed by Waller and Dryden and countless contemporaries to various dim-witted ladies of rank or notoriety, in which the ostensible compliment is undercut by the knowing masculine assumption that the recipient will swallow anything as long as it seems flattering. Pope, on the other hand, could brilliantly keep the balance, and in the greatest epic treatments of love, 'the harmonious relation of the high and low is no more mocked by the mock- heroic than is the idea in the poetry of the heroic itself'. This is an invaluable contribution. Tom Winnifrith's 'Homer in Byzantine Dress' will appeal to those who feel that the Byzantine tradition of epic is unjustly neglected. Considering how much attention is given to medieval Latin, it is surprising that Byzantium has remained largely a hortus conclusus, and his expert discussion of the Digenis is a big step in the right direction. GEORGE DEFOREST LORD YALE UNIVERSITY Trials of the Self: Heroic Ordeals in the Epic Tradition. By GEORGE DEFOREST LORD. Hamden, Connecticut: Archon Books/ Shoe String Press. I983. x + 249 pp. In the predecessor to this book, Heroic Mockery: Variations on Epic Themes from Homer to Joyce (Newark, Delaware, I977), George deForest Lord explored the subheroic elements in ancient epic (comic or undignified episodes concerning the Olympian gods, or 'low' happenings among heroes, as when Ajax slips in cowdung during the heroic games in the Iliad). He was in the main concerned not with any radical critique of the heroic ethos of the kind which is expressed by Thersites but with the Iliad's ability to 'incorporate the modes of tragedy, comedy, satire, and farce without being defined or limited by any one of them'. He surveyed several assimilations and transformations of the spirit of Homeric epic in Shakespeare, in Milton's War in Heaven, in Pope's Dunciad, in Joyce, and in the school sports ofWaugh's Decline and Fall (the last the subject of an especially masterly analysis at the beginning of the book). His central topic in that earlier book was 'play': the phenomenon of heroic games in the classical epics, the idea of war itself as a sport to the Olympians, the changing relationships of play to culture from Homer to Virgil, and thence to later writers. Trials of the Self focuses on themes of epic journeying, on the 'individuation' of the hero through a voyage of self-discovery, on that initiation through hardship which leads to self-definition and to the passage from heroism to culture: 'The narrative point of departure is defined by a destroyed city, a ruined culture, a hero ignorant of his true identity, whose mission is the ordeal of self-individuation in the service of cultural redemption.' Comedy plays its part in this process too, and Lord draws on Jung and Campbell for models of 'the dark interior passage from tragedy to comedy'. But in this context comedy has more to do with what 'ends well' than with what is 'funny'. The principal texts are the Odyssey, the Aeneid, the Divine Comedy, Paradise Regained, the Prelude, Byron's Don Juan, Moby-Dick, and Heart of Darkness. The first four are seen as resting on a known 'controlling myth', 'familiar to us if not to the</page></plain_text>
