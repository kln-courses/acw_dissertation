<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCTION TO THE METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE KARL BRITTON C HARLES SANDERS PEIRCE once described him- self as "an individual whose unbiased study of scien- tific logic has led him to conclusions not discordant with traditional dogmas." Some of these conclusions have been familiar to us for nearly fifteen years through the selection of his works, edited in 1923, by Professor Morris Cohen, and pub- lished under the title, Chance, Love and Logic (Harcourt, Brace and Kegan Paul). But these, as the editor remarked, did not do anything like justice to the thought of Peirce-to that "vast philosophical system of which he left only some fragmentary outlines." Now, however, the philosophical department of Har- vard University has published six large volumes of his Collected Papers,' and promise still more. From these, especially from the latest (Scientific Metaphysics, Vol. VI), we are at last able to consider for ourselves the value of Peirce's conclusions and to compare them with the traditional dogmas of the philoso- phers and the theologians.2 From these papers, also, we gain some slight acquaintance with the author; but it is from the letters, not yet published, that we may hope to come to understand this remarkable and much-suffering personality. Meanwhile much can be gathered I Ed. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Harvard University Press and Humphrey Milford, I93I-35), V01s. I-VI. 2 In Vol. VI we find reprinted all the papers of the second part of Chance, Love and Logic and one chapter (the fifth) of the first part. To these are added many papers not previously published at all and many that appeared in journals (the Hibbert, the Monist, etc.) and in dictionaries. There are two parts: "Cosmology and Ontology" and "Religion." It is described by the publishers as the "metaphysical culmination" of Peirce's thought and continues the discussions begun in Vol. I (Principles of Philosophy). Unless otherwise stated, numerical references in this paper are to the paragraphs of Vol. VI. My thanks are due to Professor G. E. Moore for permission to make use of a critical notice of Vol. VI which I wrote for Mind, July, I937. 435</page><page sequence="2">436 ETHICS from his correspondence with his friend William James. Some of their letters to each other are given, with illuminating com- mentary, in chapters xxxii, lxxv, and lxxvi of Professor R. B. Perry's Thought and Character of William James, recently pub- lished by the Oxford University Press; some considerable use will be made of this in what follows.3 I shall try to give an outline account of Peirce's teaching on metaphysics and religion and to relate it to his character and to the philosophical influ- ences to which he was subject. I. CHARACTER AND ENVIRONMENT Peirce had the misfortune to be born into an academy, the heir-apparent to a chair at Harvard, and, because of his own personal character, never to find any permanent employment in any university. He was born in i839, the son of Benjamin Peirce, the foremost American mathematician of his day and professor at Harvard. Charles Peirce was an infant prodigy who soon learned all that his father could teach him-this in- cluded mathematics, bridge, and wine-tasting, but did not in- clude the way to organize a happy and easy life. At Harvard, as he says, he was "vain, snobbish, uncivil, reckless, lazy, and ill-tempered." He graduated seventy-first out of a class of ninety-four. Suitable employment was hard to find, and at the age of twenty-two he entered the United States Coastal Survey and there remained for thirty years, doing pioneer work in geodesics, devoting all his spare time to philosophy, lecturing at colleges and societies from time to time, and building a great reputation. James wrote in i869: The poor cuss sees no chance of getting a professorship anywhere, and is likely to go into the observatory for good. It seems a great pity that as original a man as he is, who is willing and able to devote the powers of his life to logic and metaphysics, should be starved out of a career, when there are lots of professorships of the sort to be given in the country to "safe," orthodox men.4 3 My thanks are due to Professor Perry for giving me his permission to quote ex- tensively from this book.

S. PEIRCE 437 Peirce had a regular income so long as he was attached to the Survey, but he was rash with money, and he retired from active service in i887 without adequate resources. In i883 he divorced his first wife and married again and so succeeded in alienating some of his friends. His financial troubles began in earnest after i89i; he was obliged to retire into the country, to Milford, Pennsylvania, and to keep himself by writing at great speed for the Nation and the Century Dictionary. James kept coming to his aid; there were lectureships and there were schemes for publication. Peirce began to be seriously ill in i909, James died the next year. Peirce lingered on another four years, writing very little now-a victim of cancer.5 Everyone, including Peirce himself, seems to have recognized his conceit; this was certainly one reason for his failure to make an academic career. He describes himself, at the age of thirty- eight, at the fashionable Brevoort House in New York City: "I insensibly put on a sort of swagger which I hope I have no- where else, and which is designed to say: 'You are a very good fellow in your way; who you are I don't know and I don't care, but I, you know, am Mr. Peirce, distinguished for my varied scientific acquirements, but above all for my extreme modesty in which respect I challenge the world' "(Perry, 1, 538: a letter from Peirce to James, i877). Twenty years later he wrote again to James: "After all, I have no reason to distress myself that my philosophy does not get expounded. Your Harvard students of philosophy find it too arduous a matter to reason exactly" (ibid., II, 420). It was, perhaps, more than anything else, this intellectual self-righteousness, combined with emo- tional instability, that prevented him from following the pro- fession for which he was so suited and in which all his ambitions lay. Professor Perry contrasts the two characters of Peirce and James: James was instinctively, as well as by breeding and experience, adapted to social intercourse, and, despite his neurasthenic tendencies and intel- 5 The information in this paragraph is derived from Paul Weiss's article on Peirce in the Dictionary of American Biography.</page><page sequence="4">438 ETHICS lectual preoccupations, was a man of the world. Peirce was ill at ease, of uncertain temper, and found it increasingly difficult, as life went on, to associate with his fellow-men. James was slow to take offence and always gave other people the benefit of the doubt, while Peirce was touchy and prone to suspicion; the one being almost excessively modest and appreciative of others, while the other tended to arrogance [ibid., I, 538]. The result was that Peirce was left more and more to his own company, and in his later years, in rustic poverty at Milford, he was altogether too isolated. In April, I902, he wrote to Mrs. James: You see it is like this. I came back from ten days' absence in the last week of November. Yesterday I met the village clergyman, and had a talk with him of twenty minutes. During the interval (Sc. from Novem- ber to April) I had had not over half a dozen chats with my wife, chiefly sustained by her in French, and otherwise hadn't spoken two consecutive sentences to anybody. There were four or five months' silence. It is not an exceptional period. I live always so. In this life I find I lose all dis- cernment of grades of expression [ibid., II, 423.] Meanwhile Peirce was, as always, working hard; he was capable of very long periods of continuous work. The manuscripts were accumulating, but who was to criticize and discuss them? In I907 he wrote to James: If I had some young philosophers to aid I should certainly hold myself up as a warning against withholding publication until one can be quite satisfied with his expression. The result is that I am so hemmed in with analyses upon which I labored until they are brought to a presentable finish, that I am completely cut off by them from the mass, even of the philosophical world [ibid., II, 436].6 In this isolation his friendship for James assumed great im- portance for him: "You are of all my friends the one who illus- trates pragmatism in its most needful forms. You are a jewel of pragmatism." After James's death Peirce wrote an extrava- 6 Peirce certainly developed a remarkable manner of writing in his last years; see especially the paper on "Logic and Spiritualism" (Vol. VI, Book II, chap. vii), written in I905. This seems to me a most effective and beautiful style and reads rather like the monologues of very modern plays-"The Ascent of F6" or "Murder in the Cathedral."</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 439 gant panegyric upon "America's and the world's highest re- spected and closest beloved philosophic soul," and in this, as it seems to me, he states the fundamental difference between the two: "Who, for example, could be of a nature so different from his as I? He so concrete, so living; I a mere table of con- tents, so abstract, a very snarl of twine" (i84). Peirce's interests were in himself and in theoretical questions; James's interests were in things and, above all, in other men. This is not the whole story. James was subject to much self-analysis and self- doubt; Peirce could be quite objective about himself and never lost his sense of humor. But he was academic. Wide as his interests were, they were the interests of a scholar and a scien- tist rather than of an artist or a humanist; and at times he re- lapses into the worst kind of scolding dominie. These serious limitations are most evident in his theorizing about religion. II. DETERMINING INFLUENCES Peirce began life as a mathematician, and his profession led him into physics and mechanics. These studies were of the ut- most importance in shaping all his thought, but of them I shall say no more and shall confine myself to the chief philosophical influences, beginning with those of minor importance. American philosophy before the Civil War had been domi- nated for a long time by clerical teachers in the universities and in the ministerial' training colleges; among these the philosophy of the Scottish Commonsensists was very prevalent. It is de- scribed by Professor Cohen in no very flattering terms: The Scottish Commonsense realism was a democratic philosophy in the sense that it did not depart widely from the popular views as to the nature of the material world, the soul and God. It did not rely on subtle arguments, but appealed to established beliefs. It could easily be recon- ciled with the most literal interpretation of the Bible and could thus be used as a club against freethinkers.7 Traces of this influence can be seen in Peirce's distinction be- tween real doubt and "paper doubt" (of which he accuses Hume 7 Cambridge History of American Literature, III, 229.</page><page sequence="6">440 ETHICS and Bradley); in his view that there are some propositions that cannot really be doubted at all; and in his distinction between argumentation, which is self-conscious and systematic, and ar- gument, which is not self-conscious or systematic, but which is, as a matter of psychological fact, convincing, and which could be defended by argumentation. I think that these views helped to lay the foundations of pragmatism and of Peirce's important account of practical, as opposed to purely scientific, beliefs. Peirce was an enthusiastic reader of Aristotle and the scholas- tic philosophers: Duns Scotus, Augustine, Thomas, Albertus Magnus, and William of Occam. In his thirties he was con- verted, by reading Scotus, from his early nominalism and be- came a thoroughgoing realist. He wrote in I902: I say to people-imaginative interlocutors, for I have nobody to talk to-you think that the proposition that truth and justice are the greatest powers in this world is metaphorical. Well, I, for my part, hold it to be true. No doubt truth has to have its defenders to uphold it. But truth creates its defenders and gives them strength. The mode in which the idea of truth influences the world is essentially the same as that in which my desire to have the fire poked causes me to get up and poke it [Perry, II, 4241. At Harvard, when Peirce was still in his teens, he first turned to philosophy, and it was to Kant that he first came. Peirce is a post-Kantian idealist, not only because he was influenced by Hegel and Schelling, but also because he was always in closest touch with the Critique of Pure Reason. From Kant he derives the fundamental notion that the forms of space and time and the categories of the understanding are, at bottom, psychologi- cal laws. His own "proofs" of his three categories might be de- scribed as cosmological, psychological, and biological deduc- tions, in the Kantian sense of "deduction." In the early seventies Peirce and James were members of a small group who used to meet to discuss philosophy in Cam- bridge. "The type of our thought was decidedly British," says Peirce. "I, alone of our number, had come upon the threshing-</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 44I floor of philosophy through the doorway of Kant, and even my ideas were acquiring the English accent" (Collected Papers, Vol. V, par. i2). The members were led by Chauncey Wright, who was something of a positivist, as well as a disciple of Mill. Peirce and James both became much interested in Berkeley, and Peirce even regarded him as the first pragmatist. The doc- trine that they both derived from empiricism is defined by Peirce in his famous paper, "How To Make Our Ideas Clear" (Collected Papers, Vol. V, Book II, chap. v). James maintains that this was the method by which the English and Scotch phi- losophers were "instinctively guided": The guiding principle of British philosophy has in fact been that every difference must make a difference, every theoretical difference somewhere issue in a practical difference, and that the best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by ascertaining what practical difference would result from one alternative or the other being true [Varieties of Religious Experience (I9o2), p. 443]. This principle Peirce had ever before him, and it modified, at every stage, the idealism into which he finally tried to fit his ideas. In the Monist, i892, Peirce wrote: I may mention, for the benefit of those who are curious in studying mental biographies, that I was born and reared in the neighborhood of Concord-I mean in Cambridge-at the time when Emerson, Hedge, and their friends were disseminating the ideas that they had caught from Schelling, and Schelling from Plotinus, from Boehm, or from God knows what minds stricken with the monstrous mysticism of the East. But the atmosphere of Cambridge held many an antiseptic against Concord transcendentalism; and I am not conscious of having contracted any of that virus. Nevertheless, it is probable that some cultured bacilli, some benignant form of the disease was implanted in my soul, unawares, and that now, after long incubation, it comes to the surface, modified by mathematical conceptions and by training in physical investigations [I02]. In the days when the village of Concord was the home of Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Thoreau, and was, in its way, an intellectual capital of New England, both the father of Peirce and the father of James used to meet Emerson regularly, at the</page><page sequence="8">442 ETHICS Saturday Club, in Boston. Transcendentalism was the great theme of all the pundits, lay and clerical. There is little doubt that both Peirce and James were much influenced by it and that it seemed hard for them both to express ultimate meta- physical notions in any other way. Schelling made an especially strong appeal to Peirce; both were interested in finding concep- tions common to all the sciences; both were interested in bio- logical evolution. Peirce did not find anything incompatible in idealism and pragmatism; in fact, it seemed arguable that the absolute idealists were themselves thoroughly pragmatic. This thesis was held by another Harvard contemporary, Josiah Royce: Our idealists were, one and all, in a very genuine sense, what people now call pragmatists. They were also, to be sure, absolutists; and now- adays absolutism is supposed to be peculiarly abhorrent to pragma- tists .... all these thinkers make much of the relation of truth to action, to practice, to the will. Nothing is true, for them, unless therein the sense, the purpose, the meaning of some active process is carried out, expressed, accomplished [Lectures on Modern Idealism (delivered in i906, published after his death) p. 85]. Truth meets needs; truth is also true. Of these two propositions I conceive idealism to be constituted. The first of these is pragmatist, but the second must be ab- solutist: In acknowledging truth we are indeed meeting, or endeavoring to meet, a need which always expresses itself in finite form. But this need can never be satisfied by the acknowledgment of anything finite as the whole truth. For, as Hegel well insisted, the finite is as such self-contradictory, dialectical, burdened with irrationality ..... I may assert that personally I am both a pragmatist and an absolutist, that I believe each of these doc- trines to involve the other, and that therefore I regard them as not only reconcilable but as in truth reconciled [ibid., p. 257]. Such arguments would certainly not have commended them- selves altogether to Peirce.8 But it was, of course, not Peirce but James who, by i906, had made it seem that these two doc- trines are not compatible. This was the end of a long "battle" 8 Of Royce's The World and the Individual, Peirce wrote: "The ideas are very beauti- ful. The logic is most execrable."</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 443 between James and Royce, the story of which has been ad- mirably told in Professor Perry's book. James "discovered" Royce and was, as usual, much impressed with what he had found and especially with Royce's mathematic ability. But in the end he came to see that Royce's absolutism rested only on an emotional basis and that it was held together by loose reason- ing and ambiguous phrases. In i899 he wrote: "I have come to perceive what I didn't trust myself to believe before, that looseness of thought is R's essential element. He wants it. There isn't a tight joint in his system; not one" (Perry, I, 8io). In his chapter on "Philosophy" in The Varieties of Religious Ex- perience, James declared himself against any form of transcend- ence of the soul or of God.9 To Peirce it still seemed that even the absolute could be interpreted as an "observable," and that a science of metaphysics was still possible. James gradually came to the conclusion that pragmatism made the metaphysical conceptions altogether empty. This was a personal achieve- ment of no small order, for it required him to swim against the tide of opinion for many years. Peirce, however little he might have cared to admit it, built up a metaphysical system that places him with Royce rather than with James-an idealism of the post-Kantian sort. There were certain important Kantian principles that chiefly impressed Fichte and Hegel and Schelling: a) The basis of logic and mathematics is psychological. b) Reasoning, when it becomes transcendental, is necessarily involved in antinomies. c) These antinomies must be supposed resolved, if we are to undertake unavoidable action. d) That this implies a noumenal self which is free and rational. e) That we have no other knowledge of the noumenal world [which, how- ever, Kant always assumes must exist]. f) That we have no explanation of the origin of the sense-impressions [Kant seems to assume that they derive somehow from the noumenal world, and that is all]. 9 See footnote on Royce, Varieties, p. 454; the further discussion of Royce's point of view is to be found in Pragmatism.</page><page sequence="10">444 ETHICS These principles left unsolved (and, according to Kant, un- solvable) problems, and the cogitation of Fichte, and the young enthusiasm of Schelling and Hegel, stepped in where Kant had feared to tread. Schelling came to certain conclusions:10 a) Sense-impressions must be ascribed to some activity of the self-to an unconscious activity which provides the self with an object for conscious knowledge. b) The self as known is thus identical with the knowing self; the self is both "ideal" (subject) and "real" (or objectified); for all that I know consists of states of my own mind, but in communication I realise that there are objects of knowledge which are yet not objects of my knowledge; hence I realise that my self is without these empirical limits, that it is absolute. c) Nature-the real self-shows a process of evolution; there is every- where visible a spontaneous tendency towards the creation of "sub- jectivity," that is, of mind; what looks like dead matter appears on closer investigation to be effete mind. d) By action-whether of the knower, the doer, or the artist-the self adds to its world as known; it is by effort that the phenomenal world comes into existence: but such effort is mostly unconscious: the doer acts, and then he discovers that the world has become different; the philosopher discovers the real world, and his very act of discovery has altered the world (it has, as we say, "added to the sum of human knowledge"); the artist returns to the thing that he has made, as if to something new and strange. e) In social relationships we realise that our freedom of action is limited, and we see a limited "pre-established harmony" between the real and the transcendental worlds-for we can sometimes achieve what we will. f) The finite self which is an object of my direct knowledge is nothing but a partly deceptive appearance of an absolute self; a self which is both real and ideal, and which Schelling calls the "indifference" of these two aspects. The most paradoxical and novel features of Schellingism are not to be found in the thought of Peirce: he had no love for paradox as such; he regarded the riddle of Achilles and the Tortoise as a "contemptible little catch" which any competent mathematician ought to be able to solve once and for all (I77). lo The following is largely derived from the sympathetic account given by Royce, op. cit.</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 445 And his pragmatism could make nothing of the distinction be- tween the phenomenal and the noumenal worlds; for him, the world which is open to observation, in one way or another, is the real and only world. Peirce had therefore to seek another explanation of the possibility of duty and freedom, and this he found in the hypothesis of chance. It is by reference to the same hypothesis that he explains the tendency of nature to pro- duce order, and, especially, mind; all nature shows the begin- nings of mind, and the real world is a "mental continuum." Peirce's tychism (the doctrine of chance) is thus the solution to a problem in idealist philosophy for one who could not accept the "hypothesis of freedom" in a noumenal world; it is Peirce's substitute for Schelling's "transcendental self" as an explana- tion of the possibility of action. Peirce's agapism (the doctrine that change, real event, is the result of psychological activity) and his synechism (the notion of the world as a continuum of minds) are both also obvious developments and adaptations of Schelling. Peirce, as we shall see, also had a theory of absolut- ism, but this he did not adopt as a purely scientific hypothesis, and it connects only loosely with his cosmological system. It is an extraordinary thing that Peirce should have thought that such a cosmology could be defended on empirical grounds. He seems to have argued that metaphysics must be about some- thing, however strange it may sound; but pragmatism has laid it down that all really significant sentences are about the ob- servable. Hence, even metaphysics must somehow be based on observation. "But metaphysics, even bad metaphysics, really rests on observations, whether consciously or not .... it rests upon kinds of phenomena with which every man's experience is so saturated that he usually pays no particular attention to them." Perhaps he would have made this statement in an al- together more guarded manner if he had reflected on the fact of verbal nonsense and on the nature of analytical propositions." I" Of course an altogether new notion of the importance of nonsense began with Mr. Russell's solution of the paradox about the "class of all classes that are not members of themselves."</page><page sequence="12">446 ETHICS Surely it may be the case that much of metaphysics consists in elucidations of definitions (which will give us information about language, and which will be founded only on observations of language habits) and much of it consists in emotive language (whose main purpose is not to convey information at all) and much of it in verbal nonsense which (for the average reader) is quite without any use. There will, of course, remain much that is based upon observation and which can be proved true or false by reference to observation; and of this it may well be true that much of it rests on observations that are so common that it takes great powers of abstraction and concentration to come by them. III. COSMOLOGICAL SYSTEM Peirce thought that his observations revealed three kinds of elements in all phenomena, and hence that three categories could be distinguished in the apparatus of every serious and well-founded science.I2 "First is the conception of being or existing independent of anything else. Second is the concep- tion of being relative to, the conception of reaction with, some- thing else. Third is the conception of mediation, whereby a first and a second are brought into relation ... . Chance is First, Law is Second, the tendency to take habits is Third" (32). Perhaps tychism corresponds to First, agapism to Second, and synechism to Third. These doctrines are applied to cos- mology, psychology, and biology, and their illustration in each of these inquiries constitutes a set of "deductions" in the Kantian manner. We begin with tychism. Chance "as an objective phenome- non" is defined as a property of distribution-the fortuitous distribution of elements or characters in the universe at large. 12 These are not an ordinary Hegelian triad, for they have not strictly the character of thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Peirce does not show much interest in antinomies, except as signs of fallacious reasoning. No doubt he would have been able to "recog- nize" his categories in the systems of Hegel and of Schelling. I think Peirce's triads owe something to the three characters of reality, of which Schelling speaks: the real (2d), the ideal (ist), and the "indifference" of these (3d). See esp. Vol. I, pars. 317-25.</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 447 Peirce supposes that the characters of things in the universe tend to display chance distribution as well as regularity. This hypothesis is an explanatory one, but it does not itself need explanation, for it is regularity, not irregularity, that needs ex- planation. (Here, again, chance serves the purposes of the noumenon.) Chance is used to explain: (a) Experimental errors. These naturally suggest chance, and there is no series of experi- ments whereby this suggestion could be disproved. (b) The di- versity within the universe-the "initial configuration" which has to be considered in any mechanical action. The mechanist supposes that "all the arbitrary specifications of the universe were introduced in one dose, in the beginning, if there was a beginning ..... But I, for my part, think that the diversifica- tion, the specification, has been continually taking place" (57). (c) Novelty can be explained only by spontaneity, that is, by some sort of chance variation: infinitesimal variations take place continuously, Peirce holds, and great ones, infrequently. Time is discontinuous in the present instant (86), and in this present instant action and novelty are possible. (d) Uniformity, habit, law-these are due to a chance development of a tend- ency to take habits: "All laws are results of evolution, .... underlying all other laws is the only tendency which can grow by its own virtue, the tendency of all things to take habits" (ioig). (e) Nonconservative processes: no mechanical explana- tion can be given of the irreversibility of these processes. (f) Mind and consciousness can be explained only by reference to chance. They are treated as epiphenomena by the mechanical philosophy: "It enters consciousness under the head of sun- dries, as a forgotten trifle; its scheme of the universe would be more satisfactory if this little fact could be dropped out of sight" (6i). According to Peirce, the characteristic law of mind, which gives rise to truth and error, requires the hypothesis of chance variation. In general, then, chance is to explain "three characters which mark the universe of our experience in a way of their own. They are Variety, Uniformity, and the passage of</page><page sequence="14">448 ETHICS Variety into Uniformity. By [this] I mean that variety upon being multiplied almost in every department of experience shows a tendency to form habits. These habits produce statis- tical uniformities" (97). This cosmological deduction of the categories is summarized in the article on "Uniformity" in Baldwin's Dictionary (I902; reprinted in ioig). There follows a "psychological deduction": the exposition of mind by means of the concept of continuity. This may be sum- marized shortly: (a) Feelings have a temporal spread: "we are immediately conscious through an infinitesimal interval of time." (b) Feelings have intensive continuity-this is presup- posed by the continuity of change in feelings. (c) Feelings have spatial extension; an agitation (liquefaction) in a protoplasm spreads from one point continuously through the environment: "Whatever there is in the whole phenomenon to make us think there is feeling in such a mass of protoplasm-feeling, but plain- ly no personality-goes logically to show that that feeling has a subjective, a substantial, spatial extension, as the excited state has" (I33). (d) Feelings affect each other; different stimuli com- bine in their effects: "A finite interval of time generally con- tains an innumerable series of feelings; and when these become welded together in association, the result is a general idea." (e) Ideas are properties of feeling; they combine to form general ideas and propositions-not absolutely uniformly: "The amount of arbitrariness in the phenomena of human minds is neither altogether trifling nor very prominent" (I54). (f) The unity of a person is a special form of the unity of ideas or feel- ings; a person is a general idea. (g) One mind is in communica- tion with another, that is to say, ideas are communicated; this is done through the mediation of animate and inanimate ob- jects-lips, hands, pen, and paper. Peirce argues that the fact that both the "animate" and the "inanimate" are susceptible to ideas shows that they are all alike mental-that the world is a continuum of feeling and in this communication takes place (I58).</page><page sequence="15">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 449 From these arguments, then, three conclusions are drawn: (a) scholastic realism: "General ideas are not mere words,.... but they are just as much, or rather far more, living realities than the feelings out of which they are concreted"; (b) objective idealism: "We ought to suppose a continuity between the char- acters of mind and matter, so that matter would be nothing but mind that had such indurated habits as to cause it to act with a peculiarly high degree of mechanical regularity, or rou- tine" (277); (c) evolution: not merely do concrete objects change, but also all the laws of their changes also change: "The whole Platonic world is evolutionary in its origin." The idealist view of the universe shows that reality is essen- tially social; change comes about by effort (Eros, or exuber- ance-love) of individuals to realize and to propagate ideas and to generalize them in a continuum of minds. The doctrine of agapism is therefore "what Synechism calls for." Peirce then tries to show that no satisfactory account of biological evolu- tion can be built either on mere chance or on mere necessity: effort must also be important. Mere chance (Darwin) and mere necessity (the view that "it somehow follows from the first law of motion and the peculiar, but unknown, molecular constitu- tion of protoplasm, that forms must complicate themselves more and more") are shown to be only "degenerate cases" of evolution by effort. Peirce therefore concludes that what he calls tychism, anancism, and agapism are all to be observed in nature; in other words, we observe change by minute variation, change by strides, and change by deliberate social purpose. By such arguments as these Peirce thinks he can show that three categories (variously named and described) are involved in the clear description of all reality. These famous categories are as vital to the understanding of his cosmology as of his logic and semantics: and I think Peirce would have wished his whole system to be judged as an exposition of these three no- tions. But even a Hegelian (who might share his addiction to triads) could hardly claim that Peirce's extant papers make</page><page sequence="16">450 ETHICS them even tolerably clear. But if they really are universal cate- gories they ought not to be altogether novel to us; they ought to be "recognizable" on reflection. Peirce insists on this in a letter of I903 to William James (who had complained, very humbly, that he could not understand them): "It rather annoys me to be told that there is anything novel in my three cate- gories; for if they have not, however confusedly, been recog- nised by men since men began to think, that condemns them at once" (Perry, II, 428). For the task of understanding First, Second, and Third, two papers published in Volume VI, for the first time, seem to me to be of considerable value (pp. i89-237 [dated i898] and pp. 338-48 [dated J909]).'3 Firstness seems to be described in three different ways: It is "potentiality of this or that sort-that is, some quality," perhaps, the realm of universals. It is also chance-"'mere sporting" -and again it is feeling, a simple uni- tary consciousness. Negatively it is described as not rational, general, or continuous but as capable of being rationalized and generalized. Secondness is actuality, event, the vividness of re- action, here and now. It is also feeling, but a feeling of contrast, connection; one feeling rising into consciousness and modifying a previously existing feeling, achieving some possibilities and excluding others. It is possibility become determinate and con- crete. Thirdness is described as habit, order, law. It is a con- nection of actuals, hence a connection of feelings. It is general- ity, continuity, society, relation, "sign." It is essentially transi- tional, since all law changes; it is evolution. These categories suggest to me most immediately the cos- mology of Professor Whitehead. We might correlate, perhaps, Peirce's Firstness with the Eternal Objects; his Secondness with the Real Occasion, which, for Whitehead, is a concrescence of feeling into novelty; and his Thirdness with the nexus of Real Occasions which illustrate the Eternal Objects. But a little reflection will show, I think, that Peirce is not to 13 See also Vol. I, Book III, chap. ii, etc.</page><page sequence="17">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 45I be fitted easily into a Platonic scheme: his Firstness is described as feeling, as well as abstract quality; chance and novelty are ascribed to Firstness and not to Secondness; and general ideas, the Platonic reals, seem to belong to Thirdness, not to First- ness. This presents the questions: Are we to "recognize" Firstness as possibility or as actuality? Is it the undifferentiated possi- bility of the apeiron or the definite possibility of the forms? Are we to "recognize" Secondness as the actual, the feeling? Are we to "recognize" Thirdness as the universal or as some special aspect of actuality? It seems to me that chance, in Peirce's writings, is used to cover two things that are usually kept distinct: first, the in- determinacy of universals in respect of their ingression into par- ticular things; second, the indeterminacy of particulars in re- spect of what universals they will manifest. These two are care- fully distinguished, for example, in Whitehead's chapter on "Abstraction" in Science and the Modern World. We express the first when we say that we cannot argue from hypotheticals to existential propositions (or that the ontological argument does not hold of finite conceptions); we express the second when we say that there is no necessary connection of matters of fact. It is Peirce's notion that these two are different ways of identifying the same feature of all reality. This feature he calls "Firstness." It is mere isolation, unrelatedness, separation. It is not either actuality or possibility but is a character which be- longs to the relation of the possible to the actual. Peirce seems to have thought that Firstness was more fundamental than the categories of actuality or of possibility, and cuts across them. But he did not state this at all clearly, as the following shows: Now a quality is a consciousness. I do not say a waking consciousness- but still, something of the nature of a consciousness. A sleeping conscious- ness, perhaps. A possiblity, then, or potentiality, is a particular tinge of consciousness. I do not say the possibility is exactly a consciousness: but it is a tinge of consciousness, a potential consciousness. However, the distinction is little more than verbal [22I].</page><page sequence="18">452 ETHICS Possibility is a possibility of feeling, and actuality is actual feeling; this he asserts on epistemological grounds. So that Firstness is the indeterminacy of feeling. It is the isolation, the simplicity, the unity, of feeling.'4 If this interpretation (which I put forward most tentatively) be correct, it follows that Secondness is not to be identified with mere actuality; for it is not essentially opposed to possi- bility. I think that it may be interpreted as determinacy, as opposed to indeterminacy; the definiteness of feeling; the defi- nite association of different possibilities of feeling; a conscious- ness of contrast, of something happening; the realization of pos- sibility in the here-now. But the realization of possibilities seems to follow a certain order: hard and blue can combine, but blue and yellow cannot. These incompatibilities of "forms" illustrate, as we might say, the definiteness that is the nature of the world of forms. How does Peirce deal with this? (a) The laws of logic are psychologi- cal laws. Peirce's account is pseudo-Kantian and is very ob- scure (222-37). It refers us to feeling for the unifying principle - "quale-consciousness has but one element": A can be blue and hard, because these two qualities result from different ex- periences, and in feeling at its simplest these are entirely un- related; but A cannot be both blue and yellow, because these result from the same experience, and hence would have to be united into one color. All this seems to suggest that Peirce tried to give a purely psychological account of the structure of forms; that he ascribed the laws of incompatibility to the isola- tion of feelings, that is, to Firstness. (b) Orders are shown in societies of actual events. General ideas are (i) ideas of uni- versals, formed, as Berkeley suggested, by repetition and com- bination of similar stimuli (Peirce illustrated this by reference to protoplasmic agitation); but (2) a universal is itself ideal; it is actual as a character of mental events-of events in a 14 Cf. Vol. I, Pars. 306-II.</page><page sequence="19">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 453 mental continuum. This is Thirdness. Peirce here seems to unite the Cartesian Formal Reality and Objective Reality. It is most important to note that Peirce's categories are both psychological and also logico-mathematical just because they are metaphysical. For they are (a) the terms in which we de- scribe the universe; but the universe is a continuum of feeling, and in psychology we are describing certain more complicated systems of feeling. But (b) the terms in which we describe the universe are precisely those terms whose use is governed by the "laws of thought" or the principles of logic-which provide the foundations of mathematics. That is to say, the formal struc- ture of the categories determines the structure of logic and of mathematics; and Peirce did actually put forward his whole theory of signs as an elaborate deduction from, and amplifica- tion of, the formal properties of the categories. Thus Firstness is monadic in structure-it is the simple predicate; Secondness is dyadic, relational, connective; Thirdness is the genuine tri- adic relation, and Peirce insists that all other apparently poly- adic relations can be analyzed in terms of these three forms. This topic, however, would take us beyond the purpose of this present paper or the range of the present writer; it has been discussed by Eugene Freeman in his Categories of Charles Peirce (Open Court). This very difficult scheme would seem to suggest two crit- cisms: (a) Peirce seems to have asked us to accept universals as real ante res, but Firstness hardly does justice to the definite- ness of the forms, patterns, limits. (b) Peirce gives no clear account of the mere diversity of particular things-of the Pla- tonic apeiron-of that diversity of similars that has always seemed so strange to rationalist philosophers. In the fragment of i898 (2I4 ff. ) Peirce seems to introduce a fourth principle- something that is prior to Firstness and which may be inter- preted as a principle of the unlimited; but this suggestion is not taken up in any other papers of his that I have seen, and presumably Peirce was too firmly attached to his triads.</page><page sequence="20">454 ETHICS The categories are certainly not "observational" in any sense that would have recommended them to Berkeley or Hume; they may be regarded as the rationalist's clear and distinct ideas, or as the Kantian a priori principles of the understanding-or, rather, of all perception and all cognition, unconscious as well as conscious. It is in the latter sense that they appealed to their author. A much more sophisticated view would regard them as fundamental rules of expression rather than as fundamental conditions of reception; not, of course, of all expression, but of the expression of matters of possible fact by means of structured language. "My philosophy, and all philosophy worth atten- tion, reposes entirely upon the theory of logic" (Perry, II, 419). But I do not think that Peirce could ever have been persuaded to adopt this radical view of his categories. Peirce's other cosmological doctrines consist largely of hy- potheses relating to one or more of the special sciences; they are supposed to show connections between the sciences and to lend support to the thesis of idealism. These Peirce quite rightly regarded as "scientific" and observational. They are to be ac- cepted only in so far as observations render them probable; they cannot be rendered valid by any a priori method. Usually, however, no very definite experimentation is suggested whereby the hypotheses put forward can be shown to be more probable (or even more worthy of serious attention) than the rival hy- potheses (of which the number is indefinite) which have been, or may be, put forward to explain the same data. Nowadays, I suppose, we should regard these hypotheses as speculations of a scientific, rather than of a metaphysical, kind. Few people were better equipped for this task than Peirce. IV. RELIGION Reason must be practical as well as speculative; belief is re- quired by action as well as by meditation. Peirce was inclined to emphasize the "practical" importance of any belief; that is,</page><page sequence="21">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 455 the difference it makes in experience, if it is true'5 (see above, p. 44I). But he did not want it to be thought that his pragmatism set up a mere "will to believe" as a criterion of truth. His test of truth was entirely objective: truth is that which will come to be agreed upon after all the investigation is done.'6 Peirce was alarmed at James's development of pragmatism: "I thought your Will to Believe was a very exaggerated utterance, such as injures a serious man very much" (Perry, II, 438). It was there- fore all the more important that he should do justice to that special class of beliefs in which one quite reasonably adopts a hypothesis, not on theoretical, but on practical grounds-not because it is the best available explanation of evidence, but partly because it is useful to adopt it. For "useful" in this con- text does involve one's own wishes. What exactly have my wishes to do with my beliefs? In thanking James for the dedication of The Will To Believe Peirce distinguishes "faith" from belief based simply upon ex- perimental evidence: "Faith," and the sense that one will adhere consistently to a given line of conduct, is highly necessary in affairs. But if it means that you are not going to be alert for indications that the moment has come to change your tactics, I think it ruinous in practice. If an opportunity occurs to do business with a man, and the success of it depends on his integrity, then if I decide to go into the transaction, I must go on the hypothesis he is an honest man, and there is no sense at all in halting between two lines of conduct. But that won't prevent my collecting further evidence with haste and energy, because it may show me it is time to change my plan. That is the sort of "faith" that seems useful .... [Perry, II, 222]. Here, it would seem, I will to do business, and this involves the will to believe that I am dealing with an honest man; the belief is useful because it forwards something I want; the belief is a Kantian hypothetical imperative. IS "Our idea of anything is our idea of its sensible effects" ("How To Make Our Ideas Clear," Collected Papers, Vol. V, Book II, chap. v, par. ii). I6 Ibid., par. iv.</page><page sequence="22">456 ETHICS We may gather from these remarks, and from others, that Peirce regarded it as reasonable to adopt a belief, even if it is not supported by systematically collected evidence, provided (a) it is not incompatible with beliefs so supported-there is no good reason to think it false; (b) it is, at every convenient oppor- tunity, corrigible by reference to beliefs so supported; (c) it is an answer to a question which must be answered if a certain unavoidable or desirable action is to be undertaken. Peirce al- lowed exceptions to both (a) and (b): It is perfectly true that the belief which I shall do well to embrace in my practical affairs, such as my religion, may not accord with the proposi- tion which a sound scientific method requires me provisionally to adopt at this stage of my investigation. Later, both the one proposition and the other may very likely be modified; but how, or which comes nearer to the ultimate conclusion, not being a prophet or a magician, I cannot yet say [2I6]. But Peirce was particularly impressed with certain beliefs which are not properly to be called "scientific," and yet which it would be positively unreasonable not to adopt for practical purposes. These beliefs, he held, are in fact supported by a mass of experiences which have never been analyzed, and many of which have never been brought into consciousness. This notion of inevitable practical beliefs is connected with Peirce's view of mind. Mind is not to be identified with reason (here he disagrees with Hegel) or even with consciousness. The distinguishing character of mind is the adaptation of an organ- ism to changes in its environment. (This adaptation is a chance- variation which has-by chance-become a habit.) It is there- fore out of instinctive ways of behavior that conscious reason- ing and argumentation have been refined. There are three stages in inquiry: first, the putting-forward of a hypothesis, "retroduc- tion," "the spontaneous conjectures of instinctive reason"; then deduction, the analysis by reason of the concept put forward, explication of its meaning; and, finally, induction, the experi- mental testing-out of the consequences of the concept. Only</page><page sequence="23">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 457 the first stage contributes new concepts to our knowledge: "rea- son" is concerned solely with the law of noncontradiction. But the stage of retroduction is not a fully self-conscious one: like Schelling's artist, the thinker does not know how he came by his new conception: it is for him as much of a surprise as for anybody. How does mankind "happen" to think of so many sound hypotheses when the number of possible hypotheses is infinite? This is, for Peirce, a "magical faculty": man is prop- erly guided in these things by il lume naturale; he seizes upon the "simplest" hypothesis-not the most economical, but the one which it is most easy and "natural" to believe; and il lume natural is a fairly reliable guide: "Not .... to the extent of guessing right the first time, nor perhaps the second: but that the well-prepared mind has wonderfully soon guessed each se- cret of nature is historical truth. All the theories of science have been so obtained" (476; see the whole of "A Neglected Argu- ment for the Reality of God," first published in the Hibbert Journal in i908 and reprinted as Book II, chap. iii, of Vol. VI). This "magical faculty" Peirce regards as one of man's most valuable instincts, akin to the bird's instinct for flight or for nest-building. (That is to say, there is not, after all, anything "magical" or even mystical about it.) He was therefore inclined to give some credence to hypotheses which "naturally" suggest themselves to men but which have never been analyzed or tested. And where such a hypothesis is involved in a given line of conduct, then, so long as it does not clash with scientific beliefs, anyone who wants to undertake the conduct in question would be unreasonable not to adopt the hypothesis as a prac- tical belief (e.g., Hume was reasonable to adopt, when he left his study, beliefs which he had no direct theoretical reason for adopting. He would have been unreasonable, since he was forced to leave his study from time to time, not to adopt these beliefs). So far I have spoken of practical beliefs in general: a religious belief is a practical belief about the whole universe, that is, it</page><page sequence="24">458 ETHICS is a practical belief of a metaphysical kind. Peirce holds that there is one hypothesis of this sort that is involved for most or all men in some conduct that seems to them desirable or even unavoidable; this is the hypothesis of God's reality; and this hypothesis is one which comes to every man-with which every man is supplied by the natural light. At some stage in any man's career it seems to him that he will do this if the hypothe- sis be true, but will do that if it be not. But it is not reasonable for him to allow his mere preference for this or that to deter- mine his belief and his conduct. For some weight must be given to the fact that all men somehow come to frame the conception of God. This fact itself needs explanation, and Peirce is inclined to think that we cannot ascribe the idea of God to the operation of any finite causes, for the reason that it is the idea of some- thing that is not finite. Peirce suggests that man's belief in God is similar to a child's or an animal's belief in the principles of mechanics; it arises out of our adaptation to the fundamental conditions of the world in which we live. This, I think, is the neglected argument of God's existence. It clearly resembles the anthropological argument of Descartes. But it is put forward as a probable explanation of facts and not as a necessary consequence or deduction from those facts. (De- duction, according to Peirce, never supplies us with synthetic connections.) This argument would have a certain plausibility (not, per- haps, very great) if "God exists" were to be interpreted in a theistic way; but Peirce gives it a meaning that connects it closely with his own theoretical conclusions as to the nature of the universe and makes it seem like a natural addition to his cosmology. The world is a continuum of minds in which there is some degree of unity and system-exactly what degree sci- ence cannot tell us. If the scientist describes this continuum as the mind of God, this will be for him only a metaphor: "Con- sidering the vague intention of it (as conceived by the non-theo- logical artist), it cannot be called false, but rather ludicrously</page><page sequence="25">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 459 figurative" (i99). But this same figurative hypothesis is one which, if a man takes it as no metaphor (believes that the uni- verse is literally a mind), he finds that it enables him to lead a better life than he could do if he did not believe it. Peirce de- clared himself assured, from what I know of the effects of Musement on myself and others, that any normal man who considers the three Universes in the light of the hypothesis of God's Reality, and pursues that line of reflec- tion in scientific singleness of heart, will come to be stirred to the depths of his nature by the beauty of the idea and by its august practicality, even to the point of earnestly loving and adoring his strictly hypothetical God, and to that of desiring above all things to shape the whole conduct of life and all the springs of action into conformity with that hypothesis. Now to be deliberately and thoroughly prepared to shape one's conduct into conformity with a proposition is neither more nor less than the state of mind called Believing that proposition, however long the conscious classi- fication of it under that head be postponed (467).'7 Peirce admits that this hypothesis is anthropomorphic, but declares boldly that it is so much the better for that. The uni- verse includes minds with a very high degree of order indeed, and at least we must be open-minded and admit that the uni- verse as a whole may itself exhibit such order; we cannot learn all about mind by the study of "effete mind" (matter) any more than we can learn all about the human mind by studying the minds of savages, children, or morons. Peirce would, I think, have welcomed Professor Whitehead's efforts to pillory the "Fallacy of Origins."'8 What are the practical questions which lead men to ask if a God exists and to feel that they must make up their minds, even upon inadequate evidence? Here, I think, James is a very much better guide than Peirce. In the Varieties of Religious Experience we are told of many states of indecision which seem to be resolvable only by the acceptance, or rejection, of a belief in God, in the fundamental goodness of the world, in some sort 17 The "Three Universes" are Firstness, Secondness, Thirdness (see 455). I8 See also I, 3i6.</page><page sequence="26">460 ETHICS of "conservation of values." One who has never been in such a state may, perhaps, be dismissed as a trivialist: 0 the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap May who ne'er hung there.19 Peirce himself, musing on his ill-luck (especially in being mis- understood), found help in the thought that God sees through the inscrutable: "Yet when I lay the wail before my God, I see that so long as I can say that I have exhausted all my en- deavors, it is a happy thing that my responsibility ends, and that the matter is in the hands of the Author of all thought" (to William James, I905: Perry, II, 434). It may be conceded, then, that these states of mind are real enough and that they do very often give rise to a belief in God and so to a solution of the emotional problem. But these states can be further examined. The researches of James are paralleled by those of Leuba,20 and Leuba tries to give an explanation of them which is entirely nonreligious. The neglected argument may indeed prove that the hypothesis of God's existence is a practical one-is one on which we are fully entitled to make up our minds, even before all the evidence is available; but which way are we to make up our minds? The neglected argument says that the mere fact that we all frame the hypothesis lends force to it. But there are many competing answers to the question: How do men come to form the idea of God? The anthropological argument is open to attack from an- thropology itself. A further question is this: Is the practical belief in God, as Peirce put forward that belief and in the form which was com- patible with his cosmology, really adequate to provide a solu- tion of the problem of evil? Is his practical belief in God really practical? '9 From the poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins (I930). 20 See James H. Leuba, The Psychology of Religious Mysticism.</page><page sequence="27">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 46i Peirce was a scientist first of all, and his scientific beliefs set the strictest limits to his religious beliefs: The universe ought to be presumed too vast to have any character. When it is claimed that the arrangements of Nature are benevolent, or just, or wise, or of any particular kind, we ought to be prejudiced against such opinions, as being the off-spring of an ill-founded notion of the finitude of the world. And examination has hitherto shown that such beneficences, justice, etc., are of the most limited kind-limited in degree and limited in range [422]. Science has no place for a God who is morally good. Man has a duty, and there are forces in the world opposed to that duty- forces to be overcome and which man naturally calls "evil." But, in fact, it is only because there is evil in the world that man makes the effort that is indispensable to his further de- velopment. The "Eros-exuberance-love" is not directly op- posed to hate, but presupposes hate as its necessary stimulus and object; it is their opposition that is resolved in the making of the world by action: "Evil-i.e. what it is man's duty to fight, being one of the major perfections of the universe." This "obvious 'solution' of the problem of evil" Peirce derived in part from Henry James, Sr., who writes of "the creative Love, all whose tenderness ex vi termini must be reserved only for what intrinsically is most bitterly hostile and negative to it- self."2' And Peirce was convinced that to hold the moral good- ness of the universe had already been shown to be unreasonable; it had not, perhaps, been disproved by science, but "the spirit of science is hostile" to it. Peirce thus identifies himself with a great tradition (with Spinoza as well as with the post-Kantian idealists)-a tradition which is distinguished by its lack of nar- row dogmatism and fanaticism. But it is a tradition that cannot reassure men of the absolute value of their ideals or of their sufferings, and it is a tradition that lays itself open to the charge of worshiping a God of might only-the God of the Big Bat- 21 Substance and Shadow (i863), p. 442; cf. Whitehead, Religion in the Making, pp. I38-40.</page><page sequence="28">462 ETHICS talions. And, in fact, Peirce's later writings (e.g., Book II, chap. iv) show signs that he was anxious to remedy this. He suggests that God may be quite genuinely creative and that this would require that time is quite genuinely real-"and not the figment which Kant's nominalism proposes to explain it as being." But if time is real, perhaps God himself does not foreknow the issue of his own creative efforts (508). This would give us a picture of a God with a purpose (which includes our own "spiritual reality"), finite, moral, agonizing. But Peirce does not seem to have grasped clearly the implications of his suggestion, for in the very same paper he insists that God is, in some sense, om- niscient, infallible, omnipotent, and that he is not moral. Notwithstanding, this amoral view of God was construed by Peirce to have certain definite moral consequences. God, who is the society of minds, becomes more "perfect," the closer and richer is the communion between minds. The evolution of this communion is the creation of the world; it is now going on. Religion is thus essentially social, a religion of the church. In a letter to James written in I902 Peirce exclaims: "Ah, my logic will give a tremendous boost to spiritual views! .... With your notions of spiritual influence, why don't you join the Church?" (Perry, II, 425). In the church men may find "a life broader than their narrow personalities, a life rooted in the very truth of being" (45i)-the truth, presumably, of synechism. In this respect it is interesting to contrast the views of Peirce and of Hegel. For Peirce, God-the Absolute Mind-is not actually proved to exist; the hypothesis of God's existence is not excluded by science and is one which most men find them- selves adopting for practical purposes. There is about it some- thing optional; it is still conditional upon the undertaking of certain tasks or upon a certain way of life.22 Correspondingly, 22 The belief in God (Peirce seems to suggest) is a condition of human happiness. It is an imperative that is not categorical but hypothetical. But all men do in fact want happiness; it is therefore seen to be assertoric (see Kant's Foundations of the Metaphysic of Morals, sec. ii, par. 21).</page><page sequence="29">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 463 the institution which is the partial embodiment of the concep- tion of God is a voluntary institution; it is not the state but the church, and it is the guardian of democracy and freedom (see the paragraph on The Church, written about i895 [p. 449]). Hegel's narrower rationalism left no optional clauses and hence no optional society was adequate to embody the conception of the absolute. Of course this contrast does not spring merely from theoretical differences between two thinkers; rather this, and all their differences, spring from the political and economic differences between Prussia of the twenties and New England of the nineties, of the last century. It is noticeable also that there is nothing romantic about Peirce's collectivism or indi- vidualism. He could not, if he had seen Abraham Lincoln riding through Cambridge, have described him as the Weltgeist zu Pferde. And this is not merely a personal limitation-it could not have been done in the America of his day. A second moral consequence of Peirce's religious beliefs is that the religious life must be a life of effort, a life to be waged, a life of love, acting, and redeeming. In the Monist (I893, pp. 287 if.), Peirce argues the failure of dogmatic and clerical reli- gion to provide mankind with a moral and social gospel-the Christian gospel of love. The fervor with which this is urged was sharpened, no doubt, by Peirce's sad failure to make man- kind love him. Of both these doctrines (the consequences, respectively, of synechism and of agapism) it may be said that Peirce has, strictly speaking, denied himself the right to draw such moralis- tic conclusions. He has no adequate ground for distinguishing a good society from a bad one, a life of virtuous effort from a life of active vice. In insisting (sensibly enough) upon the full metaphysical generality of his doctrines, he has really robbed them of all emotional or practical interest. The teaching of syn- echism is not, when properly understood, that we ought to be more united than we are; it is rather that everything (good and bad, rich and poor, animate and inanimate) is inevitably united</page><page sequence="30">464 ETHICS to everything else. And the teaching of agapism, when grasped in its full scope, is simply that everything that is real is active. There is no moral comfort or inspiration here. In a similar way the Heraclitean doctrine of flux excites our interest only so long as we think in metaphors; it is a striking fact that the water in the river is not static, that spring flowers are not the same two years together, and that our own characters seem also to be in a constant interchange of state. But when we realize that the metaphysical doctrine of flux is compatible with any degree of observable stability, the moral force of the doctrine is gone. Again, the "eternity" of the forms is a doctrine with great poetic power; and, as is so often the case with poetry, the power seems to depend upon ambiguity. We assert that something is perma- nent, but in language so vague that we are able to feel reassured that those things we most value will survive, until we realize the metaphysical doctrine in its simplicity and know that it is compatible with the passing-away of everything that ever seems to pass away.23 It seems to me that Peirce renders a useful service to philos- ophy by his distinction between theoretical and practical be- liefs and his account of rational practical beliefs; these, cer- tainly, form part of what we mean by a "rational" life. Some of them-for example, the belief in an after-life-may involve beliefs about "the most general features of reality and real ob- jects" (6); that is, there may be practical beliefs of a meta- physical character. Certain beliefs of this sort were put forward by Peirce. He regarded them as adequate to resolve the inner conflicts (e.g., the problem of evil) which tend to paralyze human action; in this, as it seems to me, he may have been mistaken. He regarded them as reasonable, that is, consistent with the beliefs he held upon purely theoretical, scientific grounds. Whether they would be properly called reasonable today is a question which could be answered only by reference to the 23 See Whitehead's Adventures of Ideas, p. 5, on the different degrees of generality that the same idea may have at different times and to different groups.</page><page sequence="31">METAPHYSICS AND THEOLOGY OF C. S. PEIRCE 465 whole "scientific outlook" of today. For practical beliefs, as described by Peirce, are constantly at the mercy of experi- menters and of theorizers who hold themselves "uncommitted to any previous utterance"; the most cherished and the most necessary of them all may disappear overnight with the publica- tion of a Ph.D. thesis. Religion holds a "tenure by suffrance" from science. Since Peirce's day many changes have taken place. We could no longer say that every decent-thinking European feels that he has a place, or might have a place, in the Christian church; other incompatible institutions claim to be the embodi- ment of the absolute in human life. And the growth of science, especially of psychology, has given many religious people the feeling that their beliefs must somehow be shown not to depend upon the precarious concurrence of the scientists. Hence, two views of religious beliefs, with neither of which, I think, Peirce would have had much sympathy, have come into prominence since his death. There is, first, the notion of all dogma as re- vealed by some transcendent and unquestionable source-re- vealed as something that is actually beyond our reasons and hence beyond our criticisms. And, second, there is the posi- tivist view that religious beliefs are not really beliefs at all, in the proper sense of the word; they are essentially emotional, poetic, verbal, musical, and kinesthetic formulas which have an immediate effect on the nerves and which "resolve inner con- flicts" in much the same way as listening to secular music or taking drugs may do.24 It seems to me that Peirce was not enough of an artist to have taken much interest in this sort of view; for him dogma is nothing if not credible, and the notion of ritual for its own-for its therapeutic and aesthetic value- would not, I think, have been taken very seriously by the philo- sophical surveyor of Milford. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF WALES 24 I do not wish to imply that it is seriously held that religion is as simple a matter, or as trivial a matter, as taking drugs; but simply that its action is to be explained alto- gether along physiological lines.</page></plain_text>
