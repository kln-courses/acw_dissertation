<plain_text><page sequence="1">GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE (1) We live in a theory-loving age. But we are far from ready to develop a plausible theory of mind and, a fortiori, a plausible theory of "animal mind". Too much remains unknown as concerns both the functional sig? nificance of a wide range of animal behavior and the structural-functional characterization of the nervous system. Indeed, when it comes to the pre? diction of the behavior of large mammals in their more or less natural habitats, I am not so sure that our skills are equal to those aboriginal peoples whose survival depended on them. Much progress is being made, however. Powerful computational mod? els of the nervous system are being developed, robots capable of mimick? ing something other than the simplest behaviors are starting to be construc? ted, new neuro-anatomical and physiological techniques are generating massive and perhaps more functionally relevant data, our understanding of the adaptive consequences of many forms of animal life is increasing, and close, although still rather gross, observations of many animals in field conditions are being recorded. (2) Philosophers can contribute to this progress in a variety of ways. Among other things, they can make clearer what conditions must be satis? fied if mental concepts are to be applied correctly, what presuppositions the attribution of "mind" to other animals involves. In this paper, I am going to describe, very generally, the most important of these presuppositions and argue, too briefly, that at least some animals satisfy them. (3) My point of departure is a remark made in passing by Daniel Den? nett towards the end of his problematic and profound book, Consciousness Explained (Dennett 1991, p. 446): Antelopes, in their herds, have no secrets and no way of getting any. So an antelope is probably no more capable of hatching a secret plan than it is capable of counting to a hundred or enjoying the colors of a sunset. (4) I am not at all sure what the qualification "in their herds" is supposed to entail. Otherwise, it is simply false that antelope (at least American antelope or pronghorns) have no secrets, as I can attest on the basis of watching them very carefully over the past 25 years.

(5) For example, a female engages in what is routinely known as "decoy behavior", drawing would-be predators away from the place where her fawn lies hidden in the grass (if the fawn is not already down, the doe will give it a signal to do so), making larger and larger circles in the process, that is, drawing would-be predators away while keeping the fawn under (somewhat distant) surveillance. Indeed, whenever a doe returns to feed its young, she typically "spend[s] some time looking over the area from a high vantage point to be sure that no danger threatens. Once convinced that all is well [and that her behavior will not betray its location], she proceeds to the fawn's bedding-down area" (Van Wormer 1969, p. 58). (6) There is special irony in Dennett's happening to fasten on what he takes to be the inevitable candor of antelope. For among the tribes of the northern Great Plains, whose knowledge of game animals is, under? standably, greatly superior to our culture's, antelope are the emblematic secret-keepers. Thus Pretty Shield, medicine woman of the Crows, in the course of a story designed precisely to illustrate their lack of candor: "The antelope are a strange people...They are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. We do not trust them.. .Ahhh, the antelope are deceivers, not helpers" (Linderman 1932/1972, pp. 114-117). (7) Why, then, in the face of the evidence, does Dennett think that antelope cannot have secrets? Because he is caught in the backwash of theory, in this case his own. For my purposes here, two parts of this theory are particularly import? ant. One is that the having of secrets, like a great deal else of what passes for a mental life, presupposes certain linguistic abilities, among them the ability to make up and tell stories. But antelope do not have these abilities. Therefore, antelope do not/cannot have secrets. The other important part of Dennett's theory is that the having of secrets, like almost all of what passes for a mental life, presupposes the having of beliefs and desires, the belief that one knows something that others do not know, for instance, and the desire not to share it. But antelope do not really have beliefs and desires. Therefore, antelope do not/cannot have secrets. Since these two arguments for the conclusion that antelope do not/cannot have secrets are valid and the conclusion itself is (transparently) false, at least one of the premises in each must be false. It remains to see which. Unfortunately, this will take a little time. (8) Let me begin with the second line of argument. We begin to explain the doe's behavior when we grant that it does not want a would-be predator to know where its young lies hidden and thinks that its decoy-tactics will draw the predator away. That is, we begin to understand the doe's behavior</page><page sequence="3">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 61 when we attribute beliefs and desires to it. At a minimum, having a secret presupposes having certain sorts of intentions. Moreover, to justify the attribution of intentions it is enough that certain easily observable conditions be met. These conditions assure that the beha? vior is purposive. They are met in the doe/fawn case. For a start, the doe's behavior (unlike that of the sphex wasp, for example) is not automatic, it varies as a function of the terrain, the location of the fawn's hiding place, and the movements of the predator. To further test this claim, we could set up experiments to alter the variables, moving the fawn in such a way that the doe but not the predator was alerted to the move, and then watching her behavior.1 It is simply gratuitous to ask at this point, but are the antelope's desires and beliefs just like ours when, protective of our young, we keep secret their hiding places, for there is no more to beliefs and desires, as so far construed, than the explanatory roles they play. These roles do not require any "felt" or phenomenological quality, nor does the animal have to be aware, self-consciously, that it is leading predators astray. For again, at? tributing beliefs and desires does no more than indicate that the behavior is complex and flexible. Dennett puts the point by saying that it is only a question of taking the "intentional stance" with respect to the doe's behavior. As I've already indicated, we are justified in doing so, so long as certain observable con? ditions are met. But it is also the case that we must do so, at least for the foreseeable future. An antelope's behavior is so flexible and complex (a fact not lost on Native American observers) that we can at present explain or anticipate only a small fraction of it if we restrict ourselves to genetic endowment, physiological structure, environmental stimuli, and reinforce? ment schedules, even if we add in the pressures of natural selection and the requirements of survival. That is, we must see the antelope's behavior as purposive, intentional if we are to begin to understand it. But it does not follow from this, according to Dennett, that the doe really has beliefs and desires. At present, some machine behavior, like some animal behavior, is vastly too complex to explain except on some? thing like the intentional model. Confronted with a chess-playing com? puter, to take the usual paradigm, we have no option to ascribing beliefs and desires, and a modicum of rationality, to it in our attempt to understand and anticipate its behavior. But it does not follow that machines really have beliefs. All that is required is to take the "intentional stance" and suppose, for the purposes of explanation, that they do, proceed as z/they had beliefs.2 By the same token, it does not follow from the fact that we</page><page sequence="4">62 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. have, as a matter of practical necessity, provided an intentional explanation of an animal's behavior that it too really has beliefs. As against Dennett, however, this is not the end of the story. Machines, of the conventional sort, cannot have beliefs, no matter how complex and flexible their behavior, for at least two inter-connected reasons. One reason is that to have a belief is to have acquired a behavioral capacity in a par? ticular sort of way, as the result of a personal history; there are no "innate" beliefs. Conventional machines do not acquire any of their behavioral ca? pacity as the result of a personal history, as the result of learning. All of their behavioral capacity is (in some sense of the word) engineered. Hence they cannot have beliefs. Could there be machines which learned? I don't see why not. The point is that our attribution of beliefs to such machines would involve more than taking an intentional stance. The other reason why conventional machines cannot have beliefs is that beliefs must be "grounded" in particular ways. It is always appropriate to ask why one believes something, where the request is for a reason, some? thing that justifies the belief, and not simply for a cause. We have many reasons for believing the things that we do, but inevitably some of these reasons must have to do with our sensory intake. We believe what we do because on at least some occasions we have seen, heard, tasted, touched, or smelled it for ourselves. Lacking any sensory apparatus, machines such as a chess-playing computer cannot "ground" their beliefs in this way, hence they cannot have beliefs. Could there be machines which had some sensory capability? Of course. The point once again is that the attribution of beliefs to such machines would involve more than taking an intentional stance. In her paper in this issue, Jo?lle Proust argues, in fact, that a particular kind of perceptual capacity is required if beliefs and other mental states are to be attributed. An animal must be able to integrate its multisensory perceptions (i.e., the animal must have more than one sensory modality) so as to extract a coherent spatial orientation, a process known as calibration. Whether or not the details of her analysis are correct, the main point (as Kant long ago contended) must surely be right, that only animals able to orient themselves spatially in a coherent way can have "objective" beliefs (hence beliefs tout court) and at least the beginnings of a representation of self. Now it should be clear that many animals, and all mammals, satisfy these two conditions. Although some of their behavioral capacity has been acquired by way of genetic programming, is a matter of "instinct", much of it has also been acquired by way of a personal history, has been "learned". The fact that the behavior in question is adaptive, and thus plays a role in the differential reproduction rate of the individual or of the species or gene</page><page sequence="5">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 63 pool to which it belongs does not entail, even when it is also stereotypical, that its causes lie in its evolutionary history. Presumably a great deal of human behavior which is similarly adaptive can be traced to the beliefs of agents, even when it has become habitual in character. Otherwise, it is easy enough to establish that some animal behavior is learned, although not as easy to draw a sharp line between what is learned and what is instinctive in general. Satisfaction of the second condition, that one who has beliefs must have at least some "grounded" beliefs, and hence have at least some percep? tual capacities, is also obvious. The fact that non-human animals are not themselves capable of "grounding" their own beliefs, by indicating the inferential trail back to the evidence for them, does not entail that none of their beliefs is grounded. For surely human beings hold a variety of "grounded" beliefs, the justifications for which they would be hard-pressed to supply. It follows that the attribution of beliefs to animals is not merely a ques? tion of taking an intentional stance with respect to their behavior. There are important differences in this respect between machines and animals. To this extent, it is legitimate to claim that the latter really have beliefs. At the same time, although these conditions are necessary, they are not also sufficient. Fred Dretske (1988) has argued very persuasively that the ascription of belief is appropriate only if the content of the belief plays a role in the explanation of the behavior, in which case we might say that the belief is "governing" the behavior. Thus the diaphragm of a microphone vibrates rapidly when I say "Vibrate rapidly!" into it. But it is not the meaning my words have which causes the microphone to vibrate rapidly; any other words would have done just as well. This is not to suggest that the "meaning" invoked here must be narrowly linguistic in character and tied to "words". Dretske's point goes through when one thing comes to function as sign or symbol of another, by be? ing associated with it. Rifle fire comes to be associated with danger by the ungulate populations resident in my part of the country, this is what rifle fire means. In which case the local ungulates can be said to have the belief that rifle fire is dangerous and to have their flight when such fire is heard explained intentionally. By the same token, machines which are not capable of such associations cannot rightly be said to have beliefs. Whether these three conditions (and presumably they are tightly bound up, any two presupposing the third) are sufficient is not yet clear to me.3 But the fact that there are such conditions has an important corollary. It is that the attribution of belief is not simply a function of the flexibil? ity and complexity of behavior. Flexibility and complexity of behavior</page><page sequence="6">64 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. forces us, with respect to both animals and machines, to adopt the "in? tentional stance". This stance, in turn, allows us to leave open questions about whether the machines and animals involved really have the beliefs and desires invoked to account for their actions. But these questions be? gin to be closed when we take into consideration other conditions whose satisfaction is publicly observable, but which are not simply "behavioral" in character. We can determine whether the doe acquired at least some of her behavioral capacity in the right sort of way, learning, among other things, which objects in its perceptual field were rightly to be feared and when to break off the decoy-tactics and return to the fawn, and whether the doe has the appropriate sensory capacities (in her case, as much olfactory as visual) and the ability to calibrate them. When in this way we have determined that the doe's behavior is adequately complex and flexible and we have correctly located the acquisition mechanisms of her behavioral capacity (including the ability to orient herself spatially), then we are well on the legitimate way to attribute beliefs to her. The study of animal behavior from at least the time of Descartes to Den? nett and the present day is haunted by the assumption4 that such behavior is "all we have to go on", the only evidence on the basis of which we can ground inferences to what is "going on inside the head" of others. Since in at least some cases their behavior is (or could easily be imagined to be) indistinguishable, Descartes himself concluded that no more was going on "inside" animals than was going on inside machines. This is a mistake. Behavior is not all we have to go on. A number of other considerations having to do with the attribution of belief are also at stake, and they allow us in the first instance to distinguish between animals and machines and in the second to ascribe minds to animals, in both cases moving beyond the "intentional stance". (9) Now let me turn to the first line of argument, that antelope cannot have secrets because having secrets presupposes linguistic abilities and antelope do not have these abilities. In fact, most people who want to attribute thought to animals deny the second premise, that is, they attribute linguistic abilities to animals. But it is difficult to do so without begging a variety of questions, the most important of which is, "what constitutes a language?" Some of those most anxious to deny that animals "speak"5 understand "language" in an im? plausible Chomskyesque way in terms of syntax and a generative grammar, but we are far from having a plausible account of what it is, or being clear about the uses to which such an account might be put. For my purposes it is enough, first, to point out that animals exchange information all of the time (as do antelope when, using sounds and bodily movements, most notably</page><page sequence="7">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 65 flashing their white rump patch, they signal other members of their band of the presence of predators) and, second, to argue (as I will shortly) that they possess and apply concepts. Briefly put, we do not need to attribute "linguistic competence" (in any narrow sense) to other animals in order to defend the claim that they think. That is, the problem lies with the first premise, that having secrets presupposes such competence. To make its denial plausible is the ultimate burden of anyone who wishes to defend animal thought. Shouldering it will require a rather intricate argument. (10) We can begin with the link between having secrets and linguistic competence. It is made by way of the notion of self-consciousness. On the one hand, one cannot have secrets unless one is self-conscious. As I have already indicated, having a secret involves, among other things, having the belief that one knows something that others do not know, a belief about oneself. On the other hand, one cannot be self-conscious unless one can represent oneself, i.e., unless one can represent a representation. But to represent a representation, to be capable of "second-order" representa? tions, is to have concepts, and something like a language in which they are deployed. (11) It is relatively non-controversial, I think, that animals can "rep? resent" the world. That such "representation" takes place would seem to follow immediately from the fact that (some) animals have expectations and memories. The doe sees the predator, and remembers where it last saw its fawn. It moves off a hundred paces, and expects the doe to follow. That a "representation" and not "the world" is controlling the doe's behavior should be clear from the fact that the "representations" in question are of a world not now present. It is, furthermore, in virtue of these "representa? tions" that the doe is able, in context, to act appropriately. That is to say, again following Dretske, that these representations have the same sort of content, and function in the same sort of causal way, as beliefs. This is, I think, how we would naturally and pre-theoretically interpret the doe's behavior. We ascribe memories and expectations, and with them a degree of intentionality, to a variety of other animals without difficulty. But we have to be careful. The mere fact that the sphex wasp returns to her hole or the salmon to its spawning ground does not imply that the wasp or the salmon "remembers" where it is. Does the pronghorn provide us with any evidence that she can recollect (in an act of "episodic memory") where it last saw its fawn, over and above the fact that it returns to it? I am not entirely sure how to answer this question. But let me make two brief points. One is that, unlike the sphex wasp or the salmon, the doe sometimes "forgets" where her young lies hidden and has to comb the area,</page><page sequence="8">66 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. in a more or less systematic way, to find it again (Van Wormer 1969, p. 58) in the same way that we forget where we left our glasses. Presumably the possibility of forgetting implies the possibility of remembering in some strong sense. The other point is that we could, I believe, devise experiments to determine whether the doe is actually recollecting. On one occasion, the doe hides the fawn and moves off. Visual and olfactory contact are broken (pronghorn fawns have no scent, a key adaptive feature). Eventually she returns to the fawn. On a second occasion, she hides the fawn and moves off. In a way that she cannot detect, we move the fawn. She returns to the spot, is clearly puzzled not to find the fawn there, and eventually returns to the place where, on the previous occasion, she did find it. How else could we explain her behavior in this case except to say that she remembered, in an episodic sort of way, where she had last found her fawn, in the same way that we sometimes return to where we remember last finding our glasses? (12) But can we say anything about the content of these representa? tions? In fact, we know a great deal about the perception of animals, not so much, I think, as those native hunters who have accumulated thousands of years of very close survival-dependent observations, but enough for us to get started. We know that cats cannot discriminate colors, but that bees can; the latter can have "representations" that the former cannot. We know, in particular, a number of things about antelope, about their tremendously acute vision,6 their sense of smell and hearing, and the ways in which they remember old sources of water and recent hunting seasons. We are even beginning to differentiate between ungulate species in these terms. And what we know of an antelope's perceptual capacities leads us to understand that it doesn't represent the world in just the way that we do, although we don't have to "get inside" the antelope's head to know this. For starters, we can wander around the landscape with a pair of 8-power binoculars over our eyes and focus our attention on those things which harm or nourish ruminants. Then we can begin, with difficulty, to set up a number of dis? crimination experiments, along the lines of those that Von Frish carried out in the case of bees. There is a sense, of course, in which we can "get inside" the antelope's head, through an understanding of its neurosensory physiology and the development of computer perceptual models. Both of these are in very early stages of development. Indeed, at the present level of our knowledge of how they work, there is not all that much to choose between the antelope and the human brain. But the physiology and the simulations, going hand in hand, will some day cast a good deal of light, eventually strengthening and not undermining or replacing our anthropomorphic explanations.</page><page sequence="9">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 67 A real difficulty for us is that any number of animals, importantly in? cluding antelope, seem to respond to a wider and often much subtler vari? ety of stimuli. It is not enough to emphasize the role played by vision; we must also come to understand the ways in which visual clues are broken down and processed and the information used to reconstruct some sort of visual "picture" in the antelope's mind. But though difficult, this is not impossible, as imaginative writers have already shown in the case of more charismatic species like the wolf (see Cormac McCarthy's The Crossing), and the bear (see Ernest Thompson Seton's more naive, but still interesting Biography of a Grizzly). (13) To this point I have, not surprisingly for those who know me, been following Kant's lead.7 He too argues for attributing desires (if not also beliefs) and "representations" to other animals. The most important of the several passages in which he does so is in the Critique of Judgment (in a footnote to Ak.5: 464): What we can quite correctly infer by analogy, from the similarity between animal beha? vior (whose basis we cannot perceive directly) and man's behavior (of whose basis we are conscious directly), is that animals too act according to presentations [Vorstellungen, "representations" on the usual translation] (rather than being machines, as Descartes would have it), and that regardless of the difference in specific kind between them and men, they are still of the same general kind (namely, as living beings). At least at times, Kant holds that having "representations" presupposes be? ing conscious, and thus that in this sense other animals have consciousness.9 But he also consistently denies that other animals are self-conscious, and thus that they have consciousness in the full, human sense of the term. (14) Kant has a number of reasons for wanting to deny that animals are self-conscious. Most of them have to do with the fact that humans, unlike other animals, are moral agents and can be held responsible for their actions. The conceptual tie between moral agency and self-consciousness is supplied by the fact that although animals have desires, they are not aware that they do and thus cannot consciously choose to act on them or not,10 as we do. Moral agency presupposes freedom, and animals, lacking self-consciousness, are not free. (15) But these reasons for wanting to deny that animals are self conscious do not amount to a proof that they are not, short of begging important questions. In fact, so far as I can tell, Kant has no argument for the claim that animals are not self-conscious, although he repeats the claim on a number of occasions. Apparently he does not think that analogies between our own behavior and that of other animals establish that they, too, are self-conscious in the way that analogies establish that they are conscious. I take it, moreover, that for Kant no analogies between their</page><page sequence="10">68 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. behavior and ours could establish that animals were self-conscious, since all we can infer by analogy on the basis of behavior is that the behaver has "representations", and not that it is further aware of these "represent? ations". But that we cannot establish self-consciousness on the basis of behavior does not prove that animals do not possess it. Kant also says that animals do not possess self-consciousness since they are incapable of making judgments, which involves among other things the application of concepts. This time the link between the application of con? cepts and the possession of self-consciousness is by way of the fact that the possession of self-consciousness involves, at a minimum, distinguishing between how things stand with the subject and how things stand with the world, and this involves the application of concepts. But again, no reasons have been given why other animals cannot apply concepts and thus why they cannot distinguish between how things stand with them and with the world. (16) There is, indeed, something profoundly wrong about the "argu? ment by analogy" which Kant takes to be our way "into" animal minds. It presupposes a mistaken view of the way in which behavior stands to mind. On this "argument", to put it briefly, analogies or similarities between our behavior, as effect, and that of other animals allow us to infer an analogy or similarity between the causes of the behavior, i.e., an inference to a mind more or less like ours. The closer the analogies, the more tenable the inference.11 There are a variety of problems with this sort of "argument". Unlike other arguments by analogy, to the existence and structure of atoms for example, it is impossible in principle to verify its soundness; that is, there is no way in which we can ever verify whether our inference to the mind of another animal is correct. Moreover, the notion of an "analogy" or similarity is of little help, as philosophers of science have long since dis? covered; there will always be an innumerable number of both similarities and dissimilarities between any two pieces of behavior, and only some prior agreement about what constitutes the relevant similarities or dissim? ilarities will provide the foundation for an inference.12 But to assume such prior agreement is already to have "interpreted" the behavior in terms of what it expresses. Most important, the argument from analogy suggests, once again, that the mind is hidden from view, somehow "trapped in? side" the body, and only an inference "from the outside" can reach it, an inference which, we have just noted, can never be justified. But we can justify the attribution of mind, even with respect to species which seem to be dissimilar to us in many ways. It is a question of "read? ing" their behavior, in the same sort of way that we read a text.13 For just</page><page sequence="11">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 69 as a text does not stand to its author as effect to cause or conclusion to premise, requiring in either case that some sort of inference from the one to the other must be made and justified, so too the behavior of an antelope is an expression of its mind. It is all a question of interpretation. The text is not a "report" on the author's mind whose accuracy, in the nature of the case, can never be verified. In the same way, when we properly interpret some animal's behavior, locating it in a present environment and past his? tory, there is little room for asking, yes, but does this really signify a mind? The behavior itself, contextually understood, answers that question. Return to the antelope doe. What is crucial about her behavior, what compels us to construe it as intelligent, is that she redirects it in ways that are, from an easily understood point of view, rational. It is unnecessary at this point to ask whether the behavior really is intelligent, or to wonder whether a mind is somehow responsible for it. Still less is it necessary to argue on the basis of presumed analogies between her behavior and our own that what is "going on inside her" is like what is going on inside us when we act intelligently. Interpretation depends on the assumption that other things are equal, in the antelope doe case that there are not other "non-mental" factors respons? ible for her behavior.14 To the extent possible, experiments must be carried out to test this assumption. It turns out, for example, that much of the behavior of bees which appears intelligent can be explained more directly in terms of hard-wiring and automatic responses to chemical changes in the environment. To this extent, bees do not have minds. Similarly, the in? terpretation of situations involving an animal's approach to or withdrawal from a type of object depends on ruling out alternative explanations before deciding that the animal either likes or dislikes (has feelings about) an object or, particularly appropriate in the case of antelope, is very curious about it. One might contend at this point that we still do not "really know" what it is like to be an antelope, cannot get "inside" its head. There are two points to be made in this connection. One is that there is no difference in this respect between human beings and other animals, and this is all that is necessary for the purposes of my argument. In the sense indicated, we cannot "get inside" the head of other human beings either. The other point is that we can, and often do, "get inside" the heads of both human beings and other animals. We "read" the behavior of those around us all the time, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, through the behavioral texts they supply us with and our knowledge of the appropriate contexts.15 Reading texts, whether verbal or behavioral, and "entering into" minds are two as? pects of one and the same activity. Experienced trainers are especially good</page><page sequence="12">70 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. at "reading" animals, but anyone who has lived in close proximity to a pet for a number of years becomes good at it out of personal necessity.16 What is "subjective", at the core of consciousness for many people, is measured by the distance between the world described by the text produced and what might be described as the "real" world. What counts as the "real" world is going to vary; to claim our ordinary image of things as reality would be unduly anthropocentric. But we don't need to. We will know about an animal's "subjective" picture of things to the extent that it differs, on interpretation, from that produced by the majority of its kind. (17) Nor is there, I believe, any insurmountable difficulty in attributing concepts to other animals in the absence of language. One line of argu? ment, Donald Davidson's (1982) is that "having the concept" of X involves not simply being able to discriminate between X's and non-X's, but also having a number of beliefs about X's. Although the antelope doe can dis? tinguish between predator and prey, at least up to a point, she does not "have the concept" of predator, for "having the concept" involves having a number of beliefs about predators, in terms of which we can identify predators as predators, in the process distinguishing them from other ob? jects which are not dangerous, which may be eaten, and so on. The only way in which these various beliefs can themselves be distinguished, their particular content identified, is with respect to the sentences that express them. But I have admitted that the doe is not capable of sentences. In which case it does not really have the concept of a predator. In which case it does not really have any beliefs about predators, in particular about the one in view which should be led away from its fawn. Although, faute de mieux, we might attribute "beliefs" to explain and anticipate its behavior, this is no more than a fa?on de parler and should not be taken seriously. This line of argument is not persuasive. For one thing, it does not recog? nize that the identification of objects as such is a matter of degree, and often a matter of context. The wildlife biologist, the hunter, the man in the street all have a number of beliefs about predators. Presumably these beliefs are not the same. Does it follow that they have different concepts of what it is to be a predator, to the point where we can say confidently that their beliefs are not really about predators? But if it is a matter of degree, and there is no principled way in which to list a body of beliefs as necessary and sufficient for one to have the concept of predator, then there would seem to be no reason whey the antelope couldn't have some concept of predator (although we would have to identify that concept in our language), and to that extent beliefs about it. That the word "belief" is correctly used here is underlined by the fact that an antelope could believe there was a predator</page><page sequence="13">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 71 in the neighborhood when we had, in fact, killed it; that is, the belief in this sort of case clearly has the "aboutness" characteristic of intentionality. For another thing, although we identify beliefs by way of sentences, there is something highly problematic about using this fact to argue that insofar as an animal is incapable of sentences, it is incapable of beliefs. Except during philosophical colloquia, we assume that we understand one another when we speak, and thus that in uttering a sentence we at the same time identify the content of a particular belief. But assume that we do not, at least initially, understand one another. How do we come to some sort of mutual understanding? Brian Skyrms (1996) has begun to spell part of the explanation out in terms of sender-receiver games, Nash equilibria, and evolutionary dynamics. At a very basic level, of course, we come to understand each other by mutually interpreting our behavior, including what might be called our "verbal" (written, spoken, and "body language") behavior. But this interpretation requires, on Davidson's account, that we attribute any number of other beliefs before we can attribute the possession of concepts to them and attach meanings to their behavior. That is, we must ascribe any number of beliefs (inevitably our own) to them before we can ascribe a language in terms of which these beliefs are to be identified. And what justifies such ascription in the case of human beings, for example an imagined primitive people whose beliefs are few in number and relatively simple ("predator" for them might indicate any large, powerful animal) and not in the case of at least some other animals if it is not a prejudice in favor of human beings from the outset, that they have a mental life simply in virtue of sharing a common physiognomy? (18) Whatever else might be said for it, the trade-off between ("lin? guistic") meaning and belief on which Davidson's argument turns does not provide any sort of empirical way into the question, "when, if ever, is it reasonable to ascribe concepts to other animals?" A more promising line to take with regard to this question has been worked out by Colin Allen (1999). On Allen's account, to put it very briefly, an animal has a concept of X just in case (1) the animal systematically discriminates some instances of X from non-Xs, (2) the animal is capable of detecting some of its own discrimination errors between Xs and non-Xs, and (3) the animal is cap? able of learning to better discriminate Xs from non-Xs as a consequence of this capacity. What is crucial here is that for an animal to have this capacity would seem to entail that it has some sort of "internal standard of comparison", a representation of the world that is independent of any present perceptual representation. Such internal representations, "maps by means of which we steer" David Armstrong calls them, bid fair to be called</page><page sequence="14">72 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. "concepts;" at least they do much of the same sort of work in explaining behavior. I have already argued that many ("languageless") animals must possess representations of the world independent of present perceptual informa? tion. That they play much the same sort of role as concepts follows from the fact that many of these same animals satisfy Allen's three conditions. The antelope doe, for example, is capable not simply of distinguishing between predators and non-predators in some general way, but also of gradually refining this distinction, learning over time which animals in its environ? ment are rightly to be feared and gradually correcting any initial errors she might have made.17 But again, such correction presupposes some sort of standard, a concept of predator, against which comparisons can be made and behavior regulated. (19) At long last we can ask, "are any non-human animals self conscious?" Dennett suggests something like the following argument: (i) The self is the subject of "narrative gravity" (too briefly, the self is the subject of stories we tell about ourselves, a convenient if also necessary fiction), (ii) Narratives or stories exist only when there is a language in which they can be developed or told, (iii) Other animals lack language, (iv) Therefore, other animals cannot be the subjects of their own narratives or stories, (v) Therefore, other animals do not have a self, (vi) Therefore, other animals cannot be self-conscious.18 I have done what I can to downplay the role of linguistic competence gen? erally. Animals exchange information about themselves, signaling whether or not, for example, they are ready to play, they possess and employ con? cepts, they are intentional agents, the content of whose beliefs and desires is expressed in their behavior. What more can be said about what Dennett calls their "selfy selves"? (20) The first point is that a "selfy self" must involve some sort of self recognition, the ability to identify oneself among others of one's kind. Such self-recognition can be ascribed to at least some animals, on grounds that have nothing to do with linguistic competence. The pioneering work of Gallup, for example, has shown that chimpanzees and orangutans can learn to recognize mirror images as representations of their own and not another animal's body.19 If having a concept or sense of self (or being able to "represent" oneself or to refer to oneself) involves being able to distinguish between self and other, then these animals clearly have a sense of self, and in this respect are "self-conscious". Are they aware that they are prim</page><page sequence="15">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 73 ates, among many other things? Presumably not. But "self-consciousness" is necessarily a matter of degree. Certainly we are not completely self conscious, as individuals or as members of a species. Not all primates recognize their mirror images. Since there is otherwise no reason to think that they are any less self-conscious than chimpanzees and orangutans, we have to say that mirror self-recognition is a sufficient, but not also a necessary condition of attributing a sense of self. Members of other species indicate that they have a self in other ways. One which intrigues me is the grizzly habit of seeking out positions from which it can see without being seen (Griffin 1992, p. 249). Grizzlies apparently make a special effort to get their entire body behind the available rocks or vegetation, as if they had some conception of themselves as wholes. Kant insists on the importance of spatial and temporal orientation as a condition on the representation of self.20 But many animals can orient themselves spatially, none more dramatically than a cat tossed into the air. Many of these same animals orient themselves temporally, with respect to memory and expectation. Other philosophers insist on the importance of some sort of interior or "private" life as the key to a "selfy self". But the fact that the antelope doe has secrets (or for that matter that the bear "conceals" itself) already entails the beginnings of a "private" life, something which the animal believes and chooses not to reveal. Self-consciousness, like consciousness, is a matter of degree. Dennett would agree. But much more than I he wants to emphasize the importance of "language" in generating the possibility of selfy selves and thus he is wary of the notion of animal self-consciousness. Language is important in the case of our own "selfishness". But as the chimpanzee, bear, cat, and antelope cases I sketched very briefly indicate, we can begin to make out and apply a concept of a "selfy self" without it. (21) The second point is that self-consciousness, like consciousness, is a forensic concept. By that I mean that our question must not be, "what is the self?" (a rather hopeless question) but, "to what purposes can the concept of the self be put?" Dennett gives it some very interesting work to do, almost all of it, apparently, related to the requirements of survival; I have to know about what is subject to my will and what resists, about the nature and limit of my abilities, and so on, if I am to reproduce myself successfully. Such self-knowledge, however, is at stake only in the case of intelligent agents whose behavior can be informed by this knowledge, i.e., in the case of agents who are able to "make choices". Not all animals are intentional agents, that is, it is not appropriate to explain their beha? vior in terms of desires and beliefs. Hence not all animals have any use</page><page sequence="16">74 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. for self-knowledge and a "representation" of self which this knowledge presupposes. But other animals, among them all mammals, do have use for self-knowledge, however unable they are to center the self at stake in a "narrative". (22) The third point is that in denying other animals anything like a "self" of which it can be conscious, we preclude the possibility of under? standing them. In the case of lobster, to choose one of Dennett's favorites, there is very little to understand. Their behavior is primitive and so far as we have been able to make out, largely automatic; an account in terms of input, output, and the hard-wiring that links the two suffices. To put this another way, we do not have to put ourselves in the place of the lobster in order to understand its behavior. But this is not the case with respect to many other animals. That is, we have to put ourselves in their place, look at things from their point of view, and so on, if we are to anticipate and eventually explain their actions. But this is possible only if there is a "self" whose place we can occupy, if only in our imagination, a self like us in certain ways and unlike us in others, but a "selfy self" all the same. In denying "selves" to other animals we forego, as the Indians of the northern Great Plains did not, the tremendous explanatory resources involved in modelling their behavior on ours. Is it advisable to attribute to them "selves" in all the richness of our description of ourselves, as the Indians do? Probably not, but the excessive puritanism of our currently allowable descriptions of them is debilitating and it is, in fact, still possible for them to be centers of cautious narrative gravity, even if the narratives are in part of our own making. (23) As I write this, three horses beneath my study window are pawing for grass through the snow. I have already chased them away several times from a bird feeder near our house. Not surprisingly, they like the taste of sunflower seeds. The first couple of times, they came right back, only to be chased away again. Now they are edging closer and closer to the feeder, very slowly and indirectly, pretending that they're intent on the grass, without the slightest thought of the seeds, hoping that I won't notice. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am grateful to J. W. Allard, P. Bandyopadyay, James Bower, and D. C. Dennett for their very helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.</page><page sequence="17">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 75 NOTES 1 Carolyn Ristau has conducted field studies of injury-feigning in piping plovers (the broken-wing display) to determine whether the behavior is intentional or not. She con? cludes on the basis of a variety of interesting observations that the plovers purposely lead intruders away from their nests and modify their behavior in order to do so. My much less careful observations of antelope exactly match hers. See (Ristau 1991). Perhaps ironically, these studies were first suggested to Ristau by Dennett. 2 See Hendrichs (1999, p. 156): "Many mammals - of a wide range of mental organiza? tion, from deer and antelopes to cats - show a behavior of hiding their intentions when they feel detected, that is, when alerted keep on grazing, changing the direction of movement when approaching the hiding place of their calf, or demonstrating that there are no hunting intentions when detected by the approached prey. All the intentional terms used here - hiding, demonstrating, cheating - are 'as if descriptions by the observer". 3 They certainly were to Hume, who makes the case for animal belief depend on their joint satisfaction. See Hume (1902). 4 Which is much more critical to our misunderstanding of mind than the "Cartesian theater" of which Dennett makes so much. See Consciousness Explained, passim. 5 For example, see Steven Pinker (1996, Chap. 11). 6 A fact that could have been inferred without further information from their adaptation to largely treeless plains. 7 Put on to it by Jill Buroker, who referred me to Steve Naragon's immensely interesting paper (Naragon 1990), on which I draw heavily in what follows. 8 To say that they are "living beings" is, moreover, to characterize their behavior as purposive, in which case an intentional pattern of explanation is appropriate. 9 See the lectures on Logic (Ak. 9: 64-65) and Kant's letter to Marcus Herz of 26 May 1789. There are also passages in which he denies that animals have consciousness. For instance, in the 1775 lectures grouped under the title Philosophical Encyclopedia (Ak. 29: 44-45): "The main, and nearly the only difference between animals and humans is consciousness, but that is also so great that it can never be replaced with something else. Many animals behave and build so craftily that they come quite close to humans, but all are without consciousness". To reconcile all of these passages it is enough to point out that Kant uses "consciousness" as we tend to do, in an elastic way, at times equating it with "self-consciousness", at other times limiting it to the having of "representations". See Patricia Kitcher (1984). 10 See Kant (1986, p. 231): "For there is in cattle, as well as in man, that remarkable faculty we call imagination, the principle of perception and motion, by which things that are absent can really exist in the soul as though they were present, as can things that never have been and perhaps never can be. But in cattle, this force is not directed by any choice or deliberate intention of the animal, but is put into play by stimuli and impulsions implanted by nature itself, apart from any influence of the will". Also Herder's notes from Kant's course in metaphysics during the period 1762-1774 (Ak. 28: 99): "The animals (by hypothesis) have a faculty to act according to choice, but they cannot represent to themselves the grounds of motion: they are not conscious so as to [be able to] act according to a desire for this choice". 11 Marian Stamp Dawkins (1993, p. 12) is entirely typical: "Our problem with other an? imals, then, is to decide whether other species are similar enough to ourselves that the argument from analogy - or some modified version of it - still holds. Can we enter their</page><page sequence="18">76 GORDON G. BRITTAN, JR. worlds when those worlds are likely to be far different from ours than other people's will be?" Since there are many more similarities than differences, in her view, the answer to this last question is "yes". Aside from the bankrupt appeal to the "argument by analogy", Dawkins' book contains a great deal of interesting, very accessible, material. Is the fact that bears sometimes go on two legs relevantly similar to our behavior? Some native traditions seem to have thought so. But can it serve to ground an inference to a human-type mind? 13 Following some suggestions of Dennett (1982, pp. 159-160) although with very differ? ent results. As should by now be clear, he thinks that an inquiry into animal consciousness is much more problematic than I do. 1 To begin with, we have to establish that the behavior is that of an intentional agent, an agent whose behavior can be explained in terms of beliefs and desires acquired in the right sorts of ways and leading to effects in the right sorts of ways. In a famous phrase, Aldo Leopold invites us to "think like a mountain". We all know what he's getting at, but taken literally, the invitation makes little sense. Mountains are not intentional agents, hence cannot express anything, hence cannot reveal their thoughts and feelings. There is nothing it is to think like a mountain, although there is something it is to think like an antelope, a fact not lost on those who hunt them. 15 Note that we establish right and wrong readings of a literary text not by determining whether our reading matches what is going on inside the head of the author (impossible in any case if the author is dead or reclusive), but in a variety of other ways, some of them having to do with coherence and context, which allow us to establish its "meaning". 16 When I took psychology in college, most of the lab time was spent running rats in mazes. When the rats did not behave as conditioned - in fact, when placed in the maze they often just sat there, looking around idly - they were removed, that particular trial was voided, and another rat was introduced. There was no attempt to "read" the behavior of the recalcitrant, still less any inclination to concede that they had "minds". Everything could be explained by reference to reinforcement schedules, so long as the rat did its part. 17 Marc Bekoff (1999) points out that such "error detection" is particularly obvious in animal play, as when one animal comes to understand that it is playing "too rough" and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 18 "Language ... plays an enormous role in the structuring of a human mind, and the mind of a creature lacking language - and having really no need for language - should not be supposed to be structured in these ways...When we imagine what it is like to be a languageless creature, we start, naturally, from our own experience, and most of what then springs to mind has to be adjusted (mainly downward). The sort of consciousness such animals enjoy is dramatically truncated, compared to ours. A bat, for instance, not only can't wonder whether it's Friday; it can't even wonder whether it's a bat; there is no role for wondering to play in its cognitive structure. While a bat, like even the lowly lobster, has a biological self, it has no selfy self to speak of..." (Dennett 1991, pp. 447-448). 19 See Gallup (1983). More material of this kind, with extensive references, can be found in Griffin (1992, Chap. 12). 20 Of course, Kant, like Hume, thinks that the self as such cannot be represented.</page><page sequence="19">THE SECRETS OF ANTELOPE 77 REFERENCES Allen, Colin: 1999, 'Animal Concepts Revisited', Erkenntnis 51, 537-544.
