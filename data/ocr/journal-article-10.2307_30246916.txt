<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KIVA 31 AN ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE YAMPA AND GREEN RIVERS GORDON C. BALDWIN In May, 1942, the writer was detailed by the National Park Service to assist in an archeological reconnaissance of a section of the Yampa and Green Rivers in Dinosaur National Monument in northwestern Colorado and northeastern Utah.' The principal purpose of this survey was to determine the approximate number, extent, and scien- tific importance of any prehistoric or historic Indian ruins located in areas that would be flooded by the possible future construction of dams along these two rivers. The area covered by this survey included a small part of the upper Yampa River valley in the vicinity of Juniper Mountain and the entire Yampa and Green River canyons from Lily Park in western Colorado to Jensen, Utah. The latter part of the trip was made by boat down one hundred miles of these two rough and turbulent rivers through some of the most isolated, rugged, and scenic canyons in the west. Sheer red and white sandstone and limestone cliffs rise almost straight up from the very edge of the river, towering from 500 to more than 1600 feet overhead. The average elevation of the river through these canyons is about 5200 feet above sea level. Vege- tation is somewhat limited in many of the canyons due to lack of available ground in which to take root, but, wherever possible, sage- brush, box-elder, and juniper thickly carpet the area and a few pines cluster on the benches and higher slopes. The archeological survey was concentrated in three major areas: (1) the Juniper Springs section of the upper Yampa River at the site of the proposed Juniper Mountain Dam, (2) the Yampa River canyon from Lily Park to the junction with the Green River at the 1Members of the party included Frank M.

In the brief time at the disposal of the party a total of thirty prehistoric and historic Indian ruins were discovered and explored. These consisted of small open campsites, rockshelters, cave ruins, storage bins, petroglyph areas, and large surface sites. Most of these sites fall into a generalized Basketmaker-Pueblo culture, distantly related to the Anasazi culture of southern Utah and northern Arizona, while a few sites can be allocated to the historic Ute occupation of the area. However, a num- ber of campsites could not be definitely placed as to culture. In the Juniper Springs area five campsites were discovered along the first broad terrace above the river. These extensive areas were marked by numerous fragments of chert, oval quartzite rubbing and handstones, small flat metates, snub-nosed end scrapers, small circular side scrapers, large triangular to leaf-shaped blades, and pieces of large rough blades. At one site were traces of a number of stone-filled fireplaces. No evidence was found of pottery, stone axes, or house structures. These five areas may represent very early camp- sites as they are at present eroding out of old river terraces. About twenty archeological sites were located in Yampa Canyon, being concentrated in the only three open parks sufficiently large for human habitation. Several of these ruins merit particular atten- tion. Moss Shelter, located in Harding Hole about 25 miles below Lily Park, is a large rockshelter or cave situated on the south bank about 200 feet above the river. The approach is up a very steep, moss- covered slope. The shelter itself is about 100 yards in length and from 10 to 30 feet in width, with a high arching roof. About twelve circular house floors were located in the cave, roughly outlined by boulders and ranging from 8 to 16 feet in diameter. Formerly these were covered by a tipi-like arrangement of box-elder poles and brush, from 50 to 75 of these 10 to 15 foot poles being found loose in the debris. These floors are quite shallow, being covered by only a few inches of loose sand; on one floor was a coating of pine needles. Materials found in Moss Shelter include the following: numerous fragments of chert; two complete snub-nosed end scrapers; two small</page><page sequence="3">THE KIVA 33 triangular arrowpoints with a concave base and no notches; three corncobs, one having the base pierced for the insertion of a small stick; a notched wooden foreshaft 812 inches in length and Â¼ to 3/8 inches in diameter; and several worked pieces of wood, including one awl-like object with sharpened point. Pottery has previously been reported from this shelter. It is possible that this shelter represents a late prehistoric Ute site. Directly across the river from Moss Shelter was a large cave termed Signature Cave from the numerous names painted on the back wall by visitors during the past seventy-five years. This cave measures some 70 feet in width, 90 feet in depth, and from 10 to 18 feet in height. The roof is smoke-blackened and the floor thickly covered with wind-blown sand, fallen sandstone blocks, and cultural material. A number of tests indicated a relatively deep deposit of sand, juniper bark, and grass packed in layers, together with innumerable artifacts. The following types were uncovered: fishbones, chert fragments, worked pieces of wood, two-strand bark cordage, sections of leather sole showing rawhide stitching, twisted rabbit fur, and a small oval rubbing stone. At Castle Park, about 8 miles below the above mentioned sites, ruins were more common than at any other single spot along the river. At least nine sites were definitely located in this extensive park- like area and doubtless others are still to be found there. One of the largest of these, Cliff Canyon Cave, was excavated in 1939 and 1940 by the National Park Service. This is a very important site, with numerous storage bins, basket and stone granaries, and house remains representing several different periods of occupation. Cultural material recovered consisted of coarse gray pottery, corn, squash, basketry, matting, spear points, and knife blades. Other ruins in this area included several small rockshelters with storage bins, two small caves with thick floor deposits, several surface sites, and a number of extensive petroglyph areas. At the northern end of Castle Park is a large rockshelter, Marigold Shelter, with three rectangular house sites outlined with stone, and a zigzag petroglyph above them. At the western end of this shelter, on an upper ledge</page><page sequence="4">34 THE KIVA extremely difficult of access, were two excellent, hard-packed clay floor areas, one with a well-defined, rectangular, stone-lined fireplace. Near one end of the ledge was a small mud and rock storage bin or granary, with the interior divided by wattle-work walls into four compartments. Near the other end of the ledge were what appeared to be the remains of a second granary. At the junction of the Green and Yampa Rivers, 12 miles down- stream from Castle Park, and in Poole Creek Canyon extending southward, seven more ruins were located. Just above the junction on the north side of the Yampa numerous thick ash deposits, with scattered flint chippings, notched arrowpoints, scrapers, fragments of flat metates and manos, and a single gray, sand-tempered potsherd, represented old living areas. Across the river at the base of the eastern cliff were a small rock storage bin and a small rockshelter with a stone-lined cist. In Poole Creek Canyon, in addition to a small rockshelter, storage bins, and extensive surface sites, there was an unusual panel of petro- glyphs, interesting because the designs were not pecked in the rock by the usual method of more or less solid lines but were done by a series of small circular dots. These figures were extremely elaborate, depicting headdresses and masks, crescentic forms, and what ap- peared to be a butterfly design. Five miles below the junction of the Green and Yampa Rivers, Jones Creek flows into the former from the north. Up this well- watered side canyon are several small cave sites and a number of petroglyphs, the latter being painted in red and denoting both human and animal forms. Several other extensive series of petroglyphs occur a short distance downstream at Rainbow Park. Both human and animal figures occur, with excellent representations of the bison, the bison motive also being used in elaborate headdress. One panel shows an excellent representation of a typical Pueblo hump-backed flute player, Kokopelli, a figure common further to the south in the main Pueblo area, but something of a rarity in northern Utah. In summing up the results of this preliminary archeological sur- vey, while not a great many ruins were found along the Yampa and</page><page sequence="5">THE KIVA 35 Green River canyons, those that did occur revealed a number of in- teresting features. It is evident that in an area such as this, with deep canyons and relatively few opportunities for the practise of agricul- ture on a large scale, there was a definite limit imposed on the num- ber and size of villages. Consequently the majority of the archeologi- cal sites throughout the area are usually small and widely scattered. Sites appear to range from an early period somewhat similar to the Basketmaker to the south, down through a Pueblo period to the present-day Ute Indians who today may be found just to the west. Yet, while the essential features of this northern culture seem to be clearly derived from the Anasazi area to the south, there does not appear to be direct correlation with the Basketmaker-Pueblo periods as they are known in the San Juan area and further south. Such cultural features as agriculture, the cultivation of several varieties of corn and squash, stone and mud storage bins and gran- aries, masonry houses, type of fireplace structure, fur and feather cloth, pottery, flat metate, and certain forms of petroglyphs, as the hump-backed flute player, definitely indicate southern origins for the basic elements. The culture lacked, however, such characteristic Anasazi traits as domesticated cotton, the loom, twilled ring baskets, grooved stone axes and mauls, sandal types, and such pottery forms as pitchers, ladles, canteens, and highly decorated wares, particularly polychromes. Also there seems to have been some admixture of ele- ments and ideas from other surrounding areas and a considerable amount of purely local developments. The elaborate petroglyphs, occurring in such abundance through the region, represent one of the most striking and characteristic ele- ments of this northern area. Anthropomorphic figures are especially common, as well as human figures with exceedingly elaborate head- dresses, geometric designs, deer, bison, and mountain sheep. Many of these designs seem to have been derived from Basketmaker proto- types, as the triangular-bodied figures, although in this area the art has been greatly developed over anything found in the San Juan and other areas to the south. As previously mentioned, information on the prehistory of the</page><page sequence="6">36 THE KIVA Yampa and Green River areas is extremely limited. Further surveys such as this and particularly excavation projects should add greatly to our knowledge and we can then more clearly delineate the various cultural horizons in this Northern Periphery of the Southwest.</page></plain_text>
