<plain_text><page sequence="1">Educational Research Bulletn APRIL 13, 1938 Techniques for Test Construction N THE past, teachers have played an insignificant r8le in the evaluation of the effectiveness of educational programs. The construction of tests, the development of record forms, and the determination of what records to keep have most fre- quently been the responsibility of school administrators and, in many cases, have been greatly influenced by individuals out- side the local school system. Where teachers share the responsibility of determining pur- poses, where they play an important part in determining what records to keep, and where they carry the major burden of the evaluation work, they frequently feel the need for technical assistance. This assistance seems to be effective to the degree that the objectives are clarified, that purposes are sharpened, and that, as a result, teachers are able to see in the everyday behavior of their students significant aspects of personality. In the early years of this venture in evaluation which is a part of the Eight-Year Study of the Progressive Education Association, much reliance was placed upon "anecdotal records." These were supposed to be informal records of pupil behavior. The teachers were to write brief reports on things that had actually happened in the classroom and which they considered important. Teachers often complained that they did not have time to do this, and they raised many other objections concerning the reliability and validity of such records. Even more frequent than these complaints, however, came the questions: What shall we write about? What is important? To help teachers answer these questions for themselves, great emphasis was placed upon discussions of objectives; but even this did not meet the situa- tion because many teachers showed great verbal fluency in stating their purposes and little discrimination in the actual observation of their students. To improve in observation seemed to be highly correlated with continued practice in stating 85</page><page sequence="2">86 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN objectives in terms of student behavior. Where the objective had become so concrete that it could be illustrated many times by activities which boys and girls actually carried out in the classroom, teachers had little difficulty in recognizing behavior that was worth writing about. This sharpening of the powers of observation was also increased by knowledge of the tech- niques of evaluating student achievement. In this issue of the BULLETIN, the writer has described three techniques for constructing evaluation instruments relating to different aspects of thinking. Teachers who understand these methods for making tests will certainly be in a better position to approve or disapprove their inclusion in the evaluation pro- gram. They will be better able to appraise many tests which purport to evaluate such intangibles as thinking. Even more important than this, however, is the hope that teachers who understand what behavior is to be appraised, and how that evaluation is to be done, will be much more alert and much more discriminating in their observations of students, and hence, much more effective in guiding their students. Measuring the Ability to Apply Scientific Principles VALUATION of a student's ability to apply principles pre- supposes some definition of the word. As herein used, principles are thought of as general propositions, or as generalizations of experience which man has made in an attempt to make order of the universe for purposes of prediction, expla- nation, or control of events. Principles vary with respect to their usefulness in satisfying these purposes. Many principles in the physical sciences are more exact and can be better used for predicting results than in the social sciences. In all fields, however, there are generalizations of some value which teachers hope their students will learn and apply. Since the ability to apply principles is common, ways of evaluating are important. How do students most frequently use principles? John Dewey says that intelligence is concerned with foreseeing the future so that action may have order and direction. It is also concerned with principles and</page><page sequence="3">APRIL I3, 1938 87 criteria of judgment. . . . Principles are methods of inquiry and fore- cast which require verification by the event. . . . Principles exist as hypotheses with which to experiment.' Most people will agree with Mr. Dewey that a common use of principles is in the prediction of events-foretelling what prob- ably will happen in particular circumstances. Principles are also commonly used to explain an event which has already hap- pened.2 Most schools emphasize this aspect of the application of principles. Students are asked frequently to explain why a particular event happened and are further requested to discuss their answers in detail. It is safe to generalize that students make most frequent use of their knowledge in explaining why something happened, or in predicting what probably will hap- pen and then justifying that prediction or explanation with reasonable arguments. What are the pitfalls, the common errors which students most frequently make when the ability to apply principles is imperfectly developed? The following description is made from the judgments of many teachers and from a study of many essay papers written by students. First, we find students who do not know the principles which are involved. They were in the same classroom with the other students who know them, but they either did not learn them or learned them and forgot them. Second, students sometimes cannot see that a given principle applies in the particular situation which has been pre- sented to them. And third, there are some students who are able to tell what did happen (explain) or can tell what will happen (predict), but they cannot tell why; and when they attempt explanation or justification of their decision, they come to grief for many reasons. An analysis of written papers showed that students often give false reasons, and even more frequently they give irrele- vant reasons for their predictions. Quite frequently, they assume what they were supposed to prove, and it is common to find them relying upon weak or even spurious authorities. They frequently use rather poor analogies, and misconceptions of truth, including superstitions, are to be found among their 1 Dewey, John. Human Nature and Conduct. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1922. pp. 238-39- 2 In explaining what has happened, or in predicting what might happen, students make use of facts and definitions in addition to principles. For the purpose of this discus- sion, emphasis has been placed upon the word "principles."</page><page sequence="4">88 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN arguments. They often ridicule a position and assume that this is a defense of their own, and some students blithely justify their own convictions by arguing that any other conclu- sion is ridiculous. In some situations they are prone to advance teleological arguments for the activities of plants, and animals other than man, and sometimes they even attribute purpose to inanimate objects. More common, perhaps, than anything so far mentioned is the disposition of many students to give only one fact or principle when adequate explanation of the event calls for one or more additional comments. Still another type of error which is common may be de- scribed as inconsistencies in reasoning or confusing the impli- cations of a prediction or explanation. Students show this confusion by choosing a prediction or explanation and then sup- porting it with reasons which explain a different conclusion. ESSAY tests are commonly used to get evidence concerning the student's ability to apply principles. The teacher knows what principles he is teaching, and he can describe some situations in which one or more of the principles operate, and ask the student to write out his prediction and his reasons for the prediction. This method is time-consuming for the student; it limits the number of principles to be tested and the number of situations in which any one principle is to be tested. The teacher often finds the essay difficult to score, and there is always the likelihood that other characteristics of the essay-the hand- writing, the neatness of the paper, the grammatical construction, and perhaps the mere length of the discussion-will distract his attention from scoring the particular ability being tested-the ability to apply facts, principles, and definitions in situations new to the students. Sometimes a teacher must infer what a student means, from what he has written, because of a lack of clarity of statement. All sorts of subjective factors enter into this kind of evaluation and make it probably less accurate and certainly more wasteful of time and energy than another re- cently developed method. While a number of procedures have been developed for objectively testing the ability of students to apply facts, prin- ciples, and definitions to situations which are new, this paper will deal with only one method, which was developed experi- mentally. Students who did well on the essay tests used in the</page><page sequence="5">APRIL 13, 1938 89 experiment also did well on the tests made according to the plan to be outlined. Students who did poorly in the essay exam- inations also did poorly on the objective examination. The correlation was consistently above .83. This rather high corre- lation suggests that the new method is a good index of the ability to apply facts, principles, and definitions in new situa- tions, in so far as pencil-and-paper responses are concerned. The reader must remember, of course, that while the short-cut or objective type of test will give with considerable accuracy the rank of the student in class according to his ability to apply principles, and while it may indicate some of his shortcomings, the test will not reveal what a particular student would actually write in his essay form. T HE procedures in devising an objective test for the evalua- tion of the ability to apply principles involve the following steps. The first is to select the facts, principles, and definitions to be tested. The teacher may select these from the materials currently being taught in the classroom or from subjects which have been studied by the student some time during his school career. Because of limitations of testing time, the teacher will perhaps want to select only the most important principles, facts, and definitions which have been taught. The second step consists in setting up some problem in which the principles, facts, and definitions apply. This problem is usually referred to as a situation. The setting in which the principles apply should be new to the student; that is, it has not been taught in the classroom. The situation should be so described that questions can be asked regarding what will or did happen. Naturally, the problems or situations ought to be interesting to students, ought to be vital in the sense that they are important in the lives of students, and ought to be within the range of student experience. In the third step, the teacher presents two or more plausible alternative answers. The student is directed to check those which are most consistent with the facts given and most reason- able in the light of whatever knowledge he may possess. Instead of asking the student to write out the reasons for his answers, the objective test should include a list of reasons from which the student can choose from the plausible ones presented those which he believes explain or support the con-</page><page sequence="6">90go EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN clusions. Formulating these reasons constitutes the fourth step in the procedure of test-making. Experience has shown that the teacher can save time by thinking of the most reasonable conclusions and then writing out all the reasons for believing the conclusions to be best. The teacher may then take each of the other conclusions and do the same for it. When she has supplied reasons for each conclusion, they should all be put together in a scrambled order. The test is now complete and ready to give to the students.3 T HE procedure applied to an actual situation is shown in the following description. The teacher in question was con- cerned with materials relating to health and particularly those dealing with the growth of bacteria. She wanted the children to understand that the souring of milk is the result of the growth and life processes of bacteria which are retarded by low temperatures. She wrote out the problem in this fashion: In warm weather [a woman] who does not have a refrigerator sometimes wraps her bottle of milk in a wet towel and places it where there is a good circulation of air. Assuming that the temperature is high and that the humidity is low, would a bottle of milk, wrapped in a wet towel and placed where the air was circulating, stay sweet as long as g similar bottle of milk without a wet towel.P In thinking of the conclusions which students might come to after reading this problem, the teacher listed these three: The bottle wrapped with the wet towel would stay sweet: a. longer than the other bottle ........( )a b. not so long as the other bottle . . .. . ( )b c. the same length of time-the wet towel would make no difference . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( )c Here again, the teacher will find it a rather easy matter to give some reasons for each of the alternatives. The teacher will work out the problem herself and would probably check as the right answer-"a. The bottle wrapped with the wet towel would stay sweet longer than the other bottle." She might give as her reasons for that judgment: I. Evaporation is accompanied by an absorption of heat. 2. Bacteria do not grow so rapidly when temperatures are kept low. 3 See pages 95-98 for interpretation of results. 4 In the most reasonable solution of this problem, the teacher realized that a principle involving evaporation was necessary in the explanation, but her class had already been taught that evaporation is accompanied by an absorption of heat.</page><page sequence="7">APRIL 13, 1938 91 3. The souring of milk is the result of the growth and life processes of bacteria. The teacher might now proceed toward making some reasons for conclusion c: 4. A wet towel could not interfere with the growth of bacteria in the milk. 5. Wrapping the bottle with a wet towel is merely an old super- stition. In writing up some reasons for conclusion b, she might write: 6. The water in the towel absorbs heat and makes the milk stay warm longer. 7. Wrapping a bottle of milk makes it warmer in the same way that people put on extra wraps to keep warm. With all these reasons developed, the next step is to rearrange them in a scrambled order, and the test items which follow the description of the situation would be as follows: The bottle wrapped with the wet towel would stay sweet: a. longer than without the wet towel . . . . . . ( x ) a5 b. not as long as without the wet towel . . . . . ( )b c. the same length of time-the wet towel would make no difference .. ........... ( )c Choose the statements which you would use to explain or support your conclusion: d. The souring of milk is the result of the growth and life processes of bacteria .......... ( x )d e. A wet towel could not interfere with the growth of bac- teria in the milk............ ( )e f. The water in the towel absorbs heat and makes the milk stay warm longer .........)f g. Wrapping the bottle with a wet towel is merely an old superstition... ...........( )g h. Evaporation is accompanied by an absorption of heat . ( x )h i. Bacteria do not grow so rapidly when temperatures are kept low ............. (x)i j. Wrapping a bottle of milk makes it warmer in the same way that people put on extra wraps to keep warm . ( )j AN OUTLINE has been presented for the making of test exer- cises in which the student has the opportunity to indicate which of several reasons presented are consistent with the choice which he made among the conclusions. Some teachers have ' The letter x indicates the scoring key developed by the teachers.</page><page sequence="8">92 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN varied the procedure by including among the reasons many fallacious reasons like those which students often give in sup- port of their decisions in school. The correct application of scientific facts, definitions, or principles to a new situation is probably not a simple, unitary ability, but a complex of mental habits, attitudes, understandings, skills, and inhibitions which brings into play almost all the elements of "scientific method." As an appraisal of scientific thinking, therefore, a test of the application of principles to new situations may well include among its incorrect responses some characteristic violations of the spirit and method of scientific inquiry. In defending a decision to which they have come, some stu- dents, instead of giving good reasons, merely assume what they are trying to prove. Let us assume that a student has checked the right conclusion, and that we want to discover whether or not he will give substantial reasons for his conclusion or whether he will jump to some statement which merely assumes what he has already decided to be the answer. We might well add a statement which is in effect a repetition of the true answer and which might begin with any of the following phrases: everyone knows, experience proves, it is generally agreed, everyday liv- ing shows, it is naturally followed, it is ridiculous or absurd to believe anything different, it is only common sense to say that. Sometimes in support of their decisions, students will offer analogy as evidence. Not infrequently, analogies are useful as illustrations, but quite often they are used where the analogies do not apply exactly and when they do not serve as evidence for proof at all. Teachers who want to make use of this form of reasoning error in developing statements might begin the statements with such phrases as the following: just as, accord- ingly, since, like, even as, much the same as, in like fashion, similar to, corresponding to, from the fact that . . . we may conclude, bearing in mind that, and remembering that. Stu- dents often use the irrelevant answer. Teachers will not find it difficult at all to supply a number of statements which are slightly irrelevant to the correct answer. Quite frequently there are false statements included in the essays which students write when they defend a particular answer that they have written out. It is not difficult for teachers to devise statements which are made up of false evidence of the kinds commonly supplied by students.</page><page sequence="9">APRIL 13, 1938 93 In some situations there are common misconceptions which apply. Some teachers are more skillful than others in their discovery of these most common misconceptions; but it must be remembered that they do not apply in every situation, and should be used only where they have application. Misconcep- tions may be described by saying that they are ideas commonly held which are not supported by evidence. Teachers who want to extend their knowledge of the common misconceptions in science may depend upon contact with people who have not had high-school or college training, may get some of it from the literature which they read, but will have to depend largely upon knowing the kinds of misconceptions and errors which students make. A sixth kind of error which students make in justifying their conclusions is that of relying upon false or spurious authority. Teachers who are anxious to get at the information of their stu- dents who make this error may well develop statements which begin with: advertisements in the best magazines say; science says; various famous people say; certain books say; in a maga- zine article it said; well-known industrial leaders say; research organizations say; father, mother, teacher said; and over the radio, a speaker said. Sometimes the situation is one dealing with living things other than man-or sometimes with inanimate nature-and we are able to see whether or not students select teleological or anthropomorphic statements. These might be written so that they will have the following phrases in them: animals do certain things-in order to; so that; for the purpose of; for (in the sense of desire); to (in the sense of desire); because of need, desires, wants, wishes, likes, fears; divinity, inscrutable purpose (mystical); because nature wants. Sometimes students try to defend a particular point which they have taken by ridiculing an opposing viewpoint. By de- veloping lists of such statements in connection with a particular situation, teachers may find out who of their students are most likely to fall into this kind of error. It is possible to write some statements which would say, in effect, that any other conclusion but the correct one is sheer nonsense; that it is absurd to believe anything else; that only untrained students would choose an- other; that every sensible person would choose this one. If these various types of statements are made and are appro-</page><page sequence="10">94 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN priate to the situation for which they are made, the teacher may be able to get various kinds of evidence from the answers which the students have given.' One exercise constructed according to these procedures follows: What would happen to the weight of a piece of meat if it were placed uncovered in an electric refrigerator? Directions: Choose the conclusion which you believe is most consistent with the facts given and most reasonable in the light of your knowledge. Conclusions : - A. It will gain weight. x B. It will lose weight. -C. It will remain at the same weight. Directions: From the following list, choose the reasons you would use to explain or support your conclusion. Reasons: i. Water vapor is given off by the meat at any temperature. (Correct reason) 2. The temperature in the electric refrigerator is lower than room temperature. (Irrelevant reason) - 3 It is foolish to believe that food, when placed in a refrigerator which is almost airtight, would lose weight. (Ridicule) 4- Just as a block of ice weighs less than an identical volume of water, so will meat weigh less after it is placed uncovered in an electric refrigerator. (False analogy) - 5. The expansion coil is the coldest part of an electric refriger- ator. (Correct reason) -6. Manufacturers of electric refrigerators claim that food when properly stored in their refrigerators will neither lose nor gain weight. (False authority) - 7. The increased weight is caused by evaporation. (Technically false) - 8. Water vapor tends to condense on the coldest part of the re- frigerator. (Correct reason) Reasons inconsistent with various conclusions were: with A, I, 4, 5, 6, 8; with B, 3, 6, 7; with C, I, 4, 5, 7, 8. T HE student who makes errors in the test exercises some- times does so because of his inability to apply facts, prin- ciples, and definitions to new situations. Sometimes the student does not have the necessary information; in other words, he 6 Quite obviously, there are many other types of errors in reasoning which teachers may want to include in the tests which they make. These are offered only as illustrations of a few of the commonest types. " The letter x indicates the scoring key developed by the teachers.</page><page sequence="11">APRIL I3, 1938 95 may not know the facts, principles, and definitions which apply. If a teacher feels that some of her students may not have the necessary information, it may be wise to give to the class a list of facts, principles, and definitions which have been taught and to include with them a list of facts, principles, and definitions which are not true and ask the students to check those which they know to be true. The use of an information test may eliminate this possibility of misinterpreting the test results. Generally the teacher wants this ability described in three ways. She wants to know with what facility the student can select a conclusion or make a prediction which is most consistent with the facts given. The student reveals this ability when he is presented with problem situations and asked to predict what will happen or to explain what did happen under certain cir- cumstances. The teacher wants to know with what facility the student can present reasons which support or explain his conclu- sions. This information gives the teacher some knowledge of the comprehensiveness of the student's reasoning; it is revealed by the number of sound reasons chosen by a student to support or explain his conclusions. In this same connection, a teacher wants to know what percentage of the student's reasons are correct. This is easily determined by counting the total number of reasons and then tabulating the number of those correct. Finally, the teacher wants to know the types of errors in thinking which are made by a student, so that a plan for remed- ial instruction may be set up. If these "thinking errors" have been part of the design in the construction of the tests, it be- comes a relatively simple matter to report the frequency of the different types of errors for each student. SOME illustrative descriptions of the test results of different students are given in Table I. The scores made by eleven students are grouped here for convenience of reference. The reader will note that the first three students made accurate predictions in every test exercise in the examination. At the same time, however, note how different the scores are when an analysis is made of their reasons. John Gregg chose 80o per cent of the available correct reasons to support his conclusions; among his incorrect reasons he was more prone to assume the conclusions and to use false analogies as reasons. In a few cases, he chose reasons which actually supported conclusions</page><page sequence="12">96 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN different from those of his own selection. Contrast his record with that of Mary Pickering. All of her predictions were cor- rect, and yet she chose only 46 per cent of the available correct reasons to support her conclusions. Her errors were concen- trated in assuming what she was trying to prove; she made more errors of this type than any one in the group of forty-five stu- dents. She also relied frequently upon false authorities and upon false analogies and chose many true but irrelevant reasons. Notwithstanding these frequent errors, she showed no incon- TABLE I PERCENTAGES OF DESIRABLE AND UNDESIRABLE RESPONSES APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES IN SCIENCE Name Desirable Undesirable A B C D E F G H I (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (io) Gregg, John......... 10oo 80 16 o 30 30 0 13 8 Pickering, Mary......

Her reasons, no matter how specious, always tended to support the conclusions which she selected. The case of Edward Haskett is still different. He, too, has a perfect score in making predictions and, like Mary, he has only 46 per cent of the correct reasons to support his conclusions. This boy, however, is consistent in his reasoning and makes few errors. It is evident that his relatively low score in Column 3 (correct reasons) is attributable to the fact that he did not choose many. This may be due to caution, to a lack of knowl- edge, or to an inability to see that the principles applied.</page><page sequence="13">APRIL I3, 1938 97 The next group of students had high scores in choosing conclusions which were most consistent with the facts given. Note again, however, how the patterns of achievement differ with respect to all columns but the first. Irving Drexel's achievement includes none of the types of errors which were tabulated. David Conaway has made many errors, and these are distributed over many different types. Edward Davis and Ruth Bigler are distinguished from the other two in Column 3, which represents the percentage of correct reasons chosen to support their conclusions. These two students differ from each other when the remaining columns are studied. The four students in the lowest group show similar wide variations with respect to type of achievement. Notice that Bernadine Beatty has only 50 per cent of the correct conclusions and yet has chosen 70 per cent of the available correct reasons. In this latter respect, she stands second highest in the class; but note the many errors and the many types of errors represented in her reasoning. Compare her scores with those of Horace Slyh who has almost as many correct predictions to his credit, many fewer correct reasons, and practically no errors in reason- ing. It is interesting to note, too, that these four students have higher scores in Column 4 than do the others. They evidently have chosen a number of technically false reasons to support their conclusions. This points to a lack of knowledge of the correct principles and where the scores in Column 3 are low, points also to a lack of ability in applying principles. O VER a period of several years, studies were made of the relations between the results of a test of application of principles and the results of a test of the interpretation of data.8 Sixteen separate studies were reported; the number of students in each investigation varied from 22 to 684. The correlation coefficients, corrected for attenuation, ranged from .33 to .54. These findings are substantial justification of the judgment that we must appraise each of these abilities separately; achievement in one is not always accompanied by achievement in the other. The relationship between scores on a test of the application of principles and scores made on an information test was found to be similar to those between the results of a test of application 8 Judd, Charles H. Education as Cultivation of the Higher Mental Processes. New York: Macmillan Company, 1936. pp. 12-17. The coefficients reported with one excep- tion were gathered in studies made by the Tests Division, Bureau of Educational Research, Ohio State University.</page><page sequence="14">98 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN of principles and a test of interpretation of data. Sixteen studies were reported with coefficients of correlation ranging from .31 to .58. One would naturally expect a somewhat higher rela- tionship here because the ability to apply principles is dependent upon knowledge of them. Frutchey reported the largest percentage of retention was found in the ability to apply principles; in his study the other variables measured included the selection of facts, terminology, symbols, formulas, valence, and balancing equations. He states that his study substantiates other studies of retention of achieve- ment involving objectives other than information and adds that retention was greatest in the more general types of behavior.9 Tyler reports that during a fifteen-month period, there was no loss in the ability of students to apply important zoalogical principles to new situations or to interpret data obtained from experiments.1o Measuring the Interpretation of Data WHEN teachers talk about "the interpretation of data," they usually think that the word data means evidence or "facts" presented in running comments, or in tables, graphs, maps, cartoons, pictures, or other materials of a pub- lished sort. They also include nonpublished materials such as facts presented in motion pictures or in radio broadcasts, as well as actual firsthand experiences, both in and out of school. These data are usually thought of as referring to areas which are related to the curriculum of the school. The compila- tion of lists of areas has been common. A list arranged by teachers in Greeley, Colorado, contains 28 major types of problems. The "Science Report of the Progressive Education Association" also contains many. Mr. O. I. Frederick, of Mis- sissippi, reports a collation of many such lists, and it contains 9 large problem areas. The following list of such major areas has been selected from certain unpublished reports to which the writer has access: housingi crime; recreation; racial relations; nationalism, imperialism, and war; labor organization and labor</page><page sequence="15">APRIL 13, 1938 99 relations; family problems; religion; intelligent consumption; taxation; money and credit; and transportation and communi- cation. Teachers frequently in their discussions of the "interpreta- tion of data" give it three meanings. The first is, interpretation may be a summary of the data. This summary may represent the description of a trend in the materials; and in some cases this trend will be shown by part of the data which may be con- trasted with the remaining portion of the data. Or again, sig- nificant points within the data which may be extremes or which may represent peculiar deviations from the general trend may be distinguished; or the data may be manipulated in such a fash- ion that one or more inferences can be drawn which are not readily apparent in the facts as they are presented. In all of these cases, of course, the interpretation is always one which is supported by the presented facts; it is not qualified as "probably true." In all its varieties, this meaning of interpretation em- braces both the making of inferences and actual reading or re-reading of the facts given. A second common meaning of interpretation is associated with a less prosaic activity and is focused upon making qualified inferences from the facts given. In general, this type of inter- pretation can be accomplished successfully only where trends are revealed in the data and the inferences involved consist of prudent extrapolation or interpolation of the data. A student who does this type of interpreting well employs his imagination in predicting conclusions which are somewhat beyond the facts but which are in agreement with a definitely established trend. In making this type of interpretation, the student always quali- fies it with the phrase "probably true." Even where this type of inference is qualified, the student is careful not to go far beyond the observed facts and limits his predictions to rather narrow ranges. What has been said about extrapolation, or going be- yond the facts intelligently, is also true of interpolation, that is, going between the observed data and risking an inference concerning an omitted point in a set of data which reveals an established trend. Conversely, students who do well in this type of interpreting are quite apt to designate as "probably false" an observation or inference which contradicts an estab- lished trend. The third most common meaning attached to the word</page><page sequence="16">I00 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN interpretation is related to the recognition of the limitations of data. In the preceding paragraph, the emphasis was upon squeezing out of the facts not only that which was indisputably true but additional inferences which could be designated as "probably true." Implied in that purpose was the aim to get as much out of the data as possible. That concept is to be contrasted with the present third meaning of the word interpre- tation. In recognizing the limitations of data, the student who interprets well will see that many interpretations must be re- garded as almost completely uncertain because the facts are insufficient to support these interpretations even qualifiedly. Teachers who strive to develop in their pupils the abil- ity to interpret data emphasize in their teaching all three of these aspects. Students are guided to make unqualified inter- pretations which are rather fully supported by the available evidence. Students are shown how to make interpretations which are somewhat beyond the facts and which may yet be thought to be in the realm of probable truth. They are also shown how to recognize the limitations of the available evidence and to recognize that certain types of interpretations may not even be thought of as qualifiedly supported; teachers suggest to students that the last type may be taken as a hypothesis and other data sought which may have relevance to the point. The data presented to students most frequently are new in the sense that this particular organization of the facts has not been discussed previously. Interpretation is thought of as a developing ability. Experimental evidence shows that this ability does not transfer perfectly from one area to another. T HE following outlined procedure is suggested for the actual construction of a test to appraise the student's ability to interpret data.' It has been followed by many teachers with successful results, and it may be modified to suit individual and local needs. It is offered only as a guide and should be varied to meet the purposes of teachers. I. Choose some data which students are to interpret. 2. Make a series of interpretations from these data, patterned after the three major categories mentioned here. These will take the form of 1 Obviously, it would be good practice to have data collected by students in their attack on the solution of problems which are vital to them. Where this is not the pro- cedure, it would certainly be wise to have data chosen which have significance in the lives of the students.</page><page sequence="17">APRIL 13, 1938 101 a. Statements which are rather fully supported by the data. b. Others which may be thought of as only "probably true" and which are partially supported by the data. c. Statements which represent interpretations which are not supported by the data and which must be classified as "uncertain" because they are based upon insufficient evidence. d. Statements which contradict some established trends within the data and may therefore be classified as "probably false." e. Statements which are actually contradicted by the evidence and may therefore be labeled as "false." Let us follow through this procedure with an example. Let us suppose that the data chosen for the test devoted to the interpretation of data comprised percentages regarding the per- sons gainfully employed in the United States taken from the book, Recent Social Trends. We shall follow the outline and make statements which are true, some which are probably true, some which are based on insufficient evidence, some which are probably false, and some which are false. Then we shall pre- pare the materials for the students and check the directions. In arranging the items in the test, we shall not put them in logical order. Here are the statements as they are presented in the test preceded by the data to be interpreted: PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF GAINFULLY OCCUPIED PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND OVER, 1870-1930 Occupation Group 11870 1188o 189o 1900oo 1910o 192o 1930 (I) (2) (3) (4) 1(5) (6) (7) (8) Agriculture ................... . 52.8 48.1 41.2 35-9 30.3 25.8 21.3 M ining ...................... 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.1 2.6 2.7 2.0 Manufacturing ................ 22.0 24.8 26.3 27.5 28.6 30.5 28.6 Trade and transportation ......... 9.1 I0.7 I3.6 16.3 17.4 18.o 20.7 Clerical service................. 1.7 2.0 2.5 2.8 4.6 7.2 8.2 Domestic and personal service..... 9.6 8.8 9.7 1o.o io.6 8.8 11.3 Public service .................. .6 .7 .9 1.0o 1.1 1.6 i .4 Professional service ........... . . 2.7 3.3 4.0 4-4 4.8 5.4 6.5 Total ......................

FOR the purpose of this article, let us assume that we have made ten or twelve such exercises, all of them relating to data which teachers believe are important. Moreover, let us assume that the suggested interpretations have been made ac- cording to the five types described and that if we counted the different interpretations the statements would take approxi- mately the following distribution: Per Cent True ..................................... Io Probably true............................... 20 Uncertain ................................. 40 Probably false .............................. 20 False .............................. ........ Io Let us assume further that in a complete test approximately one hundred such interpretations have been presented to stu- dents, that they have taken the test, and that we have scored</page><page sequence="19">APRIL 13, 1938 103 the papers. How can we describe students' achievement which will meet the needs of teachers? We might set up a chart and tabulate all of the students' responses in the manner given in Table I. This is easily done because we have the student's paper before us, and we have a key which has been worked out with the teacher. By glancing at the chart, we can tell immediately how many of the true statements the student recognized accu- rately. This will be in the little square labeled a. If we count all of the tally marks in the little squares labeled a, g, m, s, and y, we shall have the total number of statements which a student recognized accurately. When we remember that there were TABLE I SUMMARY SHEET-ASPECTS OF THINKING* This student marked these statements as: Number of statements in Prob- Insuffi- Prob- this test which SHOULD True ably cient ably False Omit- have been marked as: True Data Falseted (I) (2) (3) (4) (5) True were Io (I) a b c d e Probably true were 2o (2) f g h i / Insufficient data were 40 (3) k 1 m n o Probably false were 20 (4) p q r s t False were Io (5) u v w. x y * This test can be modified so that it can be used for machine scoring. Directions have been worked out which make it possible to use the new scoring machine, and it is possible now to score approximately Ioo papers of this kind an hour and to record seven different results which are a part of this single test. Total Omitted i00 statements in the entire test, we see immediately that the total number which the student had correct represents the per- centage of all the possible correct responses which were pre- sented in this test. If we want to know how well the student recognized those "probably true" or "probably false," we can refer to the little squares marked g and s. If we add these two amounts together and divide by 40 (there were 40 such statements altogether in the test), we shall then know the percentage of the qualified interpretations which the student had correct. If we want to know how well the student was able to recog- nize the limitations of the data presented, we can focus our attention upon the little square labeled m. There were 40 such statements in the test, and we have only to divide the number</page><page sequence="20">104 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN which he recognized correctly by 40 to get the percentage of correct responses in this category. If the teacher, by a study of this chart, would like to know how frequently a student went beyond the facts, she might turn her attention to all of the squares included in f, k, 1, n, o, and t. We see that these represent behavior on the part of the student in which he took statements that were probably true and called them true, or took statements that should have been designated as probably false and called them false, or he took statements which really were based on insufficient evidence and called them probably true or true-or designated them as probably false or false. All in all, there were 80 opportunities for the student to do this, and here again it would be an easy matter to calculate the percentage of the times a student went beyond the facts. If the teacher is interested in knowing the tendency or the disposition of a student to go beyond the facts in the direction of ascribing more truth to the data than is warranted, she can direct her studies toward the squares labeled f, k, and 1; the tallies recorded in these spaces all point to a student's tendency to ascribe more truth to statements than is warranted. If the teacher is interested in knowing the tendency of a student to reject a statement as "more false" than the facts would warrant, she might focus her attention upon the squares labeled n, o, and t. Here again, the same 60 statements must be counted as opportunities, and, as in the other cases, it is an easy matter to determine a percentage score. To get some measure of the cruder errors in judgments which students are likely to make, a teacher needs only to study the spaces labeled d, e, i, and j, and those labeled p, q, u, and v. Tally marks in these spaces indicate that a student is confusing truth and falsity. Table II reports the scores made by four students of a twelfth-grade class in a test of this sort.2 The first student in the list, Ross Sunny, represents the highest achievement in almost all aspects of the test. In Column 2, we notice that his general accuracy in interpreting statements is represented by a score of 72 per cent, and this is the highest score in the group. We note that he had 60 per cent of the probably true and prob- ably false interpretations correct-again the highest score in 2 More information concerning the achievement of a great majority of students in the Lakeshore School on this particular test is recorded in the EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN, for March, 1938, on page 62.</page><page sequence="21">APRIL 13, 1938 105 the group. He seems to be able to recognize the limitations of the data (see Column 4) for he has recognized 77 per cent of the opportunities wherein data are insufficient to make judg- ments. In the negative characteristics revealed by the test, his scores are low. He went beyond the facts only 19 per cent of the time. In ascribing greater truth or greater falsity to the data than was warranted (see Columns 6 and 7), his scores were low, and he made almost no crude errors in judgment, which include confusing true statements with false ones or "probably true" statements with those which are "probably false."

The scores of the second student, Leon Hyle, are some- what less consistent. In general accuracy in interpreting mate- rials, he stands at about the median of the class. This is true also of the ability shown in Column 3, which represents his accuracy in recognizing statements that are probably true and probably false. In Column 4, however, we note how strong he is in recognizing the limitations of the data, in grasping the fact that the evidence is insufficient to make a judgment. On the negative side of the table we note that he went beyond the facts</page><page sequence="22">io6 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN (Column 5) much less than was typical of the group, and yet we note that he made many more crude errors in judgment than was typical of his group (see Column 6). Leon would evi- dently profit much from guidance with respect to this ability, and it could most profitably be directed toward Column 3 and Column 8. Priscilla Diederly, the third student in the list, shows quite a different pattern of achievement. Here we have a student who recognizes half of the statements which were in the test and judges them at their proper worth. She seems to do rather well in handling the qualified interpretations and has a rather high percentage of those correct compared to the median of the group (Column 3). When we look at the results of her achievement in Column 4, however, we note at once that she has the lowest score in the group with respect to recognizing the limitations of the available facts. When this is compared with her score in Column 5, going beyond the data, we note that here, more than anyone else in her group, she tended to make judgments without due regard to the evidence. She is lowest with respect to recognizing the limitations of the data and high- est with respect to going beyond the facts. She was frequently "gullible" in that 38 per cent of her responses ascribed greater truth to the interpretations than the facts would warrant. Not- withstanding this performance of Priscilla's, we note that only Io per cent of the time did she make crude errors in judgment, ranking only second to Ross Sunny in this respect. The teacher could profitably direct Priscilla's efforts toward studying data more carefully in the hope that she would come to recognize their real worth. If we turn to Helen Taber, we see a still different pattern of responses. In general accuracy, she has the lowest score in her group. In her ability to handle statements which must be qualified as probably true or probably false, she is again almost at the bottom of the class. When it comes to recognizing the limitations of the data, however, Helen shows almost average ability. In Column 5 we get some estimate of her tendency to go beyond the data, and we see again that her score represents about the median of the group. This is also true of her score in Column 6, which is associated with her disposition to ascribe greater truth to the interpretations than the facts would war- rant. In Column 7, however, we see again a departure from the</page><page sequence="23">APRIL 13, 1938 107 group pattern. Here Helen has shown the highest disposition of any in her group to .reject as "more false" than the facts would warrant, many statements which should have been marked either as uncertain or as probably true. In Column 8, we note that there are many crude errors in judgment. In fact, she has made more of them than any other person in the group of which she is a member. In nearly all aspects of the abilities represented in this test, Helen's achievement is low and teach- ing guidance would probably best take the form of general aid in every area.3 The student's responses were compared to the median of the group and to the range of scores because the writer believes that the first use which should be made of students' achieve- ment on a test of this sort involves comparing accomplishment of the present date with that of a previous time so that some estimate of growth may be made. With respect to the present test, however, these students had not taken it before. OBVIOUSLY, there is no single way to make a test of inter- pretation of data. It should meet the purposes of the teacher, and any suggested form should be modified in order that those purposes can be met. The test described in this article has been modified in a number of ways to meet the needs of different teachers. Some teachers have insisted that after a student has made a decision about an interpretation, he should be required to give the reasons which support his judgment. Other teachers believe that the fivefold discrimination is alto- gether too fine to expect of students in the high school, and they have developed tests of their own which require the stu- dents to make only three distinctions: to recognize statements which are supported by the data, to recognize statements which are contradicted by the data, and to recognize statements which are neither supported nor contradicted. Undoubtedly, there are many other modifications which have been made and still many others which will be made in the future, depending upon the purposes of the teacher. 3 Before deciding upon what to do, the teacher would surely consult other sources of evidence. The teacher would want to know the results from other tests. When she has all of the significant information assembled, she will be in a better position to suggest next steps to Helen.</page><page sequence="24">Evaluating Some Aspects of Proof M ATHEMATICS teachers have been contending for many years that an important objective of their teaching is the development in their students of what is loosely called "thinking." Much has been written by teachers about their efforts to promote growth in thinking in mathematics courses. A significant contribution in this field has been made by Harold P. Fawcett, a teacher of mathematics in the upper division at the Ohio State University High School. In 1936 he wrote a paper which described in summary form the major ob- jectives of his teaching efforts and some examples illustrating the content and procedure of his teaching. This bulletin was distributed by the Progressive Education Association, and efforts to reconstruct the mathematics courses were intensified in many places. He tried to get his pupils to understand the place of defini- tions and assumptions in any discussion and the relation between the conclusions reached in any area of thought and the defini- tions and assumptions on which those conclusions might depend. When this general objective was restated in terms of student behavior, the following characteristics were considered of great importance: students who are growing in this understanding will select the significant words and phrases in any statement which is important to them and ask that they be carefully de- fined; they will require evidence in support of any conclusion that they are pressed to accept; they will analyze that evidence and distinguish fact from assumption; they will recognize both the stated and unstated assumptions essential to any conclusion; they will evaluate the underlying assumptions, accepting some and rejecting others, depending upon the circumstances; they will evaluate the argument, accepting or rejecting or doubting the conclusion; they will constantly re-examine the assumptions which are behind their beliefs and which guide their actions. Some evidence of a pupil's understanding of the nature of proof can be gathered by utilizing techniques already described in this issue-the interpretation of data and the application of principles. A student who continually goes beyond the data may not be alert to the evidence which is required to support a conclusion. We can get some measure of the ability of stu- dents to select significant words and phrases which need defi- 0o8</page><page sequence="25">APRIL 13, 1938 Iog nition by utilizing the techniques described for testing the ability to apply principles. We need only to find situations in which words and phrases need definition, present them to stu- dents, ask for a judgment, and suggest that these should be supported with reasons. For example, we might present to students situations like the following: In many cities there are two forms of street transportation in com- mon use. One of these is the usual streetcar, which runs on a rigid track and operates by electric power from an overhead trolley. The other is the bus or motor coach which runs on rubber tires, is free to move about in the street, and is powered by a gasoline engine. Recently, at Columbus, Ohio, the transportation company put in service a new type of vehicle to haul passengers. The new vehicle has rubber tires, and can move about in the street, but is operated by electric power from an overhead trolley. An argument arose between the transportation company and the city. Street cars are allowed by the laws of the city to make left turns at certain corners. Busses are not allowed to make the left turns. It was to the advantage of the car company to have their new vehicles make these left turns, but some members of the city council said it would not be legal. Assume the statements above to be true. Conclusions- -A. By the laws of the city, the new vehicle should not be allowed to make left turns. -B. By the laws of the city, the new vehicle should be allowed to make left turns. xC. This cannot be settled without further information. The list of reasons has been omitted because of lack of space. If the suggestions for constructing the test for application of principles are followed, teachers will have little difficulty in developing a list of reasons for this or similar problems. We might construct some exercises which get at the ability of students to recognize unstated assumptions and to evaluate them by using this same technique but other types of problems. For example: Mary had been making a study of different forms of government. She prepared a report which she gave before her social-studies class. In conclusion she said: "There are three types of government in power to- day: Communist, Fascist, and Democratic. The government of Russia is Communistic. The governments of Italy and Germany are controlled 1 Another of these problems was given in its entirety on page 66 of the EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN for March I6, I938. 2 See pages 89-94.</page><page sequence="26">I IO EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN by Fascists. The governments of England and the United States are democratic. I have given facts to show that the governments of Russia, Italy, and Germany are really unsatisfactory for the common people. If you accept these facts and this conclusion, then it follows that the democratic form of government is the only satisfactory form for the common people." Now let us assume that the facts Mary has presented concerning the three types of government in power today are accurate. Let us also assume that these facts actually do show that the governments of Russia, Italy, and Germany are really unsatisfactory for the common people. Conclusions- -A. Mary proved that a democratic government is the only satisfactory kind for the common people. -B. Mary did not prove that a democratic government is the only satis- factory kind for the common people. Here we have an illustration of the so-called "indirect argu- ment." Mary has discussed three types of government and even if the facts about Communism and Fascism are accepted, the conclusion that the democratic form of government is the only satisfactory one for the common people does not follow. Iv WE want to appraise a student's facility in drawing fact from assumption, his insight in recognizing which as- sumptions are of critical importance in the discussion, his ability to organize a proof, and his ability to defend his own beliefs, we might do better by attacking the problem indirectly. Let us present a problem situation to students in which a conclusion has been reached. Let us add a section which will include state- ments pertaining to the problem. In this list of statements we shall include all of the necessary facts and assumptions which lead up to the conclusion, we shall include also some irrelevant data and some statements which are inconsistent or contradictory to the conclusion. We shall follow this procedure by asking the student to read the problem, to study carefully each of the state- ments, and to mark all those which are facts F and all those which are assumptions A. In Part II, we shall ask the student to indicate the assumptions which are most critical if the conclu- sion is to be accepted. In Part III, we shall ask the student to select from the list of statements all those which prove the con- clusion. The following is an example of the procedure: Step I. Describe a problem situation in which a conclusion has been made. Step 2. Restate the facts contained in the problem description.</page><page sequence="27">APRIL 13, 1938 III Step 3. In almost every situation where a conclusion has been drawn, there is some gap between the facts presented and the conclusion. In other words, some of the assumptions involved in accepting that conclu- sion have not been stated explicitly. These "gaps" or implicit assumptions must next be stated. The reader is cautioned to include all those neces- sary if the conclusion is to be accepted. Step 4. Restate the conclusion. Step 5. Introduce some irrelevant statements which unthinking students might designate as relevant. Step 6. Introduce some statements which are inconsistent with or contra- dictory to the conclusion. Step 7. Rearrange these statements and present both the list of statements and the problem to the students. The test here is devised by following these directions: John and Paul got on a teeter-totter, and sometime later Paul noticed that the board would remain perfectly balanced when their feet were not touching the ground. "Look John," he said, "we must be exactly the same weight." List of Statements- - I. John may have been sitting a little farther from the center or a little nearer than Paul. - 2. If two boys on a teeter-totter weigh the same, then the teeter- totter wvill balance. - 3. The board probably was not balanced before the boys got on it. - 4. John and Paul got on a teeter-totter. - 5. The boys were of about the same height. - 6. No matter how the boys sat, it would influence the balancing of the board and make it impossible for anyone to say that they were exactly the same weight. - 7. The teeter-totter balanced perfectly when their feet were not touching the ground. - 8. The board was twelve feet long. - 9. The teeter-totter balanced when the boys were not on it. -i o. Paul said: "Look John, we must be exactly the same weight." -i 1. Both boys were the same distance from the place at which the teeter-totter was balanced. -12. John's clothes weighed just as much as Paul's clothes. -I 3. The way the boys leaned while sitting on the teeter-totter did not influence the balancing of the board. -14. John and Paul were exactly the same weight. Direction No. i: After reading the problem carefully, study each state- ment in the list. Suppose, for the moment, that you personally had been present in that situation. Under those circumstances, you would have accepted some of the following statements as matters of fact. Some of</page><page sequence="28">I 12 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN them, however, you would have regarded as assumptions. By assumption we mean a statement that is open to doubt, that may or may not be true, and which, in this particular situation, you would not accept as a fact. Place the letter A in front of these statements. Direction No. 2: Which of these statements in the list would you accept as facts? Write the letter F in front of those statements. Direction No. 3: If you were trying to prove that these boys were of the same weight, you would make use of the available facts, but it would also be necessary for you to make use of some assumptions. In this par- ticular problem, select three assumptions which are very important in the logical proof that the boys were of the same weight. Direction No. 4: When arguments for or against some proposition are presented in newspapers, magazines, speeches, or textbooks, we often feel that the discussion could have been made more logical. Statements are sometimes put in which are really unnecessary to prove the point; at other times, important arguments are omitted; on still other occasions, statements are included which actually contradict the conclusion. Sup- pose that you were describing this situation and you were trying to prove that the boys weighed the same. Which statements would you use in your proof? Include only those which you think are necessary, but be sure to include all of those needed to prove the conclusion. THE first student in Table I,3 Charles Faye, has recognized 13 correct facts and 17 correct assumptions and is about the median of the group in this ability. In this test, he selects all six (the maximum) of the critical assumptions upon which the con- clusions depended. In organizing his proof, he includes i i rele- vant facts, all six of the critically important assumptions, all three of the conclusions, and did not introduce any irrelevant or inconsistent arguments. His performance is consistently good and reveals significant accomplishment in the objective. We notice that Ralph Bestor does unusually well in dis- tinguishing facts and assumptions (see Columns 2 and 3) and less well in recognizing critically important assumptions. In organizing his proof, he has included few facts, has introduced only three of the six important assumptions, and has included the conclusion in only one of the three problems which were in the test, besides bringing in two irrelevant arguments. Elizabeth Moore is among the highest in the group in distinguishing facts and assumptions. In recognizing those assumptions which were most important if the conclusions were 3 More complete results for the entire school in the achievement of this objective are recorded in the EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN, for March 16, 1938, on page 71.</page><page sequence="29">APRIL 13, 1938 II3 to be accepted, however, she has done much less well (see Col- umn 4), and in organizing her proof, she shows many defi- ciencies. She has chosen only six of the relevant facts, has included only one of the six important assumptions, and does not include any of the conclusions. Moreover, she has intro- duced five irrelevant facts into her argument and an additional statement which was inconsistent with or contradictory to one of her conclusions. Edgar Cram seems able to recognize statements which are facts much better than he can distinguish those which are assumptions. He is typical of the group in recognizing which TABLE I STUDENTS' SCORES ON A TEST DEALING WITH THE NATURE OF PROOF Differentiating Organizing of Proof Name between Statements Organizing of Proof A I B C D E F G H (I) I.

In organizing his proof, Edgar shows almost no discrimination. We note that he has thirteen of the relevant facts, all six of the important critical assumptions, and all three of the conclusions. This looks like an unusually fine record until we note his scores in Columns 8 and 9 and see that he has included eight irrelevant statements in his argument and four which are definitely inconsistent with or contradictory to his conclusions. Perhaps the description of the achievement of these four students is sufficient to indicate the wide variations in accom- plishment of the objective. The scores seem to point definitely</page><page sequence="30">I 14 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN to promising remedial procedures. Where students in general are unable to discriminate between facts and assumptions, prob- lem situations may be introduced and discussions promoted to- ward developing the ability. In Mr. Fawcett's discussion of the nature of proof, he describes the following exercise: Underlying the beliefs of an individual are numerous assumptions, and anyone who accepts a conclusion regarding any issue at the same time accepts the assumptions on which that conclusion depends, even though he may not know what some of them really are. For this reason it is well that we often examine the assumptions behind our beliefs so that we may be fully conscious of just what our position on any important issue involves. Will you then state your present position on the following topics and in the space provided for analysis, list the statements on which in your opinion this positions depends? By checking in the proper column indicate which of these statements you consider to be facts and those which you regard as assumptions. It will also be well to define any words or phrases which will clarify your position: I. Awards- Some pupils in the school feel that there should be a set of fixed criteria for honors and awards, and once a student has satisfied these criteria, he should be granted an award. Others feel that the problem of awards is more complex, and that any set of fixed criteria cannot possibly take into account all factors in a given situation. My present position on this problem is: Analysis of my position Statement umption of Fact Assumption While we have considerable evidence as to the way this kind of work is affecting the thinking of the pupils in other areas, perhaps the most interesting is the reaction which comes from the social science area where the pupils are insisting on the use of clearly defined terms and raising questions as to what are the assumptions behind some of the social theories discussed. Evidence that they are using this kind of thinking in their out of school experiences is found in the many voluntary contribu- tions which have been submitted for consideration. These cover a wide range of topics such as advertisements, political propaganda, addresses by prominent people, sales arguments, editorials, magazine articles, discus- sions from Sunday School classes, ministers' sermons and the like.
