<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susanna Lindberg Hans Jonas' theory of Life in the face of Responsibility Abstract What is the concept of life that, according to Hans Jonas, can and must constitute an object of political responsibility? It is neither mechanist nor purely phenomenological, but rather has a spéculative aspect. It is presented through the questions of being, self and teleology: life is a singular's act of constant création of itself as a world-relation. Why does Jonas desire the pro tection of the „image of man"? This makes sense if „image" is understood not as a given fig ure, but rather as man's capacity of freedom and responsibility. If democracy happens in a world as a dialogue with others, than jonassian politics, which concern the very possibility of world and life that does not speak (as in the case of the unborn), are not démocratie: yet their démocratie element has to be invented. The bold and provocative philosophy of Hans Jonas' mature period1 is an at tempt to answer a single burning question: how could life be an object of respon sibility} Or, to put it in another way: given that our time is determined by the overwhelming presence of technology, how can we get aware of the require ments of life on the one hand, and of responsibility on the other? Technology, as a domain of inanimate and extramoral processes, generates a tendency to ex clude the fundamental experiences of life and responsibility from the domain of thought and to assign them to the vague région of feeling and faith. Henceforth, the task of philosophy is to comprehend life and responsibility and, what is mo re, to show the fundamental interdependence of these two problems that might, at the outset, seem to exclude one another. In my paper, I will examine one aspect of this vast problem, namely the con cept of life that, according to Hans Jonas, can also open onto ethical considéra tions. I will start by presenting some methodological problems. Then I will dis cuss Jonas' concept of life. Finally I will présent some outlines of the political conséquences of Jonas' theory. 1 ticism Since the publication of Thephenomenon of Life in 1966. Jonas' earlier work treated rι.

Jonas' work is often will ingly outrageous. Despite his phenomenological origins, he thinks in terms of teleology instead of intentionality, or of freedom and necessity instead of possi bility and impossibility, and he cherishes the notions of interiority and exteri ority.2 In général, he braves the phenomenological interdiction to step beyond the phenomena: not that he would propose a hidden ground that would justify the existence of life on earth, but his description surpasses the given towards cer tain rational constructions. For him, life is not the problem of the „living pré sence" in phenomenological observation. Life is an ontological problem.3 Now, we know how Heidegger reopened the ontological problem as the question of human existence, and of the totality of being as far as it becomes Da sein's question. From his perspective, the living being as such appears to be in compréhensible and disquieting,4 and that is how, Jonas observes, nature ends by practically falling outside of Heidegger's thought (perhaps confined solely to technoscience).5 Jonas turns precisely towards this nature, whose being has, from Kant to Heidegger, been defined as the limit of the philosophical inter rogation, like an undescribable black hole that indistinctly gives being and retires its grounds. Heidegger might still agree with Jonas' way of taking nature's being 2 This vocabulary probably makes him more understandable to the scientific modernity that he is primarily addressing. However, a present-day reader would appreciate the supple mentary précision he might have achieved if he had confronted some of his predecessors more direcdy: the 19th Century philosophers of nature (who share his concepts) and modern phe nomenologists (who share his questions). 3 Das Prinzip Leben.

Frankfurt a.M. 1976. 323. 5 „Nie hat eine Philosophie sich so wenig um die Nature gekümmert wie der Existentia lismus [i.e. Heidegger in Sein und Zeit\, für den sie keine Würde behalten hat." (PL 369). However, Jonas' principle of life is not alien to Heidegger's thought but on the contrary an extension of a Heideggerian way of thinking into a domain that the latter would finally have overlooked. To put it briefly, if Heidegger's thought opens out from the experience of death and Arendt's from the phenomenon of „natality", Jonas examines what happens between these absolute limits starting from the fundamental experience of hunger. In truth, Jonas' prin ciple of life could be interpreted as a Heideggerian interprétation of Aristotle's De Anima. And in fact, his very first experience of live philosophising was Heidegger's seminar on Aristotle's De Anima m 1921. (Wissenschaft als persönliches Erlebnis. Göttingen 1987. 14.) Furthermore, Jonas' approach resembles Heidegger's description of the animality in Grundbegriffe der Meta physik - on which Jonas does not comment, unfortunately for us. We will see how Jonas, like Heidegger, examines the animal's „selfness" and justifies this through our possible „privative access" to the animality, that he bases on out capacity to follow a living being's experience, if not share it (GA 29/30. § 49). Cf. Françoise Dastur: Pour une zoologie ,privative', ou com ment ne pas parler de l'animal. In: Alter 3 (1995).</page><page sequence="3">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 177 as a groundless givenness.6 But Heidegger would not follow Jonas' effort to de fîne the essence of this nature, and wonder not only tbat it is and how it is, but what it is. Through the question what? Jonas enters into the domain of spécula tions, rational constructions and even of mythological illustrations.7 What is life? Can we „see" it; can we answer to such a question without spéculation? Is Jonas right in claiming that représentation - and consequendy spéculation - is peculiar to man to such an extent that, contrary to what Heidegger says, the faculty of images and the corrélative conception of truth as adaequatio are more originary than truth as aletbeial8 The very possibility of Jonas' philosophical biology dé pends on this supposition that he practices consciously without treating it exten sively. Life as nature's being might be for us stränge and most mysterious. Now Jo nas does not ponder on the secrecy of the secret but claims, on the contrary, that we can understand (if not necessarily know) the essence of life. According to him, we can understand life because we are living ourselves.9 This leads to two movements. Firstly, we understand the living thanks to a kind of a sympatby or an affinity which allows us to recognise another life experience, even if, on the other hand, its singular experience is precisely what we cannot share.10 Secondly, we understand lower life forms by privation (for instance, the animais have senses without images, the plants have metabolism without senses, etc.). In this way, Jonas establishes a hierarchy of being which Starts from pure matter, de velops through the simplest living organisms through the higher animais up to the human being.11 Now from an epistemological point of view, these move ments are intolérable: imagining another living being's experience through ana log! with ourselves and establishing a hierarchy of beings whose summit we our selves are is an anthropomorphic gesture that relies on imagination. Jonas recognises and assumes this outrage, as well. To Start with, Jonas understands life as an experience and an event, which are in any case outside of ordinary epi stemological approaches. Either we admit the possibility of somehow under standing another being's experience, or we back ourselves into a sceptic's so lipsism, which Jonas takes to be simply a logical illusion. 6 „Le secret des commencements nous demeure cachée" (Évolution et libérté [Henceforth ÉL], Paris 2000. 29). 7 PL 10. 8 The chapter ,Vom Ursprung der Wahrheitserfahrung', PL 292-301. 9 PL 155. ÉL 38. 10 Actually, Jonas says that we do not understand the other by projecting ourselves on him, but on the contrary we understand ourselves because the other (for instance an animal) ex presses and communicates to us his experience. ÉL 96-105. 11 PL 45.</page><page sequence="4">178 Susanna Lindberg In the last instance however, Jonas justifies his presumed „intellectual faults" with an ethical concern. For example, contrary to what Descartes claimed and although we cannot prove it, Jonas thinks that we know that animais can suffer, and that is why we must treat them as feeling créatures. And whatever logical errors this might entail, we are ethically obliged to bring this knowledge into the sphere of philosophy, instead of leaving it to the vague domain of feeling, religi on and conviction. On the other hand, putting the human being at the summit of the living world and attributing to him a certain „nobility" is certainly dis turbing - but for Jonas, it primarily means that we have an ethical responsibility towards the rest of nature, whereas the inverse is not true. The human being's „nobility" does not make him the master and commander of nature without en gaging a most demanding responsibility that corresponds to the human power of dévastation. Such an approach is anthropocentric and even biblical, but it is not nonsensical. It can be elucidated through a comparision to Levinas' position. Levinas also thinks that we cannot share the Other's experience, but we know that he has one, and this knowledge contributes to our responsibility for him. Jonas simply extends such a responsibility to all of the living world and to its fu ture, and tries to find out what we actually can know about another living being's life - knowing that we cannot live it. By giving an onto logical foundation to an ethics, Jonas is conscious of making a disputable move. Such an approach is presently accepted neither by „applied ethics" nor by „discourse ethics" nor by the phenomenological ethics of, say, Levinas.12 Heidegger, Jonas' professor and closest reference, would not use his „ontology" in order to found an ethical imperative; and Arendt, Jonas' lifelong friend, would not found her political considérations on an ontological doctrine. Jonas knows and accepts this, and feels nevertheless an urge to brave what he takes to be a properly modern interdiction. I think that in the last instance, we could justify his approach by stating that the living as such, being incapable of speech and even of the pure address that defines Levinas' Other, is definitely in capable of demanding justice in the sphere of politics.13 In order to cope with the unease this silence créâtes, we need another view of the foundations of the po litical. In this regard, the sciences cannot help us, because they have precisely caused this unease by transforming the natural being into a mere object. In this 12 On Jonas' and Levinas' disagreement concerning the need of an ontology in an ethics, see Pierre Bourez: Témoins du futur. Philosophie et messianisme. Paris 2003. 811. 833. 851. 13 Here I mainly follow Giorgio Agamben's theory of the politics of life in Homo sacer and L'Ouvert. De l'homme et de l'animal, which correspond to Jacques Derrida's analyses of the relation between justice and language (for instance in Force de loi but also in many other recent works). Following their indications, one could take the absolute impossibility of sharing a lan guage with the simply-living as the basis of the political dilemma that it constimtes.</page><page sequence="5">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 179 context, Jonas' définition of life as an experience also becomes an inquiry into what, in bare life, can appeal to us and engage our responsibility. Jonas does not conclude on a Schopenhauerian compassion nor on an overwhelming obligation in regard to the living. But he endeavors to redetermine the minimal, formal re quirements of an ethical situation. For instance: the object of responsibility must be capable of life - présent, future or past life. And henceforth: the human being's responsibility, being such that he must do what he can, must finally en compass life itself as that which has become his most vulnerable other. Jonas' theory of life Naturally, all of the aforementioned problems must finally be judged in relation to Jonas' theory of life. So, what does Jonas understand by „life"? For Jonas, life is an ontological category. It is his interprétation of being that is particularly indebted to Aristotle's On the Soul and to Heidegger's teaching. In The Pnnciple of Life, he reminds us of the two principal points of view on life in the history of western thought.14 The Ancients considered being in général as life (and confronted death as the major inexplicable mystery). On the contrary, since the Renaissance the Modems saw natural beings as lifeless bodies sub mitted to mechanical movements (henceforth, life is the inexplicable problem). Tuming against the prevailing scientific world view much in the same way as Heidegger in his critique of the epoch of the technique, Jonas does not seek to re-establish the antique vision of nature as the sacred. Instead, he wishes to pierce the contemporary, scientific world view's blind spot by opening an onto logy of life that modem sciences would présupposé and yet ignore, or even re press. This is why he articulâtes a biological ontology which, according to him, also implies all technologies and human sciences. In what follows, I will présent Jonas' theory of life through three key con cepts: being, seif and teleology. " PL ch. 1.</page><page sequence="6">180 Susanna Lindberg 1. Being Life is Jonas' interprétation of being. A living being does not subsist, like the dead body of cartesian mechanics. Its being is a having-to-be.15 It is purely its own act of being.16 It ressembles Heidegger's Dasein,17 whose existence is a purely transitive having-to-be, except that a living being as such, for instance an amoeba, does not question its own being: the différence between Jonas' „life" and Heidegger's „existence" is precisely this question that reveals existence, and not life, to itself. Life remains an ontological category because the living being's having-to-be is its struggle with its nonbeing.18. Life is a being's auto-affirmation against the con stant and overwhelming possibility of its nonbeing. In other words, life is essen tially mortal, and according to Jonas all living beings, and not only man, know the anguish before death.19 A living being is a tension between birth and death, coming from nothing and passing on to nothing and, stretched between these absolute limits, is a constant becoming. 2. Self and World According to Jonas' fundamental thesis, any living being as such is a self.20 This is a controversial point. It has been said that Jonas' concept of self is a mere transposition of the human being's own self-understanding onto all living be ings: it would be a preconstituted entity that prevents us from seeing life as an auto-constitution and an individuation.21 However, as Jonas says that seif is not 15 PL 158.

As Strachan Donneley puts it in ,Hans Jonas: La philosophie de la nature et l'éthique de la responsabilité', the „no to non-being" makes being „fundamentally dramatic" (Études phénoménologiques 8 (1988). 81). 19 PL 19-21. 20 Rex. PL 39. ÉL 46. 21 Jonas' notion of selfness disturbs, for instance, Renaud Barbaras. In an excellent study, which is also rare because it specifically treats Jonas' concept of life, he states that Jonas' self ness présupposés a preconstituted individuality, which prevents him from seeing „the true be ing of life" (La phénoménologie de la vie chez Hans Jonas. In: Vie et intentionnalité. Recher ches phénoménologiques. Paris 2003. 50) and from developing an „authentic phenomenology of life" (op. cit. 54). However, I believe one should apply to Jonas himself the phrase that Bar baras wants to direct against him: „We have to understand life not as a property of an already constituted living being, but as the act by which it constitutes itself and individuates itself." (Op. cit. 54.)</page><page sequence="7">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 181 a stable State but a free movement of creating oneself from one instant to an other, the issue is far from being evident.22 I believe the difficulty is due less to the utilisation of the notion of „seif" than to the slight obscurity of Jonas' notion of „form". What does Jonas mean by „seif"? Selfness is always a relation to oneself. When selfriess characterises even the simplest living beings, like amoebas, it cannot be a self-consciousness. In this regard, the simple définition of life as a having-to-be opens up the dimension of primitive selfriess: here the simple ontological auto affirmation bends the living being back onto itself. For Jonas, the question of selfriess is coextensive with the question of the world. According to him, living means being-in-a-world and having-a-world or, in other words, life is a transcendence.23 The ontological character of having-a world présents the world as the „other" that does not just occur to the living be ing but conditions its very possibility of being. This „other" is the second factor that turns the living being back onto itself. When for Heidegger, the human be ing has a world and the living being is poor-of-world,24 Jonas considers that all living beings have a world, whereas the human being's distinctive feature would be his capacity of baving himself too, in his images, which would be impossible for the animais.25 However, when the relation to the world is defined as a bav ing, whether it be „rieh" or „poor", it means that the living being is not one with its world but separated from it; this séparation is characterised by the living be ing's effort to appropriate (something of) its world. In other words, seif is not coextensive with the world but oddly separated from it. Mortality and world-relation determine the finitude of the living being. Ac cording to Jonas, the living being's birth and death open up a primary temporal sense of life's finitude. The otherness of the world opens up a primary spatial sense of the living being's finitude.26 As both dimensions of life's finitude have 22 Jonas says: „Das Selbst des einzelnen Lebens ist allem Übrigen als Außenwelt oder Fremdem entgegengesetzt - doch ebendie Entgegensetzung aktualisiert sich, durch die .Tran szendenz' (die auf ihr beruht und das Verhältnis des Gegenüber vom Selbst her vollzieht), als Aufnahme des Äußeren - qua Äußeren - in das Innen oder das Außer-sich-sein des Innen beim Äußeren. [...] Schließlich die Hinfälligkeit dieser Existenz, die die direkte Kehrseite der Souveränität ihrer Selbststiftung ist: Die sich konstituierende Identität, eben weil sie von Au genblick zu Augenblick funktionelles Erzeugnis und nicht bestehender Zustand ist, ist von prekärer, widerruflicher Dauer..."

In passing, we can note that because the li ving being's essence is its exposure to something other, there are necessarily ma ny beings: the idea of exposure and the idea of the plurality of being go hand in hand and one supposes the other. Jonas studies the world relation of the living being on three levels, which cor respond to the divisions of Aristotle's Pen Psyché·. 1. metabolism, 2. the animal's perception, movement and feeling, and 3. the human being's capacity of imag ing. On the most elementary level, any living being as such „has a world" in its metabolism. Metabolism is generally discarded from philosophical reflection as a simple process of absorption and excrétion in view of remaining the same. On the contrary, Jonas gives it a highly philosophical status as the fürst, ontological manifestation of freedom.27 Of course, a living being's freedom is conditional: the exterior world is a domain of necessity facing it. It is as impossible to choose another factual world as it is to choose one's birth or immortality. Nevertheless, it is a freedom: metabolism shows that a living being is not just an inert object of external influences but it relates actively to its environment. Even on the sim plest level, metabolism is „creative" because it implies choice and chance.28 Metabolism produces a division of interiority and exteriority (and not the other way round: interiority and exteriority are not preconstituted, self-suf ficient entities but are constituted in this intercourse). The interiority is consti tuted as an affection of something „exterior" in such a way that the affected be ing becomes affected itself.29 Jonas says that the living being is exposed:30 in the core of its being it is open to the world. In other words, a living being's seif is an ecstasy, that is to say something that has the ground of its being outside of itself. There is no separate interiority into which the living being might retire, for its interiority is its exposition to the exterior world. So the living being is simulta neously separated from the world and open to it, and it is this exception in the midst of the tissue of being. Jonas calls this relation of „having a world" (which also implies the possibility of missing it and being mistaken about it) an experience.M It is a free experience of constituting oneself with what the world gives or denies, an experience where choice and hazard play fundamental roles. This experience is essentially tempo 27 PL 153. ÉL 27 f. 28 Cf. PL 161. ÉL 48. 29 PL 161. 30 PL 181. ÉL 47. 31 PL 159. ÉL 46.</page><page sequence="9">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 183 ral: the living being's self is never ready but it is constituted anew every instant.32 Yet as far as there is a self-identity, Jonas thinks we must suppose an elementary temporal synthesis of such changing states,33 and this implies that in an elemen tary sense all living beings have a memory and a relation to the future34 or, rather, a trace and a desire of experience. In the juncture of exposition and alterity, life is an originary auto-production, auto-mimesis or auto-technique - it is the originary movement of pbysis such as Aristode has presented it. Below, we will corne to certain critical points which might delimit the scope of this affirmation. The fundamental freedom of life is rooted in metabolism, but its advenmrous character becomes manifest in animal life. When pure metabolism is based on contact, the proper character of animal life is distance, „Abständigkeit".11 Thanks to the distance, the animal is not simply surrounded by an immédiate exterio rity, but synthesises a real space-time, a genuine world. The distance has three principal dimensions:36 perception opens out a spatial and proto-theoretical gap; mobility opens out a temporal, proto-practical gap, and feeling relates the animal to itself as a desiring, teleologically active créature who is always separated from its aims. The animal is essentially a being of passion,37 where passion dénotés a distance from the source of desire. Its freedom is manifested in its capacity to transcend itself by responding to its passion with an action. According to Jonas, such an action has a teleological character. Being the root of any living being's action, teleology is not a conscious, willing procédure but a constant, instinctive invention, by which the animal reaches out towards the source of its passion: its world and, correlatively, itself. Teleology is a way of following the détour (Um weg)1* through the world that brings the living being back to itself. Let me put it in other words: if metabolism shows life as a border within the world, animal life shows the width of this border. This width is an absolute abyss that the animal crosses constandy without ever closing the gap (each cros sing is a leap over an impossibility of rejoining the edges). Animality means crossing the distance towards the world and following the détour through the world. Its multiple activity could be Condensed in the archaic polysemy of the word „sense" that has often been pointed out: the animal senses its world, feels 32 PL 155. ÉL 43. 33 PL 152.

ÉL 54.</page><page sequence="10">184 Susanna Lindberg itself, acts in the direction of its being-in-the-world, and finally the capacity of such a sensible directedness can be called the animal's sense, if not „reason". Jonas locates the third kind of a world relation in the „transanimality" of the human being. This is not the place to présent Jonas' theory of the human being. I simply State that for him, the differentia specifica of man is his capacity of ima ging. The capacity of imaging extends the human world far beyond the simple animal opening towards absent places, times and persons (and not simply distant ones). The image gives place to fiction and theory, and it equally founds the pos sibility of a genuine social world. In order to have a füll idea of the transanimali ty of the human being, we still ought to consider homo pictor's capacity of re sponsibility. For the human being's responsibility is for Jonas a massive thesis, even if he does not include the ethical specificity of the human being in his dé duction of différent forms of life. I think that in the end, the human being's ca pacity of responsibility is finally the most human counterpart of the straight forward teleology of life. Such would be the outlines of Jonas' theory of selfness that is developed through différent ways of „having a world". Let me now return to the problem I mentioned earlier. Does Jonas' recourse to the notion of „seif" exclude him from a genuine phenomenology of life? No doubt this is so if the phenomeno logical rigour obliges us to constrain ourselves to what appears. However, when one examines another being's experience one necessarily confronts something that does not présent itself to us, and I think nothing prevents us from calling such an experience a selfness in an ontological considération. But in that case, such a „seif" is more than a simple extrapolation of the human self-conscious ness onto other living beings: it refers to the singular plurality of existence. One problem remains, however. Jonas often assimilâtes his notions of „seif" and „identity" to that of „form". In conséquence, he often explains metabolism as if the self met the world simply like a form meets matter: filling itself with différ ent materials but remaining fundamentally „same".39 Such a view on meta bolism, especially if it is extended to perception, movement, feeling and image, is effectively outdated. Moreover, this interprétation of self-identity contradicts Jonas' own ontological point of view, according to which metabolism is pre cisely the origin of the most fundamental freedom and creativity, thanks to which the living being precisely does not remain the same.40 In order to evaluate this incohérence - which remains indelible in Jonas' system - we have to exam ine Jonas' notion of form more closely, which is for him a teleological issue. 39 PL 151-156. 40 According to Jonas, this should already be evident through the observation of various ages of most living beings: PL 119.</page><page sequence="11">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 185 3. Teleology Jonas explains life's becoming as an internal teleology - and he does it rather mischievously, knowing that teleological explanations have long since been dis carded from science and philosophy.41 At stake is then the understanding of the very essence of teleology. Jonas refers to Aristotle's présentation of the teleologi cal movement of life42 but he modifies it by examining the teleological constitu tion of the form expressly as a movement of being. Jonas opts for teleology in order to avoid certain dead ends in the con sidération of living beings. According to him, the mechanist explanations simply miss the phenomenon of life, and there is certainly no point in returning to crea tionist ones, either.43 Darwinism does not take us much further, because the only resource it accords to the living being is adaptation, whereas Jonas stresses the importance of life's creative responses to the external situations.44 Teleology is for him the name of a situation where a freedom confronts a necessity. It mainly characterises a selfs relation to its world. The living being is not some thing that could reach out towards an outer world: it is this gesture of reaching out; its activity is moving towards the world and Coming back to itself. This endless transcending, this détour, is the fundamental sense of its teleological acti vity. Jonas' explication of „having a world" shows how teleology is the law of making contact and traversing a distance, crossing a gap and following the détour. Teleology is for Jonas the law of the experience that reveals the concrète space time. But what is teleology, if it can thus give law to something that by définition does not tolerate any law, that is to say, to experience? On the first level, Jonas' teleology is simply the law of the living being's activ ity based on its desire: it is the being's own capacity of setting goals and pursu ing them by différent means.45 Even if we cannot really distinguish to what ex tent an aim is given by the world (an occasion) and to what extent it is set by the agent (a desire), we can consider it as being internal to the agent. The aim, 41 What are the advantages of speaking in terms of teleology instead of intentionality when, as it should become evident in what follows, they describe very similar movements? Firstly, intentionality primarily describes a schématisation of the world, whereas teleology is also a movement of being. Intentionality is included in teleology. Secondly, for Jonas, access to the questions of being préparé the ground for an ethical inquiry, presupposing that the foundation of ethics is finally a question of birth and death. I could add a third motivation, even though Jonas does not treat it: teleology provides a link to the 19th Century philosophy of life which is a more or less secret motivation of ail the phénoménologies of life. « PL 16. « PL 65. 44 PL 91. 45 PL 163. Cf. ÉL 41 : „il faut comprendre comme acte le factum morphologique de la con tinuité métabolisante."</page><page sequence="12">186 Susanna Lindberg however, remains somewhat external to the action itself and commands it as a value. On a more fundamental level, underlying and motivating such partial teleo logical actions, the internai teleology of life itself does not follow any even relati vely external values. Its activity has no other reason than itself. Teleology ex plains the movement of being itself: the act of being. If teleology commands the primary act of being, its aim is to be - and not to realise and maintain a prede termined form, whether that is understood as the platonic idea of, say, a perfect horse or as the genetic code of a horse.46 Naturally, in one way or another, such a form is realised in the being's life, but this realization does not command its teleologkal activity. Structurally, it is a part of the necessity that constitutes the being's world: it only provides a framework within which the actual activity re mains free or, in other words, it détermines the particular conditions for a singu lar activity. Teleology commands being in its singularityS7 Finally, the teleology of life aims at being alive, only this aim is no longer a value (an external aim), but rather an internai, unconditional good. The originary judgment at the root of the teleological movement of the living being is: it is good to live. In other words: life is not a value and it does not aim at survival as the highest value. The teleology of the living being is an internai teleology, and that is why it does not proceed from a form, if form is understood as a morphological figure, a stable idea or a superior intemporal being. Such a form, presented as the cause and the end of the process, is always an external principle, whereas life is a pro cess of internai teleology. However, an internai teleology can be said to proceed from another kind of a form: a form of form-giving itself. We could say that in stead of reproducing a form as if it were a model, it créâtes one. The proper name of such a form is freedom, which is, according to Jonas, a „fundamental ontological character of life as such".48 On this fundamental ontological level the exercise of freedom does not aim at a stable product of a free will. Its aim is free dom itself, and the form of freedom is precisely the émancipation from given, predetermined forms. That is why the internai teleology is not a stable process of reproducing the same, but, at the limits of the being's finitude, a surprising and even a creative event - and for Jonas, such a free event is precisely what can be described as a teleology rather than as a process. In fact, the form created by the internai teleology is entirely dynamic: it is a capacity of being. On more spe cified levels of analysis, Jonas shows that the internai teleology is also the capaci ty to be what one is, only once again this does not mean incorporating a definite 46 PL 89 f. 47 „Singularité et hétérogénéité radicales [...] voilà ce qui caractérise l'ipséité de l'orga nisme."

Nothing is said of the eventual products of such capacities, for it is a question of opening capacities, remaining capable, and becoming capa ble of facing new situations. Teleology does not follow ideas, it creates them; such ideas in their turn are no stable entities but rather traces of events. Teleolo gy is a capacity of creating a capacity.49 The form produced by such an internal teleology is a capacity of being: firstly the sheer capacity of being alive; secondly the supplementary capacities of me tabolism, sense, movement, feeling, image, etc. On all levels, the teleological ac tivity simultaneously requires and produces an openness of senses and a free dom of actions. For Jonas, the proper character of life is that its means become ends in themselves.50 Life is not a simple question of surviving but also a ques tion of what survives: which capacities seek their plénitude.51 Now we see that the pure capacity of being alive is an individual one: existence takes place in sin gular beings. On the other hand, the specific capacities, if not their particular use, are proper to entire species, and we could take them for forms in a more traditional sense. Jonas does not make specific analyses of such particular forms. Evidently he does not take them for eternal ideas, but he does not give a specific analysis of the temporality of the forms, either: he hardly mentions the problem of the origin of the species and finally says litde about their possible extinction. There is one exeption, however: the human being himself. Jonas does not meditate on his origin nor destination, but he asserts that we ought to preserve the „image of man". Now if the proper nature of life is freedom, and if human freedom includes the capacities of technical auto-transformation and even suici de, why should we suddenly restrain the use of this freedom within the limits of the human being such as he is presendy? This is a very complicated question that cannot be treated without entering into the question of Hans Jonas' politics. 49 A thorough évaluation of Jonas' teleology requires a confrontation with Nietzsche. Jo nas' teleology resembles Nietzsche's will to power, but breaks with it, since Jonas' life does not seek power as such but a qualified power, a positive capacity which is not simply a pure and empty capacity. A more précisé comparision with Nietzsche might explain, for instance, why Jonas seems to limit the growth of life's capacities on the „image of man", that he surprisingly refuses to change - even if a critérium of this „image of man" is an eternity that resembles Nietzsche's eternal return of the same (PL 383 and the ensuing explication of immortality). 50 ÉL 56.

In the last instance, his conception of life does not corre spond to specific scientific questions nor to purely philosophical contemplation. It takes responsibility for an ethics, an „ethics of the technological civilisation"52 and opens onto a political considération. Jonas addresses the problem of life because, according to him, only the living can be an object of a responsibility, even if this possibility does not entail an obli gation.53 The responsibility does not encompass Being as a whole (Sein), because its being or nonbeing does not dépend on us,54 whereas the living (Lebendiges) are by définition those whose being is precarious and vulnerable. On the other hand, in contrast to the traditional ethical théories, the responsibility should not encompass the human being alone. For Jonas, this is not so much because of a compassion towards différent living beings nor because of the admiration of the beauty of nature,55 but because man's existence is entirely conditioned by the na ture of which he is a part. Jonas' categorical responsibility Starts where existence is at stake: that is why it addresses life as such. The ethical responsibility towards nature has anthropocentric grounds, and that is why Jonas' famous imperative commands: „act in such a way that the effects of your action are compatible with permanency of an authentically hu man life on the earth."56 In its apparent simplicity, the imperative has very complicated implications. Firstly, if Jonas criticises traditional ethics for applying solely to man57 and expends so much effort in order to show the fundamen tal unity of man and nature,58 why does he end by restoring the primacy of man? One can answer by stating that Jonas' argument might be necessarily an thropomorphic but is not anthropocentric, since the center of Jonas' thought is an ontology of being as metabolism, which is not a specifically human con-dition, even if we find it through the considération of the human be 52 Versuch einer Ethik für die Technologische Zivilisation is the subtitle of Das Prinzip Verant wortung (PV) (Frankfurt a.M. 1984). 53 „Nur das Lebendige also in seiner Bedürftigkeit und Bedrohtheit - und im Prinzip alles Lebendige - kann überhaupt Gegenstand von Verantwortung sein, muß es aber darum noch nicht sein: ein Lebendes zu sein ist erst die notwendige Bedingung dafür im Gegenstande."

PL 17.</page><page sequence="15">Hans Jonas' Theory of Life 189 ing.59 Nevertheless, the very formulation of Jonas' imperative only addresses human life, not life as such. Jonas certainly accords a specific value to human life such as we know it. Firsdy, the „transanimality of man",60 that is to say his ca pacity of image, is for Jonas a good in itself. But actually, without really stating it in this way, Jonas shows above all that the human being's capacity of responsibil ity, and the ensuing obligation to be responsible, sets him apart from all other living beings. Only the human being, and not the rest of nature, must be respon sible. And the human being is also responsible for this possibility of responsibili ty that one finds nowhere eise in nature: he is responsible for himself as the being capable of responsibility. This brings us to another difficulty, namely to the question of what the „au thentically human life" might be. At times Jonas say s that we should conserve the „image of man". Is not such a recourse to an authentkity and even to an idea most suspect? Should we not reject as metaphysico-theological even his maxim according to which the extinction of the human species is an evil per se, and that any action that might cause it is therefore prohibited?61 Why, indeed, should the human species exist and why should its existence be somehow „authentic"? To begin with, Jonas' „image of man" is not a détermination, a specific quality nor a stable form.62 On the contrary, he evokes it in order to thwart the desire to pro duce the „perfect man" that characterised certain modern utopias. Jonas' im perative rather commands the préservation of the finitude and the openness of the human being's essence.63 Or, to speak like Heidegger, the human being's es sence should remain a question. Strictly speaking, Jonas' imperative only en globes the existence of man: we should not détermine how the future man can live, but only that he can live.64 In this sense, the imperative only aims at avoid ing the total extinction, and does this by preserving the possibility of a future world, not the reality of its inhabitants. More exactly, Jonas does not reduce life to a mere fact of existing, but he includes certain qualifications: the originary freedom of any living being and the responsibility of the human being. The con servation of an authentically human life means the conservation of these capaci ties. It does not mean that we should predetermine how this freedom should be 59 This is Carlos Foppa's argument in: L'être humain dans la philosophie de la biologie.

For instance, it is properly human to kill other living beings and hu mans.65 It is also properly human to form oneself according to various images which also, by nature, restrain one's freedom.66 But Jonas' imperative requires us to prevent these possibilities of murder and control from totally extinguishing human freedom and responsibility.67 Finally, Jonas has been severely criticised for his doubts concerning the capa city of democracy of taking on the responsibility for future life. Indeed, he sus pects that the only form of government that can let future weigh more in its dé cisions than the immédiate Utility would be a government of a few wise persons in the style of Plato's Republic.M Of course, this is a terrifying and „chimerical" idea that Jonas does not find désirable.69 However, because certain opponents have not hesitated to conclude that Jonas actually promotes a totalitarian solu tion,70 I feel obliged to touch the problem. Even Jonas' personal experience should explain why he is firmly opposed to all kinds of totalitarianism. On the contrary, he défends political liberties as being indispensable for human dignity.71 But if the ethics for a technological civilisation cannot be realised by a mass, it does not dépend on the sole individual, either: in this sense, it is a genuinely po litical task with no definite solution in view. Jonas distinguishes his ethics of the « PV 246 f. 66 PV 289-292. 67 In Prinzip Verantwortung, Jonas singles out two main threats to human existence. The possibility of the total extinction of humankind is naturally incarnated in a nuclear disaster or, more generally, in an overwhelming ecocatastrophe. The possibility of the extinction of hu man freedom and capacity of responsibility is incarnated in certain social techniques like pré natal sélection and the administration of tranquillizers to children (PV 50-53): in these cases, the possibility of an internal teleological action is thwarted by the imposition of an overpowe ring external aim. 68 „Dies erhebt die alte Frage nach der Macht der Weisen [...] Welche Kraft soll die Zu kunft in der Gegenwart vertreten? Das ist eine Frage für die politische Philosophie, zu der ich meine eigenen, wahrscheinlich chimärischen und sicher unpopulären Ideen habe."

Engelhardt. 16. 71 PV 298 f. 304 f. However, as Jonas does not analyse in detail the question of political freedom, the question of the diversity and discord permitted by the „image of man" remains open. In this vein, Nathalie Depraz argues that Jonas ignores the question of human plurality and that his thought lacks a démocratie dimension, whereas Markus Dederich argues, on the contrary, that Jonas' ethics is precisely not based on exclusion but reposes on alterity and dif férence.

Messianism can only wait for the Messiah but not act in view of his arrivai, whereas action is henceforth necessary. Utopism rather closes than opens the future, for by wanting to reform man it generally ends by fettering his freedom. This implies, among others, that Jonas' „counsel of the wise" should not act on man himself, this being the task of each generation's own présent politics. It should simply preserve the most général possibility of human life, and therefore also the possibility of his political life. Its task is a critical control of the technology, not of the political society, which must follow its own destinies. Since Hans Jonas' ethics examines our responsibility towards those who are not yet born, it cannot address any singular existence or selfness. His uncondi tional imperative only encompasses the possibility of the existence of a future humanity, in other words, it only commands the préservation of a worid as the condition sine qua non of any human existence as such. Such a task cannot open onto a specific political strategy: it rather requires the invention of a politics ca pable of preserving its own ultimate conditions.</page></plain_text>
