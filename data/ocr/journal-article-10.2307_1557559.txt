<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AV\/NT-GA OMATON TWO COLLAGES BY STUART DAVIS BARBARA Z ABE L The recent retrospective of the works of Stuart Davis amply demonstrated that the early 1920s were a turning point in his career. At this time Davis formulated a new mode of working, one rooted more in construction than mimesis. The prolific journals he kept from 1920 to 1922 reveal his excitement about this new conception of art making which marked his conversion to modernism. In the spring of 1921, for example, Davis proclaimed, "My ten years of work have given me the power of expression and freed me from the tyranny of nature, and I feel that the next few years should enable me to do some really original American work."' While much attention has been devoted to Davis's simulated collages-the Tobacco series he began in 1921-Davis scholarship has not sufficiently addressed his experiments in actual collage, which were seminal in freeing the artist "from the tyranny of nature" and in establishing a dialogue with machine culture in Amer- ica.2 Increasingly, the machine became the governing metaphor for the modern era, and avant-garde artists like Davis attempted to comprehend this in their art. Two collages by Davis, ITLKSEZ and Untitled, both from 1921, introduced what I call the avant-garde automaton, and opened up new aesthetic avenues which the artist ex- plored for the remainder of his career. In distinct contrast to collage in France, where Braque and Picasso initially favored studio and cafe still-life subjects, in America many early collages featured the human figure. Paradoxically, this can be seen as a direct function of the dominant role of the machine in our culture, an assertion validated by the way in which American artists portrayed human images. Thus, early collage constructions of avant-garde artists including Davis, Arthur Dove, and Man Ray suggest that machines and human beings are anatomical analogues. Although this was an idea first introduced into New York Dada by Marcel Duchamp, for instance in Nude Descending the Staircase of 1912, the American artists' fixation on-and construction of-the human figure as a kind of anonymous automaton illuminates much about the problematic relationship between American culture and the machine. Man Ray was perhaps the first American artist to pick up on the implications of Duchamp's mechanomorphic constructions. As I have argued elsewhere, Man Ray gravitated toward figurative collage in 1915, as seen in such works as Dance, in which the painted forms are beginning to look as if they were cut out with scissors and pasted on the canvas. "I changed my style com- pletely," he wrote in 1963, "reducing human figures to flat-patterned disarticulated forms."4 He bends the joints-as if he simply cut, or in his words "disarticu- lated," the planar forms of the arms and legs. Even if made by hand, the parts of the dancers seem to be prefabricated, separable, and manipulable. The artist continued to experiment with such ostensibly mechani- cal ways of assembling figures in the following year, most definitively in a series of ten collages entitled Revolving Doors. The first work in the series, Mime, with its head and outstretched arms constructed of strips of colored paper, still signifies the anthropomorphic; yet now, more explicitly than in Dance, the method of fabrication refers to the mechanical. We are reminded that collage is an art of construction rather than transcription, an art of design made up of related parts analogous to the functionally interrelated parts of machines. These collages thus can II</page><page sequence="2">be seen as visual personifications of the new machine environment.' Somewhat later, Arthur Dove joined Man Ray in this new mode of automaton construction, executing several figurative "object portraits." Most revealing for our pur- poses is The Critic of 1925, a collage of cardboard, news- paper, and magazine advertisements. The irony here is that while the magnifying glass hanging around the critic's neck implies attention to detail, the roller skates and vacuum cleaner with which the critic is also equipped suggest hasty and indiscriminate consumption of information-even of trash. Through such juxtaposi- tions Dove has satirically exposed the critic as a kind of dehumanized product of the modern age, functioning more like a robot outfitted with mechanical appendages than a human endowed with insight and thoughtfulness. ITLKSEZ of 1921, a work executed in watercolor and collage, announced Stuart Davis's entry into the domain of nontraditional figure construction. The work features abstracted shapes comprising a black-faced figure below which Davis has pasted the letters of the title. A decade earlier, Picasso had stenciled letters-MA JOLIE-across the bottom of a painting, the phrase functioning simul- taneously as the title, as a reminder of the painting's flatness, and as the clue to the painting's source in popular culture, in this case a popular song. Rather than paint the letters as did Picasso, Davis cut out and pasted letters on the surface where they too functioned as the title and as an indicator of both flatness and meaning. Shorthand for "it looks easy," the title alludes not only to commercial lettering-to popular culture-but more significantly to the common American putdown of mod- ernism, and particularly to Synthetic Cubism with its seemingly simple relationships of flat forms.6 Perhaps the title can also be read as an ironical reference to the artist's initial response to modernism. After seeing the Armory Show, Davis wrote, "That settled it. I would be a modern artist. So easy. Except for one small matter: how?"7 Through collage Davis satirically exposed the prevalent attitude-as well as his own initial reaction-to modem art in this country, while at the same time formulating a way of working which would be expressive of what he called "the widened consciousness of the age."8 For Davis this "widened consciousness" was grounded in the mechanical ethos of the time. Just as the title, ITLKSEZ, requires decoding, since its meaning is not at first apparent, the figure also must be analyzed in a new way. Even though, as in Man Ray's Dance, the figure here is not composed of actual collage elements, the effect is that of collage; that is, a sense of disjunction is main- tained in the juxtaposition of the component parts, and it becomes clear that simulated collage is as capable as actual collage of embodying principles of machine con- struction. In presenting the human figure almost as if it were an automaton, the artist has acknowledged how profoundly human beings have been affected by the omnipresence of the machine. Another Davis collage of 1921, Untitled, features a figure made of both simulated and actual collage ele- :r? ?_?. i? . .. ? ? ?. . , r. .?: :' '' pi ! :, ??. Man Ray, Dance, 1915. Collection of Andrew Crispo. ments: a wavy pattern of lines made to feign wood graining-an inevitable allusion to Braque and Picasso- here suggests hair; a shape cut out of wallpaper indicates the torso; the right hand is cut from this torso, and the resulting void signifies the left. The artist selected a circular form, a logo for Gold Seal Congoleum, and glued it strategically on the hip where it functions as the main pivot of the body. Like an axle or gear, it suggests mobility for this faceless automaton. Davis has also begun to exploit the metonymical function of collage. The logo with its promise of "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back" refers to-and satirizes-advertising, a theme further explored by Davis in the Tobacco series and by Dove in The Critic. But, as in ITLKSEZ, the auto- maton-like figure also implicates the world of machine technology. These works affirm that the American avant-garde increasingly conceived of human forms not in traditional terms, as vessels of human sentiment, but as constructs of the mind. In attempting to acknowledge the contem- porary world, Davis rejected subjective sensations or emotions for the human intellect, demanding, "Don't emotionalize. Don't 'feel.'... Instead of 'SENSATIONS' why not symbolize CONCEPTS."9 Accordingly, Davis's figures of this period (and those of Man Ray and Arthur 12</page><page sequence="3">Dove) are invariably expressionless, and in Untitled totally featureless; furthermore, rather than illusionistic- ally modeled, these figures are constructed of flat forms and pasted down elements. As such they can be seen as satires on the traditional rendering of the figure. As Davis wrote, "The question persists as to the use of tin cans, letters, fabric, etc.: for building a satiric figure!" Thus in ITLKSEZ, it is not the title alone, but also Davis's mode of representing the figure, which assumes satiric mean- ing. By proclaiming "architectural structure and satire" to be his primary interests, Davis thus conceived a way of working free from the constraints of traditional figure painting. Instead of acknowledging human subjectivity and emotive faculties, he proposes "building" forms made up of "ideal impersonal units."'0 The satiric irony found in such reactions against the past informed Davis's mode of juxtaposing words and symbols throughout his career. For Davis, as for Arthur Dove, satire was a means of destroying old standards of artistic expression. Satire was not, however, an end in itself; it served to clear the way for a more serious, one might say a more constructive, model of art making. The notion of building a figure, of the work of art as a construction, is invoked not only in the works discussed above, but also in Davis's journal entries of the early 1920s: "A picture becomes a thing of construction like any other thing that is made. Drawing inspiration from whatever source the picture has to be built just like an automobile." A year later he wrote: "A Arthur G. Dove, The Critic, 1925. Collage, 193/4 X 13 2 X 35/8 in. Purchase, with funds from the Historic Art Association of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Mr. and Mrs. Morton L. Janklow, the Howard and Jean Lipman Foundation, Inc., and Hannelore Schulhof. picture is a thing in itself and has to be built out of colored shapes in as certain a way as a mechanic puts an auto- mobile together."" Such statements shed light on how Davis came to terms with the idea of a work of art as a construction. Even though both Untitled and ITLKSEZ feature figurative subjects, their method of production ultimately takes precedence over their human reference. Mimesis and expression have given way to an art of construction in which component parts are assembled, disassembled, and reassembled, an aesthetic mode that engages the world of machine technology. For these American avant-garde artists the machine and the collage aesthetic were thus inextricably linked, and this conflation is crucial to understanding the emer- gence of an indigenous modernism. Whereas the collage technique itself is unmistakably European in origin, the collage and simulated-collage elements Davis used, the Congoleum seal and the black face for instance, allude specifically to American products and entertainment, respectively. Davis took great pains to define collage as a mode of construction similar to mechanical fabrication, and in drawing analogies with the world of engineering, a domain highly valued as characteristically American, he gave the technique an unmistakably American inflec- tion.12 It is worth noting in this context that as a result of the new prominence of engineering the engineer himself attained almost heroic status in American culture, ap- pearing, as Cecelia Tichi has written, "as the hero in over one hundred silent movies and in best-selling novels approaching five million copies in sales between 1897 and 1920." She goes on to refer to the engineer as "the representative man for the era, a symbol of efficiency, stability, functionalism, and power ... a new hero who enacts the values of civilization."'3 By constructing fig- ures so as to personify the attributes so valued in the engineer (rationality, efficiency, and so on), Davis and other modernists thus encoded the engineering values of the day, and in so doing effectively defined themselves as artist-engineers. By equating art making with techno- logical processes these artists were, first of all, attempting to validate art by comparing it to something which was thought highly of in our culture, and secondly, to define art within a specifically American context.14 The collage aesthetic applied to figurative subjects thus provided the artist with a means not only of naturalizing European modernism but of elevating art to a status equal to that of engineering. The defense of art by borrowing authority from other more valued fields such as engineering was only a sec- ondary-and very likely a largely unconscious-motiva- tion. Indeed, more radical aspirations were at work, those of stretching the boundaries of what can be con- sidered art, of validating the new art-making processes of assemblage and collage, and most important, of im- parting value to that part of our surroundings not tradi- tionally deemed relevant as art. The black-faced figure in ITLKSEZ, for instance, suggests, and gives tribute to, black entertainers in such popular diversions as vaudeville and jazz. And as noted above, the inclusion of the Congoleum 13 .......... ... . ... s'.&lt;.7 ............... I S I;:'' I'iI i il'? ...... - ? ???? ??? ?H,- j6" i " ' ? T. ..... ? : .  .

Furthermore, the stance of this figure with its forward-reaching hands suggests a popular Cuban dance of African origin, the conga.'5 Davis's commerce with such popular forms reveals a deeply ingrained anti- elitist impulse manifest in his art throughout his career. These collages thus represent the inauguration of a new and markedly impure aesthetic. In their blurring of high and low culture and in their new mode of picture mak- ing, they are an attempt to match the dynamics of the contemporary environment and to challenge existing criteria for making art. Such goals are of course attributes of Dada; and the elevation of machine technology, ad- vertising, and popular culture in the avant-gardists' fig- urative works of this period is unmistakably Dada in spirit. Davis was by no means a central figure in the New York Dada scene but very much on its fringes. He did not participate in the activities of the Arensberg circle, as did Joseph Stella and Man Ray, nor was he a member of the Societe Anonyme, founded by Katherine Dreier and Marcel Duchamp. However Davis did live in close prox- imity to Man Ray and Duchamp and was a keen observer of Dada. He once singled out Duchamp, for instance, as "not a painter at all but a thinker who expresses himself in unintelligible symbols," and the Dadaists in general as "European Jugglers with whom we have been ac- quainted in vaudeville for some years." Although at times critical of Dada, he also praised it for its repudiation of subjectivity: "Is it possible that the Dadaists are oper- ating on the aesthetic emotion as a surgeon does on a diseased organ?" He goes on to say that it was "now necessary to express tin cans, chicken wire and the Evening Journal which ... have a thickness in the mind."'6 Such privileging of the role of the intellect in artistic creation recalls Duchamp's attempts to place art in an intellectual context. As well, Davis's idiosyncratic use of collage to build alternative figurative images clearly attests to an adoption of Dada principles. In spite of Davis's later protestations to the contrary, as expressed in the 1962 interview excerpted recently in these pages, Davis's works-both in spirit and in content-partici- pated in the essence of Dada.17 Also distinctively Dada is Davis's paradoxical allusion to machine culture as both progressive and primitivistic. This conflation of the technological and the primitive informs works of this period by Man Ray as well as those of Stuart Davis.'8 While the collage aesthetic, as argued Stuart Davis, Untitled, 1921.

Davis thus embraces what can be termed technological primitiv- ism-a primitivism which is at once futuristic and atavis- tic. Viewing Untitled in this context, we are tempted to read the Congoleum logo as an allusion not only to a product of modem technology-a mass-produced floor covering-but also to a "primitive" place-the Congo as source for raw materials, in this case rubber. Through such allusions, Davis has again linked the primitive and the technological. This contradictory impulse implicates Davis as in some measure a Dada conspirator, a techno- logical primitive in an America newly defined in terms of the machine; as well, his works point up the techno- logical primitivism endemic to America itself-an Amer- ica typically characterized as ultra-advanced in technological terms but ultranaive, unsophisticated, everi primitive, in other realms. Such works as ITLKSEZ and Untitled, as well as Mime and The Critic, among other works by Stuart Davis, Man Ray, Arthur Dove, and other modernists, raise questions as to whether this art merely reflects the prevailing technological ethos of the postwar years, or whether it also offers an implicit critique. While these artists could appropriate the machine as a stylistic model, their works are often strongly ambivalent toward the values of tech- nological society.19 On one level the automaton figures in such collages exalt basic principles of mechanical construction, and on another they satirically expose the entire figurative tradition. At the same time, however, they allude ironically to the threats posed by the new machine culture. Because these automata are devoid of human feeling, they are dehumanized; as such, they present a bleak vision of a world controlled by the machine. Like Picabia and Duchamp, the American avant-garde thus embodies the ultimately irreconcilable goals of engaging-indeed embracing-while at the same time resisting the reign of machines.I NOTE S 1.
