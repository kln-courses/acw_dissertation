The meeting was called to order by the Sec- retary, who explained the absence of the President, Prof. S. Wells Williams, as due to illness, consequent upon an accident sustained by him in January last, from the effects of which he was now slowly recovering. No Vice-President being present, the Secre- tary of the Classical Section, Prof. Goodwin, of Cambridge, was called to the chair. After the reading and acceptance of the minutes of the last meeting, reports of the retiring officers were offered. The sum- mary of the year's income and expenses was as follows: RECEIPTS.

The Librarian reported that the additions during the year amount to 47 volumes, 113 parts of volumes, and 52 pamphlets-- chiefly the current exchanges fiom other societies. Those received up to December last were included in the list printed with the Proceedings for October, 1881. The Committee of Publication stated that their expectations expressed a year ago had been realized, the twelfth volume of the Journal having been issued last summer, and the first part of the eleventh volume this spring. Work had not yet been begunl upon the second half of Vol. xi., and it was impossible to say when its completion might be looked for. The Directors announced that they had appointed the autumn cV</page><page sequence="2">Amnerican Oriental Society: meeting to be held in New York in October next, on a day to be designated later by a Committee of Arrangements consisting of Prof. Short, Dr.Ward, and the Corresponding Secretary. Further, they had reappointed the Committee of Publication of last year. They also recommended to the Society the election to membership of the following persons: As Honorary Members- Prof. August Dillmann, of Berlin; Prof. Monier Williams, of Oxford; Mr. Alexander Wylie, of London. As Corporate Members- Rev. S. C. George, of Chambersburg, Pa.; Rev. Lysander Dickerman, of Roxbury, Mass.; Rev. J. P. Peters, of Dresden; Mr. Henry C. Warren, of Boston. The gentlemen thus proposed were elected without dissent. A Nominating Committee, appointed by the Chair, proposed the re-election, without any change, of the Board of Officers of last year, and they were chosen by a unanimous vote. The presiding officer communicated the names of the members deceased since the last annual meeting, and invited remarks upon their merits and achievements. They were: of Corporate Members, Mr. Gilbert Attwood, of Boston; Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, of Concord, Mass.; Rev. Samuel Johnson, of Salem, Mass.; Prof. Theophilus Parsons, of Cambridge, Mass.; and, of Honorary Members, Prof. Theodor Benfey, of Gottingen; Prof. Adalbert Kuhn, of Berlin; Dr. John Muir, of Edinburgh. Some account was given, by the Corresponding Secretary and others, of each one of those whose loss the Society had to deplore. Mr. Attwood was a Boston merchant, whom circumstances had led to take a special interest in the young Japanese visiting this coun- try for purposes of education, who had rendered them signal ser- vices, gratefully acknowledged by them and their patrons, and whose interest in the Orient and in the Oriental Society, testified by him in many ways, had centred about Japan and its institu- tions. Mr. Johnson, lor many years a studious recluse, had devoted himself to the study of the religions of the East, and had produced two volumes, the first of a projected series, one dealing with the beliefs of ancient India, the other with those of China- both highly valued, and republished in England. Prof' Parsons, the noted jurist, deceased in the fullness of advanced age, had been attracted to the work of the Society by his interest in Hindu philosophy.

More particulars were given respecting the lives and works of our deceased foreign members, who all stood in the foremost rank of those who have deserved well of their generation, and of all future time, by their labors in behalf of Oriental knowledge. Extracts were given from the correspondence of the past half- year. Mr. W. W. Rockhill writes from Montreux, Switzerland, en- closing copies of two Mongolian inscriptions, in the Pa-sse-pa character, used during the Yuen dynasty. They were made from a transcription belonging to M. Alphonse Pinart, and have been compared with the other inscriptions heretofore published. They are in a fragmentary condition, and Mr. Rockhill is unable to give a satisfactory account of them. Rev. L. H. Mills writes from Hannover, Germany, reporting satisfactory progress in his work upon the Gathas (described in the Proceedings for May, 1881), and sending as a specimen nearly 300 pages (three quarters) of the first volume, of texts and translations. Prof. Isaac H. Hall, of Philadelphia, excuses himself for being not yet ready with the history of the Arabic Bible version, under- taken by him at the request of the Directors. He reports progress on the MS. Syriac version of the New Testament in his hands, and desires to make a few corrections in his preliminary account of it, given in the Proceedings for October, 1877, as follows: 1.- The statement that there were church lesson notes in the Ambrosian Peshitto ,codex has already been corrected (Proceedings, May, 1879). 2. The paragraph respecting Luke ix. 30, 31 proves to be erroneous, and sliould be cancelled. The place where that passage occurs is one of the most difficult in the whole MS. I read it in Beirft to the best of my ability, and, as I thought, with certainty; but in this country the MS. has had a long drying, and is not only in better preservation than when it left Beirfit, but in most places more legible; hence, I have been enabled to correct this, with some other mis- takes in the reading. The reading of the passage agrees exactly with that of White's edition. I may also state that the change of climate has rendered decipherable some letters written in the ornament at the beginning of Luke. They read: " John the sinner, a monk, wrote [it]." The name John occurs also written in the ornament at the beginning of Mark, and probably refers to the same scribe- not to John Mark. 3. In the paragraph respecting Luke xxiv. 32, the word " Curetonian " should be substituted for "Jerusalem." The error is almost self-correcting to an expert; and I would apologize for it by saying that my books were still on their way across the Atlantic when the communication was written; and the writing was done at a hotel, with scarcely anything to refer to. Only, I had committed the same error in writing to the newspapers from Beirit, and my mind was doubtless running in the old groove. 4. Errors occur in the numbers given in the translations of the subscriptions to the Gospels. They are as follows: a. Subscr. to Matthew, " sections twenty and three" should read "twenty and two;" b. Subscr. to Mark, "miracles twenty and three" should read "miracles twenty and two;" "sections twelve" should read "sections thirteen ;" c. Stibscr. to Luke, " testimonies 72 " should read "tes- timonies 16; and lessons 72 ;" d. Subscr. to John, "miracles nine" should read l" miracles eight." CVll</page><page sequence="4">American Oriental Society: Considering the character of these mistakes, it is best to subjoin a correct table- of the numbers given in the subscriptions: Matthew. Mark.

In the closing words of the subscription to Mark, the words "and for one " should probably read "'and every one." The difference consists in the reading of one letter only. This in Beirut I took to be 'ee ('ain); but in this country it looks more like a kaf. The latter also makes the best sense, in my judgment. These two letters are easily mistaken for each other in the writing of the MSS.; and some would probably agree with my former opinion. Communications were now called for; below are given abstracts of those presented. 1. On Early Trade Routes between Eastern and Western Asia,, by Prof. Howard Osgood, of Rochester, N. Y. Prof. Osgood traced upon the map the principal ancient routes of intercourse between the East and West, and described them and the commerce carried on upon them.* 2. On the Kushites, by Prof. C. H. Toy, of Cambridge, Mass. After a short account of the literature of the subject followed a statement and examination of the ancient testimony as to the geographical position and the character of the Kushites: I. The most trustworthy historical testimony places Kush in Africa, just south of Egypt. So the Egyptians, who gave the name Kash or Kish to this region, and, as far as appears, to no other; and from them, apparently, came thie similar Assyrian usage. This is also the Hebrew use of the term throughout the Old Testament, except in Gemi. x. (and 1 Chron. i. 9, 10) and probably in Gen. ii. (geography of Eden). The Greek geographers employ Ethiopia in the same sense, but sometimes include under it regions lying further west, manifestly not. for ethnological reasons proper, but from external similarity of tribes. For like reasons Herodotus and others apply the name to Asiatic peoples dwelling near the Indus and the Ganges; Pomponius Mela calls these " quodammodo Aethiopes." The ancients seem thus to have given the name really only to the African country south of Egypt. If. On the other hand, certain statements are supposed to show that the terms Kush and Ethiopia embraced the whole region from the Tigris or the Indus to Meroe, along the shore of the Indian Ocean, and that the Kushites were a great civilized and civilizing race. 1. The table of nations, Gen. x., appears beyond doubt to put Kushites in Arabia (Sheba, Dedan) and Mesopotamia (Nimrod). This points to some sort of knowledge or tradition-some acquaintance with tribes bearing similar names, or some belief that there were different peoples in those regions; but not necessa- rily to any correct ethnology. If the opinion was a very old one. the name " Kush " may have been used as loosely as the Greeks used " Ethiopia," for all remote southern countries. If it was comparatively modern (and there are strong reasons for referring the genealogical table to the period of the Exile), the author may have assigned these regions to Kush as the nearest of the sons of Ham, to whom alone, of the three sons of Noah, they could, in his opinion, belong.. 2.

(Susiana), India, Palestine, and Arabia. Most of these are not found earlier than in the time of Herodotus, and have little or no ethnological value. The wildness with which they were invented and employed is illustrated by their explanations -of the origin and history of the Jews (cited by Movers, Phcen. ii. 1, 23). The name " Ethiopia " in these stories is a loose geographical designation, absolutely without ethnological significance; it includes peoples, such as the tribes of northern India and of Syria, that we know to be of different races. The name Kephenes, therefore, by which the Chaldeans are said to have been formerly called (Hellani- cus), and by which the Egyptians called the Phenicians (Kefa), is not to be re- garded as African Kushite because Kepheus is represented as king of Ethiopia, for Ethiopia need mean nothing more than southern Babylonia or southern Palestine (Joppa). 3. The alleged historical facts are not more conclusive. The name of the Ktaoiot or Kotaaaot of Susiana, the Kashshi of the Assyrian inscriptions, re- sembles Kish, Kash. Kush; but the resemblance may well be purely accidental, or non-ethnological. The name Puna, belonging to a people living in the Kash region south of Egypt, has been compared with Punici, Pceni, Phoinix; but it has little resemblance to the last, and nothing that we know of the Phenicians con- nects them with the Puna. III. Against the hypothesis of an Asiatic Kush are some strong positive grounds. 1. Supposing the old African Kuish to be represented by the modern Beja, Galla, Somali (as is generally agreed), there is no trace of their language in Asia, either in Arabia (Himyaritic), or in Mesopotamia (Sumerian-Accadian), or elsewhere; the " Kushite " element is a pure fancy. 2. They had no civilization of their own, according to the best information concerning them; and the suppo- sition of a Kushite civilization in Arabia, formerly held firmly by eminent scholars, would now find no advocates. But it is alleged that they were the bearers of Egyptian culture eastward; that the ancient civilization of Babylonia was bor- rowed from Egypt. A comparison of the two civilizations will show, however, that neither could have been borrowed from the other. They were products of the same period of the world, and of sister-races, but each went its independent way; we can no more speak of borrowing between them than between the languages of the two peoples. 3. There seems to have been no time when Afri- can Kushites could have carried civilization eastward. They were themselves barbarians up to B. 0. 3000 at earliest, and were not imbued with Egyptian cul- ture before B. C. 2000, when a flourishing civilization had already existed for cen- turies in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates. It appears, therefore, that the name Kush belongs properly only to the region lying just sotuth of Egypt. The languages of the group of tribes represented by the Saho and Beja may with probable correctness be called Kushite or Kushic, but otherwise the term seems to have no scientific value. 3. The Cosrnogonic Hymn, Rig-Veda X. 129, by Prof. W. D. Whitney, of New Haven. The prevailing belief of the Hindus of the Vedic period as to the origin of the world is that it was made by the gods. They have no detailed and gener- ally accepted theory of the creation, and, in the absence of a supreme divinity in their Pantheon, and the lack of consistent system among their beliefs, now one and now another of their gods is credited with the production of heaven and earth, of men and animals, and even of the other gods themselves. Here and there, however, are found signs of more advanced thought on these subjects, be- ginnings of the speculations which rise to greater and greater importance in the Brahmanas. the Upanishads, and the philosophical systems. The most interesting of these, and the most noted, is a hymn in the tenth or supplementary book of the Rig-Veda, evidently to be reckoned among the most modern constituents of that great collection. It has been repeatedly translated, or more or less loosely para- phrased, and accompanied with laudatory comments, often of a greatly exagger- ated character. Hence a simple version and brief exposition may seem not super- fluous. The point of view of the author of the hymn is given most plainly in the two -concluding verses, which, in the metre of the original, run thus: cix</page><page sequence="6">American Oriental Society: 6. Who truly knoweth ? Who can here proclaim it ? Whence hither born, whence cometh this creation ? Hitherward are the gods from its creating; Who knoweth, then, from whence it came to being ? 7. This creation-from whence it came to being, Whether it made itself, or whether not- Who is its overseer in highest heaven. He surely knoweth : or if he does not know ? One or two points here are questionable. In 6 c, we have the instrumental instead of the more regular ablative; hence Ludwig translates: "the gods have arrived hither by the sending of this one " (the pronoun, namely, may be mascu- line as well as neuter; it is not feminine, referring directly to visrsti, ' creation '). But the denial of prior existence to the gods, which is the main point. comes from either interpretation. Again, in 7 b, the subject and meaning of the verb dadhe are unclear; it must be either 'it set (or made) itself,' or ' he set (or made) it for himself:' i. e. the "overseer" of the next line. I have thought the former more acceptable; but whether the middle can have so pregnantly reflexive a sense admits of doubt. To the apprehension of the poet, as is seen, the gods themselves are only a part of the present order of things, and their existence to be accounted for along with the rest, while no competent knowledge of its origination is to be expected from them. He rejects the old faith and its simple solution of the problem; to be sure, he has not so cast it out of his mind as to deny the existence of a general manager of the universe, located in the old heaven, but even his power to satisfy our curiosity is questioned. The rest of the hymn is the poet's own solution. which, after all, he is not afraid to venture to put forth, drawn from the depths of his consciousness. In the first verse and a half, then, he attempts to depict the chaos negatively, by telling what was not then in existence. And he commits the rhetorical fault of beginning with a denial so absolute that what follows in the way of detail can only dilute it and weaken its force. Thus: 1. "Not the non-existent existed, nor did the existent exist, at that time:" i. e. in that indefinable past which preceded the present order of things there was neither existence nor non-existence. Surely, then, there can be nothing more to say about it; yet he goes on: * not the room of air existed, nor the firmament that,is beyond." Then follows in the second line a series of questions (not entirely clear, since kim may either mean ' what ' or be mere interrogative particle): " what enveloped ? where ? in whose protection? what was the ocean, the abyss profound?" The next verse pro- ceeds: 2. ' Not death existed, nor what is immortal, then "-a very unnecessary amplification; since if there was, as already declared, neither existence nor even non-existence, there evidently could occur no cessation of existence, nor could there be anything that prolonged an existence without cessation. Finally, " there was no distinction of night from day;" and so the negative description ends with a mere denial of the existence of light-a conception that is further enlarged upon in the fourth verse. Now comes something positive; and it appears that there was in existence, after all, a certain indefinite It, or That, or This (for tad might mean any one of the three: probably "It" is our best rendering): "Breathed, without wind, by inner power, It only; than It, truly, nothing whatever else existed besides." Of course, if there is a tad, the attribute of existence cannot be denied it: and the poet by this time is content merely to assert that nothing except this existed (dsa: the verb is the same with that used at the becginning of the first verse). He deludes himself with the belief that by first denying absolutely everything, and then denying all but an indefinable something, he has bridged over the abyss between non-existence and existence, and given a start to the development of the uniyerse. And he anthropomorphizes his ' It " by making it breathe, as if a living being; though he adds, by way of saving clause, that such breathing occasioned no perceptible motion of air. The third verse is in good part a repetition of the second, in slightly different terms. It reads thus, 3. "Darkness existed, hidden by darkness, at the begin-- cx</page><page sequence="7">Proceedings at Boston, May, 1882. ning; an undistinguished sea was this all; the void that was covered with empti- ness-that alone was born by the might of fervor." The first half-verse presents a familiar and widely-spread conception; an unillumined ocean is one of the most naturally suggested figures for the Chaos; but its inconsistency with the first verse is manifest. " A void covered (literally, as a vessel is covered with its lid) with emptiness" is a not particularly unsuccessful attempt to express the inconceivable; about as good as the old popular definition of Chaos, " a grest pile of nothing, and nowhere to put it." Whether " fervor" (tapas)., in the last quarter-verse, means physical heat or devotional ardor, penance. according to the later prevalent mean- ing of the word, admits of a question; but it is doubtless to be understood in the latter sense. For no such physical element as heat plays any part in the Hindu cosmogonies, while penance, the practice of religious austerities, is a con- stant factor in their theories. In the stories of their Brahmanas, it is told times innumerable how the Creater, desiring to accomplish or attain something, per- formed penance (tapo 'tapyata), and so succeeded. It is a grossly anthropomorphic trait; yet hardly more so than that with which the next verse begins: 4. *" Desire arose in the beginning upon It, which was the first seed of mind (thought, inten- tion)." That is, since desire precedes and leads to action in man, it must have done so in the creation likewise; so 'kdmayata, 'he felt desire,' is the introduc- tion to most of the acts of Prajapati, the Creator, in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. The remaining line of the verse is obscure: "The sages (or poets), by devotion, found the tie of the existent in the non-existent, seeking it in the heart." The verb here is in the same tense with those used in describing the processes of creation above; and so the verse seems to project, without any preparation, certain wise persons into the midst of the nonentity or its development; if something later, within our period, were intended, the tense should be the aorist. And wherever sat and asat, 'existence and non-existence,' are brought together, it is a mere juggle of words, an affectation of profundity. But the next verse is still more unintelligible; no one has ever succeeded in putting any sense into it, and it seems so unconnected with the rest of the hymn that its absence is heartily to be wished. A mechanical translation runs as fol- lows: 5. " Crosswise [was] stretched out the ray (line) of them: was it forsooth below? was it forsooth above ? impregnators were, greatnesses were; stadhd below, offering beyond." The word rendered ' offering' is literally ' forth-reach- ing,' and has sometimes also, as perhaps here, the signification ' straining, intent- ness;' which of its senses svadhk has in the line, I have not ventured to determine. Who the ' they ' are, unless the sages of the preceding verse, it is hard to guess. The second quarter-verse gives an indication of lateness, much more important than any other in the hymn; it has protraction (pluti) of the final syllable of each of the two clauses, signifying a balancing of the mind between two alternatives (mimdhsd). There is no other case of it in the Rig-Veda; but half-a-dozen occur in the Atharvan, and it is by no means uncommon in the Brahmanas. The general character and value of the hymn are very clear. It is of the highest historical interest as the earliest known beginning of such speculation in India, or probably anywhere among Indo-European races. The attitude of its author and the audacity of his attempt are exceedingly noteworthy. But nothing is to be said in absolute commendation of the success of the attempt. On the contrary, it exhibits the characteristic weaknesses of all Hindu theosophy; a disposition to deal with words as if they were things, to put forth paradox and insoluble contra- diction as profundity, and to get rid of anthropomorphic divinities by attributing an anthropomorphic personality to the universe itself. The unlimited praises which have been bestowed upon it, as philosophy and as poetry, are well-nigh nauseating. At this point the Society took an hour's recess, and on assem- bling again, Prof. Abbot of Cambridge in the chair, continued to listen to communications. 4. A Royal Leper, by Rev. Wm. Butler, Missionary in India. Dr. Butler gave an interesting description of a durbar, held by the Viceroy of India near Delhi, in 1859, of which he was himself a witness. Its object was to cxi</page><page sequence="8">American Orienital Society: honor the Maharaja of Rewah for his faithfulness to the British cause during the mutiny, and his kind hospitality and effective protection extended to English fugi- tives from the massacres, and to decorate him with the grand cross of a Com- mander of the Star of India. The Raja was himself a leper, as had been his ancestors for several generations, in spite of the devotion of one of them, who solemnly sacrificed himself in the Ganges, under the promise of the priests that it would extinguish the curse resting on his line. 5. On the doctrine of God and the Soul among the most ancient Nile-dwellers, by Prof. T. 0. Paine, of Elmwood, Mass. The word dmun means 'hidden,' in the hieroglyphic text of the Book of the Dead (Todt.). When followed by the figure of God, the word is a name of God, and means 'the Hidden One.' The word rd means 'the Sun;' and, when fol- lowed by the determinative for God, it means God as the Sun. The two terms together, Amun Ra. do not mean ' the Hidden Sun,' but ' the Hidden One of the Sun.' On the cartonnage of Anchapi (dnX hapi), in the Rochester Museum, that lady is called Osiris en Hapi Anch, and also Osiris Anch Hapi: the transposition is merely ornamental; but the insertion of en, 'of,' is of great importance-it is almost always omitted. We thus have Amun en Ra, ' The Hidden One of the Sun.' Compare " Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment" (Ps. civ. 2), and "His face did shine as the sun" (Mat. xvii. 2); also Rev. i. 16; x. 1; xii. 1; xix. 17; xxi. 23; xxii. 5. Add, Book of the Dead, 163. 9: " Oh Hidden One (God), The [Pa] Man [ka], Existing [zeperr] (God, nuter)." "(God)" represents the picture of God-the determinative. "Hidden One" is dmun. Thus God is conceived of as "The Man," and as the One who "Exists," who "Is," but who is "Hidden" from human sight, as pictured bv a screen covering a man like an umbrella (ibid. 153. 4). Amun Ra is hence The Sun-Hidden God-God as a Self-Existing, Divine Man. inside of the Sun, and covered by it. This also is a name of God in the Future world. The Blessed Spirit (ma Xer), after death. says: " I am a [as a] pure lily springing up in the meadow of God "-of Ra, the Sun, inside of which is God: a picture of the Sun (rd) is here followed by a picture of God in human form (ibid. 81. 2). In the La Trouvaille de Deir-el-Bahari, loaned to Prof. Paine by the Rochester Museum, Queen Makeri's body " is joined to its everlasting (t'et) place; united to its dwelling for ever (neh)-the beautiful burial of the Hidden One of Thebes" (PI. 13). With this put: "I am living a second time after death" (Todt. 38. 4); "I shall not die a second time in Khernuter" (44. 4); " His soul liveth for ever (neh); he dieth not a second time" (153. 9). Hence the embalmed body remained in the earth (ta) for ever (neh), while the departed man-soul lived in the future world for ever (neh). Prof. Paine spoke of a late paper before the Harvard Biblical Club, in which he exhibited a picture of the soul as in a spiritual body painted blue, firmly erect, while the body of flesh, painted earth color, was in the act of dropping to the ground. 6. On M. de Harlez's Avesta, by Prof: J. Luquiens, of Auburn- dale, Mass. The complete French version of the Avesta by the well-known Belgian scholar, Mgr. de Harlez, which has just appeared in a revised form (Bibliotheque Orientale, vol. V., Paris, 1881), and provided with an almost encyclopedical introduction, is a work of too great a scope not to deserve more than a passing recognition. Like Spiegel, his immediate predecessor, M. de Harlez seems to have aimed at reconciling the data of Eastern comments and of linguistic comparison; and, their methods being similar, their works could not differ essentially. Still, in Avestan matters. harmony does not reach very far, and leaves a wide scope to originality or divergency. M. de Harlez's stamp is clearly imprinted in all his pages; less in his many suggestions or corrections of detail than in his readiness to discuss, and fairness in reporting, divergent opinions, and in the very ruggedness of many passages which, out of sturdy adherence to his positions, he has disdained to exii</page><page sequence="9">Proceedings at Boston, May, 1882. smooth off: indeed, scientific honesty marks out his translation among far more brilliant works. It is to the method, however, that we would fain look for indications of a progress; though it is there, perhaps, that their want is most felt. Not but that we might point out in the author's renderings and in his notes a growing distrust of tradition. Even in his preface he asserts that his translation rests before all "upon the comparative study of the text:" which is in itself a declaration of rights. There is certainly in the texts an element of evidence which often is self- sufficient; the roots are not from an unknown stock; they bear upon their faces the familiar Indo-European stamp: oftentimes the far more definite Aryan and Vedic type is so visible that little is wanting to get at the intrinsic value of a form. It is held, then, that by pursuing the course of a root through all its meanderings in the Avesta an adequate idea of cognate words would be gained; and the more so, since the two extreme terms of the process are well set in light: namely, the root on the one side, the traditional rendering on the other; but it soon appears that M. de Harlez's conception of " a comparative study of the text " stops far short of the process just outlined, and amounts in the main only to so modifying in this or that way the specific mean4ng furnished by the native comments as to make it fit the several texts. Let us take as an instance the word draona, found all through the many strata of the Avesta. The Parsi tradition hands to M. de Harlez the sense ' consecrated wafer, small loaf used in sacrificial offerings;' and on this basis he establishes his comparative study: in Vendidad xiii. 129, the word must mean both simple 'bread' and 'altar-bread,' and that in the same breath, through a very unlikely play of words; in Yaqna xi., it is no longer 'bread' in any form, but an offering ,of meat; and again, in Yacna xxxiii. 8, it is neither bread nor meat. but ' offer- ing,' in the palest sense that term ever had. And for this chasse-croise of mean- ings no voucher is adduced; for there can be no question of any peculiar fitness when we are thus led to the very singular prescription of Yasht xix. 7, that ' tout le temps que (qiielqu'un) gravit des montagnes, que tout ce temps il jette en mor- ceaux un draona " (the loaf in question, of the size of a dollar) etc.; or to the very odd statement that the dog and the priest are alike, for both are "a petit pain." Yet the etymological clue was near at hand; the word can -be connected with either of two Avestan roots only: one dru, 'run,' the other dru, 'be firm;' and between the ideas of ' course ' and of ' stability' no hesitation is permitted. The oldest instance of our word is namely in one of the hymns, Yagna xxxiii. 8, in which the singer asks "for the lasting gifts of long-life (amertdt) and for the sta- bility (draono) of health," a fitness confirmed by the fact that another word of the same root (drvatd.t) came in the course of time to mean 'health,' too. From the abstract sense 'rest, stability,' to the concrete one 'thing fixed, laid apart for offering,' the step is easy. and nothing more is needed for an adequate rendering of all the passages concerned. It is in the old hymns, however, in thle Gathas, that the inadequacy of M. de Harlez's method is most felt: not that his rendering of them is obscure; but, like. Spiegel's, it is colorless, wanting in edges and reliefs; the words follow in good order, but with a sameness which leaves no hold for either ear or eye. It is easy enough to put the fitiger on the fault: the presence of many x and y quantities, which tradition at bay clothed with so abstract or inac- curate a meaning as to make them inert obstructions in the drift of thought. The word qdthra, for instance, one of the large and dubious family of "light-words," and a factor of some moment in the older Avesta, is rendered 'brightness, bril- liancy' by our writer, though he varies from this notion into that of 'glory' (Y. 1. 5), and even 'felicity' (Y. xxviii. 2); in the several passages the word is a lifeless burden, except perhaps in Y. xxxi. 7, thus translated: ' Celui qui a formd a l'origine ces eclats lumineux (qathra) pourqnuils se repandent dans les astres (raocebis), celui-la a cree par son intelligence la puretd par laquelle il soutient le bon esprit,' etc.; the sense is plausible, but the speciousness of the wording only disguises the fact that if qdthrd is 'brilliancy of light,' so is undoubtedly the word rendered 'astres,' raocde; and the process of giving 'luminous brilliancy' to the lights' is not unlike that of carrying coals to Newcastle. In truth the frequent word raocdo, 'lights,' is never accompanied by any 'luminous' epithets, but gen- erally-and this is an important clue-by the adjectives anaghra, ' without com- mencement,' and qadhdta, ' self-ruled' (or rather, by the natural transition from exiii CXlll</page><page sequence="10">American Oriental Society: selfness to sameness, 'never-changing, everlasting'); this notion, a favorite one- in the religion of the Divine Order, is usually added to a word by the pronominal affix qa (sva), and qdthra is probably another immediate exponent of it. Our pas- sage might then mean: 'He who in the beginning planned (with) for the heavenly lights that they should be clothed with lasting (self-ruled) motion, planned also- the Divine Order (asha), for the purpose of establishing firmly the law of kind- ness; therefore thou must be thought (?) in mind, 0 Mazda, as ever the same.' It is feasible, then, through a revision of the text in the light of comparison, to- give many passages a relief they have not in current versions; whether our con- ception of Mazdeism will be materially changed thereby is a question which may remain open until the revision has been carried out on a large scale. The inter- preter of the Avesta must remember, in any event, that tradition was formed on, but also out of, the ruins of Mazdeism, through a natural, though to us unknown, process.- As this respect for the filiation of Mazdeism is a marked merit of the- school to which M. de Harlez belongs, we can readily admit that, in broad lines, he has read Mazdeism correctly out of the texts, and that his tenacious advocacy of the spontaneity of that religion as against the evolution-theory is to be reck- oned an eminent service to' Avestan studies. This does not imply that he is averse to theorizing, nor even to theorizing with a broad sweep. When, for instance, he strives to specify, with a degree of closeness not claimed by any previous theory, the place, date, and mode of birth of Mazdeism, ho treads upon purely speculative ground. In his introduction, namely, though more fully in a work often quoted there, les Origines du Zoroastrisme, he ascribes the genesis of Mazdeism to an influx of Jewish ideas, coinciding with the captivity of the tribes of Israel in Assyria and Media, under Salmanasar. This view is not lacking in plausibility: if Jehovism, more intense from its defeat, ever met face to face, and at close quarters, dying naturalism, the outcome cannot be a question of doubt. The argument, as drawn in the Origines, rests chiefly upon the presumable similarity of certain tenets common to both religions. "The four principal and characteristic features of Mazdeism," he says (Orig.. p. 296), ' are monotheism, creation ex nihilo, prophetism, and moral dualism." The list has certainly a Judaic sound, and as long as his argument tends to prove that the Jews cannot have borrowed it, it progresses smoothly enough: but from this easy victory it does not follow so clearly that the Iranians borrowed from the Jews: not eveu though M. Renan, triumphantly quoted by our writer, should say that "here the problem is reduced to knowing which nation preceded the other." In reality, these "features" are characteristic of Mazdeism in M. de Harlez's theory only, not in his version, where one might look in vain for traces of prophetism or creation ex nihilo. As to moral dualism, it is there, but not indeed as in Judaism, where it timidly stands on the outer edge of the system, and in a book of doubtful date; in Mazdeism it takes the foreground, and even in the earliest time pervades every stratum of thought or langeage; its tone is clear, almost aggressive; one might call it a national almost as much as a religious feature; and if the specious dilemma sug- gested by M. Renan is unavoidable, we should be compelled, on this point at least, to grant Mazdeism priority of possession. It is not so with monotheism; the very name, if used in Mazdeic theology, must at the outset be encircled with a close net of qualifications, lest the Avestan texts should turn out exegetic pitfalls. One can not deny, however, that out of several conflicting factors monotheism stood for a moment uppermost in Iran: not the full. conscious, jealous one-God-doctrine, but rather enshrouded by the last reflections of nituralism and the rising rays of dualistic conceptions; this admiission leaves the problem unsolved; distant likeness. proves nothing when the angles and lines in no point coincide; and no such coin- cidence is claimed. M. de Harlez suggests (Introd. ccv.) that the Magi did not aim at imitating, but built out of their plunder an edifice sui generis: but this is taking the very ground from under the argument: for if the Magi so well dis- guised their loans, one can no longer plead the striking likeness of the dogmas. In truth, syncretism of this kind is a philosophical phenomenon of effete times and great centres; it rises on the ruins, not on the pedestal, of national pride; and wlienever it appeared, no hmuan hand was ever so guarded. no mind so- transcendent, but that here and there a word, an image, slipped in that betrayed its exotic origin. M. de Harlez refuses to the early Iranians that degree of culture needed for the setting-up of a religion, as if culture and religiousness went cxiv</page><page sequence="11">Proceedings at Boston, May, 1882. abreast; and yet he ascribes to them a feat which implies a mental and literary skill such as no nation of those times could boast. If, however, we eliminate from his theory the part assigned to the Jews, that allotted to the Medes must follow, and the gates of time and space are opened wide again for the history and genesis oF fire-worship. Yet as the role of the Magi in Mazdeism involves another argument, it ought to be considered in the light of its own merits. Both native and classical tradition agree in clothing the Median tribe of the Magi with religious authority in Mazdean worship; but as both stop very far from even the earliest historical times, it is unwarrantable to suppose that that status existed from the beginning. The testimony of the texts is for early times far more trustworthy than tradition; it is chiefly negative, to be sure, but it is unbiassed, and reaches to the very farthest point of time from which we may hope to hear. Taken strictly, it proves beyond a doubt that neither Medes nor Persians had a hand in the composition of the Avesta; the language of the latter is differ- ent from that of the Persians to a certainty; from that of the Medes too, if we take for a basis of comparison a few Medic words that have been transmitted to us. Medes and Persians are equally, as distinct nations, unknown to the writers, who exult in the name of Aryans only. Nothing indicates that the Magi had any birthright among believers, or that priestly orders were in the possession of any family or tribe; M. de Harlez sees the name of the Magi in a puzzling word (moghiu) twice found in the later A vesta-as if the ambitious tribe of the Medes could have deemed its pride satisfied with two dubious allusions. No nation sets about composing books of the nature of the Avesta for a literary pastime, care- fully avoiding to affix its mark or sign; and it is incredible that the writers of those books, if composed at a time when the two great empires of Persia and Media, not to mention the Assyrians, were waging terrific wars for supremacy. could so hush down their feelings as not to drop a single word bearing the burden of their national pride or antipathies; there were opportunities for this such as would tempt even the dullest patriot; indeed, after the numbering of Mazdean cities and lands, in the 1 st chapter of the Vendidad, after the words '" There are yet other places, other lands," etc., the Pehlevi trantslator, wondering at the silence of the Avestan writer, could not but add 'such as Persia, etc.' Think of the greatest realm in the East being indebted for a mere mention to the late hand of a Sassanid Parthian I Again, the language of the Avesta denotes a location in the centre of an un- mixed Iranian race; everything is Aryan, from the name of the earth to that of the gods, not excepting hostile gods; not a syllable is there to suggest the prox- imity of any but kith and kin, until we reach the very latest strata of Mazdeic writing-which could not happen in the midst of the Sumerian or Scythian tribes of Media. The most telling argument, however, which M. de Elarlez with his wonted fairness reproduces in all its force, is this: among the antagonists of the Mazdean apostle are the Kavis and the Ufikhs-that is, tihe singers and sacrificers with whose names the Vedas have made us familiar; "this coincidence is strange," adds M. de lHarlez; it is, indeed, passing strange. and decisive as to the time as well as to the location of the older Avesta. Mazdeism was born on ground distinctively Iranian, remote from utn-Aryan influences, and yet within reach of Vedism, though it be one of its farthest ramifications; this ground we may not be able to fix more definitely, but it was not Western Iran. It must be added that our writer, anticipating these objections, props his main theory with other incidental ones: as, that the older parts of the Avesta were written by the Magi in their western settlements, near Mouru (Merv); but this hypothesis, which assumes the existence of two, nay, three different dialects successively spoken by the Magi, is supported neither by tradition nor by the texts. So long, indeed, as the testimony of historical times is made to go abreast with that of the Avesta, there will exist a hopeless conflict between these two sources of information. The conflict is allayed, however, if, instead of being juxtaposed, they are superposed. Tihe ascendant thread of history breaks when we reach the great contest between Medes and Persians, but it is taken up by the Avesta (barring such timid additions as we may ascribe to later writers) a little before the rise of Media, and follows, though not perhaps unbrokenly, to times not far remote from thle Vedic period. It is better to admit these breaks in the annals of the Iranians than to assume a theory which neither offers the time needed for the cxv</page><page sequence="12">American Oriental Society: long fluctuations of the Mazdeic dogma, nor even satisfactorily accounts for its status at the dawn of Persian history. It remains, in truth, to explain how Mazdeism born in Media is found exercising its sway in Persia as early as in Darius's time; it does not stand to reason that the religion of the vanquished should have easily become that of the conqueror. Both de Harlez and Darmesteter (the latter more fully in his Introd. to the Ven- didad) lay great stress on that part of Persian history which culminated in the death of the false Smerdis and the elevation of Darius to the throne; they infer, namely, that Mazdeism (or rather Magism) was just then making headway in Persia, and that the Achaemenids' attitude was that of spirited patriots, who descry under religious encroachments the incoming danger of foreign usurpation. This is very plausible, but the contrary is plausible also; for there is not one of the Achemenidan inscriptions but breathes the purest Mazdeic spirit, while the role of the Magi is so problematic that -other recent writers maintain that it was the Persians who upheld the faith and that the Magi were its adversaries (Oppert). Both writers make also too much of the fact reported by Herodotus, that the Magi exposed their dead as prescribed in the Vendidad, while the Persians buried theirs. It is taking very narrow ground to set up as a shibboleth of Mazdeic or- thodoxy a practice which was neither distinctively Iranian (since it was also current among Scythian tribes in several regions) nor generally adopted among Mazdean followers, as we know from the first chapter of the Vendidad. For those who believe that Mazdeism was born in the East in times far anterior to the Medic sway, and brought westward by successive migration, that its growth was slow. fluctuating according to places, times, and new influxes of ideas, they have no difficulty in admitting that what was law in one place was possibly heresy in another; but there is a more positive argument to adduce: namely, that only ages of adhesion on the part of the Persian people to Mazdeism can account for its moral status, instanced by very early documents; for if theological consistency is not a feature of Mazdeism, if even in the old hymns monotheism, dualism, and a sort of abstract polytheism elbow each other, getting successively the upper hand according as the wind blew or the writer leaned, there is no variation as to the ground-work of the faith, the healthy, pure, uncompromising principles of conduct, Iranian ethics. M. de Harlez devotes an interesting chapter of his Introduction to Avestan morals, quoting among others the testimony of the Greek writers in favor of the probity and veracity of the Persians; but a witness even more for- cible speaks to us from the height of the Behistun rock, namely Darius, son of Hystaspes: " I have not been wicked nor a liar; I liave not connived with crime, neither I nor my family; I governed in agreement with the law; I committed no violence against the just or against the virtuous I" Have we not here the best historical comment, sealed by a royal hand, on the precepts ever dear to the believers in the Divine Order, truth and humanity ? We might now ask of M. de Harlez, or any writer who denies to the Persians the heir-loom of Mazdeism, how many months-or, if this be deemed trifling, how many years are reckoned neces- sary for a system of morals to imbue the life of a nation from the laws to the personal principles of conduct, to pervade all classes from the king to the com- moners: and upon the answer to this rests the question of the previous standing of Mazdeism among Persians. 7. On the Rude Tribes of Northeastern India, by Prof. J. Avery, of Brunswick, Me. The old province of Assam, which was coterminous witll the valley of the Brah- maputra, is bordered on three sides by a rugged mountain tract, which has been, in most cases from time immemorial, the home of numerous savage tribes. The great diversity of speech among these tribes, and the primitive manners and cus- toms which. they have stubbornly retained in spite of Aryan civilization, present an interesting, but as yet little-worked, field for the linguist and anthropologist. Begin,ning in the extreme east of the province, we find the settlements of the Khamtis and Singphos, the most intelligent of the Hill tribes. The former are a branch of the Shan race, and came into Assam from Burmah in the last century. The Singphos, who are allied to the rude tribes of northern Burmah, reached their present abodes at about the same time. cxvi</page><page sequence="13">Proceedings at Boston, May, 1882. Following the border-land northward, we come first to the Mishmis. whose villages extend from the Namlang, a branch of the Irawaddy, to the Digam, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, or approximately between 96?-97? 30' E long. and 27? 40'-280 40' N. lat. Next to the Mishmis, and between the Digam aund Dibang rivers, is found an allied tribe calling themselves Midhis, but known to the Assamese as Crop-haired Mishmis. These two tribes are very savage, and are known only from the scanty accounts of a few venturesome travellers and occasional visits to the Assam markets. West of the Dibang a line of tribes stretches along the foot-hills of the Hima- layas as far as the confines of Bhutan. In order of location they are the Abars or Padam, Hill Miris, Daphlas, and Akas. As we approach Bhutan, the tribes show an increasing likeness to the Tibetans in features and customs. Returning to south-eastern Assam, we first enter the extensive territory of the Naga people, who are said to number not less than thirty tribes, and whose villages are found as far west as the Doyang river, or between 93? and 97? E. long. The Nagas are the most savage of all the mountain tribes, and their country has never been completely explored. Adjoining the Nagas on the-west are the Mikirs and Kukis, the latter being immigrants from a large and powerful tribe lying farther south in Manipur and Kachar. The remaining border land is occupied by the Jaintias or Syntengs, the Khasias, and the Garos. These tribes probably represent the true aborigines of Assam, and have preserved marked traces of affinity to a similar population in Central India. The rude tribes. whose location we have hastily traced, differ considerably in details of physical appearance and customs, but have certain characteristics in common, only one or two of which can be noted in this abstract. Physically, they exhibit in a marked degree the type called Mongoloid-the oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, square jaws, scanty beard, and color varying from tawny yellow to dark brown. They live in long, narrow houses, one end of which is usually supported upon posts, so as to secure in their rough country a level floor with the least trouble. Many families and even a whole village some- times crowd inlto one of these houses. Their skill in the arts is very limited. not all of the tribes being able to make iron implements or weave their own clothiug. They practice the rude sort of agriculture known all over India as jhum. Each tribe is usually divided into clans, at the head of which are hereditary chiefs, whose authority is in some cases real, in others merely nominal. In the latter case the fear of private revenge is the only restraint to crime. The Abars are governed by a council of elders, who daily convene in the morang or town hall, and regulate the affairs of the community even to the details of daily labor. The religion of all the tribes except the Khamtis, who have embraced Buddhism, is at a rude, animistic stage. and consists chiefly in propitiating the mischievous spirits of their forests by offerings of tfowls and other animals. Divination and magic are universally practiced. Traces of Aryan influence can be detected in some of their ideas of a future life. The languages of these tribes have never been carefully studied, and with exception of a grammar of Garo, a grammar and dictionary of Khasia, and a few other missionary publications, are known only by brief vocabu- laries. Any classificatiofi is therefore provisional. The Khamti is located with the Siamese in the Tai group; the Khasia and Jaintia form a group by themselves at present; and the other languages, or (dialects. as shall appear hereafter, not less than two score in number, are classed with the Tibeto-Burman suib-family. The prevailing type of all these languages is monosyllabic with a tendency to agglu- tination. 8. Specimen of a List of Verbs, intended as a Supplement to his Sanskiit Giammar, by Prof. Whitney. Prof. Whitney said that, in the present condition of Sanskrit grammar and lexicography, an account, as full as our knowledge permits, of the verbal roots of the language, with the verb-forms made from them. and their immediate or primary derivatives, cannot be considered otherwise than timely and desirable. The Sanskrit grammars of Williams and MUller, indeed, include something of this character; but it makes no pretense to completeness, and moreover takes as its basis the native grammarians. giving what these have laid down as approved for use, rather than what actually finids place in the literary records of the language. cXVll</page><page sequence="14">American Oriental Society: Prof. Whitney has been for some time past engaged in preparing such an ac. count, and he now brought a specimen, and laid it before the Society, with some account of the method followed, hoping to elicit criticism and suggestions of im- provement. The proposed plan is to give under each authenticable root all the formations from it which are thus far quotable from any part of the literature, ancient or modern, with the period of their appearance. Of course. the information on which such a statement can be founded is in the main that given in the great Petersburg Lexicon, supplemented by Bohtlingk's briefer dictionary, now in pro- cess of publication. But a great deal of independent work has also been done by the author, in the way of revising and extending the collections represented by the Lexicon. Such work must long remain incomplete, and a List like that contemplated cannot but be, at its first publication, of a provisional character, an assembling and arranging of a body of material for constant correction and addi- tions, according to the opportunities of every scholar. As regards the chronological periods to be recognized in the history of the language, it is intended to distinguish the Veda (by the sign v), the Brahmanas (by B), the Sfitras (by s). and the Upanishads, where necessary (by u); then the epic language, of Mahabharata and Ramayana, which has has not been brought under absolute subjection to the rules of the grammarians, needs to be held apart (by E) from the grammatically correct or classical tongue (denoted by c). There is unques- tionably a certain rudeness in this classification-and especially, when all mantra- material shall have been gathered from sahihitf and brahmana and sutra, and properly arranged and examined, it will be possible to establish a mantra-division; but at present nothing better than what is here proposed appears to be within reach. The special works of each class may be referred to wherever there appears to be occasion for it; and in particular, much that belongs to the Rig-Veda alone will require to be so marked. Forms authorized by the grammarians, but not met with in use, may sometimes be added in brackets. The modes of formation of the present-system are marked according to the order followed in the author's grammar, the conjugation class-number of the Hindu grammar being added in brackets. The numbering of the aorist-formations is according to the former authority only. The form given as specimen of a tense-system is regularly in the third person; but if only isolated forms are met with, they are set down as they occur. Among the primary derivatives, it is best to put not only those really deserving the name. but also those whlich, though properly secondary, have won in the history of the language the position and value of primary words. Such are especially the gerundives in ya, tavya, and aniya, with the words in aka and uka and in etc. Formations by primary suffixes from secondary conjugation-stems are put last.

It is hoped that the List will be published within a year. 9. Further Studies amoulg the Metres of the Rig-Veda, by Mr. W. Haskell, of New Haven; presented by the Corresponding Secretary. In continuance of his examination of the Vedic metres reported a year ago, Dr. Haskell gives more detailed statements with regard to the anustubh and gdyatrz stanzas. The Rig-Veda has 794 anustubh and 2435 gdyatrz verses, distributed as follows: an. gay. an. gayv. Book I. 107 469 VI. 45 134 II. 14 37 VII. 4 60 III. 22 104 Vlii. 112 734 IV. 26 112 IX. 49 599 V. 156 79 X. 259 107 Taking all the anustubh verses in Book I. as instancing the general structure of the metre. we find the distribution of light and heavy syllables (leaving out, here as later, a few doubtful ones) in all the four padas to be this: syllables i. ii. ii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. light 193 96 166 85 389 30 403 288 heavy 231 327 257 336 33 392 21 142 There is no noteworthy difference between the different padas as regards their structure The cadence - - - - is found in 88 per cent. of all the padas, a light syllable being about twice as common as a heavy at the end of the pada (58 to 30 per cent.). In the remaining 12 per cent. (50 padas) is found every variety of combination; in a few cases even the penultimate syllable is heavy. In the first half of the pada, the combination - - - is more frequent than any other (21 per cent.); the combination - - is decidedly less common (16 per cent.); the formula ~ -- - will satisfy over 63 per cent. of the cases. About 25 padas, in all the Books, are defective, or not to be filled out by any of the ordinary resolutions; 10 are redundant. Book X. has several padas (7) cxix</page><page sequence="16">lAmerican Oriental Society: that are entirely made up of heavy syllables. There are no anustubh hyniis with trochaic (or spondaic) cadence, aud even two such padas succeed one another in only 9 scattered verses. When o from as occurs before a in the cadence of the verse, it is usually to be scanned as light (the only exceptions are at viii.55.15; ix. 98.3; x. 159.1). Syllables like the initial a of asia for asya always occur iii cadence where they ought to be heavy (in ix. 66.18, the cadence may be regarded as trochaic). Cases where final n is doubled before an initial vowel are rare in anustubh cadence; but the syllable appears to count as a heavy one in a great majority (three-quarters) of cases in all metres. Again, for the gdyatrt, taking as example all the verses of this metre in Book I., the distribution of quantities throughout the padas appears to be this: syllables i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. light 638 304 473 245 1302 127 1307 888 heavy 754 1088 919 1147 90 1265 85 504 The predominance of heavy syllables in the first half of the pada is even more marked here than in the anustubh metre; by combining the percentages, the norm --- - - - has a value of nearly 78 per cent. for all the syllables; and - -- of over 88 per cent.; the cadence -- actually occurs in 86 per cent.; and the remainder are again of the most heterogeneous character. Hardly any (less than half-a-dozen) unmanageably defective padas are found, and not many more (7) redundant ones But besides not a few detached padas. and even stanzas, scattered through all the books, certain passages have the cadence wholly or predominantly trochaic or spondaic: they are, as noticed, viii. 2. 1-27, 29-41; 7.30, 32-5; 16. 1-12; 71. 1-9; 79. 1-8; 81. 1-9; ix. 66. 16-20; x. 20. 4-8; 185. 1-3. The estimate made of their quantities is as follows: syllables i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. light 113 65 101 69 130 170 56 199 heavy 166 213 177 209 145 100 220 77 By combining the percentages of the several syllables, the norm --- -- is found to be represented by 79 per cent. of the syllables, the proportion being very nearly the same in each of the three padas. But the number of padas which actually exhibit the ftull trochaic cadence - - - - is only 85, about a third of the- whole number. The irregularity of structure is decidedly greater among these verses than among the more usual gdyatris; and it seems quite doubtful whether the Vedic poets can be said to have formed and realized the conception of a. trochaic verse. The scattered padas with trocliaic or spondaic cadence number about 100, and an analysis of their structure yields results almost identical with those just given. 10. The Middle Pathway between the Orient and Occident- will it now be opened anlew and made safe ? by Prof. J. W. Jenks, of Newtonville, Mass. The author being obliged to leave before his paper was reached, it was pre-. sented and read in part by the Corresponding Secretary. Prof. Jenks reviews the position and recent activity of the European rivals in Asia, namely England and Russia, notes the distance separating their respective outposts, and the ter- niinations of the avenues for trade and peaceful intercourse established by them, and the character of the countries and races that lie between.
