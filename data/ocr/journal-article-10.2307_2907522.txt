<plain_text><page sequence="1">366 M L N Unamuno and Zola: Notes on the novel Descansa en paz, amigo Rafael. Spawned to a large degree by the colossal work of Hegel, the philosophic disputations which marked the last decades of the nineteenth century, the repercussions of which still seem to be very much with us, were in one way or another destined to become essential to the literary controversies whose focal point was realism. Positivism, Darwinism, empiricism, dialectical materialism, and the new sciences in general were to become the theoretical expedients for a realism in a new key which was to reach its maximum expression in the crowded canvases of Emile Zola. Yet at the same time that the objectivists were apparently envisioning a total victory, the grounds for disenchantment were being prepared by visionaries of another sort whose concern for " what is real " was to lead ultimately to a rejection of logico-pictorial representation as a strict norm in fiction; Comte, Taine, Marx and rigid dogmatism in general were to be challenged by philosopher- aestheticians like Kierkegaard, Bergson, Nietzche, Croce, who would focus on intrinsic human experiences and make these experiences central to their particular view of " the real." Personality, intuition, will, expression, were to become the lexicon of a generation of angry young men who eagerly pointed to the shortcomings of naturalism and who demanded a new novel which would express the predicament of man in extra-sociological terms; impressionism as a critical norm was to supplement their brilliant experiments in prose fiction. In Spain, Miguel de Unamuno was destined to play a major role in the tug of war whose end result was a radical trans- formation of the novel. Due to his enormous weight, Unamuno's deft attacks against social determinism and impersonalism were to enjoy wide currency and would contribute generously-perhaps inordinately-to the dethronement of nine- teenth-century realism, especially as it manifested itself in the works of Zola and his followers. Gripped by the immediacy of his arguments, and without the advantage of some seventy years' distance to fully appreciate Zola's contribution to the history of the novel, Unamuno may at times sound gratuitous to some of us. Nevertheless, his incisive forays into the essence of naturalism, especially as they are roughly contemporaneous with the movement itself, offer innumerable insights into the transition of prose fiction from the nineteenth century up to the present day. In addition, Unamuno's fiction stands as yet another testimony to this transition, thus supplementing for us the clarity of his theoretical insights. In certain respects, it seems that Unamuno would have no argument with Zola: certainly, both were convinced of the supreme mission of art</page><page sequence="2">M L N 367 and viewed it as a vital social function never to be divorced from central human problems; like Zola, Unamuno rejected art for art's sake as mean- ingless aestheticism, "stylism," as the latter referred to it. Genuine litera- ture, in the view of both writers, must be fully engaged with the vicissitudes of that cardinal animal known as man. Unamuno's theory of literature in general, especially as it is expressed during his early socialist period,' would no doubt have met with the approval of Zola: thoroughly immersed in Vico, Herder, Hegel, and the German aestheticians in general by his early twenties, Unamuno expounded the view that authors of great works were merely representatives of the popular sentiment and will. Works of art which merit immortality were the supreme synthesis of the trials, tribula- tions, and aspirations of a given people; the " popular spirit" was indeed the artist's workshop and his limitless source of inspiration. Literature- especially popular literature-was, according to Unamuno, the document which most reliably recorded the true history of a nation and its tradition.2 It is not difficult to see that Zola would have no serious objection to such a position.3 Nonetheless, and due principally to the fact that Unamuno's aesthetics are largely related to a particular anthropocentric view which is rooted in a neo-idealism, neo-individualism, and neo-Catholicism which were widespread during the waning of the nineteenth century, Zola and Unamuno part company in matters concerning ultimate values and how they are most effectively disseminated through literature; realism as it was practiced in the last decades of the nineteenth century was to become Unamuno's nemesis. By 1902, as a part of a zealous campaign for new directions in prose fiction, he had succeeded in his first important effort toward the eventual fracturing of the novel beyond recognition: signifi- cantly enough, Amor y pedagogia, a novel largely in dialogue, generously sprinkled with interior monologue, tells the story of a pedantic father who tries to raise his son in accordance with the rigid precepts of "sociological pedagogy." Avito Carrascal, hyperdeductive, lives in a world of aphorisms. His pseudo-scientific background leads him to conclude that science is the goal of humanity. Unamuno's earliest references to Zola are to be found in his corre- spondence from 1890-1892. In his letters to one Pedro de Mugica, a Basque philologist residing in Berlin, Unamuno reveals that he is well versed in the work of the French novelist and unqualifiedly praises Zola's con- 1 On this subject see the important work of our recently deceased colleague Rafael Perez de la Dehesa, Politica y sociedad en el primer Unamuno (Madrid. 1966). 2 I have treated Unamuno's theory of literature in greater detail in Unamuno and Spanish Literature (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967), 1-9, and in " Cervantes in Unamuno: Toward a Clarification," Romanic Review, LX (1969), 178-185.

Unamuno's eventual dismissal of Taine as a negative influence in literary criticism6 parallels his sometimes remorseless sallies against biological and environmental determinism clothed in prose fiction. However, and this seems to be an appropriate place to comment on it, Unamuno's disenchantment with naturalism does not degenerate into a polemic exclusively aimed at exposing the obviously naive doctrines contained in Le Roman Experimental for what they were. He seems to have been aware of the simplistic pitfalls of such a method, and avoids basing his arguments on what Zola's most eloquent apologists- Croce, Auerbach, Angus Wilson, to mention a few-have adequately exposed as being invalid. Much more widely read, philosophically, histori- cally, and linguistically oriented, Unamuno was better equipped to approach Zola than were his average critics. Two uncollected articles by Unamuno which are specifically concerned with the social novel are of special import to our discussion.7 Their ' Sergio Fernandez Larrain, Cartas ineditas de Miguel de Unamuno (Santiago, 1965), p. 125: "El castellano, el castellano antiguo lo mismo que el moderno, es una abstracci6n . . . es una lengua literaria, especie de superfetaci6n, idioma de las personas cultas que vegeta como una excrecencia elegante sobre los dialectos populares, vivos y flexibles. Zola ha hecho a la filologia un servicio inmenso con L'Assommoir. El mismo dice en el pr6logo: 'personne n'a entrevu que ma volonte 6tait de faire un travail purement philologique, que je crois d'un vif interet historique et social.' Estudiemos los supuestos barbarismos del pueblo . . ." See also p. 167: " No lo de usted vueltas. Zola, que no es santo de mi devoci6n, Zola con sus sintetizaciones y sus cosas, ha hecho mis por la cultura y el verdadero progreso que todos los Tobler, Meyer, Hibner, Paris, etc...." On Zola's interest in popularisms, see Henri Massis, Comment Emile Zola composait ses Romans (Paris, 1906), 331-341. Ibid., p. 115. 6 Compare ibid., p. 141: "A Taine le conozco mucho ... Es a mi juicio el primer pensador y acaso el primer escritor contemporaneo en Francia . . . Taine es una maravilla" (1891), with the unequivocal rejection of Taine as "uno de los mas peligrosos maestros de criticas literaria e hist6rica" (1923) in Obras completas (Madrid, 1959-64), VIII, p. 1071, hereafter referred to by volume and page numbers. I wish to acknowledge my debt to Professor Rafael Perez de la Dehesa of Berkeley for access to these documents, and to add that without his work, much of mine on Unamuno would have been impossible.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 369 discussion in detail seems to be desirable for two reasons: on the one hand these documents are not readily available; secondly, they represent the most complete, direct discussion of the social novel to be found among Unamuno's writings, while at the same time they contain all the seeds of the ideas which would eventually be translated into new forms of fiction. The first of these articles, " Notas sobre el determinismo en la novela," was published in an anarchist journal in 1898.8 This is a year usually pointed to as a time in which certain crucial changes in Unamuno's philosophic attitude become patent. He begins to demonstrate an explicit distaste for positivism and the imperious role assigned to science by its most myopic adulators. The article in question, while refuting deter- minism on a purely theoretical level, is also a succinct effort to relate certain theoretical deficiencies to their effect on characterization in fiction. It abounds with references to Zola. The stated purpose of Unamuno's article is to examine the legacy of a movement which was apparently running its course. In doing so, he points to what he considers to be Zola's unquestionable contribution to the novel as history in the strict sense; with their concern for documentation, Unamuno asserts, Zola and the naturalists had succeeded in consummating that ideal marriage of history and fiction through which history becomes a living record of everyday events as they were occurring. Where such a happy marriage of history and fiction do occur, continues Unamuno, the effect is a union of external reality with truth; truth and beauty become coexistents: Cuando una historia, sin dejar de serlo en todo rigor, produzca el efecto estetico de una novela, sera cuando a la realidad, que es algo externo, se haya unido la verdad, que es interna; a lo pasajero lo permanente. Entonces nos acercaremos a ver la intima identidad de la verdad y de la belleza, y la comprensi6n de c6mo es esta el resplandor de aquella. The task which remains, concludes Unamuno, is the artistic fusion of psychology and the sociological (i.e., the historical). Other favorable remarks in " Notas sobre el determinismo en la novela" include the observation that the application of a scientific theory of fiction, despite its excesses, had enriched the novel to the extent that unbridled fantasy would no longer be acceptable in prose fiction. Unamuno also contends that as opposed to the "reflexive " Zola whose mediocre back- ground in science led him to awkward stances, there exists a " spontaneous " Zola, a poet whose roots are romantic and whose faculties include a potent vision of the real.9 We note in passing that there is implicit in this con- 8 Published in La Revista Blanca, I (1898), 288-291. 9This view of two Zolas seems to have been fairly widespread. See, e.g., Josephson, op. cit., 228; 375-376. Lukacs, in Studies in European Realism (New</page><page sequence="5">370 M L N tention an equation of poetry and the real, a theme which was to reach its maximum elaboration in the later work of Unamuno. Yet the fact of the matter is, according to Unamuno, that Zola's inordi- nate concern with psychological determinism is ultimately responsible for his inability to create convincing characters. Through arguments which bear a striking resemblance to certain observations made by Lukacs, Unamuno concludes that most of Zola's characters are overly-simplified symbols lacking in vitality: they are a sort of grey mean, an average arrived at statistically, extrapolated through the observation of an aggregate set of characteristics common to a mass of humans. The problem lies in the fact that when X or Y individual from this same group is forced to perform as the mean representative of the group, to typify the group, he becomes an abstraction, an ideal mean. As such, he loses his ability to leave a lasting impression.10 Unamuno argues that Zola, who was quick to criticize the ancients for using personification or allegory instead of persons, had not enhanced characterization much himself; Coupeau, although not drunken- ness itself, is no more than a drunken mean, " sacado de monografias de patologia mas que de la realidad viva." The difference between Zola and the ancients in this matter is that Zola, although he does not resort to a general abstraction (e.g. avarice), does resort to what is a particular abstraction (an avaricious type): he does not portray a concrete, greedy person, or individual.11 The second of the two uncollected articles, "La novela contemporanea y el movimiento social," was published in 1903.12 In this article Unamuno allots to the novel the lofty position of supreme literary genre; the novel is a " g6nero de integraci6n," which allows for the fusion of epic, lyric, and dramatic elements, while also allowing for the fusion of art and science. York, 1964), claims that when Zola departs from naturalism, "he is immediately transmuted into a decorative picturesque romanticist," (p. 93), while Croce rejects the widely affirmed notion of Zola as a poet of "epic breadth " in European Literature in the Nineteenth Century (London, 1924), 317-318. 10 Cf. Lukacs " a mechanical average takes the place of the dialectic unity of type and individual . . . Zola's method . . . because it was the result of the writer's position as solitary observer, prevents any profoundly realistic repre- sentation of life. Zola's 'scientific' method always seeks the average, and this grey statistical mean, the point at which all internal contradictions are blunted, where the great and the petty, the noble and the base, the beautiful and the ugly are all mediocre 'products' together, spells the doom of great literature" (op. cit., 90-91). Angus Wilson refutes Lukacs in Emile Zola (New York, 1952), 115-116. 11 Unamuno uses Coupeau to illustrate his argument on more than one occasion. What about Gervaise? Wilson, op. cit., p. 111 says of Zola's heroine that she " is perhaps the most completely conceived character, belonging to that great class of submerged, unindividual figures that make up the very poor, to be found in all nineteenth-century literature." 12 La Revista Blanca, XV (1903), 559-564.</page><page sequence="6">M L N 371 While defending the symbiosis novel-science, Unamuno points out that there is no reason to proscribe this desirable union simply because it was not successful in the past. The error of what was once called naturalism, he states, was not that it relied on science, but rather that it relied on a false science, and relied on it in a false way. Unamuno then proceeds to analyze determinism and its effect on Zola's characters, much in the way that we have seen above. He adds that Zola's characters never surprise us: " no nos sorprenden nunca, como los hombres reales y vivos nos sorprenden con algo que no esperaramos de ellos." Unamuno contends that science, as well as art, requires a good deal of imagination. He distinguishes between "seeing" and "imagining" as follows: while most people merely see an object, that is to say, record it mentally as it is, there are some who see and imagine it simultaneously; the latter are capable of retaining a real view of the object long after seeing it; this intense vision, or the imagining of the object in its absence represents, according to Unamuno, a huge advantage in terms of a scientific knowledge of the object, "cuando tal conocimiento es vivo y no muerto." Strongly implicit in Unamuno's argument is that the literal portrayal of objects is not sufficient; the intercession of that third element known as imagination is just as crucial to the novelist as it is to the scientist. Pictorial realism is deficient, perhaps even irrelevant, as Unamuno will begin to declare quite loudly after 1905. In " La novela contemporanea y el movimiento social " Unamuno buttresses this argument metaphorically by comparing a work of art to " un buen animal." As is the case with a well-constructed animal, a work of art must have its skeleton as well as its outer covering of flesh, 'hueso bajo la carne; " with obvious reference to detailed realism and biological determinism, Unamuno adds that it is not really necessary to see the bones, for the animal without skeleton is unable to stand or sit cor- rectly, while the facts regarding who engendered him have little to do with the matter. Considerations on the role of the individual imagination in the creation of art eventually lead Unamuno to speculations which represent a clear break from some of the most cherished tenets of nineteenth-century realism. " La novela contemporanea y el movimiento social " ends with an exhortation to social novelists to revive a dead form by playing down doctrinaire stances while injecting into the novel elements which would make it a "Juego de pasiones; " after all it is said and done, the game of prose-all art for that matter-is a personal game of passions; the social movement itself cannot really be appealing until " se haya individualizado." Unamuno's extremely anthropocentric view of literature propels him to the conclusion that art was made for man and not vice-versa; rejecting what he calls " dogma estetico," Unamuno states " Yo tomo el arte para mi, para mi propio recreo." Such, in effect, would be the game of passion played</page><page sequence="7">372 M L N out with an almost monomaniacal consistency in all the novels produced by Unamuno between 1902 and 1933, some three decades devoted to new causes in fiction. The year 1905 marks a point of no return. While it is true that virtually all of Unamuno's novels can be viewed as a concrete extension of his attitude towards conventional prose realism, it is with the publication of La vida de don Quixote y Sancho that this attitude reaches its most defini- tive form. His effort to revive and hypostatize the individual hero-always anthropomorphic, always "real "-is paralleled by a stubborn, largely implicit undermining of naturalism throughout La vida de don Quixote y Sancho. As I have described it elsewhere,13 this masterpiece, with its deliberate blurring of literary genres, represents Unamuno's most concen- trated effort to dethrone determinism through literary impressionism; it is a ferocious attack on criticism written in the name of scientific objec- tivism. The opening paragraphs of La vida de don Quixote y Sancho are an adequate illustration of this intentionally exaggerated position: para- phrasing Cervantes' masterpiece, Unamuno stresses that nothing is known of the lineage of the unique knight Quisada, Quesada, or Quijana. He concludes that it is strange that the studious erudites who have devoted so much attention to this enigma have not been able to determine Don Quixote's origins scientifically, especially in an era which gives so much attention to determining man's destiny in terms of his heredity. The sarcasms become obvious, and these oblique attacks against Zola and his followers set the tone for the vitalism, personalism, and individualism which characterize the whole book. Aside from the references to Zola discussed above, there are numerous references to the French novelist scattered all over Unamuno's myriad, unindexed complete works.14 A strictly chronological examination of these references reveals that the closer they approach the unfettered personalism of 1905, the more they tend to be less generous in their appraisal of Zola. The most detailed and important of these references appears in the essay "La regeneraci6n del teatro espafiol," published in 1896. Significantly enough, this essay is an encomium to popular, demotic literature as it is reflected in the classical Spanish theater, or in the ballad, for example. Lope de Vega is lionized as one who saw the theater through the eyes of " el pueblo; " such writers become the incarnation of the spirit of the people. As regards Zola, Unamuno describes him as a "soberano artista cuando habla en necio, en romantico," and praises him for his vigorous depiction of the masses, " que pinta con honda verdad por ser 1l mismo 13 In Miguel de Unamuno (Columbia Essays on Modern Writers, New York, 1969), 15-24. 4' I have compiled an unpublished onomastic index to the 16 volumes of the complete works, thanks to the financial assistance given me at Berkeley.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 373 un pueblo." Yet this does not absolve Zola for his inadequacies: his indi- vidual characters are caricatures extracted from treatises; as such they are mere abstract concepts. Unamuno adds that " todo lo que no sea ver en intuici6n es pura abstracci6n y alquimia, saquese de la ideologia escolastica o de la psicofisiologia" (III, 350). Positive references to Zola's work become quite scarce between 1904 and 1914, the latter being the year in which any meaningful references seem to cease altogether. By 1904, just one year after the publication of "La novela contemporanea y el movimiento social," yet only a year before the publication of his definitive position in La vida de don Quixote y Sancho, Unamuno rejects Zola as a laborious descriptionist who stuffed his pages with puerile, insignificant details; he characterizes Zola as an " oviparous " writer, meaning one who writes according to a hermetic, fixed, mechanical plan which precludes any spontaneity (III, 793). Two years later, while paraphrasing Schopenhauer's classification of writers into three types, Unamuno consigns Zola to the category of " professional," and attributes all his shortcomings to a cold, detached approach to the social phenomena which would be converted into a novel (V, 228). The year 1907 finds Unamuno still belligerently campaigning against " cientificismo," and in an article bearing this same title, he compares characterization in Flaubert, of whom he was extremely fond, to characteri- zation in Zola. Referring to Papini's contention that the best disciples of Comte were to be found in Flaubert's pages in the form of Homais, Bouvard, and Pecuchet, Unamuno adds that this also applies in the case of Zola's Dr. Pascal. These characters are all caricatures who typically repre- sent " cientificismo," with the difference that Flaubert's heroes are " carica- turas concientes," created by a sensitive artist with a clear sense of the value of science, while Zola's Dr. Pascal is a "caricatura inconciente," forged by a mind " que padeci6 de cientificismo " (IV, 525).15 In this same year, 1907, in the article " Historia y novela," Unamuno was to reverse his position regarding Zola's contribution to the novel as history; he opts for "la historia novelesca" to be found in Carlyle, Gibbon, Michelet, as compared to the so-called historical novels of Zola (IV, 930-31). This preference was to be reiterated in 1910, with the addition that Zola's novels contain more bad history than they do good fiction (IV, 802), while in 1911, Unamuno hurls the label "descripcionismo" at Zola during a retrospective evaluation of the novelist "a quien tan en exceso leimos y admiramos hace afios" (IV, 880). With increasing social concern with the effects which a misdirected, imperious science would have on the human individual, Unamuno ham- 15 Wilson in op. cit., p. 97, claims that it is unfair to criticize Le Docteur Pascal as a work of art since 'its main purpose is to tie up the loose ends of the family chronicle."</page><page sequence="9">374 M L N mers harder on the theme of depersonalization with each passing year. His call for a return to individual values becomes part of a gigantic effort to appraise, and thus expose, what he considered to be the meaningless, insane cult for progress in a vacuum; with uncommon certitude, he would eventually prognosticate the modern dilemma brought about by the divorcement of science and human needs. With this macabre possibility in mind, he applies his concern for what is " humanly concrete," or "vital," to his literary criticism. Thus, in 1912, in a foreword to the Spanish edition of Croce's classical work on aesthetics, we find Zola listed among the " definadores" who infest aesthetics with pedantry; one of those who simply could not understand that only concepts are definable, whereas art intuits individuals. Unamuno concludes that science defines, while art narrates or names, and that the grey scientific mean is definable yet not an object of art (VII, 247). Two years later, he refers to Zola as a pseu- dorealist and laments the contribution of the French novelist to the disappearance in fiction of " el individuo voluntario, activo, apasionado" (VIII, 924), the character which Unamuno was to create in his own fiction. As we have already indicated, Unamuno's novels stand as an extreme complement to his extreme battle against nineteenth-century materialism in prose form. They complete what is sometimes a remorseless effort against precisely those techniques which were responsible for an age of great works of prose fiction. By 1914, with publication of Niebla, Unamuno had solidly substantiated his claim that there was something quite "real" involved in the presentation of extreme, inner, human passions. The naked personality who is the protagonist of this novel, the intentionally blurred, disjointed Augusto who frantically seeks to affirm his existence, represents Unamuno's supreme dramatization of what he considered to be intrinsic realities. In one way or another, this blurred human soul would find his counterpart in Unamuno's successive efforts to create individual human essences: the tortured, introspective, Dostoyevskean Joaquin in Abel Sdnchez (1917); the extremely convincing, incarnate passions of the skeletal narratives in Tres novelas ejemplares (1920); the autobiographical, tormented priest in San Manuel Bueno, Mdrtir (1933), and what can be considered Unamuno's final, decisive farewell to the aesthetics of objective realism in the form of Don Sandalio (1933), the fracturing of prose fiction beyond recognition.
