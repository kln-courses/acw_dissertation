<plain_text><page sequence="1">Models, Metaphors, and Matter Artists and Scientists Visualize Scientific Concepts Cellular Archaeology SUZANNE ANKER ashioning a chart with scissors and paste, the labo- ratory technician matches identical pairs of chromo- somes in alphabetical and numerical size places. This artificial arrangement of "colored bodies," reminiscent of paper dolls, is known as a karyotype. Congruent with an ideogram or a shorthand language, this synthetic arrange- ment behaves like a museum display, encoding a morpholo- gy of signs. A cellular archaeologist, the laboratory investigator correlates subtle differences in identity among specimens. Differences, for example, between a fish, a flower, or a bacteria can be discerned by looking at linear configurations of an organism's abstract sequence. As arrangements of sets, chromosomes form categories by which types of life are catalogued. Through a system of reduction, the organism's mathematical formula is translat- ed from an invisible understructure of living matter to a visual notation. As with the Cubists, the sign becomes an abbreviated blueprint of cultural code summarizing the materialization of idea into visual form. In contrast, biologi- cal signs employ an assembly of life fractions to form the basis of their scientific symbols. Defining an organism from a collection of fragments creates a fabricated condition comparable to metonomy and museum display. When cultural traces are put into a museum, or as Douglas Crimp states, taken out of context and put into a fictional historical lineage, this institutional structure of depository and presentation alludes to the concept of uni- versal knowledge.1 The karyotype, like the museum dis- play, constructs the notion of identity from material configuration and style. Does material evidence form the basis of identity alone or, as with art, do methods of envi- ronmental manipulation control evolutionary develop- ment? Whereas this form of genetic mapping is being replaced by a molecular script, archaic scientific diagrams force the question of how information is transferred from a scientific system to a cultural one. (Even when defunct in 33 Suzanne Anker, Zoosemiotics: Primates, 1993, glass vessel (1000 ml), steel, water, hydrocal, and metallic pigment, 82 x 144 x 84 inches.

The chromosome, perhaps second only to the double helix, marks the twentieth century's iconic interest in the invisi- ble. As abstract language interfaces with global and cyber- netic space, the lines distinguishing scientific iconology from cultural consequence are engaged and mutually transformed. How does an image move from scientific dis- course into cultural space? Note 1. Douglas Crimp, On the Museum's Ruins (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1993), 44-64.

From the Blood of Poets KEVIN CLARKE T oday, notions of individuality are dissolving, in part due to chemical procedures that alter a per- son's genetic makeup. In my photographs I explore portraiture by combining an "individual-specific" DNA sequence derived from the blood of my "sitter" with an image that I associate with the person. I photograph with a color negative and retain the negative in the final print. In 1987 I began a collaboration with genetic research scientists and with a small company, Applied Biosystems, manufacturers of DNA-sequencing equipment and chemical agents. My graphics adhered to the following prototype: my own DNA was isolated from a blood sample, caused to self- replicate in a controlled way, and sequenced. The procedure focused on a specific region of my genome. As new chemical procedures have come along, I have incorporated them into my portraits so that the por- traits are state-of-the-science genetic representations. My guiding questions are notions of individuality and the point when individual characteristics converge into a portrait. Although I use a systematic method, pictorially, I try to remain as free as possible. My portraits include the dancer Merce Cunningham, his chromosomes shown with falling Mikado sticks; the musician La Monte Young, featuring a pastoral landscape with steeplechase; and artist Jeff Koons, incorporating a slot machine. The men and women I choose as subjects are people who interest me and with whom I am acquainted. Acquaintance helps when asking a person for some blood, and many of my requests have been greeted with silence. As an experienced photographer I have been startled to recognize parallels between the methods of early photog- raphy and genetics. Both record substances regardless of scale. For decades, radiologists, crystallographers, and those who record karyotypes (photographs of chromo- somes) have employed procedures inherently parallel to photography, the chemical reproduction of a world made visible in negative. It is not the thing itself that the geneti- cist views, but the shadow of the thing, it's chemical trace. In PCR (polymerase chain reaction), discovered by Kary Mullis, rapid automated DNA is isolated and separat- ed from it's helical opposite, like separating one half of a zipper from the other. One half is chemically induced to replicate. While replicating, the density of the bases of the newly generated nucleotide is measured and defined by a laser. The light from the laser allows an invisible substance to be captured and analyzed with precision. Through genetics I have arrived at an approach to portraiture that is at the roots of photographic thinking. These are portraits with a focus on the invisible.

Artistic Vision and Molecular Genetics AGNES DENES Pattern-finding is the purpose of the mind and the construct of the universe. There are an infinite number of patterns, some of which are known; those still unknown hold the key to unresolved enigmas and paradoxes.1 aF ^or over twenty-five years, I have been consistently synthesizing science into my art, exploring themes that have become prominent in the new genetics. Although my art was not created with genetic engineering in mind, it foreshadowed today's research developments SPRING 1996</page><page sequence="3">and the realization that we need to know who we are and where we are heading, and that some of this information lies in the mapping and visualization of invisible, elusive processes. Scientific innovation can go hand in hand with innovative art that seeks to overcome its boundaries in order to explore the invisible, underlying structures and operations of existence. Around 1966 I began work on Visual Philosophy, an investigation launched across a wide range of human knowledge in an attempt to create a flow of communication among disciplines alienated through specialization. The work evolved into a visual expression that incorporated sci- entific and philosophic thought and a spectrum of analytical concepts questioning human evolution, value systems, and the survival of the species. My investigations included the sciences and technology, theology and linguistics, future urban planning and global issues of survival. I created visu- al metaphors for such abstract concepts as time, evolution, thinking processes, mathematics, and logic. Many of my works, such as the Introspection series, have explored genetic metaphors. Introspection L Evolu- tion (1969-71) is a seventeen-foot mural that traces human evolution through man's physical and cultural development. Introspection II. Machines, Tools, &amp; Weapons (1972) investigates and charts the growth of technology and man's understanding (lack of) his own inventions (i.e., what will man do with gene literacy?), while Introspection III. Aesthetics (1972) analyzes the processes of art making and reads the art by penetration of its layers and surfaces. Map Projections (1973-79) maps space and human perimeters, while Thought Complex (1972) diagrams com- binations of thought sequences to arrive at brain functions (pattern recognition, capacity for inventiveness), creating possible maps for the mind. Syzygy (1972-73), another work completed around this time, is an anatomical study of reality. It is a visual metaphor for time/space infinity, illus- trating that the human mind can transcend barriers of time, space, even its own cognition. Strength Analysis-A Dic- tionary (1971) maps language-words, signs, and sym- bols-the bits and pieces that make up the "script" of human communication (my personal Genome Project took eleven years to complete, seven of which were spent buried in Webster's unabridged dictionary, 1965-71). Morse Code Message (1969) brings into analytical view another intangi- ble and invisible system-religion. When "the word" is translated into veiled signs and symbols, "the meaning of the message" is allowed to re-emerge as new insight. Pattern recognition, mapping, sequencing, decoding, and visualizing make up the language of molecular genet- ics. Finding invisible patterns, interpreting the text, and applying the results is what the Genome Project is all about. When art renders into visual form these analytical processes, the hybrid becomes the script in a new language of seeing and knowing: a summation and dramatization of 35 Agnes Denes, Thought Complex-Mapping the Mind: Sequential Visualization of Combinations of Thought Patterns as Applied to Theoretical Crystallography, 1972, ink, 36 x 221/2 inches. Courtesy the artist. new associations and analogies. The powerful tools of this new science can thus be enhanced by the equally powerful tools of artistic vision, image, and metaphor, which become expressions of human values with profound impact on our consciousness and collective destiny. There are many questions that remain to be answered. Can this benign force be a match for the forces unleashed by the full knowledge of the human genome? What will the benefits, ethical ramifications, and overall impact of a genet- ically manipulated future be for our civilization? Will genet- ic engineering change humanity forever? - Note 1.

Jelly Lovers: Dreams of Causality MICHAEL JOAQUIN GREY elly Lovers depicts two three-dimensional virtual objects, exemplifying self-organizing systems. These are two of many neural networks that I have document- ed in collaboration with Randolf Huff since 1989. The forms and behavior resemble tertiary proteins involved in a qua- ternary interaction (the communication between two tertiary forms). The primary structure originates from the develop- ment of information produced by a random number genera- tor. The data is processed by the neural network (software we designed that has the capability of simple independent learning), generating the secondary and tertiary structure of the medusa-like conformations. The information is processed and the morphological changes are visualized on a super computer. Occasionally, genetic algorithms recom- bine and reorganize the information between different neur- al networks, creating quaternary communication. The output is colored wax on Mylar, similar to a car- toon animation. The growth of each network, its complete "life cycle" or "learning cycle," is on average about 250,000 iterations, generating enough cell frames to illus- trate a full-length feature film. What is presented here is one still image from a single neural network animation. A random number generator creates the basic condi- tions for the self-organizing system. Because no random number generator is perfectly random, the network incor- porates some of these biases into its development. We see these changes visually expressed in the morphological dif- ference between separate networks, as well as in the varia- tion within the same network (when developed under alternative primary conditions). Each network has its own specific general morphology (i.e., analogous to a genetic structure or genotype), and each network has individual variations generated by environmental factors. These are created by separate runs of the random number generator and unique selective behavior of the genetic algorithms (i.e., creating distinctive phenotypes). Starting with a platonic solid, a spherical pseudo cell, we watched and recorded the differentiation of form by visualizing the information space. This led to the obser- vation of many hundred thousand states of the neural net- work and subsequently to a comparison of development with other networks that we designed. Finally, the end product of this ontogeny of information was a population of self-organizing systems that had many characteristics uncanny in their similarity to protolanguages and embry- ological development of living form. We observed basic behaviors mimicking formally-reproduction, locomotion, interaction, and life cycles. It is a temptation to use such anthropomorphic analogs. They represent one of the most interesting aspects of the work for me. Experiencing the problems associated with naming and identifying differ- ence in a population or system almost inevitably leads to the linear process of observation, description, explanation, and finally exploitation of form. This process of decision making seems parsimonious and central to the success of "Western" thought as well as to progress in terms of tech- nology. However, we are aware of the liabilities of this way of thinking. The formation of any language or system cre- ates biases, whether natural or artificial. Hubris and preju- dice seem inherent to the conception and implementation of almost all epistemological models, no matter how well intentioned or formal their origins. Because of technology, we are close to being able to observe the behavior of information on an order of magni- tude approaching the complexity of natural systems. These random interactions can take on form and anthropomor- phic identity beyond the formal and aesthetic. Conceivably it can take only a few more decisions of quality and form to generate a narrative of social significance. Choices eventu- ally have ramifications that cross information space into the social realms of politics, religion, or ethics. Whether it be Anton van Leeuwenhoek recording the first observation of cells from the microcosmic or Johannes Kepler looking at the macrocosmic with new technology, we cannot avoid the hermeneutics of meaning developing beyond the boundaries of the formal exercise of objectivity. Be it religion, art, or science we recapitulate, the elusive asymptotic approach to truth and clarity is often only another story from our dreams of causality. _ SPRING 1996 36</page><page sequence="5">Portrait of a Genome RUTH KAVENOFF am a cell biologist who uses the electron microscope to study the structure of chromosomes. BlueGenes #1 reproduces a photograph of a purified bacterial chro- mosome, my favorite out of several thousand pictures. I think the photograph illustrates the beauty associ- ated with science. The image is intrinsically pleasing. But the photograph is also beautiful because it represents an accord between theory and experiment that yields a refined view of the world. A multiple-loops model of bacterial DNA was deduced logically by Abraham Worcel and Eliz- abeth Burgi from a series of experiments that did not involve any direct microscopic observations.1 The photograph confirmed the theoretical model. One long molecule of DNA is twisted like a rubber band into many highly coiled loops that radiate from a central core composed of RNA and protein. Each loop is a portion of the (circular) bacterial double-helix DNA molecule, wound back on itself. (The DNA double helix appears as a single line.) This organization is important because the DNA molecule is about a thousand times longer than the bacterial cell. This chromosome was purified from the common intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli.2 Purifying a chromo- some is rather like obtaining an egg yolk from an egg, e.g., cracking the cell with an enzyme and separating the chro- mosome. This procedure probably forms the central core, so that the structure we observe is an artifact; however, there is evidence that the structure we see is a valuable clue to the state of the chromosome inside the living cell. E. coli has been studied exhaustively by several genera- tions of molecular biologists with the popular belief: if it's true for E. coli, it's true for elephants, only more so. Most genetic engineering employs E. coli as a host and/or a source of cloning materials (i.e., enzymes and/or genes). However, lately, one nonhuman strain of E. coli, 0157:H7, has caused serious health problems due to toxin-producing genes apparently aquired from another bacterial species; this unfortunate example of microbial evolution has tar- nished the public image of all E. coli. Uncoiled, the DNA molecule in this chromosome is about one millimeter long and twenty angstroms wide. (One angstrom is one-ten millionth of a millimeter.) Twenty angstroms is so small that it cannot be seen, even with an electron microscope. Twenty angstroms can be seen in an electron scanning tunneling microscope (STM) or an atom- ic force microscope (AFM). These microscopes can visual- ize fine details like the two strands of the double helix in small segments of DNA, but they are not suited to DNA molecules as large as the bacterial chromosome. There- fore, in order for the molecule to be seen, it must be coat- 37 Ruth Kavenoff and Brian C. Bowen, BlueGenes #1, 1983, lithographic print from a transmission electron-microscope photograph, blue on white, 6 x 41/4 inches. Courtesy DesignerGenes Posters, Del Mar, Calif. ed. To make this photograph, the DNA was coated with protein (to make it thicker and spread it out on a water sur- face), picked up on an electron microscope grid (a disk that is only a few millimeters in diameter), and "stained" with uranium salt (to give it contrast in the electron beam). The DNA was also "spray painted" with platinum and pal- ladium metal to give it additional contrast and thickness. Staining and rotary shadowing also enhance any "free" protein molecules so that they appear as the many tiny dots in the background. The photograph was taken with a trans- mission electron microscope (which is about the size of a baby grand piano) equipped with a camera and Kodak fine- grain positive film. The photograph has a magnification of about ten thousand times. Large as it is, this bacterial DNA mole- cule, a "genome" (containing about 4.8 million base pairs), is only about one-tenth the length of the DNA molecule in the smallest human chromosome and only about one-thou- sandth the size of the entire human genome.3 _ Notes 1.

Being an artist today is like trying to be the fastest athlete in the world without a coach and without a team to play on. Imagine being a molecular biol- ogist before an audience viewing biology at the level of Mendel. We are the first generation of artists to face the problem not of mortality but of immortality. DNA is more than just software. It is software that grows the wetware in which it lives. Max Delbruck, a founder of molecular biology, thought it paradoxical that the same matter as the matter of physics could behave in accordance with the laws of physics, and yet could not be accounted for by those same laws. The answer, Delbruck felt, lay not in the continued snipping away of DNA frag- ments into common particles, but in the recognition that by immersing oneself in a swamp of living tissue one would be able to observe new paradoxes and new laws of nature ris- ing to the surface. I have recently applied this outlook to painting, as in Somites, 1992. With a few simple laboratory procedures, a suite of paintings is grown from E. coli bacteria that have been genetically altered to produce colored enzymes and protein combinations reacting with genetic trace dyes. The work is completely transparent when painted, a sensation like trying to paint on ice with melted snow. After a period of sixteen to eighteen hours, growth is arrested by removing moisture from the plate. Air is sealed out with a synthetic resin, and the work enters a period of stasis. The work, while stable, is neither "dead" nor "finished." It exists in a state of suspended animation; at any time the resin may be SPRING 1996 ruck</page><page sequence="7">removed, the plate scraped, fed, and placed in an incuba- tion room to grow to a new stage of development. The subjects of the first suite of paintings were cho- sen to reflect states of health applicable to bacteria and humans. The second suite displayed early developmental stages common to all mammals. Recently, diptychs were created where each panel is a clone of its partner. Mounted perpendicular to the wall plane, the light passing through the plates creates a continuous chain of reflected progeny. Viewers without a priori knowledge as to the media or sub- ject matter comment that "something is different here," and ask if the work is alive. Another odd result, even for the artist, is that the imagery is so lively the mind cannot complete a reliable topography of the painting: sudden appearances of new phenomena reveal themselves to be preexisting conditions when the painting is compared to the transparencies. Contemporary science and contemporary art have many aspects in common; no longer can either be under- stood through simple observation, yet with a little educa- tion whole new worlds of experience open up before us. Current technology renders Matthew Barney as immortal as Michelangelo. What avocations will be satisfying when faced with the prospect of continual change? Or the prospect of continually renewed youthful bodily functions? Artists may no longer create meaning from the world so much as they may assemble life itself. Ideas are forms of life. The artifacts humans create, as painters or bankers, are mere temporal bodies for these life forms. Our artifacts must now be conducive to prolong- ing their own survival. Thus the sale of any living artifact requires an approach to benefit that artifact. We must ask, What does this artifact want? Where does it want to live? _ David Kremers, Somites, 1992, agar, E. coli, TB-1, x Gal, Coomassie blue stain and gesso on acrylic plate, 24 x 24 inches. Private collection. An Excerpt from a Lecture JOHN NEWMAN et's compare sculpture to other objects or other message objects. I think a good example to contrast with sculpture is the scientific model. Let's compare a globe of the world or Watson and Crick's DNA model to a work of sculpture. If an art object is a carrier of complex thought, which I believe the painter Barnett Newman said often, and therefore seemingly some kind of model or mir- ror of reality, how is it different from a scientific model? The obvious difference is that the scientific model is pur- posely scaled down or zoomed up to convey or illustrate all the information intended. Material and construction are ancillary aspects that involve other concerns, usually by the most efficient means of design, rather than by pointing to the information being presented. As a message object, the scientific model functions as an indexical sign-as a pointer-calling attention to the phenomena and informa- tion that reside in another realm of experience, knowledge, and physical realization. The scientific model's commu- nicative function is comprehended because of a consensus by community and a succinctly demonstrated representa- tion of the theory or principle it hopes to make manifest. The work of sculpture, on the other hand, is in scale- deliberate as to itself, and this raises completely different sets of concerns. Its information is revealed in the present without a lag, in terms of body relationships. Scale is intu- itive and not based on size or measure. Scale is an intuitive and therefore emotional and behavioral involvement because of shared space. I like to say that viewing sculp- ture is a little like two dogs feeling out each other's territo- ry. How close can I get? Can I get closer? Can I stick my nose in there or not? Will I get bitten or licked? This terri- torial relationship brings up questions of intimacy and danger and speaks to a whole other spectrum of sculpture's concerns that are predominately personal and emotional. The construction and materiality of a work of sculp- ture is also inherent in the sign function of the sculpture in that the sculpture points predominately to itself. This cir- cularity of purpose creates a behavioral relationship with the object; the image, the matter, and the information become intertwined as a self-referring instrument. One's own experience of the process of unfolding how this thing in shared space and real time presents itself to us is the existential challenge. The sculpture is then an index, a mirror, and a foil for itself, and through this challenge a larger social meaning can be gleaned. On making and viewing sculpture, the circumstance at hand is basically a form of provocation. What is this thing and what am I doing here asking the question, What ART JOURNAL 39</page><page sequence="8">40 is this thing? And underlying, therefore, What am I doing here? And then, How do I take from the fullness of this particular experience of emotion and information and bring it out in the world as I question other things and events? These other things raise more and contingent questions, and the spiral of meaning and experience end- lessly loops out into the world and flashes back on that par- ticular and private experience of being with the work. Note This essay is excerpted from a lecture given at the Fort Wayne Museum of Art in conjunction with the exhibition John Newman: Sculpture and Works on Paper. The Art of Molecular Modeling MARVIN R. RICH he human genome consists of approximately one hundred thousand genes. Each of these genes codes for a unique protein, or sequence of amino acids. In many cases the number of amino acids is in the hundreds, making the number of atoms in the thousands. In the milieu of the cell, these long strands of amino acids fold upon themselves, producing unique three-dimension- al structures. The patterns found within these three-dimen- sional protein structures are a combination of helices, John Newman, Untitled, 1994, collage, chalk, pencil, charcoal, and colored pencil on paper, 79 x 51 inches.

Many of these uncanny pro- tein structures are scientifically elusive and physically complex, yet from an artistic standpoint they are highly creative and abstract. Even for the most experienced chemist, it is difficult to record and describe all of the shapes and movements that occur within a protein. To truly understand the function of a protein, however, it is impera- tive to understand its structure. To understand and describe the actions and interac- tions of these protein structures, scientists have had, in essence, to become artists in their own right. They have turned to artistic renditions and visualizations produced by computers; these computer models allow the scientist to create descriptive images of molecules using various col- ors, tones, shadings, and line variations. As a result, one is able to view different aspects or domains of the specific proteins, each corresponding to a different structural man- ifestation or characteristic of the complex molecule. My research involves understanding the detailed mechanisms of binding between lipids and proteins. To provide meaningful information about the protein, the structure must be represented from various perspectives, using several different methods. Each of the pictures shown here gives different representations of the adipocyte-lipid binding protein containing stearic acid. One of the functions of the adipocyte-lipid binding protein is to act as a carrier of fatty acids within the cell. The struc- ture for the protein was retrieved from the Brookhaven Pro- tein Database, a public domain database that presently contains several thousand protein structures. The protein is first shown (fig. 1) as a solid, space- filled object, with the general shape of the protein visible. Shades of gray are used to represent different atom types (i.e., hydrogen carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen). The distinc- tion can even be more pronounced when various colors are used to represent the types of atoms. Figure 1 does not give any indication as to how the protein folds upon itself. Line variations in the way of a ribbon structure are used to show the tertiary or folded structure of proteins, as for the fatty acid protein (fig. 2). One can see that the protein has two alpha helices (on the left side of the figure) and many beta sheets, each connected by a turn.

A more detailed represen- tation of protein folding (fig. 3) shows the backbone atoms of the protein chain. This representation allows researchers to easily visualize hydrogen bonding on the protein structure. The ribbon structure in combination with information from backbone structure can present a clear view of how the protein is folded. A similar view of the pro- tein surrounded by a boundary of water molecules can be shown (fig. 4). Since water has profound influences on pro- tein structure and dynamic, it is important to include water molecules in modeling studies.

The molecular models shown here demonstrate that whereas artists work at portraying nature through their own eyes, scientists can present molecular images as they view them, via structure and function. I have portrayed only a static view of molecules in this short essay. Like so many other forms of nature, a constant state of flux exists within proteins. From these dynamic motions come further intri- cate patterns and structures that often alter the biological or physiological function of the molecule. Molecular mod- elers are also using similar strategies to show how unique regions of the protein can behave differently as a result of changes in their motion. _ ART JOURNAL 41</page><page sequence="10">Creating ArtScience TODD SILER D a eoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, is considered the master builder of life. Built into its constructions are the blueprints for building our constructions: from the trillions of cells that compose our bodies to the trillions of elaborate constructions our minds create by means of our bodies. Biochemists see this macromolecule, which lives in the central part of cells, as being solely responsible for the transmission of information-such as inherited character- istics-over generations. Anthropologists, however, see a different "macromolecule" that is responsible for the transformation of information-such as ideas, knowledge, and memories-within each generation. This other master molecule is "art and science," which lives in the nucleus of most cultures. 42 Both art and science are creative ways of under- standing the world and representing what we know. They show us how to search life for meaning; how to analyze our perceptions, experiences, and creations; how to communi- cate our personal and collective imaginings, while inspir- ing us to appreciate the depth and reach of our imaginations. Think about it: we could barely make sense of our world without these two unique forms of knowledge. Each offers a multitude of possibilities for enriching our lives. Each influences the shape and health of civilization. Both are as basic to our mental life as oxygen and water are to sustaining our physical life. Both are entwined in our being, in the same way the two strands of genetic material are twisted into the double helix of DNA, which carries our past and future in its strands spread throughout twenty- three chromosomes. ArtScience represents a new domain of communica- tion born from the integration of the arts and the sciences. It combines more than two million years of creative tenden- cies, inventions, languages, and explorations of the arts and sciences. ArtScience explores and recombines concepts, theories, models, and interpretations of nature in ways that resemble the exchange of genetic material between life- forms. In effect, it influences the evolution and heredity of ideas that are crucial to human development and survival. ArtScience is slowly transforming the physical, mental, and behavioral traits of the organism of art. ArtScience is to communication what breathing is to life and what genetics is to the creation of life. It's that cru- cial to living. Its ancient origin and evolution immediately tells us something about its sustained importance through- out time and its presence in the history of ideas. It remains the principal creative force shaping our world and realizing the human potential. Art is a complex living organism that naturally inter- Todd Siler, Origin of Metaspecies, 1992, mixed media on natural and synthetic paper, 82 x 100 inches. Courtesy Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York. acts with many other types of organisms, including the "multicellular" sciences, mathematics and technology. ArtScience is the operating environment that allows these organisms to flourish and evolve together. If we examined the nature of these "organisms," studying their physiology and anatomy, we would no doubt discover a similarity in their creative, evolutionary processes and "genetic make- up." Even though each of these organisms-art, science, mathematics, and technology-has its own languages and symbolic systems that it uses to communicate and explore the world, each can share its unique system of communica- tion in the course of interacting with other life-forms. And like genes, each has its own role in the evolution of ArtScience and in the growth of civilization. After we've finally fulfilled the dream of the Human Genome Project and its projective plans for recombinant DNA research-after breaching species barriers in creat- ing new life-forms-what will we do with our formidable knowledge? How will we wield our powers? Will we end up looking like amoebas, but thinking like gods? Or will we look like gods, but act like amoebas? This concern is expressed in my ArtScience work, titled Origin of Metaspecies. _ Statement on DNA as a Working Theme JUNE WAYNE In the late 1950s while I was drawing my Lemming Series (lemmings as a metaphor for people), press reports on the possibility of breaking the genetic code attracted my attention. Perhaps the code could explain why lemmings commit mass suicide every few years. Although I SPRING 1996</page><page sequence="11">June Wayne, Rosy's Helix (Genetic Code Series), 1970, four-color lithograph, 251/2 x 39 inches. Courtesy the artist. had no interest in illustrating science, by the late 1960s I was trying to draw the DNA molecule, cued by diagrams in Scientific American. Reviewing these drawings now, I see that the ones that came closest to the data were also the ones wherein my aesthetic intuition overrode the data. In Diktat, a multicolor lithograph of the early 1970s, I substituted my own symbols for DNA's alphabet. My derivative code floats within a double helix and includes a reference to RNA as well. Although the finished print resembles an Oriental rug and is quite ingenious, still it retained DNA data as part of its metaphor. Eventually I made images from which every shred of illustration had disappeared. My current work (The Djuna Set) might not have hap- pened had the DNA series not convinced me that molecu- lar anatomy is as much the province of the visual artist as is the anatomy of a deltoid muscle. I broadened my scope into quantum aesthetics (my term) so as to follow energy as it is expressed in tidal waves, earthquakes, magnetic fields, solar flares, and stellar winds. Thanks to Cal Tech and the Jet Propulsion Lab, I have been able to follow par- ticles as well as galaxies. Rosy's Helix is a tribute to Rosalind Franklin, the X- ray crystallographer who would have shared the Nobel Prize with Watson, Crick, and Wilkins had she not died at the age of thirty-seven. When I read The Double Helix, I was offended by Watson's sexist comments about Rosalind Franklin: nor did his feeble apology at the end of the book mollify me.1 Therefore it is ironic and embarrassing that I titled the print Rosys Helix: I didn't know that Franklin detested the nickname until I read, years too late, Ann Sayre's book Rosalind Franklin and DNA.2 _ Notes 1.
