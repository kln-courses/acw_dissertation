II. xi. 383. AMONG the many discoveries made by the Greek Archaeological Society at Mycenae in 1886 there is one which, for the student of primitive religion, possesses a quite exceptional interest-I refer to the strange fresco here reproduced (Fig. 1). It was recovered at the excavation of a chamber belonging to the oldest period. The fresco itself was found on a wall somewhat to the south of this chamber, but evidently connected with the FIG. 1. same group of buildings. M. Tsountas, the able director of the operations, describest it as eVpeOEv Ka'o wOrXo-ov 'z-oi, otKov-ovix Ev al"T'-7-wap~ Tt yedoio 6 dE poXtio80v ov n' a rX/a XouVT-pov.

On the head of the central figure may still be seen an excrescence of some sort, which probably denoted a tassel of the creature's hair: the ears slope backwards, and from their roots depends the rest of the animal's long tresses, which "are plaited; at least, this I take to be the meaning of the colours employed: they also wear a girdle about their loins. The bodies, including that of the central figure, are not preserved sufficiently to enable us to decide whether they are the bodies of beasts or of men. About the pole is wound a fillet; though its extremities, from which a pair of corresponding objects was probably hung, are now lost. The heads are not those of horses but of asses, as is evident from the long ears and the general outline of the mouth with its lips and nostrils.' As to the precise significance of these curious figures no very satis- factory conclusion has yet been reached. M. Tsountas himself, and indeed the majority of archaeologists, is content to refer to Dr. Milchhofer's work Die Anfdnge der Knnst in Griechenland as containing a sufficient explanation of the scene. The chapter in question deals with the so-called 'Island stones'; and in it the author seeks to prove that a large proportion of the subordinate Greek divinities,-including the Harpies, Winds, Gorgons, Centaurs, Satyrs and Sileni, as well as Demeter, Erinys, Pegasus, Areion, Iris, the Minotaur and the Dioscuri-all group themselves around the central figure of the Horse, and are in fact differentiations of that same primitive cult. Whether this is so or not, I shall endeavour to determine later on. For the present it is enough to point out that Dr. Milchhofer's essay deals only with the Horse,-he does not so much as mention the Ass ;- and therefore he can hardly be said to have provided a satisfactory solution of the picture before us. Since the discovery of this stucco-painting at Mycenae a very different explanation has been offered by Dr. Winter,2 who regards such figures as 'mistaken copies of the sacred Hippopotamus, the Egyptian goddess Thueris.'3 With this interpretation Dr. Walter Leaf 4 was formerly disposed to agree. But I would urge against it two objections. In the first place it is hard to see why her figure should have been thus repeated three times in a single scene. And in the second place we have direct evidence that Mycenaean art was much better acquainted with the shape of the hippopo- tamus than this theory would lead us to suppose. For among the terra- cotta vases found at Hissarlik in the ddbris of the second city (the Homeric Troy) were several in the form of animals, one of them giving a very fair idea of the hippopotamus.5 In short, though a single figure within the 2 Jahrbuch des K. d. Instituts, 1890, p. 108 (Arch. Anzeiger). 3 'The hippopotamus Ta-ur stood for a Typhonic or evil divinity, and was more an object to be prayed against than prayed to. Its temple was at Papremis. Naville calls it the emblem of impudence. Set took the body of a red hippopotamus.' J. Bonwick, Egyptian Belief, p. 227 fin. 4 Schliemann's Excavations, Eng. ed. 1891, p. 292, n. 1.

Admitting then that these figures are neither horses nor river-horses, but simply asinine,' we have to account for their peculiar appearance, and to offer some solution as to their significance. It will, I think, be well to remember two facts with regard to their provenance. They were discovered, as I have said, on the citadel of Mycenae; and connected with the spot where they were unearthed was a court-yard, which contained remains of an old sacrificial pit similar to the one disclosed at Tiryns by Dr. Dorpfeld. There is therefore a certain amount of '4 priori probability for attributing to them some religious meaning. Bearing this in mind, let us turn for a moment to another citadel of the Mycenaean civilization, the Akropolis at Athens. Here, in the days when 'the strong house of Erechtheus' was still standing, there was per- formed a ceremony which, thanks to scattered notices in the extant classics, can be partially reconstructed. It would appear that even in the time of Aristophanes girls between five and ten years of age were accustomed on certain occasions to celebrate a propitiatory rite in honour of Artemis Brauronia. This was done within the precinct of the Akropolis. Clad in saffron robes, which they afterwards presented to the goddess, they mimicked the action of bears (apKrcToea-Oat): indeed they were themselves called aip7cot and their festival 7a 4pK5crca. Further, it is possible that the saffron robes were the substitution of a more polished age for the rude bear-skins donned by less civilized worshippers.8 Applying this analogy to the case before us, we may maintain that there is no antecedent improbability against the prevalence of a similar ceremony at Mycenae. And if it could be shown that the ass was an animal ' See the Gazette Archdologiquc, 1888, P1. I. No. 6: Cesnola, Cyprus, p. 276: Perrot and Chipiez, History of Ancient Egyptian Art, Eng. ed. vol. i. p. 63, Fig. 42. An Egyptian picture of the 'Nilpferd' may be seen in Keller, op. cit. p. 206, Fig. 41. Even the Bushmen of S. Africa show greater skill in drawing this animal than Winter would allow the early Greeks ; ep. a cave-painting in A. Lang, Custom and Myth, p. 295, Fig. 9. 7 Mr. A. J, Evans writes to me that he is collecting fresh evidence against Winter's theory. M. Cavvadias, Fouilles de Lycosoura, Livr. i. )p. 12, n. 2, agrees with M. Tsountas in his in- terpretation : ' Les figures monstrueuses, peintes sur un fragment de stuc trouvi dans le palais de Mycenes, sont, h mon avis, des figures humaines i tate d'dne, vitues d'une tunique talaire.' Similarly Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'Art dans l'Antiuited, vol. vi. p. 885, 'Ceux-ci ont, sur un buste et avec des bras d'homme, des tetes d'ane.' s So A. Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, p. 213, n. 1 : 'The bear-skin seems later to have been exchanged for a saffron raiment.' This derives dubious support from a fragment of the figured peplos belonging to Damophon's group of Demeter, Despoina, Artemis, and Anutos; a female with the head of a bear dances in company with other animal forms. A parallel case would be Catlin's picture of the Indian bear-dance (pub. by Currier and Ives, New York), which shows a ring of warriors crouching like bears, some of them wearing bear-skin masks that conceal the whole head, and one a complete skin covering back, arms, and legs. I2</page><page sequence="4">84 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THlE MYCENAEAN AGE. likely to be worshipped by the early dwellers on the citadel, the details of our fresco would receive a clear and simple solution. For I would suggest that we have here a representation of three worshippers, dressed in asses' heads and skins, engaged in some religious function. The colouring of the skins which they wear on their backs shows them to have been some such conventional substitute as the KIpoIcoW-o at Athens.9 The girdle round the waist was used to attach the skins to their bare bodies; and the human head was probably covered by an artificial mask-this is indicated both by the flesh-tint of the face and by the two semi-circular marks under the jaw.10 Lastly, just as the dlpcrot were said" pvo-orjptov dyeetv, so here we may find an explanation of that curious old proverb B'vo4 dyet v',trmjpta. This interpretation of the painting is to some extent strengthened by a consideration of certain Island stones. There are at least three gems on which, if I have read them aright, we have scenes from the same ritual. Two out of these three were found in Crete; and though the exact source of the third is unknown, the Cretan goat upon it suggests the same island. FIG. 2. FIG. 4. FIG. 3. The first (Fig. 2) is a lenticular carnelian, now in the Berlin Museum.12 It affords in some respects the closest parallel to the Mycenaean fresco. A figure clothed in the head and skin of an ass bears on his shoulder a pole- presumably the io-tXa or vdhopov of Aristophanes, Frogs 813 --which he steadies with his right hand, the left not being shown. Froim the ends of this pole hang two slaughtered quadrupeds, 'due lioni o pantere uccisi,' according to Helbig. The pose of the arm, and the skin coat gathered in at the waist, recall the details of the larger drawing and raise a presumption that here too we have a similar scene portrayed. The second gem (Fig. 3), a lenticular chalcedony,14 repeats the motive. This time, however, as the victim is not so heavy, it is simply slung across the left shoulder. The girdle is ' p.

The third gem (Fig. 4), a glandular haematite, also in the Berlin Museum,15 represents the same figure once more with girdle and decorated skin, but in a different attitude. He is here in the act of presenting a sacred vessel; and this in all probability was another part of the same ritual, for it will be remembered that in M. Tsountas' account close to the fresco was found a strange dacyeyov EK /LoXtPo88v 'Xov orX^/za Xovrpo4. Thus far, then, assuming that the ass was the object of a special cult at Mycenae, we have found an explanation for the figures on the fresco that may at least be called consistent with the representations on the Island stones. But-it will be asked--are we justified in our assumption ? Have we a right to assign any religious importance to the ass ? Certainly with the Greeks as with other nations that animal was often cited merely as a symbol of stubbornness and stolidity. It is in this character only that Homer, for example, mentions it.16 Hence too come such proverbs as oPvT rTV 'Kere ti/0ov or 65vo iveTrat. And Horapollo, whose ignorance of hieroglyphics does not preclude his acquaintance with Hellenic custom, informs us 17 that the Egyptians 'portray with the head of an ass' the man who has never left his own land, as being one who has no turn for enquiry and knows nothing of foreign travel. Cornelius de Pauw, commenting on sundry interpretations of that passage, remarks :l 'Asininum caput pro capite humano sumtum loco symboli, ad denotandam hominis stupiditatem. Hoc aptum. Alia non sunt unius assis.' But dc priori argument provokes a priori answer : '"The gods ? What and where are they ?" What my sire supposed, And where yon cloud conceals them! "Till they 'scape And scramble down to Leda, as a swan, Europa, as a bull! why not as--ass To somebody ? "' Aristophanes' Apology, p. 87. At any rate it will be worth while to ask whether ancient mythology attached any peculiar significance to the ass, and if so, how far such significance will explain the details and accessories of our problematic painting. Now the fact that among Eastern nations the ass possesses a dignity which his Western congener has lost prepares us to learn that in the 5 Milchhifer, op. cit. p. 68, Fig. 46a: Mitchell, op. cit. p. 147, Fig. 72: see also Helbig, Bull. 1875, p. 41, and Overbeck, Gr.

Rigvedas he is invested with supernatural powers,1' appearing now as a demi-god, now as a semi-demon. He is on the one hand a victorious warrior,20 terrifying men with his discordant voice,21 and endowed with generative strength beyond his compeers.2 On the other hand his demoniacal aspect is also prominent :23 he dwells in the darkness of a cavern or the gloom of Ifell, 'and this cavern and hell sometimes assume the form of an ass's skin, or of an ass simply.' 24 The conception of the celestial ass as a great warrior was naturally confined to those countries in which the tertestrial ass was employed in war. Aelian, for example, makes the following statement: 25 Zapado pot Se ore ax'olopovg, ofre dXovvraav eXovo 70"roWv vovo, aXXa 7roXE/10aTr KIca&amp; e7r aTrCv 7ye rTOVS evorXlovqe icVovVV' rrorJovov-cl", (or7repovv o0 "EXXrlve9 E 'r\tT r V 7r(OV. o-7tV 8'  apa 7rap' avrotv Vov, y7Ic)o~ TE0rpo , elvat oS0e, ro7G7ro 7" "Apet 7rpoo-afyovo-tl tepoh.- and Strabo says 2 of the Carmanians: Xpc&amp;Vata 08' Ovo t 0o XX0ol, Icat 7rPwo 7edTepo/v aoat'vet 'T" J It'7rr(w vov Te Oovo-t 7 "Ape, v7rep Icatl -aeourat Oewv , dvov, Kal tel-t r7oXepto-raTa,- adding that when Darius attacked the Scythians, his contingent of asses proved most effective in routing the enemy's cavalry- WoXXcv &amp;8 6 E7reXavvduTovw V 70rto llEpo-a, tperatf) oxc axovo-eLtav ot 7twr ot rov ,ovv, 'T ov,7, E'Tapado-aouro. The few traces of the warrior ass that occur in classical literature may be collected here. Eratosthenes27 relates that in the Gigantomachia, when Zeus summoned all the gods to the rescue, Dionysus, Hephaestus, and the Satyrs, came riding upon asses, which, though frightened them- selves, so alarmed the giants by their braying that the battle was won."2 19 De Gubernatis, Zoological Mythology, vol. i. p. 364. 20 Rigveda I. xxxiv. 9, Trans. Prof. H. H. Wilson, vol. i. p. 96, ' When will be the har- nessing of the powerful ass, that you may come to the sacrifice ?' i.e. the ass was the steed of the Asvins. 21 .Rigveda I. xxix. 5, Trans. Prof. H. H. Wilson, vol. i. p. 74, 'Indra, destroy this ass, (our adversary), praising thee with such dis- cordant speech ; and do thou, Indra, of bound- less wealth, enrich us with thousands of excel- lent cows and horses.' 22 The Aitareya Brahmanam of the Rigveda, Trans. Martin Haug, vol. ii. p. 273 = Ait. Br. IV. ii. 9, 'The Asvins were the winners of the race with a carriage drawn by donkeys; they obtained (the prize). Thence (on account of the excessive efforts to arrive at the goal) the donkey lost its (original) velocity. . . . The Aivins, however, did not deprive the sperm of the ass of its (primitive) vigour. This is the reason that the male ass (vjil) has two kinds of sperm (to produce mules from a mare, and asses from a female ass).' 23 Ramayana ii. 71, Trans.

Buhle.</page><page sequence="7">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 87 Pausanias (X. xviii. 4) informs us that the Ambrakiots dedicated an ass of bronze in gratitude for a night-victory over the Molossians, in which the foe had been routed by a timely bray. Similarly in Aesop's fable of the Ass and the Lion as partners in the chase, ' auritulus Clamorem subito totis tollit viribus Novoque turbat bestias miraculo.' PHAEDRUS I. xi. 6. Lastly 29 Pliny mentions 30 the superstition that 'pellis asini iniecta im- pavidos infantes facit.' As an intermediate link between Eastern and Western mythology we have the Phrygian legend of Midas. This somewhat complex tale represents Midas as the king and forefather of the Phrygian people. In his childhood ants conveyed grains of corn into his mouth,31 indicating-says Cicero "- that one day he would become the richest of all men. During the progress of Dionysus from Thrace to Phrygia Silenus strayed into his rose-gardens, and bound with wreaths of flowers was brought before him. Midas received the delinquent kindly; and Dionysus in return granted his request that whatever he touched should become gold-a favour that the king was soon glad to have cancelled. It is fiurther stated . that Midas belonged to a race of Satyrs. Being visited by one of his kinsmen, who with voice and flute ridiculed him on account of his Satyr's ears, Midas mixed wine in a well, induced his detractor to drink, and so caught him. This well was still shown at Ancyra in Pausanias' time,34 though others maintained that the true spot was near Thymbrium."1 Better known is the story which tells how Apollo, angered because Midas preferred Pan's piping to his own harping, changed the ears of the monarch into those of an ass. For a while Midas concealed them under his Phrygian cap. But at length the servant who cut his hair discovered them, and-being unable to keep silence-dug a hole in the ground, into which he whispered the fatal news. The hole was filled up; but reeds springing from the spot betrayed the secret as they rustled in the wind. These are the main incidents of the Midas myth. It must not ot course be treated after the manner of the later mythographers as necessarily a consistent whole. But inasmuch as it regards the figure of the ass-king under several different aspects, it will form a convenient starting-point from 29 Epictetus ace. Arrian (Ep. Diss.

(1) In the first place, then, we note a certain connection-whether positive or negative-between the ass and music. The Satyr derides Midas oz'p vov OVv 8oXXh ica ac hawv. And it is for his lack of muisical taste that Apollo imposes the ' auriculas asini.' Elsewhere we learn that the ass was sacrificed to Apollo; Pindar speaking of the Hyperboreans says: 36 7rap' o Tv 7rE IaepCi Ee alcaTo Xayeas9, &amp;opaT' de'XoeX'd, IXeTaLr o v o v KcaTro,3aq 7r1Toaav" Oed, '?ovTrav 6v w aXlav e/pJeTov Xatpet, yeX~z 8' pov i;pp/v 3pliav Kcvow8av.

Antoninus Liberalis is more circumstantial.

However, before they died, Apollo at the request of Leto and Artemis tera/aaXaOv edrolnre r7rcvra9 opvt0av.39 Despite Apollo's predilection for the Hyper- borean breed there was an annual sacrifice of asses at Delphi: this we gather from an important inscription 40 in which occurs the line- v 6pvov xpov at r tlepia dlOp6a avvary6vTrov , ro~ o vo v , 41v TOP Ltpa... Emendations have been proposed ; but Boeckh's comment is just : 'de asinis non est quod dubites; non Graeci Hyperboreos fecissent Apollini asinorum hecatomben offerentes, nisi in Graecia quoque asini mactati Apollini essent.' It may be plausibly conjectured that, just as in the Vedic hymn 'the god Indras...is requested by the poet to kill the ass who sings with horrible 36 Pyth. x. 31 ff. 37 Cohortatio ad Gentes, vol. i. col. 101, ed.

A striking illustration is supplied by a mosaic at Palermo4 which repre- sents Orpheus playing, and among the animals listening to him even an ass. There is therefore a certain amount of evidence for supposing that the ass was traditionally deficient in musical skill. I am, however, inclined to suspect that this deficiency was not primitive, but an effect of later ration- alism. Indeed the early mind would be far more likely to consider the ass a great vocalist than to reflect that the notes he produced were harsh and discordant. It is as a popular critic of music that Aesop, for example, makes him judge the contest between the nightingale and the cuckoo; and a genuine love for singing may be detected in his endeavour to imitate the 41 De Gubernatis, op. cit. vol. i. p. 374. 42 Roscher, Lex. col. 435, 40-1. 43 Paroemiog.

The ass was a Typhonic animal, and in certain religious cere- monies the people of Coptus sacrificed asses by casting them down a precipice, while those of Lycopolis, in two of their annual feasts, stamped the figure of a bound ass on their sacrificial cakes. . . . It has been supposed that the Golden Set, worshipped by the Semite Hyksos in the Delta, was a Sun-god.' It was, by the way, an Egyptian grammnarian-Apion by name-who first promulgated the tale that the Jews wor- shipped an ass's head of gold in the temple at Jerusalem. 49 Arch.

Phaedrus and the later fabulists adopt the less naive view:- 'Asinus iacentem vidit in prato lyram. Accessit et temptavit chordas ungula; Sonnere tactae. Bella res, sed mehercules Male cessit, inquit, artis quia sum nescius. Si repperisset aliquis hanc prudentior, Divinis aures oblectasset cantibus.' PHAEDR. App. xii. But to find the ass as a veritable musician we must go back to the East. In the fifth book of the Pantchatantra50 the ass Ouddhata plays truant along with a jackal. Turning a deaf ear to the arguments and entreaties of the latter he insists upon singing, having first proved his minute and accurate knowledge of musical laws: 'Apres que cela fut fait, I'ane tendit son cou et se mit a crier. Puis le garde des champs, quand il entendit le cri de l'ane, gringa les dents de col6re, prit un baton et accourut. Lorsqu'il aperqut l'ane, il lui donna tant de coups de baton, que Ouddhata, accabl6 de coups, tomba a terre.' Again, this animal has been identified 11 with the Vedic 'gandharvas,' who amongst other offices taught music and dancing to the gods.52 Now Prof. Kuhn holds that these 'gandharv's' are, both in name and nature, the Oriental counterpart of the Hellenic Icrvravpot.53 Possibly therefore the Centaurs, who in Greek legend and Greek art are constantly represented as teaching or playing instruments of music, were originally asses. On migrating westwards to a land where the Eastern ass was largely replaced by the horse, their mythical ?'rle was to some extent transferred to the latter animal. However popular tradition kept as a collateral type the older asinine beings, calling them ,voK,viavpot to distinguish them from the usurping 17r'tro~,vravpot. They are described by Hesychius 54 as-TrpxtLve.ev', 8atLpoov Crt YEVO, eoavXov X ai aKo-OrEv T77 errutavelta-and more in detail by Krates.55 (2) A second 56 trait in the Midas legend connects the ass-king with corn and wine. When a child, ants convey grains of corn into his mouth. 50 Pantchatantra V. vii. Trans. E. Lancereau, p. 330 if. A very similar tale occurs in the Tofiti-Nameh (ed. Rosen, ii. 218), a collection of Oriental myths translated from the Turkish version. Benfey in his Einleitung to the Pantchatantra (? 188, p. 463) regards this as the source of the proverb ' Asinus ad lyram.' 5' De Gubernatis, op. cit. vol. i. p. 365. 52 Monsieur H. Fauche in vol. ii. p. II. of his Trans. of the Ramayana describes the Gandharvas as ' musiciens c6lestes, Demi-Dieux, qui habi- tent le ciel d'Indra et composent l'orchestre h tous les banquets des principales Divinites,' " See E.

He captures the Satyr by mixing wine in a well. These are but slight indications of a wide-spread symbolism. For the ass is regularly associated with the worship of Demeter and Dionysus.

And a terra-cotta from Athens, now in the British Museum,5s shows the scene: an ass carries certain sacrificial objects, among which are apparently a fish and a ram's head. Dionysus often employs the ass as a means of transport. In Aristid. Dion. i. 49 we read: ica't ~6vatT' av Icat bvovw 7rTCepolv (0 Atd6vvao) o~ X irrovw lavov.

Inghirami 62 mentions several analogous vases; and Mionnet 63, * describes coins of Mende and Nakona, which represent the wine-god mounted on or attended by an ass. The example set by Dionysus was followed by his satellites. Athenaeus (v. 196 ff.) describes a Dionysiac procession in the time of Ptolemy II at which hundreds of Sileni and Satyrs were carried by asses. Indeed Silenus is commonly "5 represented as riding 'pando asello'; and in the collection at Marbury Hall (Cheshire) is a small marble group of a Satyr on an ass, from the Villa Mattei: nor can we forget the Xanthias of the Frogs. A Bacchant rides the same beast in Miiller-Wieseler, Denkmailer ii. no. 576, Inghirami, Vasi Fittili, vol. iii. pl. CCLX, and elsewhere.66 Similar scenes are sometimes portrayed on sepulchral double reference distinguishes a carnelian in the Vidoni collection (Wieseler, Denkmdiler, ii. no. 513): in front of a rock on which is a small shrine of Dionysus or Priapus sits a Silenus playing the lyre, while an ass accompanies the music with his brays. 57 ed.

A sarcophagus in the Berlin Museum shows a crowd of Bacchants and Sileni drawn by a pair of asses, stumbling under the load. Otto Benndorf, who discusses this 'argumentum' in the Arch. Zeit. for 1864,67 quotes two parallels: one from a sarcophagus in Paris, on which a number of Erotes are shown playing with Dionysiac animals-three of them being drawn in a car by a pair of asses: and a second from a sarcophagus-frieze in the Vatican, where several Bacchic revellers are similarly escorted. Of Lityerses, another harvest divinity, it is said on the authority of Sositheos the tragedian:_-0 "EOaOets /p avo'T" r'pet ovov10 KavOyXlovq T7ptl wT fIfpaXetaq ipepa- 7rivers ' ga KaXiCv E6TpTpv TOV Se&amp;daipopov wrltov. But if the ass be thus appropriated to the service of the corn-deities, it might be argued that we have here on Greek soil an instance of the corn- spirit being represented-as it was represented elsewhere 9--by an ass. A clearer example of this is the Roman custom of leading in procession an ass decked with loaves of bread and flowers.

After telling the Ovidian story he continues, ' Hac de causa Lampsacenos asellum Priapo, quasi in ultionem, mactare consuevisse; apud Romanos vero eumdem Vestalibus sacris in honorem pudicitiae conservatae panibus coronari.' 67 Vol. xxii.

I have already observed that this side of his nature was prominent in the Hindoo mythology: and traces of the same are not wanting in Greece and Italy. Lactantius in the chapter quoted above comments on a phallic contest between the ass and Priapus.75 Plutarch in answer to the question 7 T1i 4 7raph Kvptalotv ,vo3'dret4; describes a custom observed till within recent times in some parts of Europe; T7Cov yvUatKc&amp;ov T77v, '7 ' LXE IC o xea l o-av b anrayOdv7E El dyopda...ave/i/a'oii 7r ' ivov, Kcat Tnv 7r6XtL IKVcKX) 7reptaX etfo-av...0`voe1TtVl 7rpoo-ayopevoe/oVv.

Again, the priests of Cybele-the Galli-made their drums of asses' skins.87 Palladius preserves a curious piece of superstition which bears on the point; seed sown may be kept from harm by putting up an ass's skull as a scare-crow.7" 'Item equae calvaria sed non virginis intra hortum ponenda est, vel etiam asinae.

Finally, it is on. this aspect of the asinine nature that the entire plot of Apuleius' novel 'The Golden Ass' is based. The hero, one Lucius, is owing to the magic ointment of his mistress transformed into an ass (Bk. iii.). After passing through sundry striking adventures, he at length regains his human shape by dint of eating rose-leaves (Bk. xi.). The whole tale is, except for the famous inter- lude of Cupid and Psyche, a mere expansion of Lucian's story AoVK?co i Ovov, where the hero bears the same name, undergoes the same meta- morphosis, and meets with much the same adventures. Among his numerous escapes is one occasion on which he carries off a certain virgin from a band of robbers; they are recaptured, and the robbers propose to punish them by sewing up the virgin in the skin of the ass Lucius, her face alone being left visible.85 (3) Thirdly,86 the Midas-myth displays some touches of Chthonic import. The Satyr was caught by wine mixed in a well, which well was afterwards claimed by the people of different localities. The attendant, too, who dis- covered the secret, dug a hole in the ground and buried it there: ' secedit, humumque Effodit, et, domini quales aspexerit aures, Voce refert parva terraeque inmurmurat haustae; Indiciumque suae vocis tellure regesta Obruit, et scrobibus tacitus discedit opertis.' OVID, Met. xi. 185-9. With regard to this underground affinity, it will be remembered that in the Hindoo poems the ass dwells in the darkness of a cavern or the gloom of hell. Greek mythology preserves the tradition. Aristophanes more than once mentions a certain gnome or goblin called "Epwrrovo-a, and the scholiast on two passages 87 remarks that she is known also as 'Ov6aoceXLv or 'Ov0icwXoq. Eustathius, commenting on Od. xi. 634 j pot Popyeiv iKceaXj v Kc.r.X., makes the following statement: 'Persephone sends a Gorgon-head to terrify men just as Hekate sends Empusa. For Empusa, they say, is a demoniacal phantom sent by Hekate, which some call 'Ov6KicXLv and others 'OvdacesXCv.' In the Tagenistae ' (firag. 426) Aristophanes goes so far as to identify Empusa with s5 Similarly in Perrault's Popular Tales (ed. A. Lang, pp. 83-105) the princess Peau-d'Asne to escape the importunities of the king dons this strange disguise:-- ' Pour vous rendre miconnaissable La dipoiiille de l'Asne est un masque admirable ; Cachez-vous bien dans cette peau, On ne croira jamais, tant elle est effroyable, Qu'elle renferme rien de beau.' 86 Again, a connecting link between the phallic and the chthonic nature of the ass is not absent. Plutarch (Parallela 29) claims the authority of Aristotle for his statement that a certain misogynist b'Sv(e IU-YEO -ro arh Xpd4YOV &amp;EKE K o'ptV E?)LE8EtTahd , 'OVd0KELAv TouvoLa.

The former was wont to appear in many shapes, one of which was that of a mule and a second that of a woman."8 Lucian, relating an adventure supposed to have befallen him on a certain small island, says:" 89'I then saw that the legs were not those of a woman, but the hoofs of an ass ...And she, sorely against her will, admitted that her tribe consisted of ladies of the sea called 'OvooiceX'at, and that they were accustomed to devour such strangers as came to their coasts.' The Chthonian 90 character of the ass finds further support in the legend of Tages as told by Cicero in his de Divin. II. xxiii. 50,- 'Tages quidam dicitur in agro Tarquiniensi, quum terra araretur, et sulcus altius esset impressus, exstitisse repente et eum affatus esse, qui arabat.' For among other deeds this 'terrae filius' taught men to preserve their crops from blight by fastening up the skull of an Arcadian ass- 'Hine caput Arcadici nudum cute fertur aselli Tyrrhenus fixisse Tages in limite ruris.' COLUMELLA x. de cult. hort. vv. 344-5. It is perhaps as a Chthonian animal that the ass possesses oracular powers.

And in his Life of Alexander an ass which kills a favourite lion with a kick is accounted an evil omen. Such superstitions lasted on into mediaeval times. Johannes Sarisberiensis mentions the ass as a 'Wegthier,' which it is unlucky to meet.9" The most satisfactory evidence on the point is, however, the occurrence of the ass as a stock denizen of the underworld.

Pausanias' interpretation, whatever its source may be, seems based on the phallic nature of the ass. But the reference to a particular man Oknos and the moralizing turn given to the whole indicate the invention of an age that had half-forgotten the meaning of its mythology. A safer conclusion may be reached from a consideration of the company in which Oknos and his ass are found. Baumeister reproduces 9 the sculptured mouth of a Roman spring, which shows Oknos plaiting his rope and the ass devouring it; behind the animal stands a Danaid with a water-pot on her head. Another illustration was published by Campana'94 in 1841 from the frieze of a Roman tomb: Oknos and his ass are here put into a division of the painting separate from, but adjacent to, that of the Danaids. A third re- presentation 9' was found in 1.832 on the frieze of a Columbarium near the Porta Latina: the Danaids are no longer visible, unless the female figure to 91 Hopf, Thierorakel utnd Orakelthiere, pp. 30, 75. 92 ifr. Frazer tells me that the tale 'occurs in one of the Buddhist Jatakas, with the substitu- tion of a jackal for the ass (Folklore, i. 1890, p. 409).' This variation is not unique. De Gubernatis, Zoological Mythology, vol. ii. p. 126, relates the Hindoo myth of the jackal who 'passes himself off as a peacock of the sky. The animals make him their king, but he be- trays himself by his voice. . ... This is a variety of the ass dressed in the lion's skin.' 93 Denkmndilr, vol. iii. p. 1925, Fig. 2041: Visconti, MIus'e Pie- Clmentin, 1820, vol. iv. P1.

In a fourth picture, drawn by Visconti 96 from the bas-relief on a round marble altar, Oknos twisting a rope and his ass grazing occur in company with the Danaids and their rrltos TreTrpywEvo9v. Finally, Oknos and the ass occupy the whole scene on a wall- painting from the Columbarium of the Villa Pamfili."7 So far all has been correct, conventional, Roman. Oknos and his ass are stereotyped figures traditionally associated with the daughters of Danaus. If an older version of the myth is extant, it must be sought among the treasures of Greek ceramic. Now an archaic black-figured vase in the Munich Museum 98 represents four winged e''8wXa KatvproiW emptying pitchers into an enormous jar sunk in the earth. Their characteristics as Danaids are at a minimum, and-were it not for the statements of later mythographers-they would have been compared to the souls of the departed as shown on the Greek funeral jars. The explanation thus hinted at is confirmed by a lekythos " found in a grave near Monte Saraceno, and now in the Museum at Palermo. This most instructive picture is apparently conceived in a spirit of caricature: it repre- sents men and women hastening in comic attitudes to empty amphorae into a huge vessel. The vessel disappears behind the figure of an ass, which is kicking lustily as one of the male water-bearers plucks its tail. In front of the ass sits a man looking in a distressed way at four lines-possibly strands of a rope.100 Here at least it is evident that the water-carriers are not Danaids, or not Danaids alone. They recall Pausanias' description (X. xxxi. 9-11) of the figures at Delphi:-- a .

The design is, however, somewhat fragmentary, and their absence cannot be proved. 98 Inghirami, Vasi fittili, ii. 135 : Panofka, M1us. Blacas, Pl.

In short, it seems highly probable that the Danaid myth originated in the belief that those who did not take part in a certain mystic 6Spocopia on earth would hereafter be condemned to it as a perpetual punishment. But-it may be asked-what has all this to do with the ass ? How is it that Oknos and his beast are associated with these XovTpo6pot ? Two answers to this question suggest themselves. On the one hand the water- bearers of the lower world are probably engaged in the Xovrpocpfpoa XXtLS of Euripides Phoen. 348, the well-known marriage ceremony, which they have neglected during their lifetime : and we have already seen the ass symbolizing sexual relations. That a phallic animal should appear in such company is surely more than a mere coincidence. On the other hand the ass was traditionally connected with water in general, and the water of the underworld in particular. How that connection arose we have no means of determining. It may have been strengthened by the employment of the ass as a water-carrier; 101 and by the observation that it commonly avoids treading in water,102 being, as Aristotle says,103 4rvxpbv coov...~8o-ptyov 7"rv Qpt o-tv. At any rate it is certain that Hellenic supersti- tion did associate the ass with water.'04 Plutarcho?0 seeks to explain the alleged 101 Athen. 456E-457A. 1o2 Pliny, N.H. viii. 169.

The ass of three feet stands in the midst of the sea of Varkash; and water of every kind, which rains on a corpse, and the menstrual discharge, and the remaining corrup- tion and putridity, when it arrives at the ass of three feet, with watchfulness he makes every kind clean and pure.' This 'Khar i se pae' (three-legged, i.e. lame, ass) is further described in the Bundehesh (xliv. 4-xlv. 19 = ch. xix. of Ferdinand Justi's trans.) which observes that, among other peculiarities, the three-legged ass has a horn of gold wherewith he demolishes the animosity of all evil monsters. In the Zendic Yacna, xli. 28, 'by braying he terrifies the monsters and prevents them from con- taminating the wvater' (De Gub. op. cit. i. 379 : ed. Spiegel, p. 169). Again, the Kharmnthi (Ass-fish) is 'the chief of water creatures and fish, ten of whom . . . swim around the Himn tree' (Mainyo-i-Khard, ed. West, p. 124). 105 Symp. iv.

Aelian 107 relates the fable-be- longing to the Promethean cycle-of the ass, which desires to drink at a snake-guarded fountain and pacifies its protector by means of a dpdpLaKov yrOppw 4JaVvTrj7pov. It was indeed customary among the Greeks to have drinking-vessels shaped like an ass's head.10s In the second Vase-room of the British Museum 109 is an archaic Kantharos, the form of which is merged in that of an ass's or mule's head; it is decorated with a painting of Dionysus astride a mule, attended by Satyrs and Maenads. This seems the prototype of the later forms.110 In the third Vase-room 11 is a fine sample of the rhyton shaped like the head of an ass or mule. And in Vase-room four is a similar, though poorer, specimen adorned not inappropriately with a figure of Eros. But especially was the ass connected with under'ground waters. I have already alluded to the well of king Midas and to the orifice of a Roman spring. References of a more directly Chthonian character are to hand.

The two stogries are but different modes of expressing the same idea. Those who on earth have deferred (6Kve-v) initiation into the mysteries of a certain hydrophoria, o0 obz t1ueuv)6yvoEt, are after death condemned to be ever pouring their jars into a well that is never satisfied. In symbolic language, Pro- crastination ("OlvoS) must constantly feed the Ass of the nether waters. But why feed him in this peculiar fashion ? Why make him swallow a rope for all eternity ? Not, I think, because the rope signifies the endless generations of men; 117 nor because the tuv80orotd6 has misread the uvlloypadov; 11s but for the simple reason that the ass denotes the well, and that when the bucket is lowered into it, the ass is said to swallow the rope.119 Having completed this survey of the symbolic meanings attached by the Greeks to the figure of the ass, we are now in a position to settle the significance of the fresco from Mycenae. We have seen the ass on Greek soil (1) as a musician, (2) as a servant of the harvest-gods with phallic aptitudes, and (3) as representing the waters of the underworld. To which of these aspects can we refer the Mycenaean figures ? Topographical considerations suggest the last. Mycenae is about twenty miles from Lake Stymphalus, and thirty from Pheneos where 120 the 7/vyJ v8cop took its rise. Plutarch's legend that this water could only be held by a orhvX 'vov accords well with the 68popopla represented on the Berlin haematite (p. 84), Helbig's 'pezzo oblongo di metallo' (Bull. 1875, p. 41), which shows an ass-figure in the act of carrying a sacred vessel: it also explains the bowl found near the fresco on the citadel. To determine the exact nature of the ceremony is at present impossible in view of our limited data. But the fact that the b6popopia at which Oknos and his beast assisted was almost 116 Miss J. E. Harrison, Myths of the Odyssey, J). 90, P1. XXVI.a, gives a Roman design from the tomb of Quintus Naso on the Via Flaminia, representing Hades, in which 'one soul in the form of an ass is drinking the waters of Lethe.' This has, however, been interpreted as a nmetemnpsychosis-scene. 117 As Bachofen, op cit., suggests. 11s Miss Harrison, in lecturing on Greek vase- painting at Cambridge some years ago, sug- gested that the rope was originally used by Oknos to drag the ass after him, the notion about the ass swallowing it being a mere mis- understanding. I suspect that this explana- tion of myth-making by means of graphic mis- interpretation is being carried too far. 119 Asia possible survival of this primitive belief, I would call attention to the design on an ass-head rhyton in the British Museum (Vase-room III., case 42, no. E 477), mentioned above. It is a fine specimen of polychrome Hellenic pottery, belonging to the best period (B.C. 440-330). On the upper part of the animal's head are painted two draped figures: the one holds a rope, and behind the other is a well-pulley. If, as seems probable, the designs on these rhytons may have reference to their animal shape, it would appear that on this vase we have a reminiscence of the ass in its char- acter as a well-daemon. 11.2 Aelian, de Nat. Anim. x. 40.</page><page sequence="21">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 101 certainly a bridal rite raises a presumption that the action of the Mycenaean asses had a kindred significance. Again, the o'voL Kepaco-'poL of Aelian (p. 99) and Philostratos, and the golden horn of the three-legged ass in the Bundehesh (p. 98, n. 104), remind us that in the Mycenaean painting there is an excrescence between the ears of the asinine heads,121-and serve to strengthen our case, inas- much as the horned ass is everywhere associated with the nether waters. Another point in the picture becomes clear when viewed in this connec- tion. Over the shoulders of the asinine figures passes a twisted rope, which they are grasping with their right hands. Archaeologists, misled by the analogy of the 'vd'opov, have called this 'a pole used to carry the spoils of the chase'; 122 but the markings clearly indicate a rope. It may perhaps be a representation of the well-rope, the ilovPhL of the later 123 Greeks, which would naturally enter into any ritual connected with a well. Whether the rite here enacted had reference to the celebrated spring at Mycenae, known as Perseia,124 must remain uncertain. I should, however, point out that it very possibly gave rise to the K6p8a? dance of after times. The passages descriptive of that dance are collected by Blaydes on Aristophanes' Clouds, 537. I notice four points of resemblance between it and the fresco in dispute:- (i.)

The rope plays a prominent part in both.

And Harles (ed. Ar.

Terence (Adelphi, IV. vii. 34) 121 A similar excrescence occurs on the ass- head rhytons in the British Museum. It is, I think, merely-as M. Tsountas suggested- , a tassel of the creature's hair': the special sanctity assigned to it will be explained later (page 122f.). 122 Schuchhardt, op. cit. p. 292: cp. Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'Art, vol. vi. p. 885, 'une longue perche.' Since writing the above I find that M. Paul Girard, in his book La Peinture Antique (p. 99), published the year before last, also takes this to be a rope. 23 Herondas v. 11, ' v ~uavc4pOPv oT 70K dccov.

(iii.) Prof. Percy Gardner 127 observes: ' The ancients regarded the dance cordax as imported into Greece from Phrygia by Pelops.' Now the ass-king was according to the legend (p. 87) forefather of the Phrygians: and that Phrygian influence in general was strong at Mycenae is abundantly manifest. (iv.) Both the cordax-dance and the Mycenaean mummery appear to partake of a religious and perhaps phallic character. The upright pose and lolling tongues of the asses on the fresco are aptly described by the i'/ppi opOla K1voodawv in which Apollo delights. And an inscription 12s has been found within the walls of Apollo's temple at Minoa, which mentions /c6p~a/ce&amp; in honour of that god.129 'Am/aO qTvXn] oil [1cop~aKo--ra[t jI T(Af7rEp]' t TOl) H,1e- I [oov] 'A~r6XXcova /cop-I &amp;ICv 1 ' paCWEp 0 , -EL I [...o]v, ,nXoo- "a- I-TO), ECi- I j[Epye"Tlg,] Xopnyy oav- [Ta]...... A detail that still calls for explanation is the fact that on two at least of the Island stones the ass-figures have the legs of lions. This combination will however, become more intelligible when we have discussed the nature of the leonine cult (see p. 119f.). For the present I merely note that it is by no means unique, and will be found to support that connection between the ass and the water of the underworld, which is illustrated by both the fresco and the gems. This much at least we may claim to have rendered probable: that on the citadel of Mycenae and also in the island of Crete there existed in pre-Homeric times the cult of a Chthonian deity-a well-spirit-conceived as embodied in the form of an ass. The devotees of this deity were wont to dress themselves in artificial masks and skins, thereby symbolizing their relationship to him.130 Their ritual involved on the one hand a mystic hydrophoria-perhaps a marriage custom-and on the other a ceremonial rope-dance.131 127 NCew Chapters in Greek History, p. 82. Cp. the Delphin Terence, vol. ii. p. 765 n.:- 'Lusus est natus, ut refert Donatus, ab eo fune, quo equus ligneus Graecorum in Troiam introductus est.' 128 Boeckh, C.LG. vol. ii. p. 1035, No. 2264, o. 129 With this we should compare the 'Apr~elts KopdaKa at Elis (Paus. VI. xxii. 1). The adop- tion of such a rope-dance by these deities may be explained by the principle of 'contaminatio,' though Artemis at least has distinct claims to be considered as a 'Quell- und Fluss-gottin' (Roscher, Lex. coll. 559-561). 13' 'The ordinary meaning of skin-wearing in early religion is to simulate identification with the animal whose skin is worn.' Prof. Robert- son Smith, The Religion of the Semites, p. 454. 11 Another Cretan rope-dance connected with animal worship may underlie the legend of the Minotaur. Benndorf supposes that the famous 'clue' was the rope used in the Xopo's of Ariadne (II. xviii. 590).</page><page sequence="23">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 103 II.-THE CULT OF THE LloN. a'Urr &amp;nr-ovu Xeatva. AESCH. Agamn. 1258. In the preceding section I have dealt with a figure that appears comparatively seldom in the art-remains of the Mycenaean epoch. Far more frequent is the representation of a fiercer animal, the lion; so frequent indeed that one cannot help suspecting the existence of some symbolical association to account for its constant recurrence. But here caution is needed. For most nations in their earliest artistic efforts have shown a taste and a talent for animal life: and it is certain that down to quite classical times lions survived in the more desolate parts of the Greek peninsula. Pausanias 132 speaks of them as still to be found in Thrace. Herodotus 133 mentions them in Macedonia; Aristotle,134 in the region lying between the rivers Achelous and Nessus. At a remote date they must have been more widely distributed -witness the legends of formidable lions at Megara, Nemea, and Mount Olympus. Again, the history of Greek Archaeology should warn us that esoteric meaning is not to be imported into scenes of a simple and natural character unless circumstances not only justify but render strictly necessary such procedure. Nevertheless it may fairly be doubted whether-even as early as B.C. 1400-the lion was sufficiently common in Greece and the Archipelago to warrant its persistent use as a motive for all decorative purposes. And the conjecture of an underlying religious cause rises into certainty when we consider some clearer claims to symbolism, which have recently come to light. In the first rank of importance must be placed the fragments of a bronze bowl, brought by Cesnola from Cyprus, and now in the New York Museum. They comprise a rim and two handles attached to it, all being neatly decorated with repoussd designs. Round the rim runs a row of oxen, apparently pursued by a lion. On each handle are three povwpdvla, and above them six lion-like figures arranged in pairs. These figures stand upright facing one another in heraldic fashion (Fig. 5): they bear in their hands pitchers, and seem to be wearing a kind of ornamental back-covering or cloak, which at once recalls the garb of the Mycenaean asses. It has been held by M. Perrot 135 that 'ce sont des lions, mais qui portent sur le dos une peau de poisson, comme le dieu assyrien Anou .... On 132 Paus. VI. v. 4.

Similarly M. E. Babelon'36 says: 'ce sont des lions, debout sur leurs pattes de derriere, tenant des cenochods, et vetus d'une peau de poisson, comme le dieu Anou dans la symbolique assyro-chaldcenne.' But, though it is known that worshippers of the god Dagon or Anou used to robe tllemselves in the skins of fish,137 I am unable to adopt this explanation of the Cyprian figures. For, in the first place, Anou's worshippers wore not only the skin, but also the head of a fish, as may be seen from any manual 138 of Eastern antiquities. And, in the second place, there is no very obvious connection between a fish and a lion. Rejecting therefore the theory that the curious coat in which these creatures are dressed was intended for a fish-skin, I would again suggest that we have here worshippers of the lion clad in the skin and called by the name of the animal which they worshipped. FIG. 5. This suggestion will probably be criticized on two heads. It may, on the one hand, be urged that the coat in question does not resemble the shaggy hide of a lion any more than it resembles the scaly skin of a fish. But I maintain that it is quite conceivable for an artificial lion-skin to have been represented in this conventional manner. The first step towards it is seen on a very archaic fragment from Mycenae, now in the British Museum, which 'appears to have been part of a triangular relief filling the space above a doorway.' 19 It shows the head and shoulders of a lion 136 Manuel d'Archdologie Orientale, p. 308.

Upon the hide of the beast are still visible the engraved lines which marked out a quadrifoil pattern, and were doubtless originally filled in with colour. Later art sometimes adorned the lion's skin with similar spots. On a vase by Sosias, for example, it is marked like a panther's hide.140 Another instance of the same process of conventional metabolism is afforded by Athena's aegis, which-though it began as a mere goat-skin-came to be portrayed with fish-scales of silver. So too Plutarch 141 considers the Jewish High Priest a devotee of Dionysus because he was ve/3plCa X p v o" draa o- r o v )v/~evov. There was in fact a decided tendency among the Greeks to embellish the simple garb of skin. And this tendency was strong in Mycenaean times. Two terra-cotta oxen from Ialysus, presented by Prof. Ruskin to the British Museum, are painted with zebra-stripes. The same collection 14 contains early Athenian models of a horse and a dog decorated with parallel bands of colour. Even the human skin, to judge from a fragment of vase-painting found at Tiryns, was not free from a similar tattoo adornment.143 On the other hand it may be objected that what we have here is not a worshipper dressed in a lion's skin but a lion dressed in a lion's skin which is-as Prof. Robertson Smith remarks-much like 'gilding gold.' To this I would answer that the worshippers, as we shall afterwards see, were themselves called 'ozvTer; and that consequently the artist symbolized them as actual lions, while yet-in order to distinguish them from merely natural lions-lie retained their sacrificial garb and ritual act. The first part of this argument may be established by a couple of analogous instances. A Greek stele published by Le Bas 144 has a fine bas- relief of a lion, bearing the legend AEfN FIN inEY . And Pausanias (I. xxiii. 1) narrates that on the Athenian Akropolis was a bronze lioness erected to the memory of a certain woman, Leaina by name. Now if a man called Leon and a woman called Leainca were represented as actual lion and lioness, worshippers called Leontes might very possibly be portrayed in similar fashion. My further contention that the artist added the ceremonial cloaks and vessels in order to differentiate these worshippers from ordinary lions is less easy to prove.

Lenormant and De Witte, Plite des -Monuments, vol. i. p. 226, suggest that the lion on the tomb of the courtesan Lais (Paus. II. ii. 4) was intended to preserve her name (quasi A-s, hfarva). In the legend of St. Marcellus--'A lion having ap- peared to the saint in a vision as killing serpent, this appearance was considered as a presage of good fortune to the enterprise of the Emperor Leo in Africa' (De Gubernatis, op. cit. vol. ii. p. 159).</page><page sequence="26">106 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. pcvov which, according to Joannes Lydus (de mens. iv. 45), was sacrificed to the Cyprian Aphrodite. I take it that the sheep dressed in the sheep-skin was the substitution of a later age for a man called a 'sheep' and dressed in a sheep-skin. Such substitutions for human sacrifice 145 are not unknown on Greek soil. Pausanias (IX. viii. 2) preserves the tradition that 'at Potniae in Boeotia it had formerly been the custom to sacrifice to the goat-smiting Dionysus a child, for whom a goat was afterwards substituted.' 14 And a similar practice seems to underlie the legend of Iphigeneia at Aulis.147 Now if a man called a 'sheep' and dressed in a sheep-skin was thus replaced by an actual sheep in the old sacrificial fleece, the leonine worshippers at their ritual observance may well have been depicted as we see them on Cesnola's bowl. I would also draw attention to the fact that the sheep-cult in question prevailed, according to Lydus, in Cyprus; and it was from Cyprus that Cesnola brought the lion-bowl: so that the comparison here instituted between the two is not without some geographical warrant. FIG. 6. FIG. 7. FIG. 8. FIG. 9. I shall again seek support for my interpretation among the extant examples of the Island gems. The 'E7spep't 'ApXaLoXoyt/Kc for 1889148 published a couple of stones found in the Vapheio tomb near Amyclae. One of these (Fig. 6) is a lenticular agate representing, according to the account of M. Tsountas, 'two lions standing upright on either side of a tree. Each 145 Why a human victim called by the name of the sacred animal should have been sacrificed rather than the sacred animal itself, is not clear. As regards the lion-cult an obvious explanation would be that the lion is an animal not readily to be obtained : but this of course will not apply to the sheep, the goat, or the stag. Prof. A. A. Bevan's suggestion that in the text of Lydus we should read rpo 'oaT0v Acw~iCP OKeLraorprC'voV UVEvOvov (they sacrificed a man clothed in a fleece) leaves this difficulty untouched. And Prof. Robertson Smith's cor- rection ' ra~adr v o L, the participle describing the worshippers,--though it gives good sense and accords with known custom (The Religion of the Semites, p. 450 ff.),--introduces gram- matical difficulties : the singular icAwsl for the plural KAtorsL would be unusual, and the tran- scriber's alteration of E(rcwardEvoL to oceraKaco- /A'vov unexplained if not inexplicable. On the whole I incline to keep the MS. text as sound, and to suppose that the human victim called by the animal name was sacrificed to the animal god in order to cement a supposed relationship between the god and the worshippers. Some- what similar is the sacrifice of the human apos (described on p. 137) to the wolf-god, though in that case there is no question of relationship. 14 The Golden Bough, vol. i. p. 329. 147 See the vase-painting described on p. 135; and The Religion of the Semites, p. 390-' The annual victim at Laodicea ad Mare was a stag, but the story was that in former times a maiden was sacrificed.' 148 PI. 10, Nos. 35-6: Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'Art, vol. vi. p. 843, fig. 426, 16, and p. 847, fig. 431, 6.</page><page sequence="27">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 107 lion holds aloft a ewer (wrp0xov9) with both forepaws, wearing a girdle about his loins and an ornamental hide over his back. The tree is a palm-tree, and seems to grow from a vessel placed on a plinth; the only analogy to it that I know in the circle of Mycenaean remains is the silver cup described in the Mittheil. des Inst. Athen. for 1883, pl. I. These representations must have some mythological meaning. The two lions holding their vessels above a tree may be most plausibly interpreted as 7al(tov 1 T'ev v368cov.' In addition to M. Tsountas' remarks I may point out that the skin coat worn by these figures terminates in a crest between the ears similar to that which we noticed on the asses' fresco at Mycenae and on Lajard's chalcedony (p. 84).149 The second Vapheio gem (Fig. 7) is a glandular sardonyx showing a single lion of like aspect.150 He stands upright bearing a vase in his paws and clad in a coat of shaggy skin. The girdle is here not very clearly dis- tinguished; nor has the engraver marked the two crescent-shaped lines under the jaw, which I take to indicate both in the Mycenae fresco and on the first Vapheio Istone the fact that the head was only a mask; further, the small curly line on the shoulder, noticeable on the last gem,151 is absent in this case. With respect to the watering of a sacred palm-tree, I observe that a gold ring from the same tomb portrays what is apparently an incident from tree-ritual.152 On the left grows a palm-tree from some large vessel. A man wearing nothing but a girdle approaches it in an attitude of adoration. Behind him dances a woman; and lastly, a large shield with the man's raiment (?) occupies the right hand side of the picture. Again, Milchhofer as early as 1883 was able to citel53 a conical steatite from Cyprus, now in the Berlin Museum, which-coming from the same island as Cesnola's lions- reproduces the same design (Fig. 8). For, though Milchhofer in his oXtwr7rla assumed that it depicted the horse, the leonine mane is unmistakable and conclusive. The hide is covered as before with a decorative pattern. It is probable too that the verde antico gem from Salonica,'54 also in the Berlin Museum, represents once more a man dressed in a lion's skin with a dead ox slung across his shoulder (Fig. 9). Different again is the pose of a leonine figure on a carnelian found at Athens, which seems to represent an animal dance (see p. 116). In brief, we have found the lion appearing in the same three postures as the ass: bearing a slaughtered beast; presenting a ewer; and taking part in a mimetic dance. From the foregoing evidence I gather that in the Mycenaean age there still existed an actual lion-cult in which the worshipper, 'aptans 149 A coin of the gens Caecilia, figured in Morell's Thesaurus Num. Tab. iii. 1, shows a lion-headed goddess between whose ears there is a similar excrescence. 15 ' Le lion, sur ces intailles, ressemble souvent au chien ou au renard.' M.

It is at least clear that both water and palm-tree were connected with his cult. To elucidate that connection we must examine the traces of lion-worship which survived the Dorian invasion. (1) In the first place it will be remembered that the lion appears repeatedly as the symbol of Dionysus-a god of vegetation. The seventh Homeric hymn tells the tale of A?eovvo-o pi/polzo who was captured by pirates: 6 0' ~'pa co-L X o v ~yEver' v oOe v '(,--while the vessel was filled with spreading vine-leaves and clambering ivy.

And Horace (Od. ii. 19, 23) adds by way of eulogy:- 'Rhoetum retorsisti leonis Unguibus horibilique mala.' Bentley's objection to the last line misses the point altogether: 'Nihil verba haec vetant, quin verum Leonem intelligas; quales cum Tigridibus et Pardis multos in comitatu habere solitus est Bacchus.' It is true enough that lions regularly take part in Dionysiac processions.'56 But they do so because Dionysus was himself conceived as a lion.157 At Samos there was a temple KEXvro0 A0 aLov- ov.'s Pliny (N.H. viii. 56-58) relates the story of 155 The Louvre, among other Cyprian monu- ments, has the upper portion of a limestone statue, which represented a man standing with his hands raised to his hair: the human head is capped by that of a lion (see Perrot and Chipiez, Phoenicia and its Dependencies, vol. ii. p. 141, fig. 94). It is possible that this unex- plained type refers to the ritual of lion-worship : cp. the description of rvh eovrucd on p. 117ff. 15 E.g. Arch. Zcit. 1864, vol. xxii. P1. CLXXXVI. (2) : Visconti, Mus. Pic-Clem. vol. i. P1. XXXIII. Gerhard, Auserlesene gr. Vasenbilder, vol. i. Pl.

A certain Samian, Elpis by name, encountered a lion on the African coast, and fled for refuge to a tree, calling aloud on Liber Pater. The lion lay at the foot of the tree moaning with pain, till the Samian descended and plucked out from its jaw a bone that was troubling it. 'Qua de causa Libero Patri templum in Samo Elpis sacravit, quod ab eo facto Graeci KrcXJ]Vd70o ALow'ov appellavere.' Aelian, after narrating the legend of Androcles and the lion, alludes to the Samian tale as told by 119 'Erato- sthenes, Euphorion, and others also.' That it is an aetiological myth, pointing to a worship of Dionysus in lion form, can hardly be doubted. The currency of Samos from as early as B.c. 675 bore a lion's scalp as its constant device.'16 Again, the story emphasizes the connection with the tree-god. Fronto161 mentions 'arborem multoruni ramorum, quam ille suum nomen catachannam nominabat': L. Preller explains the word as a corruption of (3Wvipov) KcxqVp or KcaTalcKeXvo. However that may be, the lion as a tree symbol is known from other sources. M. de Longperier 162 published the so-called ' Bouclier d'Annibale,' a large silver disc, the central space of which represents a lion standing in front of a palm-tree. This design was perhaps copied from the reverse of what Mr. Barclay Head calls 'the finest known coin of Carthage.'""3 It is possible, then, that the palm-tree watered by lions on the first Vapheio gem1i may find its nearest analogue among the coast- dwellers of North Africa. (2) In the second place the lion, as the strongest and most terrible of beasts, denoted death and the powers of the underworld.165 This accounts for its occurrence on sepulchral monuments of all sorts. In 1881 Prof. Ramsay discovered near the Phrygian village of Ayazeen a relief of two the statement is made. Roscher, Lex. col. 444 shows that the griffin (= Lion + Eagle) was an Apolline attribute, but not the Lion alone. However, see Head's Hist. num. pp. 130-131, 152, and esp. 236, on coins of Leontini, Syra- cuse, Miletus, and Apollonia. 159 Aelian, i.c. Schneider (ed.

XX VI. 41. 164 Among the Mycenaean intaglios is one which represents two lions standing on either side of a tree ('E9. 'ApX. 1888, P1. 10, No. 16), and another of two lions and three palm-trees (ibid. No. 26) : see further Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'Art, vol. vi. p. 843, fig. 426, 2, 6. On several exx. the lion appears along with a palm-branch, e.g. one drawn by Otto Rossbach in the Arch. Zeit. 1883, P1. XVI. 8. M. Reinach, Esquisses Archdologiques, p. 45, gives an early amulet-mould, now in the Louvre, on which is engraved 'un lion . , . tenant une branche d'arbre entre ses pattes.' And on the triangular sepulchral relief from Mycenae in the Brit. Mus. a bush occupies the corner behind the lion. In all these cases the tree or branch is probably to be explained as a tachygraphic symbol for a landscape background; cp. the collocation of 'lions and palm-trees,' in 1 Kings vii. 36. 165 In districts where the lion was unknown the next formidable animal would be chosen. On a tomb-painting from Orvieto, Hades (Eita) appears in a cap made out of a wolf's (or lion's ?) head: see Roscher, Lex. col. 1805 with figs. on coll. 1807-8.</page><page sequence="30">110 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYOENAEAN AGE. lions rampant guarding the entrance to a grave; and near by the fragment of a second tomb surmounted by a colossal lion's head.166 The resemblance of these figures to the Lion-gate at Mycenae is so striking that a common explanation must be postulated. If the lion symbolizes Chthonian power, it is probable that the relief over the gateway was intended to put the citadel under the protection of the Chthonian deities-a supposition that agrees well with the Mycenaean cult already investigated. In the British Museum there is a collection of archaic sculptures brought by Sir Charles Fellows from Xanthos in Lycia : the best known of these are the slabs that decorated the famous 'Lion Tomb.'167 On the south side was a lion re- cumbent; on the north a lioness playing with her cubs; and in one division of the west side a naked man contending with a lion. Fragments of four other Lycian tombs show portions of lion or lioness.16s Cyprus too has furnished several analogous examples. Pliny (N.H. xxxvii. 66) states that on the tomb of Hermias in that island stood a marble lion having 'inditos oculos ex smaragdis, ita radiantibus etiam in gurgitem, ut territi refugerent thynni'! And modern excavations have brought to light a considerable number of leonine monuments. The Athienu sarcophagus in the New York Museum 169 has a lion couchant at each corner. A limestone lion in the same collection170 formerly stood on a Cyprian grave. The top of a sepulchral stele found by Cesnola shows a pair of recumbent lions back to back.171 The same custom had spread to Etruria at a very early date. In the necropolis at Vulci several stone lions have been found: and Jules Martha 172 states that 'Des lions de pierres sont souvent placds, comme de f6roces sentinelles, a l'ext'rieur des tombeaux 6trusques.' It is perhaps as a death-dealing goddess that Artemis is called a lioness. Homer at least seems to indicate that this is the reason when he makes Hera boast: Dr. Walter Leaf ad loc. observes: 'Death is commonly personified under the form of a lion in Semitic mythology,174 and some traces of this appear even 166 J.H.S. vol. iii. p. 33 ff. with Quarto Plates XVII-XVIII. 167 Scharf's drawing of this is reproduced in the Brit.

For Artemis as a death-goddess see Z 205, 428 &amp;c. She is said to have been worshipped in Ambrakia in the form of a lioness.' Aeschylusl75 mentions her as delighting in 8podoto-a v paXepov X d o vT 7 v: Euripides 176 speaks of her as o'X- a Xealvv lv d aa'Xado-a: and Theocritus177 tells how a devotee of hers- Orjpia 7Teo/e7e-TKce repLo-ra~dv, v 6 ' X J at v a. A tangible commentary on such passages may be found in several archaic representations of the goddess. On a bronze plate discovered at Olympia,178 and on one of. the handles of the Frangois vase,179 the so-called 'Persic' Artemis stands upright holding in either hand a lion. A remarkable series of Artemis terra-cottas has been found at Corfu in an ancient precinct of the goddess: she is represented as attended by various animals, and among them 'le lion a fourni six modeles diff6rents.'180 In the 'ET/ouepi' 'ApXatbooye/tK, 1s for 1893 Dr. Paul Wolters discusses an early Boeotian vase on which Artemis appears with a lion rampant on either side, though she is not actually grasping them. It may however be doubted whether this animal as an attendant of Artemis is not due to her character as 7ru~vVa Oypwov (11. xxi. 470), protectress of wild beasts in general, rather than to any special thought of her death-bringing visitations.182 Less questionable is the lion as servant and symbol of the Chthonian Cybele. The cult of this goddess spread westward from its original home in Phrygia and Crete. The name 'Cybele' is itself a Phrygian word denoting 'caverns';3 s and in a cavern on Mt. Dindymon near Pessinus was her most sacred image-a meteoric mass. 'The tendency of her worship was to dwell on the opposites of birth and death; as is seen in the Phrygian story of s4 Atys,' and the Cretan tales of the birth and death of Zeus. Her connection with the lion was a commonplace in ancient art, and appears in orthodox tradition. Hippomenes and Atalante, who profaned one of her cavern-shrines, were transformed into a lion and lioness :- Luminis exigui fuerat prope templa recessus, Speluncae similis, nativo pumice tectus, Religione sacer prisca,...

In short the lion is a recognized emblem of the Chthonian powers. As such it not only protects tombs and attends the deities of the underworld, but also stands sentinel over the springs and fountains through which subterranean waters are discharged. The Xwpov KcprlooXaa,185 a bronze lion placed above the spring which supplied the Klepsydra at Athens, typifies the performance of this duty. The outlet of a Greek fountain frequently took the form of a X0ovTb6aop~a, and is very commonly repre- sented thus on the vases. It was also the conventional shape for the gargoyles along the top members of temple entablatures. This usage may have originated in more tropical lands. Horapollo states that 'the rising of the Nile is denoted by three large vases; and also by a lion, because it attains its full height when the Sun is in that sign of the Zodiac; for which same cause the spouts of the sacred lavers are made in the form of lions' heads.'1s6 His explanation is, as usual, mere conjecture; but the fact remains that Oriental as well as Hellenic custom associated the lion with water,- probably because springs and fountains have always a Chthonian character, and the lion is the guardian of the Chthonian interests. One other development of this symbol in Greece must be noticed. Herakles, although he appears at times as KopvorloWv the Locust, and i7rol-crvo9 the Slayer of the canker-worm,187 was ordinarily conceived as a hero or even a god 1ss wearing a lion's skin over his head and shoulders.1ls It is noticeable that the nearer we approach to the Mycenaean age the more lion-like does he become. In late art he merely has the skin clasped round him as a cloak or wrapped about his arm; but as we recede into the past, the necessary nature of this cloak becomes evident. Red-figured and black- figured vases show increasing ferocity. On a small Sicilian amphora,190 for instance, of about B.c. 500 he approximates to the leonine aspect. And a specimen of the Island stones, acquired not long since by the British Museum, shows him clad in a complete lion's skin: the head of the beast covers his hair; the forepaws are fastened round his neck; the hind legs 185 Pollux, viii. 112. 186 King, The Gnostics and their Remains, p. 109. 187 Strabo, 613.

Cyprus too has yielded a series of early stone statues of Herakles, ranging from the more refined type of the fragment in the Louvre to the colossus of Amathus, about which 'il y a encore quelque chose de difforme et presque de bostial.' 191 Now it might be argued that, just as Juno Sispita who is depicted on the coins of the gens Thoria wearing a goat's skin and horns over her head was originally no more than a sacred goat, so Herakles who on the coins of the Macedonian monarchs appears with a lion's skin for a head-covering was the outcome of some primitive lion-cult. And if this be so, the connection with the lion as a Chthonian animal is not hard to trace. For Herakles has much to do with waters and the under- world. The Amathusian colossus, his acknowledged prototype, served as the orifice of a fountain.192 The only Heraklean exploits related by Homer are the fight with the sea-daemon and' the descent into Hades to carry off Cerberus.193 These affinities reappear in subsequent tradition. On the one hand, we have Herakles employing the rivers Alpheus and Peneus to cleanse the stables of Augeas; wrestling with the Achelous; capturing the bull that Poseidon had sent out of the sea to Minos; saving Hesione from a sea- monster; slaying the hydra that haunted the swamp near the well of Amymone; and crossing the waves in the golden cup of Helios. Monuments of the best artistic period repeatedly connect him with springs and baths;194 indeed the phrase 'HpdKXeta XovTrp passed into a proverb.195 On the other hand, his underground achievements-the bringing back of Alcestis, and the capture of Cerberus-were not less notorious; he crushed Antaeus whose strength lay in contact with the earth; and his own home with Eurystheus, king of Mycenae and Tiryns, is represented as a large jar sunk in the ground. Lastly, both traits unite in the draining of the Stymphalian marsh, a task most appropriate to one whose relations were at the same time aquatic and chthonic. Here we may pause to apply our results. The lion has come before us as a symbol (1) of vegetation, and (2) of the nether springs. If we glance back at those relics of Mycenaean art which furnished our point of departure, it is evident that they illustrate the second of these two aspects. For almost without exception the leonine figures are represented as bearing vessels of water."9 On one of the Vapheio 191 Perrot and Chipiez, list. de l'Art, vol. iii. p. 570 ; p. 577, Fig. 389; p. 578, Fig. 391. 192 Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'Art, vol. iii. p. 569. 193 For the former as portrayed on early monu- minents, see Roscher, Lex. coll. 2192-3: on the latter, ibid. col. 2205. 194 Roscher, Lex. coll. 2237-8.

And the question arises whether this is an example of 'contaminatio,' or whether there is some essential connection between the vegetative and the chthonian aspects of the symbolism. Personally I incline to the latter opinion. It seems to me a primna facie probability that the animal, which watches over the water gushing from the rock, should also repre- sent the palm-trees and vines springing from the soil. In view of its chthonian character both functions are explicable. There are, moreover, two considerations which tend to substantiate the view. In the first place the leonine Cybele was not only a cave-goddess, but also 'a goddess of vine- growing and agriculture' 197 closely connected with Dionysus.198 And in the second place the same double rapport may be traced in the legends ot Herakles. His connection with waters and the underworld we have already seen. As regards vegetation, Pollux (i. 30-31) has some interesting remarks. ' In Boeotia,' he says, 'they sacrifice piXa to Herakles. I do not mean the poetical word for sheep, but the fruit of the tree. The custom originated as follows. The festival of the god had fallen due, and the time for the sacrifice was at hand-the victim being a ram. Those who were bring- ing it were delayed against their will, because the Asopus had swollen with a sudden flood and could not be crossed. However the children playing round the temple performed the wonted rite. For taking a ripe apple they propped it on four straws by way of legs, adding a couple above for horns. And according to the poets [? Boeotians] they said that they were sacrificing the yXov as a 7rp /aTrov. The story goes that Herakles was pleased with the sacrifice, which is still kept up.' This singular legend, which is given with some variations by Hesychius s.v. MXawvo 'HpaX/KAy and S'uidas s.v. MYjetol 'HpaKcXiy?, certainly points to a connection between Herakles and the apple-tree: with it may be linked that hero's expedition in search of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Nor is it with apples alone that Herakles has to do. Theocritus (ii. 121) calls the white poplar 'HpaccXios ltcpov pvolo, and the Scholiast ad loc. (ed. Diibner, p. 25) gives the reason: ca7-EXwoOv 7ap 6 5HpaKcXy,9 l ?{ ayv 8th "r v Kcp(3epov, 6Tyaey na 'to ~biV &amp; rba 'oij A oo' 'AXcp" O Lzo 08 aOXovvrcs eVT y v/4ao'a EOT 7EOVTO c4 au7tO, 7rcy~ T yT~ e0 C IcXHpaCJX/o.

Again, Pindar (01. iii. 13-34) relates how Herakles was the first to bring the olive-tree from the land of the Hyperboreans and to plant it at Olympia: t8e cat Ketvav XgBva 7rvotati9 0lert v Bopea fvXpoZi.

It is moreover conceivable that Herakles' cl b, the famous P7iraXov, v' ol aliv C~Xdvaave BE~Tpha XClp,199 was originally the symbol of a tqree-god. We know that Hera at Samos was a beam, and Hermes on the Athenian Akropolis a log concealed by myrtle boughs; so that d priori indignity can hardly be urged. And by way of positive evidence the following epigram of Callimachus 200 merits attention: TiLv ~e XCovTrdyyXO(Ve, oavotdve, ,/ryWvov fov OBKe. Ti9; 'ApXFvo,. IHool'; 0 Kpj. Ae'xopat. On this iyyt/vov i;6ov A. Fabri comments-' fagina clava Herculem allo- quitur.' It may be added that on many coins Herakles' club resembles a tree-trunk in size and shape,201 and that a coin of Seige, the obverse of which gives a bearded head of Herakles, has on its reverse a club and a tree planted in a vase.202 FIG. 10. These considerations, though far from amounting to a proof, certainly strengthen the conjecture that the lion as tree-symbol is akin to, if not identical with, the lion as warden of the underworld and its waters. But whatever may be the precise relation between the two aspects of lion-worship, that worship was not yet obsolete in Mycenaean times. In point of savagery it furnishes a parallel to the cult of Artemis Brauronia 199 Theocrit. Id. xiii. 57. 200 Ed. Ernesti, Epigr. xxxvi. 1 See e.g. Morell's Thesaur. Num. ' Gens Caecilia' Tab ii., 'Gens Eppia' i., 'Gens Copo- nia ' i.-iii. 202 Head, Hist.

A slab from the frieze of the Assyrian king Assur-nasir-pal 204 represents two men dressed in the heads and skins of lions apparently engaged in a mimetic dance (Fig. 10): 'one holds a whip in his right hand, and grasps his jaw with the left. The second clasps his hands in front of his breast.' 205 A similar piece of ritual may well have obtained among the inhabitants of Cyprus and the Archipelago. For its existence in Mycenaean times the only direct evidence I can cite is an unpublished seal of which Mr. A. J. Evans kindly sends me an impression (Fig. 11). The stone, an engraved FIG. 11. carnelian, was found at Athens in 1884 and shows two figures much con- torted in order to fill the circular field. The one to the left in the cut has the legs of a man joined to the upper part of a lion by means of a girdle: the other. resembles it, except that the upper part is that of a goat. Now Athenaeus in enumerating sundry kinds of dances observes.: 20 TE 86 pwopfaco-u , Kait ryXai4, Kai X l ()6'o v, aX(i1T(OV E T6KXV(ELSq, Kat XP6 W0roK07r?7, Kac o-Tot)e~a, icat rvpply. His words are cleared up by a passage in Pollux,207 which informs us that 'Morphasmos' meant ' a mimicry of all manner of animals' and adds--6 3 X C o v pXo'-ew~o opflepia eqlo8. ?'Iv &amp;e 'tvia kat AaKRovLKt oPopXr7aa7a s eL/aXEa. dEtXr/vol 3 'lo-av, Kat v7rr' aVTrot' drTVpoLt M 7rTpo/a opxovpevovt. alt r l'v otVLO t' 7 Atovv"ro-,, Kat KapvaTt&amp;Se drr' 'Apr7T6C8t. Thus the context of the passage from Pollux suggests that this dance called 6 Xdwv had some religious (?Dionysiac) significance; and we may provisionally assign it to the lion-cult which we have detected. In favour of a Dionysiac interpretation is a curious vase-painting (Fig. 12) published in 1869 by M. de Longpdrier208 with the following description:- 'Amphore de terre rouge a couverte noire...Homme a tite de lion, avec pieds de lion et queue de cheval.

The third figure to the left is playing a musical instrument of some sort, with streamers attached. 205 In Monuments of Nineveh, I. P1. 82, Layard shows a somewhat similar relief = an armed human figure with the head of a lion; it was 'found lying between the winged bulls forming the entrance to a chamber at Kou- yunjik.' At the same place he discovered two reliefs of colossal men, lion-headed and eagle- footed, armed with dagger and mace: see Nineveh and Babylon, p. 462. 2o1 Athen. 629 F.

No explanation of this strange figure has hitherto been offered; but I think that the elements for explaining it are now to hand. The horse's tail points to the Dionysiac circle: Sileni and Satyrs-even when they have goats' ears and horns-wear equine tails. The lion's mask 20` suggests an animal-disguise; and the crouching posture forcibly recalls the Brauronian bear-dance. Putting these factors together, I see in this vase-painting a representation of a ceremonial dance in honour of the leonine Dionysus- Atsdvvo-or ,ceXyco-in which the celebrant was dressed up to imitate a lion in form and features. There is an interesting passage in Porphyry 210 which mentions a similar practice among the Mithraici:-' The doctrine of Fma. 12. metempsychosis,' he says,' is a tenet of all primitive peoples. And this is apparently the meaning of the Mithraic mysteries. For, hinting at our fellowship with the lower animals, ihey represent us human beings by means of these animals. Thus the mystics who share in the same rites are called by them ' lions,' while the women are known as ' hyaenas s211 and the atten- dants as 'ravens.' The same holds good in the case of their parents, who are spoken of as 'eagles' and 'hawks.' Further, the man who joins in these 209 That the head-covering is a mask is in- dicated by the lines on the cheek: ep. the crescents mentioned on p. 107. I am not sure that M. de Longpirier is right in remarking 'pieds de lion': the feet may be human, though somewhat distorted by the pose of the whole figure. The closest parallel I can cite is a scarab of green jasper from Tharros in Sar- dinia [Brit. Mus. Cat. of Gems, No. 178, P1. C] on which a man with a lion's skin over his head crouches, drawing a sword from its sheath: this can hardly be Herakles, as Herakles on early gems has always a club, or at least a lance. 210 de Abstinentia, iv. ? 16. 211 Acatvas has been plausibly conjectured for VaLvas.</page><page sequence="38">118 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. lion-orgies (Ta' Xeov7TKE) girds on all manner of anircmal forms.211b Pallas in his work on Mithras explains the custom (popularly supposed to allude to the signs of the zodiac) as in reality a reference to the human soul, which they say is enclosed in all manner of bodies. For certain of the Romans also in their own language speak of 'boars,' ' scorpions' (?), 'lizards' (?), and ' black- birds' (?); and have given these names to the attendant deities-to Artemis FIG. 13. the name of She-Wolf; to the Sun that of Lizard or Lion or Snake or Hawk; to Hecate that of Horse, Bull, Lion, or Dog.' There is in the Louvre collection a bronze-plaque (Fig. 13) which-if I am right-aptly illus- 211b Relying on this passage Reinesius emended Apul.

But I suspect that his conjecture Leonticam Ssee Delphin ed. of Apuleius, vol. i. p. 800) is misleading, and that the robe in question, worn by those initiated into the mysteries of Isis, was merely an example of the 'tunicae... varietate liciorum effigiatae in species animal- ium multiformes' affected by the luxurious (see the reff. collected by Erfurdt on Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv. 6, ed. 1808, vol. ii. p. 37), and named after the Elean Zeus (Paus.

It has been described by M. Clermont- Ganneau as 'une representation de l'enfer assyrien.'212 Beneath certain figures emblematic of the stars (?) is a procession of long-robed beings with leonine heads: they lead up to a funeral scene in which two priests of Anou stand on either side of a corpse. Lower still is a monstrous form, grasping two serpents and suckling a pair of diminutive lions : it kneels on the back of a horse in a boat crossing the sea. At the edge of the sea is another monster; and farther off trees and the remains of a banquet. I take it that the whole plaque, surmounted by a lion's head and paws, is of a funerary character. The first row of symbols denotes the heaven, the next two the earth, and the lowest space the underworld. The mourners are arrayed with lions' heads, being in fact the Mithraic XAeov-re who in their ritual thus symbolize the metempsychosis of the departed. It would appear then that the Mycenaean lion-cult involved not only an animal oblation and a 68pooopla or XovTpoopia-in one case for the purpose of watering a sacred palm-but also a mimetic dance. The performants of these several offices were dressed in artificial lion-skins, and probably called by the name of Xe'orVreq. Few features in the symbolism of the Lion are more striking than its resemblance to that of the Ass. By comparing the foregoing statement with the results reached on page 102 we see that the ceremonial obser- vances connected with the latter closely correspond to those connected with the former. And the similarity of ritual is due to similarity of nature. Both animals are sacred to Dionysus: both represent the waters of the underworld. This parallelism is graphically exhibited in a vase-painting from the Vatican collection,213 which portrays men and women symmetrically arranged filling their pitchers from jets of water that are issuing out of two lions' heads and two asses' heads.214 Again, Midas the ass-king is said to have built the first temple at Pessinus to Cybele the lion-goddess. And Cybele employed the humbler beast to bear her image from town to town.215 But if the leonine and asinine functions are thus coincident, we can account for what has been called' the original myth of the ass-lion,' a myth that may 'be traced as far back as the Vedic scriptures.'216 The deity which appeared at one time as an ass, at another as a lion, would readily be conceived as twy-natured.217 Hence by a compendious symbolism, which occurs more than 212.

Benfey in his Einleitung to the Pantchatantra, p. 463, ? 188 collects the authorities for the fable of the Ass in the Lion's skin. The same two animals are associated in other apologues, e.g. the Ass and the Lion hunting together (Phaedr. i. 11; Fab. Aesop. Coll. ed. Halm, No. 259; cp. 260, 323). Oriental sources are quoted by Bochart, Hierozoicon, ed. Rosen- nmiiller, vol. i. p. 180. M. de Longpirier, LEuvres, vol. iii. P1. IX. published a large silver bowl on which the Ass and the Lion are shown together. 217 Caelius Rhodiginus ii. ? 6, says: 'Qui vero inaquosa et arida frequentant, corporibus ares- centibus (cuiusmodi dascahot pernoscuntur qui sunt asininis cruribus) hi se mares plurimum</page><page sequence="40">120 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. once (see p. 138) on the Mycenaean intaglios, the early artist represented the worshippers of this deity as partaking of both natures simultaneously. The ass-figures on the Island gems have apparently the legs of lions. III.-THE CULT OF THE BULL. 'Semibovemque virum semivirumque bovem.' OVID, Ars Am. ii. 24. Another animal, which rivals the lion in the frequency of its appear- ance both on the Island stones and on the metal-work of Mycenae, is the bull. In this case there are of course numerous representations of a purely pastoral character. Many of the gems, for example, show a bull grazing or recumbent in a simple posture which would render any symbolic interpre- tation far-fetched and therefore false. But there are also not a few tokens that the wearers of these gems regarded the bull as an object of religious veneration. It will be convenient to present them in tabular form:- FiG. 15. FIG. 14. FIG. 16. A. The Annali dell'Instituto for 1885 218 published an Island stone, found at Orvieto but apparently of Greek workmanship, which represents (Fig. 14) a couple of bulls in much the same attitude as the lions on Cesnola's Cyprian bowl. They are clad in coats of hide and have girdles about their waists. They stand facing each other, and carry vessels in hands which seem to be human. Between them is a man who grasps one horn of each bull: he wears nothing but a cincture. To right and left of the group are palm-branches. Again, there is in the British Museum 219 a lenticular gem of serpentine or green porphyry, which originally came from Crete. On it (Fig. 15) are the legs of a man combined with the forepart of a goat and the fore- part of a bull. This curious figure, which Tzetzes would term a /ovrpawo- exhibent, interdum quoque leonem ac canem induere videntur.' This may give force to the collocation of Origen contra Celsum (ed.

He wished to represent two men, one with the head and shoulders of a goat, the other with the head and shoulders of a bull.220 But being at a loss to find room for both of them in his limited space, he made the legs of the one serve as the legs of the other also. An exactly similar instance of artistic economy is seen on certain gems cited by Milchhifer,221 and a couple engraved in the 'Eopr/ep', 'ApXaLoXoy7Lc for 1889.Y2 It is notice- able that the British Museum stone shows the same girdle and lappet of skin covering the man's thighs that we have already remarked in the case of the Ass and the Lion. Among some intaglios found at Mycenae in 1888 is one22" which has been described as: T'pav, oi ic1crw r?-o-4a crw ' 70' 3o- c?oc dvop(Artvov, vb Xo7ryv X Eo vr o I, o7rapado-e a'iaypov, oi /t1vov 7 Ke.CaX ,ca't 6 Xat.o'(? advovrat. The illustration here appended (Fig. 16) will suffice to prove that the upper part of this repal is bovine, not leonine; the long curved horns can hardly be mistaken. The author of the foregoing description must have been misled by a few straight cuts of the graving-tool on the neck of the animal, which at first sight suggest a mane. The design seems to represent a human being who wears the rporoP of a bull over the upper half of his body, to which it is fastened by a thick girdle. This personage stoops to raise by means of his mouth and arms the head and neck of a Cretan goat. There is, if we argue from analogy, a likelihood that these three Island stones depict symbolically and actually bull-worshippers in full sacrificial costume. B. Sometimes the human form has only the head of a bull. In the Annali for 1885 "24 Carl Purgold engraves a bull-headed statuette of Mycenaean style: and Cesnola 215 found at Citium a clay idol of the same type. Perrot and Chipiez,22" too, draw a Cyprian sculpture of a man wrapped in a mantle from which protrudes a bovine head; they add-' Une seconde variante du mbme type montre ce mbme personnage portant les deux mains 't son museau; il fait le mouvement de quelqu'un qui se prdpar- erait a enlever une tbte postiche, un masque. Ce geste nous explique peut- etre le vrai caractbre de ces images...11 se pourrait que, dans quelqu'une des f6tes qui se cedlbraient autour des temples, on se ffit affublh de masques d'animaux.' This explanation is, I think, confirmed by a larger statue found at Golgoi,22 which holds in its left hand the head or mask of an ox. C. Thirdly, there are many cases in which only the 8ovKpdvtov is represented. Foremost among these is the magnificent specimen now in 220 Milchhifer, op. cit. p. 78, erroneously takes them for a pair of bulls. 221 Milchh5fer, op. cit. p. 82, Fig. 54a, b, c. 222 P1. 101 Nos. 9 and 10. 223 'EJpepIs 'ApXato'Aoyuoc, 1888, P1. 10, No. 33. 224 Vol. 57, P1.

It was obtained from the largest and richest of the Mycenae shaft-graves, and displays a bull's head of silver (purple patina) with horns of gold; traces of gilding are also to be seen on ears, eyes and muzzle; and upon the forehead between the horns there is a large gold rosette. As to the meaning of this really fine work of art Dr. Schuchhardt writes :228 'On some Egyptian wall-paintings we see among the tribute brought by foreign nations to the Pharaoh the head of an ox,229 and on some other similar paintings we again meet with it, used this time as a weight in a scale.230 However these analogies have as yet afforded no satisfactory explanation of this Mycenaean ox. Perhaps the head was hung up in the grave as a dedicatory offering.' This last view appears to me very probably correct. We know from Theophrastus 231 that to hang up the actual head of the sacrificed ox was a common practice among the Greeks: the man of 'petty ambition' is eager oDvr Oora- ' 7- wpoe'rrl1vtor" traav- TrtKpV r T ElT' o8ov wrpooarra-TaXco-at. But I think we can go a step further. The use of the word 7rpoLETT&amp;rW)8tov , which 232 elsewhere denotes the complete skin of the animal's head worn as a mask or helmet, suggests that the Mycenaean ox-head which is hollow and light may have been a sacrificial mask worn by the buried chieftan during his life-time. At any rate, that it had some such religious import seems clear from the following facts: (i.) Fifty or more ' small heads of oxen, with a double axe between their horns, cut out of gold plate,' 233 were discovered in the same tomb. (ii.) The horns are of gold: for which practice as applied to oxen for sacrifice cp.

The same custom was observed in the case of a goat (Hom. II. xix. 254), and in the case of sheep (Hom. I1. iii. 273). It will also be remembered that there are representations of both the ass and the lion in which the forelock is distinctly emphasized.234 The device of a bull's head with a rosette or ornamental pattern on the forehead is known also as the shape of a Mycenaean vase from Carpathos drawn by Mr. Murray.235 Max Muller 236 cites a similar example of the potter's art. In the Jahrbuch des k. d. Arch. Inst. for 1892237 is a woodcut of a Mycenaean cup from Egypt, adorned with bulls' heads-rosettes being inserted between the horns. The tradition lingered on into much later times. In the Terra-cotta Room at the British Museum is a lamp in the form of a bull's head with a palmetto ornament between the horns and a rosette on the forehead. Conze in an exhaustive essay on Griechische Kohlenbecken 238 depicts several examples of this design serving as mere ornamentation on the handles of Greek amphorae,-a usage perhaps to be connected with the ox-heads that decorate the handles of Cesnola's bowl. Without the rosette the t3ovKcpdvtov is a still more frequent motif in Aegean art. The 'ET pepil 'ApXatoXooytLic for 1888 239 published a vessel from Mycenae, the rim of which is embellished with a whole series of them. They appear on several samples of Island stones in the British Museum;240 also on certain steatite and haematite cylinders from Cyprus.241 In metal work too they furnish a frequent pattern; sometimes forming the whole design-as on a Rhodian trinket discovered by Messrs. Salzmann and Biliotti; sometimes being mere stop-gaps-as on a gold plate figured by Dr. Schuchhardt.242 Nor must we omit the important gold ring from Mycenae on which are 243 'three unmistakable heads of oxen, with long curved horns.' To recapitulate: the extant remains of Achaean art comprise, in the first place, one Island stone portraying skin-clad bulls engaged in a ceremonial presentation of oenochoes, another showing a man disguised by the head and shoulders of a bull, and yet another representing a similar personage raising a slain animal from the ground; secondly, several terracottas and stone statuettes depicting bull-headed humanity; thirdly, numerous instances of the bull's head used alone, either with or without a rosette between the 234 See pages 81, 84, 101n. 121, 106.

It remains to elucidate the nature of the cult or cults to which these diverse relics bear witness. Now it will be observed that one of our three Island stones came from Crete, the home of the Minotaur. According to consistent tradition this monster was the offspring of Pasiphae and the bull that Poseidon sent out of the sea in answer to Minos' prayer. The antiquity of the whole myth is beyond question: it is-says Miss Harrison244-' undoubtedly the oldest that is connected with Theseus'; in fact, the only one of his series which occurs on black-figured vases. And the said vases, despite Milchh6fer's desperate attempt to claim the Minotaur as 245 'ein pfer'dek6pfiger Damon,' represent him as clad from head to foot in a bull's skin with an undeniable bull's head and tail.246 In later art too he repeatedly appears as a man with a bovine head.247 To trace his pedigree further back may prove instructive. Minos, Pasiphae's husband, was the grandson of that Minos who judged in the nether world; and he in turn was the child of Zeus by Europa. It was to the same island of Crete and under the same disguise of a sea-faring bull that Zeus carried off Europa.248 The story went that he wedded her near a spring under the Gortynian plane-tree, which in token of the event is ever-green. And the beautiful series of Cretan coins, which represent Europa sitting amid the branches, shows that the sacred tree is an integral part of the legend. Receding yet further, we learn that Europa was daughter of Agenor, king of the Phoenicians; and that Agenor was the offspring of Poseidon by Libya. Poseidon-it is well known-had strong affinity with the bull, which in Homer appears as the victim especially devoted to his honour. That he sent a bull out of the sea to Minos, we have already observed. On another occasion he dispatched a similar emissary to slay Hippolytus. Indeed he is himself described by Hesiod as -ra peo' 'Evvooalyatov, 04b 0'77,8v 1 Kffl7 Vl EXEL pve-ai -e wro6Xa.-[Scut. 104.] Tzetzes ad loc. comments": AJ 'roi Ovo'ias rai'pwv E7 d'treXkeL, 7r Iloo'et?&amp;LJVt Tavpetol KtX7)Or BoooreK6--an obvious assumption of effect for cause.

Among other subjects is a man wearing what seems to be a bull's mask, and armed with shield and sword; the figure is in- scribed CENTAVRVS, which M. Miintz in the Rev. Arch, for 1876, P1. XXIV. p. 407 holds to be a mistake for MINOTAVRVS. In either case it is a new type, to which perhaps Miss Harrison's words are applicable : 'It seems possible that the form of the Minotaur may have been suggested by the necessities of a mimetic dance, the part of the Minotaur being taken by a man with a bull-head mask.'-Myth. and Mon. p. cxxvii. 248 To the received authorities must be added the recently discovered metope from Selinus: the Academy for April 16, 1892, p. 381.</page><page sequence="45">ANIMIAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 125 of an Egyptian, Epaphos by name. And once more we are met by the same symbolism; for Herodotus 249 identifies Epaphos with the bull Apis. Lastly, Epaphos is the son of Zeus, whom we have seeni already under the disguise of the sea-bull, by lo, who through fear of Hera 250 was said to have been changed into a cow. For the sake of clearness I append the stemma in full, marking in Clarendon type those persons who were partially or entirely bovine: lo = Zeus changed into a cow on account of Hera's jealousy Epaphos Poseidon = Libya Lysianassa Thebe STelephae Telephassa = Agenor Belos= Anchinoo Enualios Tyro king of Egypt Argiope I I I / 1 Zeus = Europa Kadmos Phoinix Kilix Aegyptus Danaus Minos Rhadamanthus, Acacus I or Sarpedon king of Crete and Dodona Lukastos Minos = Pasiphae = The bull of Poseidon concealed in Daedalus' cow Androgeos, The Minotaur slain by the bull of Poseidon, which Heraklcs brought from Crete to Marathon. The prominent figure throughout this whole legend is the sea-bull of Poseidon, which weds the daughter of Epaphos, seduces Pasiphae, and slays Androgeos. Why' the Greek god of everything liquid '--as Seyffert 251 well terms him-should have been represented by a bull, is not altogether clear. 24, Herodot. ii. 153 ; iii. 27, 28. 250 It was Hera who also struck with frenzy the three daughters of the Argive king Proetus, so that imagining themselves to be heifers-- 'implerunt falsis mugitibus agros.' These le- gends throw light on the traditional epithet 8owrLs. I may add the conjecture that Argos of the hundred eyes was a leopard. The pea- cock was fabled to have derived its tail from him (e.g. Mosch. ii. 58): but that he is not to be identified with that bird is clear from the legends of his prowess; he did to death 'a fierce bull which ravaged Arcadia, a satyr who robbed and violated persons, the serpent Echidna, . . . and the murderers of Apis' (Smith, Dict. Biog. and llyth. vol. i. p. 282 b.). In Baumeister's Denkmilcer, vol. i. p. 753, we have him portrayed wearing a leopard's skin, the spots of which are continued as eyes over the nude parts of his body; and Roscher, Lex. col. 274, gives a vase-painting in which he wears an animal's hide over his shoulders. 2"1 Class.

According to Strabo's conjecture, the symbolism was meant to recall either- 'The bellowing voice of boiling seas '-or-' The wave-worn horns of the echoing bank': Strab.

Others have detected allusions still more recondite, *e.g.:- Smith, Diet. Myth. vol. iii. p. 984 s. v. 'Taurocephalus': 'to indicate their fertilizing effect upon countries.' But, rationalism apart, it will not be denied that the connection between water and the bull was intimate. Oceanus is by Euripides (Orestes, 1378) called ravpo6cpavo9. And river-gods were commonly conceived as tauriform: M. de Longpirier, whose knowledge of ancient vase-paintings was extensive and reliable, has left252 an elaborate list of the extant types; arranged in order of theriomorphism they are these- i. A bull. ii. An androcephalous bull. River-god = iii. A taurocephalous man. iv. A horned man with fish's body and tail. v. A youth with horned head. To the examples of the earliest types cited by the French savant should be added an 'androtauric' vase from Kameiros, now in the British Museum.253 It represents the head of the local river-god; the horns are green (i.e. discoloured blue ?), and a blackish face peers out from the 7rpoTroP of a bull. An aryballos 254 of the same provenance in the form of a bull's head also deserves mention. Admitting then that to the Hellenic mind there was some primitive connection between water and the bull, the question arises whether that connection can furnish an adequate account of the intaglios above described. To deal first with the Orvieto gem. Its main design is flanked by two palm-branches-the conventional abbreviation for a landscape background 255 2,2 (Euvres, ed.

A, a bull standing by a full-grown palm with a large shield between his legs. In fact, the bull and the palm-tree formed a fixed 'schema' in Mycenaean days. As with so many of the gem engravings, this device reappears among the coin-types of the fifth century B.c.-e.g. a didrachm of Mytilene (Coins of the Ancients, P1. XI. No. 28) has two calves' heads face to face with a tree between them. Also a Nolan amphora in the Brit. Mus. (Lenormant and De Witte, El. Cer. ii.

The nearest analogue to this strange composi- tion will, I think, be found in contemporaneous pictures of the ravpocaOd#cca, a very ancient custom which is delineated on the following remains of' Mycenaean manufacture:- (1) A fragmentary fresco found at Tiryns. This ' chef-d'oeuvre of the wall-paintings,' as Dr. Schuchhardt 257 calls it, depicts a man in the scantiest garb, who with his right hand clutches the horn of a rushing bull; whether the artist intended to portray the man as actually on the animal's back, or only on the far side of it,258 is uncertain. (2) Two gold cups from the Vapheio tomb near Amyclae show scenes of bull-hunting and bull-taming, in which men take part who are 'naked except for a thick projecting girdle, from which hangs a little apron both before and behind.' 259 These cups obviously illustrate the same pursuit as that evidenced by the Tirynthian painting.260 (3) A green jasper 261 found at Mycenae in 1892 exhibits a man wearing a girdle only who has grasped by the horn and twisted backwards and down- wards the head of a powerful-looking bull. (4) A lenticular haematite in the British Museum, published by Mr. A. S. Murray in the Revue Archdologique for 1878,262 shows a nude man in a much distorted position holding the horns of a bull. (5) A similar haematite, also in the British Museum, published by Mr. Murray in the Jahrbzuch des k. d. Airch. Inst. for 1890,263 represents a long- horned bull mastered by a couple of unclad men, who have seized it by the horns. One of the two, placed above the bull's back, closely resembles the so-called 'acrobat' of the stucco from Tiryns. (6) On a gem of somewhat later workmanship, previously drawn by Dr. Heydemann in the same Journal,264 a nude man in an almost horizontal position grasps with his right hand the horn of a bull: the field is occupied by a tree-branch, again a symbol of open-air scenery.

A bull, charging at full speed, has just tossed a man who falls through the air face uppermost. His head-dress is of a decidedly unconventional sort, being to all appearance made of lattice-work 266 and ornamented with a pair of curved appendages that may be meant for imitations of the horns of a bull. But in view of the extremely decorative style of the design, it is difficult to pronounce upon details with any certainty. (8) Finally, on part of a small round pyxis, discovered at Mycenae,267 a a man with the same girdle and apron is seemingly tossed by the horns of a bull. In the absence of any contrary indication, this fragment may be classed with the preceding designs. All the above representations have with great probability been referred to the ravpoKaO~cca, a ceremony possibly alluded to by Homer, Ii. xx. 403-5: ipvyev (09 OTCe Traipo9 rqpvryev XK6/lcevo 'EXxco;vaov acIqb, 'pvalcra KopWv EXKVc r"268 yavvrat 8 re roic dvoaXOvw. and certainly described by several authors of a much later date. Pliny, for instance, (N. H. viii. 182) says:- 'Thessalorum gentis inventum est, equo iuxta quadrupedante, cornu intorta cervice tauros necare; primus id spectaculum dedit Romae Caesar dictator.' and Vaillant remarked that his words explain the 'taurus ferociens' that appears on some of Caesar's denarii.269 Again, Suetonius (v. Cland. c. 21) relates that Claudius Caesar renewed the experiment :- 'praeterea Thessalos equites, qui feros tauros per spatia Circi agunt insiliuntque defessos et ad terramin cornibus detrahunt.'

These coins 274 in some respects approach more nearly to the primitive custom than the spectacular displays of Rome: for, whereas in the latter the huntsmen rode on horseback and were presumably clad, the coins of Thessaly 'show an unclad combatant tackling the bull on foot.' Extant inscriptions prove the existence of the rite at Aphrodisias (Boeckh, C. I. G. vol. ii. p. 1109, No. 2759b), Smyrna (ib. p. 740, No. 3212), Ancyra (vol. iii. p. 88, No. 4039, line 46), and Sinope (ib. p. 119, No. 4157). On the whole, we have adequate evidence for the assertion that (a) up to and even during the Christian era this practice of ravpoicKaOdta obtained among the Thessalians; and that (,8) it can be traced back into the earliest period of Aegean history, when-to judge from the provenance of our data -it prevailed over a much wider area. But how does this bear on the bull as emblem of the water-god ? By way of answer I may quote Mr. Head's Historia Numorum, p. 246: 'Poseidon,' he writes, 'was very generally revered in Thessaly as the creator of the national soil, as well as of the celebrated Thessalian horses which gra~zed in the rich alluvial plains...As Poseidon Taipeoo (Preller, Gr. Myth. i. 446) games were held in his honour, in which the youth of Thessaly exhibited their skill in seizing wild bulls by the horns...These peculiarly national religious festivals were called Trapeta (Preller, i.c. note 1) and ravpoKaOa`fta, and their prevalence throughout the land is amply proved by the coins, on which we see a Thessalian youth pulling down a raging bull, while on the reverse is usually the ]horse of Poseidon.' The 'ravpoKa? fr*ta, then, constituted a religious or semi-religious rite, which took place in honour of Poseidon Taureos. If, bearing this in mind, we return to a consideration of our Orvieto gem, its meaning is no longer enigmatic. The two bovine figures dressed in bulls' hides and carrying oenochoes in human hands are representatives of the bull-god Poseidon. That they could be portrayed with the legs of bulls, implies that they were themselves called Trapot:275 and most fortunately Athenaeus (425 C) has preserved a record of the fact- 272 Head, Hist. Nnum. p. 254, Fig. 175. 7a Head, Hist. Nunzm. p. 250. 274 The coins of Catana (figured in the Jahr- buch des kc. d. Arch. Inst. for 1889, p. 119), which show 'a man-headed bull with a figure surprisingly like the acrobat of Tiryns on its back' (Schuchhardt, op. cit. p. 120), have been otherwise explained by Miss E. Sellers, who points out that the river-god is a mere badge, not an integral part of the design. 75 If Mt. Taurus on the coins of Tauromeniumn is regularly denoted by a bull ; and if even the Roman gens Thoria could adopt the same 'type parlant'; surely these human 'raipoL, of whom Athenaeus speaks, might well be depicted as actual oxen, while at the same time their ritual garb was retained to distinguish them from ordinary cattle. I conceive that, so far as artistic representation is concerned, they furnish an exact parallel to the leonine V8poopdpot on the Cyprian bowl. Those who performed the Aov- TrdIc were called AoEVres and portrayed as lions: those who danced the apic'rEa were known as 6pKICoL and dedicated statuettes of bears: those H.S.-VOL. XIV.

Similarly on the Orvieto gem, the athlete grasping by the horn each representative of the divine Travpov probably denotes an actual custom. Is it rash to conjecture that both here, and wherever the TavpolcaO~lrta are found, we have a primitive religious rite intended to symbolize, if not to secure, man's mastery over the waters of Poseidon ? With regard to the second gem, the serpentine from Crete, I should not hesitate to refer it to the same cult, were it not for the presence of the goat- garb in addition to that of the bull. The two animals would hardly have been combined on a single stone, if the respective rituals which they imply had been wholly independent. And, since Poseidon Taureos was never, so far as we know, represented by a goat, we are driven to seek some explana- tion of the bull that will account for the simultaneous appearance of the goat. Now the genealogy given above associated the former animal in Crete not only with Poseidon but also with Zeus-Zeus Kretagenes as the coins call him.276 It was the bull-Zeus who wedded Io, begat Epaphos, and carried off Europa. And we observed that this last occurrence was intimately connected with the sacred plane-tree at Gortys, which in memory of the event was ever-green. Whether this connection between the Cretan bull and vegeta- tion is accidental or essential cannot be decided off-hand. It is known that Demeter among the Boeotians was worshipped as Tauropolos.277 It has been proved, too, by Mr. Frazer that Dionysus was often conceived as a bull,"2 and that his bull-form is 'an expression of his proper character as a deity of vegetation.' 279 But Demeter and Dionysus are not the Cretan Zeus, and parity of reasoning is apt to deceive. There was, however, an interesting ceremony yearly performed on the Athenian Akropolis under the name of Bouphonia or Diipolia, which may serve to establish our connection. The custom, we are told, was introduced who took part in the 'ratpera (= -ravpoica06acia, Hesych. s.v. Ta'pa) were named -ravpoi and represented as we see.

From this we may perhaps infer that the practice thus instituted was originally a Cretan one. Moreover, the name Diipolia suggests that the ox represented Zeus; and Zeus as a god of vegetation; for the details of the ritual indicate that the ox which tasted the barley-cakes was in all probability' viewed as the corn- deity taking possession of his own.' 280 If this be so, we have on the one hand the legend of the Gortynian plane and on the other the ritual of the Diipolia as evidence that the Cretan bull-Zeus symbolized vegetation. The evidence, though by no means conclusive, may be provisionally accepted for what it is worth.281 We next note the fact that the goat as well as the bull was a recog- nized emblem of Zeus Kretagenes.28" According to Hesiod, Theog. 484, the infant Zeus was hidden Airyai' v o"pet, and tradition told how he had been nourished by the divine goat Amaltheia:- 'Huic fuit haedorum mater formosa duorum, Inter Dictaeos conspicienda greges, Cornibus aeriis atque in sua terga recurvis; Ubere, quod nutrix posset habere Iovis.'

In memory of this tutelage the moneys of several Cretan towns regularly employed the forepart of a goat as their device.2"3 Thirdly, it is just possible that the notched shield284 between the legs of the goat-man indicates an orgiastic dance in armour, such as was said to have been performed by the Curetes to drown the cries of the infant Zeus. Putting these stray hints together, I infer as probable, though far from certain, that the second gem represents a mimetic dance by two worshippers of Zeus Kretagenes, one clad in a bull's skin, the other in a goat's skin.285 That such religious mummeries were actually in vogue among the Cretans is proved by a marble slab to be noticed later on. Whether the third gem, the rC'pa9 from Mycenae, illustrates the cult of Poseidon Taureos, or that of Zeus Kretagenes, or again some further 280 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 40. s81 Coins of Rhosus, on the gulf of Issus, show a deity 'standing on base placed between two bulls: his head is horned and he holds a fulmen and an ear of corn,' Head, Hist.

Num. p. 382. 283 See for exx. the 'E P-qepIs 'ApXatoAo-yuKi, 1889, P1. 12, Nos. 10 and 11: P1. 13, Nos. 6 and 7, 10 and 11. 284 This is sometimes described as 'an open oyster' ! But the occurrence of a similar shield on the bull-gem from Ialysus (p. 126, n. 255), and a haematite in the Brit. Mus. (Cat. No. 74 'two drilled holes united by a groove . . . and lines of uncertain meaning'), which shows a soldier driving off a pair of oxen, makes it certain that a shield is intended. See Mr. A. J. Evans in the last number of this Journal, p. 215, n. 43a. 285 It is also conceivable that the 'schema' of this gem is intended to portray one man with an alternative disguise. In that case it would be a variation of the compendious type ex- hibited by the lion-legged asses. K2</page><page sequence="52">132 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. form of bull-worship, we are not in a position to decide. Nor can we determine the precise significance of the bull-headed statuettes and masks which we have catalogued. But that in Mycenaean times bull-worship was still active, and active in more forms than one, has-I think-been adequately proved. Before leaving the subject, there is one side-issue which merits atten- tion. We have seen reason to suppose that Herakles was the humanized product of a lion-cult, and that Hera in theriomorphic guise was a sacred cow. Between these two deities tradition recognized a constant antagonism. Herakles appears in Greek literature as 8ovOolv(rn, 8ovdryos', 8ov6yqyr , ravpodovoo ; and poc7r^v 7rd-v'a "Hp q was said to have been 'his foe through life.'286 It is not improbable that this traditional hostility is but the mythopoeic version of the enmity which naturally subsists between the two animals,-an enmity illustrated by that most common of all scenes in Mycenaean art, the lion attacking the bull. In favour of this are several ancient Etruscan monuments representing the Italian Hercules and Juno engaged in combat with club and sword :287 both are clad in the hides of animals-Hercules wearing the lion's skin, Juno the pelt of her Lanuvian goat.288 The same conception may also have regulated certain points in the Mithraic ceremonial. That the lion here played an important part, we have already learnt. Scarcely less important was the bull, which seems to have symbolized life. The Taurobolia28s or 'Baptism of Blood' became in later days a very wide-spread custom, extending even to Eleusis. According to M. Lajard,290 the mystics had to pass through some twelve degrees before attaining final fruition. Of these the first three were known as the Terrestrial Degrees and entitled (1) The Soldier, (2) The Lion, (3) The Bull. It is not impossible that this succession was due to the Mycenaean type of Lion at war with Bull. That the process was not the reverse, and that Mycenaean worship owed nothing to Mithras, is certain. As Mr. King remarked :2 'the complicated system of the Mithraici was evidently the creation of much later times, and of a religion vainly struggling for life.' 2s6 Dr. Fennell in the Encycl.

XhapoL &amp;h 'ro7^r' 'rye7vovro. ARISTOPH. Nub 354. T'here is in the British Museum 292 a certain lenticular haematite, which bears a device described by Mr. A. H. Smith as a 'monster, with head and foreparts of stag, and with human legs, brought over its back so as to fill field.' This 'monster' offers, it will be seen, a close analogy to some FIG. 17. of the Island gems which we have already considered, and-if I am not mistaken-represents a human being wearing over his head and shoulders the foreparts of a stag. The girdle and the lappet of hide falling over the thighs tend to confirm this interpretation. The design is as usual carefully arranged so as to occupy the entire space; and there are two objects in the field which, though unnoticed in the official catalogue, may possibly bear on our subject. The object lying below the body of the stag is explained by the glandular haematite mentioned on page 131, note 284; in both cases the ' lines of uncertain meaning in the field ' denote a spear-head, and here perhaps betoken the sacrificial character of the animal-man. There is also a straight cut resembling a tree-branch behind the human legs; but it is unfortunately arrested by a flaw in the stone. This is, so far as I am aware, the only representation of a stag in Mycenaean art which can claim a distinctly religious signification.293 But its claim is strong enough to justify us in reviewing such traces of stag-worship as may have survived into later times, in the hope of obtaining a clue to the meaning of our gem. 292 Cat. of Gems, No. 70. 293 It is possible that some religious use was made of the stag-vessel, cast in an alloy of lead and silver, which was found in the largest shaft-grave at Mycenae (Schuchhardt, op. cit. p. 246). Du Cange mentions that it was customary among the early Christians to have cervi argentei placed by the baptismal font (Gloss. vol. ii. p. 296 b). The British Museum (Vase-room I. case 37) possesses an aryballos from Nola or Vulci moulded in the form of a stag's head.</page><page sequence="54">134 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. (1) Evidence with regard to the stag-cult of the Greeks294 is mainly associated with the name of Artemis 'EXac/a or 'EXaoltaia. Pausanias (VIII. xxxvii. 2) informs us that at Lykosoura this goddess was apreXopIer 8eppa dXdkov: and in another passage (VII. xviii. 7) gives the following description of the Laphria-a yearly festival, which the men of Patrai celebrated in her honour. 'They set up logs of wood, still green and some sixteen cubits long, in a ring round the altar; inside upon the altar itself are laid the driest billets. Moreover, for the day of the festival they make smooth an ascent to the altar, covering the steps up to it with earth. The first ceremony is a splendid procession in honour of Artemis; behind it rides the sacred maiden (,q ilepwpIU~ 7rapOvol) on a car drawn by a yoke of stags. From that moment till the day following the city and the citizens are busied with the sacrifices. They cast alive on to the altar edible birds and victims of all sorts, wild boars too and stags and gazelles; others add whelps of lions and bears, and others again full-grown wild beasts: they also place on the altar the fruit of tame trees. After this they kindle the wood. Hereupon I saw a bear and some other animal thrown to one side of the altar, partly by the first rush of the flames, partly by their own struggles to escape: they were, however, restored to the pyre once more by those who had originally cast them on. And the story goes that no man is injured by the beasts.' In this custom 71 [eCpoI~ivor wrapOdvov drawn by stags is an obvious incarnation of Elaphia herself; indeed, throughout the festival Artemis appears in Homeric guise as reprorwoJvy ICarpoot Ica U ciely EXL oto9T4 . Odyss. vi. 104. Legendary tradition illustrates the same affinity. Actaeon, who surprised Artemis while bathing, was changed into a stag and so devoured by his own hounds. On a metope from Selinus this transformation is skil- fully suggested by the head and hide of a stag, which Actaeon wears over his shoulders.295 In later bas-reliefs 296 and paintings 297 the antlers are already sprouting from his forehead. There is also the myth that Agamemnon once killed a stag in the grove of Artemis, in consequence of which crime the Greeks were detained at Aulis by contrary winds; the seer Calchas demanded the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, but the goddess at the critical moment substituted a stag for the maiden, whom she transported to the Tauric Chersonese as her future priestess. Again, it was Artemis who met 294 For Semitic custom see The Religion of the Semites, pp. 390, 447-' In certain rituals we find the stag or gazelle as an exceptional sacrifice. The most notable case is the annual stag-sacrifice at Laodicaea on the Phoenician coast, which was regarded as a substitute for a more ancient sacrifice of a maiden, and was offered to a goddess whom Porphyry calls Athena (de Abst. ii, 56), wvhile Pausanias (III. xvi. 8) identifies her with the Brauronian Artemis, and supposes that the cult was intro- duced by Seleucus.' 2.

But the Vatican scholiast ad loc. remarks: 'Taygete, daughter of Atlas and Pleione, was herself turned into a stag by Artemis in order to escape the importunities of Zeus.' Finally, Euripides (Helen. 381 ff.) tells a similar tale about Cos, the daughter of King Merops:-- ai' TE 7OT "ApTrepLv eieXopevo-aTO, XPvooKcpar' Xabov, MMipo7roc TtLrav1a icovpav, KaXXoo"vav e"vKeZev. The testimony of legend is supported by that of language. A constant epithet of Artemis is dXaf7Pd3Xo1 or E'kaoXa~oKvov. Now Mr. Frazer observes 'that wherever a god is described as the eater of a particular animal, the animal in question was originally nothing but the god himself,' and that 'divine titles derived from killing animals are probably to be similarly explained.'299 It may thlerefore be surmised that Artemis herself was sometimes conceived as a stag, her ministrants being credited with the same shape. To celebrate stag-rites the Phocians held their festival of the 'EXarlPda,300 about which Plutarch 301 says that 'the greatest of all their festivals is the Elaphebolia which they still keep in honour of Artemis at Hyampolis.' At this festival flat-cakes were offered, made of dough, sesame, and honey, and moulded into the shape of stags.302 At Athens too in the month Elaphebolion (leer were sacrificed to Artemis in her character of Elaphebolos.ao3 As regards the traces which this stag-cult has left on Greek art, the representation that most nearly resembles our Island stone is a vase- painting drawn in Gerhard's Griechischc Vasenbilder (vol. i. P1. 89). It shows one side of a red-figured crater. In the centre stands a draped female figure bearing a wreath in her left hand and a sprig in her right, which she raises in a supplicating manner toward a youth who advances from the left. Her face is concealed beneath a curious mask shaped like a stag's head with long branching antlers; the neck is covered with spots (or air-holes ?). The young man on the left holds a sharp sickle or sacrificial knife in one 298 Apollodorus too (II. v. 3) remarks: 7iv 8c StXAapos iv Olvdn, XpVo'Kepws, 'AprimIos Iepd.

Beyond this group upon a square base stands a second female figure, winged and with averted looks, bearing a wreath and a ribband in her hands. The field is occupied by a fillet. This vase-painting Milchh6fer interprets as 'the (equine) Gorgon holding flowers before Perseus, who bears a harp6.' Enthusiasm for the horse is not to be disconcerted by a pair of long antlers ! I would suggest that it depicts the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, who either wears the stag's mask of the Artemis cult, or is already being metamorphosed by the goddess into a stag. The youth on the left will then be one of the gXKpLTOL veaviaL (Eur. Hec. 525) employed on such occasions,304 and the winged Nike with sorrowful eyes will hint at the victory dearly purchased by a sacrifice like this. In any case I conceive that we have here a clear reminiscence of the stag-cult in post-Homeric times. On the frieze from the temple of Apollo at Phigaleia we find Artemis driving a chariot drawn by a couple of stags..05 In later art, for example in the famous 'Diana of Versailles,' she is not unfrequently accompanied by a stag. Several types are known from a numerous collection of terra-cottas discovered in one of her precincts, and published by M. Henri Lechat.o?6 A bronze medallion of Antoninus Pius, figured by Roscher,307 represents her holding a stag by the horn; and on two coins, drawn by Spanhem,308 she rides the same animal and is borne by a team of them, Jopcvny tePtdcoov ?ery-pdvT 'p (Nonn. Dion. 48, 450). Again, on the Hermannstadt statue of Hecate the stag appears as a sacrificial victim. (2) Nor is it only Artemis who is associated with the stag.

(3) Lastly, it will be remembered that on Mount Lukaios in Arcadia there was an Abaton-or o-5Kwoa as Euripides (El. 1274) terms it-into which no man was allowed to enter, on pain of death within a twelvemonth.y4 This stringent rule seems to have undergone some modification; for Plutarch315 states that voluntary transgressors were stoned by the Arcadians, but that those who erred unwittingly were sent to Eleutherae. Local report affirmed that all who trod this sacred ground, whether men or beasts, lost their shadows:316 and Plutarch adds that any man who entered the grove was called an 6X a 0o v. Qu.

The explanation of these singular superstitions seems to be that the precinct was once the sacred haunt of a wolf-god. All rash intruders would be regarded as the natural prey of this fierce deity, and slain as offerings to him under the name of 'stags.' They were said to lose their shadows (i.e. souls) and die the death. It is known at least that human victims were until a comparatively late date sacrificed at the altar of Zeus Lukaios. Lobeck (Aglaophamus ii. 895, note n.) has somewhat misrepresented the facts, though his interpretation is correct: he states- 'adytum ingressos, nisi aufugissent, immolatos, fugitivos dXd ovq appellatos esse, quod deus loci inquilinus eos ceu cervum lupus insectari fingeretur.' He was, I suppose, attracted by Festus' remark that runaway slaves were known as 'cervi,' and perhaps also by the proverbial phrase 'EXd~eto9 ,avp applied to cowards.317 Which of the three cults thus reviewed is illustrated by our Mycenaean gem ? Probably not the Dionysiac rite: because its initiates wore fawn- skins, and the intaglio shows a full-grown stag. In favour of Artemis is the vase-painting which represents Iphigeneia with a somewhat similar stag's head and horns. But the balance of probability inclines, I think, towards the ritual on Mount Lukaios. For, on the one hand, we know that the devotees of the deity there worshipped were called 'Xawot; and, on the other hand, the animal-cults already examined lead us to suppose that a man wearing the wrpo-ropu of a stag, as we see him here, is likely to bear 314 Paus.

Again, the spear-head-which on the Island stones is often a conventional symbol for death--may refer to the local practice of human sacrifice; and the tree-branch conceivably indicates the hallowed grove. But if it is impossible to determine with confidence, the precise rapport of the gem in question, it will hardly be denied that it represents a stag-worshipper of some sort dressed in his ceremonial attire. V.-THE CULT OF THE HORSE. J17rwrojtoopqo b v 860 ToV TtVE E 6 , 7VtOXKCov SE e6o9 fpi TQov. PLATO, Phaedrus, 253 D. We come now to the horse, the main topic of Milchhifer's chapter on 'Inselsteine.' Of the seven gems which lie quotes as illustrative of this animal I am unable to detect it upon more than two. The first (Fig. 18) is a Fic. 18. Fie. 19. lenticular rock-crystal found at Phigaleia and now preserved in the Berlin collection.31s Two upright figures with human arms face one another, dressed apparently in the skins and heads of horses. They wear the girdle with which we are already familiar, but seem oddly enough to have the legs of birds. Between them stands a nude man holding the lower jaw of each horse-head. The second (Fig. 19) is a lenticular pebble of verde antico from Crete, also in the Berlin Museum.319 It agrees in several remarkable features with the former gem. An upright figure clothed in a horse's mask and skin -the latter being prolonged into a crest between the ears-wears the same girdle round the waist, and (an important point of resemblance) stands on the same bird-legs. On its right shoulder it bears a slaughtered stag; and the field is occupied by two stars and a tree-branch. The pose of the whole figure recalls both the Salonica gem (p. 106) =a lion dressed in a lion-skin carrying a dead ox, and also the lenticular chalcedony (p. 84)=an asinine figure supporting a slain goat. The first of these Island stones came, I have said, from Phigaleia; and it is fortunate that Pausanias has a full description of the ancient worship 318 Milchhbfer, Anfiinge der Kunst, p. 55, Fig. 44A: Overbeck, Griechische Ktunstmytho- logie, Bk. iv. p. 683, Fig. 3. 319 Milchhdfer, op. cit. p. 55, Fig. 44c: Over- beck, op. cit. p. 683, Fig. 1: Helbig, Bulletino dell'Inst, Arch. 1875, p. 41.</page><page sequence="59">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 139 which obtained in that town. His account is interesting, and I may be excused for quoting it at length, if I can show that the details which he gives put us on the right track for interpreting the curious symbolism of the above-mentioned gems. He writes (VIII. xlii.) as follows:- 'The mountain Elalon is distant about thirty stadia from Phigaleia, and contains a cavern which is sacred to Demeter surnamed Melaina. Now as for the tale told by the men of Thelpusa concerning the wedlock of Poseidon and Demeter, the Phigaleians agree with them. Only, the latter hold that the offspring of Demeter was not a horse, but she whom the Arkadians name Despoina. For the rest, they say that, partly through anger against Poseidon, partly through grief at the rape of Persephone, she donned a black robe and entering this cavern did not show herself for a long time. So, when all the produce of the land was wasting away, and the human race suffered yet more heavily from famine, none of the gods knew where Demeter had bestowed herself. Pan, however, came to Arkadia, and went a-hunting now on one hill now on another: when he reached Elaion he there caught sight of Demeter, and discerned her form and the manner of her raiment. Zeus having heard the tidings from the lips of Pan sent the Moirai to Demeter. To their voice she hearkened, and relaxed her wrath and laid aside her sorrow. This is the cause which the Phigaleians allege to explain why they deemed the cave sacred to Demeter and set up therein a statue of wood. The following was the fashion of their statue. It was seated upon a rock and except for the head resembled a woman. It had the head and the mane of a horse, forms of snakes and other wild animals being attached thereto: it was robed in a chiton reaching to the feet: a dolphin rested upon one of its hands, and the bird on the other was a dove. The reason for which they made the image thus is clear to any one of intelligence and a turn for archaeology.' Pausanias then goes on to narrate that in some unknown way this ancient statue had been burnt. The Phigaleians neglected to restore it and the cult fell into desuetude, till another famine came upon the land and the Delphic oracle advised them to return to the worship l7roxEXoiv, Aqoo;. They thereupon induced Onatas, the Aeginetan sculptor, to make them a fresh statue; and he made a bronze 'ryaX/a on the model of the ancient ?d6avov. 'It was mainly for the sake of this Demeter'--continues Pausanias--'that I came to Phigaleia, and following the custom of the inhabitants made no burnt-offering to the goddess; for they place upon the altar that is before the cave the fruits of tame trees, in particular of the vine, and honeycombs and unused wool which still retains its o'iovrro9; and having placed these there they pour olive oil upon them. These rites are performed both by private persons and in public every year by the Phigaleians. The performant is a priestess, and with her the youngest of the so-called lepoOlJ;a(, who are three of the citizens. There is a grove of oak-trees about the cave, and cold water wells up from a spring. The statue made by Onatas was no longer extant at the time of my visit.' Pausanias' allusion to the legend of Thelpusa is explained by his words in VIII. xxv. 4 ff.:-' Passing Thelpusa the river Ladon flows to the temple</page><page sequence="60">140 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. of Demeter at Onkeion. The Thelpusians name the goddess Erinys; and with them agrees Antimachos in his poem describing the Argive attack on Thebes; his verse runs thus- " There they say is the shrine of Demeter Erinys." Onkos is reported to have been a son of Apollo, and lord over the Thelpusian territory near Onkeion. But, however that may be, the goddess has the surname Erinys. For when Demeter was wandering in search of her daughter, it is said that Poseidon courted her; and that she, turning into a mare, pastured with the mares of Onkos. Poseidon, perceiving that he was the victim of guile, changed his form into that of a horse, and met Demeter. At first Demeter was provoked at the deed, but after a while she ceased from her anger; and they tell how she was minded to bathe in the Ladon. Hence came the goddess' titles; Erinys on account of her wrath, because the Arkadians say Jptvletv for 'to be angry'; and Lousia because she bathed in the Ladon. The temple-statues are wooden, their faces hands and feet being of Parian marble. The statue of Erinys holds what is called the iKoTrry and a torch in its right hand; I should conjecture that it was some nine feet high. The height of the Lousia appeared to be about three feet less: those who hold that this statue represents Themis and not Demeter Lousia may be sure that they are at fault. Further, they tell that Demeter bore to Poseidon a daughter whose name they will not declare to the uninitiated, and also the horse Areion; on which account they were the first of the Arkadians to give Poseidon the title of Hippios. As proof of this they cite verses from the Iliad and the T'helaid. In the Iliad occurs this mention of Areion: "Not even if he drave goodly Areion, Adrastos' swift steed, who was of birth divine." And in the Thebaid, when Adrastos fled from Thebes- "Gloomy raiment he wore, with Areion of the raven hair." The verses hint, then, that Poseidon was the father of Areion. Antimachos, however, says that Areion was the child of Earth : "Adrastos son of Talaos son of Kretheus was the first of the Danaans who became famous by driving his steeds, swift Kairos and Areion of Thelpusa, whom Earth herself sent up hard by the grove of Apollo Onkaios, a marvel for mortal eyes." But even if the horse did spring from the earth, his race might still be considered divine, and his hair of a dark colour. The following tale is also told: that Herakles when warring against the Eleans begged the horse Areion from Onkos, and thus riding upon him captured Elis; and that subsequently the steed was given to Adrastos by Herakles. Hence Anti- machos wrote of Areion- " Who was once tamed by King Adrastos,after serving two chieftains."'</page><page sequence="61">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 141 So far Pausanias: the gist of his twofold version may be put thus- (1) The Phigaleians worshipped Demeter Melaina in a cavern near their town. This Kcpv-7T'ptov vrpov, as the Pythia termed it, contained an old cultus statue with a horse's head. (2) The Thelpusians recognized a shrine of Demeter Erinys at Onkeion, where her statue held a torch in its right hand. (3) The inhabitants of both localities agreed in stating that Demeter as a mare had been wooed by Poseidon as a stallion. From the union sprang Despoina (according to the Phigaleians), or a nameless daughter and the horse Areion (according to the Thelpusians). It will be well to collect further evidence on each of these points with a view to discovering the significance of the equine form which characterizes the whole legend. (1) The cave-cult of the horse-headed Demeter is corroborated by certain coin-types of the neighbourhood. There are specimens of Thel- pusian mintage, which have been described as follows :320 Obv.

(2) On other coins of Phigaleia322 Demeter holds a torch in either hand, and recalls Pausanias' account of the statue at Thelpusa. As Demeter Erinys she would naturally bear these symbols of the underworld. It is noticeable, too, that-just as the Phigaleian Demeter is clad in a black chiton-so Greek tradition makes the Erinys or the Erinyes- IedhvaLyL. . . . . . Aesch. Sept. c. Theb. 699.

In fact, there is every reason to suppose that both at Phigaleia and at Thelpusa Demeter was worshipped as a Chthonian goddess. (3) This is borne out by her liaison with Poseidon Hippios. The two deities are more than once found together. It was at Poseidon's well that the women of Eleusis first danced and sang songs to Demeter.323 They were 320 Imhoof-Blumer and P.

Poseidon's horse was, like himself,327 directly Chthonian in character: it came forth from the ground when its creator, in his contest with Athena, struck the Akropolis rock with his trident. What could be more natural, therefore, than that the horse-Denmeter a Chthonian goddess should be united to the horse-Poseidon a Chthonian god, and that the offspring of their union should be the horse-Areion ' whom Earth herself sent up2, a marvel for mortal eyes'? In brief, the prominent figure throughout the Arkadian legend is the horse, and the horse as symbol of the nether world. If, then, the details of the Phigaleian gem are to be systematically investigated, we must proceed by examining somewhat narrowly the nature and functions of this animal. The monumental evidence for its Chthonian office may be thus sum- marized :- (a) A primitive tombstone relief (circ. 550--500 B.c.) found at Chry- sapha 32 represents the heroified dead on a lion-foot throne receiving oblations: the field is occupied by a trotting horse. (,8) On sepulchral monuments of the 'Early Attic' class the portrait of the deceased is often accompanied by the diminutive figure of a youth riding or leading a horse: this has sometimes 329 been taken to denote 'the favourite pursuits or the knightly rank of the dead person.' Decorative stelai of a later date, which are to all appearance adorned with scenes from daily life, occasionally introduce figures of horsemen. (7) From the fourth century onwards, a horse's head appears looking through a window in a common 330 type of relief known as the 'Sepulchral Banquet.' Another variety gives more prominence to the horse. The deceased 'hero' is seen either riding on or standing by a horse, while he receives a libation from an attendant female.331 The meaning of these types has been, and still is, hotly contested. We shall probably be safe in concluding that on funeral monuments belonging to class (a) or class (7) the horse symbolizes death; while on stelai of class (,) 324 Paus. I. xxxvii. 2. 325 Paus.

Aen. vi. 653-5. The superstition of a death-horse 332 was not confined to Greece. In Hindoo mythology, the mouth of hell is represented as a horse's head.333 And M. Reinach in his Esquisses Archdologiques (1888, p. 132) writes: 'La presence du cheval dans les reliefs grecs fundraires se constate dans les oeuvres etrusques de la meme famille; en Itrurie plus clairement encore qu'en Grace, le cheval parait en rapport avec le monde des enfers.' Turning from the monuments to literary sources, we again find the horse connected with Chthonian powers in general and Poseidon in particular. I would ask attention to a section of legendary genealogy that had won acceptance from the Greeks as early as the days of Hesiod. Oceanus-the tradition ran-married Tethys, and among the numerous offspring of the marriage were several whose names have an interest for us; Electra, Hippo, Philyra, Polyphe, and Ladon. To trace first the descendants of the Oceanid Electra. She wedded Thaumas, or as others said Typhon; and from the wedlock334 resulted a strange progeny of Harpies. Their number is uncertain, and their names vary; but probably we can distinguish Aello, Okupete, Kelaino and Podarge, with Iris as their sister. Here we are already confronted by the figure of the horse. For Milchhofer conjectures that Iris was of equine form; and it seems certain that such was the nature primitively attributed to her sister Harpies. Homer, at any rate, in Iliad xvi. 150, tells how Xanthos and Balios, the horses of Achilles, were born of Zephyrus by the Harpy Podarge. The words /3oaxcopulvr XesCou~w used of the latter hint at a horse's shape. Moreover, the poet held the Harpies to be 'only impersonations of the storm-winds,' 135 as will be at once clear fron a comparison of Odyssey xx. 66, c, 8' 0Te IIavpape'ov ovpaq dvE'Xovro OveXXat, with line 77, which refers to the same incident- rT4pa &amp; -r7a ovpaq ~p7rvtLaL avpel-4avzro, Ical P c ocaav o-TVEp9o-tLv eptvi-tv /.C4L7atroXeVItELv. And the assignment of a horse-form to the Winds is common enough. In the Delos akroterion for example, which depicts the rape of Oreithyia by 332 In Theocritus, xv. 40, the baby is fright- ened by the words : MopWdc, &amp;ICeLt '1 7r ro s. Does the word tirros here refer (like Mopud) to some goblin ? ass See De Gubernatis, op. cit. vol. i. p. 333. 334 Acc. Servius on Verg. Aen. iii. 241, the parents of the Harpies were Pontus( = Poseidon) and Terra (= Ge); the other version is, how- ever, supported by Hesiod, Apollodoros, and Hyginus. In either case a marine origin is given. 3~" Merry on Horn. Odyss. xx. 77.</page><page sequence="64">144 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE.

The 8voalae&amp;ca rrw^oot, who thus skim the cornfields and the sea, certainly denote the sweeping winds: and the epithets of sombre colour (IvavoXailvrq, KeXaivw, and the like) may be indicative either of their dark Chthonian origin,337 or-and this I suggest as being more probable-of the unseen force of the winds themselves. To the early mind darkness and invisibility are much the same thing.338 To deal next with the branch of the family derived from the Oceanid Philyra. She was loved by Kronos who, the legend said, courted her under the form of a horse. To them was born the centaur Cheiron; and thus we are introduced to another remarkable relic of horse-worship, the 01ao-os i7rwro/fd-ra9 KEvrav7dp (Eur. Iph. Aul. 1059). A variant legend made Cheiron the son, not of Kronos but of Kronos' son Poseidon, whose con- nection with the horse was well-established. Pindar 339 makes mention of Irrwrdpxov Hoeet&amp;awovoq, whom he elsewhere 40 calls wrrro8pdoitov. Lyco- phron 341 terms him "rI1ry/rys; and the tragedians 342 in general know him as 'IrT7rtoS. These titles are born out by several myths: (a) Poseidon, as we have already seen, approached Demeter Erinys as a horse. It has been pointed out343 that this Poseidon-and-Erinys myth appears also in Sanskrit story. According to the Rigvedas, Vivasvat and Saranyfi (= Erinys) in horse form gave birth to the As'vins, twin horses or knights, who on Greek soil are represented by the Dioscuri. The Arkadian tale made the children of Poseidon Hippios and Demeter Erinys, Despoina and the horse Areion. 336 Miss Harrison, Mythology and Monuments, p. lix. if. 337 Cp.

(7) Poseidon became by Alope the parent of Hippothoon 345 or Hippo- thoos, who was twice suckled by a mare.346 (8) He also loved the daughter of Mestor and Lysidike, whose name Hippothoe proclaims her affinity. Moreover (e) Harpokration tells us that by the Oceanid Polyphe or Koryphe-for the name varies-Poseidon became the father of Athena Hippia :- 'Irrrlwa 'AOrOv^i- 'I aoog d o T' 7 rp KaXv8U~va.

Athena also bore the significant title of Chalinitis; and on one famous occasion received the offering of a 8ovpdreoI ~wtrow-probably an image of herself.349 Pausanias 350 remarks that this title Chalinitis was adopted because 'having tamed Pegasus she delivered him to Bellerophon, and placed the bridle on him with her own hands.' Here again the horse seems to be emblematic of the sea. Bellerophon's father Glaucus (a local appropriation of Glaucus the ocean-god 351) fed his mares on human flesh, and-according to one version of the legend-was devoured by them after they had been maddened by drinking of a sacred well at Potniae : as FXai"Koi Tapdt'rrrow he was supposed to haunt the Isthmus of Corinth and frighten the horses during the races. Bellerophon himself was originally called Hipponoos, and was by some reputed to be the son of Poseidon: his own son was named Hippolochos. Finally, Ladon, another child of Oceanus and Tethys, married the nymph Stymphalis, by whom he had three children-Daphne, Metope, and "44 Miiller-Wieseler, Denklm. vol. i.

The mention of Thelpusa taken in connection with Pausanias' story suggests some etymological meaning in the legend that Daphne was wooed by a prince called Leukippos. Subjoined is a stemma that will help to rid my account of the confusion attendant upon genealogical minutiae. I have printed in Clarendon type the names of those persons whose relation to the horse is sufficiently obvious.

The action was typical on the part of these primitive equine beings, who are looked upon as ~rvXorro/47rol,-swift unseen escorts of the departed soul.</page><page sequence="67">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 147 Later art depicted the Harpies as winged females or even as birds, assimilating their type-as Mr. Cecil Smith 352 has shown-to that of the Sirens, who performed the same r1le in Hellenic legend. On the so-called 'Harpy Tomb' from Xanthos we see these 'virgineas volucres' (Ov. Met. vii. 4) with human arms and birds' legs carrying off the diminutive dead. And a vase in the Berlin Museum 353 represents a similar figure grasping two men by the wrists as it swoops through the air. Again, a Siren or a pair of Sirens-bird-forms with human heads and arms-furnished a frequent motive for Attic tomb-decoration. Sophokles' grave was surmounted by one; and examples of the heraldic arrangement are numerous. The Sirens' music has probably little reference to 'the singing of the funeral dirge,' 354 but rather recalls the piping of the wind across the waters. In short, Sirens as well as Harpies are Chthonian escorts of the dead, embodiments it may be of the viewless storm-wind sent to snatch the living from the upper air and convey them o-Trvyepj0artv 'dpiV5ov /07roXE'etv. Having thus surveyed the nature and office of the Chthonian Horse, let us apply our results to the explanation of the Island stones. That these illustrate the Phigaleian cult, whose relations we have been examining, seems clear from several considerations. The first gem was found at Phigaleia itself; and the second derived from Crete, which according to Apollonius Rhodius 355 was the home of the Harpies. Again, the figures garbed in horse-skin cloaks and wearing horses' heads and manes aptly correspond to Pausanias' description of the old cultus-statue at Phigaleia, which 'had the head and mane of a horse...and was robed in a chiton reaching to its feet.' The substitution of this black chiton for the black horse-skin is paralleled by the Brauronian cult, in which the goddess Artemis obtained the sobriquet Chitone from the chitons dedicated to her in lieu of bear-skins. Two points still await solution: (1) the fantastic fusion of bird-legs with horse-heads, which reminds us of the oriental Hippalektruon ;356 and (2) the character of the central figure on the Phigaleian gem. (1) From what has gone before it seems plausible to suppose that the horse-forms have bird-legs because they are representatives of a power that was sometimes embodied as a horse, sometimes as a bird. The Harpies, origin- ally conceived as horses, were in later times represented as birds. Nor need we be surprised that the two shapes are here combined.357 We have already discovered examples of this compendious symbolism, the horse with bird- legs being strictly analogous to the ass with lion-legs. This seems to me at any rate a more probable hypothesis than Milchhofer's view that the bird-legs 352 J.H.S. vol. xiii. pp. 103-114. 35 Cat. No. 2157. 354 Mitchell, op. cit. p. 495. 355 Ap. Rhod. ii. 298. 356 Roscher, Lex. col. 2663, a b. f. vase = nude man riding on horse-headed Hippalektruon. Lnucian, V.HI. i. 13, speaks of Irvroy-pavoL and Lr4r-yv7roL, but he means merely birds ridden as though they were horses. 357 The archaic statue at Phigaleia, while it retained the head and mane of a horse, bore the bird as a separate symbol in one hand. This was apparently mistaken for a dove (the emblem of wedlock) by Pausanias. L2</page><page sequence="68">148 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. of the horses and the back-pieces of the other animals were borrowed from the locusts, which the forefathers of the Mycenaeans may have encountered in their wanderings. His argument that the horse originally denoted a cloud, and that the locust-band is the most dangerous of all clouds, is hardly convincing. (2) The second point is less easy to determine. We have little to guide us except the similarity that subsists between the 'schema' of the Phiga- leian horse-gem and that of the Orvieto bull-gem. The latter, which depicted a nude man grasping by the horn a pair of bulls, I took to denote the supremacy of the celebrant over the waters of Poseidon. And I am disposed to interpret the present device in like manner as a man obtaining the mastery over two equine figures symbolical of Chthonian power. Their tongues hanging out and the position of their arms indicate the struggle of some fierce monster, reluctant to be tamed. It is possible that the scene finds mythical expression in the stories of the horse Areion and the horse Pegasus. On the coins of Thelpusa (p. 141) the former was represented as bridled; and-in the words of Antimachos-he 'was once tamed by king Adrastos, after serving two chieftans.' The XaXlvo-atv of the latter is well known. In any case I should interpret the trorocaduLa of the Phigaleian gem to denote the subjugation of death. In the nude man grasping two Chthonian beings I see the converse of the Berlin vase mentioned above, which showed a Chthonian being grasping two nude men. As yet we have not raised the question whether these equine figures represent worshippers or the object of their worship. In favour of the former supposition is the general similarity of the present gem to others already examined, and in particular to the Orvieto stone on which it was obvious that the cq6e 0o olvoXooV00VTe of Poseidon's festival, who bore the title of Traipot, were portrayed as actual bulls. It is true that no record has been preserved of human 'wwrot,358 but then it was by the merest accident that Athenaeus mentioned the Ephesian cult, and in the present case the long cloak fastened by a girdle, as well as the human arms, point to a similar explanation."39 The occurrence of these human arms on a horse's body suggests a possible corroboration of my theory. Mionnet360 describes a coin of Gordianus Pius struck at Nikaia in Bithynia, the reverse of which has the legend InnON BPOTonOAA NIK&lt;AIEON and represents:- ' Heros a cheval, la tote couverte du bonnet phrygien, et tenant de la main droite une couronne; le cheval, dont les pieds de dcvant sont hunains, 358 Pliny, iv. 95, speaks of certain fabulous islands ' in quibus equinis pedibus homines nas- cantur Hippopedes appellati.' Cp. Berosos, Frag. i. 4, ed. Miiller. 59s There is a striking analogy between both these groups and that depicted on the Assyrian slab (p. [57]). In each case one human being is represented as taming or restraining two animal-figures. The lion-form, grasping his jaw with his hand, bears a close resemblance to the action portrayed on our horse-gem. It is conceivable that the three lepoet'rat mentioned by Pausanias (p. [92]) were wont to enact this scene-one taking the part of the ftrdsaAos, the others being the 'hrroL. 360 Mionnet, Mddailles Antiques, Suppl. vol. v. P1.

Mr. B. V. Head (Hist. Num. p. 443) reads the type somewhat dif- ferently :- 'Divinity riding on a horse whose right foreleg is formed like a human arm, which grasps the serpent-staff, and whose left foreleg ends in a human foot, the tail of the monster is a serpent; this curious type has never been explained.' To the same effect Drexler in Roscher's Lex. col. 2690: 'Eine Erklirung des Typus ist noch nicht gefunden.' Now Nikaea, as Mr. Head says, 'was built by Antigonus circ. B.C. 316 on the site of the ancient Ancore.' It is, then, possible and even probable that this unique type goes back to a primitive cult resembling that of the Phigaleian Demeter: indeed other coins of Nikaea bear the inscription OEA AHMHT. It will be remembered that the horse-head statue on Mt. Elaion had 'forms of snakes...attached thereto': for the snake, like the horse, was a regular Chthonian animal. It occurs on the earliest funeral relief found at Sparta in the place occupied later by the horse; and appears not unfrequently along with that animal in the 'Sepulchral Banquet.' 361 Further, the serpent twined round a staff is borne by 'Epl~ws XO'vtos in his capacity of *vXOorowo drws. It would seem, therefore, that the Nikaean horse, which grasps the serpent-staff and has a serpent for tail, must be identified with the Chthonian horse, the normal escort of the dead in their journey to the underworld. But the coin-type attributes human forearms to this animal, and moreover represents it as ridden by a man who bears a victor's wreath. This surely means that a human being symbolically portrayed as the Chthonian horse is subjugated to his rider.362 In short, I submit that we have here a collateral relic of the Phigaleian rite, in which men dressed in horses' skins and furnished forth with the emblems of death were overpowered by the celebrant,-the purpose of the performance being to secure by mimetic magic immunity from danger. The Cretan gem indicates that propitiatory offerings of slain beasts were made to the same equine daemon. Finally, the subjugation of the Chthonian horse or rather of his human representative seems to have spread to the West as well as to the East. From a grave at Chiusi comes a platter of black ware, published in the Annali dell' Institut. for 1877.363 Inside the rim runs a design of which no solution has been forthcoming.

Then comes a male figure grasping by the ears a horse-headed man, whose crouching attitude betokens submission or servitude.

The significance of the whole composition remains doubtful; but the central group-which bears a striking resemblance to the motive of the Phigaleian gem-may be provisionally interpreted as the ceremonial subjugation of a man wearing the mask of the Chthonian horse. VI.-THE CULT OF THE GOAT. atkS 7T rXcevp~yr ~ 0opah aiyTcv Kca7rcrpLIov.- THEOGNIS, 55. The next cult to claim our attention is that of the goat. I have already referred to two gems which represent human beings clad in the wrporo,4 of this animal. The first is a carnelian from Athens (p. 116): it shows a couple of men dressed as lion and goat respectively. The second is a porphyry from Crete (p. 120), on which a pair of human legs is combined with the forepart of a goat and the forepart of a bull: this design-as I tried to show- probably denotes two men in animal attire; between their legs is a notched shield. So far as I am aware, there is only one other Island stone which portrays the goat-man in a similar fashion. I allude to a serpentine from FIG. 20. Crete (Fig. 20), published by Otto Rossbach in the Annali dell' Inst. for 1885,364 on which is graved the forepart of a goat conjoined by means of a girdle (' una specie di anello') with the legs of a man, in much the same attitude as the 'monster' on the stag-gem previously described. The field is occupied by a star and a shield of the sort mentioned above. The early prevalence of the goat-cult is deducible from the traces which it left in classical mythology. The principal indications may be grouped as follows:- (1) Athena was worshipped in Attica as a goat-goddess. This is proved, partly by her aegis or goat-skin garb, partly by the fact that the goat being her especial protdgd was never sacrificed to her.365 That the primitive inhabitants of Attica should have worshipped the goat appears very natural, when we reflect that one whole division or caste of the population was 364 Vol. 57, P11.

(2) Dionysus and the Dionysiac attendants-Pans, Satyrs, and Sileni- were constantly regarded as goats, probably in their character of woodland and harvest divinities.366 (3) Artemis was locally known as Kva~/ia, KvaKaXjo-'la, and Kvaxei-tv.s67 Many ancient terra-cottas and marbles represent her accompanied by a goat, and a silver medallion from Herculaneum 368 shows her head between two goats rampant to r. and 1. (4) Hera was called Aryo daryoq at Sparta. Tradition said 369 that her cult there had been founded by Herakles who, after his expedition against the sons of Hippokoin, first sacrificed a goat to her, because she had not opposed him. An amphora in the British Museum (Cat. of b.-f. Vases B 57, page 66; Gerhard Aus. Vas. ii. No. 127) shows Herakles with club upraised advancing towards Hera, who bears a large round shield on her left arm, poises a spear in her right hand, and wears over her head the skin and horns of a goat. Behind Herakles stands a female figure: behind Hera, Poseidon, who carries a trident with spear-head at lower end. Between Herakles and Hera, as also between the latter and Poseidon, is placed a caldron with four snakes. Juno Lanuvina, Hera's Italian counterpart, is normally draped in a goat's skin with long goat-horns. This is seen to best advantage on those monuments which represent her in combat with Hercules. Several of them are figured in Roscher, Lex. coll. 2262, 2263, 2265; but the clearest specimen is one drawn by Miiller-Wieseler, Denlcmnler i. No. 299b. (5) Aphrodite Pandemos was conceived as a goddess riding on a goat,s30 which animal has in this connection a phallic significance. Possibly this is a clue to the amphora in the British Museum (Cat. of b.-f. Vases B 254) which represents Poseidon riding in a quadriga with ' Aphrodite,' who wears an aegis; Mr. Walters, however, considers the name a mistake for 'Athena.' At any rate Roman coins of the gens Fonteia 371 show Cupid seated on a goat with a thyrsus beneath it. And Martial (VIII. li. 9, 13) describes a cup by Mentor which bore as its device a winged Amor riding a goat. (6) Hermves, to whom young goats were offered, was said to have begotten Pan in goat-form. He too is sometimes depicted as mounted on a goat.372 (7) Zeus Kretagenes was brought up by the nymph Amaltheia, who fed him with the milk of the cave-goat Aix or Aiga. Subsequently Zeus slew Aix in order to wear her skin as an aegis, when attacked by the Titans; 36 The Golden Bough, vol. i. pp. 326-8 ; vol. ii. pp. 34-7 : Roscher, Lex. coll. 1038-9, 1059. We have already remarked that at Potniae a goat was sacrificed to Dionysus Al.yo60'Aos in lieu of a human victim, p. 106; Pauly, Real- Encycl. ed. 2, col. 976. 367 Paus.

Zeus rewarded Aix with a place among the stars. A variant legend made Amaltheia herself the goat. We cannot, indeed, pronounce with certainty that our Island stones illustrate any of these fragmentary notices. Nevertheless, reasons have been given for supposing that the first Cretan gem was connected with the cult of Zeus Kretagenes, whose sacred animals were the bull and the goat. It was further suggested that this would account for the presence of the notched shield as part of the device. Now Rossbach's serpentine likewise comes from Crete and bears a notched shield. It is therefore possible that it has reference to the same cult. The provenance of the first goat-gem (Athens) points to some connection with the worship of the goat-Athene. But in that case the presence of the lion-figure is unintelligible. Assuming that the two are not independent fancies of the artist but symbols of the same deity, I would suggest that they have a Dionysiac meaning. At any rate, both the lion and the goat were sacred to Dionysus. The Maenads, who in their orgies rent live goats asunder (alylt'tv), are akin to Agave who exults over what in her madness she takes to be a lion's head. In both cases it is the divine animal which is slain. But, whatever be the precise cult or cults to which these gems should be referred, I cannot doubt that they represent human beings dressed in the skins of goats. Hesychius tells us that the Bacchants wore goat-skins (s.v. TpayrTdpot); and the ritual which survived in the case of Dionysus may well be a relic of a more wide-spread practice.

After what has gone before it; will hardly be denied that this design (Fig. 21) has a religious significance. The human legs; the girdle (which appears just below the body of the ox); the trailing cloak of hide-all the details in fact point to its representing a man dressed in a pig-skin garb. The spines or tassels down the back of the figure are conventional bristles. With them may be compared the bristles of the wild boar on a glandular gem from the Peloponnese; 374 also the horse's mane on a fragment of fresco from Mycenae,37"5 discovered by M. 37 Milchhifer, Anfdnge der Kunst, p. 80, Fig. 51; Middleton, Engraved Gems, p. 20. 374 Milchh6fer, op. cit. p. 92, Fig. 59b. 375 'EpLuepls 'APXatoAo-Yuc4, 1887, P1. 11.</page><page sequence="73">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 153 Tsountas; or again, the spines down the back of a figure clad in bear's skin, drawn by Micali.376 But though the gem in question 377 is obviously a cult- gem comparable with those which we have already examined, to elucidate its details is not easy. FIG. 21. Our one clue is that it seems to have come from Crete. Now Athenaeus (375 F ff.) remarks:- 7rrpt E o pv T LePd V L " b T o v 7r a p a K p n a p v 'AyaOoAXi7 0 Ba9vgXvLo, do ? p' rrept Kvlxov rqOlv obi'ro 'WOEU ova-v dv KpTry yevea-Oat 7Tv ?At b TE'/C o-V (o t 71i1 AlKTcr% Ev y Icat La7rpprTO cylVETaL Ova-la.

Here, then, we have direct evidence for supposing that the pig was worshipped by the Cretans in connection with the legend of Zeus Kretagenes. And since we have found (p. 131) that deity appearing in bull-form apparently as a god of vegetation, it is possible that the pig also to whom the Praisians sacrificed was an embodiment of Zeus as a corn-spirit. This would not be without a parallel. Mr. Frazer has rendered it all but certain that Demeter 378 and Persephone, as well as the Phrygian Attis and the Syrian Adonis, were originally conceived as pigs. And of Dionysus, another vegetation-god, Nonnos writes:- El tp aq ta-Ioaro Trt) a- v o s4, vla O (v(r aco-w, 7roOlovTa "avoIcdov eEvyapov Ai p`v, *tFry,6Vov 7pLTCTOLO Kv/V7Xi8a T'pa Bao'cGov. Dion. i. 26ff. But, whether Zeus Kretagenes was a corn-god or not, he seems to have been worshipped both as bull and as pig. Of the former aspect of his cult I have already spoken at length: and for the latter the passage from 37 Mon. Ant. Pl. 15. 377 It belongs to the large private collection of Mr. A. J. Evans, to whose courtesy I am indebted for the impress from which Fig. 21 has been drawn. 37s The Golden Bough, vol. ii. p. 49 ff.</page><page sequence="74">154 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. Athenaeus is sufficient voucher. It may be, therefore, that the gem which represents both these animals is to be connected with the worship of Zeus Kretagenes. At the same time we must not forget that both the ox and the pig were sacred to Demeter; and that Crete was 'one of the most ancient seats of the worship of Demeter,' "79 who bore the infant Ploutos to lasion- veLe evt TpL7r6X 2 KpTjE V rLoV ~jx.380 So that it is equally possible to explain the gem as a scene from the early ritual of this goddess; in which case the pig would again symbolize the corn. It is at least safe to conclude that the gem represents a worshipper of a Cretan swine-deity leading to sacrifice a bull, which he holds by the horns. The propriety of the victim selected lies perhaps in the fact that it is another embodiment of the same god. Whether the ceremonial wearing of a pig's skin continued into classical times, I have been unable to discover. It is to be noted, however, that at Ialysus a decree (Dittenberger, Syll. Inscr. Graec. no. 357, vv. 22 ff.; cp. no. 388, vv. 22 ff.) forbade any man to enter the temple precinct of Alektrone with shoes of pig-skin on his feet. Also we may cite in this connection the vase-painting discussed by Studniczka in the Jahrbuch for 1891, pp. 258-262. It represents Hermes with his caduceus bringing to the altar a dog dressed in a pig-skin. That this is a make-belief of the Chthonian pig seems clear from the character of its conductor. Lastly, it is conceivable that the scene in Aristophanes' Acharnians (v. 738 ff.), where the Megarian dresses up his two daughters 381 as pigs, is a parody of some religious rite.382 In favour of this is the particularity of the description :- aLXX' or &amp; Cp M1 -p a p Ka a X7 a v a.

Ion, 1161. It is time to recapitulate the results which the foregoing investigation may claim to have established. In the centuries immediately preceding the Dorian invasion (roughly from B.C. 1500 to 1000) there existed through- out the Aegean Archipelago and the eastern coasts of the Greek peninsula a wide and varied worship of animals both wild and tame. Among the former were the lion, the wild-bull, and the stag; while the latter comprised the ass, ox, horse, goat and pig. (a) Of these the ass and the lion were held to be embodiments of a Chthonian daemon, whose special prerogative was to guard the waters of the underworld. The worshippers of this daemon were wont to disguise themselves in asinine and leonine skins of an artificial sort. Apart from the mere oblation of slain beasts, their ritual involved a mystic hydrophoria and a mimetic dance. (,8) The lion also appears in connection with a tree-cult at Amyclae, and along with the goat was emblematic of Dionysus. Those who took part in the Dionysiac orgies wore the spoils of both animals. (ry) The wild-bull was the animal form of the water-god, Poseidon Taureos; his human representatives, dressed in bulls' heads and hides, underwent a symbolical subjugation, which serves to explain the wide-spread practice of the ravpoKaO~dta. (8) The ox, the goat, and perhaps the pig, were vehicles of Zeus Kretagenes probably in his character of vegetation-god. Ministrants arrayed in the 7rporo/tal of these animals masqueraded to his honour. (e) The horse was another Chthonian daemon, whose function was to escort the dead to Hades. As such he received the offerings of men dressed in equine garb, who also performed a rite similar in kind to that of the bull-worshippers and seemingly intended to secure immunity from death. ( ) Lastly, a human victim wearing a stag's head and horns was sacrificed to the wolf-god on Mount Lukaios in Arcadia. Doubtless many of the ceremonial details belonging to each of these cults have been irrecoverably lost. Enough remains, however, to justify some inferences of general application. It will have been observed that the</page><page sequence="76">156 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. cult-scenes on the Island stones may be grouped into three classes, according as the artist depicts:- i. A human being wearing the 7rpoTop of an animal over the upper half of his body, to which it is secured by a girdle round the waist. [See exx. of Ass (p. 81, fresco), Lion (pp. 115, bas-relief; 116), Ox (p. 120), Stag (p. 133), Horse (at Phigaleia p. 139, Nikaea p. 148, and Chiusi p. 150), Goat (pp. 116, 120, 150), Swine (p. 153).] ii. An animal wearing its own rpomrop' in the same fashion. [See exx. of Lion (pp. 104, 106), Bull (p. 120).] iii. One animal wearing the 7rpoTop' of another. [See exx. of Ass + Lion (p. 84), and Horse + Bird (p. 138).] It seems at first sight plausible to suppose that intaglios of class i. represent the worshipper of the animal, those of classes ii. and iii. the animal or animals worshipped. But further reflection shows that such a hypothesis is untenable. And for this reason. An animal dressed in a man's clothes, or a man dressed in an animal's hide, is a comparatively simple mode of expressing the relationship thought to exist between the two. But that an animal should be attired in its own hide is from this point of view inexplicable. Hence in class ii. the animals so portrayed must not be considered as mere animals, but rather as symbols of men called by animal-names, the ritual garb and act being retained in oirder to differentiate them from ordinary beasts. This explanation is supported on the one hand by the literary preservation of such animal-names for the devotees of animal-gods-c.g. JPicKTO and VXovzTc, Taipot and Xaabo--; and on the other hand by the frequent symbolism of the Greek artists who represented Aecov of Sinope as a stone lion, Adatva of Athens as a bronze lioness. Again, the third class of engravings, which portray one animal wearing the wrpoTro, of another, is on this showing not less intelligible. Given that the Cyprian X'OVTcr worshipped a daemon which appeared at one time as an ass, at another as a lion; was it not natural to represent them as lions dressed in asses' skins ? That we are on the right track in thus interpreting the animal figures of classes ii. and iii. as symbols of men called by animal-names, is indicated by the fact that such figures occasionally bear vessels in human hands, e.g. the asses on pp. 81, 84, the lion on p. 106, the bulls on p. 120. It would appear, then, that in these pre-Homeric cults the celebrants were wrapped in the skin and called by the name of the animal they worshipped. Thus attired they performed their respective rites-the hydrophoria, the mimetic dance, the mock subjugation, and the animal sacrifice. With regard to the last we see: The lion (p. 84) and the Gretan goat (p. 84) offered by Asinine figures: The ox (p. 106) offered by a Leonine figure: The Cretan goat (p. 120) offered by a Bovine figure: The stag (p. 138) offered by an Equine figure: The ox (p. 153) offered by a Swine figure,</page><page sequence="77">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 157 Now all this-it might be urged-is in favour of concluding that to the early inhabitants of the Aegean these animals were not only objects of veneration but also totems. For in totemic tribes- (1) 'The clansman is in the habit of assimilating himself to the totem by dressing in the skin or other part of the totem animal' :383 and this is exactly what was done by the Mycenaean worshippers. (2) The totem, if it be an animal, must not be slain: and we note that on our gems in no case does the offering brought by an animal figure resemble the offerer (and, by implication, his deity) in kind. (3) 'The clansman also affixes his totem mark as a signature to treaties hand other documents'': " and this explains the occurrence of the cult-scenes on the Island stones, which were certainly used as signets. (4) ' In death, too, the clansman seeks to become one with his totem':315 and we recall the fact that in the largest shaft-grave at Mycenae two metal masks were found, an ox-head of silver and a lion's-head of gold. Moreover, sundry superstitions of the later Greeks point in .the same direction. To the evidence quoted by Mr. Frazer 816 may perhaps be added the coincidence that- (5) Just as some totem clans 'are careful not to speak of their totem by its proper name, but use descriptive epithets instead,' 3s7 so 'the oracular and sacerdotal' 38s phraseology of the primitive Greeks used e.g. avz6o-reo = cuttle- fish, t'8pSp = ant, cepeotxo- = snail. Are we, then, to decide that the Mycenaean celebrants were totemists ? Not, I think, without qualification. Fully to establish that proposition, it would be necessary to prove that among them a man (a) might not marry a woman who worshipped the same animal, and (8) might under no circum- stances kill and eat the body of the beast whose kinship he claimed. On both these points our data are very limited but, so far as they go, tend to refute the supposition:- (a) With regard to the marriage restriction, it is known that 'no man would marry a girl who had not been a bear'389 at the Athenian ,ip'reia ; but this is not decisive either way, as it is uncertain whether the said man and girl were both bear-worshippers. The animal genealogies on pp. 125, and 146 are, if I am right in my interpretation, against the totemic pro- hibition; but here again the evidence is unsatisfactory, since the connections may be mere figments of later pvOowrotowl who-as Pausanias (I. xxxviii. 7) remarks-'when they have nothing to go upon for their genealogies, think it well to invent fresh ones.' (3) In dealing with the second question we are on more certain ground. It is true, on the one hand, that the cult-scenes of the gems do not represent e.g. a bull killed by a bull-man. 383 Frazer, Totemism, p. 26. 384 Ibid. p. 30. 385 Ibid. p. 36. 886 Op. cit. pp. 15, 33, 34, 40, 41, 79. 387 Ibid. p. 15. 311 K.

It is true also that the Cretan swine-worshippers abstained from eating swine's flesh.390 Further it is noticeable that Mycenaean remains, which furnish several clear instances of the ceremonial wearing of artificial masks and cloaks, have hitherto yielded no certain case of an actual skin being so worn. This fact admits of two explanations. Either the artificial cloak was a civilized substitute for a more primitive hide: or the counterfeit garb was original and deliberately adopted in order to spare the life of the sacred animal. Against the former of these interpretations I would urge that actual skins are known to have been worn by the later Greeks in certain religious rites, civilization notwithstanding. And the latter construction supports the view that the animals worshipped by the Mycenaeans were. genuine totems. But again we have to weigh conflicting evidence. For, on the other hand, that a swine-figure should sacrifice a bull (see gem on p. 153) to a deity who appeared now as a pig, now as a bull, would have been contrary to totemic principles :391 and the same may be said of the oblation of lions by an asinine figure (see gem on p. 84), and perhaps of the slaughter of a goat by a bovine figure (see gem on p. 120). Still more impermissible must have been the sacrificing of the totem itself.392 Yet it is certain that in later times stags were burnt at the Laphria to the stag-goddess (p. 134); just as sheep in Cyprus were slain to the Cyprian sheep-goddess (p. 106). Moreover, such epithets as alyoodayol or veupo- Kcrvov discountenance the idea that the gods so known were regarded as true totems. On the whole, I gather that the Mycenaean worshippers were not totemists pure and simple; but that the mode of their worship points to its having been developed out of still earlier totemism. The main modifications introduced into that prehistoric system were, on the one hand the permission to marry within the limits of the clan, and on the other the exaltation of the totem to the rank of an animal-god. The latter step brought with it the oblation of what had once been the totem animal, now regarded as the favourite or symbol of the god. Henceforward the totem- clan was supplanted by the clan of animal-worshippers, who perhaps recognized a subdivision of the cult-duties in some sort corresponding to the social organization of the totem-clan. At least Porphyry in his account of the Diipolia observes that 'Those who are descended from Sopatros who struck the ox are all called Bouphonoi, and those who are descended from the man who drove the ox round are called Kentriadai, and those who slay the ox are called Diastroi.' Whether the animal god was himself conceived as bestial or as human is a question which I do not propose to discuss at length. Such indications as exist point to the latter view. Strict animal-worship could hardly have 390 Athenaeus, loc. cit. p. 153. 391 Frazer, op. cit. p. 88: 'It seems a fair conjecture that such multiform deities are tribal or phratric totems, with the totem of the tribal or phratric sub-divisions tacked on as incarna- tions.' 392 Mr. Frazer tells me that among purely totemic tribes there is no certain example of the sacrifice of the totem animal. A dubious ex- ception is the turtle-sacrifice of the Zunis.</page><page sequence="79">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 159 amalgamated with alien and imported divinities of an anthropomorphic type. But, given that the animal-god had come to be credited with human attributes, the fusion of religions which seems to have taken place at Mycenae is natural enough. Moreover, there is direct evidence to hand. Certain gold ornaments brought from Rhodes by Messsrs. Salzmann and Biliotti represent a winged female with outstretched arms, who from her waist downwards has the body of a bee. In other cases the humanity is complete. Herakles, whose genesis from a lion-cult we have already traced, appears as a man on a very early lenticular steatite in the British Museum. A woman-figure flanked by a pair of lions is also a frequent motive. And deities both male and female occur holding in either hand a long-necked bird. These examples suffice to prove that anthropomorphism had begun to assert itself, while as yet the more primitive theriomorphic cults had not fallen into oblivion. In brief, the Animal-worship of the Mycenaean age must be considered intermediate between Totemism and Anthropomorphism : its ritual relates it to the former; its conception of the animal-god to the latter. APPENDIX. BY way of Appendix I may be permitted to add a few words on a question intimately associated with the previous discussion. If animal- worship in general and the wearing of skins in particular played so important a part in Mycenaean times, what traces did it leave on the life of the later Greeks? The indications which I have noticed fall under two main heads- (1) religious superstitions, and (2) social practices. I shall enumerate them with all brevity. (1) a. The legendary evidence for the foregoing cults furnished not a few instances of human beings partially or wholly transformed into animal shape. Midas in the Phrygian myth receives asinine ears; and Lucius in Apuleius' tale is turned into an ass. Hippomenes and Atalante become by the fiat of Cybele lion and lioness. Hera changes the Proetides into heifers,393 Io into a cow. Artemis transforms Actaeon, Taygete, and Cos, into stags. Finally, there is the legend of Circe:- 7 p.otL oai .v l Ocar pe 6eyEt potoav &amp;Eraipovl ........ pa 8 av` e avoeltov, dX 3' e'Xaov cra-tdXota-tv .Eol.cra EVVecfpOL otv. HoM. Od. x. 338, 390. These stories, with the doubtful exception of the last, should be regarded as relics of animal-worship. Man conceived as the servitor of the animal- 93 Another version states that Dionysus, not Hera, effected the transformation: Apollod. ii. 2 ? 2, Diod. iv. 68</page><page sequence="80">160 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. god is invested more or less completely with animal attributes, and at death assumes the animal shape. Indeed, I think we may venture on the general statement that within the bounds of Hellenic mythology animal-metamnorphosis commonly points to a preceding animal-cult. ,8. Secondly, certain superstitions current among the Greeks with regard to the cure of madness presuppose the same stage of religious development. Prof. A. A. Bevan was, I believe, the first to remark the parallelism between Oriental and Hellenic notions on this subject. The Eastern potentate is represented as saying: 'And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me.' (Daniel iv. 34.)

Madness, then, is cured by looking at the sky. But for what reason ? The explanation is-if I am not mistaken-to be inferred from another passage of Euripides.

Of Nebuchadnezzar it was decreed: 'Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him' (Dan. iv. 16, v. 21); 'he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen' (Dan. iv. 33); his</page><page sequence="81">ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. 161 portion was 'with the beasts of the field' (Dan. iv. 23).

I gather, then, that the special form of animal-mania was attributed to a temporary possession by an animal-deity. It was cured by looking up at the sky, because 'animalia suppa'-as Lucretius calls them-normally look downwards,"' so that the tendency to animal acts would be counteracted and the sufferer humanized 395 by looking upwards.396 7y. Thirdly, it was widely believed that to wear the skin or some portion of an animal was to become endowed with its peculiar virtues. Pliny's recipes often put in requisition the hides of asses (ed. Harduin, vol. ii. 486, 15), bulls (ii. 538, 18), stags (ii. 588, 33), goats (i. 667, 30: ii. 460, 18 ; 536, 36), or sacrificed animals in general (ii. 751, 2). And Greek amulets from Mycenaean times downwards have been made to represent various animal shapes. But in the open sea of superstition it is impossible to distinguish the contributions of particular rills. It will be better to turn our attention to those social customs which more definitely betray the influence of the Aegean cults. 39 car$A'irwv is the name of an African buffalo in Aelian and elsewhere. 35 Man, says Aristotle (de part. an. r 662b 20), Sth ib 4dvov 4p0g elvYes rrv (cwy p/dvo rpoGowOEv b'irwnE.

The animal disguises of the Mycenaean age were worn, so far as we can judge, on occasions of religious importance-sacred dances and ceremonial oblations. Where the god was supposed to appear under more semblances than one, the celebrants would dress some in this way, some in that. A carnelian from Athens (p. 116) showed two figures clad in the 'po-ro/al of a lion and a goat respectively; a serpentine from Crete (p. 120) similarly displayed a bull- and goat-man. These mummeries seem to have survived in several localities, probably retaining something of their religious character. My evidence on the point is as follows:- i. In the 'E byiep'V 'APXatLOXOUC' for 1888 M. Tsountas published a series of Island stones discovered during the excavations at MAycenae. Among them is one 397 which has not hitherto met with the recognition it deserves. It is described as a haematite cylinder having a series of figures, viz. a human figure, with short tunic and cap; two figures similar to the last, but having each two ox-heads; and a fourth figure with the head of an antelope. There are also two birds and two ox-heads in the field. It should be observed that the xt'r 'v /paXL" is composed of some hairy stuff with projecting spines, apparently in imitation of an animal's hide; and that the Janiform ox-heads are merely the engraver's device for showing both sides of the face. ii. The Athenaeumn for July 1, 1893, p. 39, announced the discovery near the ancient city of Hierapytna in Crete of a large marble slab, decorated with two rows of animal-headed dancers: 'human bodies with heads of men, dogs and eagles.' No detailed account of the find has as yet come to hand. iii. M. Cavvadias, in the first instalment " of his long-promised Fouilles de Lycosoura, calls attention to the figures represented on a fragment of drapery from the statue of Demeter. Eleven forms with female bodies in tunics have the heads, hands and feet of various animals, as of the ass, the horse, the bear, the ram and the pig. They play various musical instru- ments and dance. '... Ces figures ont certainement un rapport avec le culte et avec le mythe local concernant les deesses Lycosouriennes... Quant aux figures a totes d'animaux, elles nous rappellent la metamorphose, d'apres la .. tradition locale, de Demgter chang6e en cavale pour eviter les poursuites de Poseidon.' Dr. Waldstein, in the American Journal of Archaeology for 1890,389 speaks of them in similar terms as 'curious hybrid beings, or perhaps a scene of metamorphosis, running figures changed into animals.' My own view is that they represent a local dance in honour of the god- dess, at which animal-masks were actually worn. And the same explanation would satisfy the other examples mentioned above. s'7 PI. 10, No. 38, p. 179. 118 Livraison, i. 1893, pp. 11-12, P1.

In Athenaeus Deip. 424 E we read:- wvvOc&amp;vo/at 8' 7ywrye ica' E'ptrlj87v Pv rroT;rv olvoXoeiv 'AOrjovy- 70Oti Opo-rraT tKaXov/ voLq. 0p)oPTro 8E o'oTt rwept T7v roil 'AwrdXXwvo9P verv r70 AJXiov rwv srproOv 6vteo 'AOlYvalo a da E ovov to Ltrolrta TroWv Orq p a t Ic WP v. This is usually taken to mean that the dancers wore garments of the sort manufactured in the island of Thera. But, apart from the a priori im- probability of such a custom, the said garments were known not as ?7patcd but as O4pata (Pollux vii. 48, Oepaov lUpdrtcov, dErb 7r7o vjo-ov, 4 7T O S OqpLov Edvvao'-pvov; Etymn. Mag. p. 85, s.v. 'Ap6prytwoq; C.LA. ii. no. 374; Schol. Ar. Lys. 150). Hence I infer that the original reading in Athenaeus loc. cit. was O27ptaKc6v, which was subsequently altered to OpaK6icv in order to suit the better known O?pata.400 If' this be so, the animal garb worn by the celebrants very possibly resembled the cases already quoted. However that may be, these mummeries seem to have been developed in two direc- tions-secular and religious. /8. On the one hand, losing something of their ritual character, they gave rise to that mode of dancing which Athenaeus (629 F) calls ~opoacp-'l and Pollux (A 103) defines as 'a mimicry of all manner of animals.' The beautiful astragalos from Aegina, which J. Six in the last issue but one of the J.H.S.401 takes to represent 'Aurae velificantes sua veste,' affords an example,402 and may be most plausibly explained as a dance of girls imitating the flight of birds-possibly the yXa^: dance of Athenaeus, loc. cit. y. On the other hand, from the religious dance accompanied by music it is but a step to the dramatic chorus. A mimetic dance marked by signs of merriment-e.g. the I'op a? represented on the Mycenaean fresco-would readily take on the form of caricature and become the precursor of Comedy. More dignified performances-e.g. the shield-dance of the goat-deity-may have furnished the prototype of Tragedy. Such at least was Aristotle's view : Poet. 1449a 9 yevo/~yr] obv p r' pX? aVToo-Xe8tao-rtcc, Kcat a-rj (sc. 77 Tpay7pla)-Kcai t Ko)Lcq8(a Icat Ka pea4 br rT&amp;v GapXovrwv oTv S tOpap3ov, 4 400 In suggesting this restoration I see that I have been forestalled long since by Casaubon. 401 J.H.S. xiii. p. 134. 402 A cock-dance by Phrynichus is mentioned in Aristophanes' Wasps, 1490, leoioeL pg6YLXOS COs -rs eiccop. Similar ?&amp;op(paxo-to[ were prac- tised by mediaeval jugglers. The Daily Tele- graph for Sept. 15, 1893, notes : 'In a Bodleian manuscript of the fourteenth century there is a picture of a man disguised as a stag, who is dancing to the sound of a tabor played by a boy, and in the same collection there is repre- sented a goat walking on its hind-legs. Bears, pigs, and mastiffs were commonly simulated, but none of these fictitious animals had any fore-legs, staves of wood being supplied as a substitute upon which the actor could lean when he was tired, while his face was seen through an aperture in the breast.'

But if this be the genesis of the drama, a simple explanation suggests itself for the dramatic practice of wearing prrporrona. It is difficult to believe that, apart from some religious association, these masks could have been retained by the dramatists of the fifth century: 403 'Better, quite cast off the face-disguise And voice-distortion, simply look and speak.' Aristophanes' Apology, p. 37. If, however, they were an integral part of the mimetic rite, we can under- stand that to neglect them would be reckoned a grave breach of social etiquette. Hence I suspect that dramatic masks were the direct descendants of the earlier ceremonial disguise. The point is not without an interest of its own, and calls for less summary treatment. It is probable that their origin will appear more clearly in Comedy than in Tragedy, because the former remained in a primitive and unsophisticated state longer than the latter:- Ar.

It will, therefore, be reasonable to begin by inquiring whether the disguise of the comic chorus resembles that of the animal-dancers described above, and is susceptible of a religious explanation. Now it is not a little remarkable that among the known specimens of the Older Comedy so many have animal-names. Magnes o? exhibited BdrpaXot, 'OpvtOel and T^ves, ' in which the choruses imitated the sounds' of these animals.405 Ekphantides 06 wrote ,drvpot; and Kratinos407 the elder followed his example. Krates composed "Opvtuel,405 and a curious drama entitled6 Oqpia, 'in which the golden age was painted with animated and docile furniture instead of slaves, and without animal food - since the chorus of beasts protested against it.' 409 A fragment 410 of their protest is extant : Kah TwZw ^VacbcoYwv ecw Xpl 1XOB 7T' 7rrT^v row "re rapiXov, YI~zv a' r'o Xetpa9 "eXefaOat. Eupolis wrote the famous Ales, in which 'capras chori partes sustinuisse constat ex Plutarchi Symp. iv. 1, Macrobii Saturn. vii. 5, Eustath. ad Iliad. 403 It has indeed been supposed that they served to increase the resonance of the human voice, but actual experiment proves that even in the largest Greek theatres the ordinary tones of a speaker from the AoycZov would be audible to the furthest seats. 4o Meineke, Com.

Platon's TPpvre9 413 and M`p1rcKq 414 may also be mentioned--though the latter is possibly to be identified with a play of the same name by Kantharos,415 who is further known as the author of the 'Ai7ovel. Kallias416 issued a second BdirpaXot before Aristophanes appeared with his B`drpaXot,"OpvB0e9, IeXap- yol and E1K9e.

Lastly, Kephisodoros 420 composed a 'Tq. How the animal-chorus was in each case represented may be best realized by the aid of vase-paintings. In the Bullettino archeol. napolit. N.S.V. 1857 (P1. VII. p. 134) Minervini discussed a vase portraying two such scenes.421 One of them shows a chorus of ostriches, the other a chorus of dolphins: in both a flute-player is present. In the J.H.S. for 1882 422 Mr. Cecil Smith published an oenochoe from the Burgon collection and an amphora of Gerhard's, which depict men dressed up as birds dancing to the sound of a flute: they recall Plautus' line: 423 'Sed quaenam illaec avis est, quae huc cum tunicis advenit ?' Such representations, it will be observed, are virtually indistinguishable from from those of the ritual dances mentioned above. I infer that the animal- disguise of the comic chorus, whose religious associations were never wholly forgotten, is a survival of primitive animal-worship, the original import of the disguise being to claim the protection, if not the kinship, of the animal god. In the case of those animals whose skins could not be worn, the disguise would be effected by painting or other means. Aristophanes (Knights, 520 ff.) speaks of Magnes, whose Bd'rpaxot we have already noticed, as parrd7Fpevo9 3arpaxelot9.

This would no doubt be considered the equivalent of a mask; 424 and it is probable that where no animal-garb was worn, i.e. where the god was not worshipped as theriomorphic, some such disfigurement was always retained.

I conceive that this smearing of the face with the lees of the wine-god was in- tended to serve much the same purpose as the animal-disguise. In Tragedy the link with the past is not so easily detected. Literary composition had fostered anthropomorphism, and the /.palpro- did not often demand other than human masks. Still, it may be surmised that the form of these, which 'appear generally to have covered the whole head like a visor,' 410 betrays their origin. Again, 'one of the most characteristic features of the tragic mask was the onkos. This was a cone-shaped prolongation of the upper part of the mask above the forehead, intended to give size and impressiveness to the face.' 431 It seems to me possible that in this onkos we have a relic of the elongated animal-head, or even of the crest which we noticed on the Island stones in the case of the ass, lion, and horse. Occasion- ally the tragic mask was still more realistic: 'Actaeon had to be represented with horns, Argos with a multitude of eyes. Evippe in the play of Euripides had the head of a mare. A special mask of this kind must have been required to depict Io with the ox-horns in the Prometheus Vinctus of Aeschylus.' 43 The Arch. Zeit. for 1878 43 published, among others, a mask surmounted by an eagle, from a Pompeian wall-painting. Lastly, the Satyric drama shows traces of the same origin. The dress of its satyrs consisted in 'a rough goat-skin round the loins, with a tail hanging down behind.'434 Their masks were 'provided with a shock of bushy hair, and exhibited coarse and lascivious features.' They seem also to have indulged in animal postures, one of which 'was called the a/-c' or o-lc7rev/La, and is variously explained by the old grammarians as having 42 Ibid. i. 538-9. 427 With this may be compared the use of wfrxds at the Eleusinian initiation: Dem. 313, 16. 428 Bekker, Aneed.

The wearing of sacrificial skins during religious rites may be con- nected with the practice of wearing them in war. The underlying idea would be the same in both cases, viz. that of putting oneself literally and metaphorically under the protection of the animal-god. It is, for example, easy to see how the worshippers of the horse might ally themselves, so to say, with their deity by wearing his skin in battle.436 In fact Herodotus (vii. 70) actually describes the custom. 'These Aethiopians from Asia'--he remarks-' were for the most part equipped like the Indians, but they had upon their heads the skins of horses' foreheads flayed off together with the ears and the crest; the crest serving in place of a plume, and the horses' ears being fastened upright.' To come nearer home; the Revue Aqrcheologique for 189043 published a fragment of green schist covered with reliefs of a quasi-Mycenaean style, on which we see a procession of warriors. 'En arrihre tombe un curieux appendice, que l'on ne peut mieux comparer qu'a une queue de renard, a laquelle seraient encore attenantes les deux pattes posterieures de l'animal...Tout bien examine, il y a l~ un travail de hachures obliques et parallhles, qui indique la dipouille de quelque animal &amp; queue fournie...Dans une figure il semble mime que l'on distingue la tate de l'animal.' 4as Again, on a vase-fragment found at Tiryns we have two warriors 'from whose hips hangs down a long strip which has been explained, probably correctly, as the tail of an animal's skin thrown over their back.'"43 The inconvenience of such a costume would ensure its ultimate rejection; but the tenacity of tradition usually retains some emblem of the past. Alexander the Great was often portrayed wearing a lion's mask, or a head-dress composed of an elephant's scalp; and coins of Seleucus I. represent that monarch in a helmet adorned with the horns and ears of a bull. The mintage of the Roman gens Marcia 440 shows the head of Philip, King of Macedon, with two goat's-horns on his forehead. Parallel customs prevailed among the Italians. The Pontifices and Salii had fur caps made of the skins of sacrificial victims. The early inhabitants 441 of Latium wore a very similar animal-cap by way of helmet- 'fulvosque lupi de pelle galeros Tegmen habent capiti' (Verg. Aen. vii. 688). Again, 'the standard bearers on the arches and columns are universally represented as Vegetius describes them (Mil. ii. 16), with a close scull-cap over which the head and skin of some wild beast is drawn, so that the face appears through the gaping jaws.' 442 It is curious, too, how favourite among 435 Ibid. p. 291. 436 Frazer, Totemism, p. 26. 437 Vol. xv. pp 145-152, P11.

Ant. s.v. 'Galea pellibus tecta.'</page><page sequence="88">168 ANIMAL WORSHIP IN THE MYCENAEAN AGE. the Romans was the Greek design of Herakles wearing the lion's mask. It occurs on coins of the gens Aburia, Acilia, Caecilia, Cornelia, Curiatia, Curtia, Domitia, Fabia, Fabrinia, Licinia, Livineia, Maenia, Marcia, Minutia, Numitoria, Opeimia, Papiria, Pinaria, Pompeia, Pomponia, Rubria, Servilia, Sextilia, Sulpicia, Terentia, Trebania, Vargunteia, Volteia: also on the 'Roma,' and consular coins. Scarcely less common is the head of Juno Sispita wearing her goat's skin and horns. She appears thus on coins of the gens Cornuficia, Julia, Mettia, Papia, Procilia, Roscia, Thoria; and on consulars. A coin of the gens Calpurnia 43 oddly enough shows 'Junonis Lanuvinae caput quod perperambarbatum fingitur'! An inspection of Morell's draw- ing will satisfy us that the head is male, not female, and probably represents a priest of the goddess arrayed in sacrificial garb. Another skin-clad figure on Roman coins is that of Africa wearing an elephant's mask: see the gens Caecilia, Cestia, Eppia, Norbana,-also sundry consular coins. It occurs too on Graeco-Roman gems 444 and other 445 objets d'art. Lastly, the animal-disguise dwindles to a mere emblem or device worn on the helmet or engraved on the shield. Numerous examples may be found in any treatise on ancient weapons; indeed, the custom survived far into the middle ages. e. Another trace of primitive skin-wearing is to be found in the numis- matic symbols of certain cities. Just as the warrior adopted the animal- garb for his armorial bearings, so the community to which he belonged took it for their monetary token. This is, I think, a plausible explanation for the strange un-Hellenic half-creatures which occur so frequently as early coin- types. The fore-part of a lion is found on the currency of Miletus, Cnidus, Leontini, Acanthus, and Lycia: of a bull on that of Phlius, Samos, Acanthus, Larissa, the Perrhaebians and Lycia: of both these animals facing each other on that of Lydia: also the forepart of a winged lion appears on coins of Lycia and Lesbos. Coins of Apollonia and Corcyra show the forepart of a cow. Cyme, Zacynthus, Pharcadon, Pherae, and Maroneia have the front half of a horse ; Lesbos, Larissa, the Perrhaebians and Cleitor that of a bridled horse; Zacynthus that of a winged horse. Lycia has the foreparts of a bull and a horse, back to back. Cyzicus, Lycia, Phocis, and Lesbos show the forepart of a boar; Samos that of a winged boar. Aegae and Mysia have a half-goat: Sicyon a half-chmiera: Argos a half-wolf: Cranium and Pheneus a half-ramg. : Psophis and Selge a half-stag : Lycia a half-griffin. Similarly the type of Stymphalus is the front half of a bird; while there are coins of Crannon, Pherae, and Tricca, which for obverse have the forepart of a bull grasped by a youth and for reverse the forepart of a horse. The design may have passed through further stages, since not only animal-heads, but also animal-scalps are used for the same armorial purpose. 443 Morell, op. cit. Tab. iv. 2. 444 Brit. Aus. Cat.

It is in this way that we should probably explain the animal-titles attached to certain early Greek townships and tribes-a custom caricatured in the 'TTTat, 'OveaTat, and Xotpe6aTra at Sikyon. A. B.
