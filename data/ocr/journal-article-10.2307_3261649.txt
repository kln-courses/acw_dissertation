<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS standing of his career than most whole books ever achieve. The chapter alone is worth the book. The final part of the study is "The Man in Christ." It represents Dr. Knox's grasp of the theological and religious significance of Jesus for Paul, which he ightly regards as the climactic fact about such a work. Paul had become ar new creation as a result of the revelation of Jesus in him; he was a man "in Christ" by way of his birth in the spirit. When he said in Galatians, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me," he was putting into brief words the whole religious experience of his life. The whole section is on a par with the two preceding ones, even if more briefly treated, and the entire book lays all serious students of Paul under deep obligation to the author. It will almost certainly remain a standard study of Paul for a long time to come. Incidentally, the publishers have done very well in the make-up of the book. It is convenient in size, with excellent pagination, good type, wide margins, pleasing to the eye, and well-bound - such items as have been too often missing in good books in the last decade. CHARLES F. NESBITT Commentary on Romans, by Anders Nygren. Translated by Carl C. Rasmus- sen. Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1949. Pp. 457. $5.00. Bishop Nygren agrees with Luther that in Romans we have "the clearest gospel of all." It is not that the Synoptic account of the Gospel is wrong; it is merely "easier to distort" than Paul's account, which is "more clearly and unequivocally" expressed (p. 2). The fundamental concept of the Epistle, to which Nygren returns times without number, is "the righteousness of God" or "from God," whose normal antithesis is "the righteousness by the Law" -a man-made and therefore ego- or homo-centric product (pp. 11 ff., 18, 74, 161, 317 f., et al). These two concepts respectively characterize two aeons, the "age of Adam" and the "age of Christ," which the author finds described in 5 12-21 - a passage which for him is the pivotal portion of the Epistle and about which all the remaining portions revolve, much as ch. 15 of I Cor. represents for Karl Barth the kernel of that Epistle (pp. 19 ff.). The theme of the Epistle is found by the author in 117, which he wishes to read: "He who through faith is righteous shall live." This, of course, is not particularly original, but the drastic use he makes of the idea is so. For 283</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE he divides the first half of the Epistle into two main parts, in accord with the reading of this text, the first being from 1 18 to 4 25 with the caption "He Who Through Faith Is Righteous," the second from 5 1 to 8 39 with that of "He Who Through Faith Is Righteous Shall Live." Part Three (91-11 36) follows under the heading, "The Righteousness of Faith Is Not Against the Promise of God," and Part Four (12 1-15 13) under the title, "The Life of Him Who Through Faith Is Righteous." The conclusion (15 14-16 27) Nygren believes to have been a part of Romans from the beginning, including the doxology, the critical grounds for suspicion regarding the same being dismissed in a manner characteristic of his treatment of like problems with the state- ment that they "do not seem well founded, when examined closely" (p. 457). Probably Nygren is right in his employment of the term "righteousness of God" to characterize the teaching of the Epistle, rather than the now out- moded distinction between Justification and Sanctification. Certainly his adherence to the Pauline terminology serves to maintain the unity of the argument presented in the Epistle. His further development of the argument as indicating how man through Christ is set free successively from God's Wrath, from Sin, from the Law, and from Death is also in the present writer's judgment entirely sound. And there is much more in this worthy volume to commend - for example, its author's definition of Paul's view of Scripture (pp. 83 f.), his apologetic for Paul and his teachings (pp. 454 et al), his em- phasis on the "historical Jesus" (p. 238), his treatment of the relation of Time to Eternity (pp. 340 et al), of the "time" of the Wrath (pp. 99 ff.), and of "freedom from Sin" (pp. 241 f., 267), and much of his exegesis. Nonetheless, the commentary leaves much to be desired. For (although Bishop Nygren would no doubt disclaim this) I do not find that he has been able to escape the anti-psychological, anti-ethical, and anti-scientific tend- encies of modern continental theology. These tendencies crop out again and again, as for example in the uncritical approach to the Epistle and its con- stituent parts referred to above (cf. also pp. 10 f. on Jesus' and Paul's use of "righteousness"), in the bias against a "Christ-mysticism" (p. 237) and against a "natural theology" (p. 104) and a "natural ethics" (p. 122), and in the examination of 7 14-25 (pp. 284 ff.; cf. esp. p. 292). Nygren's conclusion that the last-named passage represents the "Christian" Paul's experience of the dualism of "will" vs. "action," of "intention" vs. "performance," is too shallow, whether judged from the standpoint of psychology or of Paul's use of his terms (flesh, mind, members, body); cf. p. 293. Nygren himself admits (p. 438) that "mind" and "action" are one and cannot be thus opposed as 284</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS descriptive of a true "Christian" experience. (Incidentally, his statement on pp. 437-440 is extremely good as a summary of Paul's ethical teaching in Romans - better than much that went before on the subject!) This leads one finally to observe that, despite Nygren's prolixity, in the end he does not adequately define such important terms as "righteousness," "flesh," "body," "faith," "in Christ." Far too much space is devoted to say- ing what these terms do not mean and far too little as to what they do signify. To take but one example, it is not adequate to remark that " 'unrighteousness' is not, for Paul, a moralistic concept. Its opposite is not human righteousness, man's moral well-doing, but the righteousness of God" (p. 110), and much more to the same effect. For what is the "righteousness of God" but the Bib- lical term for the normative "moralistic concept" for man? Doubtless it is much more than that; but it is at least that. The moral concept is not to be defined by reference to anthropomorphic customary human action, as by both Greeks and Romans -granted. How then is it to be defined, but by the theomorphic righteous action of God, as with the prophets of Israel? Both "righteousness" and "unrighteousness," then, instead of being emptied of all meaning whatever, are to be defined as "moralistic concepts" which de- rive their true meaning by reference to the moral Person of God.

From Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Roman parallels it is asserted that the motif of the mock king comes out of the sphere of ideas connected with the Oriental New Year's festival. Apparently the author is not contesting the historicity of the incident, but merely suggesting that the soldiers, far from being inventive in their mockery, were only follow- ing a pattern of familiar custom. 285</page></plain_text>
