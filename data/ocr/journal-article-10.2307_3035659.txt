The curlew has long served poets as a symbol, its cry a voice calling us to feel the spirit of nature, the larger world in which we exist but yet remains too often a mystery. For the cry of the Eskimo curlew might only have been heard in passing as it pursued its annual 18,000-mile migratory cycle between the Arctic tundra and Patagonia, a voice forever silent now that the Eskimo curlew is extinct. It is no sur- prise, therefore, that poet W S Merwin was drawn to a forty-year-old edition of this book on a friend's shelf. It is to him that we owe thanks for this elegant reissue, which looks and feels like a gift in the hands. Fred Bodsworth, a Canadian writer who has pub- lished many books and articles on natural history, allows us to go along for the ride, so to speak, and to contemplate the hazards and rewards of the imagined flight of the last curlew to make its yearly journey. His narration is neither anthropomorphic nor overly sentimental, but gives a convincing por- trait of the behavior that distinguishes this particu- lar species from other shore birds. In order that his readers may understand what happened to the curlews, Bodsworth alternates be- tween fictional chapters and excerpts from objec- tive accounts beginning in the 18th century of the slaughter of these birds and observations concern- ing their diminishing numbers.

Bodsworth's alternation between fictional narrative and expository text, framed be- tween the two-culture comments of poet and physi- cist, underline the universal importance and appeal of this little book.
