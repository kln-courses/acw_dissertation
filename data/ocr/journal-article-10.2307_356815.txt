<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION THE NORTON ANTHOLOGY OF MOD- ERN POETRY, ed. Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair (Norton, 1973, 1456pp., $9.95). WESTERN WIND: AN INTRODUCTION TO POETRY, ed. John Frederick Nims (Random House, 1974, 466pp., $4.95). Robert O'Clair is chairman of the English department at Manhattanville College. Rich- ard Ellmann need hardly be identified, hav- ing written the definitive biography of James Joyce and, more recently, Ulysses on the Liffey. Together O'Clair and Ellmann have produced one of the finest anthologies of modem poetry in many a year. This book even feels good. Norton obviously took great pains in printing this remarkable volume. The heft is just right, and the pages turn easily, making it reminiscent of an expensive Bible. It seems a pity that it was not bound. with a flexible Moroccan cover. But enough of the physical attributes of the book. It is a text. A text that is to be used by college students, not bibliophiles. A text that will be scribbled in, tor, and in some cases eventually thrown away. What then is in this expensive paper- back? To answer this, one must discuss the word "modern." In the very first sentence of the introduction, the editors admit that it is not easy to determine when poetry be- came modem. It might be argued that modem poets go back to the Romantic movement, when individuality was not seen as an eccentricity but as a positive quality. O'Clair and Ellmann use the term "guerrilla poet" to refer to this "outcast, victim, misfit, radical," who achieves heroic consequence. But some poets have repudiated their Romantic origins, the editors point out. Yeats called himself one of the last Roman- tics. Eliot repudiated the entire nineteenth century. One must remember the energy with which the Edwardian and Georgian poets tried to throw off the cloak of Vic- torianism. In what at first might seem a paradoxical statement, O'Clair and Ellmann contend that "there were modem poets before there was modem poetry." Whitman stood "mono- lithically at the threshold." Not that all those who followed were modems, anymore than that all the poets after the Lyrical Ballads were Romantics. Cutting literary movements into neat little segments is a tricky game, and all Who do so leave them- selves open to attack. Dickinson had, of course, much influence on the modem poets. She wrote of her world as a microcosm, while Whitman saw a macrocosm. In the introduction to Miss Dickinson's poems, O'Clair and Ellmann quote from a letter of hers that contends she never read Mr. Whitman "but was told that he was disgraceful." A third precursor of the modem move- ment was that non-Victorian Victorian, Ger- ard Manley Hopkins. He had written in a letter that he felt Whitman's mind to be more like his own than like any other living man's but felt that since Whitman was a "very great scoundrel this is not a very pleasant confession." Why did Hopkins feel that Whitman was a scoundrel? O'Clair and Ellmann contend that Hopkins's judgment was influenced by Whitman's homosexual leanings (how much ink has been spilled on this subject as well as on Hopkins's bruited similar leanings?) and unChristian religion. Hopkins found in God what Whit- man found in the world's coherence. The editors see Hopkins's attempt to transform the apparatus of poetry as an attempt to re- symbolize the world. "He did not desert rhyme or meter, but he pulled, twisted, and stretched them like nerve ends until they looked like nothing seen before in English verse. O'Clair and Ellmann discuss in detail the influence of symbolism on modem poetry. Baudelaire's Flowers of Evil was published two years after Leaves of Grass. Oddly enough, the French symbolist was influ- enced by Edgar Allan Poe, whose works he translated. The term symbolism became popular in France in 1886 and ten years later crossed over to England. Arthur Sy- mons wrote a book entitled, The Symbolist Movement in Literature, and in 1899 his friend and one-time roommate, Yeats, pub- lished The Wind Among the Reeds, "a book of poems which was the culmination of the early symbolist manner." It is this year that the editors have.chosen to date the beginning of modem poetry. The selections of poets and poetry are generous, making this a large book (nearly 1500 pages). The beginning selections are from Whitman, Dickinson, Hardy, and Hop- 84</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS kins. Of particular interest is the inclusion of Hopkin's "Wreck of the Deutschland," written on the occasion of the death of five Franciscan nuns. This poem is rarely an- thologized. Yeats occupies over fifty pages of this work, covering forty years of his poetry (1889-1939). The notes to his poems are not only copious but helpful. Other poets of the early twentieth century are well represented, such as Eliot (the footnotes to The Wasteland are superior), Pound, Joyce, Frost, Jeffers, etc. However, the most inter- esting aspect of the book is the section dealing with the post-World War II poets. Younger poets of the Forties included are Eberhart, Shapiro, and Jarrell. From the Fifties, there are Wilbur, Nemerov, Simp- son, and Hollander, not to mention the Beats. O'Clair and Ellmann have given the reader a good selection of Beat poetry. There is Ginsberg's "Howl," without the asterisks. The importance of this poem has been mostly ignored until fairly recently. Then there is Corso's wonderful "Marriage," the reflections of a young Beat about to lose his freedom. "Should I get married? Should I be good?" The grilling of the suitor by the parents is universal in its description. "When she introduces me to her parents/ back straightened, hair finally combed, strangled by a tie,/ should I sit knees together on their third degree sofa/ and not ask Where's the bathroom?" Gary Snyder's Pacific Northwest and Japanese poems are here, too. (It is disappointing that none of Kerouac's poems are included. Gary Snyder was the "Japhy Ryder" of The Dharma Bums.) Many contemporary United Kingdom poets are represented, most of them prob- ably unknown to the average American student, which, of course, is all the more reason to study them. Ted Hughes is in- cluded, although one begins to wonder how much of his reputation is based on his having married Sylvia Plath, who is also in this anthology. The Black poets included in this an- thology are Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, and Imamu Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones). As the blurb on the back cover claims, the footnotes, biographical and critical in- troductions make it possible for students to use this book at home without the aid of reference works. This anthology is well worth the money and should be considered not only as a text but as an invaluable addition to any teacher's library, irrespective of the area of specialization. John Frederick Nims is the author of four books of poetry, has been on the staff of Poetry for several years, and is presently teaching at the University of Florida. "Why another introduction to poetry?" he asks in the Preface. In answering this ques- tion, he argues that his approach is differ- ent. It attempts to show that poetry is something beyond the three-hour credit class that meets at 10:00 MWF. Nims argues that poetry is related to the sciences and that studying the "technical" aspects of poetry is merely studying the technique, just as we would study the movements of a pass receiver, a mechanic, or a baker. He claims that teachers for too long underesti- mated their students, believing that because the students use such expressions as "Far out" and "Like wow, man" (an expression that is more properly relegated to the Fifties, it might be added), these students are in- capable of understanding the techniques of poetry. At the end of each section are exercises, not so much geared to test the knowledge of facts but "to lure the student into think- ing creatively." Nims breaks down the sec- tions of the book into such categories as "Senses," "Emotions," "Words," "Sounds," "Rhythms," and "The Mind." Under "Senses" he discussed simile, meta- phor, analogy, and allusion, using such di- versified poets as Gary Snyder, Pope, Sap- pho, and Jeffers. Nims has arranged his quotations on pages with special borders designed to make the quotations stand out. The reader may simply browse through the text, taking from these bordered pages what he wants. In the section on the symbol, Howard Nemerov's "Money" is used. The poem, subtitled "An Introductory Lecture," pur- ports to examine the symbols on an Indian head nickel. Another unique poem in this section is "The Dark Night of the Soul" by Saint John of the Cross, showing the soul's love for God. The section on iambic pentameter is 85</page><page sequence="3">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION well done, and the nonpoetic examples Nims uses are common enough so that the student may readily see what this meter is in ordinary speech. For example, "I'd like to introduce a friend of mine," "Deposit fifty cents for overtime," "Eleven times eleven comes to what?" In the section on rhyme, Nims argues for the advantages of it: "With it we are back once more in the world of magic and un- reason." People who object to rhyme are the same people who would object to hurdles in a race. Paul Valery said that one of the most mysterious things about rhyme "is the rage it inspires in those who fail to see its function." To give one example of the ingenuity of rhyme, Nims quotes Byron: "There's not a sea that passenger e'er pukes in/ Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine." Euxine was the classical name for the Black Sea. Rhyme also appears in slang, such as, "See you later, alligator," "After awhile, crocodile." Nims gives exam- ples of rhyme in foreign languages, such as Swahili and Gabon Pygmy. The illustrations in the text are most interesting and entertaining. They include cartoons of "B.C." and "Peanuts," Renais- sance paintings, and a reproduction of a work sheet of E. E. Cummings, showing the tremendous care he took "as he com- posed his apparently artless poems." This is the type of text that will appeal to the student who has hated poetry all his life. It simplifies much of the mystery of versification and could be used in a humanities course also. JOHN F. Cox Mohave Community College Kingman, Arizona LITERATURE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN, ed. Thomas E. Sanders and Walter W. Peek (Glencoe, 1973, 534pp., $10.95). THE MAN TO SEND RAIN CLOUDS: CONTEMPORARY STORIES BY AMERICAN INDIANS, ed. Kenneth Rosen (Viking, 1974, 178pp., $6.95). THE PORTABLE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN READER, ed. Fredrick W. Tur- ner III (Viking, 1974, 640pp., $3.95). Only a few years ago, accessible textual material for courses in American Indian literature was sparse. Now in the wake of the on-going American Indian cultural renascence, a flood of anthologies of Amer- ican Indian literature has appeared. Two of the most recent and ambitious are Litera- ture of the American Indian and The Port- able American Indian Reader. Literature of the American Indian is a unique collection in many ways. It is sig- nificantly broader in scope than previous anthologies. It is the first of the anthologies written specifically for use in literature classes. The preface and the introductions to each of the eight chapters written by the editors, themselves American Indians, go far in building a context for the material included-a feature lacking in previous an- thologies. Finally, the material is well se- lected, representing some of the finest his- toric and contemporary American Indian literature. Yet for all its strengths, the book is dis- appointing, disappointing perhaps because of the expectations it raises and does not satisfy. An example is the editors' com- mentary, strong and well phrased but often breaking under closer scrutiny. The intro- duction to Chapter One, "Pre-Columbian Religions," argues that the central Native American religious principle, "the Great Mystery" or Wakonda, stands for the mys- terious life power permeating all natural forms and forces and all phases of man's conscious life and that this life power can- not properly be crystalized into the anthro- pomorphic God or "Great Spirit" of Western religions. "Wa'kon-tah lacks image, being all things," write Sanders and Peek; yet in the first selection in that chapter, "The Cheyenne Account of How the World Was Made," we find Maheo (the Great Mys- tery?) waving his arms and pulling out rib bones in the most anthropomorphic fashion. Or again in the "Winnebago Origin Ac- count," given later in the chapter, Earth- maker (the Great Mystery?) sits alone in space with tears flowing from his eyes. In what sense does the Great Mystery lack image if he has arms and ribs and cries? Is this inconsistency due to some native transformation of the Great Mystery into the form of the Christian God? Or is it due to inadequacies of translation? The editors give us no comment. The question of translation is raised at 86</page></plain_text>
