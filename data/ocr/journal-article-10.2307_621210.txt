<plain_text><page sequence="1">CERTAIN UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY By K. G. T. CLARK' The excavation by verbal tools of the underpinnings of our arguments in human or, if you prefer, social geography would manifestly be much easier if only we could always say what we mean, and others could always understand from the words we use what we mean to say. Such problems are inherent in the use of language, but they seem to have an unfortunately high incidence in human geography. One has in mind particularly phrases used to signify the primary objectives of our work, and others which are taken to indicate the essentials of our procedures. Such lack of clarity, admittedly very difficult to eradicate, precludes sound method, encourages unordered diffusion of effort, and accentu- ates the difficulty of discussing the basic assumptions on which we work. The following discussion, necessarily limited in scope, is focused upon procedures which have guided the course of certain geographical thinking in the schools and universities of this country, particularly concerning the logical relations between human and physical geography. For many people our subject has something of the nature of Siamese twins, the 'physical' and 'human' constituents being bound together by more than just a cartilaginous band to form the whole - 'geography'. Moreover it would appear that the more viable member of the partnership is the physical, for while this might survive separation from the human, the latter would seem to be 1 EDITOR'S NOTE.-This paper was originally intended for presentation at the Oxford meeting of the Institute in January 1949, but its reading had to be postponed because of the illness of Mr. Clark. It was read by Mr. Clark at the Cambridge Meeting on January 8th, 1950, and was later submitted to the Council for publication. Before the revision of the paper had been completed, Mr. Clark died very suddenly on October 16th, 1950. In the circumstances the Council decided to invite Mr. A. F. Martin of the University of Oxford to prepare the paper for publication. The Council is very grateful to Mr. Martin and also to Professor A. V. Williamson of the University of Leeds for their help at every stage. The following is a note by Mr. Martin: 'In preparing Mr. Clark's paper for publication it seemed to me desirable (a) to reduce its length, (b) to dispense with some semi-technical philosophical language, and (c) to try and bring into greater prominence the central message which the author wished to convey. 'I, have therefore, with great temerity but with the sanction of the Council, taken considerable liberties with the text. I have made verbal changes and excisions, and rearranged a number of para- graphs and sentences, but I have retained most of what Mr. Clark wrote apart from one or two passages which seemed only slightly to affect the main argument. In two places I felt it necessary to supply what seemed to me essential links in the chain of reasoning. These, the only large insertions, are indicated by square brackets in the text. 'I fully appreciate the grave responsibility I have assumed. It is almost impossible in altering another's written words to be certain that the alterations are verbal only, and do not also affect the author's meaning. In giving this careful consideration to the text I have come to realize, even more clearly than on first hearing it read, the great interest of the points raised, and the careful and sustained thought that Mr. Clark had given to them.' A copy of Mr. Clark's unaltered typescript is available in the University Library at Leeds. An appreciation of Mr. Clark by Professor Williamson will be found in Geography, 35 (1950), 256.</page><page sequence="2">16 UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY essentially dependent for its existence upon the former. For cannot certain major segments of physical geography be studied without reference to human geography? And are not physical conditions an essential ingredient of the human aspect? At least is this not true in the sense that studies which culminate in accounts of the human geography of areas have, apparently almost of necess- ity, a prologue which sets the stage in terms of physical geography? This pro- logue often goes far beyond mere description and deals with the genesis and development of the physical setting. Such a procedure clearly implies, though its author often does not in so many words assert, a causal link, or at least a correlation, between the physical 'stage' and the human activity on it. One is fully aware that it is well nigh impossible to find a methodological creed which is shared by the human geographers trained in our various universi- ties. We are tarred by many brushes. However, a perusal of papers concerned with methodological questions, of books and articles devoted to aspects of human geography, and of examination papers for intending specialists in our university honours schools (if one may assume that we teach and examine according to our faith) leaves no doubt that the environmentalist doctrine is by no means dead. We may take the essential postulate of this doctrine to be that the understanding of human phenomena is to be found through seeking rela- tions, expressed in terms of cause or of correlation, between them and the physi- cal conditions of their environment. It is a deplorable fact that, in its crudest and most indefensible form, this hypothesis permeates a great deal of geogra- phical teaching in our schools. We university geographers have at least a share in the responsibility for the views of the teachers because of the orientations given to teaching through the nature of syllabuses and through the type of questions set in public examinations. It would seem undeniable that one of the objectives of human geography should be to contribute to the understanding of certain categories of human phenomena. You may recall Professor Fleure's final plea in Some Problems of Society and Environment2 that we should search for understanding of ourselves and our fellow men. But it is a serious question whether our procedures, especi- ally those framed within some variant of the environmentalist thesis, do in fact contribute significantly towards such understanding. Are certain features of human dramas, evident now or enacted in the past, to be understood in terms of their contemporary physical conditions? Clearly the answer depends, in part, upon the meaning of 'understanding', and that raises an unresolved philosophical problem. In physical geography the attainment of understanding quite often in- volves the notion of causation; but in human geography the operative words used, when we attempt such understanding, are generally less definite and more circumspect. I do not know why causal terminology is unpopular with human geographers. Is it that we wish, at all costs, to avoid being dubbed determinists? " No. 12, Institute of British Geographers (1947), 37.</page><page sequence="3">UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY 17 Even the word correlation is infrequently used. Instead we too often adopt seemingly evasive terms such as 'the influence of' or 'the bearing of' physical conditions on human events. However, under a cloak of imprecision is not the idea of cause and effect present? Do we not, as Professor Wooldridge points out, 'on Tuesdays and Thursdays declare our freedom from any taint of the influence of influences, while on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays we "describe and try to account for" various phenomena in terms of their physical background'?" The crudest form of geographical determinism considers the influence of Land on Man, of physical on human, in terms of isolated causal series. Thus if B is a kind of human event or phenomenon, and if A is the physical conditions of its immediate environment, then wherever A occurs B should follow. A is thought of as the cause, and B the effect. I suppose all of us would agree that this determinist hypothesis, if unqualified, is contradicted by much of our experience of human events. There is, that is to say, no isolated causal chain which links A with B. In view of its manifest absurdity when expressed in such extreme form, it is no wonder that we seek to fly from geographical determinism. But clearly the discarding of that over-simple theory of causal relation does not necessarily imply the discarding of determinism as such, for this may be applied to human phenomena in terms of part causes (or plurality of causes). We may recognize that there may be determinants other than purely physical ones, and the determinist can admit that while in some instances A occurs and B follows, in other instances A is found without B, or B without A. Thus we could assert that when we proclaim 'our freedom from any taint of the influence of influences' we mean influences conceived in terms of isolated causal series, but that when we seek to 'account for' human phenomena in terms of physical conditions, our inquiry proceeds within the framework of the concept of part causes. To take a very simple example, when we say that rice cultivation (B) is found in various places (X,, X, and X3) where in each case the physical conditions are A, we do not intend to suggest that A is the sole cause of B, because we know that else- where A occurs without B. Thus we think of A as a part cause of B. Such may be a logical justification of an apparently illogical procedure. A heresy hunter might well challenge the assumption that, in terms of the above illustration, we may speak in any sense of A as a part cause of B. No possible combination of physical conditions, he might say, could in itself give rise to the cultivation of rice. This can only occur when the mind of man con- ceives it worth while to grow rice, and when he sets into operation a series of events which culminate in the crop. Thus it is nonsense to consider the physical conditions as causal; they merely form a relatively stable medium of necessary conditions within which the true, human, causal factors operate. Another line of argument leading to a similar conclusion would be to remind ourselves that as students of human phenomena we are concerned with 3 The Geographer as Scientist (1945), 22. C</page><page sequence="4">18 UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY process rather than with a static condition of affairs. If we survey the human scene over thousands of years, marked alterations of the physical background, say in climate, have occurred. If, however, the time-span which concerns us is measured only in years or decades then, apart from rhythmic change (e.g. seasons) to which human reactions are often a matter of routine, the physical background is normally relatively stable. The human and social change, however, upon this stage of relatively unchanging physical conditions is, particularly in the modern world, profound and rapid. Thus our heresy hunter might well argue that such stable physical conditions cannot possibly be considered even as part causes of the dynamic social processes. Clearly these arguments depend on distinctions within the meaning of the word cause, and they lead us to inquire what we should mean by it. In nearly all arguments about causation the idea of the cause in some way compelling the effect tends to crop up. Is there a necessary connection between what we call the cause and the effect? Is reality 'full of dynamic lines of continuous influence, streaming on and crossing, conflicting, reinforcing, interweaving in infinite variety; full of things mutually sensitive to each other . .. none that is related to others by logical reasons only'?' Or is the idea of a compelling force merely an anthropomorphic notion, a mental habit we develop from apprehending similar sequences of events occurring time and time again? Do we ourselves put the 'necessary' into what are in fact purely temporal sequences? If we take the idea of compulsion out of causation, it seems safer to sub- stitute the word correlation. But even if we assume that human geographers are seeking correlations rather than causal relations between physical and human phenomena there is a warning to issue about their common procedure. Geo- graphers do not normally use methods which in the strict mathematical sense establish correlations between the two. Usually we do not study co-variations along lines used by the statistician. Rather we seek for concomitant distributions, i.e. the existence in the same area of similar distributions of human and physical phenomena. But it is fatal to believe that concomitant distribution is necessarily or in itself proof of causal relations between the phenomena concerned. Such a correlation may just as well exist between events which lie each in independent causal series, as between other events in the same or related series. In the field of science, and in logic, a high coefficient of correlation between two phenomena is not taken as final proof of the existence of precise causal relations but only as an indication that further analytical inquiries may be worth while. Correlation, that is to say, sometimes does and sometimes does not constitute explanation or provide 'understanding'. It is clear that if we assume that reality is composed of chains or series of events which sometimes make a comparatively simple but normally a most complicated pattern, then correlation may be found between events which lie each on independent or non-convergent series, whilst causal relations, if such 4 J. B. PRATT, Naturalism (1939), 55.</page><page sequence="5">UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY 19 exist, can only subsist between events in one chain or in convergent or conjoined series. The general determinist thesis recognizes that an effect or event resulting from such a convergence has causes or antecedent events which may be traced along more than one chain. But there need be no assumption that all such ante- cedent events are equally significant as causes. In fact the reverse is usually true. [Our heresy hunter's objections may thus be resolved by taking account of the divergent causal antecedents of any event and by distinguishing between different types of part cause, such as pre-requisites, conditions or occasions, all of which are required to constitute the full cause which alone can necessitate the effect. Thus the stable physical background may well provide the pre- requisites or conditions though not the occasion of a dynamic social process. But this solution leads into the further difficulty that in seeking to 'understand' or explain human phenomena or events we are not capable of analysing or comprehending the whole complex of part causes responsible, but must perforce attempt a simpler explanation.] Our explanation, that is to say, requires us to recognize and select the most significant determinant or determinants out of the many series of part causes; this is an intricate problem, especially since the experimental method is impossible. The difficulty to which I wish principally to draw attention, a difficulty which has been recognized by some geographers, but which has never been adequately faced, arises from this need to select the significant out of a multitude of part determinants. If we use the environmentalist thesis, if we assume a connection between human and physical phenomena, we must keep constantly in mind that this involves the pre-selection of the class of determinants which we are going to consider as significant. We do not start with open minds to search for significant causes; we have decided before the inquiry begins which category of determinants is to provide our explanation. I believe we are not alone, among those who study human phenomena, in tending to prejudge the issues we set out to investigate. Can there be any justification for such a procedure? It is necessary at this point to say something about the phenomena or 'things' we attempt to relate, and about the nature of our understanding or explanation. The phenomena we apprehend in the world around us can be classified in various ways, but in particular into organic and inorganic. Our scientific understanding of both types depends on laying bare the relations of each whole with its parts, and of each whole with other wholes (including causal relations). In the case of inorganic things these relationships are describable in physico-chemical terms. Organic things, however, are more difficult. Many of the terms forming part of their description cannot be reduced to the language of physics and chemistry. Among biologists there is no complete agreement whether this impossibility is of the nature of things or due merely to our present ignorance. Thus while organic phenomena may also, within certain (constantly changing) limits, be described in physico-chemical terms, to an important extent</page><page sequence="6">20 UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY their description requires the use of terms which represent a distinct biological level of interpretation. Man is, of course, an organic phenomenon, but in his case still further com- plications arise through his possession of mind with powers which, in some respects, seem unique. An organism such as man, exhibiting motivated be- haviour, abstract thinking and planning, may be described at several levels of interpretation above and beyond the physico-chemical or even the biological. For instance few would assert that there is an immediate likelihood of moral or aesthetic judgments being reducible to physico-chemical terms. In geomorphology or climatology explanation and understanding (the exposition of the internal and external relations of the phenomena involved) are attained at the physico-chemical level of interpretation. Can we say at what level we should work when considering the phenomena studied in human geography? Or can we assume, as we must if we adopt the environmental thesis in our procedure, that the physico-chemical level of interpretation is the most significant or fundamental? What are the phenomena involved? We are in this respect very catholic in our taste. But even without seeking to determine exactly the range of relevant topics it must be abundantly clear that the majority of the human phenomena considered in political, social and economic geography are in one very important sense different from those of geomorphology or climatology. For in those human phenomena the mind and will of man, acting perhaps instinctively, perhaps guided by acquired reaction, perhaps purposively (adopting means to reach his goal), are in some way or other vitally concerned in the series of events constituting or antecedent to such phenomena. They can scarcely, that is to say, be reduced to or understood in purely physico-chemical terms. This inadequacy of a physical approach to human geography (as postulated in the environmentalist doctrine) is further illustrated by other characteristics of human behaviour. The human reaction to external stimulus (from the physical background), because it must pass through the mind, is determined not only by the nature of the external stimulus but also by the nature of the mind through which it passes. Thus great complications arise through the operation of memory, by means of which events which have occurred in the past (and no longer exist) can affect an existing series of events. Furthermore every person's perceptions involve both a subjective and an objective com- ponent. The objective component belongs to the physical stimulus which leads to the perception. But pure perception is also intimately associated with personal concepts, and in some respects each man's appraisal of an identical object is peculiarly his own. Thus an African with no experience of the world outside his native forest, transported by magic carpet to one of our own houses, would perceive what we also perceive, a prevailingly red object of a certain shape. But because his previous experience vastly differs from ours it is impos- sible he should perceive it as a house. Yet in physico-chemical terms the house is the same whoever looks at it. In our two perceptions there is something in</page><page sequence="7">UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY 21 common, the objective element, and something different, the subjective element. Human geographers, and others who study phenomena embracing human action and its results, are up against complications due to the fact that the reaction of man to a given physical background is apt to be strongly coloured by this subjective element in his apprehension of that background. The way we have shaped or been shaped in the past influences the reactions of the present. One seems to be stressing the obvious, yet do not many geographical procedures involve illegitimate short cuts in the relational chains of events? Do we not tend to reduce man to the level of inanimate nature? Most of us have probably welcomed a way of escape from the difficulties occasioned by the environmentalist thesis in the famous dictum of Professor L. Febvre, 'there are no necessities, but everywhere possibilities; and man, as master of the possibilities, is the judge of their use'.5 Here, at least, was offered a new position from which the battle could be fought. The denial of necessity coupled with the acceptance of environmental control seemed exactly to fit our needs and to get over the awkward fact that the environmental doctrine 'is supported by impressions of common experience regarding matters not so easily accounted for in any other way'." But what do we mean by 'possibilities'? The term is ambiguous. In any given situation the possibilities of human action are always, in a certain sense, limited by the physical environment. In another sense, however, they are a function of human knowledge and enterprise. What is possible for one man is impossible for another. When men choose a course of action they are choosing from among what, relative to their own mental and material equipment, seem possible courses. What is conceived to be possible may of course turn out to be impossible, and vice versa. Possibilities thus can be stated either at a level where mental processes are involved or at lower levels of biological or physico-chemical interpretation, ignoring man's knowledge and capabilities. [The very word 'possibilities' therefore by its ambiguity evades the issue before us and its seeming solution of the difficulty is an illusion. If by possi- bilities we mean the purely physical possibilities, then in fact there is little difference between Febvre's possibilism and the environmental hypothesis we have been examining. If by possibilities we mean the physical-and-human possibilities, then in attempting to understand them we can equally have no ground for assuming, as we do, that the physical part of the explanation is any more significant than the non-physical.] Let me re-emphasize the fact that when we speak of men reacting to environment we are speaking very vaguely, and that the same human reaction may have explanations at more than one level. Men react, in one sense, when actinic rays darken their skins. They also react, but in another sense, when, realizing that the sun is warm and strong, they choose to sunbathe. The first 5 A Geographical Introduction to Histolry (1925), 236. The words are often attributed to Vidal de la Blache. 6 R. S. PLATT, 'Environmentalism v. Geography', American Journal of Sociology, 53 (1948), 351.</page><page sequence="8">22 UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR ARGUMENTS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY reaction may be understood in biological, or perhaps even physico-chemical, terms; the second only at a supra-biological level, since it involves motivated action and value judgments. Two kinds of explanation or understanding are relevant to the same event, and, though there is a widespread prejudice that the really fundamental explanation is in physico-chemical terms, I am not prepared to argue that in our present state of knowledge one kind is necessarily more important than the other. But I do wish to stress their distinctness and to emphasize the difficulty of achieving a synthesis which will encompass or transcend these different levels. I believe that we find ourselves at a particularly fluid phase in the develop- ment of the specialized disciplines which study human societies. Old labels tend to be attached to new contents. Many historians are widening the scope of their subject, and one notices that, at least in schools and training colleges, the so-called social studies are here and there swallowing up geography. We may feel some concern because our vested interests seem to be challenged, and think that some of the work done under that general label seems to us somewhat trivial. Yet let us make no mistake; there is ample evidence that those social studies are attracting first-class minds. What is more, when ordinary men and women are anxiously wondering what can be done to right a topsy-turvy world society, the popular appeal of social studies is likely to grow. I hope we shall not approach this situation from the point of view of political expediency, but shall strive towards the highest academic ideals. It may be faith rather than reason which prompts me, but I believe that, taking the long view, survival comes to those who produce the most significant results. Can one honestly claim that in the field of what it is now fashionable to call social geography we are making real headway? I think not. One main reason, I suggest, is the continued widespread assumption that physical geography is for us the necessary basis for understanding the human phenomena in question. This is no attack on geomorphology or climatology as such. Indeed one envies their conclusive results and the logical methods by which they are reached. Nor does one wish to say that the social geographer is not the better for studying them. But insofar as we human geographers feel that the first step in the understanding of the human phenomena of an area is to analyse it in physical terms, and then think of those physical conditions as the principal determinants, the result will be patches and shreds, for we shall debar ourselves in the majority of cases from attaining a true understanding. May we not admit that at supra- biological levels of interpretation men react to external things not in terms alone of the objective characteristics of these things, which are to be understood in physico-chemical terms, but also according to the ideas they have in their minds concerning these external things? The surer, though more difficult, basis for studying the phenomena of social geography is to know something of the men and the furniture of their minds. I do fear that with our present methods, because of the unquestioning assumption of a certain routine procedure, we are failing in human geography to make the kind of progress which spells survival.</page></plain_text>
