<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dome of the Mind: Monticello in Weimar Susan Bernstein At the opening of Poe's story, "The Fall of the House of Usher," the narrator encounters a lugubrious double of Roderick Usher in the form of his house. The "vacant and eye-like windows" are remarked upon twice; the parallel is reinforced by the connection between the "minute fungi" growing in a "web-work" across the eaves and Roderick's "web-like" hair, grown "all unheeded," and even between the "moulded chin" and the moldy bricks. The mutual interp?n?tra? tion of spirit and matter in Poe's prose drags spirit into the tarn of signifying matter, confines the loftiness of reason in w7hat eventually appears, in Roderick's painting, as a sealed underground vault. The passage between body and mind in the figure of the house allows the commingling of the inorganic and the organic, of death and life. If the body is the temple of the spirit, it is also its casket and dungeon. The dome of the mind becomes the skull of the brain. The figure of the dome of the mind was suggested to me by a visit to the Rotunda at the University of Virginia.1 This lofty dome, built in reminiscence of the Pantheon in Rome, originally housed the library and was the place where examinations were held. Thomas Jefferson, the self-proclaimed "father" of the University, an epithet he ordered to be inscribed on his tombstone, positioned the Rotunda at the "head" of the Lawn, the rectangular green structuring the original campus. Jefferson envisioned the Rotunda as a "temple of knowledge," a secular structure replacing the more traditional chapel.2 The white dome billows up, suggestive of a translucent forehead or a project? ing pate.

The figure of the dome points upward towards the sublime transcendence of this world in the vaults of the cathedral, but it also points to the adherence of mind and matter in the head or the brain. The skull stands as the memorial of this meeting place: the dome turned inwards. The location of the self or the mind in the head or brain is conso? nant with the translucence of the symbol and the reversibility of inside and outside common in the eighteenth century. At the same time, the isomorphism between self and body reaches back to the Biblical suggestions that the body is the temple of the spirit.3 Architecture and physiognomy cooperate to house the spirit. Vitruvius formalizes the parallel between building and the human body in the concept of symmetry: "Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard. Thus in the human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony between forearm, foot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is with perfect buildings."4 The organic symmetry of the body serves as the model for building symmetry. Palladio, too, postulated a homology between the body and the house: "The handsomeness will arise from a fair form, and the correspondence between the Whole and its Parts, of the Parts among themselves, and of them to the Whole: because of that a Building ought to appear an entire and perfect Body."5 The harmony of parts and whole attributed to the body reiterates a harmonic correspondence between the body and the building. At the same time, the body encloses and entraps the spirit. The various forms of knowledge, writes Sir Philip Sidney, "by the Greeks called architectonike. . . draw us to as high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clayey lodgings, can be capable of... to lift up the mind from the dungeon of the body . . . ."6 There is thus a strange complicity between the ideals of Classicism and the entrapment in flesh that takes on a more Gothic hue. Poe's story, of course, is driven by the collapse of difference culminating in the collapse of the titular house into its reflection in the tarn. The house had passed in direct descent from father to son, allowing the fusion of the "patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the 'House of Usher'?an appel? lation which seemed to include . . . both the family and the family</page><page sequence="3">MLN 983 mansion."7 Poe echoes Horace Walpole's Castle of Otranto, in which a similar confusion between name and house takes place. In this novel, the rule of property has been overthrown by Manfred's illegitimate sei? zure of the Castle. The strange interaction between the dismembered parts of the giant and the final emergence of the image of Alphonso seeks to repair the mismatch between body and house foretold by the initial prophecy: "That the castle and lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it."8 Emanuel Swedenborg's theory of correspondence shows a certain affinity with the logic of the Gothic. The "inflow" of spiritual things into bodies makes them into representations that not only "represent" but also "respond" to their spiritual origins. Just as the "true owner" of the Castle of Otranto emerges as a vision of a giant, the human body, for Swedenborg, corresponds to a "giant" heavenly body: . . . everything in the human body has a correspondence with something in heaven. This holds true to the point that there is not the smallest particle in the body that does not have something spiritual and heavenly corresponding to it, or?which is the same?that does not have a corresponding heavenly community. For these communities exist according to all the categories and subcategories of spiritual and heavenly realities. Indeed, they all exist in a design such that they reflect, taken all together, a single person?this in all details, both inwardly and outwardly. This is why heaven in its entirety is called the Universal Human (Maximus Homo) ... In contrast, the people who are in hell are outside that Universal Human, and have a correspon? dence with waste products and disorders.9 The figuration of the identity of inside and outside, container and contained, on the model of the body implies and reproduces its own excess.10 Lavater's physiognomy, too, is constructed around a thor? oughgoing correspondence between interior and exterior: Der Mensch hat das mit allen Dingen in der Welt gemein, da? gewisse Seiten, gewisse Theile an ihm zum Vorschein kommen, gewisse nicht . . . Er besteht aus Oberfl?che und Innhalt. Etwas an ihm ist ?u?erlich, und etwas innerlich. Die? Aeu?erliche und Innere stehen offenbar in einem genauen unmittelbaren Zusammenhange ... Es ist also ein wesentliches Verh?ltni? zwischen seiner Au?enseite und seinem Innwendigen.11 Man has in common with all things in the world that certain sides, certain parts of him appear prominently, and some not. . . He consists of a surface and a content. Something of him is outer, something inner. This outer and inner clearly stand in an exact immediate connection . . . Thus there is an essential relationship between his external side and his inward side.</page><page sequence="4">984 SUSAN BERNSTEIN Physiognomy of course consists in reading the connections between what appears and what is hidden to reveal the complete correspon? dence of the two. As for Swedenborg, certain meanings are connected to certain parts of the body; in particular, as for Lavater, the ability to think is located in the head (127). The figuring of the body as a harmonious container for the spirit it houses partakes in what Paul de Man has called "aesthetic ideology," which he explores especially in his book of that title. The logic of aesthetic ideology picks up material and integrates it into a conceptual whole.12 In de Man's terms, aesthetic ideology reconfigures materiality as phenomenality, that is, as the material appearance or manifestation of the intelligible, of which it then stands as a synechdochal signifier. His late work on aesthetic ideology could be understood as an effort to dislodge a space for what he calls "materiality," that is, a materiality that would not be subject to appropriation and synthesis and in fact would stand beyond any relation to understanding at all. As Marc Redfield argues in Phantom Formations, this model of aesthetic ideology is crucial in the logic of Bildung in the age of Goethe.13 The logic of aesthetic ideology supports the interest in the skull that Goethe expresses in his late poem listed in the Hamburger Ausgabe as "Schillers Reliquien." Originally placed in a mass grave in the Kas? sengew?lbe in the Jakobskirche cemetary in Weimar, Schiller's remains were disinterred in 1826 to be moved to a more respectable site in the F?rstengruft The mayor of Weimar determined that the largest of the many skulls belonged to the great national poet. The skull was given to Goethe, who kept it at home to contemplate for a few days before it was placed in the ducal vault.14 Goethe's poem traces out the double-valence of the skull, which Walter Benjamin describes as the alternation between symbol and allegory in Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels: W?hrend im Symbol mit der Verkl?rung des Unterganges das transfigurierte Antlizt der Natur im Lichte der Erl?sung fl?chtig sich offenbart, liegt in der Allegorie die faci?s hippocratica der Geschichte als erstarrte Urlandschaft dem Betrachter vor Augen. Die Geschichte in allem was sie Unzeitiges, Leidvolles, Verfehltes von Beginn an hat, pr?gt sich in einem Antlitz?nein in einem Totenkopf aus.15 Whereas in the symbol destruction is idealized and the transfigured face of nature is fleetingly revealed in the light of redemption, in allegory the observer is confronted with the facies hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape. Everything about history that, from the very begin</page><page sequence="5">MLN 985 ning, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccessful, is expressed in a face?or rather in a death's head.16 Goethe's poem dramatizes the oscillation between what de Man calls materiality and phenomenality in his essay on Kant.17 The poem begins with a trip to the bone-house; the narrator gazes on the horrifying bones, the remnants of life: "Und niemand kann die d?rre Schale lieben, / Welch herrlich edlen Kern sie auch bewahrte" ("And none cares now for husks that have gone dry / Though glorious kernels they did once contain") ,18 The sheer materiality of the empty vessel is trans? figured, though, into script and becomes legible to the narrator: Doch mir Adepten war die Schrift geschrieben Die heil'gen Sinn nicht jedem offenbarte, Als ich inmitten solcher starren Menge Unsch?tzbar herrlich ein Gebild gewahrte . . . (366, 11. 15-18) Yet here was written what my adept's eye, Though few would guess its sacred sense, read plain: Amid the rigid throng one shape I saw Of rare nobility . . . (257-59) The spectacle of the skull allegorizes the turn out of matter into the fresh air of spirit and also dramatizes the exchange between matter and mind: Was kann der Mensch im Leben mehr gewinnen, Als da? sich Gott-Natur ihm offenbare? Wie sie das Feste l??t zu Geist verrinnen, Wie sie das Geisterzeugte fest bewahre. (367, 11. 31-34) To what more noble end our life we use Thank knowing God-and-Nature, which are one? Firm matter melts which She as Mind renews And She makes firm what fertile Mind has done. (259) This trafficking between spirit and "das Feste" characterizes as well the passage from exterior to interior that makes Bildung possible. In Wilhelm Meister, education and elevation occur through the sublima? tion of material surroundings and containers. Wilhelm 's experience</page><page sequence="6">986 SUSAN BERNSTEIN of the "Saal der Vergangenheit," for example, enacts the spiritual ization of matter. As Wilhelm passes into the room, the portents of death communicated by the sphinxes and the Egyptian d?cor are dissolved, "aufgel?st," and thoughts of death are replaced by those of art and life. Time is suspended, and what might be called a free play of the imagination is set into motion. This is expressed in terms of architectonic relations: Die architektonischen Glieder waren mit dem sch?nen gelben Marmor . . . bekleidet, hellblaue Streifen von einer gl?cklichen chemischen Komposition ahmten den Lasurstein nach und gaben, indem sie gleichsam in einem Gegensatz das Auge befriedigten, dem Ganzen Einheit und Verbindung. Alle diese Pracht und Zierde stellte sich in reinen architecktonischen Ver? h?ltnissen dar, und so schien jeder, der hineintrat, ?ber sich selbst erhoben zu sein, indem er durch die zusammentreffende Kunst erst erfuhr, was der Mensch sei und was er sein k?nne.19 The architectonic elements were fashioned from fine yellow marble . . . blue stripes of an ingenious chemical composition reproduced the effect of lapis lazuli, and, pleasing the eye by the contrast, gave coherence and unity to the whole. All this splendor and decoration was achieved by purely architectonic means, and everyone who entered felt uplifted by the design of the whole, showing what man is and what he can be.20 The language here continues to point to the chemical composition that makes possible the sublime experience that goes beyond the mate? rial. The room manifests the balance and harmony between parts and whole, structure and detail, that is typical of a classicizing aesthetic, lifting the subject up to anticipate, but not yet attain, some other status. The description of the room continues: "Es w7ar eine Welt, es war ein Himmel, der den Beschauenden an dieser St?tte umgab, und au?er den Gedanken, welche jene gebildete Gestalten erregten, au?er den Empfindungen, welche sie einfl??ten, schien noch etwas Andres gegenw?rtig zu sein, wovon der ganze Mensch sich angegriffen f?hlte" (7: 541). ("A whole world, a very heaven, surrounded the observer in this place, and aside from the thoughts and feelings aroused by these images, something else seemed to be there that gripped the whole man") (332, translation modified). This being-attacked or gripped that precedes a concept or repre? sentation might present an experience that is a sort of pre-condition for impression, learning or Bildung, in which the boundary between interior and exterior is suspended. The room and its physics present the possibility of their own transcendence. Wilhelm expresses this in a series of questions and exclamations:</page><page sequence="7">MLN 987 "Was ist das," rief er aus, "das, unabh?ngig von aller Bedeutung, frei von allem Mitgef?hl, das uns menschliche Begebenheiten und Schicksale einfl??en, so stark und zugleich so anmutig auf mich zu wirken vermag? Es spricht aus dem Ganzen, es spricht aus jedem Teile mich an, ohne da? ich jenes begreifen, ohne da? ich diese mir besonders zueignen k?nnte! Welchen Zauber ahn' ich in diesen Fl?chen, diesen Linien, diesen H?hen und Breiten, diesen Massen und Farben! Was ist es, das diese Figuren, auch nur obenhin betrachtet, schon als Zierat so erfreulich macht? Ja, ich f?hle, man k?nnte hier verweilen, ruhen, alles mit den Augen fassen, sich gl?cklich finden und ganz etwas andres f?hlen und denken als das, was vor Augen steht." (7: 542) "What is it," he cried, "that, apart from all meaning, aside from the sym? pathetic interest that all human events and fortunes evoke in us, what is it that affects me so strongly and at the same time so pleasantly? It speaks to me from the whole without my comprehending the whole, and from each of the parts without my being able to relate these especially to myself! What is the magic that for me pervades these surfaces, lines, height and breadth, masses and colors? What is it that makes these shapes, even though only decoration, so appealing? That one could remain here, reflect on all one sees, be happy, and yet feel and think things quite different from what stands before one's eyes." (332, translation modified) The suspended syntax of these ejaculations opens a space for "some? thing other," some concept not yet articulated, some understanding not yet acquired. It opens the space for, but does not put in place, the security of representation that allows the experience of the sublime. Yes, one could feel something different?the sublime?or?not. Poe's "Usher" makes explicit this other possibility: that the vacancy prepar? ing for the sublime will in fact not be filled: "I know not how it was," writes the narrator of "The Fall of the House of Usher," ?but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me . . . There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart?an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it [echoing Wilhelm here]?I paused to think?what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. (231)</page><page sequence="8">988 SUSAN BERNSTEIN In the architectonic suspension that allows passage between mind and matter, the classical and gothic/romantic tendencies are profoundly confused. The passages from Goethe and Poe play out the two sides of the skull reflected in Benjamin's analysis of the emblem. Wilhelm 's experience, it appears, is destined to go beyond the walls of the room to see the meaning of man. But the experience of Poe's narrator is explicitly unredeemed, its pauses unfilled, its opening onto the sublime an "ought" that fails and remains an empty "aught." In his famous review of "Goethes Meister," Friedrich Schlegel picks up on Goethe's architectonic language to characterize the suspended relay between whole and parts, structure and ornament. In the suspen? sion of conceptualization, Wilhelm describes his experience in terms of sense or aesthetic perceptions: "Massen" and "Fl?chen," "Linien" and "Farben." Schlegel frequently describes Goethe's novel in terms of painting, pointing often to the figures as "Massen" that form con? stellations and shapes and then dissolve again. He sees the novel as a kind of painterly panorama: Als vorbereitender Teil des ganzen Werks ist das erst Buch eine Reihe von ver?nderten Stellungen und malerischen Gegens?tzen, in deren jedem Wilhelms Charakter von einer andern merkw?rdigen Seite, in einem neuen, helleren Lichte gezeigt wird; und die kleineren, deutlich geschie? denen Massen und Kapitel bilden mehr oder weniger jede f?r sich ein malerisches Ganzes.21 Introductory to the whole work, the first book is a series of varied situa? tions and picturesque [malerisch, painterly] contrasts, each casting a new and brighter light on Wilhelm 's character from a different, noteworthy perspective; and each of the smaller, clearly distinct chapters and blocks [Massen] of narrative forms in itself more or less a picturesque [malerisch] whole.22 Characters, writes Schlegel, are drawoi with a "light hand" and a "ten? der brush" to make them part of a most noble portraiture ("?ber Goethes Meister" 270; "On Goethe's Meister" 278). The uncle adds a third dimension to the tableaux of the narrative, hulking behind the appearing masses. Just as his house contains and displays the reunited and supplemented art collection from Wrilhelm's youth, the uncle himself is figured as a Classical building: Der Onkel n?mlich ruht im Hintergrunde dieses Gem?ldes wie ein gewal? tiges Geb?ude der Lebenskunst im gro?en alten Stil, von edlen einfachen Verh?ltnissen, aus dem reinsten gediegensten Marmor . . . Aber mit m?nn? licher Kraft hat er sich die umgebende Natur zu einer klassischen Welt</page><page sequence="9">MLN 989 gebildet, die sich um seinen selbst?ndigen Geist wie um den Mittelpunkt bewegt. (274, emphasis mine) For the uncle is present in the background of this painting, like a mighty building in the grand old style, devoted to the art of living, with propor? tions of noble simplicity, in the purest, finest marble . . . But with virile energy he shaped the natural world around him into a classical world which circled about his independent spirit as if he were its centre. (282-83, translation modified) The Classical building proliferates itself. The harmonious interplay of its internal relations communicates and reproduces itself. It is thus the model in the mimetic system of Bildung, in the same way, the uncle, Schlegel points out, was an autodidact with no Lehrjahre of his own and therefore no story to tell or confessions to record; but he has laid himself down in the great house, the reasoned organization of the art collection, and the structured temporal totality of the room of the past. The architectural building is qualified, through architectonic, to continue to construct others in its own image. This is precisely the quality the dilettante lacks, according to that fragment: "Was dem Dilettanten eigentlich abgeht, ist Architectonik im h?chsten Sinne, diejenige aus?bende Kraft, welche erschafft, bildet, constituirt. Er hat davon nur eine Art von Ahndung, giebt sich aber durchaus dem Stoff dahin, anstatt ihn zu beherrschen." ("What the dilettante really lacks is architectonic in the highest sense: the practical power that creates, forms, constitutes. He has only a vague intimation of it and abandons himself fully to the material instead of mastering it.")23 Though the uncle as classical temple seems to be an image of per? fection, he steps back and recesses into the two-dimensionality that he seemed to interrupt. While Schlegel considers the uncle, the Abb?, and Lothario to be a kind of trinity-like incarnation of "the genius of the book itself," he nevertheless gives Lothario a certain privilege, again articulated architecturally: "Lothario ist ein gro?er Mensch; der Oheim hat noch etwas Schwerf?lliges, Breites, der Abb? etwas Magres, aber Lothario ist vollendet, seine Erscheinung ist einfach, sein Geist ist immer im Fortschreiten ... Er ist die himmelanstrebende Kuppel, jene sind die gewaltigen Pilaster, auf denen sie ruht. Diese architek? tonischen Naturen umfassen, tragen und erhalten das Ganze" (278) ("Lothario is a great man. There is something heavy and sprawling about the Uncle, something meagre about the Abb?, but Lothario is entire. His appearance is simple, his mind is constantly moving for? ward . . . He is the dome rising to heaven, they are the mighty pillars</page><page sequence="10">990 SUSAN BERNSTEIN on which it rests. These architectonic natures encompass, bear and support the whole") (285). The completion of the classical rectangle is pierced by the cupola. The cupola or dome was developed by Roman builders in the first century CE and is often described as a "brilliant addition" or "cap," an exuberant supplement, to the classical rectangle. A cupola is a dome, but it is also a smaller version designed as a lookout. It comes from the Latin word cupa, a cup, a casque, or a barrel. Dome, of course, comes from the Latin word, domus, for house. The Pantheon, built in its pres? ent form around 125 CE, became the archetypal vaulted dome.24 In German, there is the further complication of the word Gew?lbe, mean? ing arch, vault, curved structure, or dome. Schlegel writes in his review of Wilhelm Meister that the uncle is a classical building who functions as a model, perhaps providing the rules of proportion that allow new classical forms to be created around him. While at first this image of symmetrical balance seems to be perfect and complete, Lothario is actually the one who perfects the building by exceeding its structure and opening its roof. Schlegel reframes his take on the novel, taking up an architectonic perspective that allows the three verbs (and the three characters) to be intertwined: containing, bearing, and holding up or maintaining [umfassen, tragen und erhalten]. Schlegel's critical perspective takes up the stance of the one who enters the room of the past. Recall the moment of entering the room of the past in Wilhelm Meister. "Alle diese Pracht und Zierde stellte sich in reinen architeck tonischen Verh?ltnissen dar, und so schien jeder, der hineintrat, ?ber sich selbst erhoben zu sein, indem er durch die zusammentreffende Kunst erst erfuhr, was der Mensch sei und was er sein k?nne" (7: 540). The perception of the architectonic behind the architecture rounds off the aesthetic play of relations; in the experience of the sublime, the viewer exceeds himself and extends into an empty space allowing for a larger conception of "man" and his possibilities. In "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," de Man quotes an inter? esting passage from Kant's Critique of Judgment which focuses on the relation between the architecture of the vault and the architectonic of the sublime. In this passage, Kant distinguishes between an aesthetic judgment of the sublime from one based on concepts: Wenn man also den Anblick des bestirnten Himmels erhaben nennt, so mu? man der Beurteilung desselben nicht Begriffe von Welten, von vern?nftigen Wesen bewohnt, und nun die Hellen Punkte, womit wir den Raum ?ber uns erf?llt sehen, als ihre Sonnen, in sehr zweckm??ig f?r sie</page><page sequence="11">MLN 991 gestellten Kreisen bewegt, zum Grunde legen, sondern blo?, wie man ihn sieht, als ein weites Gew?lbe, was alles befa?t.2^ If then we call the sight of the starry heaven sublime, we must not place at the basis of our judgment concepts of worlds inhabited by rational beings, and regard the bright points, with which we see the space above us filled, as their suns moving in circles purposively fixed with reference to them; be we must regard it, just as we see it, as a distant, all-embracing vault.26 De Man suggests that this passage converges with an aesthetic tradition, which he traces through Wordsworth and connects with Heidegger, that understands the architectonic as the frame for poetic grounded ness or dwelling:27 The predominant perception, in the Kant passage, is that of the heavens and the ocean as an architectonic construct. The heavens are a vault that covers the totality of earthy space as a roof covers a house. Space ... is a house in which we dwell more or less safely, or more or less poetically, on this earth. This is also how the sea is perceived or how, according to Kant, poets perceive it: its horizontal expanse is like a floor bounded by the horizon, by the wTalls of heaven as they close off and delimit the building. (81) De Man argues that the vault is the emergence of a materiality that exceeds and defies the destiny of phenomenality to be included in a totalizing concept or design. Kant differentiates the perception of the heaven as a vault from the conceptual teleology7 that sees stars and planets through the mediation of the concept of purposiveness.28 The sense of comforting enclosure, according to de Man, is an architectonic construct that stabilizes a world: "... the sky is originally conceived as a roof or vault that shelters us, by anchoring us in the world, standing on a horizontal plane, under the sky, reassuringly stabilized by the weight of our own gravity" (81). This corresponds well with Heidegger's understanding of dwelling, wohnen, as a measured positionality gathering together the elements of "the fourfold": "auf der Erde," "unter dem Himmel," "vor den G?ttlichen," and "das Miteinander der Menschen" ("on the earth," "under the sky," "remaining before the divinities," "men's being with one another").29 Picking up on Kant's suggestion that one must see the components of these scenes apart from their function, "wie die Dichter es tun, nach dem, was der Augenschien zeigt," (cited in de Man 80) de Man quotes Wordsworth both to position and to dismantle the architectonic of Heidegger's four: "'The sky was not a sky / Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds!'"80 The dissolution of</page><page sequence="12">992 SUSAN BERNSTEIN the sky from the earth, the breaking of their relation, allows the sky to appear as a sheer "mass" or space, like the "Massen" and "Fl?chen" Schlegel sees in Goethe's Meister, or like the color and chemical masses that compose and protrude in the room of the past. The loosening of these "masses" from any organizing intuition or structure, exemplified for de Man in Wordsworth's severing of sky from earth, enacts the "poetic vision" of mere "Augenschein." This brings about a sense of disorientation. De Man describes: "But, if the sky suddenly separated from the earth and is no longer, in Words? worth's terms, a sky of earth, we lose all feeling of stability and start to fall, so to speak, skyward . . ." (81). This falling skyward is induced by the cascading upward movement through a set of substitutions from roof to dome/vault to sky to heaven.31 The enclosing dome cannot contain, for it originally has a hole in the head: the oculus in the Pantheon, of course, through which rain falls. The Pantheon is a partially open-air structure, a pagan monument that does not enclose or shelter. Its world is neither the lively stones of Heidegger's earth nor the joined multitudes of Hegel's independent architecture. Instead, like the dead uncle, it has spawned a thousand state-houses and basilicas in its own image without having any story of its own to tell. No mind: Pantheon. Suzanne Doppelt, stars fixed like nails in the vault. (Images used by permission of the artist.)</page><page sequence="13">MLN 993 The intrusion of the historical Pantheon in its stony singularity here parallels the moment of "sheer materiality" that de Man locates in the figure of the sky. De Man wants to see in Kant's heaven the sheer inappropriable materiality that he associates with the architectonic. The essay's title, "Phenomenality and Materiality," points out the two prongs of de Man's reading. The understanding of building as phenomenon integrates it into the totalizing aesthetic of the symbol while the identification of materiality points to an element that can? not be led into any spiritual itinerary. Finally, though, as long as this materiality is identified with building?and not just in general but with the specific form of the vaulted dome?the association with the literal, and hence a set of substitutions between literal and figurai terms, cannot be avoided. De Man himself points to the problematic figures of speech linking buildings and heaven: "No mind is involved in the Kantian vision of ocean and heaven. To the extent that any mind, that any judgment, intervenes, it is in error?for it is not the case that heaven is a vault or that the horizon bounds the ocean like the walls of a building" (82).32 If this remark parallels de Man's version of Wordsworth's "sky not of earth," it, too, remains linked to the empirical stone from w7hich it dissociates itself. But what kind of a building could be wholly independent from it? In the interest of excavating a mostly unseen possibility of Kant's architectonic as a critique of the logic of embodiment, de Man asserts the priority of Kant's building over any trope or image: "Kant's architectonic world is not a metamorphosis of a fluid world into the solidity of stone, nor is his building a trope or a symbol that substitutes for the actual entities. Heaven and ocean as building are a priori, previous to any understanding, to any exchange or anthropomorphism" (82). If we look again at the passage in Kant, the heavenly vault finally does maintain its function to enclose, just as Wordsworth's sky remains linked to the earth which it momentarily denies. When we say the starry heaven is sublime, Kant says, we base the judgment on "poetic percep? tion," "blo?, wie man ihn sieht, als ein weites Gew?lbe, was alles befa?t" (196) ("just as one sees it, as a vast vault encompassing everything").33 The phrase, "blo?, wie man ihn sieht," does point to an instance of simple no mind, Augenschein. But the addition of the modifying vault re-cognizes the bare vision of no mind. The final clause, "was alles befa?t," small as it is, reinstalls the containing and enclosing function of the vault, which totalizes and supports, provides shelter for dwell? ing, and extends its own materiality to encompass the heavens beyond itself. In the same way, Lothario as "Kuppel" is an empty supplement</page><page sequence="14">994 SUSAN BERNSTEIN that tops off the already complete edifice it crowns. The containing function of the dome performs a synthesis between the materiality of the building, i.e. the dome, on the one hand, and the heaven to which it is transferred on the other. The phrase, "ein weites Gew?lbe, was alles befa?t," involves a metaphoric extension of the built to the unbuilt or what lies beyond the built and thus reconnects heaven to earth.34 The enclosure of heaven in architecture creates the imma? nent transcendence of myth. This is why Walter Benjamin invokes the same vocabulary to describe the mythic character of Goethe as author. Benjamin locates the mythic dimension of Die Wahlverwandtschaften, in this instance, precisely in the Technik ofThe novel, a Technikwhose goal it is to keep its own secret. Through the enclosure of the vault, the transcendent sky is encrypted: "So steht Goethe im Alter aller Kritik gegen?ber: als Olympier. . . . Dieses Wort . . . bezeichnet die dunkle, in sich selbst versunkene, mythische Natur, die in sprachloser Starre dem Goetheschen K?nstlertum innewrohnt. Als Olympier hat er den Grundbau des Werkes gelegt und mit kargen Wrorten das Gew?lbe geschlossen" (GS 1.1: 147). ("This is how Goethe in old age stands vis-?-vis all criticism: as olympian. . . . This expression . . . character? izes the dark, deeply self-absorbed, mythic nature that, in speechless rigidity, indwells Goethian artistry. As olympian he laid the foundation of the work and with scant words rounded out the dome.")35 The sealing off of the secret creates a crypt, the obverse space of the sublime dome. For Hegel, the enclosure of the pyramid-tomb creates and delineates the space of interiority in distinction from its inorganic exterior.33 He describes: "So ist es denn auch in der Baukunst von Wichtigkeit, da? hier die Abtrennung gleichsam des Geistigen als der inneren Bedeutung erfolgt, die f?r sich zur Darstellung gebracht wird, w?hrend die leibliche H?lle als blo? architektonische Umschlie?ung unhergestellt ist"37 ("Thus after all it is of importance for architecture that here there ensues the separation out, as it were, of the spiritual as the inner meaning which is portrayed on its own account, while the corporeal shell is placed round it as a purely architectural enclo? sure") .38 The subject becomes the central point of interest, "der f?r sich selbst bedeutend erscheint und sich selber ausdr?ckt, unterschieden von seiner Behausung, die somit als blo? dienende H?lle konstruiert wird" (II: 292) ("an objective individual who appears significant on his own account and expresses himself in distinction from his habita? tion which thus is constructed as a purely serviceable shell") (II: 651). The separation of the mind from the body parallels the emergence of the function of architecture to serve as a container and to repeat</page><page sequence="15">MLN 995 the division of inside and outside performed on the body of the deceased. The independent indifference of the container signals the fact that it has not been fully penetrated by spirit, that it exceeds the expression or representational function that would make it legible as Schiller's skull becomes legible for Goethe. The excess exteriority of a materiality not yet penetrated by spirit of course constitutes the sublime for Hegel, which he attributes to the symbol: Wo das Symbol sich dagegen in seiner eigent?mlichen Form selbst?ndig ausbildet, hat es im allgemeinen den Charakter der Erhabenheit, weil zun?chst ?berhaupt nur die in sich noch ma?lose und nicht frei in sich bestimmte Idee zur Gestalt werden soll und deshalb in den konkreten Erscheinungen keine bestimmte Form zu finden imstande ist, welche vollst?ndig dieser Abstraktion und Allgemeinheit entspricht. In diesem Nichtentsprechen aber ?berragt die Idee ihr ?u?erliches Dasein, statt darin aufgegangen oder vollkommen beschlossen zu sein. Dies Hinaussein ?ber die Bestimmtheit der Erscheinung macht den allgemeinen Charakter des Erhabenen aus. (I: 393-94) On the other hand, when the symbol is developed independently in its own proper form, it has in general the character of sublimity, because at first, on the wrhole, it is only the Idea which is still measureless, and not freely determined in itself, that is to be given shape, and therefore it cannot find in concrete appearance any specific form corresponding completely with this abstraction and universality. But in this non-correspondence the Idea transcends its external existence instead of having blossomed or been per? fectly enclosed in it. This flight beyond the determinateness of appearance constitutes the general character of the sublime. (I: 303) Hegel's sublime consists, on the one hand, of the enclosure of architec? ture that makes possible a split between the interior and the exterior. At the same time, it creates an excess that cannot be gathered into immediate perception or understood as the meaning of a visible sign or manifestation. The physics and semiotics of the sublime allow it to be both an enclosure and an excess. Roderick's painting in "The Fall of the House of Usher" allows us to understand this contradic? tory structure. What Roderick paints is sheer interiority figured as a subterranean vault: One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend . . . may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceed? ing depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any</page><page sequence="16">996 SUSAN BERNSTEIN portion of its vast extent, and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernable; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor. (237) On the one hand, the painting is taken to be an absolute correspon? dent or expression of Roderick's mind: "If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher" (237). On the other hand, the depiction outstrips language and comprehension. His paintings grew "into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why?from these painting ... I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words" (236-37). For Hegel, this material excess is "monstrous" and alienating: In der Welt der altpersischen, indischen, ?gyptischen Gestalten und Gebilde ist uns deshalb, wenn wir zun?chst hineintreten, nicht recht geheuer; wir f?hlen, da? wir unter Aufgaben wandeln; f?r sich allein sagen uns diese Gebilde nicht zu und vergn?gen und befriedigen nicht nach ihrer unmit? telbaren Anschauung, sondern fordern uns durch sich selber auf, ?ber sie hinaus zu ihrer Bedeutung fortzugehen, welche noch etwas Weiteres, Tieferes als diese Bilder sei. (I: 400) Thus when we first enter the world of the old-Persian, Indian, Egyptian shapes and productions, our footing is not really secure; we feel that we are wandering amongst problems [Aufgaben]', in themselves alone these productions say nothing to us; they do not please us or satisfy by their immediate appearance, but by themselves they encourage us to advance beyond them to their meaning which is something wider and deeper than they are. (I: 308) In Romantic architecture (for Hegel), the emptiness of the vault is projected upward in the figure of the vaulted arch or dome, which opens a space above the rectilinearity of the purposive enclosure typical of Classical architecture (the temple housing the god). The soaring arches, towers, and spires of the Gothic cathedral are supposed to embody the very process of disembodiment that the Romantic subject performs in withdrawing from the Classical body into the mind of spirit: "Die Bewegung, Unterscheidung, Vermittlung des Gem?ts in seiner Erhebung vom Irdischen zum Unendlichen, zum Jenseits und H?heren w?re in dieser leeren Gleichheit eines Vierecks architektonisch nicht ausgedr?ckt" (II: 335) ("The movement of the spirit with the distinctions it makes and its conciliation of them in the course of its elevation from the terrestrial to the infinite, to the loftier beyond, would not be expressed architecturally in this empty</page><page sequence="17">MLN 997 uniformity of a quadrilateral") (II: 688).9'9 In the Romantic (third) moment of architecture, the empty enclosure is reappropriated as the image of the interior, of the mind that has withdrawn from its body. The dome is freed from its purposive form and, like a blister on the brain, swells up above its stony foundation: Betritt man das Innere eines mittelalterlichen Domes, so wird man weni? ger an die Festigkeit und mechanische Zweckm??igkeit tragender Pfeiler und eines darauf ruhenden Gew?lbes als an die W?lbungen eines Waldes erinnert, dessen Baumreihen ihre Zweige zueinander neigen und zusam? menschie?en ... im Gotischen aber steigen die W?nde selbst?ndig und frei empor, ebenso die Pfeiler, die sich dann oben nach mehreren Richtungen auseinanderbreiten.... Es ist, als tr?gen sie nicht. . . . Solches Gew?lbe, das f?r die Innerlichkeit bestimmt ist, dies Schauerliche, das zur Betrachtung einl?dt, stellt der Dom dar, insofern die W?nde und darunter der Wald von Pfeilern frei in der Spitze zusammenkommen. (II: 335-36) Enter the interior of a medieval cathedral, and you are reminded less of the firmness and mechanical appropriateness of load-carrying pillars and a vault resting on them than on the vaultings of a forest where in lines of trees the branches incline to one another and quickly meet. . . . Whereas in Gothic architecture the walls rise upwards freely and independently; so do the pillars, which branch out above apart from one another in several directions. ... It is as if they were not supports at all. . . . The cathedral presents a vault like this, one meant for reverie, this place of dread which invites meditation, because the walls and the forest of pillars meet freely at the apex. (II: 688) With the suspension of the purposiveness of enclosure, the dome-vault appears as a sheer image; as in de Man's description of the Kantian sublime, "no mind is involved," since the vaulted space appears simply as the mirror of the subject's withdrawal from space. Hegel, like Kant, perhaps unwittingly points to what de Man calls a "material vision" that cannot be contained by the structure of the "representation of ideas" in a logic of embodiment. Of course, in the grander scheme of Hegel's aesthetics, this image of vacancy should be read as a kind of manifestation of the relation of spirit to itself. De Man reads the Gew?lbe, in part, as a component of aesthetic ideology: the unifying absorption of material elements in totalizing figures of speech. He attributes the commingling of matter and its other to Wordsworth's sublime, drawing in his own figure of a dome to enclose the surfaces of Wordsworth's imagery. Analyzing a passage from "Tintern Abbey," De Man writes: "The sublimity of the round ocean, horizon-bound as a vast dome, is especially reminiscent of the</page><page sequence="18">998 SUSAN BERNSTEIN Kant passage. But the two invocations of sublime nature soon diverge. Wordsworth's sublime is an instance of the constant exchange between mind and nature, of the chiasmic transfer of properties between the sensory and the intellectual world" (82). The logic of aesthetic incarna? tion that allows elevation also makes possible the descent from spirit into matter. The power of reversal could be observed, for example, in the language surrounding the Berlin Brain, the new7 philological library at the Freie Universit?t, which was selected as an "Ort im Land der Ideen," an initiative mounted by the German government with the cooperation of an advertizing agency in the re-packaging of Germany as the land of the spirit.40 This initiative reinforces the isomorphism between inside and outside as much as the building's nickname. The campaign quite literally materializes spirit, mapping the mental onto the physical in an ideologically and technologically driven geography; the very land is made of ideas. The texts contained in the library are metaphorized or sublimated into the image of "understanding" for which the brain stands. According to a press release from the FU, the library fuses eleven different philological libraries and covers a broad range of things: "Von der Weltliteratur im Zeitalter der Globalisierung ?ber die Bibliothek von Alexandria als Mutter aller wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken bis hin zum Fu?ball in Lateinamerika" ("From world literature in the age of globalization, to the library at Alexandria as the mother of all scientific libraries, to soccer in Latin America").41 The inclusion of the library of Alexandria in the middle of this list suggests an inverse Kuppel, positing the library as the container of the container, the mother of all containers. It is of course the same architect, Norman Foster, who designed the new dome of the Reich? stag. This transparent dome has an inverted shaft, a "central mirrored cone" bringing light into the interior, and thus in a way domesticates even the open oculus of the Pantheon. The Brain as a landmark in the land of ideas and the dome commemorating and reestablishing the German state make room for each other. The transmutability of the logic of embodiment and animation subtends the structure of Bildung as well as the aesthetic ideology7 that allows us to think of Jefferson's Rotunda as the Dome of the Mind. In the "academical village" he founded in Charlottesville, Jef? ferson inseminates stone in a kind of monstrous copulation. While it is tempting to try to connect copulation and Kuppel or cupola, they are in fact unrelated. But Gew?lbe, according to Grimm, translates the Latin word "fornix" arch, vault, brothel, or cellar for prostitution (also the name of part of the brain), or simply fornicatio, fornication,</page><page sequence="19">MLN 999 camera confornicatio, arched room or womb. Thus the dome, or home, becomes the fornication of spirit with body, its enclosure in the crypt, the skull, the casket. Or vice versa: the built transfigures its body into the instructive script of the example or specimen. Schlegel describes Wilhelm Meister as a wonderful Beispielsammlung, each one endowed with the ability to communicate and teach. "Ja, man d?rfte eine systematische Ordnung in dem Vortrage dieser poetischen Physik der Poesie finden; nicht eben das tote Fachwerk eines Lehrgeb?udes, aber die lebendige Stufenleiter jeder Naturge? schichte und Bildungslehre" (265) ("It is possible, indeed, to find a system in the author's presentation of this physics of poetry?not by any means the dead half-timbered framework of a didactic edifice, but stage after stage of every natural history and educational theory in living progression") (274, translation modified). This physics of poetry confounds the distinction between nature and building out of which it springs, retreating from a hollow and dead didactic build? ing to an animated lesson that both delights and instructs. Thomas Jefferson conceived of the University of Virginia, opened in 1825, as a similar edifice of education and history.42 His novel conception of the University as an academical village expanded the traditional single-building model, the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary (which Jefferson attended) to create a space not just for learning but for living, for a kind of "novel." The main quadrangle, the Lawn, like Wilhelm Meister, was envisioned to be a collection of examples. The Lawn is lined on both sides with two rows of single-story student residences punctuated by ten pavilions, the larger two-story buildings designed to house professors and classrooms. "The Pavilions, he explained, were to be 'models of taste and good architecture, &amp; of a variety of appearance, no two alike, so as to serve as specimens for the Architectural lectures'" (Howard quoting Jefferson, 143). The University was to be a world which instructed those who dwelled within it. Howard writes: "Taken together, the Pavilions constitute an open-book examination" (156-57). The figure of the Lawn shadows a kind of Swedenborgian Homo Maximus. The "foot," the south end, was left open to symbolize the possibilities of growth and openness. The Rotunda was placed at the "head" of the Lawn; the space inside the dome housed the University library.43 This was obviously not Jefferson's first dome: the other at Monticello of course has spread itself everywhere on the US nickel. That dome, though, was not quite accessible to the mind. It created a cramped interior space that could be reached only by small and</page><page sequence="20">1000 SUSAN BERNSTEIN inadequate staircases and was used sometimes as a guestroom or not at all. While Goethe built a grand stairway to welcome his guests in Weimar, Jefferson considered the large staircase to be a waste of space and a display of aristocratic pomposity. But guests at Monticello complained that it was almost impossible to climb the two-foot wide stairways to the upper levels.44 Thomas Jefferson of course was not a metaphysician in the German style but was more influenced by French sensationalism and British/ Scottish empiricism. But the dialectic of expression and representation characterizing Kant and Hegel's aesthetics translates into an aesthetic technology in Jefferson's many building efforts. "For him architecture was as important for social engineering as was UVA's curriculum."45 According to some, Jefferson valued his founding of the University of Virginia above almost any other achievement. The forging of the University combines the technology of self-expression already in play at Monticello (and Poplar Forest) with the Uncle and the Abb?'s mimetic-didactic goals. The designed correspondence of material and idea creates a haunted space over which Jefferson's spirit is still supposed to loom. Garry Wills writes: "But the spirit of the place still breathes from the very ensemble of its buildings. . . . The school has gone through some very dark periods. But the Jeffersonian spirit can always be regenerated from the very fact that its physical expression is so legible" (64-65).Jefferson's Rotunda, like Monticello, is commonly associated with Classical sources, most clearly the Pantheon. As Wilson explains, Jefferson's interior, however, departs from its Classical model. "Jefferson knew," he writes, that the Pantheon was originally a pagan temple of worship, the form of which, according to Leoni, "bears the figure of the World, or is round." Through applied art and decoration, the dome frequently came to rep? resent heaven or the cosmos. And the dome had been appropriated for several of the greatest structures of Christianity. Jefferson, wary of cosmol? ogy, transformed the dome into a library, into a temple of enlightenment for education. Significantly, he intended the concave ceiling to function as a planetarium; it would be painted blue and spangled with gilt stars that would be changeable; and Jefferson, always the tinkering inventor, designed a complicated movable sear for the operator. The dome of heaven became an instrument of modern science, and revelation was to be replaced with empiricism in a true spirit of enlightenment. ... In his scheme, the human is at the center, and the library is the mind of the University?the repository of wisdom, knowledge of the past, and ideas for the future. (71) The Dome of the Mind is an aesthetic illusion that does not con? tain itself, just as the classicizing aesthetic often attributed to both</page><page sequence="21">MLN 1001 Goethe and Jefferson produces its own excesses. (Goethe's dates are 1749-1832, Jefferson's are 1743-1826. Jefferson's two major building efforts on Monticello roughly parallel the time span of Goethe's two essays on Deutsche Baukunst) While Jefferson is the self-proclaimed father of the University of Virginia, one critic links him to his strange progeny?Edgar Allan Poe, a "son" of the University who attended UVA for a year in 1826?by way of a shared passion for Ossian.46 The Jeffersonian haunting allows one reader, Scott D. Peterson, to find Poe in Jefferson's architectural shadow while researching UVA for a novel on Poe. Peterson writes: Despite the protean quality of Poe at that time in his life, his room on the West Range, the classic order [of] the Lawn, and the hushed splendor of the Dome Room in the Rotunda all had a timeless quality to them that allowed me to place him amid the students of 1826 with their uniform coats, riding boots, and pistols tucked in their belts. He would be the one sitting by himself on the steps of the Rotunda.47 "Jefferson liked control," one scholar notes.48 But the physics and economics of construction far outstripped Jefferson's reach. The nar? rative of Jefferson as builder?the visionary who embodies republican ideas?of course relies on the atrocities of slavery. During the 1820's, the University of Virginia was plagued by rioting and violent excesses on the part of its students, spoiled and entitled plantation sons who regularly whipped and beat their often European professors.49 Jef? ferson tried to design an academical village that, like the Rotunda, would embody the spirit of Bildung and draw its students up the living ladder of the mind. Construction included an Anatomical Theatre for the dissection of cadavers that was placed outside the academical village and followed no classical pattern. In 1939, that building was demolished and replaced by a new library.
