The Oedipus Tyrannus is an excellent candidate for such an exercise, for Aristotle chose it as his favorite exemplar of the effects of tragedy. When the Poetics were rediscovered in the Renaissance, that judgment again surround- ed the Tyrannus with its aura of celebrity and gave it a privileged place as the out- standing Greek tragedy that it has enjoyed ever since. Hence the choice of the Tyran- nus to inaugurate Palladio's splendid Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza in 1585.' One could easily use the numerous adaptations of the Tyrannus across the centu- ries as the basis for a literary and intellectual history of Western culture.2 To take a few specific examples, the versions of Corneille (1659), Dryden and Nathaniel Lee (1678), and Voltaire (1718) all add subplots in accordance with the taste of baroque or neo-classical drama and as a counterbalance to the ugliness of the incest. Corneille is particularly concerned to restore to the story the nobility and bienscance that he felt the taste of his time demanded, and both he and Dryden-Lee are concerned that the dignity of kingship not be compromised. Corneille thus recasts the killing of Laius into a form that exonerates both kings, particularly Oedipus (Act IV, scene 3).3 Voltaire 1.

They also virtually anticipate Freud in the suggestion of a subconscious erotic attrac- tion between Oedipus and Jocasta;5 and they look back to Shakespeare with a Creon cast as a black villain who closely resembles Shakespeare's Richard III and a sleep- walking scene obviously drawn from Macbeth. The nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers feel even less constrained by the classical texts and by the classical notions of tragic form. Von Platen produced a comic version (1828), and Cocteau's La Machine infernale of about a century later (1934) is also a comedy of sorts, though a dark comedy. His play and the slightly earlier Oedipe of Gide (1930) lace the action with self-conscious anachronisms and humorous ironies.6 Hofmannsthal's postromantic Oedipus und die Sphinx (1905), though in a far more elevated and serious mood, anticipates Cocteau's oneiric atmosphere and replaces Sophocles' focus on the paradoxes of knowledge and ignorance with a more inward- looking confrontation with the mysteries of the self, perhaps drawing on Wagnerian themes of the incest as the search and fulfillment of the male hero's search for his true identity.7 Choosing even one aspect of the play, like the characterization of Jocasta, or the encounter with the Sphinx, or the death of Laius, would be illuminating for the range of possible variation within this most stable-looking part of the classical tradi- tion and for the changes of taste and outlook at different periods in European literature. Thomas Halter's Kdnig Oedipus is among the most recent of the numerous at- tempts to follow the "long story of Oedipus the King."8 Halter (henceforth H.) ap- proaches the issue through the selection of specific scenes and passages, but he is more interested in language than in plot construction, and he takes a synchronic rather than diachronic view. This approach, as we shall see, brings both advantages and problems. Although H. occasionally uses his stylistic analysis as a springboard for broader obser- vations on the cultural context and outlook of the later writers, his book consists primarily in close textual analyses of passages from the Oedipus plays of Seneca, Corneille, Dryden, Cocteau, Gide, Hofmannstahl, and occasionally from Von Platen's comic adaptation. His focus, moreover, is on Sophocles' play rather than on its succes- sors; and his comparative study aims primarily at revealing the unique verbal and dramatic skills of the ancient work. Sometimes he examines extended passages, some- times only a line or two; sometimes he compares OT with a single later play, some- times with several. His observations range from a paragraph or two to several pages. They are organized into nine chapters, under large general categories, such as "The 4. See Frick (above, n. 2) 362ff. 5.

The book is in effect a literary commentary on OT through the eyes of the seven major successors listed above. There is an analytical table of contents, an excellent bibliogra- phy, a useful index locorum, but no general index. H. s close readings are always stimulating and often bring to light seldom noted details or fine nuances of expression. H. everywhere shows his enthusiastic apprecia- tion of Sophocles. Yet in his renewal of the "quarrel between the ancients and moderns" his admiration for the Greek play is sometimes too warm. In his view the later works, when compared to the directness and simplicity of OT, appear as subjective, cluttered, or awkward, and rarely does a post-Sophoclean author come out ahead. In this respect H. shows some affinities with a certain kind of post-romantic view of the Greeks, who are supposed to see life steadily and see it whole and who possess the unblinking clarity and almost childlike directness of a pre-conceptual age. At times H.'s method recalls Schiller's contrast of "naive and sentimental poetry," at times Arnoldian "touch- stones," and at other times an Auerbach-like deduction from small details of language and style to large generalizations about ancient versus modern organizations of reali- ty. Unfortunately, H.'s isolation of individual passages and his primarily linguistic and formalistic approach sometimes produce distortions; and the questions that H. asks and the categories under which he classifies his selection of texts, though sugges- tive, are not always entirely fair to the particular aesthetic or cultural contexts of the later works. H. compares Sophocles' OT 78-8 and Corneille's Oedipe 354-56: IE. AXA' cEi 1icxk6v o z' c0nta o'di ' dprio0 Kpeovxa npoooteiXovta oalltaivouoi JIot. OI.

Que son visage montre un esprit disold. H. wants to show that "Sophocles reflects the world" whereas Corneille "interprets the world" (16). Whereas Sophocles gives us a visual impression of Creon's "bright face," Corneille (who, as H. rightly points out, reverses Oedipus' mood) interprets the scene in the subjectivizing "un esprit disold." This is an interesting idea, but other elements of context and style need to be considered. Both dramatists in fact show us their charac- ter interpreting what they see. Sophocles, H. suggests, creates a more dynamic, move- ment-filled, and concretely visualized scene through the references to the "brightness" of Creon's "eye" and gait and especially the present participle, tpoaaEitxovra, which emphasizes the immediacy of the action and sets the events rapidly into motion ("Wiihrend das Wort fiallt, kommt Kreon nidher," p. 17). Corneille's effects, however, are quite different, for reasons that H. does not explore. Sophocles has taken great pains to</page><page sequence="4">218 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2000 introduce his protagonist in a public and ritual setting, and the meeting with Creon through the Priest's mediation belongs to that public context. Corneille, on the other hand, has introduced his Jocasta much earlier into the action, and his Oedipus' first encounter with the news from Delphi thus takes place in a more private mood. "Del- phes a parld," instead of a reference to Apollo, also reflects Corneille's adaptation of "pagan" material to a very different sense of divine authority, more solemn, more remote, and less anthropomorphic. Corneille's radical recasting of the opening of his play, moreover, bears on his basic conception of the characters and the action in ways that make some aspects of H.'s comparison problematical. Sophocles' opening scene of priest and citizens suppli- cating the ruler makes Creon's arrival from Delphi a tense, indeed critical moment. Corneille, however, opens his play with his new subplot, the love of Thisbe for Dirc6, Jocaste's daughter by Laius. Oedipe's concerns are all for the dynastic problems that this marriage creates, and he immediately immerses us in the kind of court intrigue and internal power struggles that would appeal to the subjects of Le Roi Soleil. The arrival of the messenger, Dymas, in the passage cited above, in fact, interrupts a conversation of Oedipe and Jocaste on these problems of royal marriages. Not only is Dymas a far less important character than Sophocles' Creon, but also the reason for Dymas' mission to Delphi has not yet been explained. This emerges only in the follow- ing scene, after which the play returns to the subplot in a taut scene between an imperious Oedipe and a proud, recalcitrant Dirc6 (II.1). Thus Corneille's lines have far less of the tense expectation that surrounds the Sophoclean equivalent, and it is quite misleading to treat them as if they stand on the same level of dramatic importance. Dymas' arrival, however, is interesting for a reason very different from anything that H. discusses, namely the fact that Corneille is having a bit of intertextual fun with his messenger's arrival, for Delphi's refusal to answer Dymas' question justifies Corneille's switch from the Sophoclean motif of consulting Apollo's oracle to the Senecan motif of Teiresias' calling up the shade of Laius from Hades (end of Act I and Act II, scene 3). Corneille thereby shows us that he knows the Sophoclean play but is deliberately choosing the Senecan version. The impression of the ancient poet's "objective," childlike directness of vision, in contrast to modern complexity and subjectivity, becomes particularly misleading when one looks more closely at both the syntax and context of these lines. Sophocles' effect depends, paradoxically, on the peculiar density of his dramatic style, which can bring together in two verses dominated by the mystery of the god's oracular voice "chance," "savior," "brightness," "eye," and "walking" - all in one way or another words loaded with ironies that are central to the play. The elusive syntax of hagLtp6i, "bright", works almost as a kind of zeugma, where the adjective has a literal meaning with "eye," but a metaphorical sense with "walk." One result of this dense phrasing is to bring walking and seeing together in a conjunction whose full meaning will occur only later, e.g., in Teiresias' prophecy of Oedipus' blind walking in 454-57. Sophocles has purchased this effect at the cost of an odd telescoping of time that runs counter to the apparent visual clarity of Oedipus' exclamation, for the Priest immediately replies to Oedipus with his conjecture that Creon is indeed happy because of the wreath he wears (82f.), a feature of the "approaching" figure that would, one should think, be far more easily visible than the "face," let alone the "eye" (taking omma literally).9 Oedi- 9. On the problem see the excellent note of R. D. Dawe, ed., Sophocles, Oedipus Rex (Cambridge 1982) ad loc.</page><page sequence="5">Review Articles 219 pus' cry "O Lord Apollo" in 80, moreover, is the first of several cries to the gods the tone of which changes radically as the action advances (e.g., 646, 738, 1009, 1037, 1060, 1169, 1329). And, to go further afield, does this critical moment of "seeing" someone "approaching" who may bring doom or joy echo in an even more fateful scene with an "elder" in the recollected moment when Laius, at the crossroads, sees Oedipus walk- ing by his chariot (807f.): ical p 6i xpopu; ch 6p, /6Xou; xapacteixovta ... ? H. goes on here to compare Sophocles' scene with the arrival of Creon in Sen., Oed. 205f., and he makes a similar point about the more indirect, "interpretive" style of the Latin writer. But Seneca's scene, with its emphasis on Oedipus' emotional state (horrore quatior), not only comes at a different point in its play but also has a very different context. Sophocles' Oedipus faces outward to the whole city, symbolically present in the delegation of elders who form the chorus. Seneca opens his play with a much more private and inward Oedipus; and the city, which looms so large in Sopho- cles' background, is much vaguer in Seneca's. H. contrasts the "childlike" vision of Sophocles that can directly mirror back experience with Seneca's more "subjective" description of Oedipus' future in Oed. 656f., repet incertus viae / baculo senili triste praetemptans iter ("He will creep forth uncer- tain of his way, feeling his sad road ahead of him with his aged staff"). But again considerations of context make one hesitate. Sophocles' Teiresias speaks these lines as his final pronouncement to an Oedipus who has either exited or who is about to exit, whereas Seneca's lines are reported by Creon from the speech of Laius' ghost, which Teiresias has called forth from Hades, and it comes at the end of an extended rhesis by Creon (530-658). The two pronouncements, then, are hardly on the same level of authority. Sophocles' Teiresias speaks, as it were, in the full light of day, and his exit highlights the issue of truth and falsehood that introduced him ("truth," OT 299; "lies" and "good sense," 461f.); Seneca's lines are spoken by a ghostly apparition from the nether world endowed with the horrific authority of that setting. The exit of Sopho- cles' Teiresias leaves the chorus torn between its belief in Oedipus and its respect for Teiresias's prophetic power. Seneca's scene continues with the somatic effects of the terror that Creon's horrific account immediately inspires in Oedipus' already troubled breast (et ossa et artus gelidus invasit tremor, 659). H. claims that OT's suppression of physical description at Teiresias' entrance elevates the figure of the prophet, for such details would necessarily include his blind- ness and helplessness, whereas the presence of such details in Seneca lowers his digni- ty (pp. 54f.). But the situation appears differently when one looks at the dramatic situations. Seneca's prophet enters as Creon finishes his account of Laius' death at the crossroads and immediately commands the necromantic rites, employing the signifi- cantly named Manto, his daughter and guide, as his assistant. The mode of his en- trance, then, is directly related to his mode of divination and to the lurid atmosphere of the scene that follows. Sophocles, on the other hand, uses Teiresias (in part) to deepen the ironic contrasts of knowledge and ignorance. By replacing the anonymous "these men" (die) who lead Sophocles' Teiresias (OT 297) with Manto, therefore, Seneca signals his departure from the Sophoclean version. H. juxtaposes the brevity of Sophocles' description of the plague's victims in OT 29f. with Gide's fuller details to point up Sophocles' greater sense of the dignity of the dying (pp. 57f.). This is an easy target, as Gide, of course, is deliberately irreverent toward all dignities. Yet even here H. is not entirely fair, for Sophocles gives us fuller details of the dying shortly before too (25-29) and elaborates considerably in the paro- dos later (168ff.). More useful would have been comparison with Seneca's very full</page><page sequence="6">220 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2000 account of the symptoms of the plague (Oed. 52-70 and 124-201, especially 180-201), drawn heavily from Lucretius and Virgil's Third Georgic. Whereas Seneca turns back to a literary intertext, Sophocles conveys the overwhelming power of the plague through the civic rituals of prayers, supplications, and paians (OT 2-5, 159-71, 183-88). For H. the contrast between the Theban citizens' prayers for survival in Sophocles and the wish for death in Seneca and Voltaire shows the Greek dramatist's feeling for "the strongest natural law in a living being" [H.'s emphasis], whereas Seneca "sacrifices probability to fascination with the extraordinary" (p. 86). This judgment perpetuates the old contrast of the "rhetorical" and the "natural" (a variation of Schiller's "naive" and "sentimental") that has hampered our proper appreciation of Senecan tragedy. Seneca's performative context and aesthetic aims are so totally different from Sopho- cles' that such decontextualized judgments can only mislead. In the passage under discussion, Seneca is deliberately creating an atmosphere of total, crushing supernatu- ral power brooding over Thebes that only Oedipus' expiatory sacrifice can remove. Similar limitations apply to H.'s comparison of Oedipus's ways of addressing Creon in Sophocles, Seneca, Corneille, and Gide. Sophocles' longer and more formal address in OT 85f., H. suggests, reflects Sophocles' subtle psychological sense of the solemnity of this moment, when Apollo's reply from Delphi is about to be announced (p. 76). In contrast to the later writers' "reflection" on this critical moment, Sophocles merely presents it, with greater "simplicity" ("lnsofern hebt sich Sophokles als der 'Ein- fache' von seinen Nachfolgern deutlich ab," p. 77). H. has a point, but simplicity is not a fully adequate criterion. The conventions of such forms of address in Greek tragedy need to be taken into account. Important too is the contrast with Oedipus' address to Creon in their next scene together, where Oedipus begins with the derogatory, "You there," otzo; o5 (OT 531). The dramatic pattern replicates the shift in the scene with Teiresias, from honorific appellation (all-knowing savior of the city, OT 300-4) to insult ("O basest of the base," 334). In an interesting note (p. 76, n. 66), H. draws attention to Oedipus' address to Jocasta in 950, also at a moment of dramatic tension, "O dearest head of my wife Jocasta." Here too the larger dramatic context would open other perspectives. Not only is this phrase Oedipus' only term of endearment to Jocas- ta (contrast his bare "O wife" at her entrance, 642), but it is echoed grimly by the Messenger who reports her death (1235). Going a step further, we note that this icdpa- formula has only two other occurrences in the play, namely in the Priest's statement of Oedipus' superlative power in the prologue (1 Kepd&amp;zloov x~&amp;aotw Oibixou cicp, 40) and in the chorus' anguished cry in their horror at discovering his crimes (i~i KX&amp;ktvov Oi8iio'u iccdpa, 1207). The contrasting contexts of the two Kdpa-formulas for Oedipus exactly parallel those of Jocasta (950, 1245). Is Sophocles so "simple" after all? Or is his complexity to be found in areas that cannot appear from the analysis of diction in isolated passages? H. remarks on the difference between the vagueness of time in Jocasta's account of the past and the specific "ten seasons" in Seneca (OT 735-37; Sen. Oed. 783; p. 20f.). Seneca's language of "adding" and "measuring," H. suggests, reflects his "post-con- ceptual" and more "abstract" way of thinking. But measuring time is in fact a major concern of Sophocles too (cf. OT 73f., 561, 1113, 1188), so that a much fuller analysis is necessary to show more precisely the ways in which Seneca is more "abstract" than Sophocles. The two scenes that H. compares, moreover, have very different dramatic functions. In Sophocles Jocasta's reckoning of time comes at the very beginning of Oedipus' inquiry; in Seneca it comes at the end. Immediately afterwards, Seneca's Corinthian Old Man enters with the news of Polybus' death (784), and this leads</page><page sequence="7">Review Articles 221 directly to Oedipus' discovery of the truth less than a hundred lines later. Here, as elsewhere (e.g., OT 561), Sophocles has specific dramatic reasons for his vagueness about time (in part, e.g., to mask the notorious problem of the interval between Laius' death and the Old Herdsman's return to Thebes). When it suits his purposes (e.g. OT 1135-37), Sophocles can be quite specific about time. More needs to be said too of the implied civic context of Jocasta's pi640p 6et (737, and cf. 850), in contrast to Seneca's world of inward feeling. H.'s contrast of "pre-conceptual" and "post-concep- tual" oversimplifies. H. contrasts "black Hades enriched with the groans and laments" of the plague's victims in OT 29f. with the allegorizing effect of Seneca's Mors avidos oris hiatus / pandit et omnis explicat alas (Oed. 164f.). For H. Seneca exemplifies a "postconceptual" mode of speech, whereas Sophocles' "preconceptual" language illustrates the Greek poet's capacity to produce an impression of greater "immediacy" and less "reflection" (p. 23). But, leaving aside the different dramatic contexts of the two descriptions, H. neglects to mention the fact that Seneca's lines come from a choral song that describes the breaking forth of monsters from Hades. It thus foreshadows the literal breaking forth of Laius' bloody ghost, with its horrible imprecations, in Teiresias' necromancy later in the play. Laius, in fact, will list Mors as the companion of Letum Luesque, Labor, Tabes, Dolor, the allegorized evils that Oedipus' punishment will finally purge from the land (652f.). Such descriptions, moreover, do not exist in a cultural vacuum. They belong to a long literary tradition that uses the release of monstrous chthonic beings to express the breakdown of cosmic and social order. Seneca is drawing particularly on a strong Latin tradition, familiar from Virgil's Allecto or Ovid's Tisiphone. Similarly, broad generalizations of the Geistesgeschichte type do not adequately explain the con- trast between the gestural concreteness of Sophocles (apropos of Creon's praise of the life of a private citizen) and the apparent one-sidedness of Seneca's Creon. One must also take into account such features of Seneca's literary background as the Stoic dia- tribe or the topoi of the vita beata and the simple life that look back to Lucretius, Virgil, and Horace, among others. Teiresias' allusion to Oedipus' accursed birth, in its suitably obscure mantic lan- guage, is a good example of how much complexity lies beneath the surface of Sopho- cles' supposed directness and clarity.10 His "double-smiting, terrible-footed curse from your mother and father" (d&amp;ChikSi 00y0p6o te xw ioi ao0 narpog / ... .Ev6xou S &amp;pcz, 417f.) is, of course, a grim play on the name of Oedipus, and so reminds us that he received no name from his parents, but only the injury that in fact gave him his name (cf. 1035f.). Through this language, moreover, Sophocles is also glancing at but deliberately suppressing the motif of the Erinys and the family curse in the Aeschyl- ean trilogy (cf. Septem 790f., viv 65 tp~io / pi) wXao0 aCyuixoug Eptvw6g ("Now I tremble lest the Fury who bends her foot [in speed] may fulfill [the curse]") and the similar "foot" image for the Erinys in Soph., El. 491 (Xa6Xl6nou dpdi, "bronze-footed curse"). "1 H. praises (p. 33) a similar directness in Oedipus' statement of his parent- age in OT 779f.: "My father is Polybus of Corinth, my mother Merope of Dorus." Yet 10. Halter discusses this passage on p. 19. 11. For discussion of OT 417f. see Segal (above, n. 2) 26; on the Erinyes here and elsewhere in Sophocles see R. P. Winnington-Ingram, Sophocles: An Interpretation (Cambridge 1980) 205- 16. The exact meaning of the hapax laji~iioum in Sept. 791 is disputed. Liana Lupas and Zoe Petre, Commentaire aux Sept contre Thebes d' Eschyle (Bucarest and Paris 1981) 246 remark that it "evoque la monstruosite et la vitesse miraculeuse de I'Frinys."</page><page sequence="8">222 Inlternational Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2000 this passage contains one of the sharpest ironies of the play, namely that the simplest of all personal statements, "My father is X, my mother is Y," is so fraught with error and ignorance. Sophocles' taut dramatic structure uses "father" and "mother" as load- ed words that resonate powerfully throughout the play. H. neglects another problem of cultural context when he compares Oedipus' open- ing autobiographical statement here with Voltaire's equivalent, "Le destin m'a fait naftre au thrdne de Corinte." H. criticizes Voltaire for weakening Oedipus' resonant and spe- cific statement to "le destin." Precisely one of the difficulties for the postclassical life of Greek drama, however, is the foreignness of the names of Greek mythical figures. Directors of modern productions of Greek plays (as well as those of us who teach these plays in translation) have to struggle constantly with their audiences' ignorance of Greek myths and unfamiliarity with polysyllabic Greek names. Voltaire's elision of both the names and nationalities of the foster parents is an elegant solution to the problem. H. juxtaposes Voltaire's verse with the far closer translation of Dryden and Lee: "I need not tell you, Corinth claims my birth; / My Parents, Polybus and Merope, / Two Royal Names; their only Child am I." H. notes Dryden's elimination of the top- onyms and adds in parentheses "only for the sparing of his audience?" Dryden then comes in for his share of criticism because of his "pathetic" touches like "claims," "royal names," and "only child" (p. 33). It would have been more fruitful for the history of the classical tradition to observe the two different solutions to the same problem, which H. has quite corrected intuited, albeit too timidly, in his parenthetical question about audience. H. compares OT 1124-27 and Seneca Oed. 843-46 to demonstrate how Seneca presents his world through a vertical, Sophocles through a horizontal organization (pp. 35-37). Sophocles' Herdsman tells how he spent most of his life pasturing flocks on Cithaeron or the places nearby. Seneca's dialogue between king and herdsman (called Phorbas) has two instances of the preposition sub: Oed. regnum optinente Laio famulus greges agitasti opimos sub Cithaeronis plaga? Phorb. laetus Cithaeron pabulo semper novo aestiva nostro prata summittit gregi. H.'s point is interesting, but again the literary-historical context suggests other consid- erations as well. Seneca's adjectives laetus and opimus, for example, and his phrase aestiva prata (in contrast to Sophocles' poimnai and chdra) belong to a literary tradition formed by Theocritus and Virgil. Seneca's language leaves us in doubt as to whether he had ever seen a real shepherd, whereas Sophocles' herdsman is not "bucolic," even in 1132-40. Comparing Sophocles and Voltaire H. points out both the often observed fact that OT lets the various parts of Oedipus' oracle emerge only piecemeal and the less often observed fact that Oedipus includes the maternal incest every time that he mentions his oracle, whereas Jocasta mentions only the parricide and brings up the incest only in response to Oedipus' insistence, and then only to dismiss it (pp. 43-45). This detail, H. suggests, is part of Sophocles' noble characterization of Jocasta, so that Sophocles "maintains and preserves modesty" in her mode of speaking (p. 45). True, but one needs to add this culture's insistence on women's reticence in sexual matters (except, of course, in the topsy-turvy world of comedy).</page><page sequence="9">Review Articles 223 Coming back to Oedipus' oracle in a later chapter on the author's suppression of his own knowledge of the plot, H. praises Sophocles (alone among the various ver- sions) for the order incest-parricide in 790-93 because it shows Sophocles reading his character from inside, as it were, as one who cannot yet know the true order of these events and so expresses them as "scarcely graspable, painful images" which at this point can have only an "emotional ordering" (Gefiihls-Ordnung) rather than a "correct or incorrect sequence" (p. 107). Earlier, apropos of Sophocles' characterization of Jocas- ta, H. made the excellent point that her and Oedipus' different ways of speaking of their oracles contribute to the delay in discovering the truth (44f.). One may add that the order in which Oedipus reports his oracle (incest and parricide before the recogni- tion, parricide and incest after) produces a similar effect and so helps explain his persistence in his ignorance of the truth.12 H.'s close reading also brings out Oedipus' capacity for family affection, as when he asks why Polybus so loved (otEpt~e) a child that he received from another's hands (1023, p. 47). One may add that such hints of Oedipus' involvement in the bonds of family help prepare for his otherwise unexpected request for his daughters at the end.13 In like manner reading Sophocles against the later versions (including Eurip- ides' Phoenissae) brings out his reticence about the physical details of the pierced feet (Jocasta, in fact, calls them "yoked," not actually "pierced," OT 718) or about the details of just what the foster parents told Oedipus in order to explain the drunkard's taunt of bastardy (pp. 49-52). Comparison can often reveal features of Sophocles' text that one takes for grant- ed, as H. shows in his admiration for the brevity of Oedipus' cry at the moment of discovery, iou, iou (pp. 92-100). Yet in ranking the recognition speech of the Senecan Oedipus below that of the Sophoclean, H. asks, "What hearer/reader can recognize himself in the Latin Oedipus?" (p. 96). But Seneca's highly rhetorical style rests more on the audience's sense of mounting horror in this nightmarish world of chthonic powers than on identifying in any vraisemblable way with the protagonist. Oedipus' opening dehisce tellus, with its abruptness, its ensuing address to the ruler of the shades to carry him off to the lowest depths of Tartarus, and its universalizing hyperboles, needs to be viewed alongside Seneca's substitution of the necromantic appearance of Laius' ghost for Teiresias' prophecy in OT. Halter's discussion of the equivalent scene in Corneille (96f.) is representative of the limitations of his linguistic approach. One will easily agree that the long speech of Corneille's Oedipe at the horrendous moment of recognition fails to convey the stab of agony that the suffering itself seems to draw out of the Sophoclean hero in his cry of iou iou and the brief, twisted expressions that follow (OT 1182-85). Yet the conven- tions, aims, and cultural horizons of Corneille and his theater are radically different from Sophocles', and these differences need more attention than they receive. Cor- neille's Oedipe exhibits a neo-Stoic heroism and the ideals of noble kingship that pervade every word of this speech. He insists on his life of virtue, duty, and honor, and he never acknowledges his guilt. For Sophocles' Oedipus, the horror of the pollu- tion blots out everything else, and he feels himself completely crushed. Only later does he regain a kind of heroic strength on a new basis, when he can recognize that "only (he) can endure his sufferings (OT 1415f.). Corneille's Oedipe never really bends be- fore what he sees as the cruelty of the gods. 12. See Brian Vickers, Towards Greek Tragedy (London 1979), 500-13; Segal (above, n. 2) 61. 13.

Yet the criterion of being "convincing" involves a lot of implicit judgments about the contexts, aesthetics, and purposes of these very different dramas. Ultimately it sacrifices a historical situating of these works to a rather subjec- tive and contemporary notion of verisimilitude. Corneille and Voltaire, who both wrote extensively on their differences from Sophocles, obviously thought their heroes' speeches were, at some level, convincing. Exploring their different notions of "convincing" here would have been stimulating and fruitful. The same is true of the corresponding scenes, different as they are from the above, in the existentialist Oedipe of Gide and the more outrageously comic La machine infernale of Cocteau, that H. examines briefly from the same limited perspective (99f.). Along with pollution, Sophocles' play assumes another institution that needs to be taken into account in these comparisons, namely slavery. In comparing Oedipus' question to the Corinthian, "Did you buy (empolisas) me or having sired me give me to him?" (OT 1025), to Seneca's tu me parenti tradis; at quis me tibi? (Oed. 807), H. makes the excellent point that Sophocles does a better job of writing from the perspective of a character who is completely ignorant of what the answer will be, whereas Seneca lets his authorial knowledge of the full plot color the question. But the Sophoclean formu- lation also has a culturally specific meaning, that is, Oedipus' fear of being found the child of a slave (particularly given the pejorative associations of being "bought"; cf. 1123). The cultural context of a slave-owning society also qualifies some of H.'s generali- zations from his contrasts between OT's Old Herdsman and the corresponding charac- ter in Corneille, Dryden, and Voltaire (pp. 87-89). The later writers transform this figure into a worthy combatant who is nearly killed in his battle to defend his king. For Sophocles, H. suggests, the flight of the slave shows a "recognition of human weakness," which H. again associates with Sophocles' naturalness and truth in con- trast to the artifice of the later writers ("das Kunstprodukt des fehlerlosen Menschen ist ihm fremd," p. 89). H. is right in so far as all three of these later versions are concerned, in varying degrees, to maintain the dignity and nobility of a king. Yet aside from the conventions of Greek plot structure, which avoids subplots and the elaboration of secondary characters, we must again keep in mind the distinction between slave and free that is so vital to defining the individual in this society (e.g., OT 1063, Antig. 517). The democratic ethos of fifth- and fourth-century Athens does not extend to slaves, as Plato and Aristotle embarrassingly show. H. compares Oedipus' curse on the killer in Sophocles, Seneca, and Voltaire to bring out the point, noted above, that Sophocles does not intrude his authorial per- spective, whereas the two later writers both frame the curse in terms of its later fulfillment (107-10). But in considering the terms of the Sophoclean Oedipus' curse on the murderer one again needs to factor in the cultural context, for here, as in the prologue, Sophocles' language reflects the play's rootedness in the ritual and commu- nal life of the Greek polls and reminds us again of the difference between the public and ritual setting of Greek drama and the more private, narrower aesthetic of most later tragedy. It weakens H.'s case, moreover, that Sophocles' authorial prescience</page><page sequence="11">Review Articles 225 clearly has shaped such passages as Oedipus' insulting of Teiresias, "blind in ears, mind, and eyes" (OT 370-77), with a view to the ironic reversals later. H.'s juxtaposition of OT 438, i8 ifspa x 4~, G0E ocai t &amp;at00Epc, "This day will give you birth and will destroy you," with the versions of Corneille and Voltaire (pp. 100-2) is a good example of the strengths and weaknesses of H.'s touchstone method. Voltaire's almost literal translation, "Ce jour va vous donner la naissance et la mort," he notes, misses the "magic-demonic" quality in the Sophoclean symmetry of the two verbs, with its implications of the cyclical rhythms of mortal life (and one should add the effect of the homoeoteleuton and symmetrical division of the verse by the caesura). Ati8OEpd, H. observes, is in its vagueness richer than Voltaire's "la mort," for it leaves open the form of Oedipus' "destruction." One may add also that it contributes to the ambiguity of the Sophoclean Oedipus' "seeing the light for the last time" in his exit at 1183. Yet within OT as a whole the verb phuein is an important word, associated with origins and identity as well as begetting. It is far more than "naissance." Voltaire's line, moreover, comes at a very different place in his play and in a very different kind of scene. Among other things, it is followed by a characteristically Voltairean touch of anticlericalism, put in the mouth of Philoctete (act III, scene 5). The larger context of Voltaire's play, furthermore, does hold a further meaning for "la naissance et la mort," for it points ahead to the redemptive "rebirth" that this Oedipus will, in fact, achieve in Voltaire's lightly Christianized version of the Senecan ending, announced by the same Priest who pronounced the prophecy cited above (act V, scene 6). H.'s last three chapters, on tragedy and comedy, on Oedipus' encounter with the Sphinx, and on the "Silence of Sophocles" (the last on the question of Oedipus' guilt in killing Laius and on the ending) are somewhat less interesting, perhaps because H.'s method of textual comparison has less to offer on these complex and much discussed issues. In his detailed discussion of the slaying of Laius (pp. 133-42), H. claims that Sophocles merely presents the event objectively, with no attempt on Oedipus' part to defend himself, in strong contrast to all the later writers. Sophocles, of course, is very far from Corneille and Voltaire, who tone down the parricide in various ways; but H. pays too little attention to some of the problematical details of the Sophoclean Oedi- pus' narrative, particularly pros bian in OT 805. And how exactly are we to view his "I strike in anger" (mio0 &amp;t 6pyfl, 807), or the clipped, "I kill them all" (813)? A glance at Euripides' Phoenissae 39-44 here would be instructive. More too needs to be said about the motif of pollution that follows immediately upon Oedipus' narrative, for this, rather than the killing of Laius per se, is in the forefront of his anxiety (OT 813-33). Fairness to Seneca, for instance, would demand noting his very different perspective on Oedipus' guilt, where pollution is subordinated to the terrible accusations of the risen ghost of the murdered father and king (Oed. 634-37). Seneca thus sets Oedipus' guilt into the dark atmosphere of necromancy and its horrors, which in turn enable him to show the attack from the side of the dead victim. Although H.'s enthusiasm for Sophocles and his isolation of single passages re- sult in some of the exaggeration and one-sidedness that we have noted, his book reveals, in countless details, the inexhaustible richness of Sophocles' play. That H. brings this so clearly into view is one of the virtues of his book. Despite the limitations of H.'s method, this book exemplifies the value of close reading and makes a convinc- ing case not only for the extraordinariness of Sophocles' play but also for the unique combination of poetic and dramatic power in Greek tragedy generally. How irrecover- able the artistic achievement of Greek drama is, even by Sophocles' most gifted imita-</page><page sequence="12">226 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2000 tors in later periods, emerges clearly from H.'s close linguistic comparisons. It would have emerged even more clearly, and in greater depth, however, had H. included a fuller consideration of dramatic structure, ritual elements, and cultural and historical contexts.
