<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Rothberg's The Sword of the Golem : The Use of the Fantastic in Defense of Judaism Peter G. Christensen Arnold L. Goldsmith, writing in 1981 in The Golem Remembered, 1909-1980, calls Abra- ham Rothberg's deeply moving novel, The Sword of the Golem (1980) the "most significant work of fiction on the Golem of Prague in the last fifty years (that is, since H. Leivick's The Golem [1921]), and the major American contribution to the literary treat- ment of the legend" (120). So far, Goldsmith's chapter on The Sword of the Golem remains the only sustained piece of criticism on this work, although useful background information is supplied by Rothberg himself in the essay, "What Time Is It Now?," pub- lished in the Summer 1973 issue of Southwest Review. Goldsmith's interpretation highlights more of the secular di- mensions of the novel than the religious. He sees Rabbi Low as a split personality and uses such Freudian terms as "id" and "super- ego" to describe the Golem and Rabbi Low, respectively. Gold- smith also shows where Rothberg is indebted to his principal influence, Leivick, and where he has borrowed from the Talmud and Jewish legends. On a thematic level he concentrates on the readers' doubts about the rabbi's motivations, the moral debate concerning the justifiability of violence, and the use of motifs inherited from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Absent from his sensitive discussion of the novel, however, is the thesis we wish to explore. Rothberg's novel uses the fantastic to defend not only Jews against persecution but also Judaism against Christianity. To provide a background perspective, we will first present an overview of the contemporary relevance of Rothberg's novel form. Then we will discuss the fantastic with reference to the creation of the Golem, the Christian plot to convict the Jews of the fabricated blood libel, and the great public debate between the apologists for the Christians and the Jews. Finally, the rational thought of the great medieval scholar, Moses 163</page><page sequence="2">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic Maimonides, mentioned twice in the novel (127, 141), will be explored. Rothberg himself does not mention this defense of Judaism in his own essay, but he does stress the fact that he wanted to write a symbolic novel with contemporary relevance. He tells of being inspired in 1963 to write his novel after taking a walk through the "still medieval ghetto of Prague" and coming upon the grave of the High Rabbi Judah Low, who died in 1609 ("Time," 193). Investi- gating the Nazi period, he found that, of the 360,000 Jews who had lived in Czechoslovakia in 1939, only 55,000 survived by 1948. Of the 5,000 Jews living in Prague in 1963, apparently "almost none of them came to the synagogue, or even wished openly to be identified as Jews" (203). The trip to Prague prompted Rothberg to write "not a historical novel but a truly contemporary one, a novel not on sixteenth-century Prague but on our own troubled twentieth century" (208). Rothberg expresses his belief that human beings are golems. We are also to conclude that we live in a world which will have to survive without the direct intervention of God. He makes it clear that God will not enter the world to rid it of evil. This contempo- rary notion represents a break with the usual depiction of the golem in the tradition of German Jews from the fifteenth century onward. The German-Jewish tradition combines three elements: legends of the resurrection of the dead, ideas from non-Jewish alchemical circles, and fear of "unrestrained powers of the ele- ments which can bring about destruction and havoc" ( [Sword , 755). Although Rothberg retains the third motif, i.e. that of the golem "running amok," he uses the golem to represent man: I knew man was golem - the golem...because it was man who was truly an unfinished creation, whose substance was unformed. Golmi. Perhaps even ma/formed from birth and ¿feformed there- after. And because he was man and human he was replete with violence, hatred, viciousness, lust, and ambition, forever afflicted with the y etzer hara ("Time," 207). Rothberg continues to reflect on the human inclination for evil, the yetzer hara, affirming the traditional notion that it can be partially subdued and made subject to deeds of goodness and purity. Unstated here is the idea that God does not intervene in the world by sending a Messiah. However, close to the end of The 164</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen Sword of the Golem, this belief is revealed indirectly: The time of the Golem would remain with them until the coming of the Messiah because everything was fatal propensity and impulse, yetzer, in the time of the Golem the brute spirit of man could not be straightened, its crookedness would forever be an affliction (232). In his essay Rothberg maintains that "the time of the Golem" should be interpreted as the life of humanity, or the human condi- tion itself. We must reject the interpretation that the "time of the Golem" in the novel is an interlude before the Messiah does finally come. The novel does not hold out this kind of eschatological hope. We are forced to live righteously and compassionately because this life is the only one we have. The treatment of everyday human life as the time of the Golem can be applied in two ways. First, Rothberg would not be sympa- thetic to such a phenomenon as, for example, the anticipation of the Messiah prevalent among members of some contemporary Hasidic communities. Jews should not fall into the trap of waiting for the Messiah's first coming, which only parallels the mistaken hope of the Christians for the Second Coming. The novel's second level of relevance is also a post-1970 one. It finds its application in the fear among many Israelis and American Jews that Israel has been corrupted by gaining the West Bank through a defensive war. Thus we see confirmed Rabbi Low's suspicions that even killing in self-defense can turn a human into a creature no better than the enemy. Because this is the time of the Golem, even the righteous can be corrupted. Despite its limitations as a literary history, Tzvétan Todorov's work on the fantastic, when applied simply as a taxonomy, offers a useful point of departure for analyzing the treatment of the Golem in Rothberg's novel. Since Todorov lays much stress on the epistemological nature of fantastic literature, he can be a valuable guide in analyzing the figure of the golem, Joseph. We need to remember that the location of the fantastic hesitation lies between the explained uncanny on the one hand and the unex- plained marvelous on the other (Todorov, 41). On the surface level the Golem seems to be a marvelous creature. He is made out of clay through a ritual process that uses special incantations, and thus we entertain no doubts about whether he exists or not. Instead, the fantastic hesitation is displaced onto his nature. Is the 165</page><page sequence="4">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic Golem "programmed" to be the savior of the Jewish community or its destroyer? Rabbi Low tells Jacob Nissan that "if we are not free of every base ambition and sinful thought, then we shall be in danger of our very lives, for we shall have used the holy name of the Lord in vain" (4). The rabbi's uneasiness is specifically grounded in the fantastic hesitation, since he has an unsettling conversation with the Golem that his companions are mysteriously unable to hear (6-7). The conversation leaves open two possibilities connected with the Golem's capacity for violence. First, the rabbi and his community are not pure or worthy enough to be saved with supernatural assistance, and thus they will be left with a golem they cannot control. Second, the desire for a savior is misguided in itself because it causes us to lose sight of the role that the righteous must play in making God's designs operative in the world through good deeds and compassion. Nevertheless, the opening scene closes with the hope that the Golem will actually be able to save the Jews of Prague. The Golem promises not to take his own initiative, presumably toward vio- lence. The Golem says to the rabbi, "you have lifted me from the earth, wrung me from clay. What you propose, I shall obey" (8). In response, Rabbi Low tells him that "you shall be a great hero to your people" (8). Rothberg's presentation of the creation of the Golem indi- cates more continuity with the material in the Ashkenazi texts of the Middle Ages than with Sefardí texts about the golem from the same period. According to Moshe Idei, the two major Jewish communities took a different attitude toward the creation of the creature. Unlike the Ashkenazi accounts, which require only certain conditions of purity, Sefardí accounts which "elaborate on the issue of the golem, end with a warning," as in the writings of Meir Abulafia of Toledo (1170-1244), or else "the act of material creation is presented as an inferior activity to be transcended by intellectual creation" (33). Idei also comments that, in the case of the Sefardí Moses Cordovero (1522-1570), a teacher of the great Isaac Luria, the creation of the golem is "Presented as a totally meaningless activity from the spiritual point of view" - an idea never put forward in the Ashkenazi accounts (33). These statements have more than historical interest when we 166</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen return to The Sword of the Golem. First, as in the Ashkenazi tradition, the warning is not part of the text used for the Golem's creation. It is Rabbi Low's doubts that constitute a warning to us. Second, no contrast between the spiritual and the material is developed. Instead, Rothberg stresses potentiality for either good or evil in the Golem's personality. The second point relates to the first, since the reader is asked to analyze the moral effect of the Golem's deeds on the community. The fantastic hesitation is wisely placed on the level of Rabbi Low's doubts rather than on external warnings, for they are easier to connect to the specific situation of debating the use of violence in preserving the commu- nity. Joseph is not a miraculous savior, as we learn from the traits he develops when the community faces the accusation of killing a Christian for blood to mix in the Passover matzah meal. We read: "Though the Golem did the Lord's bidding in the nights.... Rabbi Low knew that the vetzer lurked in all beings" (20). The reader is also unnerved to find that Joseph likes to spend his free hours in the cemetery: he "often went to the 'garden of the dead' to rest and find quiet for his turbulent spirit" (22). Soon Joseph burns the agents of the evil priest Thaddeus in their own fires and cuts off the Voytek's finger in a single stroke. Consequently, the rabbi asks pointedly, Would the Lord have strengthened my spirit and my hands to mold the Golem's clay into a living creature had I sinned so grievously? Or has the Lord punished us by allowing me to create a scourge, not a redeemer? (25). The answer to the last question turns out to be "yes," since the Golem is capable of corrupting the community through his deeds of violence. This interpretation of Joseph is foregrounded by Goldsmith when he goes so far as to say that "the golem is man's unleashed id" (135). Goldsmith, however, does not mention Rothberg's message that we should not put our hopes in supernatural deliverance. On this thematic level, the Golem is not the id at all but the embodi- ment of hope for God's marvelous spiritual intervention. This point only becomes clear when the references to Passover, the Eucharist, and the false accusations of ritual murder (blood libel) are used to contextualize Joseph's deeds. Rothberg believes that 167</page><page sequence="6">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic the Jewish Passover seder is a more viable religious ceremony than the post-Tridentine Catholic Eucharist because the element of the marvelous is lesser in the former. Passover does remind us of the marvelous deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, but this foun- dational event remains in the past, relived during the seder on a psychological and spiritual level only. On the other hand, transub- stantiation requires the marvelous to continue into the present day and, unfortunately, it requires us to suspend rational thinking. The Christian plot against the Jews exemplifies the ill effects of the abandonment of reason. The plot against the Jews is a fantasized projection of the Catholic notion of blood-wine as nourishing food onto the idea of blood as recipe ingredient, with the result that Christians view Jews not as Jews but as blood-drinking Christians. The key scene is, of course, the celebration of Easter late in the novel. The Golem asks Rabbi Low to explain the meaning of the ritual that they will see enacted on that day. Rabbi Low tells Joseph that the chalice contains tiny pieces of unleavened bread. They will hear the priest saying, "Brothers, pour out the old leaven that you may be a new dough, as you really are without leaven. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us" (204). When Rabbi Low tells the Golem that, despite these words, Easter is not the Christians' Passover, Rothberg underscores the importance of the marvelous in Holy Communion. Rothberg makes it clear that the fantasy of profanation which so animates the Christians is aggravated by the fact that the Eucharist is understood miracu- lously rather than symbolically as the body and blood of Jesus (204). Thus the evil deeds supposedly inflicted by the Jews on the host become reminders of the Crucifixion, as the Catholics draw a tortured analogy between the supposedly tortured host and the tortured Christ. In the rabbi's words, the Easter celebration prompts the massacres at the close of the novel. And, from the fantasized tortures inflicted on the host emerges the real torture of the Jews (204). In the earlier Passover scene, Rothberg deemphasizes the element of the marvelous in this holiday that readers might erron- eously compare to Easter. Passover as a reenactment of a mirac- ulous event is given less attention than Passover as a symbol of current ethical considerations. First, Rothberg does not want us 168</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen to think of Jews as innately more deserving of God's blessings than anyone else. The assembly reads from Leviticus: "The Stranger that sojourns among you shall be to you as the native and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt" (177). Obviously, the Christians in Prague are not reminded in their ritual to imagine themselves as strangers in Egypt. It cannot be denied that there are lines in the Passover haggadah that do bear witness to a miraculous occurrence for the Jews, since the Angel of Death spared the first-born sons of the Israelites. However, Rothberg directly links a detail of this tradi- tion to the Golem story, again attacking the idea of the Golem as Savior and, by implication, the desire to await a miraculous deliv- erance initiated by God. Rothberg closes the Passover description with Joseph realizing that "he was the slaughterer to be slaugh- tered; he knew the Rabbi Low was his Angel of Death" (177-78). He would be the agent of the Lord's vengeance on the rabbi. This vengeance is provoked not only by the rabbi's spiritual failings but by his desire for miraculous intervention. The destruction of the Angel of Death in the drama represents the restoration of the community to the normal world where reason and ethical thinking must hold sway. Earlier, Rabbi Low's defense of Judaism at the disputation staged to humiliate the Jewish community and denigrate their beliefs had introduced this line of thought. Although he first speaks of the Christians' perversion of love and their dearth of charity, Rabbi Low moves quickly to the problems raised by the idea of Jesus as Savior: If my people did crucify Jesus and Jesus willed his crucifixion, then we have only obeyed his desire and helped him perform the miracle of his crucifixion and resurrection that you hold so dear. What cause is there then for hating and persecuting us for it thereafter? (117). The rabbi indicates one of the problems discussed by René Girard in The Scapegoat regarding the nature of sacrifice in Christianity. If, according to Rabbi Low, God has killed his Son, the Crucifixion becomes morally objectionable: God rather than violent humans would be responsible for murder. A similar argument is made by Girard: the Crucifixion should be seen as the murder of an inno- cent mortal by violent people. This view allows us to escape from the system of sacrificial violence that sanctions murder by project- 169</page><page sequence="8">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic ing the desire for victims onto God's nature. Rothberg indicates that logically the Jews can be guilty of nothing if the crucifixion is really a cosmic drama initiated by God rather than a human event. Rothberg's attack on the Messiah of Roman times extends by implication to any future Messiah. Although the rabbi's question pertains only ostensibly to a murdered Messiah, the close of the novel, with its statement that humans will "forever" be morally weak, suggests that Rothberg believes that an actual Messiah defies logic and should not be awaited. Rothberg's antipathy to anthropomorphic thinking about God is reflected in his two references to Moses Maimonides. The first one occurs in the midst of Rabbi Low's defense at the religious debate: Your praise of love and faith alone as redeeming leads to the deprecation of reason and free will, to superstition and an un- healthy desire for the miraculous, and finally, to blind faith, the Credo quia impossibile. In spite of our own Maimonides, we believe that life is a mysterious process in which God performs acts which man's mind can never comprehend or explain, so that we are not without faith. But we are convinced that reason is the voice of God in man, part of the tzelem Elohim, the image of God in man....(127) This statement is meant as a defense of the rationalist Moses Maimonides (1 135-1205), author of the one great work of Jewish medieval philosophy to have entered the Western tradition, The Guide for the Perplexed, written in Arabic and completed in Egypt c. 1190. Isadore Twersky writes that, although religious rational- ism did not begin with Maimonides, it came to be totally identified with him (23). Subsequent Jewish intellectual history is sometimes seen as a debate concerning the merits of Maimonides' system, and this debate still continues, especially with respect to the nature of God. Furthermore, key issues in Maimonides' work have been interpre- ted very differently. For example, although Norbert Samuelson (1969) has argued that Maimonides believed that God was un- knowable, Shubert Spero (1973) rejects this view. What Rothberg thinks of Maimonides' philosophy can only be inferred. There is probably not a one hundred percent correlation between Maimonides' rationalism and Rothberg's. Instead, we perceive the novelist as working within the tradition of Maimonides, further liberalized by Spinoza- who studied Maimonides - and twenti- 170</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen eth-century philosophy (Bratton, 139). The second historical reference may be unfamiliar to a non- Jewish audience. Rabbi Low compares the burning of the Talmud in the time of Rudolph II with earlier book burnings of Jewish texts in the thirteenth century: Remember, they have burned our books before, but have not succeeded in wiping them from the scrolls of our memories. And shamefully we have burned our own books. Did we not burn the great Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed, and were we able thereby to extirpate it from our hearts? (141). The Guide for the Perplexed [Moreh Nebuchim ] was burned in Montpellier in 1232, twenty-eight years after this philosophical work was translated into Hebrew at the time of Maimonides' death. This event took place eight years before the burning of the Talmud in Paris. The world of The Sword of the Golem has inherited this thirteenth-century tradition of Talmud burnings, as well as that of the formal public disputations initiated by persecut- ing Christians to expose the so-called lies and blasphemies of the Jews. According to Daniel Jeremy Silver in his Maimonidean Criti- cism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180-1240, "the burning of the Moreh was the opening scene of a tragedy in religious relationships" (17). Unfortunately, division within the Jewish community over Maimonides had played into the hands of the Catholic Church. The Vatican had been increasing its persecu- tions of Jews since the papacy of Innocent III, which was also the period of the liquidation of the Albigensian heresy. Rabbi Solomon of Montpellier found the rationalism of Maimonides dangerous to Judaism, and he was instrumental in persuading the local authorities to ban the Guide. The Council of Sens and the Papal Legate had declared that anyone caught read- ing Aristotle would be excommunicated. Therefore, when Rabbi Solomon declared the Guide to be entirely Aristotelian in spirit, he was able to persuade the authorities to burn as many copies as they could find (Bratton, 130). In some areas the animosity toward Maimonides' ideas was so great that a schism within Judaism seemed imminent (Bratton, 130). What had so upset some readers of the Guide ? Are they ideas that in one form or another still disturb some Jews today as well? Silver uses the Spanish anti-Maimonidean poet, Meshullam ben 171</page><page sequence="10">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic Solomon, to represent the opposition. Silver enumerates the accusations. First, Maimonides undervalued the Biblical com- mandments, ignoring their important role in Jewish life. Second, he questioned the reality of judgment, future reward, and divine punishment. Third, Maimonides denied God's relevance by deny- ing His attributes. Fourth, he reduced prophecy to a vision, one seen only dimly. Fifth, Maimonides denied the power of angelic beings and spirits on earth (189-74). In short, Meshullam believed that logic errs if it reaches conclusions that depart from those founded on faith. Maimonides upheld reason and left no room for a Jewish Tertullian. Undoubtedly, Maimonides depersonalized God, but instead of crushing Judaism, Rothberg would argue that his philosophy played a great role in accentuating its spiritual quality. Despite the enormous influence of The Guide for the Perplexed, it did not completely dominate the centuries before Spinoza. Instead, Kabbalism, mysticism, and Hasidic thought occupied the more mystical and non-rationalist side of the Jewish experience. When we hear Rabbi Low appeal to Maimonides, we should not assume that Rothberg is indicating that Rabbi Low believes that God is unknowable. Rabbi Low's lament is more an indication of despair over what should or should not be done to the Jews' persecutors than a question about the knowability of God. It indicates the enormous difficulty of using reason to weigh positive alternative actions in desperate circumstances. Maimonides is relevant to The Sword of the Golem with respect to the Messiah and God's intervention in the world. Maimonides never abandoned the idea of the coming of the Messiah, but his philosophy minimizes eschatology. According to Jacob S. Minkin in The Teachings of Maimonides, "The Messiah, says Maimonides, will be a mortal human being who will die and will be succeeded by his son who will reign after him. He will excel in wisdom and learning and the fear of God" (398). The Messianic Age will be realized in this world, which will continue on its normal course except that Israel will once again be free from political domination (399). The Messiah will not have to perform wonders, such as reviving the dead (400). The laws of nature will not be suspended, nor will there be new natural creations. This Messianic Age is similar to Rothberg's "time of the Golem": neither is the end of 172</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen the world. Kenneth Seeskin investigates Maimonides' attitude toward miracles, particularly with reference to his reflections on Aristotle's theory that in the world everything happens by neces- sity. According to Seeksin, Maimonides does not maintain that the existence of miracles disproves the Aristotelian worldview. A miracle might actually be a dream or part of the natural order (Seeskin, 48; Guide, 2.29). One of the messages of the Guide that Rothberg believes has not been eliminated from the hearts of the Jews is the rational skepticism toward miraculous events which takes our minds off human action. Seeskin's reference to the Guide 2.29 leads us to a passage in which Maimonides (338) discusses Isaiah 13:10-13 where disrup- tions of the heavens are shown to result from God's anger. The cosmic changes are all attributed to figurative expressions. Maimonides states that when a calamity befalls a person, it seems as if the light of the sun and the moon had been extinguished. The visual spirit is disturbed. Seeskin sees in this interpretive strategy a defense of reason in general. The Sword of the Golem also indicates that relying on reason is more important than obeying the Law or following ritual, for it is only through reason that a specific political situation can be addressed and only through reason that violent and non-violent strategies can be evaluated. When Rabbi Low declares that "we are not without faith" (127), he can still be said to be working within the philosophical tradition of Maimonides since he is trying to be attentive to the claims of both faith and reason. As Joseph A. Buijs writes, Rather than either subjugating faith to reason or reason to faith, Maimonides puts them on an equal footing. Apparent conflict between them arises only as a result of difficulties of interpreta- tion; in respect of truth., they converge (Guide, 1:33, 71; Buijs 457). As Rabbi Low states, "reason is the voice of God in man" (127). It also takes a philosopher to determine what to do with the golem, Joseph. When Rabbi Low decides to destroy Joseph, we are again entitled to view this act in terms of the relationship of reason to the miraculous, even though the novel does not specifically ac- knowledge it in these terms. Joseph has killed three Jews and 173</page><page sequence="12">Sword of the Golem Journal of the Fantastic wounded six others, including Isaac, a very fine man who was like a son to the rabbi (227). Rabbi Low specifically informs his wife, Pearl, that he will have to destroy Joseph, since "the law and the community require justice" (227). No mention is made here of one of the key concepts developed throughout the novel, namely the fact that human weakness and evil preclude any other outcome than the creation of a creature who would commit sinful acts. The final scene, however, shows that reliance on the Law to sustain the community is not Rothberg's message. Rabbi Low asks God to forgive him, the Jewish community, and the Golem. Fur- thermore, he tells the frightened Joseph that there is nothing to fear. After the Golem is destroyed, Rabbi Low refuses to turn Joseph into a moral example; instead he says that as a "stranger and sojourner, he has gone away" (231). The destruction of Joseph affirms Maimonides' thought, since it asks us to de-anthro- pomorphize God. Paradoxically, although created to be other, Joseph becomes almost indistinguishable from humans through his actions. Gershom Scholem points out that, in the Kabbalistic view of golem-making, one of the inherent dangers in this act concerned possible idolatry and/or polytheistic confusion (181). Rothberg inscribes himself within this tradition through his invocation of Maimonides' rationalism, for he suggests that the Golem can replace the invisible God as the source of hope for the Jewish community. Oliver Leaman sees as one of Maimonides' major contributions to religious philosophy the belief that "no positive attributes can be predicated on God" (18). In other words, God does not have the type of qualities we might wish to believe in. Maimonides was confronting the question of the problem of talk- ing about God without falling into the Scylla of Superman imagery and the Charybdis of the unspeakable Other (19). Maimonides writes in the Guide, I shall not say that he who affirms that God, may He be exalted, has positive attributes either falls short of apprehending Him or is an associator or has an apprehension of Him that is different from what He really is, but I shall say that he has abolished his belief in the existence of the deity without being aware of it (1:60, 145). Probably the major problem in the apprehension of God is the fact 174</page><page sequence="13">in the Arts Peter G. Christensen that we often attribute a body to Him, and indeed Maimonides himself does speak of Moses' interaction with God in anthropo- morphic terms, which has caused debate as to what Maimonides does believe. According to Leaman, Maimonides permits the observation of the Law, but it should not represent a "valid analysis of the essence of the deity" (36). As noted, Rabbi Low's reference to Maimonides is uttered in his defense of Judaism against Christianity in the public debate. His accusation against Christianity is supported by the fact that the Christians do indeed act on the basis of unnatural superstitions and hatreds, particularly with regard to the notion of blood libel and its assumptions about the Eucharist. The destruction of the Golem indicates that Judaism in its purist form must also resist the temptation to live in the world of divine intervention rather than the world of reason. In conclusion, we have deemphasized Goldsmith's Freudian view of Rothberg's novel because such a reading tends to bypass epistemological questions about the nature of the miraculous for the sake of strictly psychological issues. One should recall Tobin Siebers' assertion that Todorov too hastily jumped to the conclu- sion that in the twentieth century "psychoanalysis replaces the fantastic" (184). Joseph is primarily rejected not as the creature of the id but as the exemplar of the marvelous. References Bratton, Fred Gladstone. Maimonides: Medieval Modernist. Boston: Beacon, 1967.
