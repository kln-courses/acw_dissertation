In Book 3 the narrative reaches the stage of Augustine's life where he joins the Manichees. The description of the encounter presented here, however, is much more than the communication of information on this crucial stage in his spiri tual journey. The passage is generally described as strongly anti-Manichaean, but I argue that the argumentative and emotional tone of the passage combined with the amount of space spent on a few core aspects of Manichaeism make the passage an effective protreptic directed at a specific category of 'Manichaean' readers. Keywords Confessions, Manichaean, anti-Manichaean, reader, protreptic. My research over the last number of years has entailed a careful unraveling of one thread of meaning in a rich multi-dimensional text that no modern reader can hope to understand too easily. 'The one thread of meaning I fol low derives from a reading of the Confessions in terms of its protreptic aims' l) See my Augustine's Confessions. Communicative Purpose and Audience (Leiden and Boston 2004). To date no comprehensive study of protreptic has seen the light. My insights at this stage derive largely from the work of K. Gaiser, Protreptik undPar?nese bei Platon: Untersu chungen zur Form des Platonischen Dialogs (Stuttgart 1959); M.D. Jordan, Ancient Philo sophie Protreptic and the Problem of Persuasive Genres, Rhetorica 4 (1986) 309-333; idem, The Protreptic Structure of the 'Summa Contra Gentiles,' Thomist 50 (1986) 173-209; S.R.

Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 and the extent to which it targets a Manichaean reader.2 I am convinced that an investigation of these issues can contribute to our appreciation of the Confessions. An important section of the article is devoted to the term "Manichaean audience" and an elucidation of the kinds of audience it may imply. Tradi tionally the main intended audience of the Confessions is assumed to be the spiritually advanced servi dei,3 readers similar to the mature narrator of the Confessions and not to the character (the young Augustine) depicted there. Of course, I do not deny that people like the servi dei are also part of its implied audience. Furthermore, the Manichaean audience I refer to should by no means be understood as a one-dimensional group. Although I can not spell this out every time I refer to Augustine's potential reader, I would like the reader of this article to keep in mind from the outset that the potential readership I envisage for the Confessions does comprise a broad spectrum (even though this spectrum is probably present within a small elite): from the servi dei to recently converted Catholic Christians, Catho lics under constant pressure from Manichaean proselytizing, recently con verted or not totally convinced Manichees, and probably a number of not so committed Manichaean auditors.4 Commentary (Leiden 1994); idem, Protreptic in Ancient Theories of Philosophical Litera ture in Greek Literary Theory After Aristotle.

Slings (Cambridge 1999). 2) I work on the assumption that the nature of a text presupposes a specific kind of reader. See for example Rimmon-Kenan, Narrative Fiction. Contemporary Poetics (London 1991), 117-118: "On the one hand [the text] 'selects' its appropriate reader, through its specific linguistic code, its style, the 'encyclopaedia it implicitly presupposes... just as the text pre shapes a certain competence to be brought by the reader from the outside, so in the course of reading, it develops in the reader a specific competence needed to come to grips with it... The reader is thus both an image of a certain competence brought to the text and a structuring of such a competence within the text." 3) See for example P. Brown, Augustine of Hippo. A Biography (Berkeley 2000) 153. 4) I argue that the proliferation of "lives" in the 4th century or, for example, the seemingly wide popularity of a work such as the VitaAntonii may be taken as an indication that inter est in, or mere curiosity about, the lives of others was a prevalent phenomenon and some thing which would have motivated a wide readership to read the "confessions" of someone like Augustine. Some remarks in the Confessions seem to indicate an assumption on Augus tine's side that this kind of curiosity would have motivated some to read it. See my discus sion in Augustine's Confessions 203-207 (above n. 1).</page><page sequence="3">Anti-Manichaean'Passage in Confessions 3 189 I have explicated my reasons for postulating a Manichaean implied audience for the Confessions on a number of occasions elsewhere.5 The present article analyzes one of the passages I have not adduced before as part of my arguments for reading the Confessions as a protreptic to a potential Manichaean audience. This is the well-known central section of Book 3, where the autobiographical narrative relates Augustine's 'fall into' Man ichaeism. The passage is one of the most strongly anti-Manichaean in the work, and thus exactly the kind that one might assume would have repelled rather than exhorted a potential Manichaean reader.6 An investigation into the intended audience of the Confessions has to start with a consideration of some aspects concerning the communicative purpose of the work, one that I have argued elsewhere is at least partly protreptic, for it is clear that the question, "What does the Confessions aim to communicate?" is inextricably intertwined with the question "With whom does it aim to communicate?" About the proposition that the Con fessions is a Christian protreptic there seems to be some consensus.7 I have argued, however, that the term "protreptic" should be coupled with its counterpart "paraenetic" in a designation of the communicative purpose of the Confessions. The two terms-protreptic and paraenetic-have been employed imprecisely and interchangeably from the outset and the reason for this is obvious: in practice protreptic, aimed at winning over those still outside the fold, can never really be separated from paraenetic, aimed at encouraging and retaining those who are already part of the group.

What I present is meant as but one perspective to stand alongside others. 7) See, for example, C.

Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 postulation of a protreptic-paraenetic purpose in the Confessions allows for an audience both of outsiders (like the Manichees or the Neo-Platonists) and of insiders (like the servi dei or the spiritales but also other, less advanced, members of the Catholic congregation in Hippo and elsewhere, as I sug gest below). Furthermore, I argue that certain aspects of the religious milieu where the Confessions originated also contribute to support my proposition. In late ancient North Africa there was probably an ongoing dialogue between Donatists, Catholics and Manichees, or people adhering quite passionately to Neo-Platonism or more traditional versions of pagan religion. And what is more, this dialogue took place against the background of a religious-philosophical milieu characterized by a spirit of competitiveness as Cameron and others have pointed out-and where, in all probability, Catholic Christians were a minority.8 In this time and place the individual was presented, or even confronted, with competing ideologies (philosoph ical or religious) and taking part in heated discussions, making choices, and finding new allegiances may have been a common occurrence, at least in certain circles.9 This kind of context makes it, to my mind, more likely that protreptic-paraenetic intention might be a widespread phenomenon in the philosophical and religious literature of the period, but this is the subject of another article. To return to the purpose of the Confessions: even the more expansive "protreptic-paraenetic" does not-in my view-do full justice to the com municative purpose of Augustine's exceptional composition. The work also has polemical, apologetic and didactic aims.'0 The point is that all these terms imply a communicative purpose that goes beyond providing infor mation about an extraordinary life to similarly minded brethren.

In fact, Augustine tells us that they did.1' But the present article is an attempt to illustrate why the presentation of information to an audience on the same spiritual level as Augustine himself might not be the only or the most important aim of the passage under consideration. An important question to consider at the outset is whether Manichaean readers-apart from Secundinus12-would have read the Confessions and especially whether they would have stomached the harsh polemical and anti-Manichaean sentiment discernible in many passages and then simply kept on reading. In what follows I try to illustrate why I judge that these passages may, nevertheless, have more to say to a potential 'Manichaean' reader, or what we may call a 'marginal Manichee,' than to the spiritually advanced Catholic. The first sentence of Confessions 3.6.10 puts into circulation some of the key terms that will be used to characterize, negatively, the Manichees throughout the work (superbe, delirantes, carnales, loquaces, and laquei diaboli are key terms to denote Manichees and Manichaean vices).'3 This passage also explains the attraction Manichaeism held for Augus tine: it contained the name of Christ (syllabarum nominis tui et domini Iesu Christi), which the Hortensius for all its elegant Latin and captivating ideas had lacked. But in its conglomeration of negative descriptions it is pure invective. It is exactly the kind of passage to fuel arguments that the n) Confessionum mearum libri tredecim et de malis et de bonis meis deum laudant iustum et bonum...

Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 presentation of Manichaeism in the Confessions is too negative to imagine a Manichaean audience. It does not seem at first sight to be designed as a serious effort to reach out to the potential Manichaean reader, as I have argued the meditation on Psalm 4 in Book 9-by contrast-definitely is.14 But at this stage it is necessary to consider more precisely what kind of reader may be envisaged by the term "Manichaean reader." If one were to picture a dour member of the Elect going primly about his business of free ing particles of the divine through his crucial digestive processes (as Augus tine so sarcastically depicts him doing at the end of this anti-Manichaean section in 3.10.18), I would be the first to agree that this Manichaean reader would be so offended by this passage that he would read no further. But there is also an opposite side of the spectrum, the kind of Manichaean reader who, I argue, may well have read and have been deeply influenced by the Confessions, and specifically the passage under scrutiny here. This reader is a young man like Augustine some years earlier, or like the friend whose death Augustine describes so poignantly (and, of course, not incidentally) in the next book of the Confessions.'5 This young 'Manichee' has been searching for nothing less than the proper direction for his life. He may have a leaning towards religion because of his upbringing; he has considered the Catholic version of Christianity or perhaps his family is Donatist. But recently the Manichees have struck a chord with their intel lectual approach and through their criticism of aspects of the Old Testament and of an anthropomorphic concept of God that he too finds troubling. He has been introduced (perhaps by someone very much like Augustine) into a warm and welcoming circle of bright young men like himself, Man ichaean auditors, and he has found the ideas and the company equally stimulating. To repeat what I have said above: a less concise, but more precise, term to describe such a reader would be "marginal Manichee." This kind of potential "Manichaean reader," I argue, would approach these same words in a totally different frame of mind (from the member of the Elect). He might not be offended by Augustine's presentation. He is conceivably more open to conviction, for he is a critical young man who makes his own decisions, one of the fashionable intellectual elite in a sophisticated city such as Carthage.

The anti-Manichaean element here might have a protreptic effect on such a reader. This probability is corroborated, in my view, by the contents as well as the tone and texture of the section under discussion. The retrospective presentation at the beginning of 3.6.10 (haec nomina non recedebant de ore eorum up to libris multis et ingentibus) of the spuriousness and futility of what the young Augustine found in Manichaeism is interspersed with a clear echo of his emotional sighing, at that stage, for truth, for the name of God, for God himself, a "hunger" that might parallel that of our marginal Manichee.16 The formulation creates a tension between the passionate desire for truth, on the one hand (embodied in the emotional tenor created by the repetition of veritas et veritas; the intimate vocative in mipater summe bone, pulchritudo pulchrorum omnium; and the almost erotic wording of medul lae animi mei suspirabant tibi), and on the other hand, the copious (see the repetition of verbs for talking, dicebant, multum eam dicebant, loquebantur, dicentes, sonarentfrequenter et multipliciter) but deeply inadequate nature of that which was offered in response (expressed by tenus sono et strepitu linguae, cor inane veri, nusquam erat, falsa, voce sola). The fact that the whole is presented as an intimate, prayed version of Augustine's own expe rience, and not a haughty condemnation from a distance, makes it con ceivably a strong appeal to someone like the young Manichaean auditor. At this stage I want to elaborate on another dimension of the potential reader postulated for the Confessions in this article. For this reader the anti Manichaean content of the work may be even more relevant than for a 16) haec nomina non recedebant de ore eorum, sed tenus sono et strepitu linguae; ceterum cor inane veri, et dicebant: veritas et veritas, et multum earn dicebant mihi, et nusquam erat in eis, sed falsa loquebantur non de te tantum, qui vere veritas es, sed etiam de istis elementis mundi,... o veritas, veritas, quam intime etiam turn medullae animi mei suspirabant tibi, cum te i?li sonarent mihi frequenter et multipliciter, voce sola, et libris multis et ingentibus (These names did not recede from their mouths, but it was mere sound and the wagging of a tongue; for the rest their hearts were devoid of truth.

Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 young Manichaean auditor. This person is a member of Augustine's (or a similar) congregation, not always so well versed in all the intricacies of interpretation that distinguishes his group from the others. But he is accosted regularly by Manichaean proselytizers who throw trick questions at him that he is often unable to answer. He is not one of the spiritually advanced. He is in dire need of the affirmation, the support and the instruc tion that I argue is exactly what the following sections of Book 3 offer. It is vital to keep in mind that this kind of reader represents an integral part of what is meant in this article by the phrases "potential Manichaean audi ence" or "marginal Manichee." The last section of 3.6.10 (illa erantfercula, in quibus mihi esurienti te inferebatur pro te sol et luna up to the end of 3.6.10), too long to quote in full here, is a piece of rather long-winded rhetoric designed to discredit Manichaean beliefs about the divine nature of the sun and the moon through stating repetitively that the celestial bodies are not God,17 but only part of His creation (and not even the most important part at that), and that to believe in their divine character is like eating insubstantial ghost-food."8 The length of this passage (27 lines in O'Donnell's text) is significant, because it is exactly its length and wordiness (still combined with a strongly emotional tone) that constitute one of the grounds for my argument that it aims at an objective beyond narrating the fact of Augustine's involve ment with Manichaeism and the contents of Manichaean error to a group of like-minded servi dei. Like the beginning of the passage, this section, which employs a sustained culinary metaphor, generates a tension between the emptiness experienced and a desperate hunger for God. This is achieved by the intermingling and juxtaposing of words expressing desire or hunger with words depicting emptiness or lack of substance. Thus we have esurie bam (I was constantly hungry), sitiebam, (I remained thirsty) and nec nutriebar, exhauriebar magis (I was not fed, rather I became more empty) on the one hand, and phrases such as phantasmata splendida (shining ghost images), figmenta inania (empty fictions), corporalia phantasmata (object like ghost images),falsa corpora (false objects), inanibus (emptiness), phan 17) See for example J. van Oort, Manichaeism and anti-Manichaeism 243 (above n. 13) on Manichaean beliefs that particles of the divine literally migrated to the sun and the moon. 18) The emphasis on God as creator is of course part of an ongoing larger argument against Manichaean teaching about creation and their arguments against the creation story in Genesis.</page><page sequence="9">Anti-Manichaean'Passage in Confessions 3 195 tasmatis corporum (ghost images of objects) and phantasiae corporum (fantasies of objects) on the other.19 Augustine's insistence on not being satisfied with some substitute, but on finding (or tasting) the true God himself (veritas) heightens the contrast between desire and emptiness. He repeats: opera tua, non tu; te ipsam... esuriebam et sitiebam; nec sapiebas in ore meo sicut es; similia erant ullo modo tibi, sicut nunc mihi locuta es (the insistence on the personal pronoun and the vocative, tu amor meus lend poignancy to his resolve). Most effective, however, is the hierarchy of realities Augustine creates through a set of comparisons (quibus certiora... rursus certius... quanto longe es... quibus certiores sunt... et eis certiora), where the Manichaean concept of the divine nature of the sun and the moon is successfully pushed to the remotest and most insubstantial edge of the spectrum. What would readers from the circle of the servi dei, the group many scholars still believe is the real intended audience of the Confessions, gain from reading this passage? There are a number of possibilities: information on Manichaean beliefs, affirmation of the fact that their beliefs are superior to those of the Manichees, identification with Augustine's sighing for God, insight into how Augustine came to realize that Manichaeism was an error. But it must be clear that this passage would be especially effective in com municating with the young Manichee or the embattled Catholic postu lated earlier. It is a repetitive, emotive first-person narrative, bolstered by imagery based on one of man's most basic needs, that of sustenance,20 repetitively and compellingly arguing that Manichaean theology and cos mology are missing the point. What it presents, constitutes, in my view, a highly effective argument for turning a newly-converted Manichee away 19) For a very creative rendition of the various phrases quoted here, see the translation by M. Boulding, The Confessions (London 1997), who succeeds excellently, in my opinion, in recreating the tone and texture of the passage. 20) The culinary metaphors used here and throughout the Confessions must have evoked, if only on a subliminal level, the central role of the eating ritual in the daily liturgy of the Manichees. They probably reflect Augustine's past Manichaean preoccupations and may even be designed to elicit stronger reaction from such readers. See also the analyses of this passage by J. van Oort, Augustinus' Confessiones. Gnostische en christelijke spiritualiteit in een diepzinnig document (Turnhout 2002) 11-18, who argues that the culinary imagery is employed here specifically to evoke the Manichaean eating ritual; and D. Shanzer, Narra tive Patterns, Allegorical Choices, and Literary Unity in Augustine's Confessions, Vigiliae Christianae 46 (1992) 40-56, who sees the polarization between Manichaean ghost-food and the true food of God as one of the key features of this passage.</page><page sequence="10">196 A. Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 from Manichaean beliefs (and probably also some valuable affirmation for the not-so-advanced Catholic). Much of the next paragraph (3.6.11) constitutes biting invective against Manichaean ideas. The "fables of the grammar teachers and the poets" (grammaticorum et poetarum fabellae), i.e. classical literature (already dis credited as worthless earlier in the Confessions)21 are now presented as worth much more than Manichaean cosmology. In a perpetuation of the culinary metaphor and taking up again the allusions to the prodigal son,22 Augus tine likens the encounter with a flying Medea (classical literature reduced to the absurd instance) to eating husks (those that the prodigal son fed to the pigs), while implying that Manichaean cosmology left him totally without sustenance, to the point of leaving him to die (quinque elementa... occidunt credentem).23 The rhetorical point is that classical literature is less harmful because the reader does not really believe that Medea flew (etsi cantari audiebam, non credebam) while the stories of Manichaean cosmol ogy were equally fanciful but adherents were supposed to believe them literally, as the young Augustine had done (illa autem credidi). Thus the effectiveness, or vindictiveness, with which foolish Manichaean belief is discredited is counterbalanced and made more palatable by the confession that the speaker himself had first also fallen into the trap of believing such things. Ihis is once again a passage too abusive for a committed Manichee to wade through and then cheerfully persist in reading the Confessions. (It would be reasonable, though, to assume that some of these readers may have scrutinized such passages in order to be able to refute them.) But the other readers we have imagined might be seduced by Augustine's rhetoric to the point of assenting to it or finding in it a retort ("believing x is like believing that Medea really flew"), effective exactly because of its trite nature, with which to defend against or to attack a Manichaean opponent. The insistence on the errors of Manichaean thinking and, once again, the amount of space spent on this make more sense to me when the Confessions is read as a protreptic trying to convert marginal Manichees (back) to 21) E.g. in Conf. 1.13.21 or 3.2.2-4. 22) See G.N. Knauer's definitive article, Peregrinatio Animae (zur Frage der Einheit der augustinischten Konfessiones), Hermes 85 (1957) 216-248, on the central role of allusion to the story of the prodigal son in the Confessions. 23) See also J. van Oort, Augustinus Confessiones 16-17, on the reference to pigs in Conf 3.6.11 (above note 20).</page><page sequence="11">Anti-Manichaean'Passage in Confessions 3 197 Catholicism, instead of viewed simply as providing information about a conversion, relevant most of all to the servi dei. The strongest support for my arguments lies in the fact that this passage is followed by an even longer section which constitutes a defense of the Old Testament against Manichaean objections (the last and longest part of the segment under discussion, 3.7.12-3.10.18, 132 lines in O'Donnell's text, just under two and a half pages). Perhaps this kind of defense has relevance for the servi dei and the spiritales as an example of how criticisms against the Old Testament may be demolished, and as a paraenetic affirmation of what they believe. In my view, once again, the length and the nature of the passage make it more eminently suitable as a protreptic paraenetic discourse aimed at one like the young Manichee or the less advanced Catholic, proving to them that certain dangerous-sounding crit icisms of the Old Testament are in fact unfounded. Chapters 3.7.12 to 3.10.18 are rhetorically marked as a unit (including a 'digression' onflagitia andfacinora in 3.8.15 to 3.9.17) by the profession of ignorance repeated at the start of each chapter (except the chapters that form part of the digression): nesciebam (3.7.12), et non noveram (3.7.13), haec ego tunc nesciebam (3.7.14), and haec ego nesciens (3.10.18). Chapter 3.7.12 starts once again with a very negative characterization of the Manichees in the phrase stultis deceptoribus (stupid deceivers) followed by two of the stock questions Manichees troubled Catholics with: the question about the origin of evil: unde malum? and the objections to an anthropomorphic perception of God utrumforma corporea deusfiniretur, et haberet capillos et ungues? (is God confined in a corporeal form and does he have hair and nails?). This is followed by a third question which introduces the Manichaean criticism of the Old Testament patriarchs, here in particu lar for their polygamy (qui haberent uxores multas simul), committing mur der (Moses the Egyptian) and sacrificing animals (which to the Manichees may have looked exactly the same as pagan sacrifice). In the rest of 3.7.12 (only a few lines) the first two questions are answered briefly, each answer introduced with non noveram. Both these questions are worked out more fully in the rest of Books 4 to 7. (Surely it is significant that these are ques tions that originated with the Manichees and that they direct the argument of this large section of the Confessions.) Within chapter 3.7.13 the strategic placing of the words nesciebam, non noveram, non noveram, and ignorabam at the end, neatly delineates the different segments of the argument. The next six chapters of Book 3 (3.7.13 to 3.10.18, by far the longest part of this Manichaean section in Book 3)</page><page sequence="12">198 A. Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 are dedicated to answering the third question (with the 'digression' serving the purpose of further illuminating the issue under discussion).24 In other words, they become an extended refutatio of Manichaean objections to the Old Testament, inter alia by suggesting that the problems disappear when scripture is interpreted correctly, i.e. allegorically.25 I argue that the passage makes most sense when read as a persuasive piece of didactic writing, a highly effective protreptic to the young Manichee or a paraenetic sermon to the uncertain member of the Catholic congregation (rejection of or adherence to Catholicism or Manichaeism must have hinged to a significant degree on the rejection or acceptance of the Old Testament). What we have here (in chapters 3.7.13 to 3.10.18) is textbook rhetoric at its best, as the introduction of this section in 3.7.13 illustrates with its "conventional rhetorical employment of the three similes from everyday life... from the [military] camp to the forum to a private household."26 The point of the similes and the section as a whole is to illustrate how natural it is that many things are allowed at certain times and places but not at others. Thus the mores of the Old Testament patriarchs are presented as valid for them in their era, even though they are not acceptable to Chris tians of the present era. In the last part of 3.7.13 Augustine ascribes the inability to understand this to a lack of historical perspective.27 24) The contents of the digression may be summed up as follows: some kinds of transgres sions are always condemned by all people everywhere; some kinds present less clear-cut cases, which may be seen as sins or not; other kinds of transgressions may even be found reprehensible by men but not by God and God has the ultimate authority on what is allowed when and where. I will leave it to the theologians to analyze Augustine's ideas on sin: the rhetorical function of the digression is clearly to support the argument in defence of the Old Testament patriarchs, by illustrating?like the similes from everyday life?that the fact that they adhered to different mores in a different era is a kind of circumstance that has many precedents and is no grounds on which to reject the Old Testament. 25) See J.J.

The spiritually advanced servi dei and the spiritales might savor the rhetorical prowess of the passage and be instructed by Augustine's views onflagitia andfacinora, as are theologians today. But the argumenta tive nature of the prose and the amount of space allotted to the issue seem to me to endorse my view that it is designed to argue with a Manichaean reader. I conclude with some final remarks on the audience I envisage for the Confessions. At the time when Augustine wrote this work there may have been cherished friends of this man-for whom many agree that friendship was all important28-who were still Manichees, perhaps even friends whom he himself had introduced to Manichaeism. My argument that he may have felt a particular burden of responsibility to free such people from the error of Manichaeism, as he now saw it, is based to a large extent on my analysis (presented in another article)29 of the meditation on Ps 4 in Book 9 of the Confessions. This passage betrays strong emotion and the utmost frustration at the inability to break through to such Manichaean readers. But we also know about three historical figures that may constitute the type of reader targeted by the Confessions, even though it cannot be proven that any of these persons were implicit addressees. Augustine introduced his patron and friend Romanianus to Manichaeism and his Contra Aca demicos and De vera religione constitute explicit efforts to bring him over to Catholicism. But Romanianus is thought to have converted to Catholi cism in 396,3? whereas most scholars put the date of the commencement of the Confessions only after 397. Still, the fact that someone so close to Augustine remained in the grip of Manichaeism for so long after he had become convinced of its erroneous nature must have weighed heavily on him and may have been one of the issues shaping the writing of the Confes sions. Then there are two Manichees whom we know as addressees of works different situations]). See Augustine's views on this issue also in De doctrina Christiana 3.18.26-3.19.28. 28) However, J J. O'Donnell's evaluation of Augustine's relationship with friends seems less confident about Augustine's ability to maintain strong friendships, especially after he became bishop of Hippo, Augustine.

Kotze / Vigiliae Christianae 62 (2008) 187-200 that may be called anti-Manichaean, one pre-dating the Confessions and one post-dating it: Honoratus, the addressee of the De utilitate credendi (probably written in 391), and Secundinus, addressed in the Contra Secundinum Manicheum (probably written after 404 and also concerning, amongst other things, the issue of the defensibility of the Old Testament).31 Both of these may at least serve as examples of the type of reader or Man ichaean hearer that may have read the Confessions.32 This literature also constitutes proof of the burden felt (or least professed) and the effort expended by those on both sides to save those on the opposite side from what they saw as erroneous belief Lastly, it is quite conceivable that there were others, like the friend whose death is described in Book 4, whose names we do not know but whose dalliance with error was nevertheless an equally great concern to Augustine. I remain convinced that it is to this kind of audience that the passage analyzed here would speak most effectively. 31) For the dating of these works see for example F. von Fleteren, De Utilitate Credendi and J.K. Coyle, Contra Secundinum Manicheum, in Augustine through the Ages.
