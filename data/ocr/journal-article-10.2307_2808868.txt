Williams, S.J. Boston College Press, Chestnut Hill, Mass. $1.00. 9-} x 6-}; 5 6; 1939 (paper). This monograph presents, in a scholarly fashion, the different phases through which the theories on the origin of life and the process of organic evolution have passed since their inclusion into the realm of human thought. The present trend is held to be away from the practice of considering Darwinism and evolution as synonymous, and away from the hope of ever obtaining the environmental condi- tions necessary for the spontaneous gen- eration, or the re-creation, of life. Dar- win's theory of the origin of the species by means of natural selection is said to be only a small portion of the whole theory of evolution, inasmuch as it does not account for the origin of life or the diver- gence of forms down to the species. His theory of natural selection, or survival of the fittest, is attacked on the grounds that no scientific evidence is yet available which indicates that the fittest do survive, or conversely, that those which survive are the fittest. The thesis is closed with praise for Darwin's theory for the stimulus it furnished for further investigation in evolution, but with severe criticism for the dogmatic persistence of some scientists in clinging to popular authority without the necessary scientific evidence to support such a stand. The volume is concluded by a long list of bibliographic references. LEXICON OF GEOLOGIC NAMES OF THE UNITED, STATES (INCLUDING ALASKA). (Also includes the names and ages, but not the definitions, of the named geologic units of Canada, Mexico, the West Indies, Central America, and Hawaii). Part 1, A-L; Part 2, M-Z. U. S. Department of the Interior. Geological Survey. Bulletin 896. Compiled by M. Grace Wilmarth. Gov- ernment Printing Office, Washington, D. C. $2.50 for the two volumes. 9~ x 5-~; 2395; 1938 (paper). This lexicon, compiled as a "time saver for the busy geologist" will be a valuable addition to any biological library and particularly to those where ecology and paleontology are special subjects. The definitions state, briefly, the lithology, thickness, age, underlying and overlying formations, and type locality. In order to avoid undesirable duplication of names, and to supply information frequently sought, the names, geographic areas, and ages of the principal underground geologic units have been listed; also the names and geographic regions of Pleistocene moraines, with a reference to the publication in which an outline or a description of each will be found. The names of coal beds and ore beds have not been listed. The time terms have also been listed, but the full definitions of the era, system, and series terms having been given in United States Geological Survey Bulletin 769, 1925, only very brief definitions of them are given here, with a reference to Bulletin 769. Stratigraphic charts "against which the definitions, redefinitions and geographic distribution of the units could be checked" have been prepared. They do not accom- pany the lexicon but we gather that they may be obtained from the U. S. Geological Survey.</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 465 GENETICS ORIENTAMENTI DELLA MODERNA BIOLOGIA. Micromerismo od Organicismo? Mutaoionismo o Lamarckismo? By Mario F. Canella. Nicola Zanichelli Editore, Bologna. IS Lire. 93 x 7; I4I; 1939 (paper). In accordance with some of the philo- sophical views held by Bertalanffy, and accepting Raffaele's criticism of the gene theory, the author takes issue with the mutation theory of organic evolution. His arguments cover all the essential postulates of modern genetic theory. To begin with he is far from convinced about the characteristics and functions generally attributed to the genes and justifies his opinion by pointing out inconsistencies in the dicta of the geneticists themselves. But the author is mainly concerned with the mutation theory and he emphasizes that it implies, among other things, that chance mutations have brought about the transformation of Selachii into amphibia, amphibia into birds and mammals, an- thropoids into Hominidae. In his opinion it is inconceivable, and there is no evidence whatsoever to show, that such a series of evolutionary changes could be the product of chance mutations. Consequently, he notes, mutation could possibly explain only the formation of varieties within the species. If this is so, he continues, it means that we must assume either that species are fixed and accept the existence of a Deity who has ordered the universe or else seek another explanation of evolu- tion. The author believes that one has not far to seek since Lamarck furnishes the needed theoretical approach to the study of organic evolution. As an embryologist he finds in Lamarckism the theory that seems closer in agreement with the facts he has observed, and therefore he pleads for a better understanding of these princi- ples, strongly chiding those who have gone out of their way to heap ridicule on Lamarck. In turn he becomes very sar- castic about the validity of the many experiments made to disprove the inheri- tance of acquired characters, pointing out that as planned they disregard the most important aspects of Lamarck's views. The author demonstrates a profound knowledge of the literature and a philo- sophical ability of no mean value. Al- though not quite convincing he deserves attention as do all who criticize estab- lished dogmas. YOU AND HEREDITY. By Amram Scheinfeld, assisted in the genetic sections by Morton D. Schweitzer. Frederick A. Stokes Co., New York. $3.75. 82 X 54; Xvii + 434 + io plates; I938. It might seem that nothing could be a farther cry from an exact science than fortune telling. Yet You and Heredity looks into the past, examines the present, and foretells the future. It is a genetics book written for the laymnan by a layman (who has read and consulted eminent authorities). In simple terms the mecha- nisms of heredity are revealed, and the significance of these findings in human lives is pointed out, at the same time shattering many age-old superstitions. Forecast tables are issued which enable one to predict future appearances and defects in himself and children on the basis of characteristics noted among ancestors or present relations. Interesting sections tell of the inheri- tance of disease, mental traits, talents, and length of life. The closing chapters contain negative and positive eugenic measures which can be applied by society as a whole and by the individual for the betterment of his own life and the lives of his offspring. By and large the author is careful to state only the facts of heredity and to label any doubtful points. However, he makes a few hidebound statements which have at one time or another exhibited leaks. Chief among these is the allegation that there can be absolutely no inheritance of acquired characters, whereas certain stud- ies suggest the wisdom of less dogmatism on this point. All in all the volume is well written, containing a good index and a selection of useful references. L'HYGIENE DE LA RACE. Etude de Biologie He're'ditaire et de Norma-lisation de la Race. By G. Banu. Masson et Cie, Paris;</page><page sequence="3">466 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY M.O., Imprimeriao Nationald, Bucharest. 8o francs. 92 x 64; vii + 403 + I folding chart; I939 (paper). By the term "race hygiene"' the author means the health and welfare of a national or ethnic group. In this volume he out- lines the method of study that in his opinion is most apt to insure further progress in national well-being. As he states it, the main objective of research in race hygiene should be the investigation of all the controllable factors that can modify favorably or unfavorably the mental and physical qualities of future generations. From this statement it is obvious that the author stresses particu- larly the genetic aspect of human biology and in fact the greater part of the book is taken up by a discussion of the inheri- tance of physical and mental traits and the hereditary transmission of disease sus- ceptibility. He notes that much more information is needed in genetics, but nevertheless he is a very strong advocate of the more extreme proposals made off and on by certain eugenists. Numerous aspects of human biology are covered in this book since the author examines the demographic conditions of several coun- tries relative to social hygiene and, in particular, to eugenic measures. The reader will find mentioned here a fair, even though limited, account of the work of European investigators in this field but very little regarding the contributions of American students of the subject. ANGEWANDTE TIERZUCHT auf rassenbio- logischer Grundlage. By Carl Holecek-HolleschowitZ. Verlag voz Julius Springer, Vienna. RM. iL. (paper); RM. I3.50 (cloth). IO x 7; XiV + I76; I939. This excellent treatise is concerned with the origin, development, and present-day methods in the breeding of domesticated animals in Europe. Dr. Holecek-Holle- schowitz presents a description of the early European horse, cow, pig, sheep and goat, together with a summary of the effects of domestication and scientific breeding on the present day forms of these animals. With the advent of genetics as a separate science has come a great advance in the development of specialized types of domestic stock. Pure strains of race- and dray-horses; of beef and milk cows; of wool-and meat-pro- ducing sheep; as well as wool-, meat-, and milk-producing goats have been developed as a result of the trend based on the principle of race biology. With the newer knowledge of animal genetics and animal nutrition, have come attempts to hybridize certain types of domestic animals so as to combine into one animal the valuable qualities of several pure strains, and it is of interest to note that these attempts have not been entirely without success. The volume is illustrated by more than IOO photographs, and contains a 5-page table of contents. LIFE PROCESSES IN GRAY NORWAY RATS DURING FOURTEEN YEARS IN CAPTIVITY. The American Anatomical Alemoirs No. I7. By Helen Dean King. Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia. $z.oo. Io x 68; 72 + X plates; 1939 (paper). Data for the eleventh to twenty-fifth generations are giveni in this second report on the studies of the changes in various life processes that take place in the Rattus norvegicus when bred in captivity for a number of generations (since I9I9). Growth and variability in body weight, the reproductive period, the sex ratio, mortality, and mutations are some of the processes discussed in the text. The report on the first ten generations was published in i92.9. Plates of the hooded and curly mutants are given in the I939 report. The hooded stock was developed by selective breed- ing; the curly mutation (a dominant mu- tation heretofore unknown in rats) was attributed to gene changes occurring in rats long bred in captivity. Other mu- tants are discussed in the text. The late Dr. Donaldson's researches on organ changes in the fifteen generations (II-X.5) will be published later.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 467 THE GENETICS OF GARDEN PLANTS. Sec- ond Edition. By M. B. Crane and W. J. C. Lawrence. With a Foreword by Sir Daniel Hall. The Macmillan Co., New York and London. $3.X5. 82 x 54; xxi + z87; I938. The first edition of this book (cf. Q.R.B., Vol. IO, P. 34X) appeared in I934. Since that time progress in genetics has been so great that many additions and occasional rewritings have been required to bring the subject matter up to date. The additions mainly consist of a discussion of linkage in Zea mays; multiple genes; genetics and cytology of Iris species; a chapter describing the chemical and genetical basis of flower color; a discussion of the genetics of melons; recent results of genetics of incompatibility in diploid and polyploid plants, etc. RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANT GENETICS.

Blakiston's, Son and Co., Philadelphia. $5.50. 7A x 1 54; xii + 4IZ + 8 plates; I939. In this second revision Chapters II, III and X have been extensively rewritten and others have been altered "in order to express the newer viewpoints of geneti- cists." A chapter on variegation and on chimaeras is included and there is a discussion of the more biological aspects of genetics, "since a common misconcep- tion that genetics is a conglomeration of cytological theories, statistical work and peculiar terminology is all too prevalent." GENERAL BIOLOGY CONSERVATION IN THE UNITED STATES. By A. F. Gustafson, H. Ries, C. H. Guise and W. J. Hamilton, Jr. Comstock Pub- lishing Co., Cornell Heights, Ithaca, N. Y. $300. 92 x 62; xi + 445; I939. "It is the aim of this book to present the basic principles of conservation to the reader so that he may gain an understand- ing of tomorrow's problems and be in a position to deal effectively with them." All forms of conservation are con- sidered: soil and water, forest, fish, game, and mineral resources. The authors do not take an alarmist attitude, but rather give a critical evaluation of the state of depletion as it now exists, the problems that confront us, and methods by which we can deal with these problems. Edu- cated individuals, through public coopera- tion and wise use of the vote, may even- tually do mnuch for the cause championed by this volume. A BIOLOGY OF FAMILIAR THINGS. By George L. Bush, Allan Dickie and Ronald C. Runkle. American Book Co., New York. $I.9z. 84 x 54; [6] + 695; I939. Most high school students feel that the reading of any textbook is labor. This volume goes as far as possible in minimiz- ing cut and dried facts, presenting, as it does, material which is of greatest interest to young folks, and demonstrating biologi- cal principles along the way. This is done by showing how biology applies to man in health and sickness and in the keeping of gardens and of household pets. The economic imxortance of plants and animals is stresse , with particular refer- ence to the control of pests and to the problems of conservation. For better than average students numerous assign- ments and experiments are suggested. There are also extensive lists of references. DESERTS. By Gayle Pickwell. Whittlesey House, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.50. II12 X 9; xiv + I74; I939. There is more plant and animal life in a desert than the average person usually suspects. This fact is brought very forci- bly to one's attention by the beautiful photographs that illustrate this book. The author mentions the commoner plants and animals, typical of the deserts of the</page><page sequence="5">468 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Southwest, that spend their lives under rigorous conditions of existence, and explains how they are adapted to meet this struggle. But it is the illustrations that form the backbone of this work, the text being secondary, although interesting and essential. OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND THEIR CONSERVATION. Second Edition. Edited by A. E. Parkins and J. R. Whit- aker. John Wiley and Sons, New York; Chapman and Hall, London. $4.00. 9 x 57; XiV + 647; I939. This volume follows the same plan of the earlier issue (cf. Q.R.B., Vol. iS, No,. z). In this edition, however, the 23 contribu- tors have been able to give greater con- sideration to cross references and to eliminate duplication of material. All statistics have been brought up to date so far as possible. Some chapters have been reworked to fit changing conditions, and a new chapter has been added on the con- servation of commercial fish. The editors point out that the greatest advance in any phase of conservation is in recreation, which involves, of course, hunting and fishing. MANUAL OF BIOLOGY.

II x 81; Part One, ix + I76; Part Two, ix + 2II; I939 (paper). Part One of this laboratory manual con- tains Z4 exercises for the study of protozoa and the plant, and the second part has z5 exercises for metazoan animals. Both parts have sections on the sources of teaching materials and the pronunciation and derivatives of biological terms. The plan for centering the work around organ- isms and types rather than according to principles of biology was the outgrowth of many experiments in teaching large groups of students at Washington Square College, New York University.

This pamphlet represents Part II of the report by the expedition of the McCoy Society for field investigation and re- search, and describes the geology, vegeta- tion, mollusks and fish associated with the Sir Joseph Bank Islands. For the most part, the plant and animal forms are quite similar to those of the neighboring mainland of Australia, and the only new forms described are one genus and eight species of mollusks.

This completes a popular trilogy on ancient life in America. Ancient Life in the American Southwest and Ancient Life in Mexico and Central America are the first two volumes in the series on the American Indian race and its vital place in the cul- tural history of man. Ancient Andean Life is divided into three parts. Part I deals with the history of man as a world-drama and the earth as a stage with the following principal stage settings: (i) desert areas, (X) great river valleys, (3) coast lands and continental islands, (4) intermountain plateaus, and (5) sterile lands with no history. The author makes a distinction between cul- ture and civilization and defines culture as "'the result of man's acceptance of nature as he finds it, . . . -not seeking to become the master, but remaining the child of nature; at one with her in mode of life, in aspiration, in worship-in short, in every phase of existence." A general archaeo- logical picture of the world is given in which the Andean world has its niche. Part II deals with the stage settings of the Andean world and the description and history of the Andean Indians of the present time, Inca time, Pre-Inca time, and remote time. Particularly amusing is the author's treatment of the Jivaro Indians. These Indians have quite a reputation as head-hunters; they also have novel ways of dealing with enemies. The author tells of their method of satis- fying the gold-hunger of a Spanish gover- nor-melted gold was poured down his throat. In Part III (Retrospection and Conclu- sion) the author tells of his experiences of forty years work in. the trenches as a "dirt" archaeologist. It is here that he expresses his opinions on the present study of archaeology to the effect that less academic verbalizing on the part of the professors and more spade archaeology would make for more productive results. The author also writes of the great archaeologists of the nineteenth century whose work kept his own interest aflame. Lastly, he speaks of the aims and values of this science. SHEBA'S DAUGHTERS. Being a Record of Travel in Southern Arabia. By H. St. J. B. Philby. With an Appen- dix on the Rock Inscriptions by A. F. L. Beeston. Methuen and Co., London. 7 is. net. 94 X ; xix + 485 + 47 plates + I folding map; I939. Sheba's Daughters is the account of the author's travels in Southern Arabia. The greater part of his journey lay in the little- known, undemarcated, unexplored terri- tory of South-West Arabia between Sa'udi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate. The author was the first European to enter Abha, the capital of Najran, that much disputed frontier region between Sa'udi Arabia and the Yaman. He was the second European to visit Shabwa, but the first to make a thorough study of this ancient capital city of the Himyarites, its inhabitants, and the famous ruins of the Temple of Astarte. The first European to have visited Shabwa was Hans Helfritz who arrived there late at night and hur- riedly quitted the city in the first hour of daylight escorted by its enraged citizens and a good deal of gunfire. Philby's book represents an enviable record of travels and amazing explorations in South-West Arabia. In addition, the state of unrest among the peoples of that part of Arabia which is south of Sa'udi Arabia is vividly set forth. British im- perial ambitions coupled with the Mus- lim's ingrained love of independence have produced that unrest; the Muslim in South-West Arabia envies the peace of Sa'udi Arabia and wishes for the intervention of Ibn Sa'ud in the South. Especially in Hadhramaut is there an undercurrent of restlessness, and particu- larly here do the people look to the com- ing of the Wahhabi King to help maintain the peace and order which the Muslim people are unable to maintain. At the close of the book there is an ex- cellent detailed map of the author's route. There is also an inset diagram on the same map of the Ruins of Shabwa. Although there is an index to the textual material, unfortunately there is no index to the map which is very detailed and hard at times to follow. There is also an appendix by A. F. L. Beeston on the inscriptions found by the author in his travels. This appen-</page><page sequence="7">470 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY dix is followed by a word-index to the inscriptions.

Dutton and Co., New York. 9o cents. 6' x 44; xv + 326; I93 8. The editor of Everyman's Library.has done an important service in making easily available a considerable part of the most pertinent original documents regarding one of the most remarkable experiences in the history of humankind. To the human biologist there is no facet of the Bounty episode that is not of enormous interest and deep significance. Naturally every- one who has told the story of what hap- pened, from the time it happened down to the present when every schoolboy knows something about it from the movies, has colored his narrative to a greater or smaller degree with the pigments of his prejudices. The present volume gives Bligh's side of the story. And in accom- plishing this it does something more. It makes it possible for us to form in some degree a first-hand independent judgment as to what sort of man Bligh really was. The conclusion seems inescapable that he was not essentially different in kind from the general run of British naval officers of his time. The system deliberately en- couraged pomposity, cruelty, and graft in the officers at the expense of the men. A just conclusion would seem to be that Bligh was no more of a knave than his peers in the service, who were all per- mitted and indeed encouraged to make as much as they could out of the business of victualling and otherwise supplying their ships. But quantitatively he appears to have been vainer, more conceited, and less capable of administering wisely the enormous power over other human beings vested in a naval commander by the system of his time, than the average. Every Bounty-story fan, and they must be legion, will want this volume. THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF SCIENCE. By J. D. Bernal. The Macmillan Co,, New York. $3.50. 84 x 5A; xvi + 482. + L folding charts; I939. The subject of this book is a very broad one. Generally speaking it intends to investigate the relation of science to modern society and the social and eco- nomic developments in our time. Or, as the author, a physicist at the University of London, states in his preface: "This book is an attempt to analyse this connection; to investigate how far scientists, indi- vidually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a de- structive utilization of science." The task is not an easy one and one must ad- mire, at any rate, the enormous amount of material which has been collected by the author in order to give such an analysis in different fields of science and in different countries. There is first an instructive historical chapter, completed somewhat in a later chapter on international science in modern times. It deals with science in the older industrial countries of Europe, in the United States and in the Far East, science and Fascism, and science and Socialism. Perhaps the author overesti- mates somewhat here and elsewhere the development of science and its possibilities in Soviet Russia. Other chapters analyze the present organization of science in schools and universities, the training of the research worker, the efficiency of scientific research with many a criticism; again other parts deal with the applica- tion of science, difficulties in financing re- search, the effect of war preparations on science, scientific communication and the function of scientific publication. These are only some of the points treated in the book. It is well documented. YOUR CITY. By E. L. Thorndike. Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York. $2.oo. 8 x 5X; 204; I939. This book is intended to be a popular exposition of the author's investigation</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 47I on the General Goodness of Life in 3IO communities and its measure or index G. The index G is the composite score of the well-being of a community and is derived from the rank held by the community relative to 37 items selected by the author. Among these items are included infant and typhoid death rates, numbers of telephones and automobiles, per capita expenditure for education and recreation, number of employed children, frequency of pauper- ism, the sale of certain magazines, and similar features about which some quan- titative estimate can be made. The 37 items, given weights according to a criterion not explained here, were summed to arrive at a value of G which therefore appears to be more of a statistical pastiche than is the usual run of such indices. When the 3 IO cities are distributed ac- cording to the value of G the results show that Pasadena, Cal., Montclair, N. J., and Cleveland Heights, Ohio head the list while Columbus, Ga. and Charleston, N. C. are at the foot. The author pro- ceeds then to correlate G with several other communal traits ranging from tax- able wealth to the sex ratio of the population. Incidentally, a number of the traits that the author correlates with G are already incorporated in G while others are im- plicit in some of the items that make up G. In the end, the analysis which certainly involves a tremendous amount of manual labor leads to results that, on the whole, are not very exciting and are pretty ob- vious to the intelligent reader, for whom this book is written. REFUGEES. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 203. Edited by Francis J. Brown. The Ameri- can Academy of Political and Social Science, Philadelphia. $X.50 (cloth); $2.oo (pa- per). 94 X 6x; xv + 2.7I; I939. Many well-known students of the social sciences have contributed to this number of The Annals dedicated to a discussion of the problems related to forced migration from one's country of birth or of residence. The twenty-two articles included here concern four aspects of forced migration: (i) the social elements responsible for the phenomenon; (X) the characteristics of the contemporary groups of political exiles; (3) the types of situations fared by the refugees in the countries to which they have repaired; (4) the means of alleviating the hardships of the refugees. On the whole, the subject is discussed objectively and mostly from the standpoint of the historical forces nvolved in the past and present instances of forced migration. As is to be expected, however, the articles that deal with the German-Jewish migra- tion of today are written in a style cal- culated to arouse further the sympathies of the reader. With such articles excepted, this series is instructive inasmuch as a feeble attempt has been made to examine the question of exiles and refugees from a correct perspective. It may be added that no practical workable solution of the present problem has been advanced. An annotated bibliography of some of the very recent works on the refugee problem is also found in this number. THE RACES OF EUROPE. By Carleton S. Coon. The Macmillan Co., New York. $7.00. 94 x 68; xvi + 739 + 46 plates; I939. This work, prepared to serve as a college textbook of physical anthropology, is concerned with the origins of the peoples of Europe. Moreover, the book has been written to expound an hypothesis. This is that "the present races of Europe are derived from a blend of (A), food-produc- ing peoples from Asia and Africa, of basically Mediterranean form, with (B), the descendants of interglacial and glacial food-gatherers, produced in turn by a blending of basic Homo sapiens, related to the remote ancestor of the Mediterraneans, with some non-sapiens species of general Neanderthaloid form." Such is the basic idea that colors the exposition of the ma- terial. The first six chapters are dedi- cated to a discussion of the skeletal re- mains of man from those of the Pleistocene period to those of the Iron age. The fol-</page><page sequence="9">472 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY lowing chapters are concerned with brief descriptions of the peoples now living in Europe. In general the subject is pre- sented in a lucid if compressed manner. Included in the book are maps, original photographs and an adequate bibliog- raphy. It cannot be said that the author has sufficiently demonstrated his thesis. But it has, however, about as much plausibility as many other of the hypothe- ses that have been advanced on the subject.

HIe made somewhat over ioo drawings and sketches during his travels. Some of these (zo colored plates and 96 vignettes) appeared in his work Travels in the Interior of Sourth Africa, which was published in two volumes in i8722.-24. The Gubbins Trust of Johannes- burg has undertaken the task of publishing groups of drawings, together with the artist's notes, from the remaining collec- tions and here we have the first volume- collotype reproductions (4 colored), mostly of the natives with whom Burchell lived-issued in a very fine limited edi- tion. All but three of the 2.i plates are portraits and were made for the purpose of showing every variety of countenance an( feature . . . some Lsubjects] hav- ing more resemblance to the Guinea Negro, and others, on the contrary, to the Hottentot or Kora, with whom there frequently exists a real con- sanguinity. . . . I was much struck with the little agreement which their proportions have with those of a European head. The relative position or distances of several features, differed often in a most remarkable degree; and the head of Mollemml would set all the rules of the art at defiance. In his colored sketches the artist obtained the exact shades by preparing a kind of paint from sibilo, "a shining, powdery iron-ore of a steel-grey qr blueish lustre" with which the natives smeared them- selves. SIBERIAN MAN AND MAMMOTH. By E. W. PfiZenmayer. Translated from the German by Muriel D. Simpson. Blackie and Son, London and Glasgow. i2.s. 6d. net. 81 x x; Xii + 256 + Z4 plates + I folding map; I939. This absorbing volume is an account of the author's two journeys into the far northeast section of Siberia. The expedi- tions were sponsored by the Russian Academy of Science and were made for the purpose of discovering and studying the frozen remains of the early Siberian mam- moth, with nearly all the soft parts well preserved. These journeys took the au- thor and his party through hitherto little known areas of the waste lands of northern Siberia, and the accounts of meeting with the inhabitants, and the study of their social and economic activities are quite as interesting as the description of the mam- moth finds themselves. Two mammoths were studied in situ, and as far as possible, salvaged for further investigation. In addition to the study of the men and mam- moths of this strange country, the author has included a discussion of the pertinent features of the climate, natural history, and the physical character of the terrain. The work is well illustrated, completely indexed, and is concluded by Appendices I: The mammoth of Great Lyakhov Island; and II: The elks of North East Siberia. SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY. A Study of the Demographic and Economic Background of Education in the State of New York. By Julius B. Maller. The Regents' In- quiry, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.50. 84 x 54; xiii + 360; I938. "The primary aim of this study is to throw light on the relationship between the cost and the character of education in the various communities of New York State and to portray the demographic and socio- economic background of these communi-</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 473 ties." To this end a great many statis- tical and demographic data are given in the single chapters which deal with dynamics of population, school popula- tion, characteristics of the population such as density, occupational pattern, un- employment. Other chapters take into account social factors, economic back- ground and many other things that have a bearing upon educational policy. The material is carefully selected and gives much useful information from different points of view. In the chapter on- social factors, for instance, valuable data are presented on crime and delinquency, cul- tural factors such as illiteracy, library facilities and magazine circulation, as well as data on health conditions and general and specific death rates in different com- munities. Several appendix chapters give in greater detail tabulated data for the single communities. MY DAYS OF STRENGTH. An American Woman Doctor's Forty Years in China. By Anne Walter Fearn. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $3.00. 8' x 53 xiii + 297 + I5 plates; I939. Dr. Fearn belonged to the earliest crop of medical women in this country. Born in the deep South with an ancestry of aristo- cratic attitudes, she got her medical educa- tion only over sharp family opposition. Soon after taking the M.D. degree a wholly unforeseen set of circumstances sent her out to China. She intended to stay only a year or so. Actually she stayed until a short time before her death, which occurred soon after this volume came off the press. She was a woman of remarkable intelli- gence and executive ability, as well as a wise and skilful physician. These quali- ties, coupled with unusual charm and social savoir faire, combined to make a career as notable for its material success and the joys of living that it included as for the well-doing that made it blessed by the hosts of Chinese and Europeans she healed and helped. She married a devout missionary, but herself could always take her religion or leave it alone. Her priv- ate hospital in Shanghai (the Fearn Sana- torium) appears to have been about as famous for its cocktails as for its medical services. A notable book by a remarkable woman. SEVEN LEAN YEARS. By T. J. Woofter, Jr., and Ellen Winston. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, N. C. $I.5O. 88 x 52; xi + I87 + i6 plates; I939. This book deals primarily with rural problems during the years of the depres- sion from I93I through I937. The au- thors have had access to a wealth of ma- terial concerning the distress of the rural classes which are bearing the burden of rearing and educating 3I per cent of the nation's children with only 9 per cent of the nation's income. The improvement of rural life has been contin- uously agitated for many years. Country life com- missions date back to the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, and farm aid has been the subject of countless investigations and organizations. Through- out this process the activities of the federal govern- ment in behalf of the farmer have increased, taking the form first of educational and advisory aid, then of the development of magnificent scientific bureaus and the extension service of the Department of Agriculture (p. 4). However, not until the depression was the attention of the nation focused upon the importance of the rural situation. The single chapters give consideration to the manifold problems of the human elements involved as well as to the material side in terms of production and price structure. RACE AGAINST MAN. By Herbert J. Seligmann. Introduction by Franz, Boas. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York. $X.75. 82x 51;xii+z48; I939. To the multitude of books which have ap- peared in the past five years propounding the folly of race definition another has been added. The author explains the im- possibility inherent in any attempt to de- Ene race; traces man from his earliest progenitors; believes heredity to be a mat- ter of fate; upholds the hybrid as an asset to the world in both the animal and</page><page sequence="11">474 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY human spheres; shows that every type of man has been responsible for some measure of the world's ethical development; and finally blesses America for being the world's true melting pot. The volume, at first glance, seems to present its wealth of material in an unbiased manner, yet, on close surveillance, it is possible to detect an undercurrent of emotional distrust of the social and political trends of the Nazi and Fascist regimes in Europe. Or, to put the matter less delicately, realism compels us to say that this book is essentially counter-propaganda. THE MENOMINI INDIANS OF WISCONSIN. A Study of Three Centuries of Cultural Contact and Change. Memoirs of the American Phil- osophical Society. Volume X, 1939. By Felix M. Keesing. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia. $2. 50. 94 X 6; xi + z6i + 8 plates; 1939 (paper). The author, in this monograph on the processes of cultural change, presents his research material covering three centuries (i634-I9z9) of cultural contact and change in the Menomini. The Menomini are one of the Central Algonquian tribes and as such represent "one sub-group within a great common area of culture and language found throughout the forest lands of the eastern and central parts of the United States and Canada." This monograph consists mainly of a survey of the eth- nological and historical data concerning Menomini-white interaction during three centuries; the data are supplemented by the author's field investigations during a stay of over four months in the reservation community of the Menomini to observe the process of change as represented by the contemporary scene. The author intends to visit the reserva- tion again in order to bring fully up to date his study of contemporary life. This further study is made necessary in view of the adoption of the Indian Reorganization Act which aims at Indianization rather than assimilation. GEORGIAN PORTRAITS. By Percy Colson. Williams and Norgate, London. 8s. 6d. net. 8 x 5-; )69 + IS plates; 1939. Eleven biographical essays about persons prominent in the British scene, followed at the end by an autobiographical self- portrait. The subject of each essay is in- troduced by some one other than the author. Only three of the subjects have any particular relations with science: Sir James Jeans-and Colson is rather more interested in Jeans's musical talents and activities than in his science; H. G. Wells; and the Bishop of Birmingham, Dr. Barnes. The book is entertaining. The author's prose has great beauty and charm. He does not like Mr. Wells much-says his intelligence is "slick and superficial"-and gives him a thorough, if urbane, lambasting. The attitude to- wards men, events, and things is through- out a bit on the wistful side. The world is no longer as nice a place as it once was before the advent of "our ugly, modern, soi-disant civilization." But the dissatis- faction is never bitter. "To everything," says Colson, "there is a season-a time to be born and a time to die. I have had a good innings, and I have not the faintest desire to make my century." LIFE'S JOURNEY THROUGH TIME. An Ap- proach to Some Problems of Human Biology. By Alex. S. Gillespie. Pen-in-Hand Pub- lishing Co., Oxford. 5s. net. 74 x 52; 2.56 + 4 plates + I foldinlg table; 1938. In this book the author attempts to give schoolboys "something leading up to the biology of mankind," although the book is "especially concerned with population, war, and social problems." But isn't that rather too comprehensive for any volume of zoo-odd pages, and isn't it asking a good deal of the understanding of almost any schoolboy or girl? The book is divided into eight chapters, the first five of which discuss briefly the position of earth in space and the rise and spread of vertebrates culminating in the emergence of man and his rational mind. Chapter VI (pages I3I to i82) takes man</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 475 from the New Stone Age to the present. The two concluding chapters are "espe- cially concerned with . . . social prob- lems," for example, unemployment. There is a list of references for each chapter. HOUSING REQUIREMENTS OF FARM FAMI- LIES IN THE UNITED STATES. U. S. De- pairtment of Agriculture. Miscellaneous Pub- licaition No. 322. By Maiud Wilson. Government Printing Office, Waoshington. io cents. 9'8 X 54; 39; I939 (paper). This is a usetul report suggesting desirable features of comfort in farmhouses. It is based on opinions and facts sent in by many farm homemakers and deals with a good many constructive ideas toward better housing conditions. "Recent stud- ies of farm housing indicate that only a small proportion of rural families in the United States live in houses that have most of the features desirable for family life.'" Some main points of the contents may give a better insight of the material treated: general requirements of farm- houses, construction and orientation, en- trance protection, heating, sanitary facili- ties, storage facilities, provisions for child care, etc. The regional variations in housing requirements of farm families are treate in a special chapter describing the main differences in I4 regions of the United States.

Following a general discussion on the Nguni tribes, two sub-groups, Xhosa and Thembu pictorially presented in 40 excel- lent plates, are considered culturally and historically in two separate brief reports. There is a large bibliography on the Xhosa and Thembu which is divided into the following two sections: (i) history, eth- nography, and modern conditions and problems, and (X) language and literature. Photographic studies of other Nguni tribes will appear in future sections. RASSENKUNDE UND RASSENGESCHICHTE DER MENSCHHEIT. Zweite umgeairbeitete und erweiterte Auflaige in zwei Bcrnden.

A Com- parative Study of Man and His Animal Allies. Revised Edition. By Herbert E. Walter. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.oo. 8- x 54; xxv + 88X; I939. In this revision of Vertebrate Zoology, which appeared in i920 and has had considerable usefulness for supplementary reading in comparative anatomy courses, it was necessary to produce an almost entirely new book in order to incorporate certain changes desired by the author. As it now stands, the book presents the subject matter of the lecture part of a course in comparative anatomy (the laboratory work, dealing with comparative anatomy, system by system, is independent of the lecture course) with considerable addi- tional matter for supplementary reading. The lectures cover the whole Phylum Chordata, with emphasis upon the evolu- tionary history of the group, the interrela- tions of surviving groups, general prin- ciples illustrated by the group, and sig- nificant aspects of their natural history. The volume is illustrated by 2.35 figures and is well indexed. The second of these excellent texts first appeared in i928 (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. 3, No. 3). Since that time eleven reprint- ings have been made. It now appears in revised form and entirely rewritten. Ninety-three pages have been added and something over 8o illustrations, so that there are now 736 figures. An excellent index is provided. ELEPHANTS IN AFRICA. By Frank Melland. Introduction by The Right Hon. The Earl of Onslow. Country Life, Ltd., London; Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $3.75. 8- x 5-; Xiii + i86; I938. A careful and rather critical book about African elephants by an intelligent sports- man who has had a large amount of first- hand experience with them in the field. This is a book that every mammalogist will want to add to his library. The first five chapters deal with matters of be- havior in general, and in particular with such things as mutual aid, seen in the other members of the herd helping a wounded comrade to escape. Chapters VI and VII deal with family life, breeding, childhood and adolescence. Two chap- ters (XII and XIII) are devoted to domesti- cation, an important problem in Africa, on which real progress is being made. Other chapters are devoted to such topics as diet, control to prevent damage to crops etc., the degree of intelligence to be im- puted to the elephant, native relations to elephants, and the much discussed mystery of sickness and death. On all these topics what the author has to say is re- strained and sensible, great care being taken to make plain the distinction be- tween what he knows of his own knowl- edge and what he has heard or read. Twelve full-page drawings by Stuart Tresilian add greatly to the charm of the book. There is a thorough index. THE CHILDREN OF TANE. Bird Life in New Zealaznd. By Monai Gordon. J. M. Dent aind Sons, London; Whitcombe aind Tombs, Christ- church, N. Z. ios. 6d. net. 81 x 51; xii + 250 + 8 plates; 1938. This book gives the history of bird life in New Zealand, from the time that Aotea- roa was a country covered by virgin timber until the present day when modern civili- zation has, as usual, completely altered the topography of the island and as a con- sequence has appreciably affected the bird life. Many of Tane's children have dis- appeared or have become scarce. Fortu- nately sanctuaries have been instituted for the protection of some of the rare and unique species. These refuges are all de- scribed in detail. Tieke, Tauhou, Ko- kako, Titipounamu, the Kiwi, and the Huia are some of the birds about which the author relates interesting facts con- cerning their habits. As may be gathered from the native names, the book is filled</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 477 with Maori bird mythology and also with much material on the Maoris themselves. There is an index, a few color illustrations of birds, some photographs of the island, and a list of the scientific names of the birds mentioned in the book. PHYSIOLOGICAL GROUP DIFFERENTIATION IN LYMNAEA COLUMELLA. The American Journal of Hygiene Monographic Series, No. 14. By Joshua L. Baily, Jr. With a Fore- word by Raymond Pearl. The Johns Hop- kins Press, Baltimore. $i.OO. 9 x 5x; X + I33 + 2 folding tables + 2 plates; I939. Baily reports the results of an investiga- tion on Lymnaea columella Say, the object of the inquiry being "to disclose the pos- sibility of physiological races which were morphologically indistinguishable." He gathered two samples of snails, one from Centennial Lake, Fairmount Park, Penn- sylvania and the other from a pond at Dumbarton, Maryland. These snails were bred under laboratory conditions and the longevity, mortality rate and fertility of the progeny were observed. The results of the investigation show that while the two groups of snails could not be dif- ferentiated morphologically yet they pre- sented striking and significant differences relative to the physiological variables studied. The laboratory technique em- ployed in this investigation is described in detail and the observations, also clearly presented, are accompanied by a brief but penetrating discussion regarding subspe- ciation and the formation of geographical races. BATS. By Glover M. Allen. Harvard University Press, Cambridge. $4.00. 9 x 6; x + 368 + 30 plates; I939. There has long been a need for a good book about bats. Now we have it, and from the pen of a master. Allen has done a superb job, from both a literary as well as a scientific point of view. The bats are worthy of great biological respect for two primary reasons. They existed as "per- fectly good" bats, not possibly to be mis- taken for anything else, 2Lo-2Ls million years ago in Eocene times. They repre- sented then, as now, one of the most re- markable of all the adaptive divergences ever achieved by those remarkably adapt- able creatures, the mammals. The book is truly comprehensive. In its 2i chapters every aspect of the subject that arouses curiosity is authoritatively discussed. It is extensively and intelli- gently illustrated. It includes a bibliog- raphy of I4 pages. Altogether we can- not recommend this treatise too highly. It simply must be in every biological library. BETWEEN PACIFIC TIDES. An Account of the Habits and Habitats of Some Five Hundred of the Common, Conspicuous Seashore Invertebrates of the Pacific Coast Between Sitka, Alaska, and Northern Mexico. By Edward F. Ricketts and Jack Calvin. Stanford University Press, Stanford Uni- versity, Cal.; Oxford University Press, London. $6.oo. 9 x 6'; xxii + 32.0 + 46 plates; I939. The fascinating life of a seashore loses some of its complexity as one reads this lively account of what two scientists found along the Pacific Coast without the aid of even a pocket magnifying glass. Com- mon names are used as much as possible to supplement the Latin ones, and descrip- tions of forms and habitats are in non- technical language. The many photo- graphs and line drawings are a help to anyone wanting to identify his "catch." About 5oo common invertebrates of the west coast between Sitka, Alaska, and northern Mexico are discussed. The ma- terial is organized in such a way that the collector can run down his specimen from knowledge of its habitat alone, after all the easiest way for the beginner. An ap- pendix gives references for the reader who wishes to go deeper into the field. A LABORATORY INTRODUCTION TO ANIMAL ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY.

This laboratory course offers an extremely interesting and stimulating introductory plan of study of natural history for field and laboratory work. Preceding the exer- cises there is a comprehensive introductory discussion on the interrelationship of ani- mals with their environment. The main part of the book is given over to exercises which have been so arranged that they involve field work, identification of field forms, observation and experiment, and reading and reflection. There are two synoptic keys-one to phyla and the other to classes and orders. These are followed by a glossary of the technical terms used in the keys. At the end of each exercise there is a list of suggested reading. There is also a separate alphabetically arranged bibliographical section. There are two indexes-taxonomic and subject. THE RECENT MAMMALS OF IDAHO. By William B. Davis. The Caxton Print- ers, Caldwell, Idaho. $s.oo. 9 x 6; 400; I939. This handsome volume describes the I4I different kinds of mammals to be found in Idaho. In addition to the account of species, there are chapters on the geog- raphy of the state, floral provinces, prob- lems of distribution, and other matter pertinent to an understanding of the mam- malian fauna with respect to its distribu- tion, evolution, etc. The author has made a few systematic changes and de- scribed several new forms that will be of interest to the taxonomists. There are keys and distributional maps, a bibliog- raphy and an index. Also much material on life histories is given. So, all in all, this book represents a compendium of knowledge concerning mammals of this state and the surrounding territory. An altogether notable book. ZOOLOGICA.

The title of this book might give the im- pression that a comparison is made be- tween man and ants but actually one finds very little of it. Instead, the book con- tains a delightful description, somewhat anthropomorphic in tone, of the social activities and probable social evolution of numerous genera of ants. Under such sug- gestive chapter headings as "Fascism or Communism?", "War," ' "Slavery," etc., the author limits himself in general to an account of certain aspects of the organiza- tion of ant society with but innocuous excursions into the parallels to be noted in human society.

In this book is given, briefly, the essential information concerning all household pests, both animal and plant, that plague the British housewife. For each pest, the material has been arranged under headings (habits, life history, harm done, prevention, eradication, etc.), and is ac- companied by excellent black and white figures which show various stages in life history. Simple remedies for eradication as well as what to use in serious infesta- tions are always given. An excellent list of references accompanies the description of each pest and the volume concludes with a glossary and an index. BuscHi: Vom Orang-Saugling zum Backen- wulster. By Gustav Brandes.

This is the life history of Buschi, an orang-outang who grew from infancy to adulthood under the care and observation of Professor Brandes, former Director of the Dresden Zoological Gardens and famous authority on anthropoid apes. In addition to his research on the mor- phological and physiological develop- ment of orang-outangs and on the question of the connection between the human race and the highest anthropoid apes in the light of his researches, the author has presented a story which, though basically scientific in nature, will appeal to all animal lovers.

The author has written this book for the specific purpose of introducing the varied plant life of the United States to its citizens-the backyard gardeners, the win- dowbox gardeners, the countless com- munity garden club members, the travel- ers, the college students who though familiar with microscopic work as pre- sented in botany courses are unable to identify plant forms in the plant world about them, and the -ologists ad infinitum who see the whole of the plant world only in terms of their own specialities. There is, in the United States, an assortment of plant life equalled by few other countries.... Because of the almost riotous abandon of American topography, from the mountains of the far west to the eastern coastal swamps, and from the flat mid- western plains to the desert basins of the southwest, there is every conceivable type of habitat with its own peculiar forms of plant life. Although this book is a source of de- tailed information on the life of almost every common plant, both native and naturalized in this country, it is neither confusing nor tiresome to read. The author has followed a simple classification and has omitted as much as possible of the scientific terminology with which text books are so painfully swamped. In addition there are over 400 excellent photographs and line drawings. There are two appendixes: The first is a detailed check list of species arranged by phyla, classes, orders and families with both common and scientific names given. Appendix II is a reference list of general literature, manuals and identifi- cation books, and books dealing with more detailed aspects of plant life-(these latter are correlated with the chapters). There is also a large and complete index. INTRODUCTION TO THE BOTANY OF FIELD CROPS. South African Agricultural Series, Vol. I6. Vol. 1., Cereals; Vol. 11., Non- Cereals. By J. M. Hector. Central News Agency, Ltd., Johannesburg; Gordon and Gotch, London. ?3. ios. net. 9' x 6-; Vol. I. xi + 478 + xxxiv; Vol. II. vii + 479- II27 + xxxiii; [I938?]. Two important volumes for the student of botany, but more especially for the ad- vanced worker in agronomy. The work is to be regarded as an "introduction" to this rapidly growing subject, bringing together a large amount of material, much of which can only be found in widely scattered sources. In spite of the size of the work, its scope is in breadth rather</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 481 than in detail. Nevertheless all the im- portant phases in genetical analyses, cytology, physiology, etc., for each form are thoroughly discussed and wherever necessary details are included. "Crop ecology," a subject which the author feels is too vague at present for generali- zation, has been omitted. The term 'field crops' is here used in a particulate sense: inclusively to incorporate all plants cultivated in the 'field,' i.e., on arable land; exclusively to omit the plants of the garden, the orchard, the grove and the plantation. The distinction, however, is not absotute, since all 'cultivated' grasses are omitted and certain plants, such as cotton-regarded in certain areas as a 'plantation crop'-are included. In the first volume the chapters are on the Gramineae-oat species (Avena), wheat species (Triticum), rye, barley, rice, millets, saccharum-the sugar canes -sorghums, and maize. The second vol- ume is on the Liliaceae-onions and aspar- agus; the Moraceae-hemp and hops; the Polygonaceae-buckwheat family; the Chenopodiaceae-beet family; the Cruci- ferae; the Leguminosae; the Linaceae- flax; the Malvaceae-cottons; the Umbel- liferae; the Convolvulaceae-sweet po- tato; the Solanaceae-potato, tomato, tobacco; the Cucurbitaceae; and the Com- positae. SHEEP AND TURNIPS: Being the Life and Times of Arthur Young, F.R.S. By Amelia Defries. With a Preface by R. A. Butler and an Introduction by Montague Fordham. Methuen and Co., London. 7S. 6d. net. 74 x 54; Xviii + 2.35; I938. England's "Second Agrarian Revolution" of the late i8th and early igth centuries laid the foundation for the England of well-tilled farms and fine livestock of today. Prominent among the men who did the spade-work of actual experimenta- tion in agricultural methods and who helped formulate some of the legislation that encouraged good farming was Arthur Young, first Secretary to the Board of Agriculture. His interest, however, was not confined solely to agriculture. The broader aspects of a population's compo- sition and the relation of the rural-urban ratio to a nation's prosperity also claimed his attention. He was a strong advocate of a census, publishing a paper in I770 entitled Proposals for Numbering the People. His papers, and' the journal of his travels through England and France, are sources for much of the material here, to which the author has added a brief but compre- hensive sketch of the background of England's agrarian revolutions. The pres- ent biography gives a well-rounded picture of this pre-Malthusian thinker, sometimes called "the father of modern agriculture." WONDER PLANTS AND PLANT WONDERS. By A. Hyatt Verrill. D. Appleton-Century Company, New York and London. $3.00. 8 x 2; Xiii + 2.96 + i6 plates; I939. A popularization that stresses the absolute necessity of plant life for the existence of all life on the earth, and describes the plant wonders used for food, clothing, shelter, beverages and other commodities, together with the plant giants, plant dwarfs, and other plant curios throughout the world. The reader is led on with the often repeated comment that curious as this plant may be, or valuable as that plant may be, the one about to be de- scribed is even more curious or more valuable than the preceding one. The long bow is sometimes stretched to the breaking point. The statement that bacteria spores ". . . germinate and produce more bacteria even after being frozen in liquid air at a temperature of over four thousand degrees below zero ..." seems to overlook the fact that absolute zero is usually thought by physicists to be at 2q73 below zero Centi- grade (-459'F.). Journalistic science at not quite its highest level is about the right price tag for this volume. BACTERIA the Smallest of Living Organisms. By Ferdinarnd Cohn. Translated by Charles S. Dolley. Introduction by Morris C. Leikind. The Johns Hopkins Press, Balti- more. $i.oO. IO x 7; 44; I939. It was indeed commendable to re-edit this</page><page sequence="19">482 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY classical paper that takes an important place in the history of bacteriology. It was originally published in i872 and as early as i88i an English translation was made by Charles S. Dolley, then a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania, who had studied for some years abroad and at once recognized the importance of the paper. This edition of his translation has not been changed, except for the cor- rection of some misspelled names, but the present editor has added to the text a fine introduction on the life of the original author as well as of the early translator. When Ferdinand Cohn published his essay in i877 entitled Ueber die Bacterien, die kleinsten lebenden Wesen, Koch was still an unknown physician. The history of bacteriology, writes the new editor, has been written largely by medical men and the emphasis on the role of the bacteria as agents of disease has caused their importance in the life cycle to be for- gotten. For this reason Cohn's paper is of importance since no one before or after him has so brilliantly and clearly indi- cated the position of bacteria in the general economy of nature. THE GARDEN oF LARKSPURS. With Deco- rations. By L. H. Bailey. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.0. 9x 68; viii + iI6; I939. An important book for those interested in breeding and hybridizing larkspur. It belongs in the series which Dr. Bailey started sometime ago with The Garden of Gourds and followed up with The Garden of Pinks. Information is given concerning soil, drainage, fertilizing and mulching, and location of beds necessary for the suc- cessful cultivation of larkspur. Aside from sections on the breeding and culture of delphinium, a key to significant species, and descriptions of species and varieties (II3 varieties of 76 species), special atten- tion is given to the following larkspur groups: Rocket, Forking, Bouquet, Gar- land, Candle and Red. Leon H. Leonian contributes a chapter on diseases of delphinium and W. E. Blauvelt on insects and other pests. There are also 2.3 black and white draw- ings in the text, a frontispiece and end- piece in color, and a useful index. FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. A New Outlook with special reference to the Interpretation of the Gynaeceum. Volume Two with additional illustrations and Index for Volume I. By E. R. Saunders. W. Heifer and Sons, Cambridge. ios. 6d. net. 74 x 5; xiv + 609 + vii; I939. Continuing the scheme begun in volume one (see review in Q. R. B. vol. I3, no. I), the author discusses i5i additional fami- lies of flowering plants, again placing his emphasis on the relation of the vascu- lar ground-plan to the floral ground-plan, and the importance of keeping this in mind when dealing with problems of floral morphology. There are many il- lustrations. An index covering both vol- umes is included. An appendix contains a reproduction of the author's exhibit at a recent British Association for the Advancement of Sci- ence meeting. Under the title A Century's Challenge to Orthodoxy he presents a survey of the course taken by a point of view (the structural nature of the gynaeceum) which has been contrary to the traditional one. His citations extend from i82.3 to I92.3. THE GROWTH AND NUTRITION OF WHITE PINE (PINCUS STROBUS L.) SEEDLINGS IN CULTURES WITH VARYING NITROGEN, PHOS- PHORUS, POTASSIUM AND CALCIUM: with observations on the Relation of Seed Weight to Seedling Yield. The Black Rock Forest Bulletin No. 9. By Harold L. Mitchell. The Black Rock Forest, Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. $i.5o. 9 X 6; vi + I35; I939 (paper). This report, including 2.7 tables and 2.2. figures, gives in great detail the experi- mental procedure and results obtained in carefully controlled cultural experiments in white pine seedlings. Seedlings grown in properly balanced nutrient-sand cultures are far superior, as regards total weight, balance between root and shoot and, to a lesser degree,</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 483 root development, than the average nursery-grown seedling of the same age.... The results of chemical analyses revealed an exceedingly high degree of corre- lation between the internal (seedling) content of N, P, K and Ca, expressed either as milligrams . . . or per cent of dry weight . . , and the external (solution) concentration of these elements. These experiments were repeated in a series of field studies where all the nutrient elements, varied in the cultural experi- ments, were also varied individually and in several combinations. Only the more pertinent data from the field studies, how- ever, are included in this report-in the section dealing with certain fundamental relationships. EXPERIMENTS IN PLANT PHYSIOLOGY. A Laboratory Textbook. By Walter E. Loomis and Charles A. Shbll. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $z.oo. 9 x 6; xiv + I3; I939. This excellent laboratory manual is a revision of a portion of the authors' Methods in Plant Physiology, and is pre- pared especially for the use of beginning students. The problems are developed around the broad physiological processes in plants (growth, respiration, transpira- tion, photosynthesis, etc.), and are of such a variety as to meet the needs of numerous types of classes and courses. The manual does not supplement any particular text book, but rather gives a list of references for each of the chapter headings, as well as a list of general questions for each experiment. The volume is well illustrated, both graphically and photographically, and contains a table of contents, a complete index, and an appendix listing numerous chemical solutions, formulae, prepara- tions, and apparatus needed in the plant physiology laboratory. ELEMENTS OF PLANT PATHOLOGY. By Irving E. Meihus and George C. Kent. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.00. 88 X 58; x + 493; I939. In the writing of this elementary text three points were kept in mind: (I) many students have no intention of becoming professional plant pathologists but take the course as an aid to their work as farmers, teachers, or agriculturists, (z) the time allotted to the subject must be brief-not more than five hours for one quarter or four hours for one semester, (3) the availability of appropriate subject matter in sufficiently concise form. Em- phasis is placed on parasitism in disease processes and the principles relating to control measures, coupled with the con- densation and omission of unnecessary morphological and mycological data. The volume is abundantly and well illustrated (z59 figures) and contains a glossary, a list of 75 books dealing with some phase of plant pathology and a useful index. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ANNUAL PRE- CIPITATION AND THE YIELD OF SPRING WHEAT IN THE GREAT PLAINS. U. S. Department of Agriculture. Technical Bul- letin No. 636. By John S. Cole. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. 5 cents. 94 x 54; 40; I938 (paper). Data covering a total of 387 crop years at I9 field stations in the Great Plains are given of precipitation for the year ended July 3I and three indexes of yield of spring wheat. The primary study is made with an index of the average yields of about 30 plots repre- senting low-, medium-, and high-yielding mnethods. Less detailed studies are made with the average yields of continuously cropped plots, a low-yieldin, method, and an average of yields on fallowed land, a high- yielding method. The statistical data are arranged in z8 tables. PLANT BIOLOGY. An Outline of the Princi- ples Underlying Plant Activity and Struc- ture. Third Edition. By H. Godwin. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. T$2 *p5. 72 x -x + 308; I939. The Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London have combined "in the in- terests of schools, to make uniform the scope of teaching for the biology of their respective Ist M. B. examinations." For this reason, in the 3rd edition (the book</page><page sequence="21">484 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY was at first intended mainly for first year medical students) there have been addi- tions in certain sections and new chapters on the fern plant, and reproduction by means of the flower and the formation of seeds. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CUMULATIVE SOLAR RADIATION AND THE DRY WEIGHT INCREASE OF NURSERY-GROWN WHITE PINE AND RED PINE SEEDLINGS. Black Rock Forest Papers, Vol. I, No. 13. By H. L. Mitchell and R. 0. Rosendahl. Black Rock Forest, Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. ii x 82; 87-94; I939 (paper).

Masson et Cie., Paris. 2.5o francs. io x 62; I938 (paper). This work embodies the results of three years of investigation on the development of the central nervous system in the human embryo. The first part is devoted to a detailed description of the nervous system of each of the 5z embryos, ranging in age from I8 to 252 days; the second, to a study of each region of the human nervous system in its development from the begin- ning to the end of pre-natal life. Some 32o excellent photographic illustrations have been included to supplement the text. No figure is included which is not thor- oughly described; and likewise, no major point of interest is discussed in the text without the use of a photograph as a special aid. M. Barbe, in giving a general plan of development for the human nervous sys- tenm, has given particular and detailed attention to the cerebral vesicles during the first month of intra-uterine life; to the lateral and median ventricles; to the development of the choroid plexus; to the formation of the anterior and posterior hypophesis; to the trapezoid area of His; to the cranial nerves (particularly the hypoglossal); and the spinal ganglia. The author gives a description of the primitive neural tube, and with the aid of several excellent figures, shows its two distinct (cephalic and spinal) portions. The cerebral region is quickly transformed into five divisions, or cerebral vesicles, which, Barbe finds, do not always develop along a longitudinal axis, but may follow three other distinct and separate patterns; namely, apical, pontique and nuchale. There have been found several morphological differences in the cerebral cortex not only from subject to subject, but even within the same individual. The variability of the date of appearance, the width and form of the fissures and grooves is of such magnitude as to make a generalization on the point impossible. One significant point in the work is that the fissure of Rolando, the appearance of which the classics place in the fifth month, has been found by M. Barbe to be clearly marked in several embryos in the third month of development. FORM AND CAUSALITY IN EARLY DEVEL- OPMENT. By Albert M. Dalcq. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.50. 82 x 52; [71 + I97 + X plates; I938. This book is a monograph covering-as Professor Dalcq expressly warns us-his special views on the early organization of the egg, and on the causes, the mechan- ics, of development. Out of the abun- dance of available data, the author has chosen to present those embryological facts which to him suggest a general theory of organismal development. Believing that "the causes [of develop- ment] cannot belong to any other category than the intimate physical and chemical nature of the germ materials, and their particular situation at the stage con- sidered," and admitting that the nuclear factors have not yet been sufficiently analyzed, Dalcq feels that the cytoplasmic factors may now be defined in concrete</page><page sequence="22">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 485 terms. He concludes that the material bases of germinal organization lie in a two-fold chemo-differentiation: first, in a "cortical field" (the dorso-ventral field of chordates, or its equivalent), and, second, in a "spatial gradient" (the yolk gradient of chordates, or its equivalent). Typically the former is a gradient of some substance dispersed mainly through the cortex of the egg, with its maximum concentration at the animal pole; the latter is a gradient of some substance dispersed more generally throughout the cytoplasm, but decreasing from the vege- tative pole. The interaction between the "formative" or cortical field and the "differentiation" or "general activity" field provides the functional basis of morphogenesis. "In my opinion," writes Dalcq, "the organization of the egg- or of the sperm-prolongs that of the germ concealed in the parent soma.... The prime factors responsible for mor- phogenesis are contained in the germ, and not imposed on it from the outside." ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. By H. Rouviere. Translated from the French by M. J. Tobias. Edwards Bros., Ann Arbor, Mich. $4.00. 10A x 81; ix + 3I8; I938. This is the English translation of the painstaking and exhaustive work of Rouviere's Anatomie des Lymphatiques de l'Homme (cf. Q. R. B., vol. 7, no. 4). Many first-class drawings illustrate the work. Since the study of the lymphatic system is very often given too little at- tention in the medical schools as well as in most of the anatomic textbooks, the translation will find many friends among anatomists and clinicians. "In addition to completeness in anatomical descriptions of the lymphatic apparata of the bodily organs," the translator writes in the introduction, "Professor Rouviere rarely overlooked an opportunity to direct at- tention to the regions where lymph nodes or lymphatics are intimately related to other organs or nerve trunks, and in many instances he has indicated the possible implications of such relationship." THE BASIC MECHANICS OF HUMAN VISION. By R. Brooks Simpkins. Chapman and Hall, London. i2.S. 6d. net. 82 X 5x ; viii + zz8 + 8 plates; I939. This book will be of great interest to the experienced ophthalmologist who alone is able to prove the theories of the author. In particular he is of the opinion that the early prescription of glasses has a weakening effect on the eyes and especially that their employment by the increasing number of children is a serious menace to general health. More and more persons otherwise physically fit become dependent upon an artificial method of sight-aug- mentation when by proper exercising of the eye muscles sight deterioration, in the author's opinion, can be checked. The book is illustrated by many drawings showing the different stages and functions of the visual mechanism. It is well written and deserves to be carefully examined. THE EMBRYOLOGY OF FLEAS. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Volume 98, Num- ber 3. (Publication 3527). By Edward L. Kessel. Smithsonian Insti- tution, Washington. 45 cents. 98 x 61; 78 + I. plates; I939 (paper). The author presents his researches on the heretofore little studied phase of the pulicine life cycle, namely, that of the embryological development. Ctenocepha- lides felis (Bouche) (the cat flea), Nosopsyl- lus fasciatus (Bosc.) (the common rat flea), and Hystrichopsylla dippiei Roths (a giant form found in nests of the wood rat Neotoma) were selected as subjects for this study. Together the three families repre- sented by the subject species contain over four-fifths of the total number of genera belonging to the order Siphonaptera. The microtechnique used in this study is described in the first part of the mono- graph. At the end of the text are twelve excellent plates containing go figures. There is an extensive bibliography. GROSS ANATOMY. A Brief Systematic Pres- entation of the Macroscopic Structure of the Human Body.</page><page sequence="23">486 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY By A. Brazier Howell. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York and London. $6.oo. 9x X 62; vii + 403; I939. The decreasing amount of time allotted in medical schools to the study of gross anatomy has made it impossible for the student to assimilate all of the details. Voluminous texts and reference books increase the difficulty of sifting the trivial from the important. Howell's excellent condensation is an effort to overcome this handicap of the student. There is little consicderation of physiology or histology, but necessary references are made to embryological derivation. Few illustrations are given, an antomical atlas being a required adjunct. The volume contains a very complete and useful index. CHORDATE ANATOMY. By Herbert V. Neal and Herbert W. Rand. P. Blakiston's Son and Co., Philadelphia. $3.50. 9 x 6; x + 467; 1939. In essence this volume is a condensation of Comparative Anatomy (Q.R.B., vol. i2., no. i) and contains the same excellent features of that work. However, the present material is such that it can be comfortably covered in the limited time allotted to comparative anatomy in the curriculum of the pre-professional student. It omits much of the detailed discussions of histology and embryology found in the earlier volume. This systematic study clearly describes and depicts the anatomi- cal evidences of the evolution of the human body from lower forms. FINGERPRINTS: History, Law and Romance. By George W. Wilton. Foreword by Robert Heindl. William Hodge and Co., London, Edinburgh and Glasgow. izs. 6d. net. 512; xix + 3I7 + ii plates; I938. These pages tell an interesting history of dermatoglyphics. However, an undue amount of paper (half of the book) is used over the petty argument as to who first suggested fingerprints as a method of criminal detection. The author gives the laurel to Dr. Henry Faulds. A com- plete survey is presented of fingerprint cases throughout the world. It is re- grettable that so little space is devoted to the rBle of dermatoglyphics in an- thropology. ANATOMIE GENERALE. Origines des Formes et des Structures Anatomiques. By H. Rouviere. Masson et Cie, Paris. 70 francs. II'8 X 7 8; [41 + I92.; I938 (paper). In this general anatomy the author stresses particularly the relation between the mechanics and the formation of the parts and organs of the body, and discusses, in some cases, modifications in the struc- ture and their inheritance. Physicochem- ical influences are not treated in detail. The bibliography runs to 364 titles. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY PROTEIN METABOLISM IN THE PLANT. By Albert C. Chibnall. Yale University Press, New Haven; Oxford University Press, London. $4.oo. 9 x 6; xiii + 306 + 3 plates; I939. This detailed and highly technical book makes its appeal principally to plant physiologists and biochdmists. Excellent reviews and criticisms of historical and recent work on protein metabolism of seedlings mark the early chapters, the work of Schulze and Prianischnikow be- ing particularly stressed. In regard to the formation of glutamine, the author concludes from experiments in his own laboratory that this substance can be produced in limited amounts by primary protein decomposition, and that glutamine and asparagine can also have a secondary origin. It is emphasized " that transfer of nitrogen from protein to amides does not necessarily imply that formation of these amides is exclusively a matter of protein metabolism." One sees the agricultural value of this work in a chapter on the proteins of pasture plants. The quality of various types of pasturage, and seasonal variation in quality is shown in several experiments.</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 487 The value of protein analysis is well demonstrated in a discussion of the amount of cystine necessary in sheep forage to produce a high quality fleece. The last part of the volume reviews studies on leaf metabolism and its regu- lation. Within a few hours after leaf detachment protein decomposition can be detected. However, judgment is re- served as to the reason for such metab- olism. Several appendices present meth- ods of analysis of impure leaf-protein preparations. There are 370 bibliographic references. LEs GROUPES SANGUINS. Leur Application a la Biologie, ? la Medecine et au Droit. By Ludwik HirsZfeld. Translated from the Polish by Hanna Hirszfeld. Masson and Cie, Paris. 30 francs. 74 x 52; [4] + I69; I938 (paper). Professor Hirszfeld summarizes in this monograph the knowledge that has been acquired about blood-groups, particularly those aspects of the subject that pertain to practical problems of medicine, law, anthropology, and biology in general. The first two chapters are of an intro- ductory nature and deal respectively with the physiological characteristics of the blood and with Mendelian inheritance. The author proceeds then to a more de- tailed examination of the subject and describes first of all the classification of blood-groups and their hereditary trans- mission. In the following chapters he discusses also in detail the significance of the observations made with reference to problems of establishing paternity, of detecting racial mixtures and of studying certain kinds of immunological reactions. The book closes with a chapter in which the author enumerates some of the prob- lems which he believes are of great im- portance and deserve to be tackled im- mediately. Although there are available a number of good treatises on blood- groups, this is one of the most lucid and comprehensive expositions of the subject that has appeared to date. It reflects the author's long experience as one of the leading investigators in the field. ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSIOLOGY. V0o- ume I. Edited by James M. Luck and Victor E. Hall. Annual Reviews, Inc., Stanford University P. O., Cal. $5.00. 81 x 6; Vii + 70S; I939. Undoubtedly the success attained by the Annual Review of Biochemistry (now in its eighth volume) has encouraged Dr. Luck and a group of physiologists to launch this annual. The members of the edi- torial committee are as follows: A. J. Carlson, J. F. Fulton, M. H. Jacobs, F. C. Mann and W. J. Meek. It is their hope that this new Review will supplement the invaluable service which has been rendered for many years by Physiological Reviews and the Ergebnisse der Physiologie. We have not thought of publishing exhaustive treat- ments of selected topics such as may be found in these journals. The Annual Review of Physiology will have a somewhat different function and will be of value to the reader, not because of its depth of penetration into stated subjects, but because of its breadth, through year by year resumes of the signifi- cant work in the entire field of physiology. Twenty-four sections, written by well- known and authoritative investigators, treat such subjects as permeability, bi- ological effects of radiation, growth, temperature regulation, physiology of the liver, blood, the spinal cord and reflex action, physiological psychology, kidney, etc. As in the Review of Biochemistry each section concludes with an extensive bib- liography and the volume has both author and subject indexes. YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. By Victor Heiser. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $X.5o. 8 x 52; 300; I939. The author wisely emphasizes the fact that the material in this book is not meant to be a textbook to replace the physician. It is not for the ill, the lame, or the blind, but for those individuals who are not normally under a doctor's supervision. Dr. Heiser's experience in public health work in this country and in foreign nations has given him a broad perspective of living conditions and stand- ards of health throughout the world, and based on this experience he now proffers a bookful of sensible suggestions for a healthier and happier life.</page><page sequence="25">488 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Half of the volume considers the troubles between man and his food, and since we are omnivorous creatures, there is plenty of material for discussion. There are very few verbotens and no one need fear after reading this entertaining volume that his life will be spent hereafter in utter discomfort wondering what would be the proper thing to do. Since the author himself is still quite hale and hearty, it will probably pay us all to follow his advice. FIGHTING FOR LIFE. By S. Josephine Baker. The Macmillan Co., New York. $X.75. 88 X 5; [6] + z64 + 8 plates; I939. The theory and practice of child hygiene the world over is in a great measure due to the pioneering efforts of Dr. S. Josephine Baker. In this autobiography she has incorporated, in a delightfully readable manner, her experiences in (i) convincing her male colleagues that a hard-working woman has a place in the medical pro- fession; and (X) in convincing this nation and the world that the most fruitful work in saving babies' lives is that which aims to prevent child diseases rather than that which aims to cure the pitifully diseased and half-dead forms of humanity. In the second undertaking, Dr. Baker inaugu- rated the principle of preventive medicine in child hygiene, with all its far reaching and fruitful results. The volume is, in essence, the record of a free thinking American woman endowed with a conviction concerning her contri- bution to the world, and with the en- thusiasm and persistence necessary for carrying that conviction to reality. The author's professional mode of thinking and her authoritative mode of writing have in no way been belittled by the spicy humor which adds so greatly to the interest of the book. I. THE CENTER, THE GROUP UNDER OBSER- VATION, SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND STUDIES IN PROGRESS. Stuidies From The Center for Research in Child Health and Development, School of Public Health, Harv- ard University. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development. Volume IV, No. x (Serial No. 20). By Harold C. Stuart and Staff. Society for Research in Child Development, Na- tional Research Council, Washington, D. C. $1.75. 9 X 6; xiv + z6i; I939 (paper). This Center for Research in Child Health and Development was created some seven years ago mainly to provide the oppor- tunity and material for investigation on the mental and physical development of children and on the factors bearing upon the phenomenon of growth. As the title indicates this monograph is the first of a series of publications from the Center and is concerned with its organization and method of operation. First of all, the growth of the children is measured and studied with the aid of anthropometric, orthopedic, roentgenographic and photo- graphic techniques. The study of the factors influencing the growth is also approached from multiple angles since the inquiry concerns heredity, social and economic status, dietary habits and so on of the children. From the description given here it would seem that the investi- gation is conducted in the most ideal and thorough manner, and we look forward to the publication of the findings and results. THE PATIENT AS A PERSON. A Study of the Social Aspects of Illness. By G. Canby Robinson. The Common- wealth Fund, New York; Oxford University Press, London. $3.00. 9 x 6; xiv + 42.3; I939. This book presents the results of an inves- tigation carried on in the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1936 and I937, in which the clinical study of 174 patients in the medical wards and dispensary was supplemented by a study of the personal and social fac- tors in each case. The material is pre- sented in this book in the form of a brief abstract of the case history of each patient, including a discussion of the adverse social conditions found, and the effects on the medical status of the patient when the social condition was modified or the patient's attitude improved. The ab-</page><page sequence="26">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 489 stracts are segregated into chapters under the following headings: patients with circulatory symptoms, respiratory symp- toms, digestive symptoms, diabetes, syphi- lis and epilepsy, and psychoneuroses. The final chapter is devoted to a discussion of the importance of treating the patient as a whole. There is a bibliography of 2.8 titles, and an index. PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH. Fifth Edition. By C. E. Turner. The C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis. $3.00. 8.1 x 51; 652 + 4 plates; I939. The present edition of this well-known college textbook on hygiene follows essentially the same order of exposition as that of the preceding ones. The author seeks to present a comprehensive picture of contemporary knowledge about indi- vidual and community health as well as the anatomical, physiological and general biological foundations on which this knowledge rests. The contents of this book therefore cover a wide field: the organ-systems and their function in health and disease, modes of infection and con- tagious diseases, personal hygiene and sanitation, and the several phases of public health work and administration. Although necessarily very sketchy in parts and written in a style that occa- sionally acquires an evangelical tone (cf. the discussion on alcohol), the book is more than adequate for its purpose. Each chapter ends with a short list of the more important publications on the subject treated. LA MORT DES BRU'LES. btude Exp6ri- mentale. By Louis Christophe. Preface by Leon Binet. Masson et Cie, Paris. 40 francs. 92i x 6-; 95 + 2.o folding charts + 9 plates; I939 (paper). Important experiments were performed by the author in an attempt toward the solu- tion of the problem as to the processes causing death several days after injury from burns. Clinical and histological studies were made both on dogs that had themselves been subjected to burns and those that had not been so injured but died after per- fusion with blood from animals that had suffered a burn. The conclusion is that the toxic substance, although not suffi- cient to cause immediate death, is trans- mitted throughout the body by the blood stream, and when it reaches the brain causes injury to the vegetative centers, perhaps including the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the anterior hypo- thalamus, from which the animals even- tually die. The book is illustrated with photographs of apparatus and histological sections and tables showing the results of urine and blood tests on the experimental animals. MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY. By Kenneth L. Burdon. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.50. 84 X 558; xii + 763; I939. Since this book is intended primarily for the medical student beginning micro- biology, the author stresses the clinical rather than the technical aspects of the science-the ward work rather than the laboratory side-though there are chap- ters on classification and on laboratory procedure. The student who has just learned or is learning anatomy will be pleased to find infectious disease here treated in the same way, that is, by body systems. All infec- tions of the skin, whether due to mite, rickettsia, or coccus, are discussed in one section, instead of being scattered through the text according to taxonomic relations. Insofar as possible the rest of the body is handled similarly. The appendices contain laboratory methods, sources of information in the literature, and study questions. So You'RE GOING TO STOP SMOKING! By J. C. Furnas. Simon and Schuster, New York. $I. 5. 74 x S; vi + 97; I939. This amusing little book does not offer any sure-fire panacea for those who desire</page><page sequence="27">490 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY to quit smoking "gaspers" or other forms of tobacco. The' author himself belongs to the ranks of those who have sworn off the coffin nails but finds himself still con- suming them. However, good common sense remedies are proffered and several ways are suggested to fit individual tastes and inclinations. Truths and untruths concerning the tobacco habit have been separated and a consensus of present medi- cal knowledge is given a chapter of its own. Most of the material has been g leaned from a questionnaire sent to famous people and from the invaluable experiences of the author himself. We recommend this entertaining volume to all and sundry, whether they be tobacco addicts or not. THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY OF THE PITUITARY BODY. Volume IL. By H. B. Van Dyke. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $4.50. 9 x 6; xiv + 402.; I939. The present volume (for Vol. I, cf. Q.R.B., Vol. IS, No. 3) begins where the first volume left off in I935 and includes references to all important experimental work appearing in I936 and I937 and some I938 reports. The author states that in the present volume "I have under- taken to meet the need of sifting and classifying the new data and concepts and of modifying the old by endeavoring critically to review recent work on the physiology and pharmacology of the pituitary body. A brief summary of my opinion of the present state of our knowl- edge has been added to each chapter." The material is arranged in ten chapters and in an appendix is a discussion of "The structural formulas and principal actions of hormones of natural origin." The bibliography (I,4I8 titles) represents 78 per cent of the articles which were con- sidered. MALARIA IN PANAMA. The American Jour- nal of Hygiene, Monographic Series, No. i3. By James S. Simmons, with the collabora- tion of George R. Callender, Dalferes P. Curry, Seymour C. Schw4t4 and Raymond Randall. Johns Hopkins Press, Balti- more. $i.io net. 9 x 6; xv + 32.6; I939. The subject matter is presented in three sections. The first, which is entitled "Malaria on the Isthmus of Panama (150I-I938)," includes two chapters, one of which deals with the history of the disease in this locality from the time of the early Spanish settlements until the beginning of the Panama Canal, and the other with its prevalence throughout the Republic of Panama up to the present time. Part two, entitled "Malaria in the Panama Canal Zone (I904-I938)," is divided into five special chapters and the third part, which is entitled "Malaria in the military forces of the Panama Canal Zone (I9II-I938)," is composed of four chapters devoted to a general considera- tion of the malaria situation which con- fronts the United States Army. THE NEWER KNOWLEDGE OF NUTRITION. Fifth Edition Entirely Rewritten. By E. V. McCollum, Elsa Orent-Keiles and Harry G. Day. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.5o. 8% X %; ix + 70I; I939- All those acquainted with previous edi- tions of this important book will welcome its reappearance (the fourth edition has been out of print since I935). It has been completely rewritten but there has been no change in the general plan of previous editions which represent an attempt to interpret the meaning of the extensive experimental work relating to nutrition and described in numerous journals during recent years. Our pur- pose has been to present the subject matter in a form intelligible and useful to the large number of stu- dents, teachers, physicians, dentists, and others who are interested in being informed on the present knowl- edge of nutrition.

New Series, Volume XXXI. By Herbert Fox. University of Pennsyl- vania Press, Philadelphia. $,7.oo. IIA x 94; 76 + iS plates; 1939 (paper). More than 1700 skeletal analyses and autopsies of wild animals have revealed that chronic arthritis is prevalent in nature. Those having the most con- spicuous lesions were found to be the macrosomic animals, while small-bodied mammals, as the rodents and bats, were free of any symptoms. Studies of this nature, it is hoped, will afford some clue to the yet baffling etiology of arthritis in man. There are twelve plates showing the affected skeletal parts, but no bibliography as all this material is practically unique. THE WISDOM OF THE BODY. Revised and Enlarged Edition. By Walter B. Cannon. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $3.5o. 82 x 54 333;I1939. Since 1932., when The Wisdom of the Body first appeared (cf. Q.R.B., Vol. 7, No. 3), much has been done in the experimental field which bears on the problems that Dr. Cannon so ably and interestingly discussed in that volume. The present edition has been revised to include all new pertinent data. The general reader with a liking for science will find this even more absorbing than the earlier book while the student of biological problems cannot neglect a treatise which so clearly and soundly knits together the results of innumerable physiological experiments to give us a picture of the stability of the body as a whole and the means whereby that organization is maintained.

This volume contains the lectures, to- gether with the general discussions fol- lowin them, presented at the Third Frankfurt Conference for Collaboration in Medical and Natural Sciences. The lec- tures are divided into three groups. K. Felix, W. Dirscherl, H. Gremels, H. Bennhold, and Th. Wagner-Jauregg dis- cuss the purely chemical aspects of albumen. E. Abderhalden, W. Wei- chardt, R. Prigge, R. Otto and K. Lau- benheimer have contributed papers on the role of albumen in immunity reactions. Various aspects of the role of albumen in metabolism and nutrition, and the culture of plants with a high albumen content are treated by K. Wetzel, C. Schopf, F. Laibach, H. Fink, R. von Sengbusch, W. Heupke, and K. Zorn. Author and subject indices have been added. CRYSTALLINE ENZYMES. The Chemistry of Pepsin, Trypsin, and Bacteriophage. By John H. Northrop. Columbia Uni- versity Press, Morningside Heights, N. Y. $3 .00. 9 x 681; xv + I76; I939. The general chemistry of enzymes is presented early in the book, followed by chapters on the properties, activation, isolation, and tests for purity of pepsin, trypsin, chymo-trypsin and their inactive precursors. The bacteriophage, though never crystallized, exhibits experimental results similar to those of the active enzymes. An extensive appendix details methods of preparation and estimation of these substances. LE PHOSPHORE DES VEGETAUX. Son role dans 'e'nergetilue cellulaire. II. Phosphore Lipidique. By E.

Princeton University Press, Princeton. $2..oo. 9 x 6; xiii + I52; I938.</page><page sequence="30">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 493 After hundreds of articles and books have been written about the differences in the reproductivity of the socio-economic classes and some English and American writers, particularly, have gone so far as to see the downfall of civilization as a consequence of this phenomenon, it now appears that maybe in the near future such class differences as there are will be considerably diminished. This is the aspect of the problem that Innes has mainly investigated and discusses in this monograph. Tlhe first half of the book is concerned with a description of the trend of birth-rates in England and con- tains a painstaking reexamination of the I9II British Census Report on marriage fertility. Rearranging the original data in several ways brings out nothing new and serves only to reinforce the previous conclusions. The second part of the book presents the results of what is practically a continuation of Heron's well-known study. The author examines for the period I909-I934 the birth rates of the districts of London. The main findings are that during this period the birth- rates have declined in all the districts, those of the poor as well as of the rich. But,* during the period of observation, the differences between the poor and rich districts have become less and less marked so that it would seem that there is mani- fest a tendency towards equalization of the reproductivity of the socio-economic classes. With restraint to be admired the author expresses such a conclusion in very cautious terms. BIOMETRY DEMOGRAPHICAL DATA, CLEVELAND, OHIO, 193I-I937. By Howard W. Green. Cleveland Health Council, iOOi Huron Road, Cleveland. $i.oo. ii x 82; [4] + 248; I938 (paper). INFANT MORTALITY AND EcoNoMIc STATUS. Cleveland Five-City Area I9I9-I937. By Howard W. Green. Cleveland Health Council, ioo i Huron Road, Cleveland. $i.oo. iix 81; [6] + I3; I939 (paper). In the first of these reports, the author presents for each year from I93I to I937 the vital statistics of Cleveland, Ohio. Following the order given by the U. S. Vital Statistics reports, the data included here concern general mortality, infant mortality and births. For some unex- plained reason stillbirths have been omnitted. The second monograph is devoted to an interesting analysis of the trend in infant mortality as observed from i91g to I937 in IO sections of Cleveland. These sections represent the subdivisions resulting from the ten-fold classification of the city area according to economic status. The findings, while not unique, bring into relief facts which have not always been given sufficient consideration. In the first place it is shown that the rate of decline in infant mortality has been higher in the poorer than in the richer districts. Secondly, it is observed that the neonatal (deaths under i month of age) mortality rate is about the same for all districts, independent of economic status, and has not altered significantly during the years from I9I9 to I937. The importance of this fact has never been sufficiently recognized although it has been pointed out by a number of investiga- tors. Both publications give basic data of the kind that maybe some day will be available for all communities. POPULATION AND FERTILITY. By D. V. Glass and C. P. Blacker. Popu lation Investigation Committee, London- 3S. 82 X 512; IOI; I939 (paper). This booklet aims to inform the layman about the simpler and more common statistical methods employed to measure population fertility. It describes the basic data to be found in the vital statistics reports of various countries and discusses the additional information that would be desirable and useful to obtain. The authors have also included here the "age pyramid" of the populations of iS coun- tries and the recent figures regarding their population size, natality "reproduction rates" and world war dead (a very timely and instructive bit of information con- sidering the present international situa- tion).

PRACTICAL ANTHROPOMETRY. Second Edi- tion. By Ales Hrdlicka. Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia. $3.50. IO X7; Xiv + 23I; I939. The changes introduced in this second edition of Hrdlicka's book consist mainly of the necessary additions to bring the book up to date. The description of the technique of measuring the living body has been amplified, sections on fingerprints and blood tests have been added as well as illustrative data on physical measure- ments. From its frst publication Hrdlicka's Anthropometry has been the standard textbook in most American institutions where physical anthropology is taught; therefore this second edition which does not substantially differ from the previous one will serve as well the purpose of teaching the art and principles of measuring the human body. GRUNDBEGRIFFE UND HAUPTSATZE DER HOHEREN MATHEMATII insbesondere fzlr Ingenieure und Naturforscher. By Gerhard Kowalewski. Verlag Walter de Gruyter and Co., Berlin. RM. 5. 9X61; I56; I938. The theory of determinants, vector analy- sis, limiting values, integral and differen- tial calculus are all presented in this brief volume. Hence the treatment of each subject is necessarily limited. The author gives no applications of the material, confining his book to pure mathematics. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN MARITAL HAP- PINESS. By Lewis M. Terman, assisted by Paul Buttenwieser, Leonard W. Ferguson, Wini- fred B. Johnson and Donald P. Wilson. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $4.00. 9 x 6; xiv + 474; 1938. This book contains a detailed account of the observations made by the author and his associates on the married life and reac- tions of 792. couples. These couples are a selected group so far as concerns social, economic and educational status. They represent the higher and more articulate classes. About IO per cent of the couples were obtained through family relations institutes and therefore are, in the ma- jority, maritally maladjusted. The ma- terial consists of questionnaires filled out by the husbands and wives. An elaborate and clever scheme was developed in order to ascertain that the responses of the husband or the wife did not affect those of the other partner and in turn to assure the subjects that the answers would re- main unidentified. The questionnaire dealt with some 400 items regarding (a) personality characteristics as meas- ured with the Bernreuter and Strong tests; (b) expressions of opinion about the ideals of marriage; (c) feelings about the married life and spouses of the subject; (d) parents and childhood of the subjects; (e) the sexual habits and manifestations of the subjects. From such data was derived an index of marital happiness which is not above criticism, although not as unsatisfactory as an index of its kind usually is. The relation of marital happi- ness to the numerous single items of the questionnaire was then studied. As one follows the analysis it becomes evident that the author is not content to fit theory to observation but has some preconceived notion which he seeks to prove. This is that the personality factor is of great importance in marital relations while the sexual element plays only a secondary role. In this respect one notes the au- thor's efforts to explain away results which apparently are as significant as those he accepts without hesitation. The value of the study is therefore con- siderably weakened. For the time being the only conclusion which can be drawn from the observations outlined is that all the factors contributing to marital happiness have not yet been identified. LANGUAGE AND SPEECH HYGIENE. An Application of General Semantics. Outline</page><page sequence="32">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 495 of a Course. Monograph 1. General Seman- tics Monographs. By Wendell Johnson. Institute of General Semantics, I234 East s6th St., Chicago. $i.5o (payable in advance). io4 X 82; v + 54; I939 (paper). This is a general outline and abstract of the course Speech Hygiene which was pre- sented by the author at the University of Iowa in the summer of I938. Dr. Johnson became interested in General Semantics after reading Count Korzybski's develop- ment of this subject. Especially inter- ested was he in the application of general setnantics to his own particular field, namely, the scientific investigation of stuttering. The author first makes some introduc- tory statements concerning the study of word-fact relations as a basic problem in general setnantics, the meaning of the orientational adequacy of word-fact rela- tions, and the important point that the study of word-fact relations is not con- cerned with words or facts as such but with the relations between them as made by human beings and the degree of agree- ment among individuals in word-fact relations. Various quantitative tech- niques for the measuring of the degree of agreement are then given. The process of abstracting is next explained and a modified form of Korzyb- ski's "structural differential" (a schematic diagram of the process of abstracting) is shown. Following a discussion of labels, descriptions and inferences, the author turns the attention of the reader to the study of remedial general semantics and its far-reaching fields of application. A short alphabetical list of literature is appended. PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS OF HEALING. An Introduction to Psychotherapy. By William Brown. University of London Press, London. 7s. 6d. net. 82 X 5; vii + ZZ4; I938. This book is designed as an introduction to the subject of psychotherapy. Essen- tially, it is a credo, presenting the author's evaluation, after twenty-five years of clinical practice, of the tenets of various European contributors to psychiatric thought, notably Freud, Jung, Adler, Janet, Charcot, Bernheim and Coue. No mention is made of American psychiatry. The chief psychotherapeutic procedures discussed are mental analysis, hypnosis, suggestion, autosuggestion and progres- sive relaxation, as they are used singly and in combination. There is very little discussion of the psychoses, and of the psychoneuroses, only hysteria, neuras- thenia and compulsion neuroses are really considered. General problems of adoles- cence and maturity are covered in separate chapters. There is considerable philo- sophical digression, permeated throughout by the author's personal point of view. As a text, the book seems unfortunate in its poor organization of subject matter, the incompleteness of its scope and the somewhat uncritical tendency to mingle opinion, conjecture and fact. There is a bibliography of ioo titles, and brief author and subject indices. PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL CONTROL IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTION AND CULTURE. Three Lectures at The Tavistock Clinic, July 1937. By Ira S. Wile. Oxford University Press, London, New York and Toronzto. $i.zS. 8x X 521;, [9] + 57; I939 (paper). This small book comprises three lectures delivered by Dr. Wile at the Tavistock Clinic in England. The first lecture en- titled Personality in Terms of Constitution, is concerned with the general significance and meaning of constitution which is de- fined as "the aggregate of the physical and vital powers of an individual- physique or physical nature-also the ag- gregate of an individual's mental powers or qualities-temperament-or fisposi- tion." In the second lecture, Personality in Relation to Culture, the question of personal adjustments required in social living is discussed, and the various pat- terns of behavior which have been worked out for accotnplishing this adjustment. The third lecture, Social Control and the Prevention of Personality Disorders, presents data on age, educational status, and voca- tional status in mental disease, and con-</page><page sequence="33">496 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY siders various possibilities for social prophylaxis, religious, recreational, eco- nomic, etc. Dr. Wile concludes: "Social control should safeguard constitution by developing a more favorable culture." THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MAKING LIFE IN- TERESTING. By Wendell White. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.50. 7 X 54; xv + 2I5; I939. This book is designed for the sitnple- minded layman with a sense of social failure, to whom all the successes he lacks are promised if he will only master the techniques herein outlined. These techniques comprise arousing curiosity, keeping up suspense, giving surprise, varying the voice and play of the features and varying the doing of things of every kind, a chapter being devoted to a de- tailed analysis of each. Having, by the application of these techniques, banished tedium and achieved his desired social goal, it should be possible for him to survey with equanitnity the unwholesome behavior he has been spared, i.e. truancy, pyromania, alcoholistn, gambling, etc. Many of the suggestions for furthering mental health put forward in the final chapters of the book are sound beyond controversy. A list of self-testing ques- tions are appended. There is little doubt but that the book will have a cotnmercial success, and it is hoped that that of the readers will be as great. THE MYSTERY OF THE BURIED CROSSES. A Narrative of Psychic Exploration. By Hamlin Garland. E. P. Dutton and Co., New York. $3.75. 84 x 51; 35I; I939. The author, through the aid of a medium, has been able to communicate with the spirits and has obtained their aid to locate crosses buried centuries ago by the Indians. There is still some mystery as to who buried them, but their location is real for wherever the spirits guided Mr. Garland and his cohorts, a cross was usually found (usually, because spirits apparently can err like the rest of us mortals). We are as- tounded at the apparent ease with which one can communicate with such personages as Doyle, Kipling, et at. We can't under- stand why this method hasn't been used before to inquire about unfinished work from departed scientists, or maybe to locate the burial place of the missing link. Affidavits, lists of witnesses, and photo- graphs of ectoplasmic fortns make this work one necessary of serious considera- tion for those interested in psychic phenomena. THE LOGIC OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY. By Carroll C. Pratt. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.oo. 8' x 51; Xvi + i85; I939. The impression received in reading this book is that it was written less with a view to influence the reader than to clarify the author's own thoughts on the subjects considered. The entire field of psychology is surveyed, the historical aspects, the points of views of different schools, and the different methodologies. The result is a re-evaluation of funda- mental probletns which, to this reviewer, seetns somewhat academic, but which is understandable in the light of the author's attitude that psychologists need more than any other group of scientists the protection of cloisters, an atmosphere of detachment and leisure. They can be most useful to society by staying in their laboratories and li- braries, there to remain until they can come forth with reliable predictions and well-tested applications. Those who are in the midst of earthquakes and bat- tles do not discover the laws of motion or the reasons why men fight. There is an index, but no formal bibli- ography.

The cases investigated include first admission to the Utica State Hospital in i92.8, i92.9 and I930, and comprised i55 manic-depressive patients and I75 dementia praecox patients. De- tailed analyses of the family and environ- mental history of those two groups of patients were made. The expectation of mental disease among the general popula- tion of New York State was taken as the norm. The general conclusion with re- gard to each psychotic group is reached that "we do not as yet possess any exact statistical theory of inheritance, capable of describing the transmission of mental disease from one generation to another. We do feel justified in concluding, however, that there is some generalized basis, ac- counting for a family predisposition." There is a full, pertinent bibliography and an index. SCIENCE AND PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA. By G. N. M. Tyrrell. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $ 82 x 52; xv + 379; I939- The object of this book is to present what has been accomplished in the field of psychical research by strictly scientific method. Classical evidence, taken par- ticularly from the records of the English Society for Psychical Research, is presented for the reader, as well as the interpreta- tions which have been imposed. The subject-matter is presented in five parts: I. Spontaneous Extra-Sensory Perception, II. Experimental Extra-Sensory Percep- tion, III. Significance of the Evidence, IV. The Mediumistic Trance and V. Theoretical Aspect of the Mediumistic Trance. The book is well written and the subject-matter receives as fair and comprehensive a handling as it is possible for a believer to give. However, to the critical reader the gap between evidence and interpretation will seem wide. In an appendix, the libraries throughout the world where the Proceedings of the English Society for Psychical Research may be found are listed. ALFRED ADLER: THE MAN AND HIS WORK. Triumph over the Inferiority Complex. By Hertha Orgler. With Foreword by 0. H. Woodcock. C. W. Daniel Co., London. 8s. 6d. net. 82 x 52; Z41 I939 This book by a close personal associate and devoted disciple of Dr. Adler, is di- vided into three parts. Part I, Adler's Development up to his Creation of Indi- vidual Psychology, presents personal data on Adler's life and a brief account of his break with Freud. In Part II, the tenets of Individual Psychology are discussed in a rather general way. Part III, the Applica- tion of Individual Psychology, is con- cerned with the importance of Adler's views for education and for psycho- therapy. A chapter is devoted to de- scribing the dissemination of Adler's views throughout Europe and the United States. The book is written with more fervor than objectivity, and seems inadequate both as a biographical contribution and as a technical exposition. A complete bibli- ography of Adler's writings is appended. THE SOLUTION OF MULTIPLE CHOICE PROB- LEMS BY CHIMPANZEES. Comparative Psy- chology Monographs. Volume I5, Number 3. Serial Number 75. By Kenneth W. Spence. The Johns Hop- kins Press, Baltimore. $i.oo. IO X 6x 54; I939 (paper)- By the simplification of previously used standard techniques in testing the behav- ioristic adaptation of chimpanzees, the author has been able to arrive at the analysis of the basis of solution of several problems of multiple choice, as well as the nature of the reaction tendencies exhib- ited prior to solution. With I7 chimpan- zees whose ages ranged from z to 22. years, it was found that all solved the problems about equally well. The prob- lems represented a graded series in diffi- culty, yet all were approached and solved by essentially the same behavioristic pro- cedure. The relearning of a solution after an intervening period in which several other problems were solved, required only about one sixth the number of trials as the original learning period required.</page><page sequence="35">498 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY HABIT CLINICS FOR CHILD GUIDANCE.

DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUIBUSDEM ALIIS THE MARCH OF MIND. A Short History of Science. By F. Sherwood Taylor. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.00. 82 X S; XiV + 320 + I4 plates; I939. This book could just as aptly be called "the development of the scientific method." In the opening chapters we see men struggling with magic to explain the natural world; then, further along, the scientist of the Middle Ages combats theology, and finally, championed by Da Vinci, Newton, Descartes and Darwin, the scientific method triumphs. In the au- thor's words, "the religious man today is not troubled by a farrago of fables nor by the necessity of literal adherence to a book. If he finds the Kingdom of Heaven, it is within him." Aside from a tendency to make theology the villain, the author has given a well- rounded picture of the growth of twen- tieth-century science, the changing atti- tude of men toward careful observation and experimentation. Eastern and Ara- bian science appears in its proper relation to European culture, instead of, as is more usually the case, being relegated to a few lines. In the later chapters, the histories of various specialties are told, for example, the study of sound, light, plant and ani- mal physiology. The material, however, is general, and the appeal of the book should be wide. It is relatively non- technical. SCIENCE IN PROGRESS. Edited by George A. Baitsell. Foreword by Harlow Shapley.

This volume contains a series of lectures given in I937 and I938 at the Society of Sigma XI by some ranking scientists who describe here the results of their researches for a larger public. Thus reports are de- livered on the latest progress in breaking down the atom (E. 0. Lawrence); the separation of isotopes and their use in chemistry and biology (H. C. Urey); the recent advances in the study of viruses and virus diseases (W. M. Stanley and L. 0. Kunkel); the functions of vitamins and hormones (K. E. Mason and R. R. Wil- liams); and internal secretions in repro- duction (Edgar Allen). There is another chapter on recent developments in our knowledge of chromosome structure (T. S. Painter); a new report on measuring elec- tric potentials of the human brain (E. N. Harvey); and finally a review on animal metabolism: from mouse to elephant (Francis G. Benedict). The book closes with a list of references to each chapter, and an index. SOMETHING SURPRISING. By Gladys Adshead. Pictures by Helen Rinald. Oxford University Press, London, New York and Toronto. $i.oo. 6 x 74; 69; 1939. The author of this delightful little volume has shown a real talent for writing stories for children; stories which are scientifically correct and at the same time interesting and readable for the 8 to iS year olds. In the 68 pages Miss Adshead has presented the drama of evolution from the formation of the earth, and the advent of life upon the earth down to the ap- pearance of man as an intelligent and in- ventive animal. For those who are being introduced for the first time to the wonders of evolution, this little book will truly reveal "something surprising." The line drawings by Miss Rinald will aid considerably in fixing in a child's mind the form of the plants and animals that have inhabited the earth through ages past. UNDERSTANDING OUR ENVIRONMENT.
