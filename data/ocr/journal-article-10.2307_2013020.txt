II PURPosIvE AcTIVITY IN ORGANISMS IN the first paper we examined the nature of purposive conscious- ness. We shall now consider purpose as a biological phenomenon. Certain acts of living creatures serve as a preparation for future situations; that is, an act may be determined or conditioned by some subsequent situation in much the same way as ordinary events are " causally" determined by preceding situations. For example, when I pause in reading at twilight to switch on the electric light, the act of turning the switch is in a measure conditioned by the ensuing illumination and by the fact that I subsequently renew my reading, though it is also causally determined by antecedent physiological circumstances. In the same way the actions which a dog performs while pursuing a rabbit are in a measure conditioned by the subse- quent act of catching and eating his prey as well as by the antecedent stimuli-visual and olfactory. Objections may be raised to the use of such terms as conditioned and determined in this connection. They seem to imply that the future situation forces or compels the act which precedes it-an in- terpretation of the relationship which will scarcely be admitted. Yet the scientist frequently describes the causal relation in these very terms. We say that a cause determines or conditions its effect, but we do not mean that it uses some overpowering force in the process. It is in fact an anthropomorphic interpretation of natural phenomena to conceive of the antecedent terms in a causal series as exerting compulsion upon subsequent events. The transformation of a quantity of hydrogen and a quantity of oxygen into water is due to their nature and to circumstances in the environment. The scien- tist does not picture some compelling force or entity directing the activity of the H and 0 atoms, putting them together, or threatening them with dire consequences unless they unite; in short, he does not believe that they are "forced" to undergo the change. Some writers, it is true, speak of "laws" as determinimg occurrences; but this interpretation is a case of the cart pushing the horse, for the "law" 29</page><page sequence="2">30 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is merely a generalized description of repeatedly observed facts. We formulate a law on the basis of observation; it is scarcely scien- tific to say that the law determines or compels the particular event. What the scientist understands by an event conditioning or de- termining another, then, is not compulsion from without or within; he means simply that the former event uniformly and in the nature of things leads to the latter, as shown by repeated observation. An "effect" is the observed aftermath of the "cause": we have every reason to believe that event A will be followed by event B; that in the nature of things the two belong in sequence. If we use the terms condition and determine in studying causal relations, they imply no more than a general temporal relation of before and after. The same is true of purposive relations. In purposive acts the temporal order noted in causation in some way becomes inverted. The dog certainly does not eat the rabbit before he catches it. Nevertheless, the act of eating is begun before the appropriate food stimulus appears. The later act (eating) is a condition of the various acts of pursuit and capture which precede it. In such a series of acts the present "hangs upon" the future, or is "determined by" it. The relation of terms in such a series is radically different from that in the ordinary causal series, the dis- tinctive feature being a partial inversion of temporal order.' This temporal inversion is just the sort of phenomenon which was noticed as the distinguishing mark of the purposive consciousness. We may, therefore, properly extend the notion of purpose to include the type of behavior characterized by anticipation. When we scan the field of biological phenomena we are struck by the overwhelming number of events which may be classed as pur- 1 It should be understood once for all that this "inversion of temporal order" is not a reversal of the "flow of time," or any other mystical paradox. I mean merely that certain events which usually occur in the order A, B, C, D, come to occur in the order A, C, B, D. In such cases we may say that 0 anticipates B. A philosophical colleague objects to the illustrations given in Part I., insist- ing that the B and the 0 are not the same in the purposive consciousness as in the memory consciousness. I admit freely that no event whatsoever is twice repeated. Scientific generalizations rest on similar transformations of similar data, not on identity of terms. A biological colleague, whose criticisms of this part of the paper have been most helpful, objects to the notion of inverted order in biological events. He interprets life and phylogeny as a series of cycles. The notion of a "life-cycle" is useful as a figurative description; but it is not exact-none of these " cycles" is completed. On the other hand, we do find countless examples of "anticipa- tion" in both behavior and growth processes. The concept of anticipation gives a biological meaning to the physicochemical transformations that occur in the organism.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 31 posive. First of all, acts which are acquired as the result of repeti- tion-so-called habits and intelligent acts-belong in this category. When the raccoon has learned to thread the maze, his act of travers- ing the passages and reaching the food-box is conditioned by his subsequent act of seizing the food. Similarly, instinctive acts exhibit a purposive character when viewed as complete biological series. The nest-building activity of birds, the mating proclivities of all sexually differentiated creatures, the food-getting reactions of medusae-all such functions appear to be conditioned in part by the future outcome. Nest-building is partly conditioned by the eggs which afterwards occupy the nest; mating by the offspring which develop after fertilization; food reactions by the metabolic changes which follow the reception of food. Finally, the phenomena of individual growth and phylogeny may be included in the list of purposive events. The various stages of cell-cleavage and development in the embryo are conditioned by the full-grown individual which finally appears, as well as by the physio- logical and morphological conditions in the fertilized egg. Individ- ual variations are conditioned by the "varieties" and new species to which they give rise. There are two sharply distinct modes of interpreting all these pur- posive activities, the mechanistic and the vitatistic. The mechanists believe that all modes of activity, organic and inorganic, are ulti- mately identical-that all may be formulated in the same general terms. The simplest modes of activity known to us are the physical and the chemical. Hence, the ideal of the mechanist in biology at present is to express all the activities of organisms in "physico- chemical " terms. Biochemistry and physiology have advanced far in this direction, though for some biologists purposive activity re- mains an insuperable obstacle to the complete acceptance of the mechanistic standpoint. The vitalists, on the other hand, assert that a physicochemical description is inadequate to account for organic growth if not for behavior in general. They assert that a non-mechanistic factor, an "entelechy," is needed in order to explain the peculiar inversion of the causal time-order which we discover in purposive phenomena. Now it may or may not be true that such a factor is present; but its existence is certainly not to be assumed a priori. Indeed, if entelechy is viewed as something which vitiates the orderly sequence of chemical and physical processes, the scientist will regard it as an admissible assumption only after the inadequacy of the mechanistic interpretation is made clear. According to the norm of parsimony, if a mechanistic process will serve as well as entelechy to explain any type of activity, it is preferable to the latter interpretation. The</page><page sequence="4">32 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY movements of the planets may be explained equally well by the re- lations of gravity or by the controlling guidance of mysterious spirits; we accept the former interpretation in accordance with Occam's principle of parsimony. Similarly, if it can be shown that the purposiveness which is manifest in the evolution of species, in individual development, in instinctive activity, and in intelligent actions can be explained as well on mechanistic grounds as by the controlling guidance of entelechy, it would seem preferable to adopt the former viewpoint. It remains to be seen whether the mechanistic interpretation is adequate to account for the purposive character of behavior and growth. The question is ultimately one of fact. But our interpre- tation of facts is often influenced by fundamental presuppositions. Thus the vitalists' attitude is determined largely by an uncritical conception of purpose. They carry over into biology a certain psy- chological datum, "directive potency," which appears from our earlier analysis to be an unessential factor in purpose. They tend to picture this entelechy as an intelligence, merely because in con- sciousness anticipation is experienced in the form of a thought. The present study assumes the mechanistic standpoint as a work- ing basis, though it admits the possible need of mending this view in the light of further evidence. We shall reject the implication of "potency" in the purposive sequence unless it be definitely demon- strated. We shall not admit the "conscious" character of biological anticipation in the absence of proof. The concept of purpose in the biological sphere is founded primarily upon an observed type of fact -a certain inversion of the usual temporal order of events. The pre- cise cause of this inversion is a problem for scientific investigation. Our analysis of purposive consciousness disclosed five factors: (1) A forethought of some future occurrence; (2) an attitude of assent; (3) a feeling of potency in the thought-process; that is, a belief that the thought has power to produce the foreseen result; (4) an associated self-notion; (5) a sense of the fitness or ulnfitness of the outcome or of certain intermediate steps. How far does pur- posive behavior include factors corresponding to these? 1. ANTICIPATION.-The fundamnental factor in purposive conscious- ness is the forethought. In purposive activity the corresponding factor is preparation, or anticipation of a future situation. We have already alluded to the wide prevalence of anticipation in the organic world. It is found in all the higher types of behavior, instinctive as well as intelligent. Even tropisms exhibit it. It appears in the phenomena of growth, both individual and phylogenetic. Let us first examine the nature of anticipation in these various types of activity. We shall then be in a position to discuss the mechanism of</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 33 anticipation, and the genesis of anticipatory events in the organic world. (1) Nature of Intelligent Reactions.-When I see a ball coming toward me and raise my hands to catch it, the reaction to contact is prepared in advance of the contact stimulus. The visual stimulus from the approaching ball initiates a set of movements which form a reaction to the contact stimulus that follows. When a raccoon is placed in a familiar maze and starts to traverse it, his locomotor adjustments are in part a reaction to the subsequent taste stimuli of the food lying at the far end. These are typical examples of reac- tions acquired by practise. The anticipation consists in an act which is begun in advance of a certain stimulus of taste or touch, but which refers to the future occurrence of such a stimulus. It is the biolog- ical analogue of the forethought, whether forethought or conscious- ness of the coming event be actually present or not. Instinctive Reactions.-Anticipation of the coming situation is found in many reflexes and instinctive responses. Take a case very low in the scale of organic life. A medusa is stimulated by juices, emanating from food particles near by, which permeate the water. Acting on this chemical stimulus, the creature moves its ten- tacles to and fro, and thus prepares to gather in the nutritious sub- stance. The reaction is anticipatory in that it serves to bring the creature into contact with the food sooner than if such movement did not occur. The anticipation of a future situation shown in this reaction of a medusa is typical of instinctive behavior generally. The feeding and reproductive instincts are all anticipatory. When a chicken pecks at a grain of corn it is starting the food-assimilating reaction before the food is touched. In the human infant the suckling act involves a chain of reflexes,-seeking the breast, grasping the nipple, sucking, swallowing. The biological meaning of these separate acts is not fully understood till we study the feeding behavior as a whole. The very first stage, seeking the breast, has reference to the final outcome, swallowing and digesting. So in the reproductive functions, the bi- ological meaning of sexual union is found in the production of the young. All these forms of behavior are anticipatory; they are re- actions to food, to offspring, before the stimulus is wholly present. Growth Processes.-If the reproductive functions are antici- patory, the stages of growth in the embryo manifest even more clearly the same characteristics. The organs appear in rudimentary form, they gradually shape themselves, till at length they attain the size and form of the corresponding organs in the parents. To study embryonic development as a mere causal succession of chemical re- actions is not sufficient. Its biological meaning is dependent on the outcome.</page><page sequence="6">34 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY So too in the functions of regulation and regeneration the signifi- cance of the process lies in the result. Healing is a reaction to the restored structure; it has a different biological significance from loss of blood when an artery is severed; this depends merely on the ante- cedent wound. The autonomic regulation of bodily heat is a reaction to the higher or lower temperature which will result-not merely to the antecedent fluctuations. The metabolic changes involved in nutrition and general main- tenance anticipate the subsequent condition of the creature in the same way. All the vital functions, in fact, are anticipatory; they prepare the organism for future conditions. Phylogenesis.-The evolution of new species shows a similar anticipatory character. Variations assist in the maintenance of the phyletic chain-biologically speaking they are reactions to the future of the species. Hence, the differences which occur from generation to generation and between individual and individual are not merely causal, but anticipatory. They are adaptations to the future condi- tion of the species or generic group. The reproductive functions may also be interpreted in a phylogenetic way. They are reactions to the future of the species, as well as to the future individual. (2) Mechanism of Anticipatory Behavior.-The presence of anti- cipation in behavior and growth is evident. It is one of the phe- nomena which science is called upon to investigate. For the function of science is to study all observable relations. If we consider not merely detached facts, but series of events in nature, the relation of future events to the present is as much a problem for scientific in- vestigation as the relation of past to present. This does not imply that the purposive relation supplants causa- tion. It is possible that if the anticipatory acts of behavior and growth were traced through from start to finish, each would be shown to be fully determined by its antecedents according to known physico- chemical processes. One science or scientific viewpoint usually serves to supplement another; it does not contradict or supersede it. When a drowning man cries for help, the physiological antecedents of his vocal cries may be completely determined in a causal way by his past history; yet the significance of the act lies partly in the future. The purposive relation "overlies" the causal relation. The vitalists assume that the causal succession is in some way altered by the phenomenon of anticipation-that the natural course of physical motion and chemical transformation is modified, directed, by the future outcome. The mechanists believe, on the other hand, that the physicochemical processes which constitute anticipatory re- actions are of themselves adequate to account for the inversion of temporal order.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS Two types of organic mechanism in animals serve especially to bring about anticipatory movements. These are the reflex mechan- isms of the distant-receptors2 and the central coordinating system. Both of these mechanisms are physicochemical structures. So far as observation goes they function in a physicochemical manner. The distant-receptors are organs capable of being stimulated by more or less distant objects. The different types vary greatly in this respect. The eye is stimulated by waves generated by objects which are often at very great distances; the visual reaction may occur long before the object itself could reach the creature. The physical vibra- tions which serve as auditory stimuli have a more limited range. The emanations which serve as olfactory stimuli have still greater limita- tions and their velocity is so low that the object from which they originate may under favorable conditions arrive at nearly the same time. If we examine a creature's reactions to a given object, we note that some of these reactions occur earlier than others, depending among other circumstances upon the type of receptor stimulated. In the case of the flying ball my reaction to the visual stimulus precedes my reaction to the contact; in the medusa's behavior toward food the response to chemical stimulation precedes the response to contact- plus-chemical. The sequence of stimulation and response is fairly constant; but the lapse of time between the starting of stimulatory impulses from an object and the beginning of the response varies according to the character of the stimulus. The central nervous mechanism serves to unite the various stimuli as well as to coordinate the response. In a plastic nervous system new combinations of stimuli lead to new responses, and repetitions of these combinations strengthen the mode of responses so obtained. The after-effect of past stimulation which is called "mnemonic" is due to the persistence of nervous paths or dispositions. One effect of this persistence is that a portion of the stimulus may initiate a reac- tion which on former occasions was started by the entire stimulus group. Thus a reaction which was formerly due to a succession of visual and contact stimuli, may come to be initiated by the visual stimulus alone when that stimulus occurs first. For example, when the flying ball is, say, fifty feet away, a reaction is started similar to that which was formerly brought about by the entire series of visual and contact stimuli. Thus I begin to respond not merely to the pres- ent visual stimulus, but to the future visual and contact stimuli. The raccoon in the familiar maze responds not only to the present visual, kinesthetic, and tactual stimuli, but to the coming gustatory 2 This term seems preferable to the usual expression, "distance-receptors.." The receptor is affected by stimuli from distant objects; it is not always differ- entially affected by the distance.</page><page sequence="8">36 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY stimuli which formed part of the original stimulus-group. All in- telligent anticipations are due to these central and distant-sense mechanisms. It seems established that the elementary reflexes which enter into reactions of every type are purely physicochemical processes. Re- sponses of the "intelligent" type are complex; they are character- ized by a great number of alternative nerve-paths, of which the im- pulse follows now one, now another. According to mechanistic prin- ciples the nerve impulse always follows the line of least resistance. But the vitalist asserts that the path followed in intelligent reactions is determined not by the line of least resistance, but by a directing entelechy. In the present state of science surely the burden of proof rests upon his shoulders. It would be difficult in complex phenomena for the mechanist to demonstrate that every single alteration in be- havior was due to a change in the neural tension. But he may very properly challenge the vitalist to demonstrate any specific instance in which the nervous impulse does not follow the path of least resist- ance. Till that is demonstrated we are justified in adopting the mechanistic interpretation of intelligent behavior as a working hy- pothesis. In lower species, whose nervous systems lack plasticity, and in certain types of fixed reactions among higher species, the anticipatory mechanism is due to inherited structure. The succession of reflexes which form the suckling instinct in the human infant is not due to the persistent effects of past stimulation upon the nerve paths, but to the growth of neurones in certain directions and into certain mutual relations. The complex nest-building instinct and the simpler food- gathering reflex of the medusae depend similarly upon growth of structural mechanisms. Each reflex is a "machine" constructed by the growth process. Separately they may exhibit no more antici- patory character than the patellar reflex; but in their combination the first motor impulse serves as an anticipation of the final situation. The structural mechanism which serves to bring about antici- patory behavior, both intelligent and instinctive, is thus in a measure the result of growth. We shall therefore turn to consider the antici- patory character of development and its mechanism. The Mechanism of Growth.-The real crux of anticipatory activ- ity appears to lie in the growth processes. According to Driesch, who has developed the vitalistic theory most systematically, the most conclusive objection to a mechanistic explanation of purposive phe- nomena is found in the processes of biological growth and repair. How, says Driesch in effect, can a mechanism provide for its own reconstitution? No machine known to us is able to construct another machine like itself, nor can it repair any of its own parts.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 37 The function of reproducing new organisms by growth appears less formidable to the mechanist than the problem of repairing inci- dental injuries. The germ cell in its first stage of development divides into two; one of these cells after several subsequent divisions generates a germ cell, with all the functions of the original germ cell from which it is derived. The other derivative cells specialize; they undergo various transformations which determine the shape and po- sition of the members and organs in the mature organism. Just what chemical changes are involved in growth metabolism is a problem for the biochemist to discover. Our knowledge is still very incomplete; but enough is known already to indicate that the pro- cesses concerned in development are real chemical transformations of colloidal compounds. Is it not for the vitalist, then, to demonstrate that a directive agent is involved in addition to the chemical changes themselves-that growth can not be fully explained without such an agent? Is it not a more natural presumption that the growth process is strictly chemical and physical? Why should we assume a non- mechanical factor unless some crucial test has demonstrated that chemicophysical factors are insufficient to account for the process? There is no question but that the animal organism is different from any type of machine so far devised by man. But it may yet prove to be a machine or mechanism of some type peculiar to itself. A locomotive is a very different sort of machine from a printing press, and a gasoline engine represents a different type of mechanism from either. There are machines and other machines; and our knowledge of mechanical possibilities is not yet complete. The functions of repair and regeneration constitute, in Driesch's opinion, the most striking argument in favor of vitalism. He be- lieves that they demonstrate conclusively the action of a directive agent. His experiments show that in certain lower organisms, even when more than one half of the body is destroyed, the creature is able to reconstitute the missing parts. Driesch found in the two-cell stage of the sea-urchin's egg, for example, that if one cell be removed the other cell will develop into a complete embryo of one half of the usual size; and that in the four-cell stage, if one cell be isolated, it develops into a complete embryo of very small size.3 In the blastula stage of the same species, if the blastula be cut with scissors in any direction, "each part so obtained will go on developing-provided it is not smaller than one quarter of the whole-and will form a complete larva of small size" (p. 11). No machine, Driesch argues, is "equi- potential" in all its parts. "A machine is a specific arrangement of parts, and it does not remain what it was if you remove from it any portion you like" (p. 18). 3 " Problem of Individuality, " page 10.</page><page sequence="10">38 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY There are two objections to this line of argument: 1. Driesch's definition of a machine is determined quite arbi- trarily. It is certainly not impossible to imagine a multiple machine, any part of which would function like the whole if the remainder were removed. Given a machine whose function is to construct a certain other machine, it is quite conceivable that if some portion of the constructed machine were destroyed the constructing machine would restore it. It is possible that the germ is such a constructing machine and the body such a constructed machine. Certainly the hypothesis of a vitalistic factor is not to be settled by a narrow and arbitrary definition of machine. 2. The actual facts of cell-cleavage do not lead necessarily to Driesch's conclusion in the tests which he describes. The process of mitosis demonstrates that the germ plasm possesses a double func- tion; it produces germ cells and somatic cells. Now if the original cell possesses this double function, it is neither "unthinkable" nor "impossible" that cells resulting from later divisions should possess the same function also. Thus when one cell is removed in the two- cell stage, or part of the blastula is isolated at a later stage, the re- moval of the cell or cells which operate to modify the direction of growth may lead to a renewal of the original generating function in the cell or cells which remain. In other words, the germ cell is known to possess the generating function at the outset; quite possibly this function is not lost after cleavage, but is modified in each cell as multiplication proceeds, by the cells which surround it. According to the mechanistic interpretation of the phenomena described by Driesch, the original "equipotentiality" of the cell is merely held in check by the activity of neighboring cells and by the specialization of certain cells in the growing organism. Regenera- tion occurs when the inhibitory factors are removed. We need not assume a "personal conductor" to direct the process of regeneration along its proper path; rather, the pathway opens up of itself through the removal of certain barriers. Driesch's crucial test apparently reduces to a problem of what produces the initial division of the fertilized egg cell. Is this cleav- age a physicochemical process, or can it be explained only by positing an indwelling entelechy? Here again we must await the verdict of the biochemist. But observations of crystal formation and other kindred phenomena are in line with a mechanistic explanation of mitosis. The scientist will therefore naturally assume the sufficiency of physicochemical processes as a working basis; it rests with the vitalist to demonstrate that the mechanistic explanation is inadequate to explain every step in the development and regeneration of or- ganisms.</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 39 The Mechanism, of Phylogeny.-The mechanism of phylogenetic anticipation is fundamentally the samne as that of individual growth. The separation of an egg cell from the parent and its fertilization are the first stage in the growth of a new organism. Certain physico- chemical changes are observed in this process and the burden rests upon the vitalist to point out any additional entelechial agency. But in phylogeny the anticipation reaches further into the future. Its "fulfilment" is the continuance of the species or line of individ- uals through countless generations. This involves both a mechanism for reproducing offspring similar to the parents and means for vary- ing the offspring. A species which reproduced only exact replicas of the parents would manifest a static sort of phylogenetic anticipa- tion. But as a matter of observation offspring are not exactly like the parents and their variations from parental type form the basis of phylogenetic evolution, which makes it possible for more species and more individuals to coexist. Hence, variation also is anticipatory, and we have to inquire what mechanism produces it. The experimental and statistical study of breeding beginning with Mendel's work has already carried us a considerable way toward understanding both heredity and variation. So far as these results admit of generalization, reproduction is mechanistic in character. The investigations do not, however, indicate the existence of a mech- anism for directing the line of variation toward the goal most favor- able to the species. They do not show how anticipatory results have been reached. (3) Genesis of Anticipation.-This brings us to the last strong- hold of vitalism, the problem of the ultimate genesis of organic antici- pations. The problem is twofold: (1) How comes it that anticipatory behavior mechanisms have actually been evolved-rather than mech- anisms which do not refer to the future of the creature (or species) and do not yield beneficial reactions? (2) How comes it that growth and evolution themselves are anticipatory in character, as contrasted with the general purposelessness of inorganic activity? These two problems may be treated as one: Can the origin of anticipation in behavior and growth be explained under the mechanistic hypothesis, or does it imply the action of an entelechy? Until Darwin 's time the hypothesis of a creative or directive force seemed the only admissible explanation of the origin of different spe- cies, each with organs and functions adapted to its own particular environment. It was absurd to attribute to chance these countless devices for anticipating the needs of various creatures. To recall a pre-Darwinian illustration, how many trials must be made before the poem of Paradise Lost would be built up word for word, by drawing letters at random from a bag? In those days the burden of proof rested on the biological mechanist.</page><page sequence="12">40 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Darwin's greatest claim to fame lies in his discovery of a new sci- entific canon. Before his time the only alternatives for explaining progress were "design" and "chance." He pointed out an inter- mediate alternative in "natural selection." It is to be regretted that biologists have recently shown a tendency to minimize its importance. For while Darwin's description of the process may require revision, the canon itself underlies the whole structure of modern evolution. Without it we are thrown back on a magic of chance or a mystery of entelechy. Up to the present, at least, no biologist has discovered a substitute for "natural selection." The concept of natural selection is too familiar to require any special discussion. Let us examine its bearing on anticipation. In the case of behavior our problem is to explain the origin of beneficial mechanisms, sue.h as the distant-receptors and the central nervous system. The rise of a distant-receptor through strictly physicochemical processes is quite comprehensible if we take into account the working of natural selection. If, through some chance variation, a peripheral organ appears in some creature, which is capable of being stimulated by the juices emanating from food, the creature possessing that vari- ation is at an advantage over his fellows and is more likely to survive and have offspring than the rest of the species. A pigment spot which receives light stimulations is likewise an advantage, and so in higher species is the organ for receiving auditory impressions. Such variations therefore tend to "persist," while thousands of less favor- able variations tend to "perish." Just so the evolution of a central nervous mechanism is explicable through chance variation and natural selection. The creature in whom even a rudimentary nervous pathway has been formed, will perform his reactions more readily and precisely than his fellows in whom the afferent and efferent impulses must be diffused through the whole body substance. In general, given a multitude of individuals in any species and given the possibility of variation in many directions, the creature whose variations give him an advantage over others is more likely to survive, so that his favorable variations persist. Purposive charac- ters are favorable to life. It would seem probable, therefore, that the physical and chemical processes in organisms will tend to take on a purposive character whenever variation offers an opportunity, even without the special intervention of an entelechy. So too in phylogeny. Whether the variations in the germ cells are minute or of a mutative character is a question for investigation; in any case we may presume that they originate mechanistically and not through a directive entelechy. But while species tend to vary in</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 41 many directions, only those new types tend to persist which in their general organization meet the conditions of the environment. The evolution of species directs itself; it prepares for the future environ- ment by means of physicochemical processes. Anticipatory activity of every sort, growth as well as behavior, thus appears to be explicable along mechanistic lines. (1) Organ- isms by means of chemical and mechanical processes tend to redupli- cate themselves and at the same time to vary in countless directions. (2) The variations in structure tend to persist despite changes of substance. (3) Certain of these structures and their functions, by reason of the general uniformity of natural conditions, are especially useful for the life of the organism, while other acts and growth vari- ations are useless or even harmful. Preeminent among the former are anticipatory acts and growth processes. (4) Natural selection results in weeding out those modes of behavior and lines of growth which are harmful to the organism, and in establishing those which possess a life value. This takes place through the survival of indi- viduals whose variations in form and mechanism are in the main beneficial to their possessors. These principles, taken together, seem adequate to account for the presence of the anticipation factor in organic growth and behavior. It appears unnecessary to posit, in addition, a vital force. 2. FITNESS AND ADAPTATION.-The fitness-consciousness is associ- ated with fulfilment of conscious purpose. The sense of fitness at- taches to acts or thoughts which fulfil the forethought; the sense of unfitness attaches to those which do not tally with the situation pic- tured beforehand. Now, just as there is a well-marked biological analogue to forethought-namely, anticipation-so we find in be- havior an analogue to the sense of fitness and unfitness. When the preparation-state of the muscles passes over into activity, if the reac- tion conform to that which is anticipated, the biologist and behavior- ist consider the result a fulfilment of the anticipated act; if the action be checked or imperfectly formed, the result is an unfulfilled pur- posive act. The fulfilled act is termed fit in all its parts, while the non-conforming factors in the unfulfilled act are called unfit. When we examine a complicated action, such as catching a ball, we find that a great number of simple muscular movements and ad- justments enter into the total act. The arms are raised, the elbows flexed, the palms and fingers bent, the head and eyes directed toward the ball, etc. All these movements and tensions cooperate to produce the result of catching the ball. Each is fit or suitable to the total situation. If, however, the player loses his balance, if his arms are raised too late, if the hands are placed too far to one side, or if the eyes are withdrawn for an instant, the anticipated result fails.</page><page sequence="14">42 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Any movement or inhibition which mars the coordination of the total action is said to be unfit or unsuitable to the situation. The genetic explanation of fulfilment presents no special diffi- culty. It may be accounted for in the same way as anticipation. The two are parts of one and the same continuous process. Past experience, persistence of nerve paths, and coordination of motor activities bring about both the muscular preparation and the action which follows. Through natural selection those coordinations which are most useful tend to survive and supplant less useful movements. Purposive actions, anticipated and fulfilled, tend to survive because of their special utility in the life of organisms. But the completion of an act does not always mean fitness. In the sphere of behavior, especially, the concept of fitness offers some difficulty of interpretation. Every combination of muscular adjust- ments in a coordinated movement produces some result. If I slip and fail to catch the ball, I do not perform the act anticipated; but I do perform some other coordinated act. When I try in vain to recall a forgotten name, or when I endeavor to construct a labora- tory device and fail, I live along in some fashion in spite of my failure. Even if I seek food in vain on a desert island and eventually die of starvation, I have fulfilled my life career such as it is, and the world moves merrily on without me. Is there any room in biology, then, for such a notion as unfitness? I believe there is. Biological organisms may be regarded not merely from the phys- ical and chemical point of view, but from a higher standpoint also. The living creature is a complex organization. The parts working together produce results which they would not yield separately. The growth from germ cell to adult creature means a succession of cooperative transformations. If a gross injury occurs or if the nour- ishment is insufficient, the usual growth processes are checked and the creature dies. The biological result is not attained, though the physicochemical transformations continue indefinitely. Hence, the biologist distinguishes between certain metabolic changes which pro- long the life of a creature and certain others which reduce him to a lifeless congeries of atoms. The former changes are fit or appropri- ate from the biological standpoint; the latter are biologically unfit. In the science of animal behavior a similar distinction holds. Certain muscular adjustments and movements produce results which maintain the normal life-processes-others result in a deviation from the normal. The former are classed as fit, the latter as unfit. In the lowest creatures the modes of behavior are relatively few. When a medusa moves its tentacles to and fro as the food approaches, this mode of activity serves to maintain the life processes; it is a "fit" mode of reaction.</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 43 As we ascend the scale of organic life the receptor and motor functions become more complex, and the modes of activity are more varied. When the dog snaps at an insect, the movement is deemed fit if it is adjusted to the conditions so that the insect is caught and swallowed; otherwise it is pronounced unfit. So with negative re- actions. The act of the rabbit in running away from the dog is fit so long as it results in the rabbit's escape; if the act does not accom- plish the anticipated result it is an unfit mode of behavior. The behavior of man is most varied of all. His modes of main- taining life are complex and often very indirect. Katabolism and anabolism present intricate variations in the countless forms of human work and recreation. Foresight and forethought play an exceedingly important role in man's activity. Thus the switching on of the electric light, in the example given, is part of a long and intricate process in my life. My life-sustenance is conditioned by the fact that years ago I took steps toward a professional career in psychology; that I am now reading a work which will promote this career; that the act of reading depends upon light; and that at the present moment light is to be obtained by turning the switch. The present act is judged fit in so far as it promotes the whole life process. The notion of fitness assumes a slightly different meaning in each of the evolutionary sciences. The behaviorist deals with more spe- cialized processes than the biologist. He narrows the norm of fitness from mere growth and maintenance of life to special types of ac- tivity. For example, in the case of the dog snapping at an object, the behaviorist regards the act of snapping as fit, or appropriately accomplished, if the thing snapped at is caught, whether it prove to be a nutritious object, such as an insect, or an indigestible lump of earth. Fitness, according to the behaviorist, is the completion of a typical act, the performance of a specific set of movements from start to finish. The psychologist narrows the meaning of fitness still further. The forethought is followed by a series of actions or thoughts. If the outcome corresponds to the forethought, the psychologist re- gards it as fit; or if the successive steps up to a certain point corre- spond to the progressive stages of fulfilment, he regards them as fit to this extent, whether they serve to prolong life or not. The notion of fitness, then, is based upon one fundamental cri- terion: A later event is deemed fit if it conforms in some way to a preceding forethought or anticipatory situation; and this "conform- ity" is like that in the causal relation. In other words, the final step or any intermediate step in a purposive series is judged fit or appro- priate when its functional relation to the first step is similar to that in a causal series, but with the time order of "initial" and "final" steps inverted.</page><page sequence="16">44 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The interpretation of unfitness is a corollary to this. In psycho- logical purpose forethoughts may occur which, owing to one or more unfavorable circumstances, are not fulfilled beyond a certain point. In such cases the succeeding steps are all said to be unfit. When we pass to the biological sphere, the forethought is either absent or can not be identified by the observer. Hence, in the realm of behavior and growth the criterion of unfitness is altered. Any stage in a process of behavior or growth is deemed unfit when it does not con- form to the typical purposive behavior or growth of the given species. In other words, if any coordinated activity of any species ordinarily fulfils the norm of fitness, then a deviation which leads to another outcome is called unfit so far as that particular norm is concerned. A practical difficulty in determining fitness arises here. Since "forethought" is not in evidence in growth and behavior processes, our only criterion of their fitness is the harmony or lack of harmony between some initial stage of preparation and the result which fol- lows. Now practically every creature differs from every other, and every individual act is slightly different from corresponding ones of the creature himself and his fellows. Yet these slight deviations do not always render the creature or the act unfit; on the contrary, we often consider the results more fit on account of these slight modi- fications. This apparent inconsistency is due to our inveterate habit of considering activity as a fixed, determinate process. We are apt to forget that modes of behavior are evolutionary products. It is con- venient to study an instinct or habit as a definite series of move- ments, conforming to a fixed type, just as we group together a lot of similar creatures and call them a species. But the concept of evo- lution leads to a modification of the static interpretation of species, and in just the same way we are driven to modify our static inter- pretation of action-types. The purpose of any given action is a certain typical result. For example, the purpose of the sucking reaction in the human infant is to transport nutritious substances into the digestive system; the pur- pose of fertilization is to initiate the growth of a new individual. But from the evolutionary standpoint the general purpose of organic activity is to prolong the life of the individual or the existence of the race. The whole mass of biological functions, both reactive and de- velopmental, are purposive, in the sense that they work toward this general outcome. The concept of fitness is to be interpreted, then, in a broad evolu- tionary sense. An outcome which prolongs life is "fit." If an act differs from the average in such a way as to be more advantageous to the individual, it is judged to be "fitter" than the type. Fitness,</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 45 in short, is a judgment made by the scientist, and not a quality in- herent in creatures and activities. The ultimate criterion of fitness in behavior is not the repetition of a stereotyped act; it is that the act in question leads to the prolongation of life. Similarly, the cri- terion of fitness in growth is that the process shall prolong the life of the organism or promote the continuance of the species.4 We have not merely two alternatives, fit and unfit, but a series of de- grees in fitness. Each variety of behavior (locomotion, grasping, swallowing, etc.) contributes something toward prolonging the creature's life; the life of the creature depends upon the cooperation of these func- tions. Thus one dog may be swifter of foot than another and catch the rabbit; but if his digestive organs are not so efficient as the other's, he obtains less nourishment from a given amount of food. The relative fitness of radically different types of behavior is diffi- cult to determine, for they yield no specific result in common. But individual differences in the same function are comparable; swifter locomotion, keener visual discrimination represent higher degrees of fitness, in general, than slower speed and poorer vision. It may assist our interpretation of purpose if we consider the relation of fitness to adaptation and organization. The term adap- tation has been used in several different senses: it sometimes means a " modification" of type, it is sometimes synonymous with " fitness. " The most fruitful conception seems to be a combination of these two. An adaptation is a modification of form, etc., which renders the out- come more fit. Thus we may regard a given action (e. g., a certain dog pursuing a rabbit at a particular time) as adapted if it is modi- fied from his previous mode of behavior in such a way as to accom- plish the result more effectually. Yet we should not forget that the ultimate criterion is life-value. If the same dog is chasing a skunk, any modification which will prevent him from attaining the prey is an adaptation, since the capture entails disastrous consequences. The notion of organization is to be interpreted in the same way. In general, the more highly organized a process, the fitter it is to accomplish the typical result. But at times a modification in the direction of simplicity proves fitter. Thus the adaptations of para- sites in structure and functions are generally in the direction of greater simplicity. If we consider the course of biological evolution as one ever-continuing purposive process, we may say that in the main it tends towards greater complexity because more highly or- 4 Spencer's phrase, "survival of the fittest," reverses this criterion. 'We measure the fitness of a creature to his environment by his capacity to survive. Spencer starts with an abstract quality of fitness and then argues that one who possesses it is more apt to survive.</page><page sequence="18">46 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ganized activities generally prove fitter. But complexity is not a "necessary" correlate of evolution. Purpose may work toward sim- plicity as well as toward complexity. 3. ASSENT, POTENCY, SELF.-In our analysis of purposive con- sciousness we found three other factors associated with the fore- thought: the attitude of assent, the feeling of potency in the fore- thought, and the notion of self. The feeling of potency was traced to kinesthetic sensations which accompany the purposive act, while the assent consciousness was found to be based on kinesthetic mem- ories. The associated self-notion proved least characteristic of pur- pose; it arises only from the circumstance that purposive conscious- ness always involves personal activity and kinesthetic sensations. Have these three factors any significance in the objective study of behavior? The self factor may be found in behavior generally and for the most part in growth. The anticipation and fulfilment characters of behavior are phenomena of the same individual organism. If by the self factor, then, we mean merely the fact that purposive reac- tions are carried out from start to finish by one and the same individ- ual creature, we do recognize an objective factor analogous to the self-notion in conscious purpose. But if we go further and assume that there is a center of activity from which all purposive behavior is generated, there is nothing in the objective processes to justify the assumption. Just as we found that self-consciousness is not a uni- versal characteristic of purposive experiences, that it is a late product of reflection, so the presence of a guiding self is not traceable in the process of anticipatory reactions. As for the growth processes, they are concerned with the indi- vidual organism during every stage; but they involve assimilation of material from outside the organism and dissociation of waste products from the organism. The very beginning of growth in- volves the separation of a cell from the original organism to form another individual. Thus the anticipatory character of growth is not entirely a phenomenon of the individual organism. When we examine the assent and potency data of purposive con- sciousness, we find it difficult to discover anything objective corre- sponding to them. Both of these data of consciousness rest on kines- thetic experiences. The memory of muscular contractions is an ele- ment in the state of consciousness which precedes purposive activity, as indicated by subjective report. In human behavior, therefore, an objective factor corresponding to assent may be assumed. The mental image is now generally admitted to have a physical basis in the disposition of cerebral structure. We may therefore conclude that anticipatory reaction in mankind is accompanied by stimulation</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 47 of kinesthetic traces in the brain centers. Whether any correspond- ing central antecedent is uniformly present in the behavior of lower creatures it is not easy to determine. Even in man we do not find an assent factor in consciousness accompanying the growth processes. On the whole, then, there is nothing in the data to justify us in con- cluding that assent is a characteristic mark of purpose. The sense of potency in the forethought is a vivid factor in cer- tain conscious purposive experiences. But it does not accompany simple purposive acts, and there is no consciousness of our power to grow or to heal ourselves. Hence, we may assume that the sense of potency is not characteristic of purposive phenomena. All three of these factors, then, appear to be adventitious accom- paniments of the forethought-not essential features of purposive consciousness. Regarded from the objective standpoint, the same conclusion is reached. Purposive behavior and growth do not de- pend on a guiding self, nor on a potent voluntary factor, nor on a special entelechial force. That even mechanistic biologists some- times unwittingly use these terms may be attributed to the promi- nence of kinesthetic data in human experiences of activity. But these data, as we have seen, are merely accessory elements in the purposive consciousness. The assumption that a dynamic self plays an effective part in purposive activity is based entirely on unessential features which appear in the human consciousness of purpose. This anthro- pomorphic or rather psychomorphic interpretation of teleology has served to cloud the problem of behavior by suggesting certain com- plicated hypotheses regarding a subconscious directive force. It is worth while in this connection to call attention to the in- veterate tendency of the human race to read kinesthetic elements into physical phenomena. Our usual conception of " physical force " is kinesthetic. Few of us can relinquish altogether the notion of a sensible accompaniment to force and energy. The physicist's con- cept of force and energy implies only a functional change of rela- tions. But our actual sensible experiences of force and energy are kinesthetic. Hence the tendency to a psychomorphic interpretation of force. When one billiard ball strikes another we feel that a kin- esthetic factor accompanies the impact-that one ball compels the other to move. But is not the mathematical formula of functional change a sufficient account of the event? A similar psychomorphic tendency appears in our interpretation of space and time. When we observe the interrelated masses of matter which form the physical universe, we add in thought a psy- chomorphic construct called space, in which these masses and their constituent atoms or electrons are supposed to be "contained. " So, too, when we observe objects changing their relations, we add in</page><page sequence="20">48 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY thought a psychomorphic construct called time, in which these changes are supposed to occur. It is in line with this general psychomorphic interpretation of physical events that we represent the kinesthetic accompaniment of thought as a dynamic factor capable of initiating new thoughts and acts in a manner independent of the well-known associative pro- cesses-that we-add to the process of successive association the psycho- morphic construct of volition or entelechy. One further variation of this psychomorphic tendency should be noticed. It is often assumed that the fulfilment of a purpose is due to intelligence. If by intelligence we mean trial and error pro- cedure, it is certainly true that intelligence is an important factor in attaining the end foreseen. But if we conceive of intelligence as an autonomic revealer of truth, our interpretation clashes with the actual succession of mental and physical phenomena as observed through scientific investigation. Intelligence is a function of the plasticity of nervous structure which enables a great variety of associations to be formed. This plasticity may be accounted for genetically through variations in nervous structure which have survived on account of their value in the lives of organisms. In each individual, from among the many alternative associations which this nervous plasticity renders pos- sible, those associations are established which best accord with the conditions of environment. In other words, the more intelligent or plastic a man is, the more his purposive thoughts are likely to be fulfilled. The fulfilment is not due to a directive agent within. In a certain chess problem I "see" that the inevitable result is checkmate for black in five moves. A novice at the game will fail utterly to see this result. Now while I discover the outcome only after considerable study, a chess master sees the solution at a glance. The master rejects certain alternatives at once, and reaches the re- sult of other alterniatives instantly. But it is his experience that shortens the thought process, not a peculiar "insight." He may " jump" to the conclusion-and so indeed might I, though with far less assurance. Even after long study I may overlook certain vari- ations-and possibly the master himself may overlook one alternative and hand in a faulty solution. In every case an " oversight " is due to a failure to associate, just as the representation of the successful outcome is due to the formation of the requisite associations. The central nervous structure of the chess master, and his repeated prac- tise in forming the chessboard associations, seem sufficient to account for his greater speed and accuracy in reaching the conclusion. Is it not redundant to assume a psychomorphic factor of intelligence, and attribute to it some mysterious efficiency in bringing about the result?</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 49 We conclude, then, that purpose is a real phenomenon of organic activity. There are acts which anticipate or prepare for future sit- uations. The adequacy of this objective anticipation is expressed by the biologist in a judgment of fitness, the ultimate "end" or ful- filment being the prolongation of life or the maintenance of the organic series. So far as science can determine at present the inversion of tem- poral order which marks purposive activity and growth can be ex- plained mechanistically. The assumption of an entelechy is both gratuitous and contrary to the general evidence. HOWARD C. WARREN. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. (To be continued.)</page></plain_text>
