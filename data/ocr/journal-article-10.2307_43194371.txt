<plain_text><page sequence="1">94 UNION-WIDE CONFERENCE ON ALTAISTICS AND MONGOLIAN STUDIES IN ELISTA, 1972 (From Národy Azii i Afriki, no. 1 for 1973, pp. 225-230) by N. B. Sangadžíyéva, B. D. Muniyev, and S. D. Akuginòva From the 17th to 19th of May, 1972, in Elista, the Union- wide Scientific Conference on problems of Altaic Studies and of Mongolian studies took place. The Conference was devoted to the 100th anniversary of birth of W. L. Kotwicz, the great Altaist, Mongolist, Kalmyk specialist, corresponding member of the Aca- demy of Sciences of the USSR, and active member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Taking part in its work were scientific workers of the Institute of Oriental Studies, the Institute of Linguistics, the A. M. Gor'kii Institute of World Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, as well as scholars from a number of Union and Autonomous Republics. The first secretary of the Kalmyk Obkom of the CPSU, B. B. Gorodovikov, opened the conference, and sketched in his introductory remarks the complex historical path taken by the Kalmyk people, and discussed the long-range prospects of de- velopment of the republic. The plenary session began with a report by the director of the NIIYaLI [Scientific Research Institute for Language, Literature and History] of the Kalmyk ASSR, I. K. Iliškin, "W. Lé Kotwicz and Kalmyk Studies". The speaker cast light on the services of Kotwicz in investigating language, folklore and history of the Kalmyks. G. D. Sanzheyev (Moscow) gave a report "W. L. Kotwicz,</page><page sequence="2">95 a pioneer of new directions in Altaic studies". According to the speaker, the essence of the main problem of Altaic studies comes down to explaining the reasons for communality in languages and literatures of the Altaic group. When and under what conditions did mutual influence and mutual enrichment of the language lexicon of Mongolian and Turkic peoples arise and develop? Everyone knows there are two viewpoints on this question: adherents of "orthodox" Altaistics accept the thesis about the existence of a single Altaic "Proto-language", but scholars not acknowledging the proprietry of Altaic studies as a field of linguistics, deny the genetic relationship of the Mongolian, Turkic and Manchu-Tungus languages. The speaker noted that Kotwicz founded the theory of structural-typological relationship of the "Altaic languages" and cast doubt on their genetic relationship. A report, "Nivkh-Mongol-Turkic parallels", prepared by T. A. Bertagayev and V. Z. Panfilov (Moscow), noted that the Nivkh language, conditionally included in a group of genetically diverse Paleoasiatic languages, displays not only typological traits of the Altaic languages (Mongolian, Turkic, Manchu- Tungus), but some similarities with them in the area of grammatical structure and especially of vocabulary. Along with this, the speakers consider that the Nivkh language has definite typolo- gical and material parallels with languages of South-East Asia (Chinese, Kagin, etc. ) I. Ya. Zlatkin (Moscow) gave a report on "The Problem of the Socio-Economi c History of the Mongolian Peoples", which will be found on pages 61-71 of this issue of Narody Azii i_ Afriki (No. 1, for 1973). "Janggar Studies - their current status and future outlook" was the theme of a report by A. Sh. Kichikov (Elista). The speaker laid great stress on the genetic relationships of</page><page sequence="3">96 the Janggar with ancient myths, legends, tales, and with Oirat byliny. The Kalmyk epic has quite a bit in common in episodes and motifs with the Oghuz, Altai and Kirghiz narratives. Three sections operated at the Conference: Literature and Folklore; Linguistics; and History. LITERATURE AND FOLKLORE. 19 reports and scientific communications were read. G. N. Mikhailov (Moscow), in his paper "Current problems of study in the literatures of Mongolian Peoples", among front- ranking tasks of Mongolian studies, cited an analysis of problems of traditions and innovations, the study of the masterpieces of writers, the comparative investigation of literature and folklore of Mongolian peoples, and the study of questions of mutual ac- tivity and mutual influences on literatures. A. I. Ulanov (Ulan-Ude) gave a paper on "Influence of epic traditions on the literature of Mongolian-speaking peoples". At the heart of things lies the question of man's image in folk- loristi c and literary works. The speaker, through analyzing examples from early Buriat chronicles, the Secret History of the Mongols, Geser, etc., showed the conclusiveness of the concepts of the four stages of man's image in oral popular creation. In the first level of myths and tales man is still not separated from nature; in the second there occurs a differentiation of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms, there arise and develop genres of tales about heroes, of stories about animals; in the third, man is imagined as an individuum; in works relating to the fourth level the psychology, feelings and character of man is discovered. Direct borrowings from folklore characterize the first literary works of Mongolian-speaking peoples. The first realistic depictions of man have been appearing in these</page><page sequence="4">97 literatures since the 19th century, L. K. Gerasimovich (Leningrad) read a paper "On Investi- gating Mongolian Verse through methods of experimental phonetics". A preliminary analysis of experimental material gave a basis to suppose, first, that the isochronic nature of verses is one of the chief signs of rhythmic organizations of Mongolian versification, and second, that the basis for correlation of verses is formed by isochronic syntagmas, separated from each other by intervals of tone or increase in intensity of a vowel closing or opening the syntagma. V. I. Semanov's (Moscow) paper, "On the mutual relations of literatures of Central Asia and East Asia" was based on ma- terials collected by the author during an assignment to Mongolia, and, as preliminary results of investigations prove, are very important for characterizing literary contacts of the Mongols and Chinese. "Kotwicz's interests in Tungus Folklore" was the topic of a communication by M. G. Voskoboinikov (Leningrad). Kotwi.cz played no small role in publishing folklore works transcribed by K. M. Ryčkov from the Yenisei Tungus. The speaker pointed out the need for a comparative-contrastive study of Tungus folk- lore and of the folklore monuments of Turkic-speaking Siberian- Altai nationalities. The chief emphasis in the paper by A. V. Badmayev (Elista), "On some problems of study of Kalmyk literature of the Pre- Revolutionary Period", was devoted to the composition of literature, to determine the boundaries of national literatures of Mongolian peoples, and as well to questions of the periodization of the history of literature.</page><page sequence="5">98 B. B. Okonov's (Elista) paper, "Poetical peculiarities of proverbs and sayings of Mongolian peoples", analyzed examples of aphoristic poetry and pursued the specifics of their con- struction from the viewpoint of the nature of verse, and the use of various means of artistic expression. Ts, A. Dugarnimayev (Ulan Ude) outlined the genre of "Travellings" in Buriat literature of the 19th century. The speaker surveyed the "travellings" of Damba Dorji Zayayev, of Vandan Yumsunov andi of an unknown author. The largest number of papers and communications of this section were devoted to the Kalmyk epic, the Janggar, and its comparative-contrastive historical and typological investigation. The paper by I. V. Pukhov (Moscow) contrasted the Yakut olongkho and the Janggar. Some similar events in the creations of peoples who did not in the past have historical connections, geographically distant from each other, explain in the view of the speaker that from ancient times there were "intermediaries" amongst them: some groups of eastern Mongolian tribes (e.g., the ancestors of the Buriats) and ancestors of the Altai-Sayan Turks. The differences between the epics of the Yakuts and Kalmyks the speaker was inclined to explain more by the fact that they reflect differing social relations: Janggar is early feudal relations, and the olongkho is clan structure. Pukhov presumes that many similar traits of style and episode construction of the Janggar and of the Yakut epic (description of heroic battles, dwellings, etc.) are the result of common Turco-Mongolian tradition. In his paper "Janggar and the heroic epic of the Altais" S. S. Surazakov (Gorno-Altaisk) noted that comparative-contrastive</page><page sequence="6">99 study of an epic of related peoples or of peoples neighboring at any time, by means of nearness of episodes, is far from sufficient to base any conclusion about their genetic communality. Necessary as well are comparative study of poetic detail. The speaker demonstrated the importance of this by an example analyzing some common traditional poetical formulae, characteristic both of the Janggar and of the Altai heroic epic. T. A. Guriyev (Ordzhonokidze ) presented a paper on "The problem of Ossetian-Mongolian Folklore connections". The pro- longed and multi-faceted contacts of the Alans (a mediaeval European name of the Asov-Ossetes ) with Mongolian-speaking tribes in the 13-14 centuries in the northern Caucasus and beyond its confines, the speaker maintains, had serious consequences for Alan culture. Mongolian influence is traced in the Ossetian epic. Besides this the Alans (As-Asut) played an important role in the life of Mongolia in the 13th-14th centuries, and were able to transmit elements of their folklore culture to local tribes. This is borne witness to by common elements in Ossetian tales and folklore monuments of the Mongols, Buriats and Kalmyks. "Janggar and the Russian bylina" was the topic of a paper by S. Yu. Neklyudov (Moscow). In the speaker's opinion, as bases for their typological contrast serve first and foremost genre signs of these works, compositional construction of some songs, and the type of cyclization. The speaker also discussed the actual differences between Russian byliny and the Kalmyk epic. Above all, there is the type of the "epic ruler", who appears in the Kalmyk epic as an actively functioning person, to whose adventures independent episodes are devoted, at the time when, for instance, to Vladimir of the byliny, removed from the Kievan forces both socially and locally, no independent episodes are devoted. Different too is the quantity of narra- tive mythological elements and of the "steppe historicity" of</page><page sequence="7">100 the epics. The speaker considers that the Russian bylina is contrasted to a greater degree with the Turco-Mongolian epic productions than the European (including the Slavic) narrative folklore. No coincidence either is the fact that the very name of the central personage of the Russian bylina, the bogatyr 1 , is a modification of an early Turco-Mongolian borrowing. All this, in the author's opinion, permits one to advance the cautious hypothesis of Turco-Mongolian epic influence on the bylina (in some distant period). N. B. Sangadžiyeva, who presented a communication "Janggar and the Shor Epic" assumes that the historical contacts of Mon- golian peoples with the Altai-Sayan Turks doubtlessly also left their mark on the epic compositions of these peoples. In her communication she ascertained a limited similarity of individual episodes, motifs, poetical formulae and expressions in the Janggar and the Shor epic. Sketching out the trends of genealogical cyclization in the Janggar epic, E. B. Ovalov (Elista) noted that the Janggar has a primitive observation of genealogical cyclization which is not fully worked out, in consequence of which the Kalmyk epic did not evolve along genealogical lines. In V. D. Pürveyev's (Elista) communication, "Janggar as a source of dramatic art", attention was drawn to the presence of elements of drama and theater in the Kalmyk epic. Its execu- tors, the janggarchi, played a definite role in the development of a national art of acting. A number of presentations concerned modern processes in Kalmyk literature. B. B. Ulastayeva (Elista) in her paper "The Historical Theme in modern Kalmyk literature" analyzed the problem of personality in literary genres. N. N. Musova devoted her</page><page sequence="8">101 presentation to the creation of new forms, to the phenomenon of character of the New Man (from examples of Kalmyk poetry in the 20s and 30s). R. A. Džambinova (Elista) spoke about the role of folklore in the creations of modern Kalmyk novelists. L. S. Sangayev (Elista), who in his time had attended some classes of the outstanding scholar, imparted some reminiscences of W. L. Kotwicz. The bard Z. N. Dzul'dzuyev appeared at a session of the section and rendered a narration "on the Mongolian Laikhor-Khan" . In the course of the discussions which arose the partici- pants came to the conclusion that the most important directions for future research ought to be a deepened study of the historical stages of literatures and folklore of the Mongolian peoples, of questions of their communality and national self-image, of mutual ties of literatures in various stages of their development, and of the interaction of literatures and folklore. One ought also intensively to conduct research into modern literatures of Altaic peoples, and collection and publication of folklore materials. One should speed up preparation of the Buriat epic Geser and the Kalmyk epic Janggar for publication in the series "Epics of Peoples of the USSR". LINGUISTICS: 33 reports and communications were heard in the Linguistics section. In his report, "On some ethnonyms and toponymie names in Kazakh", drawn from examples contrasting Turkic, Manchu-Tungus and Mongolian ethnonyms and toponyms, S. K. Kenesbayev (Alma-Ata) showed their importance for study of ethnic and glottogonie</page><page sequence="9">102 processes. In N. A. Baskakov's (Moscow) report, "Some Common Models of Word Formation", it was stressed that one of the pecularities of methodology in investigating Altaic languages, employed by W. L. Kotwicz, is the study of the facts of Altaic languages within their system. The speaker attempted to survey some models of word formation in Altaic languages according to their basic cate- gories. The paper by A. P. Dul* z on (Tomsk), "The Origin of Altaic Plural Indicators," pointed out the basic inadequacies of those works whose authors strove to explain the arising and development of means of formal designation of plurality purely speculatively, proceeding from the nature of the concepts expressed. Plural indicators in the Altaic (or Uralo-Altaic) languages, the author considers, can be derived only from a pre-Altaic (or pre-Uralo- Altaic) status. V. I. Tsintsius (Leningrad), in her report "On the category of possession in Altaic languages", pointed out that Kotwicz in his research on grammatical structure of Altaic directed attention to the category of possession as characteristic of Altaic languages. The presence in Altaic languages of af fixai expression of possession as well as of ownership Kotwicz connected with the fact that in these languages there are no transitive verbs with the meaning of "to have (something), to own (something)" or intransitive verbs meaning "to belong, be the property of, be in possession (of some- one)". To convey the corresponding concepts in Altaic languages, possessive affixes, and possessive or personal pronouns in the genitive case, were used. In his paper "Kotwicz and the reform of the Old Kalmyk script", D. D. Pavlov (Elista) opined that the improvement of</page><page sequence="10">103 the graphic and orthographic systems of the todo bičiq was directed at unifying the script with the living language of the Kalmyks, and that this reform brought about the necessity of removing the extant discords in orthography. Ye. I. Ubryatova (Novosibirsk) presented a paper on "Yakut reflexes of Turkic and Mongolian j, č, and s according to Radloff". U.-Zh. Sh. Dondukova (Ulan-Ude) read a paper "On some linguistic peculiarities of the Issyk-kul Kalmyks (compared with Kirghiz and Buriat ) ". M. N. Orlovskaya*s (Moscow) report, "On some grammatical peculiarities of the language of the Altan Tob či" observed that the language of this chronicle is different from contemporary Mongolian not only in style, lexicon and syntactic constructions but also in its morphology. An interesting question about the participation of Oirats in the make-up of the Buriat ethnic communality was touched on in the report of Ts. B. Tsydendambayev (Ulan-Ude), "Oirat-Mon- golian elements in the ethnic composition and language of the Buriats". The speaker came to the conclusion that Oirat elements are more widely represented in the Western Buriat dialect than in the Eastern Buriat. This position is confirmed by the ethnic make-up of Kalmyks and Western Buriats: bearers of more than ten Kalmyk ethnonyms inhabit the territory where Western Buriats dwell. As the speaker assumes, the greatest organization and most powerful group of Oirat tribes went west in the l6th-l7th centuries and formed Kalmykia, and the lesser group of Oirats nomadized at the same time to the north-east, and became a com- ponent of tribes and territorial groupings of Buriats. G. Ts. Pürbeyev (Moscow), in his paper "Forms of dual negation in Mongolian languages", pointed out that Mongolian</page><page sequence="11">104 languages have at their disposal a considerable number of con- structions or turns of phrase in which several negations occur. Two negations, used in pre-positive contact, strengthen each other, and in the remaining cases as it were are mutually neutralized and equalized. D. G. Damdinov (Ulan Ude) read a paper "Western Mongolian traits in the dialect of the Khamnigans of the Onon". In her report, "A Study of the Shira Uighur Language", B. Kh. Todayeva (Moscow) noted that the language of the Yellow Uighurs, a nationality living in the west of Kansu province in the CPR (4,000 persons in number) is Mongolian in its group and stable in this form in all levels - phonetic, morphological, syntactic and lexical. A paper by A. A. Darbeyeva (Moscow) was devoted to the relationship of vocative kinship terms in Mongolian languages. L. V. Dmitriyeva (Leningrad) analyzed names of trees and shrubs and their parts common to Turkic and Mongolian languages. A. Mollayev (Ashkhabad) read a paper, "The Dependence of The Promi- nence of the stressed vowel on its quantitative characteristics in Turkmen", and A. L. Kalyayev (Elista), a paper on "Qualitative Adjectives in Kalmyk". F. S. Tsaplin presented a paper "Ethnonymy in Altaic Studies (On the Structure of Mongolo-Turkic ethnonyms )". In his opinion the diverse ethnic names in Altaic languages are variations of corresponding prototypes, the formation of which can be derived from the Common Turkic period. In the report by P. Ts. Bitkeyev (Elista), "Palatalization of Consonants in Altaic languages" it was noted that existence of soft consonants is not peculiar to Turkic and Manchu-Tungus</page><page sequence="12">105 languages but that for Mongolian languages there is a character- istic opposition of soft consonants to hard ones. In Mongolian languages soft consonants arose through palatal dissimulation of the last vowel to the preceding consonant. B. D. Muniyev (Elista) analyzed some new phenomena in the Kalmyk lexicon. In his report, "Kotwicz and the means of action in Altaic languages", D. N. Nasilov (Leningrad) recalled that Kotwicz in his works on Mongolistics laid great stress on verbal forms expressing the peculiarity of extent of action, and as well on the fact that verbal forms in Altaic do not specify the beginning of action or conditions, extent of time, course of action itself, since these meanings are transmitted by af fixai means. Reports and communications to this section also include these : V. M. Nadelyayev (Novosibirsk), "The Role of Phonetic Data in deciding questions of Ethnogenesis". K. A. Novikov (Leningrad), "On the etymology of horse names in Altaic". T. G. Bugayeva (Leningrad), "On metal names in Altaic". V. D. Kolesnikova (Leningrad), "On names for person and appearance in Altaic". Z. G. Uraksin (Ufa), "On the question of comparative- contrative study of phraseology in Turkic and Mongolian languages". B. V. Boldyryev (Novosibirsk), "Grammatical Expression of separability in Manchu-Tungus and other Altaic languages". V. N. Tadykin (Gorno-Altaisk), "On one of the oldest means of word formation in the Altai language". U. U. Ochirov (Elista), "Structure of the complex subor- dinate clause in Kalmyk".</page><page sequence="13">106 D. A. Suseyeva (Elista), "Structural-Typological Contrast of Kalmyk and Russian in the, realm of morphological word -format i on". N. N. Ubushayev (Elista), "Ts.-D. Nominkahov's Research on Mongolian and Turkic". M. U. Monrayev (Elista), "On Dialect in Kalmyk". E. Ch. Bordayev (Elista), "Mongolian terms for sex, age and color of domestic animals". R. M. Birūkovič (Novosibirsk), "On some historical al- ternations in the Chulym-Turkic language". In the course of the discussions, questions about the reasons for appearance of related words in Altaic languages, and about the origin of the Naimans (whether Turkic or Mongolian), drew attention. Those represented noted that Altaic research by linguists was called on to aid the study of cultural-historical ties between Altaic peoples. HISTORY. 23 reports and communications were read in the section for History. L. L. Viktorova (Leningrad) pursued the basic stages of formation of Mongolian ethnic groups. The formation of a popu- lation of Mongoloid racial type she derived from the Paleolithic period, and the differentiation between the Continental and the Pacific Ocean Mongoloids, to the Mesolithic. In the Neolithic period occurred the formation of the basic ethnic groups: the proto-Mongolian, proto-Turkic and proto-Tungusi c. The bronze age and early iron age, in the ethnic development of ancestors of Mongolian tribes, are characterized by a transition from an economy of an acquisitive type to nomadic animal husbandry, which arose through the basic means of conducting economy of Mongolian tribes, and the development of the basic elements of traditional culture. The unification of all Mongolian-speaking peoples in</page><page sequence="14">107 the frame of a single feudal state in the 12th century created favorable conditions for the formation of and development of a single Mongolian people, but the campaigns of conquest of Ching- gis Khan and his successors gave new direction to ethnic processes. The final formation of Mongolian peoples occured in the l6th-17th centuries . The paper by E. A. Novgorodovaya (Moscow), "Cultural- Historical contacts of Central Asian tribes in the bronze and early iron ages", was founded on an analysis of extensive archeo- logi cal material. In the communication by N. L. Zhukovskaya, 'Western and Eastern influences in traditional Mongolian Culture", there were noted elements of western (European), Chinese, Indo- Tibetan culture, which had organically fused with Mongolian culture . I. M. Zolotareva (Moscow) read a paper, "Anthropological type of the Kalmyks in the racial systematics of the Mongolian race (in connection with the problem of origin)". The paper by G. G. Stratanovič was devoted to the problem of military organization of the triad type. The most important aspects of political organization of the union of Oirat tribes were illumi- nated in a report by G. S. Gorokhovaya (Moscow), "V/. L. Kotwicz on the Oirat Union", and in a communication by V. P. Sanchirov (Elista), "On the state of study of some Muslim sources on Oirat history". Questions of historical investigation of the Mongol-Oirat laws of I64O were treated in the communications of Ts. K. Kor- sunkiyev (Elista), "Comparative analysis of the texts of two copies of the Mongol-Oirat law of I64Ö in todo üsüq, and of V. Sh. Bembeyev (Elista), "On the first Russian copy of the Mongol- Oirat Laws of I64O and its translation".</page><page sequence="15">108 The presentations of A. M. Khazanova (Moscow), "Sarmatian- Kalmyk parallels", and of M. A. Ch'lenov (Moscow), "On the Kalmyk kinship system" had the nature of discussions. A. M. Khazanov proceeded from the position that an iden- tical or similar ecological position inevitably led to working out a single-type form of nomadic economy. As examples in the report served the Sarmatians and Kalmyks who nomadized on one and the same territory, and between whom there was no genetic tie, and who were chronologically separated by two and a half millenia and were completely different in ethnic and cultural relations. In the opinion of M. A. Chlenov, the Kalmyk kinship system is of interest for ethnographers since it belongs to the Omaha type dispersed among the American Indians, the Mongols and some other peoples. Also devoted to problems of the history of Kalmykia were these communications. A. N. Karagodina (Elista), "On the question of the social structure of Kalmyk society in the first half of the 19th century". M. L. Kichikova (Elista) "On some historiographie problems of Soviet Kalmykia in the period of the Great Patriotic War." Yu. 0. Oglayeva (Elista), "The Contribution of the workers of Kalmykia toward strengthening Soviet-Mongolian Collaboration"; and others. As the work of the section showed, a broadening and deepening of the thematics of research on the history of Mongolian peoples and peoples of the Altaic group in chronological and territorial plans is required, beginning with the era of the first great dis- tribution of labor and down to our times, from the regions of the northern Black Sea area to the steppes of East Asia.</page><page sequence="16">109 Judging the ways and means of the complex investigation of the problems of Altaic studies and of Mongolian studies, the conference noted tasks for future study by them. Noted too was the need for strengthening coordination of work of scientific institutes occupied with research on these problems, and of a wide-scale application to their solution of materials from history, ethnography, folklore, literature, linguistics and anthropology. - Translated from the Russian by John R. Krueger. COMMENTS: My thanks to Christopher I. Beckwith for telling me of this article. Note that this was strictly a USSR conference; there were no delegates from the MPR, none from the socialist countries, and none from the West. It would seem if they were able to feed and house Soviet delegates in Elista, it would now be possible for foreign scholars to visit and research there, without the frequent excuse that there are no facilities. There are many new names of young scholars in these subjects that should be noted for use in the future. It also appears that there are people in very many locations now having an interest and ability in Altaic studies. There seens to be extremely little interest in or ability in Oirat-script materials in Kalmykia. The Soviet scholars seem inclined towards wide acceptance of the Altaic theory linking the component languages. No indication was made in this article about the possibility of publishing all or part of the proceedings. - Jn. Kr.</page></plain_text>
