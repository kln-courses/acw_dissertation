<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAN K NAPP E RT The Epic in Africa The epic is one of the most complex forms of literature, oral or written. This study is an attempt to classify the various types of epic that at present are known in Africa. The term "epic" is here taken in its widest sense. What is an epic? The accepted standard examples of epic are, of course, tlae works of Homer1 and Virgil. These poets used mythological material from the folklore of their respective countries, just as, e.g., Pushkin did in R-ussia.2 Their work cannot be called folklore because it was written by individual authors who lived in an already sophisticated society. Quite diSerent is the case for Beowulf and the Russian byliny.3 They are at least partly the creation of the people rather than of the individual poets. The epic that we are looking for in nonliterate societies is part of the real folklore, the Vollcskunst, rather than individual art. The distinction is not always easy to maintain. Individual poets may use the traditional poems of the people and incorporate them in their own longer narratives, in this way providing the framework in which the smaller pieces of folklore find their place. This, for example, is how Elias Lonnrot in 1835 compiled the Kalevala from a number of separate poetic works such as the songs of Vainamoinen and Kullervo. Homer himself may have worked in this way; the poet of the Swahili Utenzi wa Muhamadi, the longest African epic, certainly did. Besides this first condition there is another: the narrative must be com- posed in the native language of the poet. Otherwise we cannot call it 1 See A. T. Hatto in his foreword to H.

The Celtic poetry recited at the court of the French-speaking kings was court poetry, no longer folklore; it was composed by individuai authors. That, of course, must not prevent us from studying this narra- tive poetry as source material of Celtic mythology. Any piece of foklore may be called "traditional.' This means that it is not the artistic expression of the ideas of an individual, but the reflection of the conventional thinking of the people. Proverbs, myths, and so on are not only traditional in form but also in content. Their significance for the people themselves, and therefore for the antllropologist, is precisely that they conform to the accepted Weltanschauung of the people which created them and kept them for regular use, that is for recitals at special occasions. Only those bards which follow the prescribed formulas and phrases without any deviations or additions can be called traditional. A poet who extends the traditional themes with inventions of his owns or leaves out essential motifs, places himself outside the tradition and sho-*s that for him the form of the story is more important than its content. For example, in Swahili literature there are five diSerent poetic renderings of the story of the Prophet's ascension to Heaven and his journey through the seven levels of the universe. Each of the poets made variations in the treatment of the whole narrative, but none of the essential parts of the story are left out by any one of them. The poems diSer in length and in meter, and the poets have considerable freedom in their descriptions and even in the order of the scenes, but for all of them it remains sacred his- tory: the historical truth of the story is not in doubt. Tedious scenes that wotlld seem to us to damage the literary form of the narrative are related by every poet in the same detail, such as the repeated requests of Mohammed to reduce the number of obligatory prayers.4 This shows that the purpose of true traditional poetry is not to produce literary beauty but to fulfill a function in the community. The poets and reciters serve their audience by satisfying a religious need. Not only form and content, but also the manner of presentation is traditional. Narratives or parts of them are normally recited only at the celebration of commemorative days as part of the festivities. There may be expert reciters entrusted with this important task. In some cul- tures only certain select persons may be allowed to hear the epic, as it may contain the secret history of the tribe. The wrong time, place, or persons 4 See Jan Knappert, "Utenzi wa Miiraji," in Afrika und Ubersee, XLVIIl (1964), 269; C. G. Buttner, Anthologie der Suaheli Literatur (Berlin, 1894), p. 47.</page><page sequence="3">173 THE EPIC IN AFRICA would endanger the ritual sanctity that surrounds the mythical narrative. In it are embedded the holy traditions of the tribe. That is why the bards or scalds have to remember these histories verbatim. Even the form in which the epic is cast may be sacred. It might be interesting to quote an example to illustrate this. I dis- covered the existence of a national epic among the Alur. Howevers it is impossible to say how long it is or how important. My informant knew only the first two lines by heart: "The Alur, the protectors of orphans, crossed the Nile / and travelled Westwards along the banks ..." I never found out why he was so reluctant to disclose more facts about this poem. The lines were clearly composed in rhythmic language but two lines are of course insufficient material for the analysis of the meter. Neither could I ascertain whether the epic was recited at public celebrations or whether any of the previous chiefs were mentioned.5 It remains difficult to decide which part of the traditional literature in a given language can be called epic, because the dividing line between prose and poetry is not sharply drawn in all languages. In other words, not all languages have a traditional poetic form distinct from prosaic style. In Hausa, Fulani, Somali, and Swahili there are clear-cut traditional criteria for poetry, i.e., there are fixed rules for the metric structure of poetry. In Runyankore and Setswana it has now been established beyond doubt that the so-called heroic recitations have a special poetic form of their own. Among other peoples, though, most of the narratives of past history and the mythical tales of heroes are recited in "bound form," yet we must probably call these prose. They are often interspersed with songs and other formulae which display a more markedly poetic form. In this respect they resemble fairy tales in which traditional songs occur. Many narratives or praises of kings and warriors from the past contain numbers of kennings or poetic epithets which in other languages occur only in epic poetry. This typical epic style is perhaps our most important criterion for the classification of narratives as epic. In this study I have brought together and briefly discussed all the references to epics in Africa that I could find. 5 "The Alur, a Nilotic Tribe in W. Uganda," unpublished material, 1961.</page><page sequence="4">174 JAN KNAPPERT ANKOLE (RUNYANKORE) The Heroic Recitations of the Bahima of Ankole by Henry F. Morris6 is one of the most important contributions to our study of epic poetry in Africa. This recent publication need not be discussed here at length. We can conclude from it that in this culture, as in most other Bantu cultures where praises occur, the praise poem is still indistinguishable from the narrative poem. It is only in Swahili that the two types are separated? to such an extent that they are normally even composed in a different meter. The Ankole poems are epic in more than one sense. They describe the deeds of heroes in the past. Often the hero is the poet himself, just as in Swahili poetry Liongo, Alii, and other heroes compose poems in praise of their own exploits. The idiom of Ankole heroic poetry is a special one reserved for this usage alone.7 Most of these poems do not survive the generation in which they were composed, but some fragments of older poems handed down orally have been preserved.8 There are two types: the ekirahiro, a poem in praise of a man's cattle, and the ekyevugo, describing a battle. The mode of recita- tion of Runyankore poems is strongly reminiscent of that of the Tswana and Zulu recitations. Each line is pronounced at great speed, after which the audience joins in with "Haa!" or a similar interjection. Remarkable is the alliteration in Runyankore of dozens of lines in many of the poems.9 Assonance and tone-rhyme are also strongly represented.10 This poetry is very much a functional part of the Ankole culture. Every well brought-up Muhima was expected to be capable of composing. BUSHONG "The Royal Epic of the Bushong" was published by J. Jacobs and J. Vansina.ll It was recorded on July 8, 1953, at Mushenge, where it was recited by the King of the Bushong at the occasion of his investiture. 6 Morris, The Heroic Recifations ... and "Praise Poems of Bahima Women," Africasz Language Studies, VI (1965), 52-66. 7 Morris, The Heroic Recitations ..., pp. 12, 26. 8 lbid., p. 13. 9 Ibid., pp. 34, 69, 73. 10 Ibid., p. 39. 11 Kongo-Overzee (Antwerp, 1956), No. 22, pp. 1-39; see also pp. 257^300.</page><page sequence="5">175 THE EPIC IN AFRICA During the declamation, the king, seated on his throne, beat several times on a bell-shaped gong with a sword, as if to mark the end of a paragraph. All the dignitaries and notables of the realm were present at the occasion. The epic is traditionally recited during coronation ceremonies and is designed to remind the Bushong people that their kings are of divine ori- gin. It relates very briefly the history of the Bushong people and how they arrived in their present habitat after many vicissitudes. In this history the exploits of their divinely inspired monarchs form the main the1ne. The text contains a number of words which are said to be not Bushong but Lambil, an archaic language that was once the language of the court. The king recited the epic in the first person pluralt identifying himself with his ancestors and his people whose history is so closely linked with that of their kings. The text is in prose, consisting mainly of an enumera- tion of names of places, rivers, and the like, where the people were tem- porarily settled or along which they travelled. The style is epic; it contains many kennings that accompany the proper names. Refrains in dialogue form interrupt the recital which is concluded by ovations from the people. Perhaps this is a national epic in its very oldest form? FULANI There is epic poetry in Fulani, but very little has been published about it yet. Dr. D. Arnott kindly drew my attention to a passage in Henri Gaden's Proverbes et Maximes Peuls et Toucouleurs12 where mention is made of a kasida this term usually means a praise poem in honor of the Prophet Mohammed-which relates the life of E1 Hadi Omar. We do not know the length of the poem but from the two lines cited by Gaden one would conclude that its contents are narrative rather than homiletic. Leo Frobenius collected eighteen troubadour stories in his "Spielmanns- geschichten.''l3 He also mentions the "Book of Heroes of the Fulbe" which was called the Baudi.l4 Frobenius reproduces all these stories in a literary German prose rendering. He does not state whether the original is in poetry, though he repeatedly refers to the recitation of these narra- tives as "singing." Frobenius does not mention either whether the "Book 12: Institat d'Ethnologie (Paris, 1931), p. xviii. 13 "Spielmannsgeschichten der Sahel," in Atlantis (lena, 1921), pp. 168-228. 14 Ibid.,p.166.</page><page sequence="6">176 JAN KNAPPERT of Heroes' was written in Arabic script or even where he saw it. He does mention that he obtained important parts of the Baudi in manuscript form.15 Frobenius deals at some length with the bards of the Fulbe as "carriers of the old epic art."l6 There were two classes of these bards, the noble mabo (pl. mabobe) and the commoners, the minstrels for the lower classes (gaulo, pl. czrulube). The heroes themselves sang the beiti, accom- panying themselves with the hoddu (pl. kolli), the guitar, of which a picture is given.l7 They sang of the exploits of their forefathers on the eve of battle, ;'when the guitar was passed around from hand to hand." The gaulo sang the gumala, battle songs of a simpler type. The mabo sang the epics (baudi or maboide).18 The contents of these epics seem to have been conventional: a knight rides out, accompanied only by his shield-bearer-poet, the mabo. In a series of brave battles he acquires a princess and/or a kingdom. The story of Goroba-Dike19 is a typical example of this traditional epic poetry. In 1965, Pierre-Francis Lacroix published an anthology of Fula poetry from the Cameroun.20 All the poems are recent, written since 1929. All have been written in Arabic script and are iIltended to be recited. Some of these are narrative and describe events in the past, mostly in order to praise a chief, e.g., the poem about the famine.21 All the poems in this collection are short, few being longer than fifty stanzas. Their length, limited scope, and simple structure would seem to place them outside the category of the true epics. HAUSA A long Hausa epic, the "Song of Bagauda a Hausa Kinglist and Homily in Verse," was recently published by Mervyn Hiskett.22 Though the opening lines are almost literally the same as in some Swahili epics,23 the 15 probeniuS, p- 41. 16 Ibid., p. 39. 17 Ibid., facing p. 41- 18 Ibid., p. 40. 19 Ibid., pp. 171-179. 20 Poesie Peule de l'Adamawa (Paris, Juillard, 1965). 21 Ibid., pp. 114-123- 22 Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies [BSOAS], I, XXVII, 3 (1964), 540-567; II, XXVIII, 1 (1965), 112-135; III, XXVIII, 2 (1965). 23 BSOAS, XXVIII, 1 (1965), 112-113.</page><page sequence="7">177 THE EPIC IN AFRICA contents of the "Song" are entirely different from anything found in Swahili to date. The "Song" is a history of Hausa kings in verse form. It is beyond doubt an epic, not only because of the meter, but also because the narrative style and the fact that it embodies the history of a people make it truly epic in function. It was found to have been preserved as an oral tradition as well as in manuscripts in Arabic characters. The poem is not the work of any one person but has been gradually added to in the course of several generations.24 These old traditions are still recited by beggars. Only 736 lines in length, it is not a long epic, if compared with Swahili poems. Its interest lies in the fact that it relates Hausa history. Another collection of long verses in Hausa was published as early as 1896 by Ch. H. Robinson.25 Their contents are not epic but didactic. The poet admonishes his people to lead a pious life of praying and fasting and not to indulge in dissipation because the fire of Hell is awaiting the sinner and the gate of Paradise is open for the God-fearing. LUBA The tales of Kabundi were published in 1938 by the Rev. R. Van Caeneghem.26 Fr. Van Caeneghem quotes several collections of similar folktales strung together around the figure of the "roguish animal" usually the hare, sometimes the mongoose or the marten. Though the Kabund; cycle is not in verse, its prose is certainly in a bound form. A curious epic feature in these stories is the frequent occur- rence irl them of the epithets of the animals. Especially Kabundi himself, the pine-marten, is referred to by many different kennings, such as "the fat one" (because of his ability to find food anywhere).27 How are these stories told? Fr. Van Caeneghem gives a lively account of what may happen after the evening meal in Kasai: When the tobacco pipe has gone round, the people rise and go to the yard of the best story- teller in the village. If the moon shines, they sit outside; if it is rainy, they creep inside for fear of snakes. A fire is then laid, around which all sit down.28 24 Ibid., XXVII, 3 (1964), 540. 25 Specimens of Hausa Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1896). 26 Kabundi Sprookjes (Brussels, Vromant, 1938). 27 Ibid.?PP-17?155- 28 Zbid.,pp.10-11.</page><page sequence="8">178 JAN KNAPPERT The stories are both told and acted out with lively gestures. Every animal is introduced with its proper intonation and timbre of voice. Sometimes the storyteller will pause to ask a question which will suggest a particular word that the audience must shout out at him. For instance, Kabundi has eaten the food of the other animals. They have tried him and found him guilty. The narrator asks "Must he die?" The people shout out, "Wafua!' ("He must die"). The stories are usually known to the listeners. Songs occur frequently in them, and the audience is supposed to join in. This cycle of stories around a central figure could not be called an epic, since it is not in verse, btlt it is very similar in content to the cycle of animal stories about the hare in Tsonga, which is in verse.29 MALlNKE-SONINKE Frobenius, in his "Spielmannsgeschichten,'? describes the contents of another i'Book of Heroes," the Dausi of the Soninke people.30 ln it he sees the reflection of the tradition of a long migration of the Soninke from northeast Africa to their present habitat. Wagadu was the name of their empire. Four times it existed in full glory, four times it fell to dust? the first time through the wrath of the hero Gassire, the second time because of the greed of the people, the third time by a breach of faith! the fourth time through discord. Frobenius does not give any details about the form of the epict its language, or the manuscripts he obtained. Not a single specimen line is given. Frobenius identifies the Soninke with the Sarrakole or Marka but not with the Malinke.3-l Diczlli, "bards," are fotlnd among the Malinke; they sing the Mara Szmjata of which the largest part was secured by Frobenius,32 bllt he published only a Germarl summary of it.33 The Niaule epic is even older than the Sunjata. 34 The epic poems were still i'sung" by bards in the days of Frobenius, preferably on festive occasions. 29 The similarity in theme between South African and West Germanic folklore 11ad already been noticed by W. EBleek in his Reynard the Fox in South Africa (London, 1864). 30 Leo Frobenius, ;'Spielnzannsgeschichten der Sahel," loc. cit. 31 Ibil., p. 35. 32 Ibid., p. 36. 33 Atlantis, Vol. V. 34 Zbid., Vol. Vl, 231-246.</page><page sequence="9">179 THE EPIC IN AFRICA In 1960, D. T. Niane published a work, Soundjata ou IEpopee Man- dingue,35 which Jacobs compares with the history of the Zulu King Chaka.36 In his introduction, Niane writes that he is only the translator and owes all his knowledge to some griots, whom he describes as men of great knowledge, the historians of the Mandingo people. However, we do not learn whether they recited their histories in poetry or in prose. Not a line of verse is given as an example of the texts. Though Niane calls the story an epic, he presents it to the French reading public in the form of a historical novel. These narratives appear to be part of the oral traditions of the Mandingo people of Guinea; Niane makes no mention of a written text but tells us that the whole text is stored up in the memory of the bards. Though we cannot decide on formal grounds whether Sunjata was an epic or not, it is interesting to note some strikingly epic features: When Sunjata is born, the thunder rolls and lightning flashes. The boy Sunjata is slow to develop; he does not walk at the age of seven. At eight, however, he suddenly grows into a strong man and when his mother asks for some breadfruits he brings her the whole tree.37 NKUNDO The best known epic cycle of Bantu Africa is found in the legends of Lianja, the national hero of the Nkundo in the Congo Basin.38 The text of the whole cycle has been published by Rev. E. Boelaert.39 It is in prose interspersed with many songs and other verses. Fr. Boelaert writes in his introduction: ;'In general the epic is sung at night, round the fires. One must have been present at these vigils to understand the real signiIScance of poetry for this people.'40 When the narrator is invited to come and recite, he appears in grand attire, face and body painted in asymmetrical figures, a cap with plumes on his head and a lance in his hand. He is accompanied by a choir of men or women who sit down around him and join in with the songs and refrains which illustrate every new passage 35 Paris, Presence Africaine, 1960. 36 Aequatoria, XXV, 4 (1962), 121. 37 Many great epic heroes were slow to develop: Parsifal, the Russian Ilya Muromets, Helgi in the Edda.

The whole town comes to listen and follow the legendary gestes, the miraculous exploits of the national hero. One story deserves to be quoted here, "The Birth of Lianja.''4l When Lianja's father is killed, his mother is pregnant with him. When her labors begin, she sings: "Pain is drilling my lap but I do not lament!" When the delivery begins, she first brings forth insects such as flies, bees, wasps, and many others. Previously there had been no insects in the world, but when Ilele, Lianja's father, died, worms, ants, and maggots crept out of his dead body.49 After that, Nsombe, Lianja's mother, brings forth six people, then a girl, Nsongo; then she stops. Presently the people hear the voice of a man, speaking from his mother's womb, asking: "Mother, where shall I come out?" The people answer: "Don't you see where your fellows came along? Are you not coming the same way?5' He says: ';I am not coming along where all have passed, find me another way!" When they tell hirn there is no other way, he replies: "Take the white clay that belonged to my father and apply it to my nzother's shin so that I may come out along the shin of this woman.'5 They do as he says and look at the shin of the woman, which soon swells up. Lianja comes out fully armed with his father's spear, knife, staff, horn, arrows, and bracelet. With them, he goes out to avenge his father.43 RWANDA All we know about the epic in Rwanda stems from one author, Abbe Alexis Kagame, the well-known Bantu scholar, who is also a poet in Kinya-Rwanda. One of his few published works in his own language is "The Springs of Progress,"44 a didactic epic in thirty-one cantos with a total of 5,856 verses. It celebrates the dynasty of the kingdom of Rwanda, the baptism of King Charles Mutara, and the Christianization of the country. This is certainly an epic; the author himself fondly calls it a i'Ruandiade." It is composed of stanzas of four lines each, the lines having between ten and twelve syllables. It is possible that more accurate data about vowel length and coalescence will show in the end that the metrical system is more rigid. Another epic by the same poet is Umulirimbyi was Njili-ibirembwa (The Bard of the Master of Creation) which he himself translated into 41 E. Boelaert, Lianja Verhalesa5 Ekofo Versie (Tervuren, BelgiumS 1957)^ p. 15. 42 Ibid., p. 13; Lianja Verhalen, II, 109. 43 Ibid., p. 19. Compare this story with that of the Zulu hero Uchakijane. 44 Isoko y' amajyambere (Kabgayi, 1949-1950).</page><page sequence="11">181 THE EPIC IN AFRICA French and published under the title La Divine Pastorale.45 This epic is divided into 150 cantos. (Likewise there are 150 psalms.) The epic describes the creation, the fall of Lucifer, and other episodes from religious history, in which Catholic symbolism is partly mixed with African imagery. For the purpose of our present study, the most relevant work of Fr. Kagame is La Poesie Dynastique,46 in which he gives a summary descrip- tion of his collection of what he calls "dynastic poems" which totals 175 items. Fr. Kagame gives a list of first lines and some translations of long passages in French. These poems, it appears, are remarkably similar to those found in Ankole, only the Rwanda poems are more elaborate than the Ankole ones and give more historical details, all in the form of allusions. Unfortunately, Fr. Kagame does not give a single piece of text as a specimen of the metrical form. These poems are in the first place praises in honor of kings past and present. Historic accuracy as well as the narrative continuum are sacrificed to the purpose of eulogizing, so that only some passages are narrative, but epic epithets occur frequently. In Rwandaland there was a "Corporation of Poets" to which access could be obtained by outstanding merits in this art, or by descent from any man who had meritoriously composed in the past. The "Corpora- tion" was led by a president, a senior poet who was reponsible for the preservation of important poems from the past. If the occasion arose he would be called upon by the court to find a bard who could remember them verbatim and would be capable of reciting them before the king. Poets are known to have received several cows as a reward for the com- position of one poem in honor of their monarch. SONGAI In Songai we have a large collection of epic poetry with complete text in the original language plus translation, 303 pages in all, by M. A.

The lines are short (three to eleven syllables). Owing to the imperfect notation it is impossible to investigate the meter. No details are given about methods of recitation. Mousas mother goes to sleep under a tree. A tree-dwelling spirit descends from the branches and has intercourse with her. She conceivess and when a boy is born, they call him Mousa (Moses) "because we do not know his father." Later Mousa meets his spirit-father who teaches him magical formulae. When the Hira appears, a hideous monster that "exhausts" the countryside, Mousa is the one who has to slay it. He accomplishes this feat in company with his fiancee who is equally coura- geous and well versed in magic. After they have disposed of the monster, he tries to tie her with chains but she breaks them. Finally, when he has made a magical chain which she cannot break, she consents to marry him. Later? a second Hira appears. A diviner is called who reveals that it can only be killed with the help of the chief's girl friend who is in secret a female elephant. She goes and changes herself into a female Hira and lies down near a pond to sleep. When the big male Hira comes to drink he sees her and begins licking her. She wakes up and snatches four hairs from his tail. The next day, Mousa merely has to show these hairs to the monster itself. The Hira lies down and lets itself be killed. SWAHlLI The language with the most extensive epic literature in Africa is Swahilio So far, the titles of seventy long epic poems are known though not all the texts have yet been brought to light. Only a fraction of this material has been published. The shortest of these epics have about 150 stanzas (each stanza has four lines); the two longest epics are Rasi l'Ghuli and Muha- madi, the former having over 4,300 stanzas, the latter, over 6?200. These two are the longest epics ever written in an African language. All these narratives are beyond question epic: they are written in a rigid metric form and in a very special poetic dialect with numerous phrases and expressions that are typica] for epic poetry. Some of these epics are customarily recited at special occasions, such as the celebration of a wedding or the nativity of the Prophet Mohammed. Most of them have been written dowrl at some stage in their history in Arabic script; some in</page><page sequence="13">183 THE EPIC IN AFRICA more recent times, in Roman, but Arabic script is still largely preferred. Many of these epics are still memorized so that one could still record them on tape. One motif may be quoted here, as it seems to be widespread in different forms in epic literature all over the world. The short epic Utenzi wa Liongo Fumo (The Epic of King Liongo) was written down in Lamu shortly before the First World War. It is well known in Mombasa. Liongo was king of Ozi in the Tana Delta, possibly in the late Middle Ages. Legend has it that he was invulnerable, i.e., he could be killed only in one way: by a copper needle introduced into his navel.48 This was known only to his mother. Liongo marries the daughter of the king of the Galla tribe which is invading Swahili country. Liongo the mighty hero is the only warrior who can lead the Swahili successfully into battle against the heathen Galla. The Galla king therefore wisely decides to marry oF his daughter to Liongo, hoping to bind the formidable enemy with family ties. One son is born of this marriage. When he comes of a^,eo he is instructed by his maternal grandfather to go and find out how his father can be killed. The son then goes to Liongo to elicit the secret under the pretext that he wants to protect his father where he is most vulnerable. Liongo perceives the evil schemes of his son and is so dis- mayed at his discovery that he decides to tell his secret rather than live with a treacherous son. A concubine of Liongo is made an accomplice; she puts away the weapons of Liongo when the king is asleep. His son then kills Liongo with a copper needle, as prescribed. Dying, the hero king rises from his couch and walks out of his palace, taking his bow with him. On the beach, near a well, he sinks down on one knee and strings his bow. There, finally, he dies. No one dares approach the well until his mother is called. She comes and when she is near him she sees that he is dead, sitting like an archer with an arrow pointed towards the north, in the direction of the Galla country.49 The most interesting motif in this story is the struggle between a father- 48 The French hero, Ferragus, was also vulllerable through the navel only; see de Vries, Heldenlied Mnd Heldensage, p. 199. 49 For accounts of the history of Liongo, see Edward Steere, SwaSlili Tcxles (Lolldon, 1906), p. 439ff; Alice Werners 'iThe Swahili Saga of Liolago Fumo,' BSOAS, IV (1925-1928), 247-255, and "A Traditional Poem Attributed to Liongo Fumo," Fest- schrift Meinhof (Hamburg, 1927), pp. 45-54; Lyndon Harries, Swahili Poetry (Oxford, 1962), pp. 48-71; my own edition of the text (Dar es Salaam, E.

It is the Russian saga of llya Muromets which comes closest to our story: The son Sokolnichek, "The Young Falcon," after having learned that his father seduced his mother in the open field, rides out to take revenge for his mother's honor. He finds his father asleep, and hits him with a spear. But instead of piercing his father's breast the weapon hits a miraculous metal cross. The old hero wakes up and kills his son with his own hands. Liongo is the only hero who is actually killed by his son. The stories of Liongo and Ilya Muro- mets have two points in common which they do not share with other versions of the father-son motif: (1) The son knows his father. (2) He sets out to kill his father on purpose. Also, the son is on the side of his mother? though this motif is also present in the history of Sohrab who belongs to his mother's tribe, the Turks. The epic as we have it today is presumably only a fragment of the total epic of Liongo. [t contains several episodes, including the death of Liongo, but very little about his early history, nothing about his birth, his exploits in war, his marriage, or how he became king. Liongo still plays xan important part in the oral traditions of Africa's East Coast. It should be noted that there is a special type of dance called gunguv55 in which songs are sung that are said to have been composed by Liongo 5° Bernhard Heller, Die Bedeutu7ag des Arabischen Aeltar-Romans fur die Vergleichende Literaturku7zde (Leipzig, 1931), pp. 81-88. zl de Vries, Heldenlied und He/:deslsage, p. 53. 52 de Vries, "Das Motiv des Vater-SohnkampSes inl Hildebrandtslied," Germanisch- Romarlische Monatschrift, XXXIV (1953), 257-274. 53 Boris Raptschinsky, Russische Heldensagen und Legendesl, p. 341. Raptschinsky draws attention to an interesting feature of the Russian saga: the son of Ilya Muromets may be called Sokolnik "Falconer" in some versions, but in others he has names that seem to indicate that in an older layer of the saga the son represented the powers of darkness which attack the hero in his sleep. We are involuntarily reminded of the Greek myths of Uranos, Chronos, and Zeus, in which the son murders his father and the father devowrs his chi]dren. Liongo also reminds us of Samson, the Hebrew hero, who fought the enemies of his nation valiantly before a woman made him powerless. 54 See the Shahnama of Firdausi, tr. A. and E.

These songs indicate that his epic may have been both longer and older than the one we know. It does not relate all that can be found in oral tradition about him. Apart from the epic of Liongo which stands apart, all the motifs of Swahili epics can be traced to Oriental sources. One of the most remark- able examples of this relationship is the short narrative poem of Moses, the Pigeon, and the Falcon.56 The origin of this story can be tracked via Arabia to India.57 Similar stories are found in Chinese, Hausa, and Spanish.58 The kernel of the story is as follows: A pigeon comes flying down in great hurry and perches on the shoulder of a king (or Buddha, or Moses). lt begs the king to protect it against its enemy, the falcon. The king promises to protect it and hides it in his robe. Down swoops the falcon to ask the king, "Have you seen a pigeon?3' "Yes," says the king. "It is under my personal protection." The falcon complains, "God has created me to eat pigeons. If you keep my food from me I shall die!" The King feels that he cannot deliver up the innocent pigeon, and that he must protect it, if need be with his own body. However, the falcon has a right to food. Did not God create pigeons to be eaten by falcons? He decides to give the falcon a piece of his own flesh to eat instead of the pigeon. He draws his sword and lifts it to cut off a limb. At this moment the two birds change into two heavenly beings, the archangels Gabriel and Michael, or the Hindu gods Indra and Dharma, respectively. In one of the Swahili epics a caravan is about to make camp in a valley when a snake arrives and tells them not to camp there because a flood will soon inundate the valley. The snake appears to be a friendly spirit. One would be inclined to suppose that this motif, if any, is African, the more so since in Zululand snakes are thought to be the incarnations of deceased ancestors and even kings.59 Nevertheless, Wellhausen shows that in pre- Islamic Arabia snakes could be spirits, wicked or kindly; they could predict the future and speak to people in the wilderness.60 56 Ernst Dammann, "Eine Suaheli Dichtung uber Mosess den Habicht und die Taube," Zeitschrift fur Ei.ngeborenensprachen, XXVIII (1937), 1. 57 Dammann, op. cit., p. 13; Somadeva, the Kathasaritsagara, tr.

One is in prose, Slrivongo s"n Mclchangana (The Praises of the Machangana).6l The Machangana are the royal clans of the Southwestern Tsonga. This work contains lists of kings and other prominent members of their families. Some of these kings were so illustrious that the praises in theil honor have been preserved and are added to their names in the lists. The work is, in factS a complete history of those sections of the Tsonga people that were ruled by the Machangana. Apart from the praise names, with their typical linguistic forms, this work could not be called epic and hardly narrative, but we may consider this type of history as the first stage of a development that might grow into a true epic, if the circumstances are favorable. The other Tsonga narrative is Nwcz;-Mpfudla N;rna Xisana (The Romance of the Hare), in which Mr. Hare (Nwa-Mpfundla) is the pro- tagonist, the perpetrator of a long list of cunning tricks against his fellow animals.62 The whole work is in verse though the meter of the poems varies. There are many striking points of similarity between these stories and the Flemish Reinaerd de Vos (Mr. Clever, the Fox), a long epic, all in verse, from the early thirteenth century, in which the fox deceives his fellow animals in an equally merciless fashion. I could not find out whether any of these oral traditions were still being declaimed in a special manner or on specific occasions. TSWANA Praise Poems of Tswana Chiefs is another important collection of Bantu poetry, published by 1. Schapera.63 This eulogistic poetry is certainly heroic in the same way as that published by Dr. Morris for the Ankole language. Dr. Schapera shows in his introduction that there are three or four arses in every line and that one of them always falls on the penulti- mate syllable.64 Most of the lines in these poems have either eleven or twelve syllables, so that we can observe here another feature that brings 61 Pub. by Rev.

Another epic feature of these praise poems is the use of parallelism the repetition of the meaning of the previous line, in other words.65 Other poetic characteristics found in Tswana praises are chiasmus and linking66 Yet we could not call these poems narrative. The ingenious romantic devices of Swahili narrative, such as in the Rasi l'Ghuli,67 are not found elsewhere in Bantu Africa. Tswana praise poems are not meant to tell a story even when they are intended to be historical.68 These praises are recited by initiates about themselves during certain ceremonies, and, more often today, on the occasion of special festivities such as weddings, in praise of important personages. Most of the praises quoted by Schapera relate the exploits of great chiefs in the past. ZULU In Zulu there are poems that describe historical events. B. W. Vilakazi classifies them with the izibongo, the praise songs in which history serves only as a background for the praises of the king.69 This applies to many "historical" epics; the reality of the historical events is of less importance than the glorification of the nation, its kings and their vic- tories.70 Many of the great events of history are merely alluded to and not actually narrated, which is typical of epic traditions. The audience is supposed to know the story. The people come to hear only the lyrical paraphrases of the poets on the well-known episodes of history the actual course of events is supplied by memory or told in the form of stories of yore. The most important published collection of praise songs is the one by E. W. Grant.7l This collection contains the praise songs in honor of all 65 lbid.,p.19. 66 Ibid. 67 Personal research. 68 Schapera, pp. 12-15. 69 "The Conception and Development of 7:ulu Poetry," Bantu Studies, XII (1938), 105ff. 70 Ibid.,p.118. 71 "Izibongo of the Zulu Chiefs," Bantu Studies, III (1927-1929), 205-244.</page><page sequence="18">188 JAN KNAPPERT the Zulu kings of the nineteenth century in order of their succession. Some of these poems are more then eighty lines long. They deal in very condensed form with a century of Zulu history. They are composed in a special type of poetic idiom, with praise names that often form long compound words. These factors certainly make them epic poetry though the narrative passages are not especially prominent. The non-Zulu listener or reader needs an explanation for almost every line. In the sphere of the animal fable there is in Zulu the cycle of Uthlakan- yana or Uchakijana, the weasel or mongoose, who is also a very cunning man w3io tricks his fellows.72 Like Lianja, he spoke to his mother before his birth: "Mother give birth to me at once, the cattle of my father are devoured by the people.'73 The father said: "Let all go out of the house; give birth to him that we may see whether it is a man or not." As soon as the child was born, he stood up. His mother said: "Come here and let me cut off that which is hanging from you." The child said: "No, I am going to cut myself, I am grown-up [mdala], :1 am a man of the council." He took his father's spear and cut himself and threw it down. His mother took water and washed him. He went out with the spear into the cattle kraal. He sat down by the fire and ate a strip of meat.74 Note the striking similarity of this motif with the story published by J. Carnochan in this issue, where we find the same ambiguity regarding the human and animal nature of the hero. CONCLUSIONS Though the epic is found in many parts of Africa, its occurrence seems to be accidental, and only in a few places do we find the true epic in form and content. There are the following types: A. Bantu 1. The collections of animal fables, sometimes wholly or partly in verse form (Luba, Zulu, Tsonga), areremarkablysimilarto the Flemishepicofthe Fox Reynaerde. There is sometimes a curious transition from therio- morphism to anthropomorphism in these cycles; the cunning animal 72 CanonCallaway, Nursery Talesl TraditionsandHistoriesoStheZulcls in Their Own Words, with a Translation into English (Pietermaritzburg and London, 1868). 73 Ibid., p. 3. 74 Ibid, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="19">189 THE EPIC IN AFRICA assumes human features and begins to show qualities of a national hero, an African Ulysses, like the one described by Carnochan in his contribu- tion. 2. The cycle of legends about the hero and mythical forefather (Nkundo). Though we find this type only occasionally among the Bantu, it may well be one of the oldest types of African folklore. The motif of the baby boy who speaks to his mother in utero and orders her to give birth to him is linked up with the cycle of animal fables in both Zulu and Igbo, though in Luba we find only traces of the anthropomorphic nature of the marten Kabundi, and in Nkundo we find only traces of the animal nature of Lianja. 3. The third genre of Bantu epic or semi-epic folklore is the praise poem, in its typical form found only among the cattle-herding Eastern and Southern Bantu, the Nyankore, Rwanda, Soto,75 Tswana, and Zulu. The epic features of these praises are: (a) Narrative episodes, with a historical or quasi-historical background. (b) Epic style (the occurrence of kennings, i.e., traditional honorific epithets of a peculiar linguistic structure). (c) Poetic form. These praises are composed in a definite verse form consisting of lines with a maximum length, a given number of stressed syllables, alliteration, assonance? and sometimes tonal rhyme. (d) Epic function. It is sung or recited by expert bards at special ceremonies, sometimes exclusively at the royal court. B. Myths of origin 1. The :rnyth about the origin of the tribe may have been cast in an epic or semi-epic form, such as the Bushong have it, to be recited only on the occasion of the coronation, with participation of the audience at given intervals. 2. We know too little about the epics of the Soninke and Malinke to be able to analyze them in terms of form and content, because we have only some drastically reduced summaries; about the form we know nothing at all, except that these epics can be sung, which probably means recited to traditional melodies. 3. The Hausa "King List," the Song of Bagauda, is of an entirely different nature. It shows that the Hausa are culturally on a level of their own and cannot be classed with the other African peoples. 75 Personal information from Dr. D. Kunene.</page><page sequence="20">190 JAN KNAPPERT C. The Islamic Epic The Islamic epic is found in several Islamic cultures in Africa but we still know very little about it. The only language in which it has come to full development is Swahilie These epics are poetic narratives which deal with several of the episodes from the sacred history of Islam. Others describe events from what we would call mythology, but which for the pious Muslims are no less historical events. In these stories numerous motifs from various Oriental sources have been incorporated. The study of the motifs of the Islamic 1iteratures of Africa takes us out of Africa proper and to the Orient.
