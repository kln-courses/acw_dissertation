Central to the subject is the engineering concept of feed- back. To illustrate this, consider an incubator which we wish to keep at more or less constant temperature. Suppose it is heated by gas and that a small balloon lies in a portion of the gas pipe that is inside the incubator. When the incubator warms up, the balloon expands and thus blocks the pipe more than previously; this checks the flow of gas and thus cools the incubator; then the balloon contracts and allows more gas to flow, so that the incubator warms up again. By such means the temperature oscillates round a central value; and, if the mechanism is finely adjusted, deviations of temperature will not be noticeable. The 1 See e.g. J. O.

WISDOM. temperature is then steady-for practical purposes constant. This comes about by using the balloon mechanism, which is a thermostat, to control the input. Thus the thermostat utilises some of the output to work the mechanism that controls the input: it feeds part of the output back into the input-control. What is fed back may, as here, diminish the input, or may increase it, so that the feed-back may be either " negative " or " positive ". With the different types of feed-back mechanism, however, we are not here concerned. An artifact2 that contains appropriate feed-backs is a self-correcting artifact: it is continually correcting small errors. Thus it is in a sense " adaptive." For present purposes I will assume the neurological hypothesis that feed-back mechanisms occur in the central nervous system and explain-or play a fundamental r61le in explaining-" adaptive " behaviour. Other known physio- logical mechanisms are not excluded. A particularly important use of feed-backs is to provide scansion mechanisms, which are required, for instance, in current forms of television and radar. They scan an object as one might scan a printed page in search of some word backwards and forwards across the page and from top to bottom. A special case of feed-back occurs when a circuit is closed, so that an impulse applied at an initial point passes round the circuit and renews the impulse at the initial point. In such a " reverberating circuit " or " regenerative loop " an impulse once given may continue circulating endlessly. ? 2.0 Prejudicial Considerations. The best example for present purposes of a self-regulating artifact is a certain kind of radar apparatus, which keeps itself focused on a moving target. Predictive behaviour also appears here, for guns fired in conjunction with the radar apparatus must aim not at where the target is but at where 2 I follow Dr. MacKay in speaking of" artifacts " rather than " machines " though mainly for a different reason: if human beings are in some sense machines, it is best to use " artifact " for things constructed in non-biological laboratories.</page><page sequence="3">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES 3 it is going to be-the path of the target has to be extrapolated -and the radar apparatus lays its guns accordingly. Such striking phenomena are bound to suggest all sorts of speculations about the possibility of constructing robots. It is therefore desirable to mention things that are likely to sway us, however irrationally, at the outset of such investiga- tions. By means of a mechanism for scanning, the radar instrument can adapt itself to changes in the course of an aeroplane, and my eye can follow the movements of a hen. This would suggest that radar is like an eye. But it would also suggest that there is no mental process involved in watching. And here we might become critical: usually when my eye follows the hen it is because I want to watch the hen, and if I do not want to do this I need not; but there is no question of radar " wanting " to track the aeroplane. Thus we get the opposite suggestion that radar is quite different from deliberate observation. The baffling behaviour of cats may induce one to think that no artifact could display cat-like behaviour. For instance many cats will eat food they steal that they would not deign to touch when it is on their menu. How could this be reproduced in an artifact ? The question easily becomes rhetorical and the negative answer assumed. On the other hand, devices of photo-electric cells, as in the mobile artifacts known as " tortoises " which were built by Walter3, could make an artifact avoid doing something when " seen " that it will do when not " seen." The sort of attitude one might well bring to bear on the subject is that living things are so complex that no artifact could reproduce them in all their variety, and that some living things are so whimsical that an artifact could behave at best only like someone living in accordance with extremely fixed habits. Put another way, one may consider that an artifact can never be more than an automaton, and that human beings certainly, and animals probably, are not automata. 3W. Grey Walter, "'An Electro-mechanical 'Animal '," Discorery, Norwich, March, 1950, pp. 90-3. A2</page><page sequence="4">4 J. 0. WISDOM. This raises the question of what is meant when one speaks of automata. Part of what one might have in mind is that an automaton could have no alternative courses of action open to it. The answer to this given by Dr. Mackay4 is that artifacts can be built to function in a statistical way, so that their behaviour at times is as uncertain as the break up of a radium atom, though statistically predictable on the whole. But this answer, though useful, will not satisfy us; for, in addition to the possibility of alternative courses of action, most people would have in mind something further: they would suppose that, strictly determined or not, a thing would be an automaton unless at the least it was capable of considering alternatives, though others would develop this further and maintain that a thing would be an automaton unless at the least it was capable of wanting or imagining things-a human being may or may not have freedom to satisfy his wants but at least he does have wants. On a different level, I think that some people would be inclined to regard a thing as an automaton if its mental processes were epiphenomenal. This would obviously be a mistake if epiphenomenalism were compatible with wanting, having imagination, and the like. But probably the dissatisfaction often felt with epiphenomenalism and the impression that it would reduce a person to an automaton are due to the impression that it is incompatible with such things as wanting and being imaginative. Initially all such considerations are in the main irrelevant, for they are too complex and unspecific to begin on. Nonetheless they are not unimportant; for we do in the end want answers to just this kind of thing. ? 2.1 Need Artifacts Reproduce Structure ? The behaviour of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway steam engine, " The Rocket," can be reproduced in part by a toy steam engine, and the behaviour of the former 4 D. M. MacKay, " Mind-like Behaviour in Artefacts," The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Edinburgh, 1951, Vol. II, No. 6, p. 110.</page><page sequence="5">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 5 Metropolitan Railway electric engine, " Sherlock Holmes," can be reproduced in part by a toy electric engine. But the steam engine could also be reproduced in part by a toy electric engine. That is to say, the toy would reproduce a good deal of the behaviour of the full-sized engine. The relevant different would lie in the works. It is thus desirable to distinguish between reproducing structure and reproducing function. This sort of point comes in, for instance, over the idea that electronic tubes, which are used for storage of impulses, may reproduce the way in which past experience is coded and stored in the brain; it is not known whether this mode of storage represents the brain in function alone or in structure as well. No doubt, even with present facilities, it would be possible to reproduce large classes of animal behaviour in artifacts; but it is a very different matter to reproduce the actual works, i.e., to reproduce the structure as well as the function. The attainment of such a goal in some cases is probably within sight. This raises the question of aim, why we wish to build certain kinds of model. The practical reason for building " electronic brains " is that they are vastly quicker and more efficient at carrying out certain kinds of tasks than human beings. But the reason for building models to reproduce human activities is entirely different. The aim is not to have a laboratory-made human being. If this was our aim we should perhaps do better to take some apes, speed up by some method or other their birth, attainment of maturity, and genetic mutations, and thus make the span of evolution that in fact took hundreds of millions of years repeat itself in a few months. And if we were not content to begin with an ape we could begin with an amoeba. But, interesting though it would be to build a human being in a laboratory, this is not the aim. The aim is to build models that are as like human beings as we can make them, in order to find out the respects in which they differ, and thence to find out how a human being works and to understand the mechanisms of the human machine. Clearly such an aim is more likely to be achieved if we try to reproduce not only function but also structure.</page><page sequence="6">6 J. o. WISDOM. It might be well here to mention a confusion that appears to be fairly widespread: it is thought that the possibility of reproducing adaptive behaviour in artifacts is essentially due to their being electronic. It is true that this makes for speed and efficiency, but it is otherwise irrelevant. What is fundamental is the mechanism of feed-back, and this exists in purely mechanical, i.e., non-electrical, devices such as the escapements of clocks and the governors of spring-driven gramophones. ? 2.2 Reproducing Function. Despite the importance of structure, function is the more important to concentrate on, and here a distinction may easily be overlooked. When the claim is made, and even when it is justly made, that human function can be repro- duced in an artifact, this may mean, and usually does mean, that the end-product of function is what is reproduced. But what would be more important to achieve in a model would be to reproduce the functioning of the structure, i.e., to reproduce the way in which the human being works. This may be illustrated by means of an artifact that plays chess. A digital computer in Manchester was given the task of finding the key to a problem of mate in two moves. This it did correctly, so that the behavioural end-product of its function was like that of a human being who found the right answer. But, if we look at the way the computer functioned or arrived at the solution, we shall be strongly tempted to say that it set to work very unintelligently ! Indeed in a degree examination the computer would certainly not be awarded first-class honours. What it did was to try out every possible move. This is not the way in which an intelligent human being sets to work. He begins by rejecting whole classes of moves, on the hypothesis that certain types of move are out of the question. The reply might of course be made that he does try out these moves but does so with such extreme rapidity that he does not notice what he is doing. But very often the key-move is just one of these which are rejected as obviously absurd. Hence this move cannot have been fully tried out. And there is a</page><page sequence="7">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 7 further difference in procedure. A human being often works backwards (" If I could control that square I should win "), but this is not the method of the digital computer.5 Thus the important thing to reproduce in an artifact is neither function in the sense of aim, nor structure, but functioning in the sense of " way of doing things." It seems obvious that there is no sharp criterion for distinguishing two ways of doing a thing. Though we might be inclined to regard two sets of operations as different methods on grounds of difference in order of operations, end-result, time of completion, ease of execution, or reliability, we could find two sets of operations where these features did not differ and yet we should still regard the two sets as constituting different methods. And, more important, two sets of operations that in one setting we should regard as different methods, in another setting we should regard as the same method. Thus difference depends on context, so that there is no unique list of properties that would provide a criterion. Despite this, the concept of difference of method seems to be quite clear, and, further, in any concrete case it is easy to tell whether or not there is a difference of method6. The fundamental distinction, then, is not merely between structure and function, but between structure, function in the sense of end-result or goal, and function in the sense of method of functioning. The distinction between goal and method is exactly that, to which Ashby' has drawn attention, between state of adaptation and process of adaptation. 5Mr. Mays has drawn attention to a similar point (W. Mays, " The Hypothesis of Cybernetics," The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Edinburgh, 1951, Vol. II, No. 7, pp. 249-50). 6 It makes no difference whether you put on your left shoe first or the right one so far as getting dressed is concerned. But it makes a great difference whether you put on your socks before your shoes or vice versa. Thus order may be, though it is not necessarily, important. A Japanese may get his accounts done with the same ease, in the same length of time, and with the same reliability using an abacus as an American using Arabic numerals and pencil and paper. We should usually say that the Japanese and the American used different methods; yet we might say they were the same kind of method as compared with that of a digital computer. " W. R.

WISDOM. ? 3.0 The Problem of Including Mentality in Artifacts. On the neurological hypothesis that feed-backs occur in the nervous system, e.g., in metabolism, in controlling the temperature of the body, or in the irrigation system of the body, the broad question arises whether such mechanisms together with other known ones are sufficient to enable us to describe and explain mental phenomena, i.e., whether mentality can be " built in "8 to an artifact by means of feed-backs, or whether some other, hitherto unsuspected, mechanism is needed. This can best be tackled by dividing it into three groups of questions. These cannot be given precise expression until certain concepts have been dis- cussed ; we must begin with somewhat unspecific formu- lations and make them more definite as the discussion develops. (1) Can animal behaviour ever be reproduced by means of artifacts ? Can all animal (including human) behaviour be reproduced in this way ? Are types of animal behaviour reproducible ? Is every detail reproducible ? In this group " behaviour " refers exclusively to something physiological. (2) In this group " behaviour " has a wider reference. Are mental phenomena-to use an unspecific word deliberately-that are displayed in behaviour repro- ducible ? To what extent ? Are such things as frowns reproducible ? If there should be limitations in the answers to the first two groups, would this be because what we wish to reproduce could not be reproduced in principle, in practice, or without the aid of new discoveries ? (3) If there are mental phenomena that are not dis- played in behaviour, are they reproducible ? And further questions could open up. If, for example, every detail of animal behaviour were reproducible, would 8 It is not of course intended to suggest that mentality is a kind of extra part that can be added on.</page><page sequence="9">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 9 this constitute a reason for denying a claim that there are mental phenomena that do not display themselves in behaviour ? Certainly there are many things that no engineer at present could build an artifact to do. There are technical difficulties or difficulties of complexity. Thus it would not be possible to build an artifact that would take out an appendix with anything like the skill of a clumsy surgeon. But such deficiencies are not our main interest. We are not concerned with the kind of artifact that could at the moment be constructed or represented in a blue-print. I am asking the first two groups of questions in the context of technological knowledge and technical skill that is actually available and that we may reasonably expect to become available as a result of further research on existing lines without the aid of any radically new discovery. My aim is to show that there is a certain kind of limitation to the reproduction in an artifact of psychological behaviour and of ways of behaving, and to describe certain charac- teristic mental phenomena that do not seem necessarily to display themselves in behaviour, which seem unlikely to be reproducible without some new type of mechanism, as different from feed-back as feed-back is from all previously considered mechanisms such as simple reflexes. A general way of putting this would be to say that reasons can be given to show that mentality cannot be reproduced by feed-back and other known mechanisms or that the hypothesis that feed-backs exist in the nervous system is strictly in the neurological tradition which denies that mental phenomena have any influence on behaviour.9 9 Personal attitudes in our field of discussion tend to have a certain relevance. I think this paper makes mine clear, but to obviate misunderstanding I may state it explicitly. Cybernetics and allied developments seem to me to have great potentialities. I do not think they can provide all the answers they may appear to offer at present; on the other hand, I do not ask questions with the innuendo that they cannot be answered. In this paper I am raising difficulties in the hope of evoking answers to, or at least stimulating thought on, funda- mental problems of mind and body.</page><page sequence="10">10 J. 0. WISDOM. ? 3.1 Reproducing Physiological Behaviour Questions of the first group may now be considered. Suppose a radar installation is idly scanning the sky. When an aeroplane appears the radar apparatus quickly focuses on it and sets the guns firing. They hit or they miss; the aeroplane is destroyed or flies away; and the radar reverts to unfocused scansion. So far it does not dis- criminate Messerschmidt from Spitfire. Now it would be easy within the limits of technological knowledge and even of technical skill to arrange that a Spitfire should radiate waves on a beam which would disconnect the gun circuits of a British radar apparatus when this focused on a Spitfire. Then the guns would fire only at Messerschmidts. The artifact would be displaying adaptive behaviour. Next we could add further mechanisms which would automatically set going a subsidiary block of machinery consisting of a gramophone and accessories which would play a record whenever an aeroplane was picked up; and there would be no difficulty in arranging that the gramophone subsidiary would select a record from a heap of records of war-cries whenever a Messerschmidt appeared, and selected one from another heap containing records of cheerful songs at the appearance of a Spitfire. Naturally there would have to be considerable variation in the selection " to give verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing " performance. The. artifact, through its subsidiary, would thus be displaying valuational behaviour. The various cheerful songs could be classified as positive and the war-cries as negative valuational behaviour. It is worth making the conjecture that the behaviour of young animals, including babies, is brought about by mechanisms of this kind. The central nervous system could be so wired that the animal scans with the eyes and that whenever it tracks moving objects it displays negative valuational behaviour; and there could be a mechanism to switch off the tracking, which would be brought into action by stimuli to the animal's nose, in particular from its mother, and which would set going positive valuational</page><page sequence="11">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 11 behaviour. Since stimuli affecting the nose have a short spatial range compared with those affecting the eye, the animal would even display negative valuational behaviour to its mother if she were some distance away. Though this is only a conjecture and quite probably false, it is worth mentioning because it affords a possible model for that nebulous concept " instinct." We may now consider the contention, which seems to be adopted by some authors, that all behaviour can, within the framework of present technological knowledge, be reproduced by means of an artifact. This is not such a simple contention as it looks. Several different constructions can be put on it:- (i) " Behaviour" sometimes refers to such things as wrinkled foreheads. Behaviour of this kind is in all probability reproducible in an artifact. (ii) In this paragraph " behaviour " has the same sense as in (i) ; what is raised is a question of scope. It might be thought that no artifact could reproduce behaviour in this sense in all its subtle variety of types. Perhaps this doubt is unjustified, but I suggest the following support for it. Reproduction of behaviour is a matter of building artifacts and making improvements. Walter has built Tortoise Mark I and he may do better by building Tortoise Mark II and so on. Now any early improvement is finite in scope, i.e., though a definite improvement is achieved there is room for further improvement. We might hope that excellent reproduction would be attainable in Tortoise Mark X. I suggest the possibility that, when such a stage has been reached, people will develop additional subtle types of behaviour that are not reproducible by this tortoise; we could then improve the design, but only to find that people developed a further new subtle type of behaviour not yet reproduced. Thus, though all behaviour would be reproducible, there would always be some behaviour not yet reproducible. The difference between (i) and (ii) is that (i) concerns broad types of behaviour while (ii) concerns more complex types specified to any required degree.</page><page sequence="12">12 J. 0. WISDOM. (iii) " Behaviour" is sometimes used for goal-directed activity, as exemplified by a radar-apparatus firing guns or rats finding food in a maze. In all probability behaviour in this sense is wholly reproducible. What is here meant is the end-state in which a goal is attained or unattained, and not the activity of attaining or failing to attain the goal, a point slurred over by the psychological expression " goal- directed activity." While it is something to be able to reproduce behaviour in this sense, this is only a beginning; as explained in ? 2.2 it is not the state of goal-attainment or state of adaptation that is important, but the functioning, activity of attaining, or activity of adapting. (iv) " Behaviour" could be used for the way a goal is approached. Very probably behaviour in this sense would be reproducible. It is not clear, however, whether this is borne out by existing artifacts: radar, the homeostat'0, and the " tortoises " seem to reproduce goal-attainment behaviour rather than ways of behaving; Dr. MacKay's statistical mechanism is perhaps the only one so far described that could plausibly be regarded as reproducing a way of behaving. The claim that behaviour is reproducible, if interpreted in these ways, may be granted, it seems to me, subject to a reservation about (ii). In order to build an artifact that would reproduce behaviour that it was not designed to reproduce, it would have to have a mechanism that would improve its own existing methods of reproducing behaviour. What I doubt is not that this is possible, but that it is possible within the limits of present technological knowledge without the aid of radically new mechanisms. I propose to use "Physiological Behaviourism" for hypotheses about behaviour in any of the foregoing senses. The preceding analysis concerns the general form of contention that behaviour is, with present facilities, repro- ducible. A carefully restricted form of it, however, has been 10 W. R. Ashby, " Design for a Brain," Electronic Engineering, London, December, 1948, Vol. XX, pp. 379-83.</page><page sequence="13">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 13 put forward by Dr. MacKay and should be mentioned separately: Any pattern of observable behaviour which can be specified in terms of unique and precisely-definable reactions to precisely-definable situations can in principle be imitated mechanically."x Any pattern of observable behaviour which can be defined statistically in terms of probable reactions to given situations, can in principle be shown by an artifact. x The distinctions drawn above have less relevance here. Whether or not Dr. MacKay would hold that his contentions are true no matter which sense of " behaviour" is taken, it would be reasonable to do so, whereas the contention in its general form is questionable on at least one interpretation of" behaviour." The first of Dr. MacKay's statements by itself adds an element of precision to the general contention by demarcating and characterising a kind of behaviour that is reproducible, but does not otherwise bear on the present discussion, for it simply tells us, however, precisely, that some behaviour is reproducible, and this we already know. The second statement is the more important one. I take it to mean this: whenever some situation recurs, any specifiable pattern of observable behaviour that accompanies it in an approximately constant proportion of instances can in principle be reproduced in an artifact. This of course still leaves open the question whether all known specifiable types of behaviour recur with constant frequency in relation to their stimuli. Further there seems to be nothing in this principle to ensure that an artifact could, like a human being, produce new types of behaviour in reaction to a given stimulus. ? 3.2 Reproducing Personal Behaviour. There is a further group of constructions that can be put on the claim that behaviour is reproducible, depending on further senses of" behaviour." This raises the second group of questions. I propose to use " Personal Behaviourism " for hypotheses about behaviour in any of the senses now to be mentioned. xx MacKay, op. cit., p. 108. 12 Id., p. 112, author's italics.</page><page sequence="14">14 J. o. WISDOM. (v) In contrast with (i), in which " behaviour" refers to wrinkled foreheads and the like, the word may be used to refer to such things as frowns. Observing a frown is not the same as observing a wrinkled forehead, but there is an appropriate sense of " observe " for each, at least from the point of view of psychological description.13 (vi) On the extremely doubtful supposition that types of personal behaviour in the sense just described are reproduc- ible, there would arise the question, parallel to (ii), whether all the subtle variety of types of personal behaviour could be reproduced. I suggest that this may be doubted on the same grounds as mentioned in connexion with (ii), namely, that for every improvement made in an artifact to reproduce personal behaviour, people would develop further new subtle types of personal behaviour not yet reproduced. And in this context the point is reinforced by experience: the more adept we may become at reading a person's feelings, the more adept he may become at disguising them. (vii) Parallel to (iii) " behaviour " could be used for goal-attainment where the goal was personal. Here the goal for a rat might be not food but greedy eating. Like (iii) this is relatively unimportant. (viii) Parallel to (iv), " behaviour" could be used for personal ways of doing things. Doing accounts with an abacus and with pencil and paper are different ways of behaving, as described in (iv). By contrast, playing tennis carefully and playing it nonchalantly are different forms of personal behaviour. If the claim under consideration is interpreted by any of these forms of personal behaviour, it is difficult to see how it could be substantiated, subject to the condition that reproduction is to be carried out by mechanisms within the 13 The distinction between " behaviour " used of wrinkled foreheads and " behaviour " used of frowns is of basic importance, in view of the amount of psychological research that is devoted to physiological behaviour to the exclusion of personal behaviour, especially when some influential psychologists seem to believe that in studying physiological behaviour there is nothing further to be done with regard to personal behaviour. In this connexion it seems to me that Professor Ryle's The Concept of Mind has been widely interpreted--I would say misinterpreted-as favouring physiological behaviourism.</page><page sequence="15">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 15 scope of present technological knowledge without the aid of radically new mechanisms. And here for an artifact to possess the capacity to improve its own mechanisms for reproducing behaviour, though necessary, would not be sufficient. The problem here in short is how to reproduce in an artifact without new mechanisms the joy or grief that may suffuse a human face4. ? 3.3 Adaptation and Attitude We turn now to a different kind of factor involved in the second group of questions. If an artifact meets a dangerous animal, evasive action becomes of prime importance. It may adapt itself, in the way already described, by reacting in one way to a Messerschmidt and in another way to a Spitfire. But this is not the way a human being adapts. He does indeed adapt in this way in so far as his muscles are strung ready for quick defence or flight; but this is not (except on a very extreme hypothesis) an adequate description, for he becomes alert and tense. Now this kind of reaction differs from that of radar, for it is attitudinal. Further, the attitude involved is of a certain important kind: when a human distinguishes between a Messerschmidt and a Spitfire, or between a lion and a lamb, his attitude is interpretative; moreover, avoiding a Messerschmidt or a lion and welcoming a Spitfire or a lamb issue from a difference of interpretation15. That is to say ' I would tentatively urge a further possibility: there may exist mental phenomena, e.g. imagination (discussed below), that do not display themselves in behaviour in the immediate sort of way in which anger may be displayed in a face: and, if so, there is quite possibly a barrier to reproducing personal behaviour unless these other mental phenomena are reproducible, because the ways in which personal behaviour are displayed would probably originate in them. 15 To speak of a man as having an attitude or as interpreting an object does not imply that he must be reflecting upon his attitude or his interpretation or deliberating upon his future action. It is to say, following Ryle's distinction (Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, London, 1949, Ch. II), that he knows how to cope with a certain situation, without needing to know that there is something to be dealt with, just as one may know how to ride a bicycle without necessarily knowing that the front wheel must be turned a little to the side on which one is beginning to fall. Likewise to speak of an interpretation does not imply that a man must reflect upon his interpretation.</page><page sequence="16">16 J. o. WISDOM. not only is the object recognised but also the future behaviour of foe and friend is anticipated. What is anticipated may not be specific; there may be only a general expectancy. There are many kinds of things an object might do if it is a foe, and a man will expect one or other of these to materialise. On the other hand, if the object is a friend, the man will expect it to do something or other of a very different kind. But further, a man in greeting a friend and avoiding a foe does not merely display a " pro-attitude " and a " con- attitude " in the sense that he habitually displays different behaviour towards friend and foe. To hold that men or animals possess only this kind of attitude would perhaps amount to placing them in the category of automata. Con- sider, for example, the kind of wasp that stores caterpillars in closed compartments. When one such wasp was engaged in this activity, an observer tried the effect of making new openings, whereupon the wasp proceeded to close them; further, the observer took out some of the caterpillars, only to find that the wasp put in others before closing the holes16 Now this behaviour may issue from just " pro- " and " con-attitudes " towards holes and caterpillars (though the possibility of valuation should not be overlooked). In man at least there is in addition this to be remembered: a man does not just avoid a lion merely because of what he anticipates about it; he wants to avoid it because he does not like what he anticipates. That is to say, he has towards the lion not only an interpretative attitude but also a valuational attitude--indeed a negative one. Thus a man displays both an interpretative attitude and a valuational attitude. And this is quite different from displaying adaptive behaviour or even valuational behaviour or both. The second type of question raised in ? 3.0 is therefore very different from the first. The second type now becomes more specific: can we reproduce attitudes in an artifact, particularly interpretative and valuational attitudes ? 16 For this and a number of other examples see Kali Prasad, The Psychology of Meaning, Lucknow, 1949, pp. 50-63. Prasad is concerned throughout with the idea of interpretative attitude, though he uses a different terminology.</page><page sequence="17">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 17 ? 3.4 Artifactual Weighing of Eventualities. This section raises a question which when made explicit belongs to the third group of questions; it will be discussed in the next section. Here it may appear to belong to the second group--or even to the first. Having an interpretative attitude to an object involves at least some degree of recognition of the object and having expectancies, whether definite or vague. An animal that has such an attitude is expecting certain eventualities, half- expecting others, not really expecting others, while some it is not expecting at all. In the simplest case, its action will be determined by the kind of eventuality it most strongly expects and it will not act in a way that would be appropriate towards a scarcely expected eventuality. Thus its action is determined, among other things, by the weights attached to different eventualities; and this shows the importance of the procedure of weighing eventualities. It is something that can occur in different kinds of context. "Is this object friend or foe ? " The object is not specifically interpreted; it is kept under a watchful eye; the attitude is one of alertness, with suspense of specific interpretation; both eventualities are weighed, or two sets of future possibilities are compared (and it is ready to act upon either). " This is a lion." The object is specifically interpreted; one eventuality or type of eventuality only is strongly expected; and it is weighed against the actual behaviour of the lion. Thus one eventuality or type of eventuality may be weighed against another on the one hand, or on the other an eventuality or type of eventuality may be weighed against an actuality. Whichever happens is not important here; what matters is that an interpretative attitude involves the weighing of an eventuality. This raises the question of how to build recognition of objects and weighing of eventualities into an artifact. In order to consider it, let us try out the following construction (in which a number of improvements could doubtless be made). Suppose an artifact runs a subsidiary section for recognition of objects and another one for the examination B</page><page sequence="18">18 J. 0. WISDOM. of eventualities (it is convenient though perhaps not necessary to have these two activities carried on by two sections rather than one). The recognition-section contains, say, a number of storage tubes each containing electronic vibrations set in motion either by the engineer who built the artifact or by previous experience of some kind of object. Thus there is a tube whose vibrations correspond to the scansion of an animal, another whose vibrations correspond to the scansion of an aeroplane, and so on. The artifact scans and picks up a distant animal, say, and not an aeroplane. The resulting impulses synchronise with the impulses in the corresponding storage tube and not with those in the tube storing aeroplane impulses. The synchronisation switches on a corresponding portion of the anticipation-section, dealing with animals and not with aeroplanes. This searches through its files, say films or magnetic tape, possibly examining several such files simultaneously. One file might be the record of an animal that was a lamb grazing peacefully; another that of a lion tearing an artifact limb from limb. Different circuits that would bring about different kinds of action in the artifact are set reverberating. Thus the record of the lamb would set going a circuit that could stop the scansion of the animal, while that of the lion would set going a circuit that could produce evasive action such as firing a gun. As yet, however, these circuits do not bring about action in the artifact, because the leads from them are broken by a switch. But, when the animal approaches closely enough and is in fact a lion, the scansion no longer synchronises with the lamb recognition-tube and the corresponding anticipa- tion-circuit ceases to be active. There is now synchronisation between the scansion and the lion recognition-tube alone. When there is only one anticipation-circuit left active, the switch disconnecting this from the rest of the artifact is thrown, so that connexion is effected, and the artifact sets evasive action in motion. Thus in a peculiar sense we have in the interpretation both comparison with past observations of a similar type, analogous to recognition, and comparison with future eventualities, analogous to anticipation. But this is not the</page><page sequence="19">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 19 way we all believe-except in theoretical epiphenomenalist, neutral monist, or operationalist moods-that human beings compare actualities and possibilities. One inadequacy about this mechanism is that eventualities are not weighed but play their part automatically or deterministically. To overcome this, a probability or statistical device could be added in the way suggested by Dr. MacKay, so that the particular anticipation-circuit that finally determines the subsequent action of the artifact would be selected statistically on the basis of previous experience. Even then, however, this kind of artifact would not be true to the way in which a human being functions; even with a statistical device it would remain in a sense automatic. It omits the valuational aspect of weighing; and it fails to take account of weighing as an affair of the imagination (these are doubtless closely connected). While therefore it seems possible to build in a mechanism for reproducing interpretative attitudes in the sense that it can compare possibilities and can have a " pro-attitude " or a " con-attitude " without valuation, our artifact is still far from human. We have yet to see whether it is possible to humanise it, at least in part by building in imagination as a minimum requirement. ? 3.5 Imagination. Here we come to a fundamental question of the third group. The weighing of eventualities involves imagining a possi- bility, i.e., imagining something to be happening that is not happening. What is imagined is not real, but it may be in another sense " very real." It shares with what is real some characteristics; others it does not share. An imagined lion may share with a real lion such things as form and behaviour. What it does not share is the capacity to have effects upon other objects and animals in general, or to suffer effects brought about by other objects and animals. To this, however, there is one exception: the capacity to have effects upon the person who imagines it is shared at</page><page sequence="20">20 j. 0. WISDOM. times or in part with a real thing; yet this is usually subject to a certain control, so that what is imagined may not always or wholly share with a real thing its effects on the person. Thus the respects in which an imagined thing differs from a real one are (i) absence of environmental effects and (ii) incomplete resemblance between its effects and the effects of a real thing upon a person. It is the latter that is the important and peculiar feature. An imagined lion can frighten, but it does not frighten in the same way as a real one does. The special kind of difference is very close to the difference between seeing a drama on the stage and seeing the same sort of action take place off the stage. It is one thing to see Ophelia in the film of Hamlet throw herself into the water; it is another to see a girl throw herself into the Nile. It is all very well to say that the difference lies in the knowledge one has that the play is only a pretence. That only tells us the thing is not happening. But then why do we get excited or miserable about it; why does the pretence have an effect to some extent as if the pretence was not a pretence ? If we compare the difference between the effects on a person due to something imagined and something real of the same sort, we can find all degrees of resemblance (or difference). To imagine your bicycle leaning against one wall of your garage when you know you put it against the opposite wall may have practically no effect on you; but to go and find it in a different place will have some appreci- able effect. To see the film of Ophelia drowning herself will have different effects according to the degree to which you " lose yourself" in the situation. Sane people can CC pull themselves together " or " return to their senses " voluntarily. Insane people cannot always do so. Another way of putting this is to say that sane people realise that what is imagined is not real. Insane people do not have this realisation all the time. When they do not, what is imagined is then a hallucination. Thus what is imagined may be "rather unreal," " very real," or " completely real "; and in the last case it will have exactly the same</page><page sequence="21">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 21 effects upon the person as if he were confronted with a real thing of the same sort'7. To explain these facts we could set up the following hypothesis: that the effect on a person due to an imagined happening is describable as the effect due to a similar real happening modified by the fact that the person can, if the effect threatens to become " too real," control it or stop it-or even reverse it. Hallucination would be a limiting case where control was zero. What this is saying is that in all imagining what is imagined tends to have exactly the same effects as if it were real. But, even if this is not accepted, it must be admitted that, corresponding to the degree to which the imagined situation affects a person, something about it is being treated as fully real. And in the limiting case the insane person treats some of the things he imagines as wholly real. We thus have the problem: how is it that an imaginary occurrence can in some circumstances or in some degree affect a person as if it were real ? Can we reproduce this peculiarity of mentality in an artifact ? An imagined lion may frighten a person considerably if he imagines himself being mauled by it; but what is the analogue to this in an artifact ? Does it allow its anticipa- tion-subsidiary to be actually damaged, as if mauled ? It might indeed blow a fuse, which would be replaced automatically by a new one, as in the London Tubes. But this is obviously not like the mechanism of human imagina- tion. It admits of no degrees between terror and calm-you can't blow a fuse in some degree. Thus we cannot evade our problem in this kind of way. Our artifact must have the capacity to recognise danger, the possibility of being damaged, and imagine the damage, without being damaged. What kind of mechanism could we build in that would reproduce these very special features of the imagination- that what is imagined does nothing to the artifact, yet in a 17 An insane person may of course suffer far greater effects from something imagined than from the same thing when real; but this complication is not relevant here. B2</page><page sequence="22">22 J. O. WISDOM. sense does the same sort of thing to it as something real does ? It is worth expressing the problem in a more general form. Fundamental in imagination is the duplication of one thing and the merging of two things. When a person is imagining himself doing something or something being done to him, he usually imagines himself somewhere else-a few feet away perhaps from where he actually is. Thus in imagination-situations a person usually or always imagines himself duplicated. Likewise when watching someone else doing something or undergoing something, he may imagine that person to be where he himself is (though he may also imagine himself where that person is). Thus in imagination- situations a person tends to merge someone else with himself (or himself with someone else). By what kind of mechanism, then, could an artifact imagine itself at a place other than where it is ? And by what kind of mechanism could an artifact imagine some object occupying the place where it itself is without itself moving ? ? 3.6 Reproducing Imagination. An upholder of the view that mentality could be fully reproduced in an artifact built with existing mechanisms would reply that the behavioural effects of imagination could be reproduced. Thus in a person watching a film of Ophelia drowning herself certain anticipation-sections would be activated, which could lead him to dive into the water to rescue her or to telephone for an ambulance, but recognition of the unreality of the situation could be arranged to prevent these circuits from starting off any action by him, except for, say, small movements in his seat. Let us grant this, for the kernel of the problem does not lie here, and let us grant more: let us grant (a) that what a person does is reproducible, (b) that physiological behaviour is reproducible, and even (c) that personal behaviour is reproducible. The question, then, is this: when these things are reproduced, is imagining ipso facto reproduced ? It would seem obvious that this is not necessarily the case, for these effects might be brought about in a way that</page><page sequence="23">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 23 is not the way of imagination. Clearly, if imagining does not display itself in personal behaviour and if imagining is an indispensable element in our way of doing things, then (a), (b) and (c) do not suffice for the reproduction of all kinds of mentality. Hence it would seem obvious that reproducing imagination would be a special problem, probably requiring new mechanisms. All this may seem obvious. But it could be denied on one ground-that of Epiphenomenalism (in the context this doctrine may do duty for Neutral Monism and Operational- ism). If Epiphenomenalism is true, it would seem that the task of building mentality into an artifact would be easier than if Epiphenomenalism is false, for we might hope that sufficiently complicated feed-backs would do the trick. I have elsewhere described a model of mind-body interaction in which the mind would be capable of autonomous activityis. If this is true, it seems obvious that we cannot describe mentality by means of feed-backs and other known mechanisms unaided. But, even if Epiphenomenalism is true, the task remains great. In a certain sense we should not have to build mentality into an artifact; but we should still have to build an artifact that would not only reproduce human activities in the way in which human beings carry out their activities, but also to do so in such a way that the machinery would be found to have an additional quality- epiphenomenal mentality. And here, too, feed-backs and other known mechanisms alone might well be sufficient. Thus Epiphenomenalism might seem to have little practical relevance. But it can hardly be doubted that one's approach to research problems in cybernetics and connected fields would be very different if.one tended to believe Epipheno- menalism from what it would be if one tended to disbelieve it: looking for a mechanism with an incidental emergent property is a very different thing from looking for a mechanism to reproduce autonomous mentality. 16 J. O. Wisdom, "A New Model for the Mind-Body Relationship," The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Edinburgh, 1952, Vol. II, No. 8, pp. 295-301.</page><page sequence="24">24 J. 0. WISDOM. Moreover, the issue of Epiphenomenalism is relevant from the theoretical point of view. Since it has not been decisively tested, the issue remains open. And it is difficult even to decide whether we should try first to decide whether Epiphenomenalism is true or false before considering imagination in artifacts or investigate this first as a means of deciding the issue of Epiphenomenalism. One point may be mentioned. If Epiphenomenalism is true, imagination is not a dynamical factor in determining behaviour. Then weighing eventualities would be like a question of trying out all possible moves in a chess problem in a literal way. But there is one move that the chess computer does not try out-its own destruction. Now this would be an important move for an. artifact faced with a dangerous animal. But an artifact built on known lines can try out the move of its own destruction only by destroying itself. Hence, if Epiphenomenalism is true, imagining its own destruction is impossible to reproduce as a method of achieving ends. But imagination appears to try out this move in some non-literal way-which suggests that Epiphenomenalism is false. It would seem, therefore, that imagination at least here has an independent r6le. If this is so, we are up against the formidable task of finding a mechanism that would enable us to build imagination into an artifact. It is difficult to find any kind of reasonable parallel to the duplication features of imagination described above. Consider an insulated charge in the neighbourhood of an insulated conductor consisting of either a plane sheet of metal or a hemispherical shell. A charge of the same sign as the given charge will be found on the side of the conductor facing away from the given charge. Here we have a form of duplication that conceivably might prove useful. Duplication is of course also to be found in the images produced by lenses and mirrors; they have the interesting property that they do not exist like ordinary objects and yet their position in space can be precisely located. The main reason for mentioning such far-fetched</page><page sequence="25">SYMPOSIUM: MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 25 analogies here is to underline the difficulty of finding any kind of model for the imagination, and therefore to suggest that a different kind of mechanism from those at present envisaged would be needed before we could reproduce imagination in an artifact. Dr. MacKay has indicated that he would reproduce imagination by means of a " replication-mechanism " in an artifact.19 It is not clear to me that his " replication- mechanism " would provide a model of what we ordinarily understand by imagination, but it would be premature to comment on it before seeing it worked out in detail. ? 4. Summary and Conclusion. We start from the hypothesis that adaptive behaviour can be explained by feed-back and other auxiliary mechan- isms in the nervous system. We should not be satisfied that we were reproducing human activity in an artifact at all adequately unless as a minimum it could want and like things and weigh eventualities and have imagination. Hence we are confronted with the question whether such mental capacities could be reproduced. We are not concerned with radical technological difficulties that have yet to be surmounted; we are concerned only to know how far we can go with the technological knowledge we may reasonably expect to have by continued research on existing lines and with our existing framework of ideas. If we divide behaviour into physiological behaviour and personal behaviour, we see that research has concentrated on reproducing the former, not without success. There remains a doubt whether the reproduction of this field could be complete. On the other hand, the issue of reproducing personal behaviour, in the sense described above, does not appear to have been explicitly raised. Here a radically new type of mechanism would seem to be required. Further, there seem to be certain basal mental capacities, inter- pretative and valuational attitudes and weighing of even- tualities, which, if regarded as having a certain " reality " 1O MacKay, op. cit., p. 114 f.</page><page sequence="26">26 J. o. WISDOM. denied them by Epiphenomenalism, involve something that does not display itself in personal--or for that matter in physiological--behaviour. This something is imagination. The peculiar feature of it is that something unreal has real effects. This pecularity has a more general form: in imagination-situations a human being imagines himself duplicated or else as fused with someone else. This seems to defy reproduction in an artifact by any known type of mechanism. The only available analogues are those of induced charges on conductors and images in lenses and mirrors, but it is hard to see how to utilise them. The difficulty of the problem would be lessened, though not removed, if Epiphenomenalism were true. The general conclusion, if Epiphenomenalism is false, is that mentality cannot be reproduced in an artifact without the discovery of some radically new type of mechanism; or, otherwise expressed, that the feed-back hypothesis is in the neurological tradition and leaves basic features of men- tality out of its purview. If Epiphenomenalism is true, this conclusion would have to be replaced by a weakened version. There is reason to believe that the feed-back hypothesis will lead to considerable advances in neurology. And the central ideas may be helpful in psychology (a possibility I have not discussed here). Further, it is quite possible that ultimately we may be able to reproduce mentality in artifacts. But this seems to be outside the range of any kind of artifact that can be devised at present.</page><page sequence="27">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. II.--By R. J. SPILSBURY. MR. WISDOM has given an interesting survey of the achieve- ments of those people whose aim it is to construct a model of man which will show some of the salient features of human and animal adaptation to a changing environment. He has given also a critical account of the main points of strain at which any conceivable model must necessarily break down owing to its lack of certain qualities the absence of which is incompatible with the attainment of full human status. However human the model may appear in its general range of activity, however superhuman it may seem for its speed, accuracy and persistence in the performance of such specialised tasks as large-figure calculations, it remains definitely outside the human fold so long as it is unable to equip itself with a mind. Particular emphasis has been placed on man's imaginative powers of self-fission and self- fusion, as a test-case of the possibilities of mechanical representation of mental processes. This seems to me a good example to take, and I shall concentrate the latter part of my paper on this problem. The other problem which I shall select for examination, out of those raised by Mr. Wisdom, is the problem of the " goal-seeking " machine: the problem of the admissibility of the claim that machines can be constructed which will display purposeful behaviour. On the view to be examined, the resemblances between a cat tracking a rat, and an automatic torpedo " hunting " its target, are not superficial or fortuitous ; for there are believed to be common principles operative which account for the resemblance. The fashionable hypothesis is that all purposeful activity exemplifies one or other of the various " feed-back " mechanisms, the operation of which accounts for the distinctive features of such activity. This is the claim that I wish to examine in the first part of my paper. C</page><page sequence="28">28 R. J. SPILSBURY. In order to escape the risk of knocking at unoccupied houses, I shall begin by referring to a recent discussion on this theme by three collaborators in this field of enquiry.' Their views (so far as they are here relevant) may be summarised thus. To call any activity " purposeful " is to say that it may be interpreted as being directed to the attainment of a goal ; that is, to a final condition in which some behaving object reaches some definite correlation in time or space with respect to some other object or event. Some, but not all, machines are purposeful in this sense: some, like roulette, are purposeless and expressly designed for purposelessness ; some are orderly but not purposeful, for instance clocks, since there is no specific final condition towards which the movement of the clock strives ; and some are intrinsically purposeful, such as a torpedo with a target-seeking mechanism. All purposeful behaviour is controlled by negative feed-back from the goal ; that is, there must be signals from the goal which are used to restrict outputs which would otherwise go beyond the goal. Negative feed-back mechanisms ensure that " the behaviour of an object is controlled by the margin of error at which the object stands at a given time with reference to a relatively specific goal." When the goal is a moving one (e.g. a mouse or a Messerschmidt) it is generally necessary that there should be continuous feed-back from the goal controlling the movements of the cat or gun, if the chase is to be success- ful in its aim. To develop this point in words different from those used by the writers : If you are pursuing some object, which is trying to escape, the constant adjustments of direction, speed, etc., which are necessary will only be forthcoming if controlled and corrected by knowledge of the constantly-changing relationship between your own movements and the movements of the object ; a knowledge which shows itself in the appropriateness of the counter- moves and anticipatory moves which you make with a 1 A. Rosenblueth, N. Wiener, J. Bigelow : " Behaviour, Purpose, and Teleology," Philosophy of Science, Baltimore, 1943, Vol. 10.</page><page sequence="29">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 29 view to closing the gap between yourself and the object pursued. There has as it were to be a double stream of information flowing back to the pursuer, information about his own current (or most recent) position and movements, together with the corresponding information about the target ; and these two information-flows have to be constantly related to one another as movement succeeds movement, each correcting the errors of its predecessor and each being succeeded by a fresh inflow of information, until finally, when the target has been reached, the two streams fuse together, i.e. the gap between pursuer and pursued has been closed. One of the claims which this article seems to be making is that all pursuits (and avoidances) are of this general kind, that all are made possible by feed-back arrangements which follow the same basic principles, irrespective of the particular characteristics of the objects concerned, whether organic or inorganic. Every escape- pursuit situation develops into a contest between opposing feed-back mechanisms, in which victory lies not necessarily with the swifter or stronger, but with the contestant equipped with the best means of using and reacting to the incoming streams of signals and stimuli. More importantly, this pursuer-pursued model is apparently generalised to cover all forms of purposeful activity, and the conclusion is reached that " teleological behaviour thus becomes synonymous with behaviour controlled by negative feed- back."22 This conclusion probably strikes most people as para- doxical and unwarranted. Perhaps their natural objections can be expressed as follows: These analogies between the behaviour of organisms and the workings of various auto- 2 The distinction drawn by these writers between " teleological " and " purposeful " behaviour does not seem important for the present discussion. " Teleological " is the description given to behaviour which is controlled by continuous feed-back throughout the behaviour-sequence, whereas by " purposeful " behaviour it is meant that an activity-sequence is initiated through the reception of signals from the goal, but once the activity is under way no further goal-signals alter its course. c2</page><page sequence="30">30 R. J. SPILSBURY. matic devices are interesting enough, and may even be illuminating for certain restricted purposes : quite possibly the nervous systems of animals and men do show, in their sensory-motor functioning, some of the same features of response and control as are to be found in servo-mechanisms. But to exploit these resemblances in such a way as to call these methods of functioning " intrinsically purposeful " is grossly misleading, since it is to confuse unthinking mech- anisms of execution with the desires which they serve and the planned forethought on which they depend for their serviceability. This confusion has always been one of the occupational temptations to which constructors of ingenious mechanisms so often succumb. Traces of the same attitude may indeed be discerned in the way in which all makers of things (and their critics) tend to speak of their products, transferring to these, epithets which properly apply to themselves, the makers. Thus it is that one speaks of a " clever " contrivance, an " unimaginative" design, an " ingenious " tool, a " tired " theory, a " thoughtful " picture, and so on. All that is necessary in such cases is to point out the risk of process-product confusion inherent in such modes of speech, and hope that the hint will be taken. No-one, it may be said, really believes that a picture is capable of feeling emotion, for all that it may be called " feeling " or " unfeeling " ; similarly, when somebody remarks on the purposeful character of the latest target- " seeking " engines, he does not seriously mean to attribute to these engines a go-whither-they-will never-give-up disposition. The anthropomorphic habit of referring to the " lapses " and " errors " made by mechanical instruments is a fanciful and half-humourous attempt on the part of machine-users and designers to shelve responsibility for their own faults and carelessnesses. The psychological source of these misallocations of blame and credit may be attributed by some to the sense of continuity and closeness, almost kinship, which men feel towards the instruments "with " which they work and on which they lavish so much care and thought. The modern technician no longer sees a spirit in the stars and streams-for he seldom sees these at all ;</page><page sequence="31">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 31 instead, he finds a man in the engines which " accompany " him all his days and with which he has to " co-operate " closely if he is to get a living. And the old fears of Nature's tyranny and violence are replaced by half-serious fear- fantasies about the potential threat to human freedom and survival inherent in the growing dominance of these engines over the conditions of human existence. Such nightmares are no less irrational than the dreams of a golden techno- logical age, in which freedom from onerous toil becomes the guaranteed right of every man. However, I do not think this summary treatment-and dismissal-of the problem is adequate in this instance. When arguments and analyses are offered in support of an opinion, however outrageous this may seem to common reflection, they should be scrutinised and (if possible) countered before resort is taken to psycho-social speculations about the genesis of such beliefs. What then is it that the writers whose views I have summarised above wish to express exactly, when they refer to the 'intrinsic purpose- fulness' of the torpedo equipped with a target-seeking mechanism ? Unless I have misunderstood them, what they wish to indicate by this expression is that the torpedo is equipped with feed-back devices so that its direction of movement can be modified by what are called ' signals' (e.g., sound- waves or light-rays) given out by some object G of a specified kind in the torpedo's 'environment' (i.e., within range of its 'detector '-apparatus); the result of this continuous modification being that the paths of the torpedo and the G-object tend to converge. In such circumstances G may be called the goal of the torpedo, and the intrinsic purpose of the torpedo is to bring about an intersection of G's path by its own. This resembles an analysis offered by Mr. MacKay of the sentence " A seeks the goal X " which runs as follows : " Let the current state of A (plus its environment) be defined as Y. Let X define that state of A-plus-environ- ment which we term the goal of A. Then the statement above [that A seeks the goal X] implies that the activity</page><page sequence="32">32 R. J. SPILSBURY. of A in a defined group of circumstances is such as inter alia to minimise the discrepancy between X and Y."3 Now what concept of purpose do these definitions and analyses imply? What seems clear is that 'purposeful activity' is being defined and discussed in terms of the constancy of certain end-results or final trends, the stability of which contrasts strongly with the variability of the sequences leading up to them.4 All the emphasis is being placed on the power of certain mechanisms to bring about certain consistent results within a range of varying environ- mental conditions, without human intervention or control. What is left out, presumably as irrelevant to an ' objective' analysis, is the power to anticipate these results, and the consequential power of evaluating actions as successful or unsuccessful with reference to such aims and anticipations. This omission seems to invalidate the analysis proposed above, if intended as an analysis of human purposefulness: for unless purpose can be distinguished from performance- trends and outcomes, it would seem nonsensical to raise the question whether X was really A's goal, if A repeatedly acted in such a way as to bring X about. Yet this is a question which can often be sensibly asked, since to say that a person is in the habit of acting in such a way as to bring about some result X does not entail that that person is aiming to bring X about, though it may in some circumstances be good evidence as to his aims. To pass over the distinction be- tween foreseen and unforeseen consequences, between accidental and intentional results is not to pass over some 3 " Mindlike Behaviour in Artifacts," The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Vol. II, No. 6, p. 106. I do not wish to imply that Mr. MacKay fully endorses the arguments or conclusions of Wiener et al., summarised above. In this paper he disclaims philosophical significance for his analysis of goal- seeking, which is subsidiary to his main theme. 4 Cf. the following statement : " The term 'goal-seeking' is meant . . simply to describe systems which are observed to change towards some definite state or condition. A thermostat, for example, shows its 'goal-seeking' property in simple form when it persists in returning to a central temperature (the 'goal '), no matter how its temperature may be temporarily disturbed." W. R. Ashby, " Mechanisms of Intelligent Action," p. 82. Included in " Perspectives in Neuropsychiatry," edited by D. Richter (1950).</page><page sequence="33">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 33 minute subtlety of purposive action: a central distinction is being effaced. But perhaps I am going too fast in assuming that this distinction, or an analogous one, cannot be drawn within the confines of the present analysis. For this, it may be replied, is where the feed-back arrangements come in. The distinction between intended and accidental results can be analysed in terms of the distinction between feed- back behaviour and non-feed-back behaviour, i.e., between results which have come about through feed-back from the goal and those which cannot be attributed to any such feed-back control. Suppose, for example, that a motorist on a dark night had the misfortune to run over a dog which he did not see dashing across the road, this might be classified as an accident (so far as the driver was concerned) on the grounds that the movements of the dog had no influence on the movements of the car: the car was not steered towards the dog by the driver as a result of the sensory feed-back information coming in to him about the relative position of car and dog, since he was not getting any such information. The driving was 'blind' so far as the dog-incident was concerned. Had there been no dog and no dash across the road, the car's course would have been the same up to the point where it met the dog. A deliberate attempt to run over the dog would have necessitated continuous feed-back from the dog as the temporary ' goal ' of the driver. But this correction, while it may (in some circumstances) indicate one of the necessary conditions which must be satisfied before a behaviour-sequence can be regarded as directed to some specific goal, does not seem sufficient. A person's behaviour may result in some changed relation- ship between himself (or his instruments) and some other person or object G: and the agent's performance may be controlled by continuous feed-back from G: yet it does not follow that this changed relationship corresponds to the agent's purpose, or even approximates to it. Perhaps the following story will help illustrate this. A gunner during the war had been ordered to engage a target of enemy</page><page sequence="34">34 R. J. SPILSBURY. infantry visible from his O.P. The normal method of ranging was by a process of continuous correction, in which a 'bracket' of shots plus and minus of the target was obtained, which could be used to obtain a smaller bracket, and so on until the target was bracketed closely enough to make general fire feasible. On this occasion the gunner felt disinclined to carry out his orders, as he suspected that some of his own infantry were in the target area, but since he himself was under observation by his senior officer, who insisted on the shoot, he decided that he would pretend to engage the target, ranging on it in the orthodox way but making some ' mistake ' in the final orders to the guns which would bring fire down away from the target-area. This he accomplished, until he came to the point where battery fire was to be ordered: at this point, from sheer force of drill, he found himself mistakenly giving the 'correct' order, i.e., the order which when applied to the gun-sights caused the guns to be directed at the target, which was accordingly hit. Here the outcome of the gunner's shoot was very different from what he had planned, even though his actions were throughout controlled by the information received as a result of his preceding orders. The outcome was such as, on practically all similar occasions, could have been safely identified with the gunner's aim: but on this occasion it was not so, for his 'ostensible goal' did not correspond to his real intentions. Hence the danger of trying to define goals and purposes in terms of performances and their outcomes. The gunner hit the target which he was trying to miss : quite possibly another gunner, trying to hit the target, would have missed it. A further complication enters into the sequel to this story, for the gunner discovered afterwards that none of his own infantry were in the target-area ; and so it could be said that the results he brought about were after all in accord with his wider policy and aims, though at variance with his mistaken analysis of the best means of carrying out that policy in the situation which confronted him. The gunner was misinformed in his appreciation, mistaken in his programme, unsuccessful in application, and lucky in</page><page sequence="35">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 35 the way these errors cancelled each other out so as to further his dominant purposes. It is not easy to see how these complex patterns of purpose and performance, success and failure, skill and inefficiency, sincerity and pretence, could be paralleled in any of the target-seeking missiles under present consideration. (This of course is one of the reasons why such devices are more reliable, if more limited, executants than man- operated or man-piloted missiles.) The attribution of purposefulness to the automatic torpedo seems to be the result of confusing purposes with powers. The torpedo has been equipped by its designers with remarkable powers of performance, and its human makers also have a varied range of abilities, through the training of inherited powers ; but the purposes of human beings, far from being identical with their trained powers, often conflict with them, ambition far outstripping the possibility of per- formance. Certainly it seems inadequate, where men are concerned, to say with Mr. MacKay that if a person is seeking to achieve some goal X, then his action is such as to minimise the difference between X and his current state or situation. Surely we must at least make the correction that in such circumstances A will act in a way which seems likely to him to reduce the difference between X and his present state-however far such action may in fact take him away from his goal. (Even this correction does not bring out the possibility of a divergence between programme as planned and actual performance.)5 To repeat my previous point : it is hazardous to identify a person's goals with any of his attainments, or even trends of attainment, since he may consistently act in such a way as to precipitate some condition or climax which frustrates or masks his real 5 It may be argued that this shows the " superiority " of machines over men : the goals of machines are always achieved. I would prefer to put it the other way round-whatever result a machine achieves may be defined as its temporary goal during that activity-sequence. But this empties " goal " of any distinctive meaning, so that it can be dropped without loss in this context.</page><page sequence="36">36 R. J. SPILSBURY. purpose ; and this may occur even though he takes special precautions to avoid that condition. For instance, the unlucky or unskilful criminal may find that his criminal activities always lead up to the same conclusion, a term of imprisonment, as though this was his main goal in life. Every move the criminal makes may in fact be such as to make his arrest more probable, even though every move is made in the firm (and perhaps not unreasonable) belief that it will make his detection less probable. (This invariability of result is of course quite consistent with great variability of behaviour on the criminal's part during each of his criminal sequences of activity.) Or again, the 'specific final condition' towards which everyone now alive is moving, by many varied routes, is the condition of death, a condition which many people precipitate by their own mode of life-as though their main ambition in life were an early death, when in fact such an outcome is usually due to ignorance or fecklessness rather than to any 'death-seeking' aim (or 'instinct'). Anyone who claims that it is possible to reproduce the main features of purpose- ful activity in a machine must presumably find some way of distinguishing these 'as-if' goals from the machine's real goals : so that it makes sense to ask of a machine, " Granted that this machine has always or usually functioned in such a way as to bring about a certain result X, can we be sure that this is the machine's real task or purpose, that appear- ances are not deceptive, that what the machine is really after is not some quite different state of affairs Z ? How can we know that the machine has not got purposes and ideals of its own which transcend and possibly conflict with any of its actual attainments up to date ? " These questions presuppose that purpose is not the same as the power of producing consistent results in changing conditions, and that any results obtained can only be evaluated as successful or unsuccessful by comparison with the intentions of the agent, to see whether they are in conformity with these, or not. Further complexities arise when we recall that a person's own assessment of his achievements in relation to some goal may easily differ</page><page sequence="37">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 37 from that of an unbiassed spectator: thus a person may rest satisfied that he has scored a success when he manifestly hasn't, or may believe that he has not succeeded, when in fact he has. Unless machines can be constructed of which it is not absurd to raise such questions and distinctions as these, then it seems to me that the claim to reproduce purposeful behaviour in machines is very fragile. But as machines are at present it would be much easier to ask than to answer questions about the success or failure of a machine, in a sense which excluded an answer in terms of the efficiency of the machine as an instrument of men's actual or possible purposes. And this, surely, is the question which is implied by the description " intrinsic purposeful- ness" as applied to servo-mechanisms in the paper which I have cited above. A further difficulty is that not all purposive behaviour is of the same type as the rather simple models generally used as illustrative examples in these discussions. The examples tend to be drawn from the field of animal behaviour, such as the behaviour of cats towards mice or of snakes towards frogs : and these are compared with the behaviour of phototropic machines converging on moving luminous objects, and similar ingenuities. What is common to these examples is the existence of something having a definite space/time location which can be interpreted as the 'goal,' something which can therefore be regarded as a source of 'stimulation' for another object when it comes within the latter's 'sensitivity-range.' It is this which makes talk about control through continuous feed-back from the goal sound plausible. But the possibility of such interaction between goal and goal-seeker represents a special, and especially simple, case of purposive behaviour. If a person's goal is security in old age, or a happy marriage, or the composing of a symphony, these are not goals in the sense of existent, though distant, objects which can send out signals to the goal-seeker and correct his uncertain approach. Indeed, a person's goal may be such that it could not possibly be realised : such is the prospect for all men bent on 'squaring the circle.' The attainment of</page><page sequence="38">38 R. J. SPILSBURY. such goals, when they can be attained, is not a matter of establishing some new spatio/temporal relationship with an object which exists prior to this relationship : if I am trying to compose a symphony, this attempt does not even consist in my trying to establish a ' composer's relationship ' between myself and some existing symphony.6 Security does not stand waiting for me or eluding me at the close of middle age, exciting my appetite and guiding my steps from afar like the food which attracts a hungry rat through the maze in which it has been placed. So now the problem which arises is this : granted that in many cases of this kind we can say roughly how close a person is getting to his goal, and granted that a person in this situation isn't proceeding altogether 'blindly,' that is, he has some idea how well or how ill he is doing, what mistakes he needs to correct, and so on : granted, in short, that he is able to assess his performance in relation to his goal : How is this possible when there is no perceivable goal, no perceptual means therefore of measuring his own distance from it and deciding what changes and corrections are necessary? By what standards can the performance be assessed ? What is the performance being compared with, judged against, improved through ? What sort of metric is it which enables us to state how much progress we have made towards a state of affairs which does not exist and may never exist ? The traditional answer to these questions is that the standards and objectives against which performances are assessed are ideal standards, closely connected with the 'imaginative functions' in which Mr. Wisdom is interested. It is often said that one of the most prominent and 'pro- gressive' characteristics of men, compared with other animals, is their power of achieving a relative independence of their immediate environment ; an achievement made ' It is characteristic of goals of this kind that their attainment cannot even be pre-imagined, except in the vaguest outline. The composer who can fully imagine the music he is trying to compose hasfinished composing and achieved his goal.</page><page sequence="39">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 39 possible by their capacity for looking beyond the strictly- local pressures, interests and 'gifts' of their parishes and for forming ideal aims remotely connected with their observable surroundings and the opportunities of exploration and exploitation which these offer. If in this way they are sometimes led to form unrealistic, unrealisable goals, this is more than compensated for by their release from the precarious existence of the short-term opportunist. Oppor- tunities of satisfaction are not merely sighted and snapped up as they chance to occur: they are pre-imagined, and this pre-imagining seems to be an essential factor in their causation. Long-range strategy replaces the tactics of pounce-and-grab, and plans which would take many years to execute may be reviewed and rehearsed in a few minutes. These programmes of activity and pre-views of possibilities enable a running comparison to be maintained between achievement and aims, between promise and performance. Undoubtedly there is a dualism of a sort here, in the opposi- tion between planning and execution ; though it may be argued that this is not simply a dualism of thought and action, since the planning itself is not exempted from critical comparison with ideal standards of plan-making. Moreover, the dualism might be interpreted as empirical rather than metaphysical in nature, on the grounds that it can be resolved by a 'perfect' performance which unifies aim and achievement. Wherever the truth may lie here, the immediate problem is whether any conceivable mechanism could function so as to reproduce processes of the kind which I have sketched above. Perhaps an opening move might be to distinguish between 'introverted ' and ' extroverted ' machines. Just as there are men whose behaviour is primarily deter- mined by influences and changes impinging on them from outside, so, it may be said, there are machines which are turned outward towards their environment, well equipped with 'detector-' and ' effector- ' systems, capable of quick reaction to external changes and of the limited amount of 'internal work' needed to ensure that they maintain some specified relationship to their environment. This machine-</page><page sequence="40">40 R. J. SPILSBURY. type may be exemplified by the 'machines of action' (such as automatic torpedoes), with their power of quick adjustment of speed and direction and their incapacity for theoretical calculations which have no practical application. By contrast with these, the introvert causes little or no direct change in its environment, but undergoes periods of intense internal activity. Presumably the pure computer belongs to this class, with its restricted output-power, its canalised input-system, and its most complicated interior. Such machines have the task of carrying out a sequence of internal operations and transformations on their input- data, and show as great an indifference to the possibility of applying their. results in practice as any Fellow of Trinity. But the inner work which they do is controlled by standards of accuracy and rigour hardly to be found elsewhere (even among Fellows of Trinity). These introverts, owing to their complicated internal functioning, are more liable to breakdowns than the extroverts, and may search endlessly for solutions to insoluble problems. By combining the distinctive features of these two machine-types one might get something that could be called an 'ambivert.' This would possess a strong and varied detector-system; its internal arrangements would give it powers of combination and analysis, so that it could perform a large variety of operations and transformations on present and past inputs, stored away in its tubes ; and its powerful output system would enable it to ' work out' the results of its internal activity on its environment. For a machine of this kind there would exist the possi- bility of a relation towards its environment which might imaginatively be called a state of " mal-adjustment ": that is to say, the environment might prove unsuitable or " intractable " to those forms of modification which the machine was internally and externally equipped to bring about. As a simple example of this, in a machine more extroverted than introverted, imagine an automatic Hoover, which would explore its environment endlessly, with wider and wider sweeps, until it encountered dirt or dust, which it would then absorb into its bag and evacuate into the</page><page sequence="41">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 41 dust-bins when the bag was full-imagine such a machine set down in a dustless and dirtless environment, forever exploring and never able to carry out the work for which it was equipped. Unless it could learn to change its role or its environment, there would remain unrealised poten- tialities in the machine far in excess of its actual performance in those surroundings. No-one could guess what it was capable of doing simply by observing its overt activity in those conditions. This illustration might be used to suggest that the distinction between aim and achievement was " in principle " of the same kind as the contrast between potentiality and performance in the Auto-Hoover. Self- realisation would be a matter of actualising the individual's potentialities, of' fitting' his internal processes and powers of execution to his environmental conditions and oppor- tunities ; failure would be the condition in which this fit could not be established. But, it may be objected, this is merely to repeat the confusion between powers and purposes : Jones' ambitions may be absurdly ill-related to Jones' capacities. In no conceivable environment could he achieve them, owing to certain constitutional defects. True enough : but could not Jones perhaps be compared with an Auto-Hoover lacking an essential and irreplaceable part, its bag for instance, which kept up its hoovering, forever going through the motions of sweeping and deposit- ing dust but never effecting any change in the amount of dust lying about ? To which the reply may be given that this ignores Jones' powers of learning. Men may sometimes form absurd goals, but they are at least prepared to vary their tactics and try out new methods when the old ones fail. Thus their failures may at least be intelligent failures. As I do not wish to get involved here in a long discussion of learning in men and machines, I will not speculate further on these lines. The general implications of the suggestions sketched above will, I hope, be clear without detailed development. In broad outline, they may be summarised thus : The distinction generally made between thought and behaviour could (in principle) be paralleled</page><page sequence="42">42 R. J. SPILSBURY. in machines as a distinction (or set of distinctions) between certain of their internal functions, and their external impacts on their environments. This view assumes that the differ- ence between performance and purpose, between reality and Utopia, is not to be construed as a difference between something that exists (or has existed) and something that does not exist except as an imaginative idea 'in the mind ' : for in that case trying to bridge the gap and realise one's goal would be like trying to cross a river by means of a bridge marked on an engineer's plan but not yet built. The proper distinction, by which this absurd model must be replaced, is between inner and outer work, between the internal ' processing' of input-data (' experience') and the external operations and consequences which issue from this inner activity. The distinction between ' real ' and ' believed ' achievements might be reproduced in a machine in the way in which the results of its external work were ' signalled back' to its ' receiving-centres ' : there would exist here the possibility of signal-distortion, e.g. through interference from other internal circuits. The machine's goal might be represented by internally-produced patterns of activity which functioned as ' releasers ' of its subsequent output: and these patterns would outlast the output, so that some form of' fit' or correspondence might be estab- lished between them and the incoming energy-patterns which resulted from the machine's impact on its environ- ment. When this relationship, this hypothetical 'match,' exists between these hypothetical patterns, it may be said that the machine's design has been accomplished (provided there has been no internal distortion of the input, no inter- ference by those continuing processes which determined its output. ' Wishful thinking ' and ' illusory achievement' may come about when the input-patterns are biassed into correspondence with the output-releasing patterns through the direct influence of the latter on the former in the machine's 'cortex'?). It might even be possible, using this rather peculiar language, to suggest ways of describing and distinguishing ' accidental' achievements, and achieve- ments in which luck played no part. In the case of a lucky</page><page sequence="43">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 43 performance, one could postulate some form of independence between the machine's output (and the inner work deter- mining the output), and the results of this output which 'happened' to match the machine's internal 'designs.' For instance, there might be external factors contributing to the result which were independent of the machine's operations and which did not correspond to any of the machine's 'calculations' as represented by its previous inner work. On similar lines one might attempt to dis- tinguish between the machine's 'real' aims and ostensible aims, as inferred from its overt performances. Those who put forward speculations of this kind are entitled to claim that any model of cerebral functioning is inevitably the crudest beginner's-sketch of an unimaginably- complex scene of operations. It hardly needs stressing that any account of mental processes in terms of the inner work of a physical system is almost entirely guesswork. How could it be otherwise, when in a recent discussion a well- known physiologist and psychologist, after reviewing various physiological theories of memory, can express himself thus : "I sometimes feel, in reviewing the evidence on the localization of the memory trace, that the necessary con- clusion is that learning just is not possible. It is difficult to conceive of a mechanism which can satisfy the conditions set for it."' This comment seems to me to set in proper perspective any question of carrying through the programme of reproducing in an artifact the plan and pattern of human purposefulness. We do not know that the programme is capable of fulfilment: we do know that any theoretical proposals which can now be made will consist mainly of gaps surrounded by guesses, and we cannot even see clearly enough to be sure what sorts of guess would, if well-founded, satisfactorily fill the blanks in our hypotheses. In this spirit, and within the present speculative framework, I shall 7K. S. Lashley: "In search of the Engram," p. 477. Included in Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology, No. IV, 1950. (" Physiological Mechanisms in Animal Behaviour.") D</page><page sequence="44">44 R. J. SPILSBURY. now turn to consider the problem which Mr. Wisdom has raised, whether any conceivable mechanism could function imaginatively. Mr. Wisdom has stressed what might be called the fictitious element in imagining, when something is imagined to be occurring which is not occurring. I shall not follow him in this, since I think it better to concentrate on the more general features of imagining. In what I take to be the generic (and certainly most generous) use of the verb, I can correctly be described as imagining a snowfall in Vladivostok, irrespective of whether snow is or is not falling there at the time of my imagining (or at the time " in " my imagining), and irrespective of whether I know or believe that snow is, or is not, falling there, or am just wondering whether snow is falling there. In instances of this kind, the contrast suggested by 'imagine' is not so much the ' imaginary-real' contrast, as the difference between imagining some incident and witnessing that incident8. A person standing in Vladivostok Square and watching the snow as it slipped down could not imagine that snowfall unless he left the Square, or put up his umbrella and closed his eyes. One necessary and universal condition for the imagining of any incident seems to be that the incident in question should not be clearly and distinctly observed at the time of the imagining. It may be observable, it must not be observed. I can imagine snow in Vladivostok while listening to the B.B.C. weather report in London, and I can imagine myself hearing the B.B.C. weather report on the snow which I am observing in Vladivostok : what I cannot do is to duplicate my hearing or my seeing with a simul- '*Wisdom says that an imagined lion does not frighten in the same way as a real lion. I prefer to say that a person imagining himself in the presence of a lion is usually less alarmed than a person facing a lion in the open (unless he be a lion-tamer, etc.). The truth of this statement depends (partly) on how seriously the person takes his imagining, on what might be called his state of " image-credulity," which is not necessarily a hallucinatory state. The explorer who imagines a lion lurking in the bush near him may be tense enough if he believes in the existence of the lion and expects it to appear at any moment. Seeing the lion may in fact steady his nerve--and his aim.</page><page sequence="45">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 45 taneous imagined hearing or seeing of the same events. There is an incompatibility here which is not purely logical or tautological, a mutual interference or inhibition of one process by another, for which it seems reasonable enough to seek an explanation in the structure and functioning of man's nervous system. On the assumption that perceiving the snowfall and imagining the snowfall both involve the use of some of the same internal circuits and pathways, there would necessarily be ' competition' between the two processes, and the 'stronger' might be expected to ' drive out' or inhibit the 'weaker.' And on the assumption that the differences between perceiving and imagining can "in principle" be analysed in terms of the difference between externally-induced and internally-initiated (or internally-controlled) changes, then this interference- principle of the relationship between the two processes might conceivably be modelled in an automatic system which could be set working on partly-similar lines as a result of external or internal fluctuations ; a system con- structed on the principle that incoming disturbances (' skin contacts') would normally inhibit and take prece- dence over 'domestic' activities, so far as both of these involved the use of the same circuits. I am credulous enough to suppose that some model of this kind might possibly offer a limited analogy in respect of the incom- patibility noticed above. At any rate I do not see how this incompatibility could be explained if seeing 'in the mind's eye' and seeing with the bodily eyes were two independent processes, which could go on at the same time without possibility of interference, like blinking and sighing. The simplest (though not necessarily correct) hypothesis would seem to be that of a common brain-space and central system of functioning, which would imply the possibility of mutual inhibition. On this hypothesis, the economy of the nervous system makes impossible a power which would in any case be a pointless extravagance from the biological view, the power of simultaneous imaging and perceiving of the same events. Perceptual difficulties and inadequacies give imagining most of its biological justification, so far as D2</page><page sequence="46">46 R. J. SPILSBURY. it has any. We fall back on imagery when perception fails us in some way. There may be some philosophers who would reject all such hypothetical " explanations " of an incompatibility which they would regard as analytic.9 Their argument presumably would be that it makes no (logical) sense to say that a person might have the power of imagining something at the same time as he is observing it, since this conjunction is ruled out by the definitional meaning of " imagine." My brief answer to this objection is that definitional rules of this kind are determined by empirical observations and inferences, and not vice-versa: we could easily re-define " imagine " if we found that its current usage prevented us from saying what we wanted to say with its aid, and if our experience and observations seemed to warrant such a change. It might similarly be argued that it makes no sense to say that a person might have the power of walking faster than he could run, since " running " is defined as " a quicker form of movement than walking." This definition would not worry us if we came across a man of whom it was true that he could walk faster than he could run. On the assumption, then, that this is a genuinely-factual incompatibility, it is worth seeing how far it can be extended and generalised. There seems little doubt that it applies in the field of imaginative performances, no less than in imaginative perceiving. I cannot at the same time be carrying out some action and be imagining myself carrying out that action " with my mind's limbs and muscles." (I may, of course, be imagining some future move that I shall make, but that is a different matter.) If I wish to imagine myself driving a car, it is essential that I should not in fact be driving a car at the time when I wish to * Other philosophers might wish to include this incompatibility-statement in the class of Synthetic a prioris. On the present hypothesis, this would mean that inherited functional mechanisms of the nervous system set limits (at any given evolutionary phase) to the variety of possible experience-forms and combination.</page><page sequence="47">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 47 imagine myself in the driver's seat: or at least that I should not be conscious of driving a car at that time ; or at least that I should not be conscious of driving the same car in the same way down the same road as the car, style of driving, and route which are to be included in my imagined tour. In general, one of the necessary conditions of any imaginative experience is that there should be some appre- hended difference between a person's ' actual' state or activity, so far as he is aware of it at the time of the imagining, and the state or activity which he imaginatively assumes or experiences.'0 The impossibility of two distinct but con- comitant processes of executing a certain action and imagining oneself executing that action, would seem " in principle " capable of the same explanation as that offered for the impossibility of concomitant perceiving and imagin- ing. Both impossibilities may be traceable to the same economy of functional organisation in the brain which prevents duplication of this kind. In the case of imagined performances, there is the additional point that some of the same limbs and muscles may be exercised (or "' sub-exercised ") as would be used in the 'real show' : for instance, imagining oneself kicking a stone may involve a little of the same muscular activity as is involved in kicking a stone, so that when some real kicking is going on, the muscles are being fully employed in this and there can be no distinct imaginative experience of kicking until the full-bodied performance has ceased. The same muscles cannot at the same time be fully and slightly exercised. Are there any fuirther deductions which can be drawn from the hypothesis tentatively advanced above ? I am inclined to think there are. (For ease of exposition, I shall 10 It may be thought that this generalisation is refuted by dream-experiences: a person may dream that he is exposed and freezing when his bed-clothes have slipped down. But the statement above only refers to cases where conscious discrimination is made between " image " and " reality." To refute the statement, a dreamer would have to be simultaneously aware of two distinct experiences of cold, one of them a 'genuine' feeling, the other only a 'dream-feeling.'</page><page sequence="48">48 R. J. SPILSBURY. in what follows confine myself to the relation between perception and perceptual imagery). If the difficulties about having distinct but synchronous perceptual and imaginative experiences are to be analysed in terms of the lack of separate central circuits in the brain for these processes, then it might be expected that the closer the resemblance between the perceptions which a person was getting and the perceptions which he was trying to imagine himself getting, the greater would be the difficulty involved, owing to the increasing probability of interference or inhi- bition as the competition for common pathways became more intense. (If this sounds rather like a traffic jam in Piccadilly Circus, I cannot help it : I do not know how to express more clearly what I am-perhaps misguidedly- trying to express.) Now if my personal observations have any general validity, something like the relationship deduced above holds good. If while looking at the fire I try to imagine myself looking at a coloured screen " in my mind's eye," I find I can manage this more easily when the screen is imagined to be of some strongly-contrasting colour than when it is visualised in some shade of red, only slightly different from the colour of the fire. In the latter case, the moment of success tends to coincide with a temporary loss of distinctness in my perception of the fire-a sudden fading or blurring. (This sometimes happens also in the former case.) Compared with these ' achievements,' I find no difficulty at all in imagining myself hearing a tune or smelling an odour while observing the fire. On the other hand, when the fire is out and the gramophone is on, or the dinner is cooking, the difficulties are reversed : I find it easier to imagine the fire than any tune or smell. In short, what may be loosely called " ihnage-percept compe- tition " is at its keenest when the perception and the imagery can be grouped under the same sense-modality. And this seems to be slight evidence in favour of the hypo- thesis of common centres and circuits for imaginative and perceptual processes which are thus related. To avoid misunderstanding, I had better repeat that the only purpose of these speculations is to suggest a conceivable</page><page sequence="49">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 49 mechanism for the above-specified relationship between perceiving and imagining. I am not claiming for these amateur (and probably naive) neurological speculations any value beyond that of indicating, in broad principle rather than detail, the possibility of mechanical explana- tion; and I am far from asserting that an imaginative artifact is a conceivable possibility, for there are many other features of imaginative processes, besides those noticed above, which are difficult to understand in terms of any mechanism. I shall now turn to a consideration of some of these difficulties, with special reference to the test-case brought forward by Mr. Wisdom : the case of imaginative place-changing, in which one person thinks himself into another person's position. First, some preliminary remarks about this "place- changing," designed to show its affinity to those general features of imagining which have been noticed above. In much the same way as it is impossible for a person to imagine a scene in no way different from the scene which he is observing, so it seems impossible for a person to imagine himself in somebody else's position unless that other person's situation is recognised to differ relevantly from his own situation at the time of the imagining. There must be some imaginable difference between the situations of the two persons if the distinction between " what is imagined " and " what is really the case " is to be preserved : otherwise the rule about the " identity of indiscernibles " comes into operation, owing to the impossibility of discriminating between the imaginer's position and his imagined position. A merely-numerical diversity between two persons is not an imaginable difference. Why is it that when we imagine ourselves changing places with another person, we generally imagine changing our " performance-roles," as it were, and not merely our perceptual view-points ? Suppose, for example, I wish to imagine the snow falling in Vladivostok, I may imagine myself standing in the Square watching the snow; I would not normally imagine myself as someone else, such as Stalin, standing in the Square watching the snow;</page><page sequence="50">50 R. J. SPILSBURY. for there is no imaginable difference between Stalin's view of the snow and the view I would get, provided our perceptual equipment is assumed to be similar. Suppose, on the other hand, I want to imagine the view one gets from the top of Everest or at the bottcm of the ocean with artificial lighting, I am quite likely to include in my imaginings an outsider, such as a deTr -sea diver or mountain explorer, into whose climbing bacts or diving-suit I put myself, while trying to imagine the sort of experiences such people have. In cases of this latter kind, not only is the imagined view of an unfamiliar type, but the task of getting the view would be right outside my experience and my abilities: therefore I assist my imaginative weaknesses by pretending that I am someone else with the appropriate experience and ability. Insofar as individuals generally differ more widely in their characters, aims and predica- ments, in their powers, weaknesses and opportunities of action, than in their general range of perceptual capacity or experience, imagined changes of identity tend to be associated with the former rather than the latter. Men do not try to ' peer' through other men's eyes or 'listen' through other men's ears in the way in which they try to ' walk' in other men's shoes and ' act' in other men's dilemmas. Presumably only the blind and the deaf have dreams in which they change ears and eyes with other men. Now the question whether any conceivable mechanism could have this imaginative power of " getting inside another machine's metal " looks plainly absurd. We cannot "imagine " an arithmetical computer changing roles imaginatively with a chess-playing machine or an automatic torpedo. Of course it is possible that the absurdity here lies in certain remediable defects of present- day machines, and in our naive conceptions of " mechan- ism." However, without the gift of prophecy no-one can judge whether this is so, or not. A more promising line may be to recall that Behaviourists have a word (in fact several words) for this kind of imaginative exercise: they call it " imitation " or " impersonation "--a form of</page><page sequence="51">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 51 imitation in which most of the overt imitative activity is suppressed and inhibited. If their analysis is correct, perhaps a first step towards the construction of an imagina- tive artifact is to construct one capable of imitative behaviour. Let us therefore take a look at the conditions which such a machine must satisfy, on the provisional assumption that the Behaviourists are right. Uninhibited imitation, like its inhibited half-brother, works and relies on the differences between individuals : no impersonator can impersonate himself, or his identical twin. Or rather, he can only impersonate himself in the sense of reviving some previous or abnormal state of himself, e.g., when he was an infant in arms, or in the dentist's chair. There must be some imitable difference between his state immediately preceding the act of imita- tion, and the state which he is imitating. Now impersonation might be described as a form of attempted " duplication," to use Wisdom's term for the fundamental feature of imagination. And there are certainly many "duplicates " in the world of mass- produced articles: some of these duplicates, produced in special circumstances, are called " imitations." To be an " imitation," in this sense, is of course quite different from being an imitator, since it is the result of an extraneous act of imitation. (A partly-similar distinction is involved in saying that a boy is an " exact copy " of his father (in build, temperament, etc.), and in saying that the boy copies his father (in reading The Times, carrying a stick, etc.). To imitate someone or something involves more than having a close likeness to that thing or person, involves more than mere " duplication "11: the duplication must 11 It may also involve less. A person who is bad at impersonation may (during his impersonating act) resemble the model he is imitating far less closely than the accidental resemblance of some third person to that model, which may be the result of a " natural " and unsought likeness. It is, however, worth noticing that ease of imitation and the possibility of effective imitation depend on certain generic resemblances between imitator and imitated. If specific differences between individuals make imitation possible, generic likenesses facilitate it. It is easier for a man to give a convincing imitation of another man than of his dog, easier again for him to imitate his dog than his car. The same principle applies in the manufacture of imitation- articles. D3</page><page sequence="52">52 R. J. SPILSBURY. have come about through the appropriate relationship between imitator and imitated, in which the latter's appear- ance or behaviour is taken as a model by the former. I am not necessarily imitating my neighbour, nor he me, if we both take the same papers and trade with the same grocer. So, if machines capable of imitative behaviour are to be constructed, it will not be sufficient to provide a number of machines that are exact replicas of one another: such replication would in fact preclude the possibility of imita- tion. Nor will it do to construct a batch of machines designed to pass automatically through a similar sequence or cycle of operations, but with differential timing: so that, if each machine's operation-cycle consists of four distinct phases, A, B, C, D, then by the time Machine I has got to phase D, Machine II is at Machine I's preceding phase, C, Machine III is at Machine II's preceding phase, B, and so on ; such an arrangement could not possibly be regarded as showing that Machine II was imitating Machine I and Machine III imitating Machine II, since each machine's sequence of changes might be proceeding inde- pendently of the rest, and it is a minimum requirement for the truth of the statement, " X imitates Y," that Y's real or supposed characteristics and behaviour are the main determinants of the form taken by X's behaviour. Most infants pass through similar stages of development, but they are not all imitating slightly older infants. (If they were, a " First-Infant" problem would arise concerning the initiation of these behaviour-changes !) Now this difficulty might, I suppose, be overcome by constructing a pair of toys, Alpha and Beta, with a common range of possible movements, and by equipping Beta with various mechanisms which would ensure that whenever it was within Alpha's sphere of influence any movements or changes of movement on Alpha's part would cause corresponding changes in Beta's movements, after a short interval of' adjustment' in the latter. If such toys could be built, Alpha's movements would not merely precede similar movements in Beta ; they would also be the main extraneous determinant of Beta's movements. We might</page><page sequence="53">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 53 be tempted to say that Alpha was the leader of Beta, and that Beta was playing the game of " Follow my leader." The question is whether we should succumb to this tempta- tion. Would it be totally misleading and inaccurate to say that Beta was imitating Alpha, and if so, why ? I have not time to deal fully with this question, but will mention some of the objections which might naturally be made. First, it may be said that at most, Beta is only capable of a very limited and rudimentary form of face-to-face (" dial-to-dial ") imitation: whereas a human being can impersonate another human being in his absence. (In fact, the impersonator may never have seen or heard the person being impersonated, or a reproduction of his appearance and behaviour. This might be called " imitation by description "). However, I am prepared to concede that " in principle " this objection might be overcome, by giving Beta some internal " storage "-arrangements and the power of initiating its movement-patterns from within, as a result of internally-stored " traces " of Alpha's past behaviour in Beta's " presence." Thus equipped, Beta might, at irregular intervals and in the absence of Alpha, execute a sequence of movements which would resemble previous sequences executed by Alpha : so that the latter might be termed the " origin " of Beta's movements so lQng as this causal con- nection remained. Next, it may be argued that if we use " imitation " in connection with Alpha's and Beta's movements, we have no possible way of deciding between the following hypotheses: (a) That Beta is imitating Alpha's past behaviour. (b) That Alpha is imitating Beta's ' anticipated' behaviour. (c) That they are both imitating one another. (d) That neither of them is imitating the other, but both imitating some common model (or similar models). Here again I am prepared to believe that some way might be found of deciding between these hypotheses in any concrete case, by observing how the movements of the one affect, or fail to affect, the movements of the other, as a result of their internal functioning and feed-back mechanisms. In any</page><page sequence="54">54 R. J. SPILSBURY. case, it is often difficult for an observer to decide between these hypotheses when Alpha and Beta are not toys but human beings, and when the observer is neither Alpha nor Beta. Further complaint might be made about the rigidity and artificially ad hoc character of Beta's behaviour, consisting in the stereotyped reproduction of the limited number of movements included by its designer in its imita- tive repertoire, without the power of adding to this reper- toire as it moved among the Gammas and Deltas of its world. But this, after all, is a limitation which Beta shares to some extent with many of its human counterparts, whose imitations are painfully stereotyped and unvarying; the question is not whether Beta can be described as a good imitator, but whether it can be described as any sort of imitator. It is necessary to make sure that the " ground floor" of human abilities can be reproduced in a toy, before worrying about the higher storeys. Beta should be judged by the standards of ordinary human competence and incompetence, rather than those of the brilliant per- former. I have left to the last the objection which seems to me both the hardest to formulate and the hardest to meet. This is the objection that Beta's behaviour cannot be described as " imitative " in any human sense, since this would imply that the resemblance of its movements to Alpha's movements was an intended resemblance, and that its performance was a voluntary one, or if not voluntary, then involuntary. But it would be meaningless either to assert or deny that Beta's movements were voluntary, since we have no means, even " in principle," of distin- guishing between instances of its voluntary behaviour and instances of its involuntary behaviour. In the case of human behaviour, we may find it difficult to give any precise analysis of what we mean when we use these terms, but we can at least take concrete examples of behaviour- situations and arrange them in a kind of scale of decreasing 'voluntariness,' according to certain implicitly-recognised criteria. For instance, in the case of imitative behaviour,</page><page sequence="55">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 55 at the top of the scale one could put the example of the boy who impersonates his masters, for the fun of it ; and near the bottom of the scale, the man who yawns when all around him yawn, or the way in which panic, violence and hysteria take possession of a crowd, spreading outwards from some common disturbance centre ; or the way in which the spectators at an athletic contest reflect in their bodily movements their involuntary participation in the exertions which they are witnessing. And there are various intermediate types which we would wish to distinguish, though we might be uncertain where to place them in the scale : the imitative behaviour of the person acting under external pressure and physical constraint, of the person fighting against the influence of some powerful exemplar but nevertheless succumbing to it, of the person unaware how deeply indebted he is to forgotten models, of the person hypnotized into a state of imitative compliance. It may be a mistake to try to fit these and various other types and conditions of imitative behaviour into the same logical scale or continuum ; perhaps several scales are required, corresponding to different dimensions in the field bounded at its extremities by the opposing poles of fully-voluntary and wholly-involuntary behaviour. But in any case, it is extremely difficult to see how similar problems of logical scaling and discrimination could arise in the case of a toy's behaviour-patterns, which all seem to be on the same logical level, as it were. It is certainly no solution to this problem to equip Beta with some sort of " Uncertainty " mechanism, so that its individual performances are random, though predictable en masse. To confuse randomly- produced motions with voluntary behaviour is as bad an error as to identify chance combinations of ideas or numbers with the creative work of thinkers and mathematicians. There is a difference between an original thinker and a perfect randomizer or permuting-system ; there is also a difference between a voluntary act and one which is the outcome of some form of internal lottery. When we say of some action that it was performed voluntarily, one thing we do not mean is that it was determined by the</page><page sequence="56">56 R. J. SPILSBURY. result of some prior process of mental (or mechanical) coin-tossing. I do not think that any amount of ingenuity is at present likely to overcome this difficulty at all convincingly. But even if it could be overcome, there would still remain the problem of the transition from uninhibited imitation to those purely-imaginative processes which involve none of the overt features of imitative behaviour. The problem here is whether any Behaviouristic analysis of imaginative place-changing can be accepted. One way in which it can be made to appear plausible is by concentrating on examples of what I shall call " shallow " imagining, in which one person A tries to put himself into the position of another person B solely in respect of those features or activities of B which could be photographed. For instance, a golfer may imagine himself as Henry Cotton, so far as Cotton's driving stance or putting style are concerned. This kind of imagining could quite plausibly be described as a weakened and diluted form of the corresponding act of full-bodied imita- tion, especially when it is accompanied by slight 'muscular tensions of the same kind as those involved in the full imitation. Logically speaking, of course, there is no xeason why we should not reverse this procedure and start with the assumption of a purely-imaginative " inner play" which sometimes flows outwards into full-fledged imitative behaviour and sometimes is " blocked " so that it either does not emerge into behaviour at all or merely 'leaks' out in a scarcely-perceptible trickle. However, I shall not argue this point, since on either view there is a close relation- ship between imagining and imitating. It is more important to consider whether all imaginative place-changing is of this shallow kind, and if not, whether in these other cases there is the same close relationship with imitative activities. Suppose a golfer tries to put himself more comprehensively, more " deeply," into Cotton's position when Cotton first won the " Open," this involves much more than an imagi- native re-enactment of Cotton's winning stroke-play, and the hand-shaking which followed. It involves trying to imagine things which it would be nonsense to expect to</page><page sequence="57">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 57 see in any news-reel which showed the events at the last hole during and after the winning stroke. It involves, among other things, trying to imagine how Cotton thought and felt on that occasion. While he was acknowledging the cheers and congratulations of the crowd, maybe he was thinking back to his previous failures, maybe thinking forward to future goals, or thinking perhaps of his wife's part in his success, or of his defeated rivals ; feeling pro- bably great relief from the preceding strain and tension, or possibly a sudden weariness, even disinterest in the whole affair. The point here is not whether such imaginings are logically respectable or anything more than wild guesses, but whether, whatever their logical credentials, they can be regarded as inhibited imitative tendencies. I do not see how they can, for there seems to be no corresponding act of full-bodied imitation to be inhibited. I do not know how one can *give an overt imitation of a man thinking of his wife, or represent in this way the difference between a man recalling yesterday's achievements and a man anti- cipating future glories. Imagining how another man thinks or feels is not an anaemic imitation, from which all the energy and movement have been drained away: for it is not any sort of imitation. Photographs of Cotton may enable me to give a (poor) imitation of his driving stance and style, but they would not enable me to give any imita- tion, strong or weak, of the way in which he decides what tactic to adopt in playing a difficult hole, or the way in which he visualises the path of his ball before hitting it. So I do not think that any possible success which engineers might claim in the construction of imitative machines would help at all with this problem of deep imagination. But finally, let us suppose these objections overcome, let us concede that there may be a form of " deep imitation " in terms of which these imaginative processes can be analysed. Let it be ruled that one machine A can be said to change places imaginatively with another machine B when A's internal state and activity-pattern duplicate B's, and when this deep internal duplication of B in A comes about as the result of processes in A analogous</page><page sequence="58">58 R. J. SPILSBURY. to those which enable it to imitate the overt behaviour of B. (A's power of overt imitation is assumed in the present argument.) How this internal duplication could be brought about, I do not know ; possibly on the basis of a constant relationship. between B's external and internal states, and feed-back arrangements in A causing it to duplicate B's internal state when B's corresponding external state is presented (or re-presented) to it in some way. I have no idea whether the construction of such a machine is a tech- nical possibility, but for the sake of argument assume that it is. The position is then that machine A has the power of internally duplicating certain of the internal states and processes of machine B. (This would imply close structural similarities between the two machines, but the same kind of limitation seems to apply to human imagining. I cannot confidently imagine what it would be like to change places with my dog.) The question is whether the relationship between the two machines, which has been sketched above, can reason- ably be regarded as supplying a close analogy to the imaginative attitude of one person to another, when the one is thinking himself into the position of the other. I think it fairly clear that it cannot be so regarded. For not only is the duplication of another person's thoughts and feelings an unnecessary condition or concomitant of trying to imagine how that person feels and thinks: it is also a counter-condition which rules out the possibility of such imagining. Unless there is some difference between my state of mind and another's, I cannot be imagining myself in his condition, since our conditions are the same. If when I am expecting bad news I see a close friend approaching with grief written on his face, the effect of his expression on my feelings may possibly be such as to assimilate them to his feelings ; but in that case I am not imagining myself in his condition, since we are both in the same condition. Here I find myself in full agreement with Mr. Wisdom, who has made a similar point. So by a somewhat devious route I have reached much the same conclusion as my predecessor in this symposium :</page><page sequence="59">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 59 that there are apparently insoluble problems (not merely technological) which in our present information-state rule out the possibility of designing an artifact which will possess quite ordinary human qualities and capacities, let alone creative powers and insight. This is not a very exciting conclusion ; there is a temptation to go further and dismiss the whole idea as fantastic nonsense. Fantastic it certainly is, but if it is nonsense, it is empirical nonsense and can hardly be exposed a priori, by force of pure logic and analysis alone. The basic weakness of all empirical arguments against the possibility of a thinking artifact lies in their own inherent uncertainty, which is the necessary con- sequence of our profound lack of understanding of the principles and conditions of man's so-called mental processes. The one-thing of which I feel reasonably certain is that the problem which has been sampled in the latter half of this paper, the problem about imagination, is not a " gadget "- problem and will never be solved by equipping existing types of machine with some extra device or modification. Any gadget-approach to this problem would be doomed for much the same reason as the reifications in the old (or the new) " Faculty " psychologies, in which imagination is regarded as a separate mental entity or power or disposi- tion. This view, if true, would much simplify the problem, since it would make possible a piecemeal, Faculty-by- Faculty approach to the task of giving to a machine those various powers of which the sum total is " mind." I cannot here deploy the arguments against this view, and can only assert dogmatically that the fundamental problems in this field are indivisible, in the sense that they cannot be properly understood or even formulated if insulated from one another in ways suggested to us by our language-habits. Finally, let me conclude with a quotation from Spinoza, who seems to me to have said the wisest last words on this matter : " No one has so far determined what the body is capable of, that is, no one has yet been taught by experience what the body is capable of doing merely from the laws of Nature alone, insofar as Nature is considered as purely physical nature, and what it cannot do, unless determined</page><page sequence="60">60 R. J. SPILSBURY. by the mind. For no one has acquired such accurate knowledge of the fabric of the body as to be able to explain all its functions."12 This leaves the question properly open to the possibility of fresh debate in some future Symposium during the Joint Session which will (I hope) be held a hundred years hence. 12 Spinoza, Ethics, Pt. III, Prop. II. Note. Quoted by Stuart Hampshire, Spinoza, p. 130.</page><page sequence="61">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. III.-By D. M. MACKAY. 1. Ground-Clearing. 1.1. We seem to be in danger of confusing two questions. The first concerns the extent to which a suitably-designed artefact, embodying only combinations of physical processes now known, could provide evidence of mentality comparable with that acceptable from human beings. The second concerns the likelihood that if we knew enough of the structure and internal functioning of the brain, and if we were able to design an artefact on similar lines, we might be able to attribute mentality to the artefact. The second doubly-speculative question I regard as at present irrelevant, for we lack adequate data even to consider it properly, and it raises only a special case of the general problem of our title. We have, of course, first-hand evidence of mentality only in association with human brains; and mere functional equivalence between a would-be model and the brain would be (and has been) a curse to the neurologist. It would, however, be at best an arbitrary decision to deny mentality to any organism, artificial or otherwise, until it could be shown to function in the same way as the human brain that we may never fully understand, and I shall not attempt to smoke out anyone who takes refuge in such a denial. 1.2. The first question is open to factual discussion in our present state of knowledge. We are, of course, limited as to the certainty of any inferences from the behaviour of either a man or an artefact; but our limitation to observable data in principle allows both the examination of the internal functioning of a mechanism, and the whole class of evidence and insight obtainable from dialogue, so that we may and must be as ingeniously critical in the one case as in the other. E</page><page sequence="62">62 D. M. MACKAY. It is important, I think, to be clear as to the distinction between this deductive task which confronts us and speculation. " Gaps surrounded by guesses " can arise from our inability to carry deduction far enough; but they are then sub- stitutes for competence. If they arise by way of extrapola- tion where factual evidence is lacking, they must be framed with due and explicit caution. Our task, as I understand it, necessitates no guesses of either kind. 1.3. The term " behaviour " has a special psychological use which would here be slightly question-begging, and may have caused some confusion. I should make it clear, therefore, that I used it in the paper quoted by Messrs. Wisdom and Spilsbury (Ref. 1; hereafter referred to as M.B.A.) to refer non-committally to all that goes on in an artefact, internally and externally-as in ordinary usage where one speaks of the " behaviour " of a physical or mathematical system. What Mr. Spilsbury calls an " ambiverted " mechanism is, I think, the kind that most writers on this subject take as their starting-point. " Activity " (in preference to " behaviour ") will here be used throughout in the non-committal sense defined above. 1.4. As a final caveat, anyone who thinks of an artefact " equipping itself with a mind " as having to entice into its wiry depths (empty, swept and garnished) some numinous denizen, is raising, I think, another question1. 1.5. With these provisos in mind, I propose to defend the thesis that no barrier of principle prevents an artefact (embodying only processes now known) from satisfying the tests suggested by the foregoing speakers-nor, indeed, rather more searching ones. From a discussion of purpose we shall pass to consider the kind of artefact that could possess and show imagination. A brief reference to choice and volition and the status of these concepts as exemplified in the activity of our artefact will lead us out to what I believe to be the real frontier of our present ignorance. 2. Goal-directed activity and purpose. Gospel according to Matthew, xii: 43-45.</page><page sequence="63">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 63 2.1. Definitions. The wealth of points raised by my predecessors in the matter of purposeful behaviour can, I think, be answered best by attempting to clarify general principles and then looking round for any cases not covered by these. I hold no brief for other people's terminology, and will confine myself mainly to elucidation of the criteria used in M.B.A. The most relevant passages are as follows (pp. 106-107):- " One of the most distinctive features of an organism is that of goal-directed activity. Associated with this feature are a group of concepts such as purpose, control and the like, which cease to have meaning in its absence. To avoid committing anthropomorphism--one of the two currently unforgivable sins-we may define the statement 'A seeks the goal X' as follows: Let the current state of A (plus its environment) be defined as Y. Let X define that state of A-plus-environment which we term the goal of A. Then the statement above implies that the activity of A in a defined group of circumstances is such as inter alia to minimize the discrepancy between X and Y," . . . " or some time- average of the interval " (between two corresponding points X and r symbolising X and Y in an abstract representation). The following points, I think, are clear:- (1) Goal-directed activity is defined as a necessary though not as a sufficient feature of situations revealing purpose, but anthropomorphic reference is specifically (if somewhat ironically) disclaimed, the intention being to provide a neutral term which could be used without begging the question of its relation to human purposefulness. (2) The goal X is here defined as a state, not as a physical object. There is no question of the goal emitting physical signals, and examples of people seeking non-existent goals- e.g., trying to square the circle-can cause difficulty only if two common senses of the term " goal " are confused, namely, (1) something to be attained, (2) the state of having attained it. My definition goes on to suggest that a state E2</page><page sequence="64">64 D. M. MACKAY. can be represented formally by a " thing "-the point which represents it in an abstract descriptive-space-so that sub- sequent discussion applies to " goals " in both senses2. (3) What is fed back is not information from the goal, but information as to the magnitude of the discrepancy between the current state and the goal-state (M.B.A., p. 106). In terms of mechanism it is the magnitude represented by this information which is minimized. This covers Mr. Spilsbury's point that A must act in the way that '' seems likely " to minimize the actual physical interval. As pointed out in M.B.A. (p. 107), computing operators of any complexity may be included in the feedback-path. 2.2. Process and Product. Mr. Spilsbury has criticized my definition on the grounds that A's action may lead regularly to other end-results than X-for example, a criminal may unintentionally but habitually minimize the average interval separating him from prison. This criticism reveals a misunderstanding of the nature of my " variational " definition, for which I cannot escape some responsibility. When a mathematician says " the system will behave in such a way as to minimize Ax " he means that any change in the system which would increase Ax will evoke a reaction tending to oppose the increase. [For example, a ball at the foot of a hemispherical bowl will behave in such a way as to minimize its (mean) distance from the bottom. Displace it slightly and it will tend to roll back.] Now, of course, by sitting down and watching a system one can see only the effects of whatever variations occur naturally. The diagnostic test is to try to vary Ax itself. If Ax is the interval (x1 - x2) between a system (represented by xa) and its goal (x2), then displacing x2 (in both directions !) is diagnostic. If one is in doubt about a spurious " goal " x,, the test is to move x, towards or away from x1. (Try ofering your criminal a prison sentence !) 2 I now think that it would have been better to make explicit the distinction before circumventing it.</page><page sequence="65">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 65 I am glad that Mr. Spilsbury has raised this matter, as there may well be others to whom the intended usage was not obvious. It would improve the definition in this respect if " a defined group of circumstances " were replaced explicitly by " circumstances occasioning or increasing a discrepancy between X and Y ". 2.3. Control and the circulation of information. The term " directed " can have either (i) the passive sense of " oriented " or (ii) the active sense of " guided ". Our variational definition covers activity which is goal- directed in either sense3, and a pair of illustrations may serve to clarify the important distinction otherwise (and often) overlaid. (a) Water, as we say, seeks its own level. A certain river is blocked by a landslide. It rises until it over- flows the barrier, and so continues on its way. Its activity, like that of the ball in the bowl, could be called goal-directed, but only in sense (i). (b) Another river is blocked, but this time a water- level indicator transmits a control-signal that opens sluices and so arrests the rise in level. Here the activity of the system as a whole is goal-directed in sense (ii), because there is a distinguishable process of control. Why can we not say in the same sense that the rise of level in (a) " controlled " the release of the water ? The reason, I think, is that to speak of A as " controlling the corrective reaction R to a situation S " implies that A reacted thus because he (or it) had received information as to S; this, in turn, suggests that if information had not been received, the reaction R need not have occurred. " Control " not only implies corrective reaction, but the conceptual possibility of its absence owing to lack of information. Unless there is a separate information-path which could conceivably be interrupted, the concept of control is inapplicable and the reaction could perhaps best be described 3 Although in M.B.A., only sense (ii) was considered.</page><page sequence="66">66 D. M. MACKAY. as " Newtonian ". Where it makes sense to ask: " What if information as to S failed to reach the control ? "-then the reaction can be goal-directed in sense (ii). Where a corrective mechanism is such that the cause of reaction can in principle be removed only by removing its problem, its activity cannot be so described. In short (cf. M.B.A., p. 106), thee circulation of information is an essential pre- requisite (though not alone definitive) of goal-directed activity in sense (ii). We shall henceforward use the latter term exclusively in this sense. 2.4. Purpose. So far we have avoided the use of the term " purpose "4 Mr. Spilsbury suggests that we are entitled to describe A's activity as " purposeful " only when it makes sense to ask whether X was A's " real " goal. We have seen (2.2) that this is no serious restriction in principle, since a diagnostic (if sometimes rather impracticable) criterion always exists. If I understand Mr. Spilsbury's suggestion, it implies that purposefulness is predicable of any activity in which the goal is unambiguous. We have seen that one reason for ambiguity is an inadequate variational test; but there may be others. Let us consider, for example, a man pursuing an agile insect. If we give the insect a small displacement in the approved variational manner, we shall doubtless observe evidence that the man's goal is " contact between his hand and the insect ". But if I accidentally tread on the insect he will probably cease his pursuit. What was his " real " goal ? Here we uncover a subtle point. The variational criterion tells us only how to test a goal-not how to discover which goal to test. It tells us correctly that " insect-contact'" was a goal for the man until I trod on the insect; but only our ingenuity in framing hypotheses (aided, of course, 4 We may note by way of dismissal that " purpose ", like " directed ", has both an active and a passive sense. In the passive sense of " function " it can be predicated of almost anything, and its use sometimes leads to confusion, as when pontifical statements are made that " the only purposes a machine can have are the purposes of its designer ". Here we use it in its active sense of" intention ".</page><page sequence="67">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 67 by conversational or other clues) could lead us to apply the variational test to the goal of " freedom from insect-bite ". This disadvantage is common to all" definitions by test ". "X is the man who wears yellow braces" defines X uniquely (assuming that no one else in the crowd wears yellow braces) but it leaves us to find our own reasons for picking our examinees. Discovering a man's " real " goal is thus an inductive activity which may never lead to certainty, and we must accept the same limitation in the study of our artefact. We can with normal luck spot a man's immediate goal and apply our variational test to it; and we can eliminate any number of pseudo-goals by the same test. But his immediate goal may itself be a means to a higher-order goal, to which observation could give a clue only over a much longer period. In general, in fact, we must recognize that human purposes are normally hierarchically ordered; so that just as in a simple case activity is abandoned when the goal is achieved, so in a hierarchy the lower-order goals are abandoned when a higher-order goal is achieved. Goals may be modified in response to information on their success as means to higher-order ends, in just the same way as actions are modified in the simple case. There is no difficulty in arranging a similar hierarchical ordering of goals in an artefact. We require only to allow higher-order feedbacks to control selective mechanisms operating on the range of lower-order goals within the scope of the artefact. 2.5. The sufficiency of feedback. We should expect that most higher-order goals would be defined in abstract terms rather than by physical objects. Let us return, for example, to Mr. Spilsbury's " method of squaring the circle ". A man or artefact seeking to square the circle is kept in activity by recurrent evidence from his test-procedure that his latest method does not work: his response to the feedback of this information (as to the discrepancy between " the outcome of my present</page><page sequence="68">68 D. M. MACKAY. method " and "a squared circle ") is to try new methods -to adopt new subsidiary purposes. I think it is clear that feedback (strictly, negative feed- back) is essential for all such purposive behaviour, even when goals are abstractions without space-time location. Were it conceivable that our man should hit on a successful circle-squaring method, we should doubt that he really had this as his goal unless its attainment made some difference to his activity-either halting his efforts or at least arresting his normal reach for the wastebasket. It is less certain that the presence of such feedback is sufficient to ensure that behaviour will merit the adjective " purposeful " in its human sense. It is certainly sufficient to ensure goal-directed activity; but Mr. Spilsbury will not allow that a goal-directed torpedo has shown " purpose " if it makes no sense to ask whether the outcome of its run conformed to its " real " purpose. This seems largely a matter of convention, and I am not clear as to the kind of evidence that would be acceptable. If we take the view that any purpose attributable to an artefact must have some symbolic physical representation in some feature of its control-system, we can be fairly confident in asserting that the only (active) purpose of the torpedo is to make contact with its target. No other apparent goal (e.g., the resultant explosion) satisfies the variational test in a conventional torpedo. Mr. Spilsbury's test-question then " makes sense ", and the torpedo shows " purposeful " behaviour. Alternatively, a case might be made for attributing " purpose " only to an artefact with hierarchically-ordered goals, able to behave in ways more characteristic of human intelligent goal-seeking. I cannot see that the linguistic convention is of vital importance, provided that organism and artefact are submitted to the same tests and judged by the same criteria. In leaving this part of our subject I venture to suggest that Mr. Spilsbury's quotation of Lashley's remarks-out of context-is misleading if it is thought to controvert our general contention. Lashley had claimed that learned</page><page sequence="69">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 69 reactions could survive lesions which should have destroyed them if current physiological theories of memory were correct. Far from suggesting that no mechanism was conceivable which would function like the brain, he was only lamenting that the conditions to be met by any mechanism purporting to be a model of the brain were so stringent. We are left, in fact, still no nearer to a factual answer to my predecessors' question, whether any conceivable mechanism (using known principles) could function so as to reproduce processes of the kind they have sketched. It is, of course, no part of our aim to " carry through the programme of reproducing in an artefact "-with, perhaps, 1010 elements !-" the plan and pattern of human purpose- fulness ". But we cannot be content with only a rhetorical dismissal of the possibility in principle which is now in question. 3. A Statistical Perceptive Mechanism. Let us take as a peg for ideas a possible perceptive mechanism which there is reason to believe may have some parallels with that of the human brain. It contains in principle nothing not implicit or explicit in M.B.A., but the full implications of the latter have not apparently been realised, and I shall here try to elucidate those specially relevant to my predecessors' discussion. 3.1. Statistical predictability and valuational feedback. Consider then an artefact comprising a very large inter- locked population of elementary units (elements), each capable of sending out a signal (excitation) in response to a sufficient stimulus. Let us suppose that each element possesses a controllable " threshold " (roughly, has a variable resistance) to stimulation, such that the larger the total stimulus is in relation to the effective threshold, the greater is the probability of response by the element. A given element may have many input-paths for stimuli, and as many effective thresholds, which we will suppose to be individually controllable. Some elements may be spon- taneously active, others not; others again may respond by altering only thresholds in their topological neighbourhood.</page><page sequence="70">70 D. M. MACKAY. The behaviour of an element is thus only statistically predictable. This must not, however, be interpreted to imply the possibility of observing predictable frequencies in a time-series, for the probabilities of excitation are adjustable from moment to moment, and may change significantly during an interval in which no excitation occurs. " Probability " here, as in statistical mechanics, may be interpreted as "frequency in an ensemble of similar systems " but not as "frequency in the time-series of the given system ". When we describe the activity of such a system as statistically predictable, therefore, we mean that the probability-distributions governing it undergo transformations which are predictable in principle-not that we shall necessarily observe any sequences with significantly predict- able frequencies. To take a homely illustration, the probability that a given balloon will burst may depend in quite a calculable way on the pressure inside it; but we do not need to suppose, as apparently.Mr. Wisdom does, that the change in probability occasioned by a change in pressure is meaningless unless we can observe a change in a " frequency of explosion ". Let us not go too far, however; by claiming that a system is statistically predictable we do mean that if identical situations (identical in all important respects both as to the system and its environment) recur often enough, we should be able to predict, with greater or less precision, the relative frequencies of responses. This, in fact, seems to be part of what we mean by saying "A tends to react thus in situation S ". We shall not be incredulous if A does not, but we expect a preponderance of A's reactions to be of the stated kind in a series of similar situations S. The factor of learning or taking experience into account comes in precisely at this point. Operationally it implies that the relative probabilities of possible responses depend, inter alia, on the results of previous responses. In general, then, the probability of the next event in a given class may be different from that of its predecessor-the ultimate despair of a frequency-correlator.</page><page sequence="71">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 71 Returning to our artefact, we may suppose it equipped with well-understood means of receiving data from some field or fields and of carrying out a variety of activities in those fields. Thus information as to the results of its activities is fed back to it, and if the information is in a suitable form for assimilation the artefact can be designed to engage in goal-directed activity in those fields. Feedback has two possible ways of controlling activity here-by making corrective additions to the input, or by adjusting thresholds and so governing the probabilities of different courses of action. As this second process provides one of the main conceptual building-bricks that we shall use, a simple mechanical illustration may be forgiven. Picture a long, straight, sloping runway, whose lower end loses its side-walls and tapers in width to a long knife- edge. Imagine a succession of small balls rolled down the runway. At the end they must eventually fall off the knife-edge, falling to right or left more or less at random if the transverse axis of the runway is horizontal and so forth. If, however, we slightly tilt the transverse axis one way, the probability will increase that a ball will drop to the left; if the other way, to the right. The tilt of the axis can in fact be considered as an operational symbol for the corresponding probability. On each side of the knife-edge imagine a beam-balance, each normally collecting all the balls falling on its side in one of its pans, P1 say. Then, as balls roll down the runway and out on to the knife-edge and off to left or right, the pans P1 on both balances would normally descend steadily. Suppose, however, that on one side, say the left, we place a target T, in the form of a funnel which deflects all balls falling left into the other pan P2 of the left-hand balance. P2 on the left will now begin to descend steadily. We can say in fact that when T is on the left, P2 on the left descends; when T is not on the left, P2 on the left rises. The movement of P2 evaluates the success, of the balls that fall on its own side, in striking the target T. Let us now introduce valuational feedback, by linking each P2 mechanically to the corresponding side of the</page><page sequence="72">72 D. M. MACKAY. runway. Thus, if P2 of the left-hand balance descends, it slightly lowers the left-hand edge of the runway so as to increase the probability that the next ball will fall on the left, and conversely. Evidently each time the target is hit, the probability is now increased that it will be hit again unless it moves. After a (controllable) number of trials the mechanism will in fact concentrate solely on the left-hand side where the target is. If now T is moved to the right- hand side, the device will clearly in time readjust its " thresholds " so as to drop balls on the right. More generally, if T divides its time between left and right in certain proportions, the arrangement can be such that the probabilities of falling left or right are automatically adjusted to match the relative frequencies of the movements of T. The principle is readily generalised for any number of alternatives. I think it can be shown, in fact, that valuational feedback on thresholds suffices in a hierarchically ordered system to reproduce the features of all common types of learning. But these and other possibilities are not here our concern. 3.2. Perception by matching-response. The question here raised is that of concept-handling in such an artefact. In what physical form-by what kinds of symbols-could abstract concepts be represented, and how could we give meaning to any assertion as to what the artefact believes? Even more important, how far can we go towards rendering it (for its interpretation of data) independent of built-in categories ? Can it abstract for itself significant features of its flux of data, and so form as well as handle concepts ? The physical representation of concepts which I think can most readily meet such requirements, and at the same time match such few data as we have on the human psycho- physiological side, is very different from that used in digital computers5. Its essential features were described in 5 I emphasize this because it seems extraordinarily hard to dislodge the idiom of digital computing technique (with whatever limitations it may have) from the minds of those who address themselves critically to our subject. I venture to believe that however closely a digital computer may in principle parallel the functions of the brain, it executes most of these in a quite different manner. Mr. Wisdom has drawn attention to a similar point.</page><page sequence="73">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 73 principle in M.B.A. (p. 114). Perception is regarded as an act of internal response to recepta-specifically, a self- guided matching-response (by mechanisms readily envisaged) which minimizes some parameter of disequilibrium or mis- match between the recepta on the one hand and an internal configuration or state of elements in the appropriate region of the population on the other. In the internal processes of the artefact, the physical activity whereby a receptum is matched6 now functions as the internal representative or symbolic correlate of the corresponding percept. But we have not finished. In general a variety of internal response-patterns could match a given input- pattern of recepta sufficiently well to meet a test having finite precision. In fact, we may envisage a fairly low and variable discrimination in the estimator of mismatch or disequilibrium; we may also suppose that many different attempted responses may be evoked in parallel among different subgroups of the population, so that in our statistical mechanism the same input-pattern will not necessarily evoke identical matching-responses on successive occasions. Its perceptual activity is selective and may single out different abstractions from the input at different times. How, then, can we imagine such a process leading to the association of a unique physical correlate with a signifi- cantly invariant feature of the recepta ? Here, again, "valuational feedback on thresholds" provides the key. By arranging that (roughly speaking) the chances of evocation of response-sequences are controlled by their past success in matching recepta, we can obviously ensure that those sequences which have in the statistical scramble scored a greater frequency of success as matching- responses, will become differentially more likely to be evoked. In fact, they will acquire permanent physical representation, each being represented by the whole configura- tion of thresholds which contribute to its probability of evocation. 6 Perhaps a less confusing term than "replicated" (M.B.A. loc. cit.). It should be remembered that the matching procedure must be such that transformations under which the percept is invariant shall not affect its success. A simple example was given in M.B.A.</page><page sequence="74">74 D. M. MACKAY. Now a high frequency of success implies normally a high frequency of past recurrence of the corresponding feature of the recepta. Hence our artefact's repertoire of matching- responses-its internal symbolic vocabulary-will tend to contain mainly representations of most-frequently occur- ring percepts. In other words, it concentrates on things likely to be worth representing'. Taking stock at this point we note that in the artefact, as in man, perception is distinguished from reception by the element of attention. I receive a myriad data through eyes, ears, and other organs; I perceive only a changing selection of these-those by which my attention is momen- tarily attracted, as we say. The same selective action occurs in our artefact. Now a percept becomes a datum for current thought; its perception has altered the totality of " what I believe to be the case ". When I have once perceived X, my thinking cannot in every respect be as if I had not. In our artefact likewise we must ensure that perception can be followed by the consequences of percep- tion, internal or external. In other words, we must have coupling between perceptual activity and other responsive activity if the artefact is to act as if it believes what it has perceived; and without going into detail, I think it is evident that the same type of self-guiding statistical coupling can supplement whatever degree of deterministic coupling we wish to introduce, so as to give the plasticity and adaptive- ness that characterize the link between perception and action (mental or physical) in human thought. In short, our artefact's acts of perception are of a piece with its other acts, and the probabilities of transition from an act of perception to one of its possible consequences can be developed and moulded by a mechanism similar to that by which any learned sequence of responses can be built up. The total of what the artefact " believes " is defined by the total " matrix of transition-probabilities " 'Frequency of recurrence can, of course, be supplemented by other criteria of significance, so that an important thing perceived only in a single glimpse could acquire permanent representation in this way. We are only skimming the surface of the technicalities.</page><page sequence="75">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 75 specifying statistically its reaction-sequences in all relevant circumstances. To make the physical representative or internal symbol8 for a percept the internal matching response evoked thereby, solves several of the dilemmas posed by my predecessors. But before we turn to consider these, we may note that it also finds an encouraging consonance with a great mass of data on causes of asphasia and kindred disorders of concept-handling in human beings, and with some suggestive observations on the development of concept-handling in children. Piaget (Ref. 2), to cite just one example, observes that a very young, child "believes that he 'thinks with his mouth' and that the words he utters actually form part of the objects to which he refers." The analogous possibility in our artefact is obvious. This kind of evidence, coupled with the fact that the artefact, like a child, learns as much by discrimination and negation (dissolution of connections, or diminution of transition-probabilities) as by the complementary process, is, perhaps, valid ground for speculation on actual cerebral analogues; but I must insist again that we are not here interested in speculation but in factual deduction. I believe it to be a fact that an artefact can perform these functions. It is only an encouraging bonus for our efforts that we seem to be developing an artefact that cannot only function to some extent like the brain, but can also develop and go wrong in comparable ways. This is scarcely fortuitous, but is here logically irrelevant. 3.3. Behaviour. A brief remark on problems of behaviour raised by the other speakers may preface discussions of the more important topic of imagination. Mr. Wisdom's distinction between wrinkling the forehead and frowning now presents no difficulty, and indeed finds further elucidation, for there are not two but three possibilities to consider. ," Symbol" here means simply the physical representation of the corresponding concept, essential for its entry into the artefact's "train of thought ". Whether perceiving is a " symbolic activity " in any other sense does not now concern us.</page><page sequence="76">76 D. M. MACKAY. (a) We can have wrinkling of forehead that does not look like or represent a frown. (b) We can have wrinkling indistinguishable in appearance from that in genuine frowning but without the concomitant emotion. (c) We can have wrinkling expressive of that emotion, and deserving to be called frowning. Now our artefact can certainly in principle rise to (a) and (b). But what could we mean by describing its wrinkling as expressive and calling it frowning ? Is it not simply that such wrinkling must be representational activity, the spontaneous outcome or concomitant of internal symbolic activity which is itself not qualitatively different ? If the internal process going on (e.g.) in anger requires for its representation the employ- ment of elements having strong coupling to (high probability of exciting) wrinkling-muscles, then the resultant wrinkling is, I think, indistinguishable from frowning by any test Mr. Wisdom has proposed or even implied. I cannot, however, introduce here the whole question of emotional expression, and will content myself with the undogmatic assertion that I have not so far been shown or thought of any case that cannot find an analogue in a concept-handling artefact which uses any or all of its internal acts of response-including (e.g.) the equivalents of visceral responses in the human being-as potential component-symbols for its representational activity. I think that anyone with one eye on the mechanisms which the human body uses to mediate emotional experience can scarcely fail to have the broad principles of its expression in such an artefact suggested to him. It is perhaps unnecessary now to point out that Mr. Wisdom's other problem of " producing new types of behaviour " in our artefact is the reverse of the actual one, which is to restrain its propensity for spontaneously pro- ducing new types of behaviour. Among its modes of activity (M.B.A., p. 116) is " the alteration of the mechanism controlling response ". Our care in design would need to be exercized chiefly to preserve those minimal con- sistencies that can define a rational personality.</page><page sequence="77">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 77 4. Imagination. 4.1. Image-generation. Let us now see how far-as a matter of demonstrable fact-our statistical artefact can go towards functioning imaginatively. Its normal perceptual activity, it will be remembered, consists in self-moulding matching-responses by groups of elements in a restless population to whatever features in its recepta " catch their attention ". With time and experience, it builds up a repertoire of complex matching-responses that have found application long or often enough to acquire relatively high probabilities of evocation as complete patterns. These patterns, or portions of them, could therefore under suitable conditions be evoked in the absence of the corresponding input-either as an occasional spontaneous outcome of the restlessness of the constituent population, or in response to internal stimuli. Such image-generation-the appearance of representational activity in the absence of corresponding input--can, of course, affect the internal and external behaviour of the artefact, as if it were imagining the corresponding percept in one of several senses. These can hardly be discussed exhaustively, but we can make a start by distinguishing between illusion, hallucination and normal imagination, and considering the analogous distinctions in our artefact. (a) In illusion a real input evokes a false percept (e.g., optical illusions). (b) In hallucination a synthetic percept appears to have qualities of reality (e.g., " hearing voices "). (c) In normal imagination qualities of reality are absent, and images are evoked by conscious effort or consent. Direct analogues of all three can be found in the artefact. (a) " Illusion " arises when the resolving-power of the estimator of mismatch (or the data) is insufficient to cause rejection of the wrong matching-response, or, of course, if some systematic error in the estimator induces a false matching-response. It is easy to see, for example, how the artefact could be deceived by optical illusions. F</page><page sequence="78">78 D. M. MACKAY. (b) "Hallucination" would arise if the spontaneous evocation of a matching-response, without corresponding input, were not accompanied and checked by a resulting signal of mismatch. This could be caused by interruption of the valuational feedback path or masking of the signal by " noise "-two factors with interesting differences in resulting pathology which we cannot now pursue. (c) " Normal imagination" is our main subject and requires more detailed study. Let us first notice that the phenomenon so clearly brought out by Mr. Spilsbury, of " competition " between observation and imagination, finds an immediate and necessary analogue. " Observa- tion " here ousts " imagination ", not indeed because they compete for common pathways, but because imagination is in the artefact represented by internal excitation of the matching-response mechanism, and this is already excited if it is engaged in observing the same thing. Imagination is not blocked; it simply finds nothing more to do9. My predecessors consider that special difficulty arises over imaginative place-changing. Mr. Spilsbury regards as absurd the question whether any conceivable artefact could imagine itself in the position of another, and thinks that only the gift of prophecy could enable his judgment to be tested. I venture to differ from him without the gift of prophecy, and I have therefore no wish to defend the suggestion (that imitation might be a substitute for imagina- tive place-changing) which Mr. Spilsbury has lucidly criticised. Mr. Wisdom is in difficulties for a different reason, for he appears to think that an act of imagination implies the existence of some " object " which stands to the perceiver in a similar relation to that between a real object seen and the seer. Hence his efforts to envisage physical methods of duplication when the " self" is imagined in another place. I hope to show that the analogue of imaginative place-changing in our artefact requires no such technical complexities, and, in fact, is not qualitatively different from any other imaginative activity. 9 To avoid misunderstanding, may I repeat that this also is not a speculation on the mechanism of the human brain, but a deduction of possibilities inherent in the activity of an artefact designed to have a " restless urge to make symbols ". Neurological speculation has its proper place, elsewhere.</page><page sequence="79">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 79 4.2. The significance of concepts to an artefact. It will help if we first consider, all too briefly, the semantic problem as our artefact deals with it. We have seen that it represents a given concept internally by the invariant response-pattern wherewith it matches the received data exemplifying the concept. " Triangularity " in a visual pattern is represented by the sequence of control- signals whereby the response-mechanism is induced to match the definitive features of a triangle. " Triangle " means " something to which I respond like this . . . (a particular response-pattern) ". " Imagine a triangle " means " set up the (appropriate) response-pattern ". Now it is important to recognize that this response-pattern may in general include the setting of thresholds as well as the generation or modification of activity. The meaning of a concept, so defined, includes its associations. " Triangle " comes to mean not only " that which requires activity X to match it " but also " that which has probabilities pi, P2 . . . of requiring activities X1, X2, . . . to accompany or follow X ". (e.g., If X has in the past been accompanied or followed by X1, X2 . . . with frequencies pl, P2 . .?) Higher-order " transition-probabilities " (as these are called) may also be specified; so that, in general, we regard the meaning of a concept as defined by the total " matrix of transition-probabilities " that describes in effect the state of readiness of the artefact for all situations in which the presence of the particular concept is relevant. This state of readiness will generally be representative of the relative success (in minimizing disequilibrium or mismatch) of the different past responses to experiences exemplifying the concept. In other words, valuational feedback on each past occasion has contributed some adjustment to the transition-probability-matrix which now governs (statis- tically) the operational significance of the concept to the artefact. This may sound highly technical, but the basic notion is simple. Let us survey the argument: Our artefact is designed so that it will automatically tend to minimize some parameter of (mean) disequilibrium or mismatch</page><page sequence="80">80 D. M. MACKAY. between its input and its total response. Among its modes of response is that of internal symbolic representation, by internal activity, of" that which is the case " in its field of activity. As component-symbols of its total representations it comes to use selections among certain standard response- patterns, that have acquired special statistical status through frequent success as matching-response-components in the past. These standard patterns represent the concepts of its field of discourse-the basic internal symbols which in appropriate patterns and sequences constitute its. internal descriptions10 of " that which is the case ". In the course of its activity (which can include dialogue), however, it will gradually discover also statistical linkages between concepts, if the abstractive process described in M.B.A. (p. 116) goes on, whereby the artefact perceives patterns in (abstracts regularities from) its own perceptual activity as evoked by the flux of recepta. Valuational feedback can then be introduced to control also the probabilities of transition from one response- pattern to others. This will mean that in the course of time each response-pattern (representing a concept) will tend to be accompanied by an adjustment of thresholds (probabilities of transition) in favour of whatever activities have in the past been most often evoked next, and so on, with no fundamental limit to complexity. This highly- complex configuration of thresholds, conceivably practicable only in a self-organising population such as we envisage, defines what we have called the artefact's state of readiness, a necessary constituent of its representation of the corresponding concept. It is worth noting that this whole process of formation of concepts and their associations can in principle take place from scratch with a statistical tabula rasa, though, of course, it can be greatly accelerated by even small determining factors in design and by normal educative processes such as are used with children. 0o To itself primarily, though, of course, we take for granted the easy step of linking these to communicative activity such as speech.</page><page sequence="81">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 81 4.3. Place-changing. We are now in a position to visualize the process of imagination in the artefact in more detail. " Imagine X " means " evoke the internal representation of X ". This symbol, as we have seen, includes a threshold-configuration rendering highly-probable a transition to some state fre- quently associated with X in the past. Hence imagining X is normally the starting-point of a train of representational activity, previously evoked in association with X, or for some other reason rendered highly probable. Thus one of the best ways the artefact has of trying to imagine a concept, Y, say, is to evoke imagination of some " X " with which it is strongly associated. Normally, of course, the word used to define a concept is adequate as a stimulus to such a train of activity. More generally, " an effort to imagine Y " amounts to setting as many thresholds as possible (preparing a state of readiness) so as to maximize the probability of excitation of representational activity corresponding to Y. The artefact does all that it can, as it were, and then awaits the spontaneous outcome. (It can. of course, have means of increasing the overall frequency of spontaneous transitions, as well as of guiding their directions.) Imagining some familiar scene therefore requires only re-evocation in the artefact of internal matching-responses previously characteristic of its experience there, and linked among themselves by high probabilities of transition. The word "imagine " implies the temporary diversion of the disequilibrium signal which would normally force the perceptual activity to match the current input. It does now, however, imply the absence of all evidence of mismatch. Evidence of the unreality of the experience imagined is still provided by the presence of the diverted signal. It will be apparent by now that the condition that our artefact should imagine itself at a familiar place P is simply that its representations of the familiar percepts of P should include those characteristic of its own presence, including states of readiness to react as if present. Imagining an unfamiliar scene differs only in that the F2</page><page sequence="82">82 D. M. MACKAY. components of the representation must be evoked in response to description, or else taken from past experiences believed typical. I have never seen the Square in Vladivostock, but when I try to imagine myself in it I find myself con- structing a pastiche out of elements of my experience of Squares. Any such activity could find a precise parallel in our artefact. Imaginative time-changing raises, I think, no different problems from imaginative place-changing. There is, of course, another sense in which I could imagine myself in a place P (whether familiar or otherwise), namely, as one of the features of the imagined scene. This is less important, for in this case " I" am represented by an imagined object on the same footing as all others in the image. No new difficulty is introduced in imagining a scene in which " the fourth black dot from the left " is myself instead of someone else. 4.4. Place-exchanging. We come lastly to Mr. Spilsbury's test case. How could our artefact A imagine itself not only in another place, but in the place of another person or artefact B ? Let us first decide what we shall accept as evidence of success in such imagining. Were I, for example, to try to imagine myself in Mr. Spilsbury's place, I should begin by lecturing myself on the absurdity of predicating " mentality " of artefacts. I should go on to try, in all respects on which I have evidence, to " think myself into his state of mind " by assuming a disposition as close as possible to what I infer to be his own. If I knew his life story I should endeavour to relive as much as I could in imagination, retaining whatever attitudinal "set" my imaginings had induced-and so forth. What am I doing ? Clearly I am not concerned with imitation of what Mr. Spilsbury is doing now. What I am trying to set up in myself is a complex state of readiness sufficiently similar to his to enable me to experience (I hope) similar reactions to his own in given situations. I judge my success in imagining myself in his place according as I am able to feel within myself the rise and fall of the same</page><page sequence="83">MENTALITY iN MACHINES. 83 emotions and other inner experiences of which he gives evidence as he meets the same course of events. Normally, of course, we do not meet the same events, so that if I am watching him and trying to imagine myself in his place I have also to imagine (in the way we have discussed) myself as experiencing these events, in an artificial state of readiness bearing the maximum of resemblance to his. The reader can doubtless now anticipate the way in which our artefact A would meet this test. In an analogous manner, it can first evoke internal representational activity to develop within itself a configuration of thresholds judged likely to represent the " attitudinal set " (or total state of readiness or transition-probability-matrix) of B with respect to relevant inputs. (This assumes some degree of similarity of con- ceptual frameworks in A and B, as Mr. Spilsbury has noted in the case of human place-changing.) In this state of readiness it imagines itself in the circum- stances of B by evoking representational activity correspond- ing to what it sees or considers B to be receiving. By virtue of A's " state of readiness ", this results in the evocation of a train of internal responses, normally " uncoupled " from overt action, representing what A imagines to be B's sensations in those circumstances. One could of course elaborate in endless detail, but I can think of no example of human imagination that cannot be paralleled in principle along these lines. To imagine oneself in the place of someone now dead, or in a place not visible, for example, requires only a combination of the processes already discussed. Whether in imaginative place- changing or time-changing, no question of duplication arises, because when I imagine myself elsewhere-or when the artefact does-I and it remain just where we are, and only induce internal activity in ourselves as if we were else- where. To look for physical duplication here would be like looking for moss on the stones of Mr. Spilsbury's paper bridge. 4.5. Imagination and Epiphenomenalism. Here I enter, backwards as it were, the domain of speculation for a brief moment. Epiphenomenalism,</page><page sequence="84">84 D. M. MACKAY. according to Mr. Wisdom, would claim that " imagination is not a dynamical factor in determining behaviour ". An outsider at this point is rather at a loss, and is tempted (with certain contemporary philosophers) to cry " a plague on both your houses ". Certain it is that imagination in our artefact is a vital factor in determining behaviour. The reality of the difference between interactionists and epi- phenomenalists would be clearer if they could agree on the kind of evidence that either side would accept. If any conceivable evidence were consistent with description in either language, one would be driven to see the root of the head-on collision in a false presupposition unquestioned by either side and shown by their choice of language. Such situations have met us even in physics, and their outcome has uniformly been a deeper if initially painful comprehension of the truths inhering in both sides. 4.6. Choice and voluntary behaviour. The problems of choice and voluntary behaviour must for lack of space be discussed elsewhere. Here I will merely observe that no " prior process of mental coin- tossing " determines voluntary behaviour in our artefact, and agree with Mr. Spilsbury that " there is a difference between an original thinker and a perfect randomiser,"- which surely need hardly be emphasized. As an indication of a more constructive answer in terms of our artefact I would say that the difference shows itself in the structure of the transition-probability-matrix ; but the significance of " randomness " (noted in M.B.A.) as the only scientifically attributable " source " of originality in the artefact's activity remains as a central philosophical question. Here I think at last we are really out in the cold of our own ignorance. The whole idea of randomness cries aloud for a more positive analysis in the context of spon- taneous and meaningful and purposeful activity. 5. Perspective. In a discussion so beset with the difficulties of language and interpretation, perhaps I may be allowed in summarizing to make clear my personal view of the deeper issues that often underlie arguments brought forward in this field.</page><page sequence="85">MENTALITY IN MACHINES. 85 5.1. There is a sense in which I consider all the fore- going detailed demonstrations to be trivial. As I see it, any test (for mental or any other attributes) to be satisfied by the observable activity of an artefact or a human being must take the form of the specification of a stochastic process :-a series of statements defining (a) any activities which must be shown in certain precisely defined circumstances, together with (b) the statistical criteria by which any less-rigidly specified activity shall be judged to have failed the test. All the tests suggested in this symposium satisfy this description, and it is difficult to see what could be meant by a test which did not. A typical test is of the form " In circumstances X, unless the following description can be applied to the activity of A, it has failed the test." (a) In simple cases the activity is uniquely defined, and the test asserts that a transition- probability of I must hold between X and the specified response in A. (b) In more complex cases we allow (or even demand) a range of possible responses, but" by definition we have inadequate information to specify exactly which should occur. In general the most we can do is to specify precisely the statistical criteria by which any response-or any sequence or pattern of responses however long-shall be judged inconsistent with the characteristic for which we are testing. Correlations and regular features of behaviour may be defined by specifying transition-probabilities of any order, with I as the limit which reduces our specification to type (a). 5. 2. Now the confidence with which one is entitled to face any challenge as to the potentialities of artefacts rests on a general thesis which I think I have merely been illustrating in the foregoing demonstrations-namely, that physical processes and mechanisms now known enable us in principle to mechanize a stochastic process of any complexity specifiable in the definition of a finite test.12 Verification of this thesis 11 Neglecting the trivial case where the appropriateness of each of these depends on the presence of some subspecified feature of X, which would reduce it to case (a). 12 Threshold-control suffices to determine transition-probabilities of any order, if appropriate (and well-known) logical networks are used to generate the control-signals.</page><page sequence="86">86 D. M. MACKAY. in response to suggestions of particular tests seems thus, as I have said, to be at least logically trivial. It is not valueless, however, if it clears away barriers to consideration of the basic problem to which I have referred-the philo- sophical status of " randomness," viewed as the factor which is only transformed and canalized by the systematic part of the specification to become the origin of all novelty in the conceptual process described. Let us equally explicitly recognize, however, that this kind of demonstration cannot prove such an artefact to possess mentality in the full human sense. It shows only that as far as we can find words for tests we can expect these to be met. It would show more appropriate humility to leave open the question whether now or at any time, or even in principle, we shall be able to exhaust or even to become aware of all features of our experience from which we abstract the concept of mind. The situation has a parallel in theological history, where those who saw God only through what loop-holes were left by our ignorance of physics (a " God of the gaps ") were I think equally at fault in their underlying assumptions with those who smothered the gaps with faith in Science (with a capital S) and declared God non-existent. We shall not " save " the concept of Mind by hunting restlessly for " something that you won't be able to explain in terms of mechanism "-for a false assumption is implicit in the use of the word " explain." As in the parallel case of " science and religion," the activity is not one of exhaustive explanation, but of comple- mentary description. Each description one should expect to be exhaustive in terms of its own categories ; but to apprehend the whole requires a discipline in the perception of complementarity which we have scarcely begun to acquire.
