<plain_text><page sequence="1">OCEANIA Vol. 81 No. 3 November 2011 The Sun and the Shakers, Again: Enga, Ipili, and Somaip Perspectives on the Cult of Ain Part Two Aletta Biersack University of Oregon ABSTRACT The 'Sun and the Shakers, Again' resumes the conversation begun by Mervyn J. Meggitt in his 1973 article 'The Sun and the Shakers' concerning the circumstances and mindset of Enga and Ipili speakers on the eve (or in the early stages) of colonial penetration. The 'Cult of Ain,' as Meggitt termed a regional cult that broke out in the mid-1940s, followed on the heels of devastating epidemics and famine and was in some measure, at least in most areas where it caught on, a response to those traumas. Yet there were other dimensions: apparent cargo cultism and millenarianism. Widening the geographical scope of reporting beyond that of Meggitt's article to include both the Somaip, as reported on by Hans Reithofer in The Python Spirit and the Cross, and the Ipili speakers of the western Porgerà valley and the Paiela valley, this second and final installment reviews and critiques existing interpretations of the Cult of Ain in light of the ethnohistorical detail offered in the first installment and goes on to offer an interpretation of the cult that is inspired by the cosmological symbols common to all cult versions: most obviously the sun but also the sky. The Cult of Ain is viewed by participants and their descendants alike as the prelude to colonialism and missionization, and understanding it is crucial to writing the cultural history of the last 65+ years. Keywords: New Guinea, western highlands, cultural history, cosmology, first contact INTERPRETING THE CULT OF AIN Meggitt's explanation for the cult remains foundational and indispensable to all subsequent writings on it. 'the frequency with which the epidemics of the early 1940s entered the Enga region, as well as the rate and extent of their spread ... left the people feeling vulnerable' and doubting the efficacy of their rituals (1974a:20; see also Feil 1983:95-96; Frankel 1986:26-28; Oceania 81,2011 225</page><page sequence="2">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two Gibbs 1977:11; Glasse 1995:72-73; Jacka 2002:202-03; Sharp 1990:112-13; Wiessner and Tumu 1998:383,2001:310). The growing awareness of the presence of whites was a further destabilizer (Meggitt 1974a: 19). A third factor, not well developed by Meggitt but pursued with greater or lesser commitment by other scholars, was that indigenous culture in some way laid the groundwork for this cult. Scholars disagree on the relative importance of these several factors and on the overarching logic that made this cult so compelling to its ethnically varied participants. Gibbs accepts Meggitt's account of the proximate causes of the cult but calls upon his knowledge of indigenous belief in both the Porgerà and Paiela valleys to account for the millenarian turn Meggitt saw the cult as taking among Ipili speakers. The notion of a 'bodily assumption up into the sky' (1977:14) may have been new to the cult but it was not new to Ipili speakers, who believed that 'sky people and mythical heroes' shifted from the earth to the sky in Ipili mythology (ibid.). In fact, Europeans were mistaken for sky people who had returned to the earth (ibid.: 15), possibly leading to speculations about an imminent ascent to the sky (ibid.). Gibbs also notes that Ipili speakers believed 'the world was about to end' (ibid.) because a key world preserver named Isini had informed Langate that he would soon 'cease maintaining order' (ibid.). 'It followed that offerings might be made to the sun' to avert this catastrophe (ibid.). Gibbs also observes that certain cult practices were continuous with the indigenous bachelor growth ritual called omatisia, the Ipili equivalent of the Enga sangai (ibid.: 15-17) alluded to in other accounts. Gibbs concludes that, to Ipili participants, the cult 'did not seem strange, and various parts of the cult were easily fitted into their traditional mythology' (ibid.:20). The most sweeping argument for continuity between traditional rituals and beliefs, on the one hand, and the Cult of Ain, on the other, is made by Wiessner and Tumu in their book Historical Vines. They agree with Meggitt about the proximate causes of the cult. The epidemics, 'a spiral of rampant and destructive warfare' (1998:383), and 'rumors of European intrusion' (ibid.) made people fear that 'the end of the world was imminent' (ibid.). In this context there was fear of a great fire, and the cult was initiated 'to stave off this fiery disaster through ritual intervention' (ibid.). This scenario—fear of world's end and ritual intervention to save it—is familiar to a cluster of peoples who participated in a regional ritual system. Hulis called this system dindi gamu or 'earth magic,' Engas named it Tondaka (a.k.a. Tuandaga) after the key site and meaning blood (1998:442, n. 18), Ipili speakers called it Tuandaka (Biersack 1998a:48-50; Jacka 2003:156-67), and Reithofer refers to the Somaip equivalent as Tunda Kepele (2006:123)/ Dindi gamu premised that the earth had a tendency to decline, necessitating a ritual intervention that restored the vitality of both the earth and human society whenever the end of the earth seemed near (Wiessner and Tumu 1998:186-92,2001:307-10; see also Allen and Frankel 1991:96-97; Ballard 1994:141-44, 1995:139-46, 1998:76-79, 2000:212-18; Biersack 1995a:21,1999:73-74; Frankel 1986:19-23; Glasse 1963, 1965:45-46,1995:69-72; Goldman 1983:113-14, 119-20; Jacka 2003:156-72; Reithofer 2006:168-74),3 This ritual intervention was performed at a string of sites ordered along an underground 'root of the earth.' The root was associated with a python and served to link the sites and to conduct oil and/or smoke from one site to another. According to Frankel and Allen (Allen and Frankel 1991:96-97; Frankel 1986:19-23), ritual activity was initiated in the Papuan Plateau at a place called Malaya (a.k.a. Malaiya), southwest of Tari, then moved into the Highlands at several Huli locations, continued onto Tunda (a.k.a. Tuandaga, Tuandaka) among Karinj speakers (Reithofer 2006:123,168-79), and culminated, according to Frankel (1986:23), at Bibipaite in Enga territory. Ballard proposes an even more inclusive geography. Ritual performances were coordinated among perhaps five ... sites in Huli territory, and the cooperative involvement of at least five other ritual centers in the neighboring territories of the Duna, the Bedamini, the Onabasulu [the Bedamini and Onabasulu 226</page><page sequence="3">Biersack lie southwest of Tari], the Wage [a.k.a. Waka] Enga, and the Ipili-Paiela was considered by the Huli leaders to be necessary for the success of these rituals (2000:212; see also Ballard 1994:143, figure 5; 1995:139-46; see map).5 While there remains some disagreement on the scope of this 'sacred geography' (see, for example, Wiessner and Tumu 1998:188-89, map 12), Wiessner and Tumu's point is that ethnic groups that participated in this regional ritual system also participated in Ain's Cult (Wiessner and Tumu 2001:310,316), suggesting that the premise and project of Ain's Cult was the dindi gamu premise and project: the earth tended to decline and required a ritual rescue in moments of enervation. Indeed, Wiessner and Tumu list Lyeimi (Yeim in their spelling) as the northernmost site of the dindi gamu system (1998:188, map 12). Ain and his sons in fact 'came from a long line of ritual experts in the branch of the Dindi Gamu held at Yeim' (Wiessner and Tumu 1998:383), and Ain himself 'had been a central ritual expert in the Yeim branch of the Dindi Gamu' (Wiessner and Tumu 2001:310). A key dindi gamu strategy was to produce a recurrence of a 'time of darkness' or mbingi and the ashfall associated with it (Frankel 1986:18). Once mbingi was over, '[t]here followed [an unprecedented] period of garden abundance and proliferation of pigs ... and a time of peace and prosperity ... throughout the land' (Allen and Frankel 1991:96). Wiessner and Tumu point out that a 'major focus' of the versions of Ain's Cult occurring among those ethnicities that had participated in dindi gamu— Engas and Ipilis are specifically mentioned—was indeed 'a recurrence of the time of darkness' (2001:316), suggesting that the basic project of the Cult of Ain was the dindi gamu project of revitalizing the earth. 'Large houses were constructed to accommodate communities during the predicted ash fall and keep them safe until cult leaders called on the sun to disperse the darkness' (ibid.). There is surprisingly little in print on mara gamu, the Huli version or versions of the Cult of Ain, and what little there is has been summarized previously. Yet several Huli scholars have identified the Huli mood and situation in the 1930s and early 1940s in ways that suggest Hulis would have embraced the cult for the promise it appeared to hold (at least for Hulis proselytized by Waka Engas [Frankel 1986:29]) of remedying an earthly decline. Ballard writes, for example, that conditions were unusually discouraging around 1942. 'An unprecedented spate of wars, droughts, and famines, exacerbated by a rapidly expanding population, had led to a series of attempts by the major ritual leaders to coordinate the earth rituals [dindi gamu] and provoke a beneficent apocalypse' (2000:215). But confidence in the efficacy of existing ritual, especially in regard to inducing a further ashfall, a key component of dindi gamu performances (Frankel 1986:18), abated. As one leader explained, 'Before, mbingi came often. Now there is little mbingi left...' (Ballard 2000:215). On the eve of the Cult of Ain, then, the Huli experienced a 'growing uncertainty over the fundamental postulates of Huli cosmology' (ibid.), which might explain Hulis' openness to mara gamu proselytizers. Allen and Wood add to this the fact that attempts had been made 'to precipitate another bingi because of a generally acknowledged decline in garden yields, in the growth of pigs, and the size and strength of men since the last bingi. The decline became apparent about the 1930s when European contacts were made in the Tari Basin and may be an unconscious recognition by the Huli that their material culture is inferior to that of the newcomer ... ' (1980:342). Among Cult of Ain reporters, Reithofer alone does not embrace Meggitt's emphasis upon recent famines, droughts, cold spells, and epidemics because his informants 'denied that preceding famines and/or epidemics prompted their participation' (2006:193). But he agrees with Wiessner and Tumu that prior participation in the regional ritual system designed to arrest earth's decline 'facilitated the acceptance of the cult' (ibid.: 193). One of the key sites in the regional ritual system was Tunda, a Somaip site (called Tondaka by Engas and Tuandaka by Ipili speakers), and the fact that the cult was initiated in Lyeimi, where dindi gamu or dindi gamu-like rituals had been performed, predisposed Somaips to the cult's teachings (ibid.: 194). Yet Reithofer's main emphasis is upon local conceptualizations of the sky and how they came 227</page><page sequence="4">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two WOLA MENDI This map was compiled on the basis of Ballard 1994: 143, figure 5; Feil 1983: 91 ; Gibbs 1978: 3, map 1; Jacka 2002: 197, figure 1, and 200, figure 2; Meggitt 1974: 3; Reithofer 2006: 8, map 1.1, 22, map 1.2; Wiessner and Tumu 1998: 14, map 2; and Wiessner and Tumu 2001: 304, map 2. into play in Ip Tand, the Somaip version of the Cult of Ain. Through a subtle reading of the nuances of the symbolism of Ip Tand, Reithofer concludes that the promise of an ascent to a utopie sky was implicit in that symbolism and was, at least eventually, itself an important motivation for cult participation. 'The Ip Tand prophets had raised hopes not simply of an improvement of earthly life, but of a total transformation, which the Somaip depicted in the image of the celestial world, where the sky people lived in abundant wealth and without the constraints of ageing, sickness or death' (ibid.:207). Meggitt believed that the presence of white men in the area and a growing awareness of the nature of white wealth/manufactured items among Engas partially explained the appeal of the cult (1974a: 19-20). To account for Tumundan expectations that a new and larger kind of pig and pearlshell would soon be available (ibid.:25), he introduced the figure of Aipa, who had a precocious familiarity with whites and who inflected the cult in cargo cult-like ways (ibid.:24-25; see also Wiessner and Tumu 2001:315). Just how important awareness of white material culture was in motivating participation in the Cult of Ain depended upon the specific historical experience of particular ethnicities, and this, in turn, depended upon their proximity to 'contact zones' (Pratt 1992). The closer to Wabag, the peephole on white lifestyle, the greater the interest in white manufactured goods; the further from Wabag, the greater the ignorance of such goods. The Somaip had only a limited knowledge of white people (Reithofer 2006:193), for example, and, although wealth acquisition was an important motivation for cult participation, it was the traditional treasure of pigs and pearlshells, not white wealth, that Somaip strove to acquire (ibid.: 195). Tumundan, on the other hand, was closer to Wabag and there were figures such as Aipa who had seen and come to covet white treasure of various sorts. 228</page><page sequence="5">Biersack The desire to acquire white wealth was clearly present in the Porgerà valley, and the scholar who has emphasized the white presence and a desire for white manufactured goods the most is Jerry Jacka, whose dissertation research (2003) was conducted at Tipinini at the eastern edge of the Porgerà valley. Although Jacka does not consider the Cult of Ain a cargo cult ('the cults as practiced by the Enga and Ipili were concerned with much more than material wealth' [2002:196]), he nonetheless implies that wealth acquisition was the primary motive. Jacka writes about an Aipa-like figure, Wambe Yawin, an Enga who had seen Jim Taylor and his patrol as they approached Mulitaka (see map) around September 1,1938 (ibid.:202). 'They had bushknives, saucepans and axes' (ibid.). This was the beginning of Wambe's association with Taylor, which would see him traveling with Taylor 'throughout the highlands and coastal areas' (ibid.). As the Cult of Ain was getting under way, Wambe went to Lyeimi, where he joined up with the cult leaders and 'took the pig killing cult on the road to spread to many people' (ibid.:204). Wambe was present at Wailya when Jim Taylor and his party 'killed some men and pigs there' (ibid.:202; see also ibid.:204), and he appears to have been present at Tumundan (ibid.:204) and Tipinini (ibid.:205) as well. Given his knowledge of and fascination with white material culture, Wambe could have inflected the cult in cargo cult-like ways. Jacka believes that the Enga proselytizers approached Tipinini and Tumundan through Wailya, and this makes Kaiyamba, who lived in Wailya at the time of the cult, germane to both Tumundan and Tipinini versions of the cult. Like Wambe, Kaiyamba had a familiarity with white men, but it was a familiarity that had bred contempt. He had heard about Jim Taylor, whose patrol, like the Fox Brothers patrol (Ballard 2003:122; Golub 2001:135-37), sometimes took the lives of indigenes (ibid.: 146-47; Meggitt 1956:92). Alarmed he not only warned people at Wailya about the advancing white man but started his own cult to protect local people from the white man about six years before the onset of the Cult of Ain. 'Kaiyamba's Cult,' as Jacka calls it, was a kind of prequel to Ain's Cult. Kaiyamba built a big house into which he drew people and taught them wealth magic. Everyone in the house was dressed in finery, but they were told to abandon the clothing and decorations on the road. Jacka singles out this detail, and also the fact that wealth magic was taught, as evidence of the true purpose of Kaiyamba's Cult. 'People dressing in their finest wealth items and then giving them up supports the idea that the cult was concerned with the acquisition of wealth, especially new kinds of wealth' (2002:201). Kaiyamba also told his followers that 'the sun had given birth to him' (ibid.:200) and that people should prepare to go to the sky (tai toko) (ibid.:201). Jacka believes that this focus upon the sky was secondary to the motif of wealth acquisition. According to Jacka, 'sky women' were viewed as having 'wealth bestowing properties' in both Enga and Ipili myths (ibid.: 199), and the sky was viewed as a desirable destination because of it. Also, white men were classified as sky men. 'Their skins were light like the sky people, and their substantial wealth of steel tools and shells further linked them' to the sky as a source of wealth (ibid.). Jacka ultimately accounts for Enga and Ipili participation in the Cult of Ain in terms of the attempt of Engas and Ipilis 'to integrate themselves into the white world of power, exemplified by the guns and the numerous killings of the patrols [through the area], and wealth, expressed in the patrols' seemingly inexhaustible and often miraculous number of material items and trade goods' (ibid.). UNDERSTANDING THE PARTICIPATION OF IPILI SPEAKERS At first glance, the range of variation of mata kamo among Ipili speakers would appear to bear out the argument that the cult was fixated on the acquisition of white wealth—more or less depending upon the particular ethnicity's proximity to contact portals such as Wabag. The further west into Ipili-speaking territory the cult went, the less focused on wealth acquisition, the more focused on a skyward ascent it was. Obversely, the further east into Ipili speaking territory the cult went, the more focused on the new white wealth the cult became. One might then conclude that the motive of acquiring white wealth was important at Tipinini because of 229</page><page sequence="6">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two its proximity to Wabag and lacking in the Paiela valley because of its distance from Wabag. But I shall argue in this section that this conclusion, however compelling it may at first seem, is incomplete and even misleading, because ascending to the sky was the primary motivation in both locations. Here I use my knowledge of pre-Christian Ipili cosmology to interpret the sky symbolism in Porgerà and Paiela versions of the cult and to argue that the wealth acquisition motive, where it appeared, was secondary to the motive of ascending to the sky. Indeed, I shall go even further and suggest that, properly understood, the goals of acquiring wealth and ascending to the sky are not easily distinguished. The Sky in Cosmological Perspective The precontact cosmos of Ipili speakers turned on a sky/earth axis. The earth (yu) was the cosmic zone of organic life and its processes. 'On the ground' plants, animals, and humans came into existence, grew, 'replaced' themselves, and then died. Human life—the dominant terrestrial life form—was governed by what I have called a 'sacrificial principle': that human life was exhausted in its own maintenance or replenishment, that the condition of perpetuating life was death, and that life and death were thus two sides of the same coin (Biersack 1995a:22, 1995b:257-61, 1996:92-95, 1998a:52-55, 1999:75, 2004:111-12, 2005:140-41; see also Biersack 2001:85-89; Buchbinder and Rappaport 1976; Golub 2006:271-72; Reithofer 2006:180-82; Stewart and A. Strathern 2002:281-282; cf. Bloch and Parry, eds., 1982). Although this casts the principle in abstract terms, it pervaded everyday life—most notably in Paiela conceptualizations of peape or 'work.' Peape is a category inclusive of the 'work' of assembling bridewealth and homicide compensation, the 'work' of going to war and avenging the murder of a relative, the 'work' of learning, observing, and performing magic, and the more obvious 'work' of gardening and pig husbandry (cf. Fajans 1997). The more manual the work, the more lethal it was. In the long run, peape was understood to sap the person's strength and rob the worker of his or her vitality. The cost of feeding oneself and others was thus ultimately the very life one hoped to sustain. Human life was exhausted in its own maintenance; death was inevitable (cf. Golub 2006:272). The more exotic exemplification of the sacrificial principle lay in the realm of reproduction. A cardinal rule was that one must bear children to 'take one's place' (panda mia). Anyone who did not shoulder this responsibility was denigrated as immature and insignificant (Biersack 2004:110-11). But a price was to be paid for garnering the respect of others by marrying, for husbands and wives were thought to age, even die, through a range of fertility-related activities—from menstruation to coitus to childbearing to nursing—the implication being that the cost of reproducing life was life itself. The upshot of procreation (the most important kind of 'work' Ipili speakers did) was death. The key facts of life were only partially about 'the birds and the bees,' then. At base they concerned the inextricability of life and death. The principle of a life-for-a-life was honored most dramatically in traditional sacrificial practices such as kolo, in which a pig's life was exchanged for a human life, and most violently in the eye-for-an-eye calculus of revenge murders. By this logic, death necessitated reproduction (one must replace oneself because one is mortal) but reproduction (the remedy for death) promoted death. Earth was the cosmic zone where this catch-22 held sway. It was where fathers and mothers died in the cause of bearing children, on and on. Earth itself, for all its obvious spatiality, was temporal and mortal, like all the life forms it hosted. It 'originated' (ungi la), was 'new' (wene) or 'young' (kolongi) then 'ended' (ko ya), but only to begin again over 14 generations-worth of regeneration (Biersack 1991:290-91, n. 15; 1995a:20-23; 1996:95-97; 1999:75-76; 2001:40; 2005:139)." Like all life forms, earth had a 'skin' (umbuaini)—its surface (the 'outer earth'), where the living lived—and a 'bone' (kulini) or 'inner earth' —where the dead resided. Whenever a series of calamities occurred and/or the luck of particular lines turned, the earth's vitality and fertility were judged to be on the wane, and Ipili speakers performed a 230</page><page sequence="7">Biersack variety of rituals to revitalize the earth. At least one, possibly as many as four, points within the Ipili-speaking area participated in the regional ritual system that was designed to arrest a decrepit earth (Ballard 1994:143, figure 5,1995:144; Biersack 1998a:48-50,1999:73; Jacka 2003:158, figure 21; Wiessner and Tumu 1998:188-89, map 12). But Ipili speakers also performed pig sacrifices at ponds where the ancestors of particular lineages were thought to reside to reinvigorate the earth. Like dindi gamu rituals, these remedial rituals were not millenarian. They sought to rejuvenate, not perfect, the earth—to return the earth to the beginning of its cycle, not to detemporalize it. The 'ground' or 'earth' (yu) contrasted in every dimension with the ethereal, immaterial sky (tawe or tawe toko). Whereas the inhabitants of the earth were spatiotemporal beings, the inhabitants of the sky lived outside time and space. Relatedly, earth beings were mortal but sky beings were not. At the end of some tindi or myths, 'sky men and women' (tawe wanda akali) ascended to the sky, where they became immortal and were thought to cause thunder and lightning (Gibbs 1975:79,1977:9,14). Far and away the most important being associated with the sky was the sun (,nai and aluni or, as Gibbs reports [ibid.:80], nii or ni, nitawe, ewa, and onewa), imagined as a male. To understand the sun, it is necessary to see him as the source or 'maker' of light (wa piyane ko). In that capacity, the sun was the creator of sighted subjects. The verb anda means to know as well as to see, and the sun was a seer and a knower, as were those whom he caused to see and know in making light. The visible, daytime/daylight world was not only the sun's creation but the link of intersubjectivity, the channel of communication, between him and the sighted, knowing creatures he made in making light. As I was told in my 1970s interviews, 'When the sun looks down and we look up, we exchange glances [anda lawa law a pi] and exchange thoughts [nembo lawa lawa pi]' or communicate; and, 'When we see what the sun sees, we take his mind' [nembo mialamane]. As the maker of knowing human beings, the sun was the source of all mana, a word Ingemann glosses as 'law; teaching, custom; fashion; practice' (n.d.:n.p.) and which I gloss as knowledge. For all the connection between humans and the sun, the sun and his sky world were superior to the earth and humanity, its dominant life form. Humans were embodied, the sun was not; humans were mortal, the sun was not; humans were trapped within space and time (the earth), the sun was not. All of these contrasts were brilliantly encapsulated in the notion of the sun as a single eye. As an eye (nai lene or 'sun eye'), the sun was a particular kind of seer and knower: all seeing, omniscient. At night he 'went inside' to the 'house of the spirits of the dead' (talepa anda) (also called 'ground bone' or yu kulini), where he saw and knew the dead in his present. Let's think about what this means. For Ipili speakers, death was (and is) more a phenomenological than a physical state. A dead person is invisible, which is why Ipili speakers locate the dead inside the 'ghost house' (talepa anda) of the inner earth (the 'ground bone'), where they cannot be seen. People who can be seen are ipso facto not dead. That the sun saw the dead meant that for him the dead were alive! That he saw them in his present also meant that for him there was no past. At dawn the sun 'came outside' and saw and knew (again in his present) the living. Viewed experientially, as a subject, the sun had no night, only interminable day (he was the 'maker of light'), and, in seeing the dead as well as the living, he lived in an eternal now. 'The sun sees inside caves, the forest, inside houses, the good and the bad, women and men, he sees thoroughly [anda yeke la], he is entirely strong, he sees everything,' Lapu, a man living in Kolombi when I worked with him in the 1970s, told me. He was 'the ever watchful one' (Gibbs 1975:80). The living, in contrast, saw and knew during the day but not at night, the living but not the dead, and (to extrapolate) here and not there, near and not far, on the surface of the ground but not underneath, and now but not then. These limitations stemmed from the condition of embodiment, which anchored human beings in time and space, imposing upon them a spatiotemporal horizon of seeing and knowing that the sun, in seeing and knowing everything, lacked. Let me suggest that the difference between the monocular seeing/knowing of the sun and the binocular seeing/knowing of human beings lay 231</page><page sequence="8">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two in the contrast between the transcendent limitlessness of solar subjectivity and the immanent limitedness of human subjectivity, confined as embodied human beings were to space and time (B iersack 2004:118-19). More succinctly, it was said that the sun was not born, nor would he die, but that human beings were mortal. In sum: human existence was cursed by the sacrificial principle, but the sun dwelled in a transcendent everywhere and everywhen, beyond the jurisdiction of that principle. The sun, and through him the sky, symbolized a possibility that was foreclosed to humanity: mind without body, subjectivity without flesh, and liberation from the cycle of birth, regeneration, and death that the earth, in its 14-generation cycle, and in its materiality, spatiality, and temporality, signified. Motive in Mata Kamo Why did mata kamo participants want to go to the sky? The answers I received to this question were uniform and to be expected, given the millenarian character of the sky in Ipili cosmological constructions. Pilato, the old man living in Pitika, told me that the purpose of the ritual was to go to the sky iest we die.' Luke echoed this explanation: 'We didn't want to die. If we went to the sky, we'd be with the sun, and we wouldn't die.' Lewambo—like Luke, a person with whom I worked over many field seasons and who spoke with me about mata kamo in 2000—said that he knew about taw e toko from the myths in which sky men ascended to the sky, 'the good ground.' Sky men were immortal, and those who participated in mata kamo wanted to become immortal too. 'My father had already died, and I did not want to die; that's why I killed pigs.' When in the same year I asked a man who had participated in the cult in Konema, west of the Paiela valley, why people wanted to go to the sky, he answered almost exactly as Lewambo had: 'The ground is where my mother and father died; it is where people die. We wanted to go to the sky so that we would become immortal. We were told that if we went to the sky, we would not die.' The payment given to the spellmen was believed to 'buy' the 'new ground' in the sky 'above the clouds.' So, too, the sacrificed pigs: 'With the pigs we bought the ground in heaven [here he used the Christian term, which he learned well after the events of mata kamo].' With the first sighting of a plane or white man, the specter of ground's end was raised in the minds of Ipili speakers. But arresting earth's decline appears not to have been the focus of their several versions of mata kamo. Mata kamo offered new rituals to serve new purposes given new possibilities: not the perpetuation of the earth, with its zero-sum (death-for-life and life-for-death) principle, but liberation from that principle through an ascent to the sky. The other salient aspect of Ipili versions of the cult, the goal of acquiring abundant wealth (traditional and/or white), I argue, was of a piece with the goal of achieving immortality. Organic life must be sustained through 'work,' and work ages the body, in time rendering it ever more useless and moribund. In accounting for why Tipininians entered the pond, despite (one must imagine) their fear of the water (see note 23), Pimbisu put the fantasy succinctly: 'Thinking that in the sky, they would eat while resting [that is, without labor], they went into the water' (Yu epene okona oto no pitimakale nembo talu ipa okona peainipia). No more clearing land, fencing and mounding gardens, and all the other horticultural travails. Nowadays, the Biblical Garden of Eden story depicts for Ipili speakers the same posthorticultural reality (Biersack 1996:105, 2005:148-52): an era of freedom from manual labor, of 'eating while resting.' Let me suggest that, in eliminating production, windfall wealth would have seemed to have abrogated the requirement that human beings labor to sustain themselves, along with the toll of that requirement: aging, decrepitude, and death. The most important domain of the 'work' that Ipili speakers do is the 'work' of sexual reproduction, including accumulating bridewealth (traditionally pigs and pearlshells) and payments to matrikin for children, as well as, of course, intercourse, childbearing, and childrearing. Sexual reproduction is risky, for the exotic reasons already adduced but also, 232</page><page sequence="9">Biersack more prosaically, because women can die in childbirth and because the wear and tear on a woman's body from breastfeeding to cultivating, harvesting, and cooking the tubers that nourish weaned children is obvious to every Ipili-speaking woman and man. Among the liberations the cult appears to have promised was freedom from the penalties of intersexual congress. Males and females bathed and/or ate together not only without fear but even with a modicum of joy. Libidos became unbridled in the apparently new sexual regime of penalty less pleasure. But the true summum bonum was surely a life that had been released from the responsibility of reproduction—that eternal, deathless life the sky might have appeared to offer. In sum, to ascend to the sky was to achieve a superior, workless and deathless life, deathless because it was workless. Nane Pasia, a man who lived in Masiapulika in the southwest corner of the Paiela valley at the time of mata kamo, put it best in our 2000 conversation at Walumane at the southern end of the Paiela valley. 'We sacrificed to the sun and moon because we wanted to live with them. We were exchanging their ground for our ground. The pigs were the payment for the exchange,' he said. Why did you want to do that, I asked? 'Because the ground we have is bad. We work too hard on it, we suffer, we die. In the sun's and moon's ground, life is not harsh; it is not mortal' (emphasis added). Just how would life be improved? I asked. ' We would not work, we would not garden, we would not build houses, we would be happy, we would not die. We wanted to live forever, not die and be buried in a grave' (emphasis added). Whiteness Interpreted Given these ideas, what was the significance of white men and their manufactured goods from the local perspective? On this very important question, I can only speculate, based on the indigenous imaginings of white people over many field seasons, beginning in the 1970s (see Biersack 1996:106-09). White goods were, and still are, viewed as vastly superior to indigenous goods. The gun is superior to the spear, the steel axe to the stone axe, tin roofs to thatched roofs, rice to the sweet potato, on and on. In the time of Ain's Cult, the steel axe had already made its appearance, as had guns, and we know from Meggitt's rich account how deep was the impression made by a cow's tail, understood to be a pig's tail, on western Engas and eastern Ipilis. The steel ax minimized the labor required to clear and fence a garden. Indeed, participants in mata kamo were promised not just wealth but windfalls of wealth, easy wealth and an abundance of it, with the implication, one must imagine, that the human condition— a condition of drudgery, suffering, and death—would be ameliorated if not entirely transformed. The fact of the matter is that white people quickly acquired an aura (pace Leavitt 2000) as presumed sky people. Bill Gammage wrote in The Sky Travellers, a book about Jim Taylor and John Black's famous Hagen-Sepik patrol: 'most commonly the travellers' wealth, planes, wireless, guns and sometimes white or red skin suggested that they were sky people, perhaps refugees from a sky battle, wandering the earth below, landless and womanless, seeking a place to settle' (1998:1). There is indication enough that the category of sky person was the operative one in the Ipili-speaking areas through which the patrol passed. When Jim Taylor arrived in the Paiela valley in September 1938, he took to identifying himself as best he could to the local people by mimicking a plane. 'Ah, people said, you are sky people' (ibid.: 132). Similarly, when John Black entered Kolombi in March 1939, he overheard people calling him 'sky person' (albeit in Engan, not Ipili) (ibid.: 188). Overnighting in Kolombi, Black heard chanting, and when he inquired into this chanting, he was assured that the purpose of the chanting was 'to placate the sky people' (ibid.). This characterization persisted into the 1970s, when I began my research in the Paiela valley. When a Catholic brother hiking in the Paiela valley had a heart attack and died, this 233</page><page sequence="10">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two belief was challenged but not ultimately discredited, for some thought that the brother had died voluntarily, so that he could go to the sky and get whatever wealth was there and bring it back to the Paiela. Whereas black men (akali pombotene) lived under the jurisdication of the sacrificial principle and died necessarily, white men were imagined as dying by choice, with the idea of ascending to the sky and tapping its treasure (see Biersack 1996:108,1999:79-80). The same could and has been said about Engas. I have already quoted Meggitt's statement that 'all aspects of the Europeans and their entourage ... combined to make a deep impression on the Enga, who quickly came to regard the Europeans as visitors from the celestial world or, less commonly, as reincarnations of ancestral spirits from the terrestrial world' (1974a: 16). In a footnote to that statement Meggitt corroborates Gammage's claim that Europeans were classified as sky people: the conviction of central Enga that Europeans were yalyakali, immortal 'causal people' visiting from the sky-world, was not seriously shaken until 1951, when a small aeroplane crashed at Wapenamanda and all of its occupants, including the Assistant District Officer, were killed. As late as 1955 when I began my field work among the Mae Enga, many older men still insisted that Europeans were transient sky-people, whose failure to perform their proper meteorological functions in the world above was responsible for such terrestrial difficulties as the recent poor yields of pandanus nuts (ibid., n. 13; emphasis added). The chapters of Gammage's book on the Taylor-Black patrol in Enga-speaking territory establish beyond all doubt that the characterization of the white man as a sky person was salient (but see note 18 in Part One) as early as 1938. A single example will suffice. At one point, John Black climbed a tall tree to scout the country. Noticing a man some distance away, he called and waved. [Quoting from John Black's diary] 'He waved back but seemed terribly surprised', John wrote, I climbed down ... a few natives... came up ... They seemed nervous ... By signs I found that they thought we had alighted from the clouds on to the nearby tree and climbed down ... Nothing would convince them that this was not so ... One old chap, possibly a sorcerer himself, took a professional interest in us ... he excitedly cleared a patch of grass level with the ground and asked us to give them a demonstration of disappearing into thin air ... (Gammage 1998:55-56). White 'wealth' was more than mere wealth: it was the trappings of a cosmically privileged life style. For all intents and purposes, white people lived in the sky. When I asked Paielas in the 1970s where white people lived, I was told 'near the sun' (see Biersack 1996:101-109). It follows that acquiring a windfall of white wealth (the common fantasy) bore the same implication as, and was tantamount to, ascending to the sky: the replacement of a troublesome with a trouble-free lifestyle. Among Ipili speakers, I would further suggest, these expectations were in play whether or not the acquisition of white wealth motivated cult participation. What was common to all Ipili versions of the Cult of Ain was participants' desire to ascend to the sky. Where white wealth was sought, this was coupled with the desire to ascend to the sky, manifested tragically in Ipiyama's followers' fatal effort to access the sky and its wealth by entering what was thought to be a passageway to it: Lake Tindipa. RETHINKING THE CULT OF AIN According to 'The Sun and the Shakers,' the first mention of an ascent to the sky came in the Porgerà valley, where the sons of Ain spoke of the failure of traditional ritual to avert recent calamities and urged a turning to the sun, 'our father,' who would guarantee that, if people 234</page><page sequence="11">Biersack performed the new rituals, 'they and their pigs would enter the sky-world, to live there in good health for ever' (Meggitt 1974a:27). Yet Meggitt's initial reporting on the cult at Tumundan indicated that a skyward ascent was promised there. At Tumundan participants were assured that 'all who killed their pigs in a certain manner, eschewed the old rituals and obeyed certain prohibitions would supernaturally receive great wealth in pigs and goods. They would take these with them when they ascended into the sky to live forever with Jaljakali [a.k.a. Yalyakali], the sky being' (1956:117). This is corroborated by Patrol Officer T. Dwyer's 1952 account, written four years before Meggitt's article was published. 'If the pigs were killed on a platform rather than on the ground then it was explained that the sun would be more easily appeased. For everyone who died went to live on the sun and should the sacrifices be carried out as ION [the cult leader] suggested then the dead would be brought back to this earth to live on their former land' (Wabag Patrol Report 2,1952-1953:12). Indeed, the theme of a skyward ascent was present as early as 1938 at Wailya, a Tayato Enga location, in what Jacka dubs Kaiyamba's Cult (2002:201). Jacka proposes that the millenarian aspects of the cult at Tipinini and Tumundan stem from Kaiyamba's Cult because, according to him, the cult approached Tipinini and Tumundan through Wailya. But this begs the question of how it was that Kaiyamba came to imagine an ascent to the sky in the first place. I would suggest, with all due respect, that the theme of an ascent to the sky was present at the very inception of the Cult of Ain. During a six-week stay at Tipinini in 1993,1 spoke with a man named Kaiya—a distant relative of Wambilipi, he said—who was born at Lyeimi and who participated in the cult at Lyeimi. Kaiya told me that spears were stood up with the tips pointing upward and that pigs were hoisted up on the roof of a sangai house the cult leaders had built and held up toward the sun as the sun was invoked. More to the point, participants were told that they would go to the sky, the 'good ground,' he said. The purpose of the ritual was to purge the earth of whatever was inferior there, presumably to receive better in the sky. Even without a promised ascent to the sky, the sky and its occupants were clearly the focus of all versions of the Cult of Ain. The stylistics of the focal rite, a massive prestation of pigs to the sun, signaled a shift from communicating and transacting with ancestral or demonic spirits to beseeching the sun for aid. Sacrificing pigs to the sun on houses and/or platforms that were built high (in some cases, explicitly to draw closer to the sun) was common to all versions of the cult. The very form of such sacrifices—pigs' noses were held up in invocation of the sun instead of pointed downward toward demonic attacking spirits —inverted and thus repudiated traditional sacrifice, which utilized the earth and not the sky as a medium of communication and exchange with spirits. The implication of holding pigs' noses up toward the sky instead of pressing them downward into the earth was lost on no one with whom I discussed the cult. Viewed as gesture and theater, the cult from the beginning proselytized a radical transformation in cosmological orientation: away from the earth and toward the sky. In addition, cult leaders declared themselves to be sky people and/or the offspring of the sun, and/or they were presumed to be sky people by participants, participants understood themselves to become sky people through ritual participation, and, in some areas, 'sky water' was drunk. Moreover, the pits of water and the one pool (Lake Tindipa) that were used to access wealth appear to have functioned as sky spaces, their surfaces reflecting the sky and (to the minds of participants) its wealth. Traditionally such pools were thought to be the abode of the ancestors, to whom sacrifices were made whenever there was trouble of the sort Meggitt chronicles in the years preceding the Cult of Ain (see Meggitt 1965:118-120 on the Mae Enga and Biersack 1999:73-74 on Ipili speakers). The deployment of these pools and of pool-like water-filled pits in several versions of the Cult of Ain suggests a revolution comparable to the revolution inherent in holding pigs' snouts up to the sun: a turning away from those spirits of old who were associated with the earth and/or its lakes and a turning toward the sky, with its imagined bounty. Meggitt's article was called 'The Sun and the Shakers,' and in many, perhaps most or all 235</page><page sequence="12">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two places where the Cult of Ain attracted followers, looking at the sun and shaking occurred. This is one of the most unexplored aspects of the cult, with respect both to the shaking and the sun. Sharp provides some insight. '... when offering cooked meat of sacrificed pigs while standing on a high platform L. [the cult leader] stared at the sun and his body shook violently.... Observers felt at this time that he was communicating directly with the sun deity, because cultural expectation is that shaking means communication with spirits' (1990:114). Similarly, Jacka tells us that, as Wambilip moved south of Mt. Tongapipi, where so many Tipininians died, and entered Waka Enga territory, he 'would go into the forest and talk to the sun and receive visions' (2002:204) that guided him in the fashioning of his cult. 'Wambilipa went outside and held up five spears to the sun and started talking to the sun' (ibid.). Patrol Officer Graham Hardy talked to Wambilipi in April 1957, reporting that Wambilipi claimed 'to have had inspirations from God, personified by the Sun, who appointed him a headman' (Laiagam Patrol Report 3,1956-1957:11). Wambilipi also said that the sun had given him two spears (ibid.), suggesting, perhaps, that the spears along which cult leaders and participants looked as they stared at the sun were understood to be channels of communication with the sun. In discussing the restrictions Wambilipi imposed upon participants, he indicated that one of his brothers, since deceased, had given him the idea for these, and that his brother was 'God's mouthpiece. Since then, God puts these ideas in his mind but does not actually speak to him' (ibid.). (Hardy makes it clear that Wambilipi was at the time of his writing conversant in Christian cosmology, yet he also writes that Wambilipi had no contacts with white people before 1954 or 1955, when he visited an apostolic mission at Laiagam [ibid.]). Why the sun? In the Ipili context, the answer is clear to me. The sun was viewed as the source of all knowledge or mana. Looking along the shaft of the spear at the sun was not only a way of communicating with the sun but of learning from him. Those who looked at the sun along spear shafts learned new mana or knowledge in preparation for conducting their lives in new and better ways. Within the ritual context, Ain's messages were supplemented or altered with new intelligence, communicated directly from the source of all knowledge. Shakers sometimes spoke gibberish, believed to be the words of the sun. Meggitt himself understood that the Cult of Ain fundamentally concerned a reorientation to the sky. At the close of 'The Sun and the Shakers,' he observes, ... although Ain's cult originally and through most of its subsequent expressions aimed at enlisting the aid of the sun, "the father of us all", and his offspring, the sky people, there was no concern to invoke the more recent terrestrial ancestors of the local groups... . Nobody performed rites at cemeteries or elsewhere in order to ensure the return of the recent or more distant ancestors or to enable the living to join them. Nor was there any notion of a miraculous transformation of the existing terrestrial world ... (1974a:51). It is as if the earth had already been abandoned as participants, in a posture of ex-stasis, stared at the sun and shook, seeking deliverance from the terrestrial order. One gets a sense of this in Piawu's description of how cult participants returned to their houses, having participated in a mass sacrifice of pigs and in the communal washing: they walked on logs, he said, so that their legs would not touch the ground. If the legs touched the ground, participants would not go to the sky and would die, he said. 'We did everything so that we would go to the sky [tawe toko pula].' Meggitt interprets the millenarian turn in the Porgerà valley as 'a logical extension of the belief prevailing throughout the area in the existence of a celestial world inhabited by the immortal offspring of the sun and the moon' (ibid.:27). He adds that 'in the opinion of many, ... the powerful wealthy and seemingly indestructible Europeans' (ibid.) were thought to come from this realm as well, suggesting that their appearance in the area could have been viewed as a millenarian sign. As the section on interpreting mata kamo indicates, I do not disagree with 236</page><page sequence="13">Biersack this argument. But if there was no millenarian turn in the Porgerà valley, if the cult all along had been millenarian in the sense of actively seeking a celestial home for participants, then what cult participants shared must have been something like the sky/earth cosmology I outlined above. Did they? The Somaip cosmology, as outlined by Reithofer, resonates strongly with Ipili cosmology: In stark contrast to the sky world's lightness (in all its meanings), the terrestrial is the realm of toil and hardship, decay and death. While celestial life is tsasop (light, easy), earthly existence is considered kent (heavy, burdensome). Earth (su) is the place where, as the narrator chanted, 'people die and the lindil fungi rot'. The lind.il fungi with their short... life-cycle epitomize earthly existence ... [for] all life on [earth] ... is bounded by the terminal poles of fruiting and rotting, growth and decline, birth and death. This is the unremitting law of the ground ... (Reithofer 2006:49). The purpose of Ip Tand, the Somaip version of the cult, was to escape the fate of earthlings by ascending to the sky, there to live 'in abundant wealth and without the constraints of ageing, sickness or death' (ibid.:207). The Somaip sun, meanwhile, although not presented as a 'maker' or creator, is, like the Ipili sun, 'the quintessential symbol of the transcendent and permanent aspect of the sky' (ibid.:62). What, then, of Engas? The best source on these matters, at least for Central Engas, is Paul Brennan's essay 'Let Sleeping Snakes Lie.' There Brennan tells us that Aitawe was a male deity who was symbolized by the sun. 'As the creator of all things, he exists in a position of unique superiority to all beings and forces' (1977:15). The sky was a realm that in every particular contrasted with the earth. 'Food is readily available without the usual burdensome toil demanded on the empirical plane' (ibid.)-on the earth, that is. Moreover, '[w]ater ... is in abundant supply, because it flows from the "water of life" ... , a common feature of the sky realm' (ibid.). The sun lived in the sky with the moon and sky beings (1977:16), and the 'world of the sky beings' is ideal (ibid.:27), free of 'tensions born from toil, sickness, and friction' (ibid.). The sky beings had drunk the 'water of life' and been made immortal as a result (ibid.: 16). They had wanted to make human beings immortal like themselves, but human mothers gave their children the breast instead of the 'water of life,' 'and thereafter all the burdenless accoutrements of the sky world were, of necessity, exchanged for the care and toil known to earthlings' (ibid.; see also Wiessner and Tumu 1998:181; cf. Ballard 1998:74; Goldman 1983:93-94; Reithofer 2006:51). Brennan faults Meggitt and other researchers for ignoring 'Aitawe entirely' (1977:54, n. 21). However, Meggitt did report that the sun was 'the symbol of the sky world' (1965:108), and he did characterize that world in ways that are consistent with Brennan's depictions. The sun and moon bore sky beings, who founded the various phratries on earth (ibid.: 107). As among Ipili speakers, sky beings have a better quality of life than human beings have. They are the immortal descendants of the sun and moon, and they live in a perfect world. 'They represented "prosperity past'" (Wiessner and Tumu 2001:304-05). 'Because of the behaviour of the sky beings in the past, it is the lot of the Mae [a Central Enga group] to be gardeners and warriors. Men must toil to wrest a meager livelihood from a harsh environment in which violent death is ... an everyday occurrence' (Meggitt 1965:108)." Indeed, it was the fantasy of a workless, affluent life that seemed most preposterous to those who, in the cult's aftermath, as it became clear that prophesies concerning wealth acquisition and/or ascent into the sky were false, denounced the Cult of Ain. 'The kind of pragmatism generally prevalent throughout these societies started to reappear, expressed in statements such as: "We have always had to toil hard for everything we possess; can we now rely on getting wealth without working?"' (1974a:47).' If this is true, then the argument that involvement in a regional ritual system accounted for who did and who did not participate in the Cult of Ain may be correct but for reasons other 237</page><page sequence="14">The Sun and the Shakers, Again, Part Two than those Wiessner and Tumu adduce. Through dindi gamu a cluster of ethnicities shouldered their custodial responsibilities to the earth, given its propensity to decline. But if participants in the Cult of Ain looked to the sky for deliverance from this problematic terrestrial order, there would have been no further need to assume the burden of stewardship. The need, rather, was to transition skyward, the real project of the Cult of Ain. Dindi gamu offered only a temporary solution to the earth's mutability and fundamental transience. The trend of deterioration would be reversed within an unending cycle of decline and renewal, death (Ballard 1995) and rebirth. The solution the Cult of Ain offered was far better: the permanent solution of transcendence. Ethnicities that participated in dindi gamu, or in dindi gamu-Yike, rituals would have found a wealth of meaning in the skyward deliverance the Cult of Ain seemed to promise. By the same token, the sometime anticipation of a recurrence of a 'time of darkness' in the Cult of Ain context must not be explained in terms of the dindi gamu project of revitalizing the earth. According to 'time of darkness' lore, tephra falls from the sky, restoring in the long run the fertility of the earth. But ascent to the sky, rather than a revitalization of the earth, is what participants seemed to have wanted. This is clear enough in Wiessner and Tumu's own account (inspired by Meggitt 1974a:28-29) of why this recurrence was so eagerly anticipated: Large houses were constructed to accommodate communities during the predicted ash fall and keep them safe until cult leaders called on the sun to disperse the darkness. When this was achieved, it was believed that enormous pythons would hang from the sky so that people would make their way to the sky world along paths formed by the bodies of snakes. People would escape disaster on earth by returning to their point of origin as "sky people" (2001:316; emphasis added). Similarly, Jacka reports that Tipininians believed that the 'time of darkness' would occur fust before ascending the sky bridge' (2002:205; emphasis added). Some Somaip, meanwhile, understood cult leaders to have promised an ascent to the sky after the ash had fallen. Reithofer also tells us that the posts of the houses built to shelter participants were fashioned (like the hoop prop of the snake-dance) from 'ascension trees,' and the houses themselves were built 'very tall as if to reach up to the sky' (2006:204). If the 'time of darkness' anticipated by Cult of Ain participants was associated with an ascent to the sky and not the dindi gamu project of revitalizing the earth, then Reithofer's conclusion with respect to the Somaip—that the time of darkness served to mark an epochal break, a major transformation—becomes generalizable. Was not the anticipated 'time of darkness' understood to be preliminary to a new era of light: the eternal solar light of the sky world? CONCLUSIONS Most writers on the Cult of Ain have debated which theme, the theme of wealth acquisition or the theme of an ascent to the sky, was the more prominent. Using my understanding of Ipili speakers, I have suggested that these two goals not only did not compete but were substantially the same. To receive an abundance of superior wealth by trading in the old for the new wealth was to partake of a new material order, one that appeared to lack the zero-sum logic of the old order. Instead of receiving benefits commensurate with the steep costs incurred (wealth for hard work), one would receive free benefits; instead of reproducing life only at the cost of life, one would reproduce without penalty. In any case, given immortality, there would be no need for reproduction. The idea of ascending to the sky and, more prosaically, the idea that white people were sky people captured the same shift in the circumstances of human life, and it did so using cosmological discourse. Feil argues that aspects of the Cult of Ain (the sky theme, for example) suggest syncretism with Christianity, implying, then, that the Cult of Ain is to be explained in terms 238</page><page sequence="15">Biersack of Christian influence (1983:98-99). It is possible to turn this argument around, however— to wit, an indigenous sky theme prepared fertile ground for missionization and Enga, Ipili, or Somaip Christianities and that the Cult of Ain is to be explained cosmologically, in terms of indigenous tropes and philosophies (cf. Strathern and Stewart 2009). I would suggest that missionization succeeded in this part of the highlands for the same reason the Cult of Ain succeeded: indigenous understandings of the human condition and its relation to the superhuman primed Engas, Ipili speakers, and Somaips for what was largely a ritual rather than a doctrinal conversion. The first such conversion occurred in the mid-1940s; the second occurred in the 1950s for Engas and in the 1960s for Somaips and Ipili speakers, when Christian missionaries first arrived. In both cases the novelty of the rituals lay in their pragmatics: the promise they held for participants to ascend to the sky. As already indicated, participants and others uniformly consider the Cult of Ain to have been a failure in the short run but a success in the long run, culminating in today's promise of heaven for those who have ritually and morally prepared themselves as well as in today's broad-ranging 'development,' which improves health care and transportation and which sets some Engas, Ipili speakers, and Somaips on a path toward monetization and a life of relative ease, considering the hardships of the horticultural past. At base this cultural history concerns improving if not utterly transforming the material circumstances of human life, and it may thus be pursued through the secular strategies of 'development' no less than through the exotic supernatural strategies of the Cult of Ain and its successor, various indigenized Christianities (see Reithofer 2006). An incipient colonial administration may have suppressed the Cult of Ain, but it did not eradicate the imagination that inspired and sustained it and of which the Cult of Ain was only one manifestation.

Wiessner and Tumu imply that the term awalo might be the Ipili equivalent of dìndi gamu in the Huli context (1998:442, n. 18). Awalo anda is the name of a ritual performed at Tipinini. I would suggest that awalo anda is a ritual site within the dìndi gamu system, not the Ipili name for that system (Biersack 1998a:52-60; see also Jacka 2003:151-56, 167-70). The term entropy has been frequently used to capture a sense that 'the "natural" tendency in all things [is] towards loss and decline' (Ballard 1995:131; see Ballard 1994:133, 1995:131-39, 1998:73-76, 2000:206-09: Frankel 1986:18, 26 ff.; Reithofer 2006:54-55; Stiirzenhofecker 1995:92, 1998:42; and Wiessner and Tumu 1998:186-87,2001:308). Dan Jorgensen was the first to use the term to capture indigenous perspectives on the material world and its tendencies. In his dissertation 'Taro and Arrows,' entropy translates the Telefol word biniman, meaning 'to finish, to run out, to dissipate, to become nothing'(1981:304; quoted in Ballard 1995:132). Entropy, according to Jorgensen, is 'a measure of the amount of disorder in a physical system' (1981:33, quoted in Ballard 1995:132). Less abstractly, entropy refers to 'a leakage or attrition from the centre and a diminution over time in the size of people, of taro plants, and of pigs, "a gradient of progressive decline and decay in both spatial and temporal dimensions'" (Jorgensen 1981:303, quoted in Ballard 1995:132). My problem with this term is that it is far too abstract to signify processes that are at base anthropomorphic (Biersack 1995a:22). This is very clear in Reithofer's account of what he means in using the word entropy to describe Somaip views: 'Like humans, the earth does not stay forever young; it grows older and loses its vibrancy, as its fertile "ground grease" (sui pa) gradually leaks away' (2006:54). Similarly, Frankel reports images of decline that are clearly images of human aging and death. In the Huli worldview, 'At the beginning ... the earth was new and moist, but it must [desiccate] and age as the human body does' (1986:24). A third branch is said to have continued from Tondaka northeastward to Bibipaite (a.k.a. Mbibi Baite), at which point the root of the earth ascended to the sky (Frankel 1986:23). According to Wiessner and Tumu, 'Enga who participated in the Dindi Gamu at Porgerà and Tondaka say that this is incorrect, that there is no Dindi Gamu site called Bibipaite in this region... . the Huli say that Bipipaite is in the Paiela area (Chris Ballard, personal communication 1997)' (1998:442-43, n. 19; see Ballard 1994:143, figure 5). Ballard places it north of Taiyundika (a.k.a. Tai Yundiga, Yundika), which lies north of Tari and south of the Paiela valley (1994:143, figure 5), so perhaps somewhere in the Paiela valley. The Duna, living west of the Huli, subscribed to 'earth making' and 'earth straightening' (rindi kiniya) rituals that culminated in Gelote, a key Huli site for dindi gamu rituals (Stewart and Strathern 2002:71-73; Stiirzenhofecker 1995, 1998:68-71). As with dindi gamu rituals, these rituals were performed serially along a ritual track or tracks. Ipili speakers were not alone in setting a generational limit on the 'life' of any one earth. Stewart and Strathern set the Duna number at 14 (2002:80). Stiirzenhofecker suggests 'between 10 and 13 generations from the founders' (1995:92; see also 1998:65-66). Engas 'believed that the end of the world would occur ... during the thirteenth generation' (Wiessner and Tumu 2001:309; see also Wiessner and Tumu 1998:187). Huli appear to have expected 'epochs' to have ended in the 15th generation (Frankel 1986:24). Most of these pools were artificial. Pits were dug and then filled with water. They were dug around the perimeter of dancegrounds. Ipili speakers, and my guess is other ethnic groups caught up in the cult, convene on dancegrounds at midday when the sun is brightest. Ostensibly spatial, dancegrounds are really slices of spacetime (see Munn 1992)—the time and the space of the sun. There is some disagreement among those who have studied Engan cosmology. In contrast to Meggitt (1965) and Brennan (1977), for example, Bulmer reports for the Kyaka Enga that there was no 'special mythological or religious significance ascribed to the sun and the moon' (1965:137). Similarly, Feil stipulates for the Tombema Enga that 'there are no aspects of traditional Tombema religion which emphasize the importance of the sun and moon as progenitors ... , nor which include the taking up into the sky of mythic heroes or other humans' (1983:98). Bashkow's wonderful book, The Meanings of Whitemen, on the perceptions of white men of the Orokaiva, a people living in the southeastern tip of Papua New Guinea, provides reason to believe that the perception of white people as essentially laborless was widespread. According to Bashkow, the Orokaiva were especially perplexed by the fact that white men were wealthy but did no hard work. In their own lives, they knew that wealth came from body-punishing hard work. But the skins of whitemen were soft, like a girl's. '... whitemen seem to be living in a blessed Edenic state in which wealth comes without difficult toil' (2006:119). An important aspect of Ipili perceptions of white men, even white women, is that, although they are spared hard work, they are relatively rich. Ballard has urged us to think the 'time of darkness' in terms of the cosmologies that sustain such a notion (1998:69). Thinking symbolically rather than historically or ecologically, then, it is surely important that the Huli, for example, think of the tephraas 'sky stuff' (ibid.:71) (an epithet used by the Somaip as well [Reithofer 2006:57]), as 'earth of darkness' (Ballard 1998:71), and as '[g]round and sky mixed together' (ibid.:72): as a confounding or deconstruction, then, of the sky/earth cosmos. 'Times of darkness' have their onset in the daytime, and a similar confounding of the categories occurs with the notion of a daytime darkness. According to Ballard, 'In conventional narratives, mbingi involves the inversion of sky and land, an event of terrifying 240</page><page sequence="17">Biersack chaos in which "ground and sky are thrown together'" (ibid.:214) in an 'eschaton,... an apocalyptic cataclysm' (2000:213). In the Paiela valley, the end of the world is associated with just such a confounding of the categories: up becomes down, east becomes west, etc. 11. As one of my Oceania reviewers pointed out, there is the sense of a cultural revolution in many of the particulars of the cult. The prohibitions on intersexual congress were in some cases abandoned, as was (uniformly) the prior earth-centered ancestral regime, and there was the implication that wealth would take an entirely new form (bigger pigs, white manufactured goods replacing inferior local manufactured goods). The Tombema Enga abandoned bridewealth and the tee exchange that was so fundamental to Enga culture (Feil 1983; see also Meggitt 1974). Space does not allow the making of this argument adequately, but I would suggest the following. The cultures of the peoples who participated in the Cult of Ain were designed to be instruments for dealing with the realities of human existence, as locally understood. The cult's seeming promise—to alter these realities rendered dispensable such cultural tools. The millennium as imagined was postcultural. As Feil has written, 'When the Tombema-Enga abandoned the tee, they did so in favour of millenarian activity. The moral and social encumbrances of the tee gave way to a new morality and vision of a new society where the tee would not matter, or in some cases, the end of presently constituted society altogether' (1983:94). 12. It is clear from the materials I have presented that much in the cult's practices echoed prior practices, from wealth and health magic to magical procedures to grow male youth to the choice of particular woods. Meggitt himself pointed this out: 'most of the features of Ain's cult can individually be shown to be adoptions or adaptations of existing components of the traditional magico-religious systems of the Enga and the Jpili' (1974a:52). It is not surprising, surely, that leaders and participants deployed a pre-existing symbolic repertory in creating the Cult of Ain in all its rich variety. But the main point of the cult was clearly to revolutionize the prior ritual regime in its principal thrust, which was to exchange and transact with earth-associated beings, sometimes (as in dindi gamu and dindi gamu-type rituals) in the interest of preserving the earth. And, so, Meggitt's statement must be amended to read: most of the features of Ain's cult can individually be shown to be either adoptions/adaptations or inversions and transformations of existing practices. Overturning the prior ritual regime was signaled most obviously in the suppression of the kepele ritual, a key fertility ritual in Ipili (Gibbs 1978) and Enga (Wiessner and Tumu 1998:192-95) areas. More subtly, but in a way that everyone with whom I discussed the Cult of Ain understood and could articulate, the cult's manner of sacrificing pigs refuted the prior ritual regime. Platforms were built high up and the snouts of sacrificed pigs were held high up as the premier sky being, the sun, was invited to receive the prestation, reorienting participants away from the earth and toward the sky.
