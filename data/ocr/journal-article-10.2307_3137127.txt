THE HISTORICAL WRITINGS OF THE PRIESTLY SCHOOL. I. THE PRIESTLY NARRATIVE IN THE HEXATEUCH. ? 199. The New Tendency Encouraged in the Exile.- Consider (i) the effect of the exile upon the ambition of Isa.57:17-2o. Israel to be a nation among other nations of the earth; (2) the actual condition, in the exile, of all political 2Chron.35:17-21 institutions and political machinery; (3) the certainty Isa. 41:17-20o. that under these conditions the minds of the leaders and the energies of the people would be turned in some other direction; (4) the naturalness and, indeed, the Ezek., chaps. 40-48. inevitableness of a turning in the direction of a more definitely religious, as distinguished from a political, regime; (5) the foundation for this movement already Isa. 44:24-28. prepared in the two great doctrines of individualism, as preached by the priest Jeremiah, and solidarity, as Jer. 31:29f. preached by the priest Ezekiel--doctrines preached in Ezek., chaps.18, view of and in connection with the fall of the nation. 33. See J. R. SLATER, "Individualism and Solidarity as Developed by Jeremiah and Ezekiel," BIBLICAL WORLD, Vol. XIV (1899), pp. I72-83; MONTEFIORE, Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Reli- gion as Illustrated by the Religion of the Ancient Hebrews, pp. 216-19, 251-3; DUFF, Old Testament Theology, Vol. II, pp. 488 f. ?200. The Basis of This Tendency toward Priestly Influence.--Observe now three things: (I) that the 2Kings522:3- priestly influence had long been in existence, and that 23:25s. only a century or so before the fall of Jerusalem it had been greatly strengthened by the union of effort in which prophet and priest joined, and of which the promulgation of Deuteronomy was the result (cf. ?? 25-8, 170); (2) Jer. z:x; Ezek. that the prophetic work in these last days had in large ':3. measure fallen to priests, e. g., Jeremiah and Ezekiel; 443</page><page sequence="2">444 THE BIBLICAL WORLD (3) that, inasmuch as the will of God has now been pre- sented so clearly in the prophetic word (for prophecy has practically completed its work, having reached its highest development in Jeremiah) and in the written law (the 2 Kings 22:3: law as found in Deuteronomy having been canonized in 23:3. 621 B. C.), the task that remains is not so much the revelation of new truth as the interpretation, organiza- tion, and application of the great body of truth already Deut. io:8. known. Such ministration is the work of the priest. ?201. The Origin of the Idea of the Church or Com- munity.---Consider now to what extent the idea and Exod. 20o:23- practice of the community or church (I) are the further 23: 33; Deut., chaps. 16-26. development of the priestly conception and ritual which existed before the exile and was formulated during the Ezek., chaps. exile by Ezekiel in his visions; and (2) are the direct 4o-48. outcome of the prophetic teaching of individualism and solidarity (see above); and still further (3) the necessary result of the historical forces which combined to destroy the nation and put an end to prophetic work and lead- ership. ? 202. The Purpose of the Church.--(i) Study, as widely as possible (e. g., in Ezekiel's code, the Levitical code, and the priestly prophets), the purpose of the church as it now began to take the place of the nation, Mal. 1:6-14; as that purpose exhibited itself (a) in the emphasis placed Zech. 4" :56 fi. Leviticus. on worship, (b) in the multiplication of ordinances seek- ing to preserve, organize, and develop the ritual of the temple; and (2) note how greatly such interest (already Hag. i:7-14; existing in the exile) would be strengthened when the 2:1-9: Zech. 6:9-14. return had taken place, the temple had been rebuilt, and worship had actually been established in the new envi- ronment. S203. The Desire to Prepare Histories of Worship.- Consider how, under these circumstances, there would Cf. P (below). come into existence the desire (i) to trace the beginnings of these ordinances to the earliest times, and to show the place assigned them under the great leaders of the past; (2) to write a narrative which would present their history through the long centuries from David's time Cf. Chronicles. down to the last days - a story parallel with that other</page><page sequence="3">LITERATURE OF WORSHIP IN OLD TESTAMENT 445 narrative (prepared by the prophets who had now passed away) which, in representing prophetic truth, had almost entirely ignored the priest-side of the national history; and (3) to show just how these institutions were finally reinstated or re-established after the return by the great Cf. Ezra and leaders Ezra and Nehemiah. This desire found its reali- zation in what we may call the histories of the priestly school. ? 204. The Histories of the Prophetic School.- Recall (I) the history of J, the work of a Judean prqphet, prob- Gen. 2:"4b-4:26; ably the oldest of the prophetic histories, which gathers up the stories and traditions of the earliest times down to the settlement of Israel in Canaan and uses all this material for the purpose of illustrating and enforcing the truths of prophecy;' (2) the history of E, which Gen. 15:x, 5, i6; chap. so; etc. covers practically the same ground as J, but is written from the point of view of northern Israel, and is somewhat less naive in its conception of God and in respect to other theological ideas; 2 (3) the histories found in Judges, Samuel, and Kings, which trace the progress of the nation from the conquest to the exile; and note the principal characteristics, common to them all, viz.: 2 Sam. :x8; I Kings x : 4x ; (a) that they are in large part compilations of older 4:29; 2 Kings 15:26; etc. material; (b) the emphasis laid by them upon the 2 Kings, chap. 24.

The Priestly Histories.- Under this head may be classified (i) the priestly narrative in the Hexateuch; (2) the books of Chronicles, which furnish a parallel history, as understood by the priest, for the entire period covered by the prophetic history found in See above. Judges, Samuel, and Kings; and (3) the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which describe the restoration from exile and the re-establishment of the temple and its elaborate system of worship. These all possess the same general characteristics of style, are controlled by the same theological ideas, are interested in the same general subject, and are written from the same priestly point of view. ? 206. The Historical Character of the Priestly His- tories.- Keep in mind (i) the purpose of these so-called histories, viz., to represent the priest-side, that is, the element of worship; (2) the consequent necessity of making selections from the large body of material in existence; (3) the fragmentary and disconnected char- acter of the material which comes by selection ; (4) the only method that, under these circumstances, can be employed--that of compilation; (5) the danger of confusion and disorder; (6) the certainty that material having its origin centuries after the event described will not be intended to serve as a chronicle of the event, but rather to meet some definite and practical end in view; (7) the difference between actual history and idealized story; (8) the meaning of the word "'pragmatic " as applied to history.

The Scope of the Priestly Narrative.--This document is found alongside of the prophetical histories J and E in the Hexateuch.3 Like them it goes back to the time of creation and sketches the course of events Gen.I:I--2:4a; up to the settlement of Israel in Canaan. his leads it osh., chaps.14, in many cases to duplicate the narratives of the pro- phetic historians; but, although the same events are Gen. 34:1, 2a,3b, often narrated in both accounts, the point of view is 42 0 - 2-, widely different, since the purposes of the two schools C. 34:2 b,i3a3c, of writers are of a different character. The priestly nar- rative is primarily concerned with questions like (a) the divine choice of Israel as the peculiar people of God; (b) the divine origin of her system of worship; (c) the growth of the accompanying institutions and customs. ? 208. The Gradual Growth of the Priestly Narrative.- A careful examination of this priestly narrative reveals that it is not all the work of one hand or one time, but, like the prophetic histories, is a compilation of older 3 The material belonging to the priestly narrative, as indicated in The Hexateuch by J. E. CARPENTER AND G. HARFORD-BATTERSBY, is as follows: Gen.

This ap- pears (a) from the fact that there are many repetitions Exod., chaps. 25- within the priestly narrative itself, e. g., the repetition of 30, cf. 35-40; Numb., chaps. the account of the structure of the tabernacle, the double 1-3, cf. 26 ; Lev., chap. 23, cf. account of the census of Israel, the two recensions of Numb., chaps. 28,29. the laws concerning feasts, etc.; and (b) from the differ- ent tone and character of various parts of the narrative. It is now generally granted that there are at least four different strata in this work. These are (i) a continuous narrative from the creation to the settlement in Canaan, which forms the groundwork of the priestly narrative Lev.,chaps.17-26.

The Sources of the Priestly Narrative.- (i) 7:1-5, 7-1o, etc.; cf.6:9-22; Examine carefully some of the narratives contained in 7: 6, xx, etc. both the prophetic history and in the priestly narrative, e. g., the accounts of the deluge, the story of Dinah,4 the bringing of water from the rock in the wilderness,5 etc., and consider whether the prophetic and priestly writers are to be regarded (a) as having used the same sources, or (b) as having used different sources, or (c) as being dependent one upon the other; if the latter, which is the original ?

In cases where the priestly and prophetic accounts of the same event differ widely, e. g., in the accounts of the events at Sinai,6 what explanation may be given ?7 Is the difference to be explained as due to the use of vary- ing sources or as a result of the different point of view and purpose of these writers ? (3) Compare the creation accounts of J and P with Gen.zx:x--:4a; c/. Gen. 2:4b- each other, and still further with the creation stories as 24. found on Babylonian tablets. Note carefully the points of resemblance and difference, and try to determine (a) which of the two shows the clearer traces of Babylonian influence; (b) whether they both resemble the same Babylonian tradition; or (c) whether each reflects a different Babylonian tradition. (d) If the Babylonian accounts are considered as sources of the Hebrew nar- ratives, note how thoroughly the Hebrew writers have edited their sources and the different style of editing done by P as compared with J. For English translations of these Babylonian stories see W. MUss-ARNOLT's rendering in R. F. HARPER'S Assyrian and Babylo- nian Literature (" The World's Great Books," Aldine edition, New York, 1901), pp. 282-300.

The Legislation Embodied in the Priestly Narrative.-- Note that, just as the prophetic histories Exod. 34:x-28. included some elements of legislation, viz., the smaller Book of the Covenant in J, and the greater Book of the Exod. 20:23- Covenant, with the Decalogue (Exod. 20: 1-17), in E, 23:3; 2o:-x17. so the priestly narrative contains its proportion of laws. 6For the distribution of material among the various sources in Exod., chaps. 19-40, in the book of Leviticus, and in Numb., chaps. I-io, see the literature cited in note I. 7 Other stories which are thought to be duplicates are : (I) the account of the birth of Hagar, etc., in Gen., chap. 16 (P = 16 : la, 3, 15, I6; the remainder belongs to J); (2) the birth of Isaac (P = Gen. 21: ib, 2b, 3-5; the remainder belongs to J and E): the revelation of God to Jacob at Bethel (P = Gen. 35 : 6a, 9-13, 15; the remainder belongs to J and E).</page><page sequence="8">450 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Exod. 12:z-2o, This legal element is found in portions of Exodus and 25 f., 43-49; 13: ; 25:1 - Numbers and in the entire book of Leviticus. (I) Notice 31: 17; chaps. 35-40; Numb. the relatively large amount of space and consideration 5: 1-9: 10; chaps. 15, i8, given to legal matters in P, as compared with J and E. 1g, 28-31, and 35. Is it not true that in J and E the legal material is inci- dental, while in P it is the essential and all-important thing ? (2) How may this increase of legal material be accounted for ? Is it perhaps due to the greater interest of the priestly writers in such matters ? ? 2 1 . Orderly, Systematic Treatment of Material.- Gen. :1-2:4a. Read the priestly narrative of the creation, and (i) notice that the order of events is carefully distributed through- out six days, corresponding to the working days of the week, and that God is represented as resting upon the Gen. 2:4a-25. seventh day. (2) Is not the whole account much more systematic than the prophetic account of the same sub- Gen. 2:4a; 5: 1; ject in the following chapter ? (3) Consider also the 6: 9; o:1; 11:10; 11:27; division of the patriarchal period into ten "generations," 25: 12; 25: Ig; se: I; 37:2. beginning with the "generations of the heaven and of the earth,"8 and ending with the generations of Jacob. (4) Notice that prior to the time of Abraham the gen- Gen. i: i; 8:I; eral name elohim is used; between Abraham and Moses etc. Gen. 17: I. the name el shaddai appears; after Moses' time the Exod. 6:2f. name is Jehovah. (5) Observe the similar system which appears in the presentation of the covenant idea; the first covenant being represented as having been made Gen. 9: 8-17. with Noah, its sign-the rainbow; the second covenant Gen., chap. 17. being with Abraham, its sign--circumcision; while still Exod. 31:16f. later the sabbath is spoken of as a covenant, and as the sign of a covenant.

(2) Exod. 6:14-27; Numb. 1:5-16, Notice further the large amount of genealogical material 20, 47; 3: 4-39; 26:I-27: :z. in the priestly narratives, and that long periods of time are frequently represented by nothing more than a genea- logical list. (3) Does the writer seem to use these lists in large part as connecting links for his narrative, hasten- ing over by their means long periods of time in which he has no especial interest, in order to give more atten- tion to matters in which he is vitally concerned ? ? 213. Prevalence of Statistics and Dates in the Priestly Narrative.-In illustration of this characteristic of P Gen., chap. 5; recall the fact that it gives the ages of the antediluvians; 6:,154f.; 7:6,, the dimensions of the ark; the date of the flood; the 16:3, ;16; 1, depth of the waters of the flood and its duration; the 23:16;,46:27' age of Abraham at various junctures in his life; the price Exod. 6 : 4i ; paid for the field of Ephron ; the number of people that a5:1Off., 23, a5, entered Egypt; the duration of the sojourn in Egypt; Lev. chap. 23; Numb., chaps. the date of the arrival in the wilderness of Sin and of that 28, 29; chaps. 2-3,, and 26; at Sinai; the dimensions and specifications of the ark of chap. 7;34:-5. testimony, the table of shewbread, and the golden can- dlestick; most minute specifications for the tabernacle with all its furnishings; the exact dates of all feasts; a census of Israel at Sinai; the exact value of the offerings made in connection with the dedication of the altar; a careful demarkation of the boundaries of the various tribes; etc. Does not the presence of so much material of this sort render the general style stiff and precise as compared with the free, flowing narratives of J and E ? ? 2 14. The Style of the Priestly Narrative is Repetitious. --(I) Observe that the account of the structure of the Numb., chaps.26- 3o and 35-40; tabernacle is given in full twice; also that the census of chaps. 1-3 and 26; 7: 13-17; Israel at Sinai is twice narrated.

The Selection of Material in the Priestly Narra- tive.-(I) Consider whether, if it is not the purpose of the priestly writers to write a history in the modern sense of the word, but rather to teach certain truths with reference to God and the proper methods of worship, it may not be reasonable to suppose that they selected and arranged their material with a view to its appropriateness to the end they had in view. (2) Notice, for example, (a) that, Gen. i:i -2:4a. while in J the narrative of the creation is merely intro- ductory to the account of man's first sin, in P the cre- ation narrative is treated in a manner to emphasize strongly the sanctity of the sabbath; (b) that between the creation and Abraham the centuries are bridged over by means of genealogies, with the single exception of the deluge and the account of the covenant with Noah; (c) Gen., chap. 17. that the only incidents in Abraham's life to which P gives any consideration are the account of the institu- Gen., chap. 23. tion of circumcision with the accompanying covenant, Gen. 28:i-9. and the purchase of the field of Ephron ; (d) that the only incident treated in the life of Isaac is the care taken to provide for his son's marriage to a woman of Gen.34: f.,36, 4, his own race; and in Jacob's life the failure of the pro- 6, 8-io, I2-18, etc.; 35:9-13, posed alliance between the sons of Jacob and the men I5: 46: 6-27. of Shechem, the appearance of God to him at Bethel with the promise to bless his descendants, and his entrance into Egypt with his sons; (e) that in the Exod. 12: 1-20o, account of the exodus the only incidents receiving any considerable attention are the institution of the Passover, Exod., chaps. 25- the giving of manna on six days and its withholding on 40; Lev., chaps. 1-27: etc. the seventh, and the legislation at Sinai which consti- tutes the bulk of the priestly narrative. (3) Consider in</page><page sequence="11">LITERATURE OF WORSHIP IN OLD TESTAMENT 453 each of the above cases why the incident was chosen for treatment to the exclusion of other material, much of which would have been of more interest and value as pure history. See, e. g., GUNKEL, The Legends of Genesis, pp. 146 f.; HOL- ZINGER, Einleitung in den Hexateuch, pp. 359 f. ? 216. The Theological Point of View of the Priestly Narrative.--() Is not the conception of God that appears in the priestly narrative in many respects the highest attained in the Old Testament ? (2) Note that in the creation account of P, as compared with that of J, all anthropomorphic features are lacking; it is sufficient for Gen. 1:I-2:44a. God to speak and the thing is done. He is most holy, so that none but members of the holiest class may come Numb.. chap. 18; near his altar or perform the highest functions of his wor- Lev., chap. 8. ship; and these ministers are set apart by a most solemn service of consecration. The usual manifestation of his presence is by means of a cloud resting upon the tent Exod. 4o:34ff : of meeting and the appearance of his "glory." In the NUmb.16:19g. presence of such a holy Being the sinfulness of man is greatly intensified; constant sacrifices are necessary to make atonement; and there is an obligation resting upon Lev. x9:2. all Israel to be holy, because God is holy. This exalted conception of God can be traced everywhere in the nar- rative and in the legislation. (3) To what extent is it due to this conception of God and of Israel's relation to him that the accounts of Israel's ancestors differ so widely in spirit from the corresponding narratives of J and E ? (4) Consider the significance of the fact that none of the sins and shortcomings of the patriarchs, so freely mentioned by the prophetic writers, are alluded to in the priestly narrative; the patriarchs being looked upon as the founders of the holy nation and, as such, they must themselves have been holy. (5) Note also that no sacrifices are offered nor altars built by the patriarchs according to the priestly narrative, in contrast with the Gen. 35:6, gff.; prophetic account, because sacrifice was not legal until f. 35:7. the Mosaic legislation had been given and the proper means for the right conduct of sacrifice provided.</page><page sequence="12">4 4 THE BIBLICAL WORLD See, e. g., DRIVER, Introduction to the Literature of the Old Tes- tament (6th ed), pp. 128 f.; J.

Constructive Work. i. Prepare a brief survey of early Israelitish history from the pas- sages ordinarily assigned to P (see above), noting especially (a) the gaps which are found to exist, that is, the periods left untouched, or passed over in the genealogical method (see above); (b) the portions on which large emphasis is laid. 2. Make a list of all the so-called duplicates (cf. ? 209), that is, those events which are described by some other writer (e. g., J or E) as well as by P, and observe particularly the characteristics which distinguish the account of P from other accounts. 3. Prepare a statement which (a) will present in logical order the various elements of style that characterize P, (b) will show the relation- ship existing between these characteristics of style and the contents, and (c) will exhibit the contrast between the style of P and that of the prophetic narrators (J and E). 4. Formulate P's conception of God, and trace the influence of this conception in (a) the contents, that is, as explaining why certain things are included or omitted; (b) the style, that is, as explaining why the style is in such marked contrast, e. g., with the prophetic style; (c) the conception, that is, as explaining the thought of the writer on various subjects, e. g., man, angels, worship, etc., etc.</page></plain_text>
