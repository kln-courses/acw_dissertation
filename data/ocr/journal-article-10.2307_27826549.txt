<plain_text><page sequence="1">FUN IN THE FISH POND By LAWRENCE K. FRANK New York, N.Y. Recently Albert Bachem (American Scientist, Jfi, 20, 1954) has been duck ing various groups in his mechanistic thermodynamic pond which he asserts needs no teleological, "theophysical," or cybernetic feed-back elaborations. Provocation for his remarks came from an earlier statement by me in a sym posium, "Teleological Mechanisms" (Annals of N.Y. Academy of Science, SO, 191, 1948) when I urged that we "attempt to escape from these older mechanistic formulations that now appear inadequate, and to provide new and more fruitful conceptions and more effective methodologies of studying self regulative processes, self-orienting sys tems and organisms, and self-directing personalities."1 Despite my earnest efforts to exhibit the limitations of traditional teleology, theological animism, and contemporary "feed back," I am apparently "guilty by association." However, I would like to invite Mr. Bachem to return to his fish pond with some new bait. Obviously any "system," pond, ocean, weather, earth movements, may be interpreted in terms of thermodynamics where enormous numbers of conver gent events (cf. Irving L?ngmuir, Science, 97, 1, 1943) average out with predictable results and equilibrating operations, as in gas laws. We cannot too highly regard this great human achievement in studying "disorganized complexity"?as Warren Weaver has stated (American Scientist, 86, 1948)?and revealing "order in dis order" (Schroedinger), since the re current regularities and interactions of random events always tend to the dis order of entropy. When, however, we study "organized complexity" (Weaver), as exhibited in living organisms, ecological and social orders, we find "islands of order" which reproduce themselves and main tain persistent intercourse with the "surround." Here indeed, we confront "organization" as a persistent con figuration, a space-time structure, not a randomness tending to entropy, but operating through processes that post pone entropy, are recurrent?employ ing catalysts and enzymes to build negative entropy?that reconstitute themselves after each cycle, operating against thermodynamic gradients (ho meostatis). Even in organic molecules we must recognize the persistent struc tures of stereochemistry which block or retard entropy and maintain the spatial location of each atom in the molecular configuration with its specific "properties." As Pauling has shown, the mechanis tic conception of rigid chemical "bonds" 1 For a further elaboration of this, see the writer's Nature and Human Nature: Man's New Image of Himself, Rutgers Univ. Press, 1951.</page><page sequence="2">FRANK : FUN IN THE FISH POND 299 must be replaced with the conception of resonance, involving non-random atomic physics and persistent atomic structures sharing electrons. Fish do live in mecbanistic-thermo dynamic ponds as other organisms live on earth, where they maintain this continual intercourse with the "sur round" through processes that trans form randomness into orderly "trans actions" (Clerk Maxwell). While we may assuage our ignorance with the formula of survival of the fittest, we are still faced with the question of how organisms could arise that were able to survive?surely not by purely random thermodynamic processes that rapidly tend to entropy! Both the theological fundamentalists who invoke supernatural powers and the scientific fundamentalists who rely upon elementary operations ?f thermo dynamics, join in denying the potenti alities of the cosmos which has, over the ages, produced organisms and circular reciprocal transactions by processes that are "natural." These are expressions of the plasticity and flexibility of nature which, as Whitehead has observed, are exhibited almost uniquely in man. After all, it required human minds to observe and devise the mechanistic thermodynamic explorations of the fish pond and to recognize those fish as our ancestors, even though' they could not live in the atmosphere. Perhaps the magazine Life has an answer to this dichotomy by naturalizing the "mir acle" of water, earth, and organisms. Comments by Professor Bachem I am grateful to Lawrence K. Frank for giving the title "Fun in the Fish Pond," to my note to the editor, thus confirming its humorous attitude; I also appreciate fully the good sportman ship with which he accepted my "duck ing." I frankly admit that his extensive scientific discussion of my short note gives it more honor than it deserves. And I am pleased to accept his kind in vitation for a joint visit to my pond with "new bait." But first a little de tour: I accept almost every quotation of Dr. Frank, even the "negative entropy" of relatively isolated (organic and in organic!) systems; but I still disagree with his interpretations, such as the sharp distinction between "disorgan ized" and "organized complexity" or the "dichotomy ... of water, earth, and organisms."1 I had intentionally selected the fish pond as an object whose behavior appears intermediate between biological and physical phe nomena, thus bridging the imaginary borderline between organic and in organic sciences. I am particularly in agreement with Frank's "high regard of the great human achievement"?"to observe and devise the mechanistic-thermodynamic explo rations." Physics, as a purely empirico mathematical science, has freed itself maximally of anthropomorphic interpre tations, such as, "horror vacui" and gravitational pull as spiritistic forces, force and energy as human effort and vigor. Physiology, as a branch of phys ics, follows in the latter's footsteps, dis carding all mythological, teleological, moral, aesthetic concepts, and even abandoning the spiritistic, instrumental use of consciousness. Returning now to the fish pond with my companion's "new bait" and look ing through his multicolored sun glasses, I suddenly remember a German poem, forgotten since my childhood days: "God's world, how wonderful it is! And, too, the course each creature follows: That all may live in sated bliss, One evermore the other swallows." 1 My general bio-philosophical attitude is outlined in the articles: Complemen tarity of matter and mind, Acta Psychol., ?,322-336, 1951-52. Heisenberg's. inde terminacy principle and life, Philos, of Science, 19, 261-272, 1952 (see pp. 264 and 270). The relativity of reality, Philos. of Science, 20, 75-78, 1953.</page></plain_text>
