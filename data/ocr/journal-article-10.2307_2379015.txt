<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION PROPOSED SOURCES OF PRACTICAL WISDOM CHARNER PERRY TODAY the world is harassed by political conflicts. Chronic strife and fighting in many places and sporadic violence almost everywhere weaken the foundations of or- derly life and threaten to spread into disas- trous war. Even in peaceful areas there are harsh oppositions between groups in regard to moral and political issues. It is not sur- prising that in such conditions there should be, as indeed there is, general recognition of the need for moral and political wisdom, that is, a body or knowledge, or a method, or perhaps a discipline by which disputes might be resolved in a way which would ap- pear fair or reasonable or just to everyone willing to consider the issues with an open mind. In answer to this need there have been a large number and a bewildering variety of prescriptions as to how moral wisdom might be achieved. Humanists have suggested that increased study of the humanities might help, that men might be tamed, humanized, or civilized through acquaintance with lit- erature and the arts, that practice in the valuations involved in the appreciation of literature and the arts would make men sensitive to values and able to judge them critically. Social scientists, perhaps skeptical of the efficacy of esthetic sensitivity in po- litical affairs, have recommended extension of study and research in the social sciences. Some natural scientists have suspected that further development of the scientific atti- tude, with its disinterestedness, its subordi- nation of individual prejudice and parochial loyalties to an impersonal and therefore cosmopolitan point of view, and its willing- ness to sacrifice all lesser interests for the sake of truth, would contribute more to a new and reasonable way of handling social problems than does either the social pseudo- scientist's dabbling in the social lore and barbarous ways of prescientific man or the humanist's practice in the niceties of visual, auditory, and verbal stimulation. Many re- ligious people, of course, insist that these academic specialties would be helpful, if at all, only if subordinate to and guided by re- ligious doctrine. Whatever their ultimate merits, the pres- ent effect of these various prescriptions seems merely the setting-up of claims and counterclaims, oppositions which are not so violent or dangerous or widespread as the political oppositions but which nevertheless have the same character of being conflicts of interest or of ideologies. These academic disputes illustrate indeed what happens generally to attempts to present a reason- able basis for settling practical issues. Each doctrine which seems to its proponents a reasoned and cogent presentation seems to other people a rationalization, a dogma, or just another ideology. This seems truly the frustration of reason, the bankruptcy of human intelligence, that the urgent need for a reasonable basis for social policy and individual action should generate only ideol- ogies, an assortment of personal and group dogmas. Most of us think some of the time, and some of us all the time, that the failure to reach a common basis for moral discussion is caused by the ignorance, intellectual blindness, or original sin of our opponents. We demand that men open their eyes or change their hearts. We admit that the present generation is hopeless but demand more and better education for the next gen- eration. It is in order, however, before plac- ing all the blame on ignorance, blindness, 262</page><page sequence="2">DISCUSSION263 and original sin, to consider whether or not there are other sources of our present frus- tration in moral discussion. It may be that men are unconvinced by moral exhortations because the exhortations are really not con- vincing. It is, indeed, easy to perceive certain de- velopments in modern thought which have a tendency to uproot moral discourse, leav- ing it dangling, unsupported, in thin air. One of the great accomplishments of modern thought is the freeing of science from an- thropomorphism. Science, we have been told, should free itself so far as possible from the interests, desires, purposes, and valuations of man to achieve an impersonal description of the universe. That such de- tachment has to a great extent been ac- complished constitutes one of the great triumphs of the human reason. The suppression of anthropomorphism, however, separates science sharply from common sense. Common sense, the lan- guage and thinking of every day, is primarily a language of action in which the environ- ment and society are apprehended and de- scribed in relation to human interests, pur- poses, customs, and institutions. Common- sense thinking is deeply colored by consid- erations of good and bad, of advantage and disadvantage, of opportunity and obstacle, and these considerations are fused into the terms used in designating and describing objects or persons. Ordinary language is adapted to moral discourse because implicit in it are innumerable valuations which are taken for granted. For many moral discussions the language of common sense is adequate. It is clear enough, however, that the valuations im- plicit in common sense are a disorderly mix- ture. Valuations which are in some sense in- trinsic to the human situation are mixed with the mores of a specific society, the cus- toms of a specific age, the manners and ideology of a class, and even the prejudices and personal interests of individuals. Con- sequently, it is not surprising that when there are swift changes in customs, or op- positions between different societies, or con- flicts between classes, arguments drawn from common sense are unconvincing. Com- mon sense varies from society to society, from age to age, and from group to group. Since science is ideally and to a great de- gree actually the same for all men, ex- pressed in a language and developed by methods which provide a common basis for understanding and agreement among men of diverse groups and cultures, it is natural that men should look to science to furnish a common basis, either directly or by anal- ogy, for understanding and agreement in re- gard to moral and political problems. In- deed, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the impressive progress of natural science spread widely among men the hope that a like application of reason would soon produce a rational morality, a rational po- litical order, and even a rational religion. Without pretending to have reached the bottom of the issue, one may entertain doubts as to whether science does provide a basis for resolving moral or political prob- lems. The main reason for such doubt is spread out on the surface of the matter. Science aims at, and has to a considerable degree attained, a neutral description of the universe-a description from which human desires, interests, plans, and hopes have been removed. On the other hand, human de- sires, interests, plans, and prejudices are the essential stuff of moral and political prob- lems. The actions and transactions of men and the terms applicable to them-just, ex- pedient, successful, honorable, reasonable- have no place in scientific description. If, however, science does not provide a basis for reasonable judgments in morals and politics, where else could such basis be found? Science, if not indeed identical with reason, seems to furnish the only available example of what might be meant by reason, that is, a method or a discipline or a body of principles which should be cogent or com- pelling for all men regardless of their preju- dices, interests or cultural backgrounds. Un- less we find in science a way of escape, are we not enmeshed in prejudices and individu- al or socially determined points of view?</page><page sequence="3">264 ETHICS A blunt and unequivocal answer to this question is presented by Professor Northrop in The Logic of the Sciences and the Hu- manities.' This book is a collection of essays; and it contains both illuminating comments on specific sciences and obfuscating remarks about scientific method in general. Its im- portant message, however, is an emphatic "yes" to the above question. Though Nor- throp begins deceptively by denying that there is one scientific method and by prom- ising to present the various methods appro- priate to various sciences, it appears soon that there is only one scientific method and indeed only one logic and one way of reason- ing. His promise to describe different meth- ods has only a token redemption in a differ- entiation of stages of inquiry; and this dif- ferentiation, though useful in planning the tactics of a science at a specific time, is ir- relevant to the general issue as to whether there is more than one way of being reason- able. According to Northrop there is only one way of being reasonable, whether in the humanities, the social sciences, or religion, and that way is identified with scientific method. I suspect that a great many people have reached more or less the conclusion that Northrop states; but many of them main- taini a polite reticence or at least make some diplomatic gesture toward the feelings or academic prerogatives of humanists or social scientists, and some at least probably straddle the issue even in their own minds. It is both stimulating and helpful to have a clear-cut and emphatic assertion that all pretensions, except those deriving from science, to a competence for judging moral, political, or religious issues, are spurious. Such an assertion presents sharply the al- ternatives which confront us when we look for a reasonable basis for practical judg- ments. Northrop goes down the line of possible sources of practical wisdom and unequivo- cally rejects any claims that might be ad- vanced for the social sciences, the humani- ties, or religion. So far as social science is I New York: Macmillan, I947. Pp. xiv+402. concerned his argument is simple. Social science intends to describe society as it is; and the test which it must meet is conform- ity to the facts of society as they are. A nor- mative social theory, however, prescribes changes that should be made or a good so- ciety which is not completely realized. "Of its very nature a normative social theory departs at least in part from the de factor state of affairs to which any social theory must conform completely if it is to be veri- fied by the methods of natural science." It is evident, then, that factual social theory can furnish no reasonable ground for norma- tive social theory. To see how Northrop disposes of the hu- manities and religion as sources of moral wisdom, one must notice the distinction he makes between concepts by intuition and concepts by postulation. Concepts by intui- tion refer to experienced objects; and their full meaning is given by the presentation of the appropriate objects. Such experienced objects are not, indeed, pure experience, which is ineffable. They involve classifica- tion and description which have become so firmly established that they constitute com- mon sense; but while the objects of common- sense experience depend on conceptualiza- tion, the concepts involved are a kind "the complete meaning of which is given by some- thing which can be immediately appre- hended." Concepts by postulation, by con- trast, refer to objects which cannot be ex- perienced; and their meaning is given com- pletely by the system of postulates and definitions in which they appear. Concepts by intuition are used in com- mon sense, in literature and classical art, and in science in the classificatory and natu- ral-history stage. When such concepts are used there is apparently no serious problem of verification. Such concepts merely repre- sent to us experienced objects, and if there is doubt about the correctness of the repre- sentation we need only look at the objects. Concepts by intuition prove inadequate, however, for dealing with many problems that arise; and theories involving concepts by postulation are constructed. Such theo-</page><page sequence="4">DISCUSSION 265 ries cannot be verified by any direct appeal to experience; they must be tested by scien- tific method, that is, by the process of mak- ing deductions and checking the deductions by experiment and observation. In terms of this distinction, Northrop in- dicates two functions of art and literature. Art and literature may present or represent experience, either by suggesting as in im- pressionistic art pure experience, or by using concepts by intuition. In this first function art and literature present the "aesthetic component of reality." "The primary task of poetry, arising out of art in its first func- tion, is to convey the aesthetic component of reality in and for itself apart from all postulated doctrine and theory. Put more concretely, it must keep men continuously aware of the freshness and the ineffable beauty and richness of the immediately ap- prehended." We may add that literature and art in performing this function add nothing in the way of theory or doctrine or moral wisdom to what is immediately ap- prehended. They simply present or re-pre- sent what is directly experienced. A second function of art and literature is "to convey analogically in terms of imme- diate experienceable materials, the unob- servable theoretic component of reality which can be literally expressed only by the technical concepts by postulation of science and scientifically formulated philosophy." Northrop emphasizes strongly, however, that in this second function art and litera- ture act solely as purveyors of doctrines or theories about whose truth they are ignor- ant: ". . . it is never the poet or any other artist who is in the position to determine when he operates in this second function, whether the doctrine which he conveys ana- logically is the correct one or not." It is be- cause of this fact that "poetry, prose, paint- ing, music and sculpture are called arts rather than sciences. This is the reason, also, why a society tends to become demoralized when it tries, as the recent modern world has done, to base its theory of the good life upon the arts and the humanities, rather than upon the sciences and a scientifically determined philosophy. There is no criterion within the arts or the humanities to deter- mine whether one theory rather than an- other of the theoretic component of reality which an artist may convey analogically is the correct one. This is also the reason why it is a very dangerous thing for contempo- rary professors of English to set themselves up as competent teachers and judges of a philosophy of life." The same considerations are applied to religion. Religion may cherish the aesthetic component, moving, free of any doctrinal or theoretic commitments, in immediate ex- perience; and according to Northrop this is the alternative exploited by Eastern reli- gions. Religion may, however, contain doc- trines about the soul and God. Since God and the soul are not given in immediate ex- perience, but are unseen, they depend on inference; and "trustworthy unseen factors can be distinguished from erroneously in- ferred ones only by means of the logical and scientific methods developed by the West for making trustworthy inferences to the unseen." If religion contains any theoretic component, this component can be estab- lished only by science or by the use of scien- tific method. "This means, however, that nothing corrupts Western religion as un- equivocally and thoroughly as does the cur- rent contention in contemporary Western Protestant humanistic circles that religion and morality are things which the methods of logic and science cannot touch." Theo- logians, it seems clear, are dangerous and presumptuous when they, like professors of English, set themselves up as teachers or judges of a philosophy of life. "Moreover, it is not the business of the theologian to de- termine whether such an unseen theoretical- ly known component of reality exists or not, or what its character is. This is the business of the scientist." Northrop, then, unequivocally and em- phatically rejects any pretensions theologi- ans, humanists, poets, artists, or social scientists may have to furnish a reasonable basis for practical judgments. This summary rejection is reaffirmed in positive form when</page><page sequence="5">266 ETHICS Northrop asserts that "empirically and in- tellectually speaking, there is no such thing as ethics. There are no purely ethical facts, as there are no purely ethical meanings. There is only the nature of things and one's basic theory concerning what it is. One's philosophical presuppositions designate this basic theory. 'Good' is merely a single word for this basic theory. It is one's philosophy rather than, as modern ethical teachers sup- pose, an item, either naturalistic or idealist, within that philosophy. For any given people any conduct proceeding from its basic theory concerning the nature of things is good. Any theory or attendant conduct not in accord with these presuppositions or not given meaning by them is ethically meaningless, or bad. Thus the problem of a good society is nothing more than the problem of getting an adequate conception of the nature of things." Many people, I suspect, would agree with Northrop that natural science furnishes the only reasonable basis for any kind of judgment; but acceptance of this conclusion is frequently accompanied by the suspicion that natural science does not provide a basis for practical or normative judgments. Since the acceptance of both the conclusion and the suspicion commits one to the belief that there is no reasonable basis for normative or practical judgments, most reasonable people are inclined at this point to hedge in some way or another. Northrop, however incredible his doctrine may be, does not hedge. He rejects the sus- picion mentioned above and asserts that natural science furnishes an adequate basis for normative judgment. It is his contention that the practical judgments in any culture flow from four sets of assumptions constitut- ing the economic doctrine, the political doc- trine, the religious doctrine, and the aes- thetic doctrine of the culture. These doc- trines in turn are determined by the philoso- phy of the culture. "In fact, they are the more specialized expression of a single set of primitive concepts and postulates embrac- ing the economic theory, the political the- ory, the religious doctrine and the aesthetic forms and values in their organic intercon- nections. This common all-embracing set of primitive concepts and postulates is the philosophy of the culture in question." The philosophy of a culture, however, is a theory about nature; and a theory of na- ture is tested by scientific method. "The verification of normative social theory is to be obtained not by checking its basic philo- sophical postulates, either directly or in- directly, against the facts of society either in the present or in the future but by check- ing them with the postulates of the philos- ophy of natural science prescribed by the facts of nature. When the relation between the postulates of the philosophy of culture and the postulates of the philosophy of na- ture is that of identity, the philosophy of culture is true. When the relation is not that of identity, the philosophy of culture is false or incomplete." Northrop's doctrine depends, of course, on the supposition that the same set of defi- nitions and primitive propositions implies both descriptive propositions which may be experimentally tested and also prescriptive propositions which do not correspond to any existing state of affairs and which constitute basic principles in the prac- tical disciplines; and Northrop states this supposition explicitly. "The basic primitive concepts and postulates of the philosophy underlying a given culture have two differ- ent references, the one a prescriptive refer- ence by way of the theorems to culture, the other an empirical cognitive reference by way of the postulates to nature and the natural man. It is the former of these two references which gives a normative social theory its normative character; it is the lat- ter of its two references which provides normative social theory with its cognitive, verifiable character as true or false." Nor- throp elsewhere makes clear that in his opinion the postulates about nature are es- tablished by deducing from them proposi- tions which can be subjected to empirical test. Consequently, the same set of postu- lates yields two sets of theorems, the set of</page><page sequence="6">DISCUSSION 267 descriptive propositions by which they are tested and the prescriptive set. I see no reason to doubt the possibility of selecting a set of postulates which would imply both descriptive and prescriptive propositions; and it might be that a system could be constructed such that the descrip- tive theorems are confirmed by experimental results in the natural sciences. I should think it likely, however, that from any such sys- tem a simpler set of postulates could be con- structed which would imply all the descrip- tive theorems but none of the prescriptive theorems of the original system; and it seems to me that it would be reasonable to say that it is this second set, if it can be con- structed, which is confirmed by experimen- tal test. To put the matter in another way, since admittedly none of the prescriptive propositions is verified, it would seem logically unsound, in constructing a theory to account for the verifying propositions, to introduce components implying prescriptive (therefore unverifiable) propositions unless it is logically impossible to construct with- out such components a system adequate to account for the observable facts. Northrop gives neither any reasons for thinking that natural science must neces- sarily imply normative propositions nor an example of deduction of normative prin- ciples from any existing science. He does give some indication that scientists may and indeed sometimes do regard verification of their scientific theories as corroborating also their religious, moral, and political opinions, or, more exactly, that in various periods scientists and philosophers have accepted general philosophical theories which were supposed to be based on the science of the period or to be established by the use of the same method as used in science. Disen- tanglement, however, of science from beliefs and preconceptions associated with it has been one of the features of scientific ad- vance. The thesis which seems most clearly in- volved in Northrop's argument is not the proposition that any descriptive science must have normative implications but rather the supposition that any normative theory must imply propositions about the nature of world and man, and that, conse- quently, such normative theories may be tested by seeing whether or not their im- plied assertions about nature and man can be verified by scientific procedure. It might be conceded that any normative theory does imply descriptive propositions about nature or man; but it is clearly a mistake to con- clude from this supposition that the implied descriptive propositions furnish a test of the normative theory. It may be, as seems to be the case, that sharply contrasted normative theories imply the same propositions about nature or man; or, what amounts to the same thing, a variety of ethical theories may be consistent with scientifically established facts about man and nature. The plausibility of Northrop's argument really depends, however, on an ambiguity. When he is making a careful statement Northrop seems to say not that natural sci- ence furnishes a test for normative theories but rather that the test is furnished by philosophy of science. This may make a crucial difference, since it may be that phi- losophy of science is not science, is not veri- fied in the same way that science is, and in- deed is not descriptive. Northrop says: "Put more explicitly this means that that philosophy of culture, that normative social theory, is the scientifically verified and the correct one in which the basic philosophical primitive ideas and postulates are identical with the primitive ideas and postulates of the philosophy of natural science arrived at by the analysis of the verified theory of nat- ural science which brings out into the open its basic methodological, epistemological and ontological assumptions" (italics mine). Northrop apparently believes that all the assumptions or presuppositions of a specific scientific theory should be placed in a sys- tem of primitive ideas and postulates con- stituting the explicitly formulated theory, that consequences are deduced from this system, and that the entire system is con- firmed or disconfirmed by experimental test of the deduced consequences. Because of</page><page sequence="7">268 ETHICS this belief Northrop seems to hold, at least when he is thinking of how philosophy of science is verified, that philosophy of science is continuous or identical with science. Such placing of the presuppositions of a theory among the postulates of the theory seems logically indefensible. Scientific the- ories presuppose logic and mathematics; but it would not be correct to say that logic and mathematics are parts of specific theories and are verified by the experimental testing of the theories. It seems essential to recog- nize that scientific theories involve presup- positions which are more general than what is confirmed or disconfirmed by the experi- mental tests. Northrop seems to move toward such rec- ognition when he needs "methodological, epistemological and ontological assump- tions" to check with the presuppositions of normative theory; and I believe the plausi- bility of his contention that science and so- cial theory should have the same presuppo- sitions depends on the shift from postulates to presuppositions. If, however, this shift is recognized, then Northrop's argument that normative theories are established by the verification of scientific theories is left float- ing in thin air, without foundation. The point at issue may be clarified by saying that science is both a system of veri- fied theories and also a human activity or enterprise and a social institution. Science as a human enterprise and a social institu- tion presupposes a community of scholars, that is, a group, large or small, of men who are actually, in some sense, reasonable beings and who accept and follow common ideals or norms. The notion of "verified the- ories" can be given meaning only by refer- ence to a community of men committed to principles of honest reporting of experi- ments, fair examination of evidence sub- mitted by others, and cautious determina- tion of opinion on the basis of all relevant evidence. Such principles, however, are not propositions falling within science as a body of knowledge or a system of verified the- ories; no scientific theories can be deduced from them; and they are not tested by the confirmation or disconfirmation of scientific theories. In summary, then, Northrop's contention that normative theories may be tested by their relation to the verified theories of nat- ural science points in exactly the wrong di- rection. He gives no reason at all for sup- posing that verified theories of natural sci- ence imply normative propositions; and the plausibility of his argument depends on a reference, which he does not recognize as such, to certain assumptions of science or of scientists which are not established by ex- perimental procedure. An account of practical judgments which seems to be directly opposed to that of Northrop is presented by Professor A. C. Ewing in The Definition of the Good.2 Ewing does not confront us as does Northrop with a bold hypothesis but offers rather a pro- posal so modest that criticism of it seems quibbling. The substance of his theory can be adequately stated in a few sentences. Ewing rejects ethical skepticism because he finds that he and most other men make ethical judgments which they persist in re- garding as more reasonable than the alterna- tives. He rejects naturalism because it in equivocal fashion devitalizes ethical judg- ments, shifting between reducing them to factual judgments, which are not ethical, and making them definitions, which are not judgments. Having reached this point he ex- amines the meaning of ethical judgments rather than the question as to what their grounds are. He nevertheless in discussing the meaning of ethical judgments seems to say all that he has to say or thinks need be said about how they are established. According to Ewing ethical judgments may be interpreted as asserting that various things are fitting objects of attitudes for or against. To judge, for instance, that any- thing is good is to assert that it is a fitting object for a "pro" (favorable) attitude. This way of interpreting what is asserted in a normative judgment has various advan- tages as a preliminary formulation of the 2 New York: Macmillan, I947. Pp. 2I5. $3.00.</page><page sequence="8">DISCUSSION 269 problem of the grounds of such judgments. It would suggest a systematic analysis of at- titudes and a consideration of whether some or all of them involved or presupposed prin- ciples relevant to the selection of appropri- ate objects. Ewing seems to think, however, that he has solved the problem. His explica- tion of the meaning of normative judgments plus his rejection of ethical skepticism seem to amount to the assertion that some of our attitudes are justified by the nature of their objects. This modest assertion indeed seems reasonable. The substance of Ewing's theory lies, however, not in this modest proposition but in the conviction that nothing more need be said. This conviction involves or posits an extensive theory; but since Ewing is con- vinced that nothing more need be said, the substance of his theory is not explicitly stated or not stated at all. Ewing's belief that he has said all that can be said in general terms about the ground of normative judgments is reflected in several statements. He says: "The reason why something, A, is good, that is, why we ought to adopt these attitudes to A, lies in the natural, factual characteristics of A it- self.... The value judgments which we see to be true are judgments that because of certain natural characteristics which it has. A ought to be chosen, approved or pur- sued." In another place he asserts: "To say it is fitting to approve A is to say that A is of such a nature as to call for our approval. We can only see whether we ought to have a pro attitude towards something by seeing what the nature of that something is, and the right pro attitude is dictated by its na- ture." In meeting an objection to his theory, he says "It will be objected against me that it is only fitting to approve, or have a pro attitude towards, what is good because we first know or believe it to be good and that, if we did not believe it to be good, there would be no ground for such an attitude, so the attitude would not be fitting. The an- swer is that the ground lies not in some other ethical concept, goodness, but in the con- crete, factual characteristics of what we pro- nounce good. Certain characteristics are such that the fitting response to what pos- sesses them is a pro attitude, and that is all there is to it." These statements indicate clearly Ewing's belief that he has specified adequately the grounds of normative judgments. The ground of a normative judgment is the fac- tual characteristics of the object of the judg- ment, and that is all there is to it. Indeed, Ewing seems to have moved strangely close to Northrop, and to be recommending, as Northrop does, that to find a basis for ethi- cal judgments we study the nature of the world and man. Once we find out what the nature of something is, then "the right pro attitude is dictated by its nature." There is, however, an important differ- ence between the two theories. Northrop holds that normative propositions are im- plied by the basic postulates of natural sci- ence. Ewing seems to maintain that norma- tive propositions are established directly by the examination of the factual characteris- tics of specific things. His doctrine at this point, however, is difficult to interpret clearly. Though fittingness is determined by factual characteristics, it is not itself a fac- tual characteristic. "There is obviously a sense in which one could give a complete de- scription of something without saying whether it is good or bad, which fact shows goodness to be something different from an ordinary quality of the thing which is pronounced good.... But the relation in which I hold goodness to consist, that of being a fitting object of a pro attitude, can be seen to follow necessarily from the factual nature of anything that we rightly pro- nounce to be intrinsically good. If something is a fitting object of a pro attitude at all, it could not fail to be so without its factual nature being different from what it is. Yet fittingness is still not itself a part of its fac- tual nature." This statement makes plain that the judgment that something with certain fac- tual characteristics also has the characteris- tic of being fitting is not merely an observa- tion that the thing in question does as a matter of fact have the characteristic of</page><page sequence="9">270 ETHICS being fitting, and Ewing indicates elsewhere that ethical judgments are not reports of sense perception or of introspection. Ethical judgments assert that the characteristic of fittingness follows necessarily from the fac- tual characteristics. He does not, however, identify "follows necessarily" with logical implication. It is clear enough, in any case, that Ewing believes he has said all that need or perhaps can be said about the grounds of ethical judgments. "And if the sceptic demands for judgments in ethics a logical proof as we have in mathematics, or an empirical induc- tive proof as we have in natural science, he is condemning ethics because ethical cogni- tion is not like other kinds of cognition but has its own distinctive nature." Ewing's recommendation, then, is that we examine the factual characteristics of things with the assurance that such examination will show us which attitudes are fitting and indeed necessarily so. One is tempted to dismiss Ewing's doc- trine as an example of the practice which seems not uncommon among British phi- losophers of blandly asserting an impossible position in order to make irrelevant the usual objections to all possible ones. Cer- tainly one is led to admire the effectiveness of British moral training which makes mo- rality so much second nature to a respect- able Englishman that he sees his attitudes and ways as fitting snugly to the nature of things. It is clear enough, however, that in substance Ewing's position corresponds to a very widely accepted doctrine. Though the manner of his argument may be colored by the peculiarities of recent British discussion and though his thorough habituation to fair-mindedness and good sense may lead him to be more optimistic than others about the possibility of actually solving ethical problems, his views as to the proper way of solving such problems are not peculiarly British and are shared indeed by many people who doubt that such problems can, in fact, be solved. Certainly, a great many of the naturalists whom Ewing criticizes, though they would not use such terms as "intuition" and "synthetic a priori judg- ments," and many social scientists, who would probably avoid using such terms as "good" and "right," would agree with Ewing that the proper way to solve practical problems is to examine the facts and then to make a disinterested judgment. Such a view is perhaps generally ac- cepted; and Ewing's version has at least this merit, that it brings into the open and in- deed focuses attention on the difficulties of the view. This is the main reason Ewing's doctrine is preferable to naturalism. There is no substantial difference between Ewing's theory and the usual versions of naturalism. The difference is that while in various nat- uralistic doctrines the difficulties are de- cently hidden, Ewing in a reasonable and candid fashion develops and acknowledges the consequences of his basic position. Such development confirms both Ewing's insist- ence that moral judgments are not empirical generalizations and his suggestion that they must then, on the premises, be deductions from descriptions of the facts. The suggestion, however, that from de- scriptions of facts we can somehow deduce necessary moral theorems clearly seems unacceptable. The obvious conclusion would seem to be that the premise, namely, that ethical judgments are established by a de- scription of the facts, should be abandoned. To put the matter affirmatively, one might say that Ewing's contention, as against the naturalists, that ethical judgments involve ethical predicates is useful, so far as it goes, in keeping the record straight but that it leaves untouched the central fact, namely, that ethical judgments presuppose ethical premises or first principles. Rejection of the premise that ethical judgments are estab- lished by a description of facts would in- volve the affirmative proposition that ethi- cal judgments presuppose and depend on ethical premises or first principles. It would seem to Ewing, however, and to many naturalists, and indeed to most phi- losophers that this proposition would con- stitute, or at least lead directly to, subjec- tivism. Different people, it might be said,</page><page sequence="10">DISCUSSION 271 have different ethical premises, and to say that one cannot by examining the nature of things determine which premises are correct is equivalent to saying that there is no test of correctness and consequently no distinc- tion in terms of correctness between one set of ethical premises and any other set. Such a conclusion would certainly be absurd. One is led to it, however, not by the assumption that ethical judgments presuppose ethical premises but by the quite different assump- tion that there is no way of establishing ethical premises or first principles except by reading them off from the description of the world and man. This assumption is indeed a preconception or unexamined postulate of modern philosophers. Ewing's acceptance of such an assump- tion, together with his conviction that nat- uralism and subjectivism are untenable, would account for his conclusion that ethical judgments must be based directly on a de- scription of their objects, since there seems no remaining alternative. If, however, it is true, as I have insisted, that description of the facts about nature and man does not, in the absence of ethical or normative prem- ises, provide a basis for ethical judgments, it would seem to follow that any ethical judg- ments that Ewing does make are without adequate foundation and are, indeed, reflec- tions of his cultural background and training rather than judgments in any proper sense. Such a view is evidently much too simple. Ewing is an intelligent man, and he has ex- amined contemporary problems carefully, critically, and with considerable insight. Some consideration of the grounds Ewing actually finds for moral judgments may throw light both on the unstated premises of his ethical theory and on the general prob- lem of how ethical premises may be found or established. In The Individual, the State, and World Government3 Ewing undertakes to reach reasoned conclusions about a number of contemporary moral problems. The main conclusions of the book are that human rights are justified by their consequences in 3 New York: Macmillan, I947. Pp. viii+322. $4.00. terms of the good of everyone concerned; that democracy is justified by the probabil- ity that there is no alternative which would work as well; that there are no absolute obli- gations to the state-political obligations, indeed, like rights and other obligations being properly based on a consideration of the general good of everyone; and, finally, that it would be desirable "to apply con- sistently to states those ethical principles which are generally recognized as applying to individuals," and that such application would involve some form of world govern- ment. Examination (which cannot be docu- mented in any limited space) of Ewing's rea- soning indicates that his ethical judgments are indeed based in part on a consideration of the nature of their objects. There is, how- ever, a crucial ambiguity in the meaning which might be given the term "object." The objects and the factual considerations which enter into Ewing's discussion are com- mon-sense objects and facts, such as "per- sons," "governments," "laws," "promises," etc. They belong, that is, to the anthro- pomorphized world whose objects are deter- mined in relation to hum'tn actions. Such ob- jects do contain practical principles and lend themselves to moral discourse. They are terms in a universe of discourse which is cor- related with action or practice and which is structured or analyzed by practical prin- ciples and distinctions. The objects and facts described in science and the terms used to specify and describe them belong, so to speak, in another uni- verse of discourse whose objects have been so far as possible de-anthropomorphized and purified of any admixture of interest or pur- pose. If science furnishes the model or ideal for description of the world and man, then Ewing's moral judgments are not based on a description of natural objects. Ewing's discussion moves, as indeed it should, within the realm of common sense, which is full of moralized objects and laced with practical distinctions. He might simply have accepted and used in his discussion the practical principles generally admitted with-</page><page sequence="11">272 ETHICS out question in his culture, moving upward in case of conflicting principles to more gen- eral principles, and clarifying principles in case of ambiguity, but guiding himself throughout by the intention of expressing the moral consciousness of his country and his time. I am convinced that if he had done this his conclusions would have been more reasonable than they actually are, since dis- cussion of political and moral issues in Eng- land over the centuries has made notable progress toward practical wisdom. Common sense is, nevertheless, every- where a mixture of practical wisdom, local prejudice, and obsolete tradition; and it is understandable that Ewing should want to be critical. Moreover, he was worried by naturalism and subjectivism, and had a commendable desire to halt their undermin- ing of morality. Consequently, Ewing does not merely base his judgments upon com- mon-sense beliefs; he applies a process of criticism which leads him counter to many conventional opinions. It seems apparent that while common- sense objects do furnish a basis for common- sense moral judgments, critical moral judg- ments cannot be read off from the nature of such objects. Ewing must have and indeed he does have a principle of criticism. Though this principle is not explicitly stated, it is sufficiently close to the surface for its shape to be clearly seen. As a first approximation, we might say that the principle is something like this: any moral opinion for which no adequate reasons can be given should be discarded. For instance, Ewing says in re- gard to an alleged obligation to the state: Now it is certainly not unreasonable to ask further questions as to the basis of this duty, since the mere fact that my parents belong to a certain social organisation, possibly against and probably without their choice, or that I have been born in territory controlled by that organization, can hardly of itself give rise a priori to any ethical duty to serve the or- ganisation in question. Since such criticism would depend, of course, on some specification of what consti- tutes an adequate reason, it is evident that the principle involves more than I have so far indicated. This additional component, I think, is that reasons are inadequate if they cannot be universalized. Or, to put the mat- ter another way, the test of a moral judg- ment is whether or not it conforms to the requirements which define objectivity for any judgment. This principle is certainly not explicitly stated as basic to Ewing's theory; but it seems to be the pillar upon which the more superficial layers of his argument depend. The first layer is what is evident-for ex- ample, that "the ethical claim of the state to an absolute and exclusive allegiance is also rendered ridiculous by the contingent and arbitrary nature of national bound- aries." The second layer, or at least one that is frequently reached, is constituted of argu- ments to the general good. For instance, "It may rationally be contended that, if a par- ticular act in service of our own country is for the greatest good of humanity, then it ought to be done in any case, even if we were under no special obligation to our country, but that if it is not for the greatest good of humanity it is wrong even if it is for the greatest good of our country, since we have no right to sacrifice the greater good of hu- manity to the good of our country any more than to the good of our friends or of our- selves." Ewing, however, does not suggest that consideration of the greatest good of hu- manity is the ultimate basis for ethical judg- ments. He points out, on the contrary, that his theory has the merit of freeing ethical judgments from estimates of quantities of good, and that while "it is hard to believe that it could ever be a duty deliberately to produce less good when we could produce more," nevertheless, "if the analysis I have given were adopted, . . . to say that we ought to produce the greatest good in our power would then only be to say that we ought to act in the way which was pre- ferable above all others." In other words, since good is defined as fittingness for a pro attitude, fittingness for a pro attitude could</page><page sequence="12">DISCUSSION 273 not be determined by an estimate of good- ness. Underneath the references to the greatest good of humanity there lies, so far as I can determine, the assumption that if an ethical judgment is objective, the reasons for it must be cogent for any rational being, and that consequently such reasons cannot in- clude the interests, peculiarities, or acci- dental circumstances of the actors involved. This supposed consequence, which is not ex- plicitly stated, seems to be used at crucial points in the argument. It is true that in one place Ewing ex- plicitly distinguishes between the basic as- sumption and the supposed consequence, and restricts himself to a weak form of the supposed consequence. He says: "(i) If it is fitting for somebody to have a pro atti- tude toward a, the judgement that it is thus fitting for him will be true, whoever makes it, whether man, Martian, angel or God. (2) If it is fitting for any being to have a pro attitude towards a as such in a given respect, it will be fitting for any other being who knows what a is factually like also to have a pro attitude." In the discussion, however, a much stronger supposition about the requirements of objectivity seems to be used. Ewing says, for instance: "The individual, as I have al- ready pointed out, has no doubt an absolute and universal right to equal consideration; that is, his good must be treated as no less important than the equally important good of any other individual, but this purely for- mal right will not carry us very far, and it may even be doubted whether to assert it is more than to utter a tautology." Unless I am badly mistaken, however, such propositions, or interpretations of them which are not tautological, are in fact used in the argument to carry Ewing and the reader considerable distances. Ewing's fre- quent appeals to the general good seem to depend on some such reasoning as the fol- lowing: aiming at the good of an individual or at the good of a group less than the whole could be justified only by references to fac- tors which would not be compelling for ev- eryone, and consequently only an aim at the good of all humanity is justified by reasons which should be cogent for everyone. Perhaps I have distributed Ewing's argu- ment wrongly between the use of a critical principle and the mere acceptance of com- mon-sense doctrines; but in any case the only critical principle I can find is primarily negative and rests finally on assumptions about the formal requirements for objec- tivity in judgment of any kind. Waiving the point that no specific judg- ments can be derived from the form of ob- jectivity, I wish to suggest that an analysis which uses an unjustified analogy between descriptive and ethical judgments may have disastrous theoretical consequences. Ethical judgments concern actions, actions involve actors or agents, and agents, whether indi- viduals or groups, act by virtue of a complex of ideals, habits, interests, and commit- ments which is largely the result of historical accident and contingent circumstance. The fact that an ethical judgment should be based on adequate reasons gives us no guid- ance whatsoever in determining just what, in this complex of contingent peculiarities of the agent, is relevant to an ethical judgment. Consequently, the assumption that it does furnish adequate guidance may lead to an arbitrary and capricious weighting of the individual, historical, and institutional fac- tors in action. For instance, Ewing, in discussing nation- alism, asserts, '@Nobody can give any objec- tive characteristic which the Poles, the French, or the members of any nation have in common and do not share with many members of other nations, and which ex- plains why it is desirable that they should form one state." Whatever may be a reason- able judgment about nationalism, it seems evident that a man who asked for a divorce on the ground that he had discovered that his wife had no objective characteristics not possessed by other women would be sus- pected of having overlooked some relevant factors. Ewing, it is true, says that the fact that people have a certain sentiment should be taken into account; but to classify all the</page><page sequence="13">274 ETHICS relations which bind men together into so- cial groups as arbitrary sentiments, whose pulls must be taken into account but which are not as reasons relevant to moral or po- litical judgments, is to beg many of the fundamental questions of ethics and politics. My conclusion is that Ewing's practical judgments depend in part on an unacknowl- edged and unexamined acceptance of com- mon sense and in part on the application of a critical principle which is not explicitly stated. Since the principle is not directed systematically to a critical reconstruction of common sense and is in any case inadequate for such use, the result of its application is a capricious modification of common-sense morality. In so far as Ewing finds that the nature of objects dictates appropriate attitudes or practical judgments, he is utilizing moral- ized objects from the common-sense uni- verse of practice. Since, however, he thinks he is looking directly at the nature of things, he by-passes the crucial problem, which is the critical analysis of such universe of dis- course. When he finds, as he frequently does, that common-sense moral attitudes are not justified by the nature of their objects, he is not, as he thinks, uncovering the real nature of such objects but is disintegrating the ob- jects and their connections with actions and attitudes by a principle of criticism which, if applied explicitly and ruthlessly, would dis- solve the universe of discourse in which prac- tical judgments occur. The moral of this lengthy criticism of our two authors is that practical principles can be established only by an examination and analysis of the subject matter or field in which such principles function. This field is constituted of agents, their activities, and the materials and products of such activi- ties, of persons, societies, institutions, and the various components of culture. The field of practice is of course given, and it is neither removed nor replaced by science. Science as a body of knowledge is dependent on scientists, that is, persons with certain ideals and principles of action. Science is dependent on a community of sci- entists, a community whose members ac- knowledge certain rights, obligations and norms in their dealings with each other. Science is not, however, the only cultural product; the exchange of scientific reports is not the only kind of social activity; and the ideals of science are not the only basis for community or society. Though the field of practice is given, its basic principles are not evident. The field of practice is more or less coincident with com- mon sense; but common sense, of course, is always the common sense of a time and a place, shot through with superstition, prej- udice, and irrational customs. Normative principles lie, however, somewhere behind or beneath common sense; and we move to- ward them in so far as we disentangle from the local and the temporary the principles which are presupposed by any rational ac- tion, or by any activity of a certain type, or by any society, or by all societies of a certain kind.
