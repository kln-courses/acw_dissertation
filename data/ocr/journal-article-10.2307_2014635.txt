<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXI., No. 26 DECEMBER 18, 1924 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE IMMEDIATE APPREHENSION OF GOD ACCORDING TO WILLIAM JAMES AND WILLIAM E. HOCKING1 T HE influence of mystical trance upon philosophical systems would make one of the most curious chapters of the history of philosophy. Let us hope that some competent person will soon write that chapter. As for us, after brief remarks upon the Neo- Platonic philosopher, Plotinus, we shall do no more than examine with some care the teachings of two modern representatives of the mystical tradition, William James and William Hocking. When one believes with the mystics that God, the Absolute, the Ultimate Reality-in this connection these terms and others are used interchangeably-is directly experienced in ecstatic trance and nowhere else, it would seem to follow that knowledge of the trance- consciousness includes a knowledge of God. The problem of the nature of the divine Power or Powers was hardly formulated in the mind of the uncivilized mystic. He was engrossed in enjoying and using his trances. He merely affirmed its transcendental significance, he did not speculate about it. But it was otherwise at the beginning of the Christian era among the possessors of Greek culture. There the problem of the nature of God had been definitely formulated and was eagerly discussed. The Nea-Platonists, Plotinus in particular, took up certain strands of Hellenic thought, woven, perhaps, partially and indirectly from Hindoo mystical metaphysics 2 (itself dependent upon the much older and cruder tradition of the uncivilized regarding ecstatic trance), and spun wonderful theories. That the mystical theories of Plotinlus (born 205 A.D.,) had one of their roots in ecstasy, appears with satisfactory clearness in his writings, and nowhere better than in this passage from the En'eads: "Now often I am roused from the body to my true self and behold a marvellous beauty, and am particularly persuaded at the time that I belong to a better sphere, and live a supremely good life, 'and become identical with the godhead, and fast fixed therein attain its 1 This paper is part of a chapter on "Religion, Science, and Philosophy" in a book soon to be published on the Psychology of Beligiows Mystioismn. 2 An excellent brief exposition of the mystical metaphysics of the Upanishads may be found in Josiah Royce's Oifford Lectures, The World and the Individual, Vol. II Fourth Lecture, pp. 165-75. 701</page><page sequence="2">702 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY divine activity, having reached a plane above the whole intelligible realm." "Now since in the vision they were not two, but the seer was made one with the seen, not as with something seen, but as with something made one with himself, he who has been united with it might, if he remember, have by him some faint image of the divine. He himself was one (in the vision), with no distinctions within him- self either as regarded himself or outer things. There was no move- ment of any sort in him, nor was emotion or desire of any outer thing present in him after his ascent, no, not any reason or any thought, nor was he himself present to himself, if I may so express it." 3 The theory that in ecstasy the self becomes "identical with the godhead and attains its divine activity" offers a special difficulty; for ecstatic trance is not a simple experience, uniform as long as it lasts. It consists, on the contrary, in a succession of mental states which grow more and more simple and end in total unconsciousness. At which one of these stages is the deification complete? If at the final stage, the description of the Divine would be brief indeed, since that stage is characterized by complete unconsciousness. The practical Christian mystics, however, firmly anchored in the beliefs in Christ as Son of God, and in a personal and more or less anthropomorphic Father, can not possibly make God equal to unconsciousness. They select among the various and successive aspects of ecstasy those which are not too far removed from the traditional Christian conception. The phases of the trance in which ravishing love or peace and trust, in complete surrender to the Will of God, dominate are those which they regard as divine. We recall also that a condition of automatic activity, referred to Christ or God as the cause, is spoken of by some of the great Christian mystics as deification. As to Plotinus, if he was not embarrassed by an anthropomorphie conception of God, he was influenced by other preconceptions, those familiar to the philosophers of his time. Hindoo as well as Greek philosophy regarded God as infinite, i.e., as in no way limited or conditioned. Therefore nothing could be predicated of him, for the possession of specific qualities would be a limitation of his infinite nature. Under the influence of considerations of that type, uncom- promisingly logical minds might identify the Absolute with the final phase of ecstasy of which, as a matter of fact, only negations can be affirmed. That is what the philosophers of the Upanishads did. Certain German mystics, in particular Boehme and Eckhart, have yielded to the same temptation: "Alles Endliche ist ein Abfall vom s Charles Bakewell, Source Book in Ancient Philosophy, New York, Seribner 's Sons, 1907, pp. 386, 391-2.</page><page sequence="3">TIHE IMMEDIATE APPREHENSION OF GOD 703 Wesen. Im Wesen giebt es keinen Gegensatz, nicht Lieb, noch Leid, nicht Weiss noch Schwarz," said Eckhart. In this view, not even being or essence can be affirmed of the Absolute: "Nichts werdenl ist Gott werden. " If these Hindoo and German philosophers followed logic into a black hole, Plotinus was somewhat less radical. The delightful aspects of ecstasy, which are responsible for the warm, humane elements in the divine picture drawn by less intellectual mystics, were not without influence upon him. He noted the marvellous beauty of his visions and believed that he was "living a supremely good life." He seemed to have identified God with a lingering consciousness of selfhood and with indescribable, yet desirable, feelings characteristic of an advanced stage of ecstatic trance. However that may be, the non-civilized and the practical Christians, under the influence of popular preconceptions, identify God with a penultimate stage of ecstasy, while radical philosophers, slaves to logic, make him one with the ultimate phase, i.e., with complete unconsciousness. This means that for the former, not unity or simplicity, not the disappearance of individuality, of differences and divergences, but a plenitude of felt-life, a wonderful impression of free-power, realized in a variety of illusions and hallu- cinations, are the aspects of ecstasy which make it divine. We wish to draw especial attention to the convergence upon the conception of the Divine of what is by many regardecd as two *co-ordinate sources of knowledge; on the one hand, discursive think- ing; on the other, the trance-experience, a source of "immediate knowledge,"-knowledge independent of fallible mental processes. Some speak as if reason recognized in a phase of ecstatic trance the Divine, whose nature it had previously determined. Others speak as if the ecstatic experience revealed the nature of God, while the role of reason remained a subordinate one. What we are to think of this mystical "source of knowledge" will appear in the sequel. WTilliam James and Mystical Ecstasy.-In a book in which reli- gious life is searched for facts that would support his pluralistic philosophy and provide a basis for a religious belief, William James sets down these three propositions: "Mystical states, when they are well developed, usually are, and have a right to be, absolutely authoritative over the individuals to whom they come. "No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically. 4 A. Lasson, Meister Eckhart, der Mystiker, Berlin, 1868.</page><page sequence="4">704 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY "They break down the authority of the non-mystical or rational- istic consciousness, based upon the understanding and the senses alone. They show it to be only one kind of consciousness. They open out the possibility of other orders of truth in which, so far as anything in us vitally responds to them, we may freely continued to have faith. " - The mystic 's revelation is, we are told, invulnerable because, even though his senises are in abeyance, his experience is as truly a di- rect perception of fact as any sensation ever is.6 He is in possession of "immediate" or "intuitive" knowledge, therefore of unassailable knowledge, since it is given and not secured by mental operations always open to error. We agree with William James that whatever is "immediate," "pure experience, " whatever has not been mentally elaborated, is invulnerable. There is here no room for difference of opinion. Disagreements may appear, however, over the problem of what is to be regarded in experience as "immediate." In our opinion William James has erred, not in considering "pure" experience as unassailable, but in unwittingly regarding as such more than the "given." He has confused pure experience with elaborations of it. It is because of that error that he was a believer in mysticism; or, one should perhaps say that he committed that error because he wished to believe in a mystical revelation. But for what in mystical experience does James claim invulnerability? The uncritical mystic believes that Christ, or the Virgin, or some saint, has manifested himself to him. Although these and similar experiences have at times, for the recipient, a " sensational " quality as compelling as that of true perception, James regards them as illusory because, when critically examined, when confronted with the rest of experience, they do not stand the test. They hold, however, he affirms, a kernel immediately given, intuitional, and, therefore, invulnerable. What is this kernel? He answers that it consists in a feeling or conviction of vastness, of reconciliation, of repose, of safety, of union, of harmony.7 In these terms, and in no others more explicit, does our distinguished philosopher define the kernel of unassailable truth revealed in mystical ecstasy. It is more than the Nothingness extolled by the 5 The Varieties of Religious Experience, pp. 422-3. 6 Ibid., pp. 423-4. 7 ' ' The keynote of it is, invariably, a reconciliation. " Ibid., p. 388. The mystical states "tell of the supremacy of the ideal, of vastness, of union, of safety, and of rest." Ibid., p. 428. Elsewhere he is much less definite, as when he writes that mystical ecstasy reveals "sta.tes of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. There are illuminations, revelations full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain." ibid., p. 380.</page><page sequence="5">THE IMMEDIATE APPREHENSION OF GOD 705 Neo-Platonists. It bears closer affinity to positive happiness and intimates that there is ground for radical optimism. It should not be forgotten that these alleged "truths" are revealed not only to a few lofty religious souls. Any and everybody may enjoy them. Nitrous oxide "stimulates the mystical conscious- ness in an extraordinary degree"; and alcohol "brings its votary from the chill periphery of things to the radiant core. It makes him for the moment one with truth." 8 Here James is certainly in accord with the facts as our investigation of drug-ecstasy has re- vealed them. However it may be produced, ecstasy is ecstasy, just as fever is fever whatever its cause. The truth-kernel of religious ecstasy is, as we have shown, no other than the truth-kernel of narcotic intoxication and ecstatic trance in general. There is, moreover, no doubt that the words quoted-reconcilia- tion, repose, safety, union, harmony-describe the more general, fundamental impressions which come to most mystics. But it ap- pears to us evident that everyone of these words implies an inter- terpretatiorn of "neutral stuff." Their meaning involves, as all meaning does, a relating of two terms. If, for instance, "reconcilia- tion " and " union " have any meaning at all, it is that of the establishment or recognition of a specific relation between two or more terms. Now, unification may be attained in two ways: (1) An understanding of the two terms may be achieved which shows them to be subsumed under a general principle or included in a larger whole. That is the kind of harmony produced by the under- standing. (2) The terms may lose their individual features and be degraded to a level of undifferentiated simplicity. That, as we have seen, is the mystical way of producing "harmony" or "unity." It is a way which does not secure any knowledge. If by "union" James had merely meant to indicate that, as the trance progresses, the mystic notices the gradual disappearance of boundary lines between objects, the merging of ideas into one an- other, the fusion of feelings, and that he enjoys a delightful sense of peace, no objection could have been raised against the claim of unassailability. But it would have been an insignificant claim. What James means is that the mystical experience points to, or signifies, a union of the individual with some one or something else. Now, that is just as much an interpretation of immediate experience as the affirmation of the Salvation Army lassie that she has met Christ face to face. Before it can be accepted as true the alleged "immediate" experience in both instances must be tested according to the canons of scientific evidence, for the "perceptual" quality of the experience no more justifies the mystic in placing credence in it 8 Loc. cit., p. 387.</page><page sequence="6">706 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY than the absence of certain organic sensations authorizes the asylum patient to believe that the doctors have removed his viscera. In a letter published in part in Letters of William James, one reads: "The intellect is interpretative and critical of its own inter- pretation, but there must have been a thesis to interpret, and that thesis seems to me to be the non-rational sense of a 'higher' power." And, further on: "May not this mystical testimony that there is a God be true, even though the precise determination, being so largely 'suggestive' contributionis of outr rational factor, should widely differ. " 9 In this passage, the error which I have tried to lay bare is again clearly apparent. The thought of a "higher, power" is not an "inimediate" datum of consciousness. It is already a product of elaboration and interpretation; it involves, in particular, judgments of relative "height" or value of powers. It is, therefore, no more entitled to claim invulnerability than any of the other grosser and more obvious interpretations of the ordinary mystic. The wide-awake, rational consciousness finds no difficulty in un- derstanding why the "kernel" of the mystical experience is describ- able as reconciliation, union, peace, rest, and the like. Are these not the very terms which would come to the mind of a person who had undergone the mental simplification characteristic of ecstatic trance? Would a person from whose consciousness the external world had disappeared, whose mental activity had been reduced to a vague general idea of the presence of a traditional God, whose affective life was on the point of peaceably dying out-would such a person describe his condition as one of internal strife, would he be impressed by the irreconcilable multiplicity of the elements of experience? Of course not. He would be able to find no better terms than those actually used by the mystics, and, generally, by those familiar with certain aspects of trance-consciousness. Why, then, ascribe a metaphysical significance to that description? Whatever contribution to knowledge may come from that aspect of trance- experience must proceed from the critical activity of the fully-awake mind working upon the whole range of human experience. We are thus led to affirm that if James foutnd it possible to say that "as a matter of fact and in point of logic" the claim of the mystic (reduced to the minimum we have been discussing) "escapes our jurisdiction," it is, it seems, because he confused more or less automatic or habitual causal interpretations of sense-data with the sense-data themselves. The "universality" of the mystical conviction is frequently 0 From a letter to the writer.

But the truth of a belief is not proved by the fact that it is shared: by all known men. Moreover, this conviction is, as a matter of fact, very far from common to all those who have experienced trances possessing the traits singled out by James as characteristic of mystical ecstasy (ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity). Most of the users of narcotics and many of the subjects of spontaneous trance regard its contents, just as they do their dream, i.e., as having no other than a subjective validity. The development of the philosophers' belief in mystical revelation seems to announce the disappearance of the belief. At the beginning, ecstatic trance was held to reveal extensive "truths," concrete as well as abstract, for instance, the will of God at a particular juncture of events. With William James, the revelation had become limited to a sense of safety, of unity, and of harmony. With William Hock- ing it is attenuated still further and becomes a mere "That" of which nothing more can be said. William E. Hocking and Religious Mysticism.-In the English language it is William Hocking who, since James, has most compre- hensively and richly dealt with the philosophical problems of religious mysticism.10 He is generally regarded as a champion of mysticism. Yet a careful examination of his latest utterances may leave one in doubt as to his present position. He complains that certain "imme- diate" qualities of the trance experience have unjustifiably been ascribed to God: "What I want to point out, is that these words, unitary, immediate, ineffable, which at all events apply to the mystic's experience, are precisely the words which the metaphysician applies to the mystic's doctrine. And I suggest that the misinter- pretation of mysticism here in question is due to the fact that what is a psychological report (and a true one) is taken as a metaphysical statement (and a false one). From the fact that one's experience of God has been 'one, immediate, and ineffable,' it does not follow that God Himself is merely 'one, immediate and ineffable'-and so a Being wholly removed from all concrete reality. It is true that this inference from the nature of the experience to the nature of its object is here of the closest order; and it is also true that many a mystic has committed himself to that inference. But it is possible, 10 The Meaning of God in Hwman Experience, Yale University Press, 1912. " The Meaning of Mysticism as seen through its Psychology, " Mind, N. S., XXI, 1912, pp. 38-61.

As Professor Hocking 's most recent utterances on this topic are contained in these last two papers, our exposition and criticism will be based mainly upon them.</page><page sequence="8">708 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and necessary, to respect it." -1 "An 'immediacy' does not legislate about what is beyond itself either to deny it or to affirm it."2 12 sI judge, then, . . . that the marks commonly attributed to the mystic absolute are in the first place so many contributions to mystic psychology. "13 These passages mean that what is regarded by others (James among them) as an immediately given and invulnerable revelation of the nature of God, is really an inference and, therefore, authorita- tive only in so far as reason can make it so. For him the only unquestianable content of the trance is a "Something," a "That," about which nothing more can be said. Any knowledge whatsoever about it is the fruit of rational thought; knowledge of God is not a revelation or an intuition, it is the product of intellectual activity. If the foregoing statements completely represent Hocking's position correctly, he repudiates mysticism and agrees with us. For we have held that, unwittingly, the savage infers identify of the Divine with the plenitude of delight, power, and freedom that comes to him in the earlier phases of the drug ecstasy; that, unwittingly, the Neo- Platonic philosopher infers identity of the Absolute with the ultimate period of the trance, and that James and others do likewise with certain feelings and attitudes prominent in a phase of that experience. James and the mystics in general (including Bergson) have erred, according to Hocking, in placing mystical knowledge-intuition or the immediately given-in hostile opposition to conceptual knowledge. The relation is another one: " Intuition must be regarded not as a station, but as a point through which true knowl- edge must pass, . . . as a mode of cognition by which conceptual knowledge is not so much excluded as concentrated." '4 "Imme- diacy and idea are not disparate stuff; they are different stages of the same stuff, the same meaning. " 1'5 Both intuition and interpreta- tion are necessary in order to attain truth. Intuition alone is empty. "With these two methods, the way is open for a hopeful resumption of metaphysical effort." 16 When you have said, as Professor Hocking does, that the "That" of mystical ecstasy has no meaning until interpreted, that it is mind- "1 Mind, Ioc. cit., p. 43. 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid, p. 44. 14 Rev. de MJta. et de Morale, loc. cit., p. 447. 15 Mind, Ioc. cit., p. 44. 16 Rev. de M6ta. et de Morale, loc. cit., p. 451. In his metaphysical search Professor Hocking it moved by a desire to establish the existence of a God conceived so as to fulfil human needs and aspira- tions, and he is of the opinion that metaphysics leads to such a God and not merely to the empty Absolute of Plotinus.</page><page sequence="9">THE IMMEDIATE APPREHENSION OF GOD 709 stuff or "neutral-stuff," out of which in an active m'ind knowledge issues, logic compels you, it seems, to hold that the same is true of all the "thats" immediately given in any other experience. The imme- diately-given in ecstasy is no longer isolated as a unique phenomenon; it is now properly classified together with the meaningless and yet potentially meaningful Something which is at the root of every psychical experience whatsoever. For, not only in mystical ecstasy, but also in every perceptual and affective experience, something unassailable and ineffable is given. Thus, the metaphysical effort to find God is provided with a much broader intuitive basis than that of mystical ecstasy alone; its basis includes the "given" in conscious experience generally. In the search for God no position of vantage may now be claimed a priori for the immediately given in trance experience. To draw the above corollary of the propositions laid down by Professor Hocking regarding the mystical revelation is equivalent to a renunciation of the essential mystical position. But Professor Hocking does not draw that corollary, he does not renounce mysti- cism; for, notwithstanding the passages we have quoted, he holds that the mystical experience reveals God directly, authoritatively. Other- wise, what is the meaning of these utterances: "'The mystic knows the Truth, so he assures us: but he seems to spin hopelessly about this point, and to come forward very slowly with any statement of its contents. May it be that the mystic is more sure that he is sure than of what he is sure-except that he is sure of God and of his own rela- tion to God ? 17 "Let the mystic, then, be certain of his 'the truth,' his 'God's truth,' and do not enviously require him at every turn to say what the truth contains. "18 "The mystic gives us the thing which is to be modified. . .. But who else could have pulled down from heaven that substance?" 19 17 God in Human Experience, p. 454. 1 bid., p. 455. 19 God in Human Experience, p. 460. In order to do full justice to Professor Hocking's argument for mysticism, it would be necessary to give an adequate abstract of several chapters of his book. The following quotations, although mere disjointed fragments, may stimulate the reader's curiosity. "It may be that the more we press the conclusions of our position, the less we shall be able to recognise in any concrete characters of our own ex- perience, the experience here described. We have made all social experienee depend upon a conscious knowledge in experience of a being, who in scope and power might well be identified with God. We have been led by the successive requirements of logic to the position that our first and fundamental social experience is an experience of God" (295). "God is known as that of which I am primarily certain; and being certain, am certain of self and of my world of men and men 's objects. I shall</page><page sequence="10">710 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It seems after all that Hocking holds, with James and the mystic philosophers in general, that the immediate in ecstasy does not remain meaningless until rationally interpreted; it is not on a level with the immediate in conscious experience in general, for it conveys a direct and truthful assurance of God and of the mystic's own relation to Him; it is a divine substance known intuitively to come "from heaven." That first, immediate, apprehension does not, it is true, lay hold on all the knowledge about God which we might like to have, but it suffices to lift man up above fatal doubt and disbelief. Further knowledge must wait upon intellectual labor. If we reject the mystical claim, even when it is limited as by Hocking, it is because the passage from sensations and feelings, whatever they may be, to the thought of "God," however under- stood, seems to us always an elaboration of the "given." To think of God-any kind of god-on the occasion of a sensory or affective experience, however unusual in intensity or quality, is to ascribe a cause to an intuitive, immediate experience. The confusion of this automatic assignment of a cause with immediate, intuitive, experience reveals how deeply ingrained is the habit -of assigning causes. It begins to be formed at birth and soon becomes mechanical. When the uncivilized hears God in the thunder, he is subject to the same illusion of immediacy as is the Christian who feels God in an influx of moral energy when in ecstasy or ordinary prayer. We have elsewhere examined experiences regarded by uncivilized always be more certain that God is, than what he is: it is the age-long problem of religion to bring to light the deeper characters of this fundamental experi- ence. But the starting point of this development (which we shall have occasion to trace in some rough way) is no mere That Which, without predicates. Substance is known as Subject: reality from the beginning is known as God. The idea of God is not an attribute which in the course of experience I come to attach to my original whole idea: the unity of my world which makes it from the beginning a whole, knowable in simplicity, is the unity of other Self-hood. "'God then is immediately known, and permanently known, as the Other Mind which in creating Nature is also creating me. Of this knowledge nothing can despoil us; this knowledge has never been wanting to the self-knowing mind of man" (296-7). "In applying the name, of God to the Other Mind which in sustaining physical experience does continually create and communicate itself to us, we have gone indeed beyond our warrant. We have what must justify the animism of our ancestors-the inevitable animism of all mankind" (300). "'Man knows well that he is not alone; he does not so well know in what companionship he is. The knowledge of the presence of spirit beyond self is no conjecture; nor does this social experience ever arise. Man's world is from the first a living world, even a divine world; and primitive animism is in so far no mere theory, but a report of certain and intimate experience" (317).

They were sub- mitted to a critical analysis, and recently acquired scientific knowl- edge of the psycho-physiological effects of certain ecstasy-producing drugs was brought to bear upon them. It appeared that the early mystics owe their belief mainly to delightful impressions of limitless power and freedom, to altered self-feelings, to the impression that the soul is liberated from the body, to automatisms including wonder- ful sensory hallucinations. Now, every one of these impressions and beliefs can be satisfactorily explained as the result of psycho- physiological forces set in activity or inhibited by the drug. We then examined the mystical ecstasies of the Yogin and of a group of Christian mystics. Their own descriptions were compared with non-religious ecstasies-those of poets, of epileptics, of ordinary nor- mal persons. In all these ecstasies, the same fundamental characteristics were discovered, and we came to the conclusion that there need be no differences between religious and non-religious ecstasies other than those due to a different interpretation-the interpretation being itself the cause of important affective and volitional phenomena. Particular attention was given to the impressions of ineffability and of illumination or revelation; for they, perhaps more than any other feature, are responsible for the persistency of the belief in the divineness of ecstasy. Both these traits are frequent in trance- whether it be produced spontaneously or by drugs such as ether and nitrous oxide. They occur also in near-sleep conditions arising naturally. Any narrowing of consciousness or any dissociation of mental connections, whatever the cause, may be accompanied by these strange impressions. We have offered a psychological explanation of the impression of illumination which to us appears sufficient. Other features of the mystical trance to which philosophers have ascribed much evidential value (unity, harmony, and the sense of security which goes with them) have also received in the preceding pages an explanation which should relieve one of any inclination to appeal to a divine illumination; they are unavoidable products of the psychological condition in which an entranced person finds himself. Thus, our comparative investigation of trance-states with their impression of unlimited power and of passivity, their excitement and quietude, their hallucinations and exclusion of the world of sense, their absolute certitude and moments of doubt, their harmony and ineffa-bility, led us to the conclusion that mystical trance contains nothing, no "sign," no "thesis," no "That," demanding, from the informed and reflective mind, belief in divine revelation-unless, however, one should take the term "divine" as designating merely the general ground of conscious life; or unless one should conceive</page><page sequence="12">712 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of "God" as manifesting himself in those ways of physical and psy- chical nature of which the scientists find the laws. Shottld one do so, then every part and aspect of conscious life would, as well as the mystical ecstatic-trance itself, be an expression of the Divine. But if the regular, law-bound nature known to science should be called the "Divine," then the essential claim of mysticism would be given up. In seeking intercourse with God in the disappearance of diversity, in the peace of utter surrender, in excruciating delights, in a sense of freedom and illumination, the mystics have followed a wrong way. These experiences reveal the Christian God no more than does the "given" in the rest of conscious experience. The mystical experi- ence points to the same conclusions as conscious life in general. One might speculate and suppose that when the higher mental life and the activity of the external senses have ceased, the quality of primordial organic sensations and feelings is revealed. On the brink of unconsciousness-whether it be the unconsciousness of sleep or of abnormal trance produced in any way whatsoever-conscious- ness is at its simplest; it is continuity without parts, and, therefore, let us say, eternal and timeless. This might be spoken of as the Urgrund, to use a term of the German pantheistic mystics, and it might be surmised that it is in this form that consciousness began in the organic world. Thus far one might speculate. But what an incredible confusion it would be to regard the Urgrund, so disclosed at the vanishing point of consciousness, as a revelation of the nature of the Perfect God made flesh in Jesus Christ and worshipped in the churches!
