<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES II. Holistic Theories* These theories, as we pointed out in the introduction, are op posed to the atomistic conception which reduces a living body morphologically to an aggregate of cells and physiologically to a sum of partial functions; on the contrary they advance a synthetic or organized view in biology, which takes into account the unity of forms or types as life reveals them ; in other words they consider an organism as a whole or a unity. They emphasize the domination of the whole over the composing parts: this they call the domination of the form, because the various tissues cooperate mutually and harmoniously to build up the individual's own typical form. Now among the upholders of the holistic view, some do not go any further than to prove and recognize the organized wholeness as an empirical hypothesis. They provide us with all the empirical data, they show experimentally that the different parts of a living body are not autonomous but interdependent, and on the basis of these facts they advance the organismal theory, namely, that the organism is and works as a whole. The theory as such is purely scientific, and its defenders do not attempt to make any philosophical implications; when they speak of form the term is taken only in a phenomenistic sense; at the most they point out that the facts would require something in the organ ism that differentiated it from inorganic matter. We might, there fore, call this view empirical holism. From among the many em pirical holists we quote J. Bolke,43 A. Suffer,44 Whitman,45 E. B. Wilson,46 W. E. Ritter,47 L. W. Sharp, R. Jaretzky,48 Nierstrasz, J. F. van Beummelen, F. R. Lillie, etc.49 ♦The first part of this paper appeared in the previous number. 43.

These biologists simply state the unity of the living bodies, but refuse to answer the question, how this unity ultimately is to be explained. Such a scientific attitude is of course perfectly justified. Many other holists, however, proceed beyond the scientific scope and introduce implicitly or explicitly philosophical discussions as to the nature of the unity of living bodies. Their attitude is also per fectly justifiable, but as they enter the province of philosophy, the latter has the right to test their statements. Here, too, we may distinguish two main groups. Some authors hardly attempt to give an ontological explanation of the organism's unity; nevertheless without having first solved sufficiently this pre liminary problem they rush to hasty conclusions as to the organism's nature. We find in their views on the one hand a tendency to con ceive a living body as a natural unity, but on the othler, an unmis takable effort to explain its working through efficient causality alone, and the refusal to admit any finality. This tendency reveals itself especially in the conclusion that no difference exists between organic and inorganic bodies — a conclusion based chiefly upon the con sideration that some inorganic structures also manifest wholeness features. This kind of holism is, therefore, anti-vitalistic. The second group of holistic theories, proceeding beyond the empirical phenomenistic standpoint, endeavors to offer a positive contribution to the solving of the problem, how the wholeness and unity of living bodies should be explained, and accounts for it by admitting a unitary principle. From our point of view the alleged reason of unity may not always be satisfactory, but the effort to give some philosophical solution would seem to be a sufficient reason to call this group of theories by the name of ontological holism. But since these authors furthermore recognize the essential difference between living and non-living wholes, we prefer to call their doc trine vitalistic holism. A. ANTI-VITALISTIC HOLISM 1. One of the clearest examples of a theory which is definitely holistic and at the same time vigorously anti-vitalistic is the Gestalt</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 279 theory of W. Kôhler.50 The term "Gestalt" (configuration, unitary whole, form, pattern) has been hailed by many scholastics as a mark of great progress in psychology and biology; they considered it as a modern term to express the scholastic notion of "corpus naturale" and substance, and indeed the Gestalt theory has contributed greatly to the recognition of the unitary character of mental and biological processes, but the notion which the Gestaltists attribute to the term, although not atomistic, remains mechanistic and materialistic. The term and the notion of "Gestalt" were first used in psy chology. For example, a perception is a Gestalt, i. e., a unitary whole that is qualitatively different from the sum of its parts (the sensa tions), and whose properties, therefore, cannot be inferred from the summation of the properties of the parts; each part of the whole possesses particular qualities in so far as it belongs to the whole and is related to the other parts, but loses them when the part is dis connected from the whole. It is clear that such a conception rejects the analytical, summative methods of the atomists in psychology, namely, the associationists. Kôhler transferred the concept of Gestalt from psychology to the realm of physics and chemistry. On the terrain of physics, he claims that one may conceive of an electric field — a system of electrically charged and mutually connected condensators — as a Gestalt, be cause a change in one of the parts does not limit itself to that par ticular part but extends its influence over the whole field. Con sequently, an electric field follows certain Gestalt laws. We find in a physical Gestalt a distribution of energy which adopts a stationary character as soon as the most appropriate condition is reached. It is no wonder that the notion of Gestalt was applied also to the domain of physiology and biology. Kôhler applied it to the nervous processes as the physiological basis of perception,51 and by so doing he believed he brought the psychic process into accord with their physiological substrate. Kôhler considers the whole of a living body also as a Gestalt, a natural unity, dominated by the casual harmony. The processes in an organism can be derived from its properties as a 50.

Jahresherichte iiber die gesamte Physiologie, III (1925), p. 512.</page><page sequence="4">280 FRANCISCAN STUDIES Gestalt, i. e., an organism forms a unitary system whose internal energies are directed towards the equilibrium of the system as a whole. Just as in the case of physical Gestalts one observes a tendency towards a stationary status, yet the organism does not reach it be cause the conditions in the system continually change. This fact would therefore make an organic Gestalt different from a physical Gestalt, but the difference is only apparent, according to Kôhler, because we should take into account another fact, namely, that the parts of an organic Gestalt cohere functionally, i. e., the continuous supply of new energy from the other parts would prevent a par ticular part from reaching a stationary situation. Consequently, Kôhler concludes, biological Gestalts agree essentially with the physical ones; in other words, there is no essential difference between living bodies and dead matter, and vitalism has no right to exist.52 Kôhler's theory contains some valuable elements, but is thor oughly false from the philosophical standpoint. The author thinks that with the discovery of physical "forms" the problem between mechanism and vitalism has come to a close once and for all. Such a conclusion seems to be slightly premature and dangerous, for Kôhler confuses two problems of which he has solved only one and that partially. Mechanism includes merism. Now Kôhler has indeed proved the inadequacy of merism: his Gestalt theory is an attempt to rè ëstablish natural unities, but he fails to show the philosophical side of the problem. He does not even try to give a philosophical account of the empirically established unity of a Gestalt, and for that reason Kôhler's Gestalt is not at all identical with our scholastic conception of substance. Vitalism postulates a difference between life and lifeless matter. Despite his "discovery," Kôhler has not even touched the problem. First of all his physical Gestalts are not natural unities, they are — as Bertalanffy rightly observes53 — superficial parallels which do not exhibit the slightest resemblance to the real nature of organic forms. It is remarkable indeed that, for example, a system of con densators reveal some non-summative relationships, a fact which 52. Cf. M. A. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 40-44. 53. Kritiscbe Théorie der Formbildung (1928), p. 171.</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 281 shows that not even "free energy" is entirely without a Gestalt or wholeness character, but it is in itself only a dynamic condition and not a unitary entity existing in itself. And secondly, even if it were such a unity, the fact would not in the least settle the issue of vitalism. Most Scholastics likewise admit the existence of inorganic Gestalts in the sense of substances; for that reason Kohler's theory is not so new. But merely admitting their existence does not solve the question of their difference from organic substances; on the contrary, it only makes the problem evident. In summarizing we may say that Kohler's theory, being anti associatonistic, is anti-meristic. On the other hand, however, it is pure mechanism, for Kôhler conceives of forces and energies in a merely causal way. When he speaks of forces which are directed upon the establishment of equilibrium, he does not attach any teleological meaning to the term direction. Repeatedly he rejects all striving to a goal and all finality, and he makes a great effort to explain vital processes in a causal-mechanical way. Kôhler admits nothing but lifeless matter and energy, and thus can be termed a materialist. 2. Whereas Kôhler was first and foremost a psychologist, and through psychology was brought to accept the notion of unity and wholeness, several biologists read this unity directly from the ob servation of the organism's behavior, but do not deviate essentially from Kohler's conclusions.54 Thus M. Heidenhain with his theory of organosynthese, enkapsis, and histosystems.55 A histosystem is a state, a condition of living matter which is more than the sum of its parts. An organism is a cosmos, a universe, whose parts are corre lated with each other in such a way that the whole of it disposes of its own correlation forces which direct the cells during their development — these forces are called by Heidenhain, histodynamic activities. One will look in vain for similar forces in the realm of physics. They are to our actual knowledge exclusively proper to life. Nevertheless, according to Heidenhain, it seems a legitimate sup 54. Cf. Th. van der Bom, op. cit., pp. 110-114. 55. Formen und Krafte in der lebendigen Natur (Vortâge und Aufsâtze ûber Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen, herausgegeben von W. Roux), Heft 32 (1923).</page><page sequence="6">282 FRANCISCAN STUDIES position that these forces will be later described in an analogical manner to that which in physics accounts for its energies (pro cedure tried out in fact by Kôhler, as we pointed out). Th. Haering56 has further elaborated the same ideas. An organ ism is, according to him, a substantial unity or individual, i. e., a whole whose parts, despite a certain relative independence, cannot as such be and act without the whole; whereas the whole, although it cannot be and act without the parts, is something new with re spect to its parts. This notion, Haering emphasizes, is not only realized in the organic world, but also in that of lifeless matter. The atom is something thoroughly new with regard to its electrons which compose the unity of the atom, and likewise the molecule is qualitatively different from the sum of its atoms. What Haering's idea of unity really amounts to is clear from the fact that he applies the same notion to the solar system, after the manner of White head,57 who conceives of the universe as an organic whole. Similar ideas are advanced by B. Fisher,58 who believes he is able to draw from them conclusions as to the nature of living bodies. He reasons as follows: When oxygen and hydrogen react upon each other, not a sum of their qualities, but something qualitatively dif ferent namely, water, comes into existence. Now an organism re veals the same characteristics with regard to its constitutive parts; therefore, he concludes, there is no difference between living and non-living individualities. And then he leaps to a still wider con clusion: Just as the purely chemical synthesis of atoms brings forth bodies with entirely new properties, in the same way the synthesis of living matter in ever higher complications gives birth to new higher qualities, even the new quality of consciousness as it appears in man. A similar conclusion is reached by H. Pxribam59 on the basis of the numerous analogies between crystals and organisms. Both dispose of a certain heterogeneity and show many other analogous characteristics. Consequently the conclusion should be, according 56. Ü her Individualitat in Natur und Geisteswelt (1926). 57. Process and Reality (New York, 1929). 58. Vitalismus und Pathologie (1924). 59. "Kristall-Analogien zur Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen," Arch. f.

Borntraeger, 10, 1926).</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 283 to Pxribam, that living bodies are of the same nature as crystals, which must be conceived of as a kind of spatial grates into whose lines the atoms of a chemical matter are mechanically distributed and coordinated. It hardly requires further discussion to see that the above the ories, although anti-meristic, profess an extreme mechanism. Fischer, for instance, explicitly concludes from the presence of some dystel eologies in organic life, the existence of purely mechanistic forces. Although these biologists admit that living syntheses follow their own laws, all of them stress the fact that similar holistic laws rule also in organic syntheses, and hence they jump to the conclusion that the vital laws are not essentially different from the mechanical ones. The reason why the concept of "Gestalt" and individuality found so ready an acceptance in modern biology was precisely be cause many biologists see in it a concept which fully allows for the obvious manifestations of the unity of a living body, yet does not force them, as they believe, to abandon the old ideal of a uni form, mechanical explanation of everything that belongs to our experience. Still these mechanistic holists commit a serious offense against logic, because they draw a conclusion which is not covered by the premises. From the fact that organic as well as inorganic bodies should be considered as wholes, units, individuals, it does not follow that there is no difference between them. The only logical conclusion would be that both postulate a principle of unity. Once that has been granted, there still remains the following question: Is perhaps the uniting principle of organic bodies different from that of inor ganic ones? The supposition underlying the logical error of these authors is their false idea about the theory of those philosophers who require such a principle: one need not to be a vitalist at all — as they falsely suppose — to admit an "immaterial factor" as the ultimate explana tion of any corporeal individual as such. This false conception is the reason why they are lacking in any explanation of the unity of individuality which they admit on em pirical grounds. Yet speaking of the nature of life, they tended to be philosophical, consequently we might rightly exact an answer to this essential question. But they hardly seem to see this problem.</page><page sequence="8">284 FRANCISCAN STUDIES At most they give it a subjectivistic turn, as for instance Haering, who answers it in a Kantian way. According to him, individuality is a last category, a form of the intellect, which is not susceptible to further intellectual analysis. This interpretation leads us to the following group of theories. 3. This group comprises the holistic theories tinged with sub jectivism. Thus among others Max Hartmann,60 who considers the concept of unity exclusively as a manifestation of aprioristic laws of the thinking subject. A typical example is H. J. Jordan.61 He calls his method analyti cal-synthetic. Analysis makes us know parts and partial functions and isolates the causal factors as if they were independent causes, whereas synthesis restores the disturbed relationship and tries to determine the nature of the connection through intellectual insight. Synthesis, however, should not be conceived of as summative, like that which we apply to a machine, for the living body reveals itself to us as a natural unit or totality; it manifests a cooperation and interaction of all its parts in strictly mutual relations. The question arises as to how the unity is to be explained. According to Jordan, it is not due to something objective, given in reality, but originates only in and from our thinking consciousness. Jordan stands on the basis of a Kantian epistemology; our concept of organic totality is solely due to the necessary function of our judging reason (Urteilskraft). This it is which enables us and justifies us at the same time to synthesize the elements found through analysis, into a nexus of dynamic totality. We must start with estab lishing in an analytic way the working of the causal factors, and after that our reason synthesizes the empirical data of our morpho logical and physiological investigation into a causal nexus and recog nizes the logical meaning (Bedeutung) of the empirical factors, i. e., the influence which one part exercises on other parts and on the total function. Briefly, synthesis, unity, and totality are only a prod uct of our way of thinking. 60.

Allgemeine vergleichende Physiologie der Tiere (Berlin-Leipzig, 1929) ; and numerous articles in various periodicals.</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 285 Neither should we attribute an objective sense to terms like "meaning," "intercausal relation," "finality." Jordan rejects as un scientific any opinion which would suppose real finality.62 In the organism, only the causality of partial relationships exists; meaning or finality are put into it by our thinking intellect. After we have established in this way the unity and totality of organism, we must conclude, according to Jordan, that an organism is something specific, entirely different from, for instance, a machine. It is true, the organism is, just like a machine, a structure whose working depends exclusively on effective causal factors; but whereas the machine is an open causal structure, "whose effective or purpose ful" functioning requires the continuous interference of man, the living body is instead a "closed causal structure" in which the inter action of the factors is "dominated" by intercausal relationship, which man is unable to describe except in terms of "logical mean ing" and scope. This closed unitary structure with interrelated causality is therefore the specific feature of life, but — it must be again repeated — this typical characteristic is not, according to Jordan, something primarily and objectively given in reality itself, but a concept added by our reason to the "causal" factors as they appear in our experience. But then we may ask the question that always arises with regard to Kantian epistemology: If totality and finality are not inherent in the organisms in reality, i. e., independently of the working of the intellect, but are only due to intellectual forms, by what right does our reason apply these forms? One may even ask if the very notions of analysis and synthesis which form the starting point for Jordan's doctrine have any real sense, if unity and totality are not supposed from the very outset? Furthermore, we believe that with this subjectivistic epistemology Jordan defeats his own object, namely, to free himself from mech anism by accepting organic totality. If the unity and totality of the organism are nothing but a subjective concept, it follows that in the organism itself there does not exist any real principle which 62.

It is true in such a supposition that our intellect would put a nexus between the effective-causal partial operations of the organism, but in reality the activity of the latter is merely a sum of mechanical partial functions. Consequently, in the last resort, Jordan's theory, despite its attempt to establish a holistic view, leads back to meristic mechanism plus an intellectual form of unity. And since such intellectual forms would hold for any unitary structure, as well as for inorganic ones, the theory does not account for the proper character of life as such; in other words, it is not even vitalistic merism.63 4. A particular attitude towards the life-problem is taken by A. Meyer.64 Being the father of the very term "holism," he pro fesses, of course, a holistic opinion, but after first having repudiated the mechanistic view, he later tries to smuggle it in again by a cir cuitous route. He makes an attempt to explain in a very simple way the relation between organic and inorganic laws. In doing so his procedure is exactly opposite to that of the mechanists, but he arrives at the same destination. Whereas the mechanists derive the biological from the physical laws, Meyer pretends that finally we must be able, by means of simplifying deduction, to derive the main physical laws from the general biological laws. In this procedure Meyer links up with certain views of J. S. Haldane's theory of sciences. The physical and chemical phenomena are, according to Haldane, whom we will take up hereafter, inept for the explanation of life. One may be rather inclined to think that biology will render physics and chemistry superfluous than the reverse. If, therefore, a point of contact exists between biology and physics "and one of the two sciences will be swallowed up, that one will not be biology."63 Meyer has further elaborated this thought of Haldane, but draws from it a strange conclusion. He reasons as follows: The biological principles and axioms are more universal and have a larger range of validity than the physical laws. It must, therefore, be the task of biology to formulate them in such a way that the physical laws 63. Cf. M. A. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 45-48. 64.

Haldane, The Sciences and Philosophy (London, 1928), p. 95.</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 287 can be deduced from them. But the latter are open to a mathemati cal formula. Consequently the biological laws demand also a mathe matical formulation; otherwise we would be unable to deduce the physical laws from them. Thus Meyer reaches a conclusion directly opposite to Haldane, who believes that, concerning life processes, mathematics fall short of the mark. Unfortunately Meyer does not even attempt to prove his conclusion; all he does is support it with some examples and analogies which for that matter are hardly successful. He speaks of the mathematical formula of the falling cat, which would com prise the physical laws of falling as well as the laws directing the reactions of self-preservation in the falling animal, and he contends that such a formula should be found, but he himself fails to formulate it.66 B. VITALISTIC HOLISM Under this caption we shall mention — as we pointed out pre viously — those theories which accept the organism to be a natural unity and which consider organic unities as specifically different from inorganic bodies. As to the philosophical explanation of the unity and specificity of living bodies, some of the theories concern ing it are apparently developed under the more or less outspoken influence of Kantian subjectivism; others propose an explanation in terms of an objective principle; some others profess a dualistic view; and finally there are those which call for one immanent life principle. 1. A holistic view which in some respects indulges perhaps too much in subjectivistic speculations but which is definitely vitalistic is that of J. S. Haldane.67 The author admits the existence of specific unities in nature, whose structure hangs together and maintains itself as a whole. Thus there are e. g., molecules and organisms. The latter are further more specifically different from physical and chemical phenomena, as is clear from the "co-ordinated physiological activity, the active 66. Cf. M. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 50-52. 67. The Sciences and Philosophy (London, 1928) ; The Philosophical Basis of Biology (London, 1932) ; Respiration, 2nd edn. (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1935.)</page><page sequence="12">288 FRANCISCAN STUDIES regulation."68 The unity and specific character of organic activity is "just a manifestation of nature."69 In order to explain both the unity and the specificity of living bodies, Haldane positively main tains that "we need philosophy, not merely science."70 But in this respect, the author is somewhat disappointing. His philosophical dis cussions have rather the character of a theory of science; moreover he formulates the distinction between the various kinds of natural unities far too much from the thinking subject. 2. A prominent place in the history of life-theories belongs to those which we would like to call holistic neovitalism in distinction to the meristic forms of neovitalism mentioned before. Whereas Reinke and the psycho-vitalists admit a plurality of special life forces, the neovitalists we refer to here advance a much more unitary view by admitting a single vital factor to account for the specific totality of the organism. The best-known representative of this latter kind is H. Driesch.71 Driesch's life theory is vested in an Aristotelean terminology which, however, covers a Platonic dualism mixed with Kantian episte mology. A disciple of Haeckel and Roux, Driesch started off as a thorough mechanist, but he soon found himself unable to reconcile his experiments on the so-called regulation — eggs, especially those of the sea urchin — with the deductions of the rigid machine theory and Roux's preformistic mosaic theory. Instead, his cleavage and melting experiments on eggs and embryos showed, so he urged, a wonderful plasticity of living matter which went to such an extent that every part of the egg, if isolated, might become the whole (totipotency) at least in the earlier stages of evolution. A complete organism came into existence no matter what the number or the place of the cleavages, or the manner of fusions were. But no one knows or can even imagine a machine whose every part could de velop into the entire machine. Consequently, Driesch concluded, the biologist is forced to look for some non-mechanical, non-physical, 68. The Sciences and Philosophy (London, 1928), p. 169. 69. Op. cit., p. 165. 70.

(Leipzig, 1934).</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 289 non-material factor to account for the plasticity of the life process. And since these processes are always striving towards the forming of a whole, the principle must be a "wholemaking" factor (ganz machender Kausalfaktor). Driesch borrowed the name of this teleological principle, which was to explain the obvious wholeness and individuality of an organ ism, from Aristotle, and called it entelechy. He conceives of entel echy, however, in a very different way from Aristotle,- and that is the reason why he overshoots his own mark, namely, the defeat of mechanism. For Aristotle, entelechy is the substantial principle which lends the specifying form to the indetermined primary matter with which it constitutes one substance, and this holds true whether the sub stantial unity or natural body be organic or inorganic. The formal principle, as opposed to or rather distinguished from matter, is in itself not matter, but on the other hand it is — except in man and for particular reasons — material in the sense that in non-living bodies, plants, and animals, it cannot operate nor even exist inde pendently of matter. Driesch's entelechy, on the contrary, is not only immaterial in the sense that it is not matter, but also in the second sense; and there the essential difference between Driesch and Aristotle begins. Driesch considers his entelechy as supra-spatial and supra-individual, and therefore more or less detached from matter in its existence. Hovering as it were over space and matter, it acts upon the physico chemical forces of matter, which consequently are conceived as al ready determined, by directing or even inhibiting and checking them, and thus it individualizes itself in matter. The relationship between Driesch's directing supra-material entelechy and matter shows a striking resemblance to the difference that exists between a machine and its driver. But such a conception is Platonic, not Aristotelean. And so it is clear that this theory splits the unity of the organism again into two not only distinguishable but also separated com ponents, namely, an entelechy which moves a certain amount of matter. This amount of matter shows a striking similarity to Descartes' body-machine. As a matter of fact Driesch himself admits this similarity when he says that his vitalism should rather deserve</page><page sequence="14">290 FRANCISCAN STUDIES the name of machine-theory.72 He defines an organism as a sum of material parts directed and held in check by an immaterial entity, more or less mysterious, and therefore — most probably in spite of Driesch's own intention — the empirically established unity of the living body falls through again. The entelechy itself with its supra-individual character bears a particular resemblance to the human soul as it was wrongly con ceived by Averroes. We find the same idea of supra-individuality with Ed. von Hartmann, who also conceives of the vital principle as of a directive, immaterial, supra-individual, unconscious entity.73 This philosopher, himself influenced by Kant's transcendentalism, showed his influence on Driesch also in the last feature of the entel echy, that of "unconsciousness." Driesch's entelechy is not free from psychovitalistic specks: the author ascribes to it some sort of quasi-knowledge and volition but without consciousness. So we must conclude that the present theory is not a "Drieschean Aristotelism," as A. Meyer74 calls it and as E. Nordenskiôld75 seems to suggest. Driesch's vitalism is indeed so much "Drieschean" that very little "Aristotelean" is left except for some terms. It would scarcely be of any harm if such statements as expressed by Meyer, et al., would demonstrate only the authors' misunderstanding of Aristotle's metaphysics, yet the dangerous consequence is that the Aristotelean and ultimately Scholastic life theory may become dis credited in the eyes of some who know as little of it as those we have just mentioned.76 There still remains a word to say about the experiments on the regulation of germ-parts and the regulation of Tubularia and Cla 72.

Nordenskiôld, this author in his otherwise excellent book on the history of biology shows the typical attitude of a mechanistic scientist when it comes to the evaluation of mechanism versus vitalism. As long as a theory is mechanistic it is, according to the author, purely scientific and perfectly understandable, but as soon as vitalistic ideas are introduced it becomes in his eyes philosophical, metaphysical, and thus unintelligible. Now the color of things depends largely upon the type of glasses one wears, but not all people wear the right spectacles. Mechanism, by deny ing any other forces but mechanical, is evidently as a system, despite its negative wording, just as much a positive metaphysical theory as vitalism is by denying that mechanical forces are sufficient to account for life phenomena.</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 291 vellina, upon which Driesch based his theory. They certainly refute Roux's mosaic theory and Weismann's theory of the determiners (determination occurs only in the later stages of the egg's evolution) — but do they prove Driesch's own neovitalishi ? M. Hartmann,77 H. J. Jordan,78 and especially Th. Boveri and J. Schanel, on the basis of renewed experimentation, deny it; and L. von Bertalanffy,79 although himself in favor of holism and vitalism, agrees with them. A discussion of these experiments would of course lead us far be yond the purpose of this article. However, the general remark im poses itself; all Driesch's arguments try to bring out the idea that an organism should be conceived as an unitary, teleological whole. Nevertheless the concept of wholeness does not by that fact imply that the whole-making principle is a vital principle, because non living natural bodies require also an entelechy or substantial form.80 S. Becher81 arrives, on the basis of other experiments, at the same conclusion of a finalistic, supra-individual life principle. Similar ideas are advanced by E. Ungerer.82 Of more importance, because of their greater influence and application to other fields of biology, are the works of Woltereck and von Uexkiill. R. Woltereck83 is a staunch defender of organic unity. Every organism is, according to him, an individual, a unitary structure (ganzes Gefüge), in which the various properties do not form a mosaic, but are connected so as to form a Gestalt. The principle which causes the unity is called by Woltereck the reaction-norm (Reaktionsnorm), because it is to be conceived as the norm or rule which governs all the organism's reactions to internal and external influences. It is specific for the different species of plants and animals, and thus determines all that is proper to the species. The norm operates upon a material substrate which therefore is also specific for the various species; in other words, the character 77. Biologie und Philosophie (Berlin, 1925). 78.

Woltereck's hypothesis is that the matrix-matter is present in the chromosomes which support the gens. The author has propounded his opinion mainly as an explanation of heredity and evolution. He distinguishes, for that matter, three kinds of characteristics in every organism. First, the phenotypical marks, i. e., the external reversible properties induced from the out side; the fact that an organism reacts in such and such a way on external stimuli is due to the reaction-norm. Secondly, the geno typical properties; i.e., those of the race, which are external but still additive or replaceable, though not necessary to the species. They are tied together into a unity by the norm, because the specific manner in which an organism reacts on the presence of particular gens depends also on the reaction-norm. Finally, the spe cific properties, i. e., those that characterize the species. They are the direct manifestation of the reaction-norm, and therefore are not replaceable but remain the same, because the norm in the hereditary course of generation after generation stays the same as long as the species remains what it is. The latter words should be emphasized because Woltereck believes in the evolution of the species, yet con sistently demands that the reaction-norm be changed for its realiza tion. We can, he points out, explain evolution only if we admit that in the living world there exists an internal potency for further evo lution and at the same time an internal compulsion (tnnerer Zwang) driving towards that evolution. Even though, it is true, Woltereck claims to reject all teleology, he nevertheless admits immanent final ity as a matter of fact in accounting for evolution. Overlooking the author's habit of continuously creating new terms, a habit which sometimes degenerates into a kind of word cult, we believe that this system contains very valuable elements, be cause it accounts for the specific unity as well as the individual dif ferences of the organism. On the other hand, several of the objec tions brought forth against Driesch hold true also here. Woltereck's dualism is certainly less pronounced than Driesch's, in as far as he does not claim supra-individuality for his reaction-norm, but he nevertheless draws a too sharp line of demarcation between the material substrate and the immaterial directive factor. This seems to be due to Kantian influences. For he holds that we can conceive the</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 293 specific form of an organism, and consequently its directive norm, only as an idea; and thus he arrives not only at a distinction but also at a separation of form and matter, and attributes to both an exist ence of their own. In scholastic terms we would call both of them a complete substance. But then again the natural unity of the organ ism is not real but apparent. Finally Woltereck shows a tendency towards psychovitalism, ascribing to all organisms, including plants, because of their obvious finality, some psychic properties, namely, what he calls primary knowing and willing, and these qualities are even more anthropo morphic than in Driesch's conception, because he speaks of sensitive knowledge and striving.84 Despite their intentions, the starting point of the foregoing authors is some kind of — we might say almost hereditary — mecha nistic conception, and such a vitium originis revenges itself, of course, in its consequences. This is particularly clear in the theory of J. von Uexkiill who, notwithstanding his similarity to Driesch, falls back into merism.85 A living body is, according to Uexküll, different from inorganic nature for the reason that it is a whole (Ganzheit), in as much as inorganic nature knows only summative structures and no real units. The organism is in itself only a bundle of physico-chemical forces, but these are connected into a system because of an obvious striving towards a goal (Zielstrebigkeit). Thus we are forced to conceive the system as ruled by immaterial purposefulness (immatérielle Planmaszigkeit). The latter directs matter and its inorganic forces by means of impulses which operate in the first place in the cells; the cells, however, should be consid ered as autonomous, because each one of them is ruled by its own ' 'impulse-melody. This short outline makes it evident that Uexkiill, although com bating the machine-theory, sticks to the old meristic and mechanistic conceptions more closely than Driesch and much more than Wol tereck. This follows clearly from his opinion about the autonomy of the cells and from his analysis of vital actions. A reflex act pro ceeds, according to him, in a purely mechanical way. In instinctive 84. Cf. M. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 39 et teq. 85. Theoretische Biologie, 2nd edn. (Berlin, 1928).</page><page sequence="18">294 FRANCISCAN STUDIES and sensitive reactions, however, some particular impulses intervene in the following way: each nerve-cell is an isolated unit, a sort of "nerve-person," but under the influence of an impulse it is possible to transfer the stimulus from one "nerve-person" to another. Consequently Uexküll reduces again the organism to a com plicated machine plus something else, and this "plus" is not one force or spirit but many spirits which drive the wheels (Hinter den Radern). Uexküll marks, therefore, a retrogression in the theory of vital energies. The author attempts, it is true, to save the unity of the life processes by using words such as "finality," "impulse," to denote the factor which is supposed to unify and govern the whole of stimuli and reactions. But these words — and vague words at that — cover, if they cover anything at all, nothing more than a biologi cal Platonism as Ehrenberg rightly observes.86 In reality, Uexküll teaches a meristic machine-theory with holistic and vitalistic terms, while yet showing tendencies more realistic, although not entirely free from Kantian epistemology. He recognizes the objective value of finality and counts it among the constitutive qualities of reality.87 3. The idea of finalistic impulses as directing life processes is expressed in another group of theories which are usually called hormic theories. The theories which might be grouped under this heading are vitalistic: they attribute to the organism a vital force because of its obviously teleological activities. Besides they are more or less holistic, because they consider that force as a unitary principle. C. Z. von Monakov calls this principle hormè, since it is the factor that in individual evolution strives towards the development of all the potentialities which the individual's precursors have col lected in the past. W. McDougall calls it soul. Although his animism differs in many respects from the Aristotelean, yet it contains enough elements to label it anti-meristic vitalism. The author maintains that, because vital processes cannot be explained sufficiently in a mecha nistic way, the only reasonable hypothesis is to admit the existence of "some non-mechanical teleological factor," the soul, which he con ceives as a "unitary being." He admits the possibility of what Scho 86. Die Naturwissenschaften, Bd. 17 (1929), p. 777. 87. Cf. M. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 37 et teq.</page><page sequence="19">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 295 lastics term plurality of forms, namely, the possibility of more than one soul in one bodily organism; but even so, he believes that in any organism there is one principle which is "the chief of a hier archy of similar beings."88 The main — and very essential — differ ence between McDougall's animism and Aristotle's holistic hylo morphism is that the former conceives of the soul as only "asso ciated" in a Platonic way with the body. In some respects H. Bergson may be said also to propound a hormistic, teleological doctrine. By refuting associationism con tinuously he shows himself to be definitely anti-meristic and anti mechanistic. If in our introspections we "feel ourselves into" the facts of our own experience, if we "live" them through some "sympa thetic view," we ascertain that they are in continuous motion, or, as Bergson puts it, the states of my consciousness reveal "pure dura tion." He believes that the mistake made by the mechanists is that they confuse pure duration with space, which induces them to be lieve that our conscious states are divisible and measurable.89 In his L'évolution créatrice (1907) Bergson extends this theory beyond the realm of the conscious and teaches that the intimate na ture of all reality is continuous motion in the above sense. In all beings there is l'élan vital, a universal vital impulse which drives all things to develop towards their goal. This creative evolution is unconscious in plants, instinctively conscious in animals, rationally conscious in man. It is to be noted that still another group of theories speaks of some kind of hormic or driving factors, but only in passing, namely, the various schools of psychoanalysis with their "libido," "eros," etc. They can, however, hardly be called vitalistic; most of them are purely materialistic and atomistic. 4. The last group of theories to be mentioned are those types of synthetic biology which require an objective immanent principle in organisms as the cause of their immanent activity. They admit units of matter with individual existence and recognize the specific character of living bodies. To account for it they postulate some immanent principle which they mainly describe in objective terms. 88. W. McDougall, Body and Mind, 8th edn. (Methuen, London, 1938), pp. 364 et seq. 89. H. Bergson, Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience (1889).</page><page sequence="20">296 FRANCISCAN STUDIES It is to be admitted that the authors who seem to hold these ideas are not always very clear or exact in the way they advance them. Sometimes they rather imply than express them; and not all of them are always consistent as to their principle or purpose, mainly for reasons of their particular starting point or method. Yet, no doubt, this general outline — after all Aristotelean in concept, if not in words — is the frame of several modern systems. Of course, it is evident that no theory turns up suddenly like Pallas out of Zeus' forehead. After Descartes, and outside the Aristotelean-Scholastic tradition but clearly influenced by it, we find some though not very numerous representatives. One of the first is J. E. Stahl (1660-1734).90 In our mind this author is not done justice especially in many textbooks of Scholastic philosophy. Although living in a time of rigorous mechanistic views, he shows a remarkable resemblance to the old tradition of Scholastic biology. He rejects both mechanism and vitalism in the sense in which they were then understood. His opposition to mechanism is manifest from the first chapter of his main work in which he deals with the difference between mechanism and organism. He strongly refutes the summative, meristic viewpoint of mechanism and states that an organism is essentially different from a machine, because it is a unified, integrated structure. But he inveighs against con temporary vitalism as well, because the theory of vital energies, vital spirits and the like, is equally destructful to the organism's unity. Still he maintains a strenuous defense of vitalism in the old animistic sense of the word. In order to give a sufficient reason for the particular structure of a living body and of the finality of its functions, he admits the soul as the principle of life: the soul holds the parts of the body together into one unity; the soul is the essential principle not only of consciousness (in man and ani mals) but also of all other organic processes such as circulation of the blood, absorption, etc. We, therefore, consider Stahl definitely a holistic vitalist. It is true that there are passages in his work which seem to reveal some Platonic rather than Aristotelean conceptions, but this may be due to his obscure style and difficult way of expressing himself. He cer 90. Theoria medica vera (Halle, 1708).</page><page sequence="21">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 297 tainly adheres strongly to Aristotle, as is clear from the fact that he quotes this author's arguments often, for example, those in favor of the finality of vital operations. The same ambiguous obscurity may be the reason why several biologists who claim to be his follow ers, as e. g., Bichat, the Montpellier school, and C. F. Wolff, deviate from their master's fundamental conception and fall back to a semi mechanistic vitalism, as we have pointed out previously. Stahl is often accused of psychovitalism. If by that term ,is understood what is commonly meant by it, namely, the opinion that animals and even plants enjoy consciousness of the finality of their reactions, the charge is not true, as is clear from his insistence upon the concept of an unconscious soul (anima in scia) outside man — the very concept for which he was criticized by Haller. Finally, we frequently find one or another of Stahl's sentences, quoted as his definition of life, subjected to criticism. Now, it is not difficult, in deed, to find a whole series of such definitions in his works. There are three or four and even more passages in which Stahl says "Life is nothing else but — " and then some sort of definition follows. But such statements should be interpreted according to the context. It is clearly not his intention to formulate a definition of life but only to point out some particular feature in which the life process that he is dealing with at the moment differs from mechanical phenomena. Another fervent opponent of the mechanistic and partly mate rialistic spirit of his time is Ch. Bonnet (1720-1793).91 He too adheres in many points to Aristotle; he is a finalistic vitalist and attributes to even the lowest animals an indivisible soul, although its indivisibility is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the author's incapsulation theory and the facts of regeneration. As a representative of holistic vitalism in the following century we cite J. P. Miiller (1801-1859).92 This author, too, is often repre sented as just another follower of the theory of vital energies. This does not seem correct. Miiller leans towards Stahl, although not admitting all of the latter's ideas; and in quite a few respects he is in line with Aristotelic-Scholastic biology, sometimes even in ter minology. Miiller is an outspoken vitalist; to him the living is 91. Contemplation de la nature (Amsterdam, 1769) ; La palingénésie philoso phique (Lyons, 1770). 92. Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen (Coblenz, 1837-1840).</page><page sequence="22">298 FRANCISCAN STUDIES essentially different from the inorganic in that the former strives towards a definite goal (Zweckmazigkeit, Zielstrebigkeit), the activ ity of all parts of an organism cooperating to the preservation of the whole. Müller is thus finalist and anti-merist. He calls the ontologi cal cause of this finality the "organic force." It is found in every living body, gives it its specific nature, and produces, according to its nature, the integrative parts actually (actu) out of the germ which contains the whole potentially (potentia). The organic force which is the life principle of all organisms must, according to Miiller, be distinguished from the rational creative force, "which is the principle of consciousness in man and higher animals." Here it is not clear what kind of distinction the author intends and whether distinction means separation in such a way that in man there would be two kinds of principles. Apart from the latter point, we find in Midler's conception of life several ideas that approach closely to Scholasticism. Among the present day biologists propounding an immanence theory at least to some extent, we note in the first place von Ber talanffy.93 This biologist who connects philosophical speculations with experimental research work, takes up a strong stand against mechanistic conceptions and strenuously promotes a wholeness theory Ganzheitstheorie. He recognizes an ontological principle of the unity of material units and also of the specific character of living units. Admitting that in the physical field, too, we find "Gestalts" or forms, he resolutely disallows Kôhler's claims that for this reason no difference exists between organic and inorganic forms. Kôhler's inorganic forms lack exactly, according to Bertalanffy, the character istic which constitutes the essence of an organic unit, namely, its autonomy versus the outside world revealing itself in the autonomy of metabolism, the autonomy of exchange of energy, and the au tonomy of form-change. These are experimentally proved facts and we must, therefore, conclude that the cause which determines the activity of a living body lies in the organism itself. Hence we must, Bertalanffy holds, recognize as the source of the unity, autonomy, 93. "Das Problem des Lebens," Scientia, Vol. 41 (1927).

Such a theory is evidently a sample of holistic, immanent vital ism. Bertalanffy it is true, claims himself opposed to vitalism, but the type of vitalism he means is that of Driesch. The latter he re jects because of his conception of immanence; he rightly points out that in Driesch's system the whole-making factor is conceived as too loose from matter and as directing the life machine more or less from the outside. Bertalanffy repudiates also the psychic anthropomorphic element in Driesch's entelechy. He does not show himself averse to finalistic conceptions but only if they are stripped of all psychovitalistic ele ments. In this respect he points out that the mechanists continually use terms and even notions which are thoroughly finalistic and that run counter to their own system. Thus, for example, the notion of selection; natural selection spares only that which is useful and adapted, yet usefulness is clearly a teleological concept. Thus, too, the idea of evolution; such a notion implies a rising to ever higher forms, which of course implies a finalistic evaluation. Even the con cept of an organic machine, so dear to mechanists, includes teleology; and Bertalanffy, therefore calls that concept a kryptoteleologic idea. One certainly will grant that Bertalanffy advances ideas which seem to be akin to Aristotle's. Yet there is a profound difference on account of the former's starting point. This starting point is posi tivism, the doctrine which claims that all knowledge should be considered only as a succession of sensorial impressions or conscious phenomena. True knowledge of the nature of things is to the posi tivist a fiction and consequently philosophy, which attempts to approach the essence of things, is devoid of scientific value. The "idea" of an object is for him nothing but a general image of phan tasy; like some sort of greatest common divisor it is formed out of the mass of many similar perceptions. Bertalanffy is related to the neopositivism of the Viennese circle, whose members94 advance a system which is known as the philosophy 94. R.

As the name indicates, they intend to develop a philosophy on the basis of the sciences, supposing thereby as a general principle that the laws and rules found in scientific researches should be the only norms of our thinking. Bertalanffy, too, strives clearly towards the ideal of a conception of life-phenomena founded exclusively upon the results of science. Hence he denies to the notion of cause all deeper meaning, and conceives of it in the positivistic sense as merely a regular and con stant succession of phenomena or events. Despite his words about teleology as sketched above, he endeavors to give them a positivistic turn and does not show himself averse to Kôhler's "explanation" of finality, stating that just as efficient causality means nothing else but the dependence of a present A on a past B, so should final causality be conceived as the dependence of a present A on a future B.95 Now positivism is an offspring of empiricism, which lies also at the basis of mechanism. And, therefore, Bertalanffy's starting point makes it clear that, despite everything else, the mechanistic view still shines through in his works. In his later works96 he turns even more definitely in the mechanistic direction. Whereas in 1928 he expresses doubt if the — yet to be found — fundamental laws of biology ever could be derived from those of physics, in 1932 he leaves this question open, or rather surmises as affirmative an answer as possible. It would, he believes, perhaps not be impossible in the future to reduce both the physical and biological laws to some kind of higher statistics, consequently to some more or less indefinite mathematical formula.97 Ideas of an organismal, synthetic biology, kindred to Bertalanffy's appear in the works of A. von Gurwitch,98 who calls the vital prin ciple morphè, of P. Weiss,99 and especially of J. Schaxel,100 who 95. Kritiscbe Theorie der Formbildung, p. 81. 96. Theoret. Biol. (1932). 97. Cf. M. Bruna, op. cit., pp. 44 et seq. 98.

Among the modern biologists who, although not belonging to our school, come nevertheless close to it, we should like to mention the names of A. Pütter and K. Sapper. To the question — which Bertalanffy answered evasively — namely, if with our ever-increasing insight into the laws of nature we should ultimately not be able to reduce the biological to physical laws, Pütter101 gives an absolutely negative answer. Even though we should acquire, he holds, a complete knowledge of the physical phenomena and their laws, it would not help us in the least to clear up the life phenomena as a whole. He, too, recognizes the existence not only of organic but also of inorganic forms (Gestalten), yet maintains that the former diifer from the latter by their "automaty" or self-activity. Perhaps still more points of contact with Scholastic biology are to be found in the writings of K. Sapper.102 This author decidedly rejects the summative and anti-finalistic conception of mechanism by pointing to the evaluation of the parts of the organism with relation to its whole: We find clearly that those parts which are more impor tant for the preservation of the whole are advantaged, e. g., in the feeding process, above other less important parts. Such a determina tion of values and order of process is, of course, unheard of in a summation-system and can be understood only — he rightly con cludes— in a unitary structure in which the whole is more than the parts.103 The analytical methods of physics and chemistry are not and cannot be, according to Sapper, applicable to the evolution processes of form and structure of living beings, for the two following reasons. Fir?t, the physical sciences try, on the basis of their methods, to formulate laws which hold universally and forego, for example, the particular form and magnitude of things. Thus the law of gravity 101. S tuf en des Lebens (1923). 102. Das Element der Wirklichkeit und die Welt der Erfahrung (1924); Na turphilosophie, Philosophie des Organischen (1928). 103. Phil, des Organischen, pp. 52 et seq.</page><page sequence="26">302 FRANCISCAN STUDIES holds for all material objects, independently of their absolute magni tude and form. But an organism possesses a strictly defined mag nitude and a typical form. Consequently it stands to reason that a method which does not take into account absolute magnitude and form is unable to grasp the living. A second characteristic of the physico-chemical method is seen by Sapper in the fact that the vari ous classes of phenomena, which the physical and chemical laws express, can and must be considered separately. The law of gravity, for example, can be formulated completely without respect to other laws, such as that of elasticity, those concerning heat, etc. But we do not find this characteristic when it comes to formulating the biological laws: no single process can be considered separately, but all processes are reacting upon each other mutually. For these and similar reasons Sapper rejects meristic mechanism. In particular he inveighs against the chance theories which at least verbally excluded finality, pointing out, with sharp criticism, "the absurdity, nay ineptitude," of a conception which believes that the forms and structures of the organisms and their functions are due to sheer chance.104 Sapper concedes that, along with the many purposeful reactions which one observes in living bodies, one can doubtlessly mark out also many dysteleologies, e. g., unsuitable for mations and processes; one may even say that some dysteleology clings to every purposeful act. It is always these dysteleologies which are made much of by the opponents of this theory, but Sapper re marks rightly, for instance, against Fischer, that they do not mean any conclusive refutation of the finalistic theory. He points to the distinction so well known to the old and Scholastic philosophers, between general finality and the purposeful course of a particular process; in order to speak of a teleological world it is not necessary at all that every particular process should impress us as proceeding there and then purposefully, as it is only a special and often arbi trarily isolated item of reality. And he concludes that finality is to be bound in every process of nature, be it organic or inorganic; this he denotes by the term panteleology. For in every process, even in mechanical motion, besides quantity which expresses itself in the magnitude of the mass to be moved, and besides intensity, which 104. Phil, des Organischen, p. 43.</page><page sequence="27">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 303 manifests itself in the speed of the motion, we also come across something qualitative, i. e., the direction of the motion to a goal. It is probably on account of this finalistic theory that Burkamp105 honors Sapper with the epithet of a "consequent psychovitalist." This only shows that the critic still holds to the old fallacy, so common among the mechanists, that the concept of finality always implies a reaction consciously directed towards a goal. Sapper, in stead, points out explicitly that a final act and a consciously pur poseful act are two very different things. The reason, Sapper pro ceeds, why a natural process is teleological lies in the fact that the bearer of the process is a reaction-unit, because acting is always a process that is directed towards a goal.106 Despite the many partial operations we find one dominating feature which we should con ceive as the goal of the whole process. Then of course, the problem arises how a reaction-unit should be explained. Sapper turns against all those vitalists and neovitalists who separate too much the prin ciple of force and that of matter. They conceive of matter as some passive material reality to which is added another active reality, namely, force, which acts upon the former. Sapper rejects such a view because it is inconceivable.107 It is impossible, he urges, to think of matter as of a merely passive principle which would exist independently of force for the following reason: Anything we know of an object depends on its mediate or immediate reaction upon our senses. Therefore on the supposition that there would exist a purely passive principle, we would be unable to know it, because a thing that does not "act" is for us not "actual," i. e., real. But as soon as it acts in any way — through pressure touch, light reflection, etc. — it is no longer merely passive. Consequently it is inconceivable that passive matter exists independently of force. Hence, Sapper con cludes, matter and force form one and the same reality whose passive aspect we designate as matter, and whose active aspect we denote as force. And thus we must consider the one reaction unit both as the substrate and as the cause of its operations. The question follows: Are these reaction-units "Gestalten" or natural bodies? They are, according to Sapper, the electrons, atoms, 105. Naturphilosophie der Gegenwart (Berlin, 1930), p. 45. 106. Phil, des Organischen, pp. 77 et seq. 107. Phil, des Organischen, pp. 73 et seq.</page><page sequence="28">304 FRANCISCAN STUDIES molecules, crystals, cell-tissues, organs, and finally the organisms. The author considers them as ever higher "Gestalten" which are qualitatively more than the sum of their parts because each of them shows Gestalt-qualities which are only proper to the unitary whole as such. The last and lowest reaction-units are, according to him the elements out of which all higher units are constituted. The elements are equipped with forces and qualities which unfold themselves only when matter is arranged into a new orderly state, in other words, when a new "Gestalt" comes into existence. Seeing that "Gestalten" exist also in inorganic nature, we arrive at the final question, whether there is a difference between them and the organic ones. Sapper answers the question with an un qualified yes; life shows characteristic differences from the inani mate. He stresses especially the difference of the former from crystals which are the only inorganic "Gestalts" that grow as an organism does, through assimilation. Despite this similarity there is, however, an essential difference, because a crystal is a typical aggre gate or summation, and an organism not only shows the capacity to assimilate but also to differentiate — a feature entirely missing in the crystal. As for an evaluation of Sapper's system, any one who knows the Aristotelic-Scholastic theory will acknowledge a remarkable agreement in many points between this and the former. There is, however, also a fundamental disparity. Sapper does not belong to the hylemorphistic school. He is certainly right in emphasizing the principle that in a material substrate we should not separate matter and force, but he loses sight of the value of distinction. He is wrong in contending that matter and force are one and the same reality, distinguished only by our way of conceiving them. According to our philosophy, matter and force are two co-principles in reality distinguished, but forming one compound, namely, the one sub stance. Sapper's final criterion for the difference between matter and force is not that they are really different, but that we should con sider or rather represent them as different. At this point some posi tivism shows through in the author's theory. In his explanation for the higher "Gestalten" out of the elements, some sort of merism — although very much tempered — still ap</page><page sequence="29">PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE THEORIES 305 pears. This is obviously a consequence of the fact that he has not fathomed the depth of the fundamental principle of Aristotelean hylomorphism, namely, that matter is in potency to any form. Ac cording to Aristotle and most Scholastics, only one form is actual; matter may lose, under influence of external factors, this actual form, but by that very fact a new form is actualized out of matter's poten tiality. Sapper, however, puts in each one of the composing parts of the organism something actual of that which it is to become later, and thus he again cuts the organism's unity to pieces. Finally Sapper does not do justice to the spiritual element in man. The last life theory which we have to mention as an example of immanent vitalistic holism is the one we first dealt with viz., ani mistic substantialism of the Aristotelic-Scholastic tradition. Because of its traditional character, it is both old and new as well as sup ported and confirmed by the newest data of experimental research work. It still holds true. This theory we have already outlined in the beginning of this article. James Van der Veldt, O. F. M. St. Joseph's Seminary, Yonkers, N. Y.</page></plain_text>
