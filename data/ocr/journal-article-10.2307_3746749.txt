<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY to heal. A natural religious idealism, on the other hand, can make itself felt throughout the whole social life of man, for it would accept "the responsi- bility of conserving, transmitting, rectifying, and expanding the heritage of values we have received," and this provides the elements for a religious faith, unconfined to sect, class, or race, which "has always been implicitly the common faith of mankind." Liberal theologians, at any rate, will agree with much that Professor Dewey contends for, but while they are themselves critics of certain ideas of the supernatural they will think that in rejecting every form of Theism he has thrown out the baby with the bath. Surely it is not true that "all that an Existence (of God) can add (to ideals) is force to establish, to punish, and to reward" (p. 44), since the mode of God's action belongs, according to most Theists, to another order, namely, that of rational persuasion. And is it quite as certain, as Professor Dewey thinks, that all forms of religion in which there is a reference to a Being transcending the world even though immanent in it, distract human energy? At any rate, a unification of the self, an enhancement of its power, and a deepened sympathy with all human concerns, is claimed by those-and they are many even to-day-whose experience is strongly controlled by such an idea. However that may be, Professor Dewey would welcome all who shared his Common Faith, even if they went beyond it, and, much as he criticizes the churches, he is willing to assign them a function-provided they become socially minded-in the regeneration of society. The questions on which debate will be aroused by this book are always important living issues in moder life-a fact which shows the value of Professor Dewey's book as a stimulus to thought. A. E. ELDER. Reason. A Philosophical Essay with Historical Illustrations. By THOMAS WHITTAKER. (London: Cambridge University Press. I934. PP. 217. Price ios. 6d.) In this volume the distinguished author of The Neo-Platonists has gathered together contributions to philosophy which he has made over a period of more than twenty-five years. They comprise (in order of date) the account of the philosophies of Comte and Mill and Schopenhauer written for the series Philosophies Ancient and Modern in I908 and I909 respectively; the article on "Reason" from the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (I918); and the discussions on "Vico's New Science of Humanity," contributed to three numbers of Mind in I926, and on "Transcendence in Spinoza," which appeared in the same journal in I929. These are prefaced by a shorter Introduction in which the author links together the discourses which follow and expresses his own philosophical confessio fidei. Hegel is right to place "conscious philosophizing beyond religious faith as the way in which man disinterestedly contemplates the universe." "If a final philosophy shall come, we may look forward to it as destined to be in the future more unquestionably the queen of the sciences than theology ever succeeded in being in the Middle Ages. This, however, must be entirely by free consent, not by a cunning or violent bending of the will to the purposes either of a select few or of a dominant many." Many who remain uneasy at the royal prerogatives assigned to philosophy will emphatically endorse this last sentence, while dissenting (perhaps) from the severe criticism of medieval thinkers which it may be held to imply. Readers of philosophical literature will welcome the opportunity given 236</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS here to read Dr. Whittaker's shorter writings in a single compendious volume. By the same token, as they have all been published before, some a generation ago, comment seems here not to be called for. I shall content myself with a very brief, though a very grateful, notice. The essay on "Reason" is placed first of the reprinted papers, and the remaining chapters are, according to the sub-title of the book, "illustrations" of it. They are in fact both more and less than this. The reader is not, I think, left with the impression that a single thesis has been illuminated by a succession of "illustrations." But that is because the author has not presented the thinkers under review from a single (over-simplified) standpoint. His fairness and breadth of sympathy is indeed proved by his appreciative treatment of philosophers as diverse and as mutually incompatible as Comte, Schopenhauer, and Spinoza. In his opening pages he has something to say of the characteristics of English philosophy; these chapters are a good example of that un-doctrinaire and comprehending sympathy which is perhaps specially a quality of English philosophical criticism at its most humane. If one of the discussions may be selected for separate mention, let it be the last, in which Dr. Whittaker, writing of Spinoza, repudiates the view, so popular in certain quarters abroad, that the chief significance and dominant note in Spinoza's system is to be found in its determined naturalism. The parallels he here adduces between some of Spinoza's utterances and some culled from Bruno and Neo-Platonism are of particular interest. But (if it is not ungrateful to close on a more carping note) I do not think justice can be done to either Comte or Mill if they are run, as here, in double harness. And Dr. Whittaker's estimate of Schopenhauer strikes one as altogether too generous. But it is the kindly English way to admire wrong- headedness if only it is uncompromising enough. J. W. HARVEY. The Behaviour of Animals: An Introduction to its Study. By E. S. RUSSELL, O.B.E., D.Sc., F.L.S. (London: Edward Arnold &amp; Co. I934. PP. viii + I84. Price Ios. 6d.) No science in its inception was ever so richly endowed with subject-matter as was animal psychology, and no endowment could have proved more cumbrous to deal with or more inhibitory to the proper arrangement of an organized branch of knowledge. A wealth of information about the ways of animals, a ready general interest shown by almost everybody in the subject, and an almost inevitable anthropomorphic bias of most observations and interpretations, have always acted as a hindrance to the steady, orderly, and unified growth of a system of scientific generalizations derived from controlled observation and experiment. As a result there is no one science of animal psychology. The more unscientific methods of the naturalist still obtrude themselves into the subject, and laboratory workers still occasionally react to anthropomorphic intrusions by simple mechanistic theories incapable of justification. It is not surprising, therefore, that the subject is open to criticism on many fronts. Dr. Russell's new book is a more searching and a far more responsible indictment than animal psychology usually receives. The terms of his con- demnation will become clearer if his proposals for its improvement are first considered. What he in effect says is: (a) Animal psychology should be abandoned by those trained in the experimental study of behaviour, and handed over to zoologists; (b) all animal activity is linked together within 237</page></plain_text>
