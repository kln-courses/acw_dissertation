Ask people here about her and you'll just get a blank look."96 Finally, the late Gene DeGruson, former curator of the Haldeman-Julius Col lection at Pittsburg State University, kept the history of Girard alive in the library, but the town of Girard itself has seen no resurgence of interest.97 It is in turning to current social issues that one finds the most prominent vestiges of the freethought movement in its prime. There has been a rise in secularism since the "Golden Age of Freethought." This secularism has not so much manifested itself in organized move ments as in a change of attitude among many people. Some churches themselves have also undergone reform, becoming more open to nonliteral or metaphorical biblical interpre tation and integrating freethought-like ideas of ethics, toleration and overall liberalism into their teachings. Old social issues important to freethinkers, such as freedom of speech and the press, women's rights, sexuality, and sci entific rationalism are still as much debated today as they were a hundred years ago. It must be concluded, then, that many freethink ers still exist, in Kansas and in the world.98 These liberals are not as easily identified as they might have been in the past, given the absence of a proliferation of freethought newspapers and organizations, but their ideol ogy continues to influence society. Ultimately, where free inquiry is championed, freethought lives. Notes 1. Samuel Porter Putnam, Four Hundred Years ofFreethought (New York: Truth Seeker Co., 1894), p. 505. 2.
