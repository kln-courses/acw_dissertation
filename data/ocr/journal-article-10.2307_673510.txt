<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Science of Humanics: Multidisciplinary Renaissance of General Anthropology ELIOT D. CHAPPLE Rockland Research Institute Orangeburg, New York Discussions of the scope and proper definition of anthropology make it worthwhile to outline why and how anthropology can be treated as a natural (and exact) science. The paper describes its multidisciplinary components and how the deterministic properties of biological individuality and the probabilistic constraints of the cultural dimensions can be brought together. Such a synthesis enables us to treat values within a biological framework and suggests the old term "humanics" for the multidisciplinary nexus. [anthropological biology, humanics, multidisciplinary synthesis, interaction measurement, behavioral biology ] IN THE SEARCH for a solution to the ambiguities in the use of the term anthropology there is a continuing dilemma for those who take refuge in metaphysical constraints, most recently A. N. Whitehead's "onward and upward" evolutionism used by J. W. Bennett (1976) in his paper, "Anticipation, Adaptation, and the Concept of Culture in Anthropology." This is intended to bridge the presumed gulf between natural science and culturalistic phenomena to be seen in anthropology, the social and historical disciplines, and, for that matter, in literature and the humanistic studies. Even my own adoption of the term anthropological biology, i.e., the general biology of individual human beings and their relations to one another in the exact science sense (not a substitute term for biological or physical anthropology), is not sufficiently explicit. The difficulty is that most biologists, in departments of biology at least, rarely include man as part of the animal kingdom. Medical biologists, on the other hand, are too much concerned with disease and particular entities in developing understandings which can lead to improvements in practice. By contrast, anthropologists pay lip service to biological foundations, but in their writings and practice, the animal is left out. Eliot D. Chapple ELIOT D. CHAPPLE, a Yankee from Salem and Marblehead, received his Ph.D. in anthropology at Harvard in 1933. As an undergraduate he participated in the Newburyport ("Yankee City") study with Lloyd Warner. His field studies of U.S. social systems continued with the Harvard Medical School, Graduate School of Business, and School of Public Health collaborative program best known for its study of Western Electric's Hawthorne Plant. Chapple began at this time to develop techniques of measuring and recording micro- and macro- interactions, along with the incorporation of general biology into an interdependent system of biochemistry, physiology, and observable patterns of skeletal muscle behaviors. Collaborating with psychiatrists and neurophysiologists his consultative and research work concentrated on organizational systems in business and government. Chapple played a major role in the founding of the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1941. He became a Principal Research Scientist at Rockland State Hospital in 1961, working on rehabilitation techniques for adolescent sociopaths and psychopaths. For several years, from 1966 on, he was also a visiting professor at Cornell, with seminars in interaction theory. 42</page><page sequence="2">Chapple] THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS 43 Thus, when an investigator necessarily calls for aid on many disciplines over many years in forging a multidisciplinary and exact science understanding of the human condition, it is hard to avoid becoming self-conscious and sometimes speechless when repeatedly asked to apply a label to one's work, anthropology, given the contexts of the accepted academic categories by which this subject is usually interpreted. In my case, my interests and researches include, as one element, the treatment and rehabilitation of the "emotionally" ill-psychotics, sociopaths, psychopaths, psychoneurotics, and sufferers from psychosomatic disorders. More important, I believe that we must also investigate (for themselves as well as for comparison with the ill) the great range of individualities which the term "normal" purports to cover. But human beings live in organizational environments, the individualized niches which make each person's world his own ecological reality. Hence we conduct inquiries into the dynamics of family systems, of business and government organizations (and all others), giving equal concern to executives as well as to those at the bench or desk. This whole network to which we refer so casually as "community," "nation," or "the world" is built on the interplay of the individualities of identifiable (and separable) personalities. Each has its own dynamics; each is constrained by the cultural (including technological) dimensions of their group. To transform this to scientific understanding, you have to add genetics, physiology and neuroendocrinology, biochemistry and psychophar- macology, ecology and zoology (fortunately these last two are beginning to be conjoined in behavioral biology) and, above all, mathematics. So if, politely, you tell the curious, "I am an anthropologist," you can see why the task of explaining what stereotypes this label does not fit can easily leave the interrogator confused and the investigator launched into lengthy and tiresome explanations. THE PROBLEM OF LABELS In the late 1930s and early 1940s, some of us believed that anthropology (my formal degree) was a general science broad enough to include all these others. It has its foothold in "biology" through physical anthropology. It held to the premise that man was an animal; his behaviors biologically grounded. Like the psychiatrist and psychologist, but in different ways, we dealt with the individual personality. We extended this understanding to the study of people in groups-their social structure and social organization-along with sociologists, political scientists, and some economists or, more accurately, economic historians, like Robert K. Lamb. Above all, we tried to isolate and define the all-pervading influences of culture-those learned habits of man, exemplified in technology, language, economics, law, the arts, religion, and the like-which are built on these human (and biological) foundations (Chapple 1940, Chapple and Coon 1942). Yet time moves on. The academic explosion in buildings, numbers of students, and faculty has made for extreme scholastic instability. Although faculty departments cling to their power, the sanctity of "specialization" has been carried so far that each person frantically tries to pick out and hold on to his own territory, thus free "to do his own thing," with no one to say to him nay. Today, anthropology has become just another academic discipline with an almost infinite number of sub-sub-specialities to take refuge in. Coincidentally, a host of other specialities dealing with man has arisen, partitioning the supposedly related fields of the "social" or "behavioral sciences." Even the notable and popular attempt at synthesis provided by ethology is rapidly becoming subdivided. In zoology and ecology, the old sociobiological sections have merged into the Animal Behavior Society. Yet for all the present fashion for "naked apes" and the like, ethology and animal behavior are still pretty much limited to the lower animals.</page><page sequence="3">44 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 So, too, in anthropology, what was once called the "primitive," now a tabu word except among Freudians, was used to refer to the study of all non-European cultures. The fixation, if not the term, still remains predominant. The fascinations of the field trip to Borneo or the Highlands of New Guinea far outweigh, in academic kudos, Appalachia or Harlem, although these are sometimes admitted to have "relevance" (for others), by contrast to Scarsdale or Winnetka. In psychology, the drive for differential status has let loose a torrent of "subspecialities," one of the latest being "community psychology." Although one might smell imitation of "community psychiatry"-another newcomer-both are consistent in ignoring what sociologists, anthropologists, and historians have learned about communities from their beginnings as disciplines. Hence they can start afresh without endangering their personal territories. As a countertrend, many psychologists appear indistinguishable from, and say they are happiest with, geneticists, neurophysiologists, and even psychiatrists, depending on their bent. Psychiatry, the theology of this century par excellence, has also undergone fascinating splits. There are the multifarious "schools" deriving from the founders and their disciplines, each with slight, cultist variants to justify their "thing." More interesting is the attempt to take over larger and larger territories through the "social" or "community" psychiatries. More relevant, pushed by the discovery of psychoactive drugs and their medical implications, biochemistry and physiology are creeping in under the door. Unfortunately, attempts to label the totality, a need dimly perceived by some, have resulted in the coining of portmanteau words like "biopsychosociology," too awkward for easy acceptance. Such terms imply a conglomerate of disciplines, not the dynamic synthesis Grinker (1969) intended. Finally, in all this m6lange of searching for an integration which would unify all these tiny idiosyncratic niches so tightly clutched by investigators, there are many who preach the ultimate need to include "values" and thus to destroy any formulations of a "new synthesis." Without thinking very clearly about what they assume are the "givens," they ignore (or would if they were familiar with it) the position of Mr. Justice Holmes (1963:286), in brief rebuttal to a letter from Harold Laski: Your remark about the "oughts" and system of values in political science leaves me rather cold. If, as I think, the values are simply generalizations emotionally expressed, the generalizations are matters for the same science as other observations of fact. If, as I sometimes suspect, you believe in some transcendental sanction, I don't. Of course different people, and especially different races [he means cultures, EDC], differ in their values-but these differences are matters of fact. Today, many self-called scientists try to support Laski (unknowingly) by arguing that values, and the ethics and moralities by which they are expressed, are untouchable by the methods of the exact sciences. Thus points can be scored for the humanities. Alternatively, they take the position that the "science" of man must be a nonscience (in the exact science sense). By private revelation, there must be different rules by which the game is to be played, a belief strongly held by the philosophical sociologists. On this I shall comment later. THE APPROPRIATENESS OF "HUMANICS" If we are serious about developing a truly encompassing science of the relationships of humans to one another and to their environments, it would be remarkably helpful to get around the artificialities of compounded terms or conjoint phrases like behavioral anthropology or behavioral biology. What we need is a single term to describe this science with which so many are involved, one way or another. It happens that there is such a word at hand-"Humanics"--unused, largely unknown, lying fallow in the Random House Dictionary, the OED, and even in Webster II, where it is</page><page sequence="4">Chapple] THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS 45 simply referred to as "the study of human nature." A more extended definition is the study of "human nature or human affairs" (Webster III). The affairs of men and their understanding are broad enough to cover all those elements of the various disciplines which need to be included in this multidisciplinary unification so painfully emerging. In a recent book of mine, Culture and Biological Man (Chapple 1970a), I listed and used in my synthesis some 20 separate disciplines and subdisciplines. I by no means exhausted the enumeration (and utilization), since the cultural dimensions alone multiply inordinately the number of specialities bearing on a particular problem. Moreover, such a simple term, like humanics with its etymological parallels in economics (and ethics), is far more likely to signify the study of the human condition than new and arbitrary linguistic constructs, taken from the Greek, like synpraxiology. True, humanics is that abomination of the old scholars, a Latin-Greek compound, like sociology, but the latter term has become accepted in spite of protests from the purists. These days, there are few with more than a passing familiarity with Latin or Greek, thanks to the new look in higher education. Again, there may be complaints from the humanities, jealously guarding their territories against scientific trespass. Still, in the end, the growth of knowledge should be beneficial to their own concerns. The practitioner of humanics becomes a humanicist, close perhaps to humanist but, at least, those in the humanities regard "humanist" as a philosophical or quasi-religious term, and not their proper designation. WHAT HUMANICS DEALS WITH Now what is the science of humanics as it presently exists? With what class of phenomena does it concern itself and what kinds of uniformities are already evident? In the first place, the common thread in all these inquiries is clearly the relationships of individuals to one another. In the late 1930s when I first began to write about our work in measuring the interactions of people, that word was rarely used in the literature. Over the years, parallel to the development of interaction measurement, first in humans and then cross-species, it has become subject to a terminological Gresham's law. Though largely ignoring the scientific findings, interaction is taken to cover a spectrum ranging from the philosophical sociologists, like Goffman, Reisman, and Parsons, to the interpretative guides to the human dilemmas of the more popular prophets, though now, "does he relate?" or "transactionism" and more sexy equivalents seem to be more saleable synonyms. But forgetting the vagaries of usage, humanics deals with the interaction of individuals, not merely in special contexts like psychotherapy or small unstructured groups, but in complex organizational systems like giant corporations, nations, and their emerging combinations. In addition, and most important, it is built on the interactional properties of the individual, their genetic, biochemical, and physiological substrates. It treats the ways in which the individuality of each personality is shaped by the interplay and mutual influences of one individual on another, from the earliest demonstrable event, before as well as after birth. But humanics is more than the isolation of a class of phenomena-the interactions of individuals; it consists of a set of operations, in the exact science sense, by which measurements are obtained of the interaction patterns themselves. These are purely quantitative; the primary operations are time durations (and thus frequencies) and yield interchangeable units which are isomorphic with arithmetic (Chapple 1971). Since we have no alternative except to build on biological foundations, interaction patterns are defined not merely "behaviorally," another presently debased term, but on the observable contractions and relaxations of muscle systems through which responses to others are mediated-the "fixed" action patterns of the ethologists, which are species-specific. The</page><page sequence="5">46 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 quotation marks around "fixed" are intended to emphasize the point that these sequences are modified in the timing and magnitude of each component through habituation or "learning," but not in the sequencing order itself. They include both verbal and what are now called nonverbal "communications," which by no means encompass all of interaction itself. THE DETERMINISTIC PROPERTIES OF BIOLOGICAL INDIVIDUALITY What transforms these patterns and their occurrence, and provides the repertoire of interactions, are their rhythmic properties. Biological rhythms include the longer circadian rhythms, 24+ hours; the shorter, faster rhythms which make up the actual interactions of two or more people and associated physiological events-respiration, heart rate, etc.; and the somewhat longer intradian rhythms, as I call them, which control the occurrence and temporal durations of these interactional events. (Though menstrual, circannual, and perhaps longer cycles are relevant, I exclude their discussion here.) All of these can be described mathematically as relaxation oscillators, the coupling of which, through central and autonomic nervous system mechanisms, produces transients, disturbances in the parameters of the oscillators (the wave forms), as each person's rhythms endeavor to predominate or at least adjust to the other's. This coupling, this interposition of an external rhythm, is called the entrainment process (Chapple 1970b). It sets in motion autonomic-skeletal muscle systems reactions which we loosely call "emotional" in everyday speech. The intriguing (and valuable) property of relaxation oscillators mathematically, in spite of their nonlinear properties, is the rapidity with which they shift the parameters of their cyclical patterns. Each relaxation cycle can be thought of as a period of energy charge (inaction or "silence") and discharge (action), working like a capacitor in your TV set. They are thus quite unlike pendulums or the regular harmonics of sound. Given the mathematical properties of these biological rhythms or clocks, both the interactions of two people (a pair or dyad) and the complex networks of relations which make up business or government organizations can be treated as systems of nonlinear differential functional equations. The term "functional" in mathematics, not social science, refers to systems where changes in the parameters of the system are irreversible, often called "hereditary," though they may be environmentally produced (Volterra 1959). In hysteresis, for example, cumulative shifts in the parameters have taken place which limit the degree to which a return to the prior state can be achieved. Twist a copper wire too tightly, and molecular changes are produced which no longer give it the flexibility or ductility of the original (or an equivalent) piece of wire. In the interactional case, the changes are hormonal and neurophysiological, directly evidenced by quantitative changes in the interaction rhythms. Thus, thresholds and reaction patterns can shift under the hammer blows of other personalities and achieve a new "personality" which, as with the schizophrenias, say, is remarkably resistant to change. Hence the significance of this formulation of the rhythmic properties of the individuality in terms of coupled relaxation oscillators, remembering that even the largest social systems are so composed, is that it provides us with a deterministic set of equations, describing each individual and his interactions. THE PROBABILISTIC DIMENSIONS OF THE CULTURE IN WHICH WE LIVE Though we can demonstrate scientifically that an interactional event between two people, once it occurs, works itself out lawfully, we still don't know with certainty whether or not the two will or will not happen to meet. We can describe each individuality as fixed in mathematical terms, with their rhythms, their thresholds to disturbances carried with them,</page><page sequence="6">Chapple] THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS 47 and their differential effects on others depending on their own dynamic equilibrium states. Yet people are not isolated, they have to interact, and contacts between them may or may not occur. Thus chance (those limitations on "the best-laid plans") makes our networks of relationships to specific others not deterministic. The events constituting them occur over time as a matter of probability. To expand our analysis beyond the individual, we have to identify and define the components of the probabilistic factors which make up what we variously call culture, technology, social organization, or structure. These are all necessarily included in the concept of culture as the totality of learned patterns of the individual and the "group." So, for each of the components of the organizational structures and their complex combinations which make up the environmental network of each person, we have to estimate (calculate from observation) the probabilities in numerical terms. By contrast to Newton's overall conceptual framework, in humanics the dynamics of each individual's moment-to-moment interactions can be formulated as fully deterministic systems, yet, at the same time, we have to estimate the probabilistic values for the occurrence of these events between people to describe complex systems. If this distinction may seem obscure, keep in mind that the reason that each individual organism can be efficiently described as a deterministic set of functional equations, however complex, is a consequence of the fact that each person is a self-contained (in mathematical terms) biochemical and physiological system. These equations are built on the biological rhythms (clocks) which make all of us, so to speak, prime movers (free will!). A human being is no passive Skinnerian animal, without genetic substrates, waiting for the external stimulus to start it off, like winding up the key on a child's toy to get its mechanism moving. Moreover, the biological system which each of us presents, and of whose functions nonscientists are only dimly aware, is in a state of dynamic equilibrium constantly liable to potentially rapid shifts in rates of the constituent oscillators. For each organism to be a system, it has to preserve its biochemical and physiological balance against internal or external forces within limits it can tolerate. Otherwise, it will die or undergo irreversible changes in its system balance. THE CULTURAL DIMENSIONS Like it or not, the interactional networks centered on each of us are strongly shaped by what we call the cultural world. They impose constraints (limits) on our interactional patterns because they depend on sensory inputs, biologically grounded, each of which has dimensional form. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, as well as the factors of reactivity, beat, muscle movement, and the like, are explicitly and operationally definable, though we may think it hard to make the jump from the architecture of a building to biology. For each cultural dimension we can identify, we need to estimate the specific probabilities that interaction will or will not occur between any two or more particular individuals in particular cultural situations, for how long, and in what patterns or synchrony and asynchrony. Fortunately, there is a biological basis on which each of the constituent cultural dimensions is constructed. This enables us to compute and assign probabilities, often compound, to each context of situation, and thus to the interactions which may (or may not) occur within it. Probabilistic may sound too abstract and statistical. Yet all we mean is, how do we guesstimate the chances that two people will meet and interact in particular ways? The deterministic equations of each individual tell us that if they do interact, i.e., he didn't miss the train or she find out that she can't leave her job when she thought she could, we have exact laws to describe the functional effects of their rhythms on one another.</page><page sequence="7">48 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 For more exposition on the cultural dimensions, Culture and Biological Man (Chapple 1970a) gives a reasonably clear and simple account, but we can use here as illustration the dimension of spatial distance. We can easily measure in feet or inches the physical distance which separates two people. Often we need to do this in three dimensions. We are well aware that relative height plays an important part in structuring many interactional situations (as in a church service or public meeting). The sensory limitations of each species also mean that visual and aural information decreases in impact the greater the distance apart, probably as a power function of the distance. Think how far a hawk can see in comparison to ourselves, while the mole snuffles his blind course in his tunnel underground. All living things differ in the strength and acuity of sight or hearing or smell. Hence, the pattern, and even the amount of interaction manageable, between two people, is very different if they are 100 ft. apart, instead of three ft. Being in literal physical contact (zero distance) introduces a third modality, the tactile (supplemented by the olfactory). Intensity of response and the degree to which subtle quantitative patterns are discriminated vary as a function of spatial distance. Remember that tactile contact may not set interaction going. Two people can lie together in bed, actually touching yet without interacting, but the probability estimates that they will are, of course, extremely high. THE DEPENDENCE OF "PRACTICAL" DISCIPLINES ON HUMANICS The fascinating thing to contemplate, in considering humanics, is the remarkable range of the practical or engineering disciplines which have been developed around it with their own logics. Although they should include the laws of humanics, yet how often are they regarded as independent of the human beings on which they are built? Select only one or two cultural dimensions, with some complexity. Each has inadvertently spawned a whole set of specialities and professions, usually ignoring the situational (environmental) probabilities which serve as constraints on whether two or many people will interact and with what rhythms and patternings. These probabilities also affect the changes in rates of occurrence of given frequencies, durations, and complexities of adjustment. From spatial distance, one can list architecture and landscape design as illustrative. Hence, all sorts of practical (political and economic) questions-about housing, urban transit, land use, etc.-must be rooted in the scientific formulations of humanics, both as applied and basic science. Other cultural dimensions sequence human activities into a regular order or rhythm, easiest seen in the division of labor in work situations, like the flow of material or paper or people in the interactions by which an organization-business or government-operates (incorporating the dimensions of spatial distance, of course). Such sequencing (and spacing) is also at work in rituals and ceremonies, with all their "apparent" cultural diversity. As a consequence, a host of other disciplines comes under the aegis of humanics. Finally, and most relevant to generality, the very symbols by which the cultural contexts are designated, separated, and associated with the interactional rhythms of individuals and the autonomic (emotional) components they carry with them, have a dimensional order. Symbolic (or configurational) "distance" can then be established by positioning their referents in ordinal array. This is not "structuralism" in the Levi-Strauss sense; it is a straightforward and particularistic analysis by the processes of general semantics, regarding each symbol as, at bottom, idiosyncratic in meaning. Useful mathematical approaches have recently been developed (Uttley 1970) to describe how symbols emerge from successive situational contexts and have dimensional impact, following the early analyses of Malinowski (1927) and Chapple (1940). Remember also that all of these many disciplines, applied or basic, have developed their own logical structures: economics, architecture, linguistics, law, and production engineering are obvious examples. What has been ignored, and yet in the last analysis plays the decisive</page><page sequence="8">Chapple] THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS 49 role in our lives, is that they all should be built on assumptions about how human beings work, how people adjust both to each other and to the physical and man-made environments in which they live. Hence, these disciplines must be based on the uniformities which humanics provides. In reality, however, human individuality, in most cases, is swept under the rug. The designers of buildings or assembly lines postulate the "Average Man," while educators, therapists, and counselors make only the most unreliable of distinctions (IQ, psychiatric diagnosis, job skills), with no scientific interest in dealing with personal individuality. In some areas-like economics, history, perhaps less in political science-the modifications required to get the living human personality into the logics are fundamental. In others, say architecture, the logics should be much easier to adapt to the realities of human interaction, assuming architects accept human personality and not esthetics as their base. THE RELEVANCE OF VALUES IN THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS Thus from these multiple constituents, we can begin to see, with Mr. Justice Holmes, that when we are talking about values, or ethical, moral, or religious verities, they can indeed be built out of the emotional-interactional patterns of human beings. Reactions to interaction with someone with whose rhythms you cannot synchronize involve and set off intense disturbances of your dynamic states. If prolonged, they will severely disturb the rhythms and the autonomic (emotional) states which they carry with them. These distorted patterns are called transients in mathematical language. So we try, almost unconsciously, to avoid taking part in stress situations which are antipathetic to the maintenance of successful (and emotionally stable) adjustment. Either we minimize their occurrence or find alternatives whose autonomic components maximize our affectional (neuroendocrine) states. Specifically, and practically, these quantitative patterns provide an analytical framework which enables us to define operationally the symbolic forms our "feelings" adopt. "Attitudes," "sentiments," "morals," all those terms-substitutive, imprecise, but fashionable-are those we use to talk about values. Throughout history, the continuing efforts to identify and define these values within philosophy and theology, and now in many of the "social sciences," have been plagued by the unreal but perhaps flattering belief that they are Platonic absolutes. There is little understanding that these are properties of human beings, in particular cultural settings which have definable biological roots. For values deal with questions of good and evil, right and wrong, and all the extensions and elaborations to be found in moral and ethical codes. If we avoid the ambiguities of the tabus imposed by religious sanctions (e.g., not to ask questions, but rather to deal with values on their own grounds) we cannot avoid recognizing that their referents have to do with those states in the individual which facilitate autonomic-interactional adjustment (synchrony) with others or disturb each person's complex rhythms by the interposition of stress in the entrainment process (Chapple 1951, 1970a). And this is not merely a gross phenomenon or a verbal affair. The intricate interdependence of cortex and the "lower" centers which makes possible the finely tuned elaboration of interaction rhythms within the cultural dimensions is infinitely varied from one person to another. As Stanley Burnshaw (1970) insists, with Suzanne Langer (1967), about the esthetic process, "the body makes the minde," using John Donne's perceptive phrase as the banner for humanics. Thus patterns of interaction set up trains of sequential changes in the life network of relationships of an individual, a resultant of the interweaving of the rhythmic processes of all the individuals therein. This mutual dependence makes it possible for us to analyze the system mathematically in terms of the properties of dynamic equilibrium, that is, of the ways in which the autonomic-interactional rates (of the relaxation oscillators) influence one</page><page sequence="9">50 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 another. And the analysis, in a first approximation, is not difficult, though requiring special techniques to deal with nonlinear phenomena. Admonitions as to ethical or moral acts can be seen (and defined) as high-order abstractions which describe, or can be made to describe, the degree to which any given interaction pattern will create crises in the system, or in its individual members (Chapple 1940). Alternatively, as statements about what is "good," or what is to be regarded as "right conduct," they describe those biologically grounded patterns which eliminate or reduce the measurable severity of stress or increase the measurable well-being states of the individual. Thus the important thing to understand is that any pattern which underlies statements of values (or ethics or morals) can be measured and defined in terms of the parameters of a set of equations built on the underlying rhythms (and their disturbances) which control us all. To cling to the belief that values are prime movers is to fall again into Platonic transcendentalism; it assumes that high-order symbolic configurations cannot be built up out of the flow of microinteractional events which constitute the "seamless web" of each individual's experiential history (Burnshaw 1970). Values are both idiosyncratic and cultural. Thus, through the science of humanics, they are capable of precise analysis. OFF WITH THE OLD; IDENTIFY (OR BUILD) THE NEW More exciting, we can see how new values emerge, to fit new interactional contexts, and old ones disappear. As I commented long ago, the corporate and technological revolution of today requires a new morality, based on the human (moral) decisions which have to be made moment by moment. Society can never return to the ancient pastoral and agricultural technology whose interactional networks gave power to the then existing system of religious ethics. Chester Barnard (1957) said succinctly that "Judeo-Christian ethics seem to have little affiliation or relevance to the moral problems of the world of affairs." He went on to say, of meetings of churchmen which he attended, I observed that whenever the discussion related to public or business affairs, the assumption as to the nature of such affairs seemed to me quite unrealistic. Whenever an attempt was made to apply a moral precept, it seemed to me substantially irrelevant, and what seemed to me the essential moral dilemmas of business and public affairs were evidently not contemplated at all. In my own discussion of this problem, in the article from which the above quotations are taken (Chapple 1959), I suggested that this new morality can emerge and be scientifically grounded. We see even more poignantly today, in the light of present events, that we cannot try to solve the problems of an international, multicultural society with the limited ethical admonitions of a cultural world long since vanished into the past. Arguments to the contrary, adducing the validity of the prophets of old is necessarily based on a commitment to nonverifiability, supported by invocation of revelation from one source or another. This may be a convenient way of preserving philosophical and theological territoriality against the encroachments of science. To do so, however, the proponents of this "traditional" or nuministic point of view must valiantly ignore our present and rapidly growing knowledge of the remarkable capacities of the human animal. We now know he is superbly able to fine-tune the autonomic-interactional rhythms through the discriminatory media which cortical differentiation makes possible. It is worth noting that Ortega y Gasset (1957) said that man is not Homo sapiens, rather he is Homo insciens with evolution (sapiens) taking over only at those moments when man can rise above his fellow primates. For it is this differentiation of individuality which the analytical procedures of humanics have already demonstrated and which we can rapidly expand. By adopting a new and single term, a surprisingly large number of investigators who now feel isolated in traditional disciplines could build a common understanding of how what they are doing contributes to the science of the nature and the affairs of mankind.</page><page sequence="10">Chapple] THE SCIENCE OF HUMANICS 51 THE COMMON DENOMINATOR PROVIDED BY HUMANICS Thus humanics, as the inclusive and exact science of interaction, though we must not ignore its congruity with the rest of the animal kingdom by being over-influenced by its anthropomorphic title, provides a firm, and experimentally demonstrable, foundation for the old dream of the generalist. Many of us believed (and still do) that specialization necessarily must some day vanish, dissolved by the pressures of the multidisciplinary requirements without which any scientific understanding of the nature and the affairs of humanity is hopeless. We cannot be satisfied with the halfway house of interdisciplinary collaboration, the myth that the towers of Babel which each such enterprise constructs are somehow to be replaced with a neatly homogenized product. All experience, and certainly that of recent times, shows that whether we talk, with Lord Snow, about two worlds, or describe our research efforts as collaborative across disciplines, there is no common ground, no effective means, which an exact science provides, of destroying the dichotomies altogether. Humanics gives us this chance-without need for courtesies of subordination to the traditional disciplines. Its class of phenomena, the interaction of individuals, is clearly understood; its operations of measurement have been defined; and its theoretical structure makes it possible to synthesize biology (and all its relevant aspects ) with the many other researches which bear on the human condition, and their ultimate potentials for our lives. And most important, the study of man can become, in reality, part of an integrated study of the universe, without which we confront insuperable blocks in expanding our knowledge of the interrelations of scientific formulations. This is not reductionism in its present sense. What I am saying, therefore, is that there is a continuum, perhaps with operational jumps at system levels, which provides us our best hope for understanding living organisms and their ecological congeners as mutually dependent and environmentally integrated systems of functional dependence. In other words, we do not live as isolates but as part of a flow of energy where we may even stabilize, if not reverse, at least for a while, the hypothesized inevitability of entropy (Schridinger 1956).
