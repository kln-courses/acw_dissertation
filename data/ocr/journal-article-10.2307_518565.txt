<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Tanner Bede: The Old English Version of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica. Edited by JANET BATELY. Pp. 40+32 fac. pp. (Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile 24). Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1992. Bound, Da. kr. 10,450; paper, 9,250. This facsimile edition of the so-called Tanner Bede, the earliest manuscript of the Old English Bede, is the latest volume in the Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile series. The volume contains not only Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 10 itself, but also MS Tanner 10*, the manuscript's parchment fly-leaves, originally used as a mortuary roll, and London, British Library, Cotton MS Domitian A.ix fo. 11. The verso of this single leaf contains thirty-four runic symbols, along with their values in Anglo-Saxon script, and their names. On the recto are excerpts from material derived from the Old English Bede which may thus be its earliest witness; Janet Bately describes the leaf as looking more old-fashioned than Tanner 10 'in almost every respect', but acknowledges the particular difficulty of distinguishing between late ninth-century and early tenth-century origins. Tanner 10 was disbound for conservation when this edition was being prepared, so there is more detail about the physical state of the manuscript than usual, especially with regard to sewing and binding. The whole book, as well as manifesting damage from worm and binders, has been seriously damaged by damp, apparently by being immersed in water for some time. It seems likely, therefore, that Tanner 10 was one of the books belonging to Bishop Tanner which were sunk in the Thames near Wallingford and 'lay under Water 20 Hours, and received much Damage', according to the Gentleman's Magazine for January 1732. The book's history before this catastrophe is uncertain, but Bately argues that Tanner 10 may be the saxonice bede referred to in Robert Talbot's hand on the verso of Cotton Domitian A.ix fo. 11 as being in his possession. Talbot, a sixteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist who evidently had a special interest in Bede, owned other Old English manuscripts, including one from Thorney Abbey, a Benedictine house in Cambridgeshire which has generally been regarded as Tanner 10's medieval provenance--primarily because the mortuary roll which provided the manuscript's fly-leaves is that of William, Abbot of Thorney. Bately questions the assumption that Tanner 10 was moved to Thorney soon after its foundation-c.972-pointing out that the pastedowns in the manuscript need not necessarily have been incorporated at Thorney itself, and that fourteenth-century glosses in the text show that there was interest in the manuscript long after the Conquest, which might account for a late move. Nevertheless, she concludes that the theory of a Thorney connection is both 'highly attractive and extremely plausible'. From similarities in the style of the manuscript decorations with those of Junius 27, which is in turn related in its script to the Parker Chronicle, it has been supposed that</page><page sequence="2">250 REVIEWS Tanner 10 originated in Winchester, and was copied at the beginning of the tenth century. But Bately argues that the similarities in the decorated initials may be the result of decorators moving from one scriptorium to another, or even, given the notable uniformity and conformity of the decorations in Tanner 10, of reliance on a pre-prepared set of patterns. She concludes that the manuscript's place of origin must remain unknown. Tanner 10 is remarkable for its decoration, especially the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic initials, which are carefully and lucidly analysed in this volume; some are reproduced as colour plates. The texts of Tanner 10, with its complex sequence of five hands, and of Cotton Domitian A.ix fo. 11, are described in a detailed and thoroughly scholarly way, and the quality of the photographs is very fine indeed. This volume certainly conforms to the high standards set by the series as a whole. Linacre College Oxford HEATHER O'DONOGHUE</page></plain_text>
