<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIVE BASIC TYPES OF THEISTIC WORLDS IN THE RELIGIONS OF MAN BY ERNEST HARMS New York City, U.S.A. Any attempt to gain insight into the reasons for the multiplicity and variety of the religions that exist among the human beings who populate the earth confronts the confusing question of finding a basis for a classification of these religions. In the scientific literature on religion we find, in addition to those works that merely describe the contents of various religious systems, foremost works of psychological interpretation of many phases of religion and religious life. Although the latter have in recent decades grown to large proportions, they have, in the face of the large variety of contradictory psychological concepts, lefts us more confused than enlightened about man's relation to the theistic systems he has created and their meaning for him. Realization of this fact started this writer, about ten years ago, on a search for a basic aspect that might lead to an understanding of what might be called "types" of religion, which, he believed, should be seen at least as much sociologically as psycho- logically. We shall, therefore, in this treatise, bypass most of the con- fusing area of merely psychological interpretation, except to quote one clear-sighted scholar who in concise form has said all that it seems to this writer needs to be said in introducing the psychological point of view. Jane E. Harrison (43) wrote: "What man thinks about the 'theistic beyond' results in his theology or mythology; what he does in working out his relationship with the 'beyond' results in the rituals he follows; where his feelings and emotions are involved in his reli- gious life, his fears, hopes and loves, there is created his community life, the actual religious collective body." There is an identity between these three major phases of psychic dynamics and the triad of major sociological aspects valid for practically all religions: the theistic world.</page><page sequence="2">Ernest Harms the world of the priesthood, and the communal world of the wor- shipers (44). To clear the stage for the presentation of our interpretation we must first emphasize that most theological and psychological studies of religion give major attention to man's relationship to his gods, and only little to the content and functioning of the theistic systems as such. It is, however, in the structuring and functioning of his theistic worlds that man expresses the details of his religious impulses, needs, and desires. This theistic world is the center of man's total religious experience. Centeredness must therefore be considered the basic aspect in the sociology of religion (86). The concept of centeredness is not new to the wider field of an- thropology and the cultural sciences. Gustav Mensching (66) in his concept of "die Lebensmitte," the center of life, applied it in his inter- pretation of the sociology of religion. By "centeredness" we mean the focal point at which the major activities of a social group or organi- zation are centered and from which they emanate. Surveying a number of religions with regard to this point, we find that all fully developed religions have a centeredness in regard to the three major factors we have enumerated: the theistic world, the priesthood, and the com- munity of worshipers. It should be emphasized that almost all religions have a chief-centeredness in their theistic world toward which the worshiper reaches out for help. There are exceptions, however. Egyp- tologists (I3) (30) point out that the king-priest in ancient Egypt was in the religious sense more important than the gods themselves. In modern times a somewhat similar situation exists in the Roman Catho- lic form of Christianity, where the ordinary believer is denied the possibility of reaching any self-experience of the theistic world with- out the mediation of the clergy (92). This makes the clergy the real center of the Roman Catholic religious body. We also know of forms of religion, old and new, in which the center is the community of worshipers. This was true of the old Hinanyana Buddhism (I7), and, to cite a modern form, the Society of Friends, the Quakers (I5) (55).1) i) The first to apply, in nuclear form, a typology based on centeredness was Adolf Bastian (8). In a small monograph, Einiges aus Samoa (Something from Samoa) (Berlin, Duemmler, I889), he wrote: "The essential point here is in the psychological half of man's nature, and since we find his point of view inter- woven in all conceptions, reaching far beyond the planetary world, this psycho- logical aspect even became part of the collective thinking of the people...". 206</page><page sequence="3">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 207 The purpose of this treatise is to distinguish five types of religion, which comprise almost all known religions, on the basis of their different points of centeredness. This, of course, implies not only a difference in structure as between the theistic systems as such, but also a difference in the entire area of the religious experience of parti- cular groups of human beings. Application of the concept of centered- ness provides a solid element for an understanding of the great variety of religions and the enormous differences between them (30). Before we begin our presentation proper we must clear up two important points. The first concerns the use of the term "type"; the second concerns specification of the part of the theistic world best suited for our purpose and its relationship to the wider field of reli- gion (87). The term "type" in present-day scientific usage has become a basic tool for classifying certain phenomena in various natural and cultural fields. What do we mean when we speak of "types" of religion? Let us explain the concept of "type" by an example from natural science. Certain animals can live only under water. This is characteristic of these animals, and we therefore call them a species of animal desig- nated as fish. But there are different kinds of fish, some living in the sea, others in rivers or lakes. It is in this connection that we speak of this or that "type" of fish. "Type" is a term of specific differen- tiation. In the field of culture the situation is basically the same, al- though somewhat more complicated. First, there is what we call, gene- rally, religion. This may be described as the phenomena of human experience in the theistic sphere and the conditioning systems created by man for living with his gods. Man's religious experience has an autonomous character (65). Beyond this, however, there are a large variety of factors and relationships that must be dealt with in classi- fying the varieties of religion. In distinguishing types of fish there is a simple guide: whether the water they live in is salty or sweet. In the cultural field, and specifically in the field of religion, there are not only facts to be considered, but numerous relationships that may show sameness in the way that simple facts do. These relationships are primarily the object of what we designate religious types. Let us sum up the typological aspect: I. Man personalizes, in the form of a god or gods, his experiences</page><page sequence="4">Ernest Harms and his desires concerning the "beyond". This is an area in need of typological clarification. 2. Man has a need to standardize his relationship to his god or gods. He expresses this need by developing cults and rituals and by ap- pointing certain individuals to assume the function of implementing the rituals. The latter are the theistic mediators, or priests. In this area there is also great variety that calls for classification. 3. Religious impulses create in man a tendency to unite in groups either for the purpose of worship or for providing togetherness with his kind. Here, too, there is great variety calling for classification. To achieve a classification of these religious relationships we must find factors, functions, or relationships, autonomous for the religious field, the occurrence of which shows a sameness. 0. H. Mowrer (67), who has devoted much study to these problems, has pointed out that there exists "a logic of religious life and its processes." It is the ac- knowledgment of this logic upon which is based any scientific work in the field of religion and, therefore also, the identification of simi- larities which are the basis of any typology. In the face of the in- definiteness of the facts and relationships that must be covered, the next, and probably most important, question is: is there a limited area in the wider field of religion that may be specifically suitable as a basis of such a typological classification? It was Sir James Frazer (31) who noted the occurrence in practically every religion or mythology of a creation myth and its major importance in the indivi- dual religions. Others have followed Frazer in pointing to the unique importance of the creation myth (I) (I4) (91). Comparative obser- vations and a sense of generalization should make it not difficult to agree that the creation myth is a unique means of establishing a reli- gious typology that would cover practically all known religions (69). This writer has devoted years of study and observation to an attempt to establish a typology of theistic worlds. He has come to the con- clusion that five specifications of the wider relatedness of man would provide a solid and truthful basis for such an effort. That others might arrive at different conceptions is immaterial here. The five types of theistic world, as represented for the most part in their myths of creation, are: (I) the terrestrial; (2) the anthro- pomorphic; (3) the psychological; (4) the spiritual; (5) the cosmo- genic. 208</page><page sequence="5">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 209 The Terrestrial Type This concept implies a theistic world in which the center is located in and which views everything from the earth. According to a Chinese creation myth of the time of the Middle Kingdom, "the earth is a flat motionless disc upon which the heaven rests like a glass bowl cover. In the middle of this disc is located China and the Emperor's palace. The farther one goes from this center the less educated the people are and the less cultured is the world" (22). In this example the center is impressively seen. Such earthcenteredness may also in- clude celestial objects, such as the sun and the stars, but the latter are of a secondary character and are viewed, so to speak, in an earthly way. 2) That we point to such a terrestrial concept in Chinese mytho- logy does not mean that we believe all Chinese religions to be terrest- tial. A country as religiously rich as China has created a variety of types of religion in its thousands of years of history (60) (88). An intermingling of types of religion is to be found in practically all parts of the world. Among the American Indians, so rich in crea- tion myths, we find a number of the terrestrial type (I). The following is from a Kato Indian myth: The sandstone rock which formed the sky was old, they say.... Nagaitcho (the creator) and thunder walked on the sky. He made but flowers in the south, in the north he made a hole, and in the east he made coulds ... then the creator made man ... and splitting one of his legs, a woman... (38). From a Cherokee myth we have the following: The earth is a great island floating in the sea and suspended at each of the four cardinal points by a cord hanging down from the sky vault.... The water beetle dived to the depth, whence bringing up a bit of mud, from which the earth developed by accretion.... When the earth was dry and the animals came down, it was still dark. So they got the sun and set it in a track to go every day across the island from east to west just overhead (I). From the Navajo Genesis, which contains the most magnificent of these American Indian myths, we quote the following: The Age of Beginnings narrates the account of the progenitors of the Earth inhabitants from storey to storey of the Underworld and their final emergence upon Earth.... First Man and First Woman built the seven 2) They are given a terrestrial role, for example, to warm the earth, make plants grow, etc., and are not viewed as having any cosmic function. NUMEN XIII, 3 14</page><page sequence="6">Ernest Harms mountains of the Navajo land, one at each cardinal point and three in the centre.... The Sun Disk and the Moon Disk and the Stars were made by them and two men of the people were appointed to be the Sun-Carrier and the Moon-Carrier... (59). Frazer gives the following Eskimo terrestrial myth: In the center of the earth, which they reckon as the best place of all, they have fixed the residence of Torngarsuk and his granddame, or his lady daughter, a true termagent and ghastly woman, of whom it is said that she dwells in the lower parts of the earth under the seas, and has the empire over all fish and sea animals, as unicorns, mosses, seals, and alike... (32). The following creation myth from the island of Formosa has an unusual terrestrial trend: "Good is the island of Yami,'i said the god looking down at the flat world and dropped a big stone on the spot which is now the village of Ipaptok. The big stone fell upon Ipaptok and out of it burst a man. He was hungry when he first came out and ate the paptok, a bean-bearing plant. Then he walked down to the sea. He saw that a bamboo was growing by the sea, and as he watched, it split and out burst another man. "Who are we?" said one. "We are men," said the other. The son of the bamboo walked in the one direction and found silver. The son of the stone walked in another direction and found iron. They returned to their house and beat the hard iron and the soft silver. One day the right knee-joint of the son of bamboo swelled and itched and a boy child burst out of it; from the left knee-joint came a girl child. The same thing happened to the son of the stone (6I). Still another terrestrial myth comes from a South Pacific island: Quat was born on Vanna Lava, the very center of the world, and of what happened before that there is no tale. Quat was born from a bursting of a stone. His mother was a great stone that split in two and Quat came forth and named himself. He had no father; but he had eleven brothers. They all lived together in the village Alo and there the mother can still be seen, the huge stone that gave birth to Quat (7). From the Mexican Indians there is this terrestrial myth: The earth is the mother of universal life. She is the most compelling power of the universe. She is the supreme power. All others seem only part of her, or have proceeded from her depth. She is goddess of the wilderness and mistress of the forest. Her wrath is easily roused and she bestows her gifts only when she is pleased (37). In these terrestrial mythologies the most specific characteristic, it is seen, is that all that is presented occurs in threedimensional space. Not only the cosmos and the earth, but human life, are perceived thus. Another example of a terrestrial mythology is one whose designation 210</page><page sequence="7">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man as such will arouse energetic resistance. We refer to Roman mytho- logy, which is considered a derivative of Greek mythology. The re- lationship between them was doubtless close, and it is generally be- lieved that Roman culture at its height was more Greek than anything else. The question of this relationship hinges on the manner and amount of transference (50). Some of us may remember the fact of history, taught us in high school, that cultural transference often occurs in such a way that the politically conquered become the cultural con- querors of the politically victorious. This of course has been true in only a limited number of cases. We believe that there are different kinds of cultural transference, and we here introduce the view that some human groups may accept a foreign culture and permit it to replace their own, while others have such a strong relatedness to their own background that they assimilate or even change a culture or reli- gion that attempts to superimpose itself on theirs. Of course, there is hardly a field of religious activity as entangled as was that of an- cient Rome. Now, however, after a century of classical humanistic grecophily, more realistic and sounder cultural anthropologic points of view have come to the fore in the scientific study of cultural pro- cesses. In the mythological Testacio we have begun to separate the genuine from the false. John B. Noss (74) has given an excellent presentation of the religious shadow play on the sky supposedly owned by the Roman emperors. Going back to the era before the Greek in- vasion in a search for outside influences, he came upon the tribes that apparently inhabited the Italian boot from the dawn of time. He in- troduces us to an early farming population with an unusually strong utilitarian, animistic sense of existence. These Romulus-and-Remus founders of the original type of Roman religion had no sense or appreciation of the "vague Greek religious sentimentality." Recon- structing the original Roman theistic Pantheon, Noss shows it to have been the most terrestrial form of religion ever encountered. There were gods of farming, home-making, and child-rearing. There were gods of the woods, the fields, and the pasture, of the boundary-stone, the well, and the river. These early Roman gods were not "high gods," but genii and numen representing the powers of nature. As soon as the community became organized into a state, a priesthood was established, for the most utilitarian purposes, bringing magic or exor- cism to the people (28). When the Greek olympian gods landed on 21I</page><page sequence="8">Ernest Harms the Italian shore they were reduced to the terrestrial niveau. Zeus, the manifold Greek national spirit, became Jupiter, the "sky father," in charge of rain and sunshine, and his olympian family followed him down to this solid terrestrial ground. With the internationalization and decomposition of the Roman Empire, more and more foreign gods appeared on the Roman forum, without, however, making the deep impact that had the old Greek mythology (49). We learn from Ovid that the entire theistic sphere was nothing more than social habit and mental accomodation (77). What seems to have remained, however, as E. O. James (50) has so brilliantly shown, is the simple animistic basis of life in the form of a psychism of non-living existence, in the sense of Durkheim's formulation (25). It is the specific of all terrestrial mythology, or, in a wider sense, of most religions, that gods are directing forces behind and in earthly nature (5). In this sense animism is part of such a religious concept and appears almost every- where in connection with terrestrial religions. This is as true of a large number of American Indian and other primitive religions as it is of the aboriginal form of the religion of the Roman Empire. The writer must mention here still another of the major religions which in its basic and original form was, in his view, a terrestrial one. This is early Judaism (6). Yahweh, in the form originally presented by Moses, was a terrestrial god, definitely characterized as such in the Old Testament. To present this position clearly and in the neces- sary detail would be such a complicated matter that we felt we should refrain from using it as an example, especially in the framework of a sociological study (62). We should like, however, to refer here to Max Weber's intensive study of the people of the Old Testament (87). Weber's presentation may provide an indubitable confirmation of our contention that early Judaism was a terrestrial type of religion (52). The Anthropomorphic Type In applying the term "anthropomorphic" to our second type of theistic world, we must emphasize that the term is applied in a more limited sense than is today common in popular and scientific dis- cussion. The connotation here is somewhat in the sense of humanlike behavior, that is, the gods of the anthropomorphic theistic world no longer act in a godlike way, their world is one of human tragedy and comedy, and their "behavior" is all too human (78). 212</page><page sequence="9">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man One frequently finds in the literature an emphasis on Greek mytho- logy as a specific anthropomorphic mythology. This, in our view, is only to a certain degree accurate. We shall show later that it would be more accurate to call Greek mythology a specifically psychological one. Psychological behavior is, of course, part of the wider anthropo- morphic sphere, but in the more limited psychological sense it is more specific. A considerable number of major religions come within the anthro- pomorphic theistic world. Examples are Japanese Shintoism (go) and the Islamic (I8) and Nordic-Germanic (4) mythologies. Following are some excerpts from the Koijki (3), which is probably the largest of all creation myths. According to it, the world originated in the crudest way, and out of the most elementary facts of human existence: ... Three Kami [aboriginal deistic beings] appearing first, they were born without progenitors and later hid their bodies.... He-Who-Invites and She- Who-Invites, having become united as husband and wife, thus procreated the eighty countries, the eighty islands, and the eighty hundred myriad deities, with the Great-Eighty-Islands, land, the sea, the rivers, the mountains, the ancestor of the trees and the ancestor of the plants.... In giving birth to this child the vagina of She-Who-Invites was burned and she sickened with fever and lay down. From her vomit were produced two Kami... from her feces were produced two earth Kami.... Afterward, drawing his ten-hand- length sword, He-Who-Invites cut off the head of his child, Fire-Shining- Swift-Male, whose birth had caused her death (go). The world and all its details are created by man-like beings, and all parts of the world are created out of some part of the human body or human physical existence. Human physiogenesis is the belief of this theistic world. A major point in evaluating some mythologies is the place taken by the sun in the theistic system or mythology. It may be noteworthy that in the Japanese Koijki the birth of the sun occurs rather late, and cannot therefore have been a primitive factor. Shintoism, in the wider aspect, is a highly polytheistic religion, having over 2,500 deities. In its anthropomorphic character, however, Shintoism is not very different from Islamism, which has a monotheistic pattern. This of course gives Islamic anthropomorphism completely different features. In Islamism there is only one creator with no specific human traits, but everything that is, is created for man (I8). Islamism has there- fore been justly designated as a religion of brotherhood. Most scholars 213</page><page sequence="10">Ernest Harms have pointed to Islamism as a religion of laws and rules, not set as heavenly orders, but as orders for men to live by. In other words, it is anthropomorphic and seeks to make earthly life a "kingdom of men" under Allah's command (34). Monotheistic anthropomorphism is a rare form of religion, but Islamism has nevertheless become the religion of a "family" of millions. Islamism has no creation myth in the usual sense. At various places in the Koran, however, it is related that man was created from a clot of congealed blood. In Sura XXII it is said, "We have created you of dust, then of the moist germs of life, then of clots of blood, then pieces of flesh, shapen and unshapen, that we may give you proofs of our power." The facts that the creation of man is the only creation myth with which the Koran is concerned, and that blood seems to be the essential element, would further make it not too far- fetched to consider this a highly anthropomorphic creation myth (42). Nordic-Germanic mythology, as presented to us in the two Eddas, is a third form of anthropomorphic theism. The following are a few lines from the beginning of the poetic Edda: It was Time's morning - When Ymer lived - There was no sand - no sea - No cooling billows - earth there was none - no soft heaven - only Ginubgagap - but no grass - From Ymer's flesh - the earth was formed -and from his bones-the hills, the heaven from the skull-of that ice-cold giant--and from his blood the sea--of his hair trees and plants -and of his grows-formed Midgard for the sons of man--but of his brain- The heavy clouds are- all created (26). The great similarity between the Japanese and Nordic mythologies can be easily recognized. Nordic anthropomorphism, however, goes much farther than the Japanese. The Nordic gods are much more human than the Japanese Kamis and their half-gods (4). They appear with all possible human impairments. They are lame and one-eyed; they eat and drink and make love; they have "mortal" emotions and passions. They live like humans; they weave and plow; they fight amongst themselves; and they finally die. And in the Goetterdaemme- rung, the entire Germanic Pantheon goes down to destruction. This is indeed the most anthropomorphic mythology to which one can point (73). Standing somewhere between Japanese and Nordic anthropomor- phism are the creation myths of the Mixtec Indians of Middle America 214</page><page sequence="11">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 215 and the American Eskimos. From a Mixtec Indian myth we quote the following: In the year and in the day of obscurity and darkness, when there were as yet no year and no day, the world was chaos sunk in darkness. The whole earth was covered with water. Green slime floated on the surface of the water and the scum moved gently in the dark. One day came the god in human form and his beautiful goddess. This heavenly pair, out of their vast, unfathomed knowledge, raised a steep cliff over the abyss of water and on top of it they built a fine dwelling for them- selves. On the topmost point of the smooth cliff they laid a copper ax, edge up, and on his sharp edge rested the sky. For hundreds of years the gods lived in happiness. Two little sons were born to them, the ancient Mixtec Calendar shows the days of their birth. Wind g Snake was the day of the first born; Wind 9 Case was the birthday of the other (I). The following is from an American Eskimo myth: The Sun and the Moon were sister and brother -mortal once. In a house where there was no light they lay together and when the sister discovered who had been her companion, in her shame, she tore off her breasts and threw them at her brother, saying, "Since my body pleaseth thee, taste these two." Then she fled away, her brother pursuing, and each bearing the torches by means of which they had discovered one another. As they ran they rose up into the heavens; the sister's torch burned strong and bright, and she became the sun; the brother's torch died to a mere ember, and he became the moon (I). As to the actual functioning of the anthropomorphic religions, there is no difficulty in detecting this in the Nordic mythology; it is evident everywhere. It is not so easy to see the anthropomorphic functioning in monotheistic Islamism. Islam's Allah is an inexpressive god, and from the Koran we learn hardly anything about his conduct. But as to the cultic rule of Allah, Islamic doctrine evidences itself as an idealized human setting that is nothing else than an anthropomorphic action scheme. It is necessary to point out that Islamism, like Shin- toism, is a religion of command. Although the anthropomorphism of Nordic mythology resided in heaven in considerable ease, it encom- passed also, in the form of command, a strict ethical pattern of trust, confidence, and comradeship which is a basic functional pattern also in other anthropomorphic mythologies. It would appear that such a pattern of command goes with anthropomorphic religions, as animism goes with terrestrial religions.</page><page sequence="12">Ernest Harms The Psychological Type Most attempts to characterize Greek mythology in a typological way have labeled it an anthropomorphic religion (46). In the framework of the concept applied here this label would not quite fit the world of the Greek gods. To adjust the former concept to correspond with ours we must narrow the anthropomorphic aspect to a more intimate inner aspect - the psychological one. Nevertheless, we do not wish to join the ranks of the most radical psychological interpreters among classi- cal scholars such as Erwin Rhode (80). The writer also knows that his point of view will not find acceptance from such meritorious grecophiles as Jane E. Harrison (44), who sought to tie Greek mytho- logy to the Germanic north. It is unfortunate that Dr. Harrison shows a fear of mysticism, in which the real psychology of Greek theism is to be found. The same position was taken by Gilbert Murray (72), who seemed to have a religious fear of touching the psychological sphere of experience which makes the "temple atmosphere" a realistic approach to the Greek Olympus. Psychological theism implies a recognition of the gods as representing the psychological experience of the human internal world, the gods becoming the symbols of a personalized practical psychological ex- perience (80). What we today put in the form of abstract psychological laws and present in a verbal, descriptive way becomes personalized in active, alive figures. Although the writer is critical of some of Sigmund Freud's (33) famous theories and his application of mythological con- cepts to explain his theories, the Oedipus legend, in the manner that psychoanalysis has made it familiar, is a valuable approach to an under- standing of what we mean by psychological theism. Although the over- use of the Oedipus concept makes this writer often doubt its validity, there is still another element of limitation in the earlier interpretation of Greek mythology that must be noted: the difficulty of bridging the stream of history from Ioo B.C. to our own time. It was Friedrich Nietzsche (73) who pointed out so impressively that we are not able to re-experience completely how an individual of the Greek classical age "felt" or even "thought." What some have called sentimentality, super-estheticism, and sensitiveness must be understood simply as a different way of experiencing, which we today designate a psycholog- ical approach. Nonetheless, for the Greeks this was the psychological 216</page><page sequence="13">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 217 approach. Gilbert Murray (72), in speculating about this problem, says: "The psychic way is to regard the activities of the soul itself. The soul acts as if thoughts, though they pass on to other objects, nevertheless remain inside their begetters." Greek mythology cannot be entirely understood and explained by means of such a modern rational approach, although we might well apply it to other types of religious experience. In regard to Greek psychological mythology we need a somewhat different approach, one that the writer calls "historical empathy." Because of these special circumstances and the great impact of Greek culture on the humanistic branch of our civilization, it would be dif- ficult to approach Greek mythology by way of some general theoretical theistic aspect, or in the manner of our previous presentations. A more demonstrative approach is needed, one that the writer hopes will make possible a clearer understanding of the psychological personalization of Greek mythology. Let us take first the example of the goddess representing memory (8I). In Nordic mythology memory is represented by a crow sitting on Wotan's shoulder. This may be considered animal totemism. In Greek mythology the memory goddess, Mnemosyne, is significantly designated as the mother of the Muses, who are the goddesses of human creative abilities, science, the fine arts, and poetry. One must acknowledge this to be a most sensitive presentation of mental creativity, memory, and imagination. A step away on Olympus we meet the erotic grace of the goddess Aphrodite, who personalizes all that love can mean, in the wider, Greek sense. Two children are attributed to Aphrodite in this psychological mythology: Eros (desire) and Paitho (persuasion). Here again, in this psychological symbolism, is evidence of remarkable insight. One of the oldest of Greek myths is that of Prometheus and Epimetheus and Pandora (57). Prometheus was the wisest of the half-gods. Athena had taught him architecture, astronomy, mathematics, seafaring, medicine, chemistry, and many other arts and sciences which he passed on to mankind. But Zeus, angered by man's growing power and talents, de- cided to destroy the race, sparing them only on Prometheus's earnest pleas. One day, when Prometheus had played a joke on him, Zeus decided to punish the Titan by withholding fire from mankind. Prome- theus went to Athena to ask the favor of being allowed to descend</page><page sequence="14">Ernest Harms secretly to earth. He lighted a torch on the chariot of the sun, stole away undiscovered, and brought fire to mankind. Seeking revenge, Zeus ordered a clay woman to be made and had her adorned by the goddesses of Olympus. Thereafter, Pandora was the most beautiful of all women. Zeus sent her as a gift to Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus. Although warned by his brother not to accept gifts from Zeus, Epimetheus married Pandora, who, foolish, idle, and mischievous. could not resist opening a box in which Prometheus had imprisoned, with great effort, all the bad spirits that plagued mankind: aging, hard labor, sickness, mania, vice, and passion. All of these spirits were re- leased and attacked mankind. Only one was caught and kept in the box - hope. In Prometheus and Epimetheus we are presented with the two sides of intellectual expression, the one the creative and impulsive, the other the reflective. Translated into the terms of modern epistemology they are representative of the contradiction between deductive an inductive thinking. Poetic minds, however, have become fascinated by the original content of the Prometheus legend as contained in artistic presentations. J. W. von Goethe (39) and the Swiss poet Carl Splittler (84) have used the mythological brothers in poetic presentations of deep-seated traits of human character. The creative impulse producing thought and action, which is per- sonalized in Prometheus, leads mankind over the threshold from non- thinking existence to birth as human beings. According to this psycho- logical type of creativity legend, Prometheus makes man a self-thinking and self-acting, independent being, more or less separated from the gods. In the Greek version of the fall of man it is not Eve, with the apple and the snake, but Pandora, especially created by Zeus and his olympian helpers, who seduces the rebellious half-gods. The psycho- logical depth of this myth has been frequently discussed. No myth is as impressive, certainly not the terrestrial creation myth of Adam and Eve in the Old Testament. Another area of Greek mythological life is concerned with insti- tutional and ritual expression. There is nothing more characteristic of Greek religious life than what we know as the institution of the Mysterias (79). These were not only the center of Greek religious life, but the center of all social existence. Classical scholars have been puzzled by the Mysterias (73), and the battle still rages between those 218</page><page sequence="15">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 219 who would have them considered as "mere cultic plays with symbolism," and those who are convinced that they were psychological instruction and initiation rites of incomparable influence. This writer, of course, stands on the side of those who recognized in the Mysterias the rites of purification of the "soul" (79). Nietzsche (73), with good reason, designated the Greek national mentality as of a dramatic temperament, as expressed in Greek tragedy, which is supposedly aimed at producing a specific psychological cathartic impact on its audience - "to cause fear and trembling." The Mysterias had a similar aim, but on the highest religious cultic level. The French mythologist Eduard Schure (82), who attempted to reconstruct the Drama of Eleusis, has failed to link the cathartic experience with similar concepts of modern psychology, for example, those represented by C. G. Jung (54) (55). There can be no doubt that the religious festivals of Eleusis are akin to the modern confirma- tion rituals celebrated by many religions. In any case they are not mere "harvest rites," as Jane E. Harrison (46) would have us believe. As do modern confirmation rites, the Eleusis Mysterias aimed to reach adolescents. Their purpose was to instruct Greek youth intellectually and introspectively about their psychic personality and how to live safely with the problems of their inner nature. They seem to have been lesson-like instruction and sacred psychological preparation to make young persons ready for the inner experience. At the center of the initiation rite was attendance at such a dramatic performance. The most perceptive of all mythologists, Friedrich W. Creuzer (20), in his famous work, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Voelker, called the Mysterias the "drama of the fallen soul." Indeed, the entire exposition of the Mysterias points in the direction of such a psycho- logical symbolism. Although the gods involved appear in other con- nections in different characterizations and with much wider functions, in the psychological aspect they appear as persona dramaticae of the drama of the soul. Dionysus, who otherwise has been designated as a guide and adviser to man, appears in the Mysterias as a personification of the human ego forces in their controlling and directing functions. Persephone, usually appearing as the goddess of sensitivity, in the Mysterias becomes the personification of the general sense experience of man. Demeter, her mother, who is generally given the role of the All-Mother, in the Mysterias assumes the function of the motherly</page><page sequence="16">Ernest Harms background of the human soul. What, in this setting, is means by the "underworld" is not difficult to guess: it is everything that concerns the subconscious sphere and the lower forces connected with it in man's inner nature. Pluto is the "master" of the storms of emotion and affects. Now begins the drama of the danger that inner experience will be overcome by the lower forces in man's soul through the affects of the subconscious. This happened to Persephone, the representative of higher mental awareness. Only the powers of the ego, represented by Dionysus, can attempt to save her. Here we have the psychological aspect of Greek religiosity, the drama of ego-control, the birth of self- control and of living without danger of being subdued and carried down into the psychic underworld. This, for the Greek of that time, was the greatest of mythological experiences. It was Jane E. Harrison who brought to the attention of mytho- logists an impressive documentary object (45) which would otherwise probably have been overlooked and forgotten. The object is a cinerary urn found in a columbarium on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and now in the Museo delle Terma (45). Archeologists and classical philologists have argued about whether it represents a part of the small or large Eleusinian Mysterias or some more general initiation rite. For us, this argument is immaterial. What concerns us is that the urn gives proof of a psychological conception of Greek mythology. On one side of the urn a young man stands in front of an aged one. The young man's head is bent. On the floor is a pig. The old man pours water on the young man's head from a pitcher held in one hand, while in the other is a bowl containing what Dr. Harrison has identified as poppy seeds. The old man is doubtless a priest in the act of performing a purification rite. The pig is a much-used symbol of uncleanness and sex. In the Eleusinian cult neophytes performed symbolic actions to do away with their piggishness. The poppy seeds, a derivative of which has been used for thousands of years, would seem to symbolize a tranquilizing agent. The urn shows a second group. Here the young man sits with covered head in an attitude of devotional meditation. Beside him is a ritual figure of what would appear to be a priestess holding over his head what Dr. Harrison deciphers as a "liknon," a fruit basket. This group represents a second stage in a rmysterium process in which the 220</page><page sequence="17">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man young man to be initiated receives strengthening by spiritual fruit. On the other side of the urn another group shows the third major stage of the ritual. The young man is now prepared to face Demeter, the chief goddess of the Mysteriurn. Demeter thrusts toward the youth the symbol of temptation, the snake, which the youth, now immune, touches without being bitten. Behind Demeter stands Persephone, holding the torch of mental light. Having withstood the temptations of physical love, the youth is ready for "sacred marriage" and the "sacred birth of the higher self." His higher mental ego, or personality, his self- control, are born. What in psychological terms would today be called sublimation, transformation, integration, or individuation, and what religious cultism would call consecration, appears here in antique Greek form. Again, it was the insightful Jane E. Harrison who pointed to a passage from the Baccae of Euripides which describes in verbal form the essence of these psychological mysteria procedures. This writer has translated the pertinent lines in a form expressing its content in the aspect of our presentation here (45). Achelous' devoted daughter, Holy Dirce, You patient, help-willing, and pure soul, Taking on into yourself the child of the spirit This mysteria motherhood. Created out of the immortal spirit From which his Father God has taken him Through his own power and now prepare him For this second, the Ego's spiritual birth This mystery of unearthly creation. With this incomparably sensitive example we close our presentation of Greek psychological theism. 3) The Greeks were not the only ones to develop a psychological the- istic mythology. We have chosen as our first example from among the others the Finn-Urgic (47) as expressed in the Finnish national poem, the Kalevala. Study of the mythology of any of the Finn-Urgic 3) We have not given an example of a Greek creation myth for the reason that in the wealth of mythological documentation from ancient Greece there are a number of such myths in which are interwoven so much unabstractable detail that it is almost impossible to obtain the picture desired. We believe, however, that the material given is sufficient to demonstrate what we intended. 221</page><page sequence="18">Ernest Harms peoples, or of certain Eskimo groups living in the same region, re- veals a specific concept of the soul underlying all religious life. Souls are separate and in addition to the animistic spirits or forces of nature, and they play a primary role. They have a specific human-like character and are personally expreriencable. There is, first of all, the human soul itself, which leaves the body partially when man sleeps or dreams or becomes ill, but which remains with it after death until the earthly shell is completely decomposed (47). There are different, often controversial, opinions as to where, ac- cording to this mythology, the soul is located. Some say in the heart, others say in the liver, still others say in the blood. There are detailed stories of how the independent soul of the child joins its body in the womb of the mother before birth. There are shadow souls which follow man around during life like a bad conscience. Souls are everywhere. Things-food, a well, an axe-have souls. Animals, water, the mountains have souls. Food that has started to decompose has "lost" its "soul," as an axe when it gets dull. Shamans and other superior individuals who are born with special kinds of souls parallel the Greek mythological heroes. Among some ethnic groups certain animals are psychologically deified and acquire special souls, as, for example, the bear. The killing of such an animal involves not only his body but his special soul as well (47). There are special rituals for the magical dealings with such an animal-super-soul. During the winter, when he hibernates, the soul of the bear is exorcised. To pre- vent him from causing harm to man there are special rituals to be followed after the individual animal is killed which relate to the soul- group to which the animal belonged. The Kalevala (56), the finnish national epos, is a remarkable ex- ample of psychological theism. We do not know how far back in history to place the origin of this great poem, which was collected during the first half of the Igth century. Those who have studied it have emphasized as its specific character that it does not present primarily the actions and fate of its heroes, but rather their personality traits, emotions, and desires. In other words, the Kalevala is what the writer would term psycho-centered. The English translator J. M. Crawford (56), who was very much aware of this fact, formulated his impression thus: "There is a profound philosophical trait in the poem, indicative of the deep insight into the working of the human 222</page><page sequence="19">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man mind and into the forces of nature." There is a giving of souls to everything, what in German is called "All-Beseelung" and for which there is no adequate word in the English language. Here are two short excerpts from the Kalevala that express a kind of pan-psychism: Rise ye heroes of the broadsword Ye, the earth's eternal heroes From the deeps ye sickle-bearers From the brooks, ye crossbow-shooters Come thou forest, with thine archers Come, ye thickets with your armies Mountain spirits, with your powers Come fell Hisi with thy horrors Water-mother with thy dangers. The Creator speaks the words that follow: Evil only comes from evil, This is the expectoration Of fell Suoyatar, its mother: Therefore would the thing be evil, Should I breathe a soul within it, Should I give it sense of vision. (56) The fifth rune (chapter) of the Kalevala contains a short description of a creation myth which is not typologically easy to classify. Accord- ing to this myth, it was Ilmatar, daughter of the air (some mytho- logies identify the soul with air), who created the world. It is signi- ficant that there is not only a description of facts, but a description of psychic conditions of the creatress, her feelings and emotional reac- tions. It is related that she is "tired from emptiness," that she is "tortured by loneliness" and a longing for creative life, and that she is "consumed by a sharp joy." All that occurs is, so to speak, viewed psychologically. From other parts of the world we would cite the religion of the American Indian, which contains one of the richest of mythologies and from which examples of all five of our basic types could be ex- tracted. Psychological mythology has been especially richly developed among the Indians of the North American Northwest, the Haidas and their neighbor tribes (32) (83). There is a clear separation in their mythology between ghosts, spirits, and souls, with the emphasis on souls. The Haida have three words for "soul," of which two apply to incarnated souls and one to disembodied souls. There is a wide variety of myths concerned with psychic life after death and reincar- 223</page><page sequence="20">Ernest Harms nation. There is a "Land of the Soul" to which the impaired go; the wicked are reborn as animals. A number of Haidaic myths bear a striking similarity to Greek myths. Franz Boas (12), the anthropolo- gist, has pointed to one that is almost identical with the Orpheus and Eurydice myth. The most radical pan-psychistic mythologies are found among the aboriginal tribes of Africa (89) and New Zealand (23). The Ekoi tribe of Nigeria (85) believe that everything comes from the soul and returns to the soul. In one version of this myth man has one soul, but in other versions he has several. There is a soul for the bush and a soul for every animal. Each man's soul is partly an animal soul with which man has a totem connection. When man dies he goes with his soul underground to the earth goddess. He returns only on rare occasions (Io). Different authors have different views of this strangely pan-psychistic tribe, the differences probably arising out of reports from individuals who had different conceptions. The pan-psychism of the Maori, a New Zealand tribe, came very early to the attention of mythologists because of the plasticity of its mythology. A. E. Crawley sums up some of the Maori concepts: Their word ata, "reflected light," was sometimes used of the soul, but wairua was the common term, signifying a shadowy form... The soul of food was absorbed by the gods in sacrifice. When the fairies accepted a present of jewels, they took only the "soul" or "similitude" of the orna- ments... A maori warrior would gouge out and swallow the eyes of a chief whom he had slain in battle, hoping thus to appropriate his atua, which we are told resided in his eyes. Seed-taros were placed in the hands of the corpse... In order to catch the soul of a distinguished man, it was enticed by a bit of his body or a piece of his clothes. When a chief was killed in battle he was cooked and eaten. It was believed that his soul entered the stones of the oven in which he was cooked and that retained it so long as they retained any heat. (I9) The following is a translation by the writer of a transcript by Adolf Bastian of a verbal report by a Maori chieftain of a creation myth of impressive psychological character: When there was neither being nor non-being, when there was only not- yet-being, in the timeless circle of the swinging mother-nights, a something, a foreboding tied to a longing started to undulate. It touched the dream- state of a half-awake being, causing convulsive sensations in a kind of thinking of a hunger for spiritual experience, directed by the desire for the beaming aura of beauty pressuring for shaping. By seizure "full-bliss" the creation of the breath of life occurs within the spacelessness for the creation of the world. (9) 224</page><page sequence="21">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man Another type among the many psychological creation myths of the Maori has been reported by John White: IO is really the god. He made the heaven and the earth. IO was the sign of good and evil. The involuntary twitching of any part of the human body was recognized as IO. If a company of travelers by land or sea were detained by rain or wind, and a twitching in the middle of the arm or leg were felt by the chief, or priest, or another person of note, such was an omen of evil to the company. Whosoever was the subject of IO, he always communicated the matter to his companions, some of whom immediately took the most extreme measures to prevent being surprised by an enemy, while others consulted as to its interpretation... If the IO were under either ear it was an omen of death. If it were on the lower lip or chin, it was an omen of food for that person. (9I) The following lines from a Maori mourning rite express in an exceptional way the emotional, psychological impact of the rite on the people: Her praise is ever heard This praise of kindness I am shorn of all And live in silence Friendless and alone I would, could I, But haste me Far up to the heavens Oh, that wanderers from above Would come That I might weep In the house of Him, the god of Blood-red crime Grief to grief now Gathers all my woe And floods my heart with weeping Yet I dread agony And withdraw me At fear of e'en. Flows with blood The tide of keen regret And severed once, Forever severed All our love. (7) 225 NUMEN XIII, 3 I5</page><page sequence="22">Ernest Harms The specific functional pattern that all these psychological mytho- logies appear to have in common is the desire to express theistic ex- perience in great polyphony. The psychological experience seems to create an increasing desire to develop and to relate in minute detail to the responding area in the theistic sphere. In all of the Near Eastern and European world no people has produced as large a number of theistic myths as have the Greeks. It seems to the writer significant, however, that other groups of the psychological theistic type have pro- duced a similar wealth of mythological or folkloristic output. Besides possessing the largest folk-epos of modern times, the Finnish peoples have produced a folklore comprising over 50 volumes of the Acta Fenica. The American Indian tribes of the Northwest and the Maoris have also surpassed other groups of their kind in mythological out- put (63). The Spiritual Type What we shall now present as the spiritual type of theistic concept has frequently been characterized by others as a psychological type of religion. It is true that the spiritual type is based mainly on inner experience, but this experience is quite different from what is under- stood by the West as psychological, which aims to provide insight into innate capacities based on the inner security organ that we call the ego, or the self. The object of psychological insight is security in our experience of the world in which we live, and self-control over the workings of our inner nature. The Indian (36) world does not know of and does not want such a psychology. It has a relationship with what it considers real by an experience of it which Glasenapp (35) has called "magical identification." What we are presented with in Indian religion is not something "real" in the Western sense. It is a "religion," a unification with what Eastern religion from the be- ginning until today has called the "spiritual." The Nestor of Indian research, H. Oldenberg, has described this approach in a clear and concise manner: All existence appears animated with spirits, whose confused masses crowd upon each other, buzzing, flocking, swarming along with the phantom souls of the dead, and act, each according to its nature, in every occurrence. If a human being fall ill, it is a spirit that has taken possession of him and imposes upon him his ills. The patient is cured by enticing the spirit from him with magic. A spirit dwells in the flying arrow. He who shoots off an 226</page><page sequence="23">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 227 arrow performs a bit of magic which puts this spirit into action. The spirits have sometimes human, sometimes animal form. Neither form is nobler or lower than the other, for as yet no distinction between the human and bestial nature has been made. (75) Everything that characterizes the thousands of years of Indian cul- tural history and the variety of its forms of religious expression centers around this basic concept (36). There are positive and negative, mono- theistic and polytheistic, pessimistic and hedonistic concepts, all based on this spiritual background. Basic to all Indian religion and phylo- sophy of the spiritual type is the emphasis on solving the conflicts in human existence and living in proper relationship with the underlying spirits (5I). This may be simply a life adjustment, or a complete ascetic extinction of earthly existence, as found in radical Jainism It is always "the way" that forms the center of the religious activity. This is so whether one views Indian religiosity under the Nirvana or the Maya aspect (27). In exemplification of the above we offer one of the early Indian creation myths from the tenth book of the Rig Veda. Then there was neither being nor non-being: There was no air, no firmament beyond it. Was there a stirring? Where? Beneath what cover? Was there a great abyss of unplumbed water? There was no death nor anything immortal; Nor any sign dividing day from night. That One Thing in the stillness, breathed quiescent, No second thing existed whatsoever. Darkness was hidden in a deeper darkness; This All was as a sea without dimensions; The void still held unformed what was potential, Until the power of Warmth produced the sole One. Then, in that One, Desire stirred into being, Desire that was the earliest seed of Spirit. (The sages probing in their hearts with wisdom Discovered being's kinship in non-being. Stretching their line across the void, they pondered; Was aught above it, or was aught below it?) Bestowers of the seed were there; and powers; Free energy below, above, swift action.</page><page sequence="24">Ernest Harms Who truly knows, and who can here declare it? When It was born, and how this world was fashioned? The gods came later than the earth's creation: Who knows then out of what the world has issued? Whether he made the world or did not make it, He knows whence this creation came, he only Who in the highest heaven guards and watches; He knows indeed, but then, perhaps, he knows not. (7I) Here we have a monotheism beginning with The One, designated as the spirit, as the earliest principle. Out of The One emanated the "gruesome" desire of man's existence as the "earliest seed." The earth came first, and "the gods came later than the earth's creation." Note the difference in the sequence of the creative process as between this spiritual theism and the types of theism we have presented up to now: first the spirit, The One; then the seed that creates man; then the earth; and finally, the gods. We should note especially the last four lines of this creation myth, which represent the ultimate in spiritual pessimism. Our tragically realistic human expression of consciousness must sink into non-existence, into Nirvana. There is not even trust in the beginning, because he cannot see and he does not want to see an end. In the Upanishads, the Indian mythological documents of highest accreditation, one reads, in the second Khanda of the Keha: If a man knows this here, that is the true end of life; if he does not know this here, then there is a great destruction (new births). The wise who have thought on all things and recognized the Self in them, become immortal, when they have departed from this world. (70) (27) Even wisdom and knowledge, according to this spiritual doctrine, can have but one purpose, namely, spiritual rebirth. To find the way to Nirvana (40) is the aim of Indian spiritualism. Spiritual theism, however, does not exist only at these heights of East-Indian religiosity. It is seen also in American Indian folklorism. Here is a spiritualistic creation myth from the Apache tribe of the Jicarillas: In the beginning there was nothing at all but darkness, water and cyclones. There was no earth, no people, no animals, no fish in the water. Only the spirits were there, the great spirits and powers who existed before time began. 228</page><page sequence="25">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man They made the earth first, and then the sky. But that did not seem to be enough. Creator was the chief of them all. He was the first to make an animal. He knew how to do it. So he made an animal out of clay. He put four legs on it, and then he made a tail. "Walk on the four feet," he said. The animal walked. "That's pretty good," the Creator said. "You are all right. Now run along." (76) While naive in the extreme, the myth is of the same basic pattern as the Rig Veda. There are a number of spiritual mythologies among the aboriginal groups of Africa, Oceania, and North America. The specific characte- ristic that unites them is a lack of realism, or what might be called a logic of reality, a lack of mythological meaningfulness found in most other types of religion. The Cosmic Type Cosmogenic theistic concepts are those in which the center is mainly or entirely in the sphere of astrology as understood by ancient or primitive peoples. The overwhelming power of the sun has placed this cosmic phenomenon in the center of the religious systems of many peoples. One thinks first of Egypt, the cultic life of which centered almost entirely around the sun. Here are the opening lines of the famous sun prayer of Ikn-aton: Thy dawning is beautiful in the horizon of the sky, 0 living Aton, Beginning of Life, When thoug risest in the eastern horizon Thou fillest every land with thy beauty, Thy rays, they encompass the lands, even all that though hast made. Thoug art Re, and thou carriest them all away captive; Thou bindest them by thy love. (48) There have come to us the texts of a number of creation myths which vary in all respects except that Ra, or Re, the sungod, is the original creator, the center of the whole theistic concept. The following lines are from the so-called Alexander II Papyrus: The Master of Everything said after his forming I am he who was formed as Khepri. When I had formed them only the forms were formed, All the forms were formed after my forming. Numerous are the forms from that which proceeded from my mouth. 229</page><page sequence="26">Ernest Harms The heaven had not been formed. The earth had not been formed. The ground had not been created - the reptiles in that place. I raised myself among them in the abyss out of inertness. (58) Here is another creation myth from the so-called Turin Papyrus: Chapter of the divine God who arose by himself Who made the heaven, the earth, the air of life and the fire, The Gods of men, the wild animals and the flocks The reptiles, the birds and the fish, The king of men and of Gods together. (68) The entire genealogy of the Egyptian theistic world consists of a sun god (who appears under the names Atun, Re, or Ra) and children of the sun god. There are, firstly, Shu and Tefenet and Qeb and Nut. The children of Qeb are Osiris and Isis, and the children of Nut are Seth and Nephthys. They comprise the major part of the Egyptian Olympus, which in its entirety is cosmological. The same is true of early Persian Zoroastrian theism. The Zoro- astrian creation myth begins as follows: As the first step in the cosmogenic process - it was said - Ahura Mazda produced Vohu Maanah (the Good Mind), whereupon Angra Mainyu im- mediately created Aka Manah (the Evil, Mind); and in like manner when Ahura Mazda formed the other Amesha Spentas, his adversary shaped their counterparts. After all this was completed, the creation of the world took place in due order - sky, water, earth, plants, animals and mankind. In shapening the sky and the heavenly bodies Ahura Mazda produced first the celestial sphere and the constellations, especially the zodiacal signs. The stars are a warlike army destined or battle against the evil spirits. There are 6,480,000 small stars and the many which are at unnumbered places were assigned in the four quarters of the sky. (48) One of the most impressive of the Near Eastern creation myths is the Babylonian. The following is a loose translation by the writer from a German version: And Marduck established the position of all the major gods. He arranged in the heaven the zodiac in its right place. He established the course of the year by equal partition, Dividing it into twelve months, In quarterly groups, according to the position of the stars. After this he counted the days of the year And balanced it with the division of the months. 230</page><page sequence="27">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man Then he established the position of Jupiter So that he had the right place among the other stars, So that none was disturbed in its course. The Marduck decided the position of Bel and Ea. He opened gates on both ends of the heaven And anchored them solidly on the left as well as on the right. Upon this he measured the horizon according to the height of her belly. He gave the moon and his diety his light and put him to take care of the night. He made him so the governor of the night would help measure the length of the day. This is what he told the moon: Monthly without fail you must go through the cycle of your disc's appear- ance; At the start of the month you are the crescent new moon Which you shall be for six days. At the seventh day you shall become half-moon And at the fifteenth day you shall be full moon, round like the sun. And then by direction of the god's great council The division of heaven and earth was established. Marduck arranged the bright day for the benefit of mankind. He placed the sun in the sky, starting her course Beginning on the horizon And moving through the midst of the heaven Shining faithfully upon the earth. After the heaven was created, The heaven created the earth, The earth created the rivers, The rivers created the canals, The canals created the morass, The morass created the worm... (14) This elaborate cosmology seems to be the high point of the cos- mologies of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern world. We have quoted here only a few of the more significant of these. Others might be enumerated, such as, for example, the Armenian, which has a most elaborate moon and star cult but of which no satisfactory documentation is available. Cosmological theism, however, is not limited to the high culture areas of the world. It is to be found in practically every part of the world, and especially among the ancient nations of the American con- tinent. The amazing cosmologies developed by the Aztecs and the Mayas (4I) are still a source of astonishment. These peoples had an amazingly correct calendar and unique cosmological systems embracing 231</page><page sequence="28">Ernest Harms numbers of suns, with definite mythological functions attributed to moon and stars. Brief documentation exists concerning the cosmologies of the Incas, who had a sun-father who created the world and the heavenly bodies and formed man from clay. Remains show that most Incan cults were primarily sun cults. A characteristic Mayan creation myth of the cosmological type is the following: Long ago people did not live upon the earth where we now live. They lived in a world far below us. They had no sun or moon or stars. It was very dark and wet. The gods were not pleased with this world or the beings which they had created, so they said, "We will destroy this world and all the people and make a new world." And so they did. The new world was above the first one. But it was still very wet end very dark and the people were not happy. The gods destroyed this world en tried a third time, but the third world was still very bad. The gods looked at the unhappy people living in darkness and mud. They had webbed hands and feet and long tails. Their homes were not real homes at all but pits dug in the mud. The Sun Father said, "We must make a fourth world. We will make it dry and give the people light.a' So the fourth world was made above the one where the people were living. The Sun Father sent the lightning to make an opening between the two worlds. The earth shook and trembled. At last when all was still again the Morning Star and his twin brother, the Evening Star, went into the under- world to find a way to bring the people out. They found some people paddling about in the mud near the opening. The Stars shone so brightly that the mud people could not look at them. The Morning Star said, "Where is your chief? We want to see him." The people said, "He lives over there," and pointed to a place a little farther on. The brothers looked about but they could see no house. The people led them to a muddy pit where the chief lived. Morning Star shook his head sadly. He said, "The Sun Father has sent us to tell you to come to the new world that he has made for you. There it is light and warm." (2) Frazer has reported this cosmogenic myth from the Blackfoot Indians: They have a divine creator who is in some manner identified with the sun. The earth itself is believed to be a divinity of some kind, for in their invocation if they call the sun "our father," they call the earth, "our mother." It seems also that the moon is considered to be one and the same divinity as the sun. (32) There can be little doubt as to the cosmological character of myths in which the sun, the moon, and the stars function in a personalized way. We quote below a prayer of the American Pawnee Indians, of whom Burr Alexander reports that they had a sun cult similar to 232</page><page sequence="29">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man that of the Egyptians at Heliopolis, and which suggests the sun cult that some have attempted to construct from the ruins of Stonehenge. Great Sun Power! I am praying for my people that they may be happy in the summer and that they may live through the cold of winter. Many are sick and in want. Pity them and let them survive. Grant that they may live long and have abundance. May we go through these ceremonies correctly, as you taught our forefathers to do in the days that are past. If we make mistakes pity us. Help us, Mother Earth! for we depend upon your good- ness. Let there be rain to water the prairies, that the grass may grow long and the berries be abundant. O Morning Star! when you look down upon us, give us peace and refreshing sleep. Great Spirit! bless our children, friends, and visitors through a happy life. May our trails lie straight and level before us. Let us live to be old. We are all your children and ask these things with good hearts. (I) Another important example of cosmogenic mythology remains to be mentioned. We present it, if not with reluctance, at least with cau- tion, since there will no doubt be intensive opposition from those who are deeply involved with this mythological concept, and even more, by those who consider themselves the only rightful representatives of it. We refer to the Christian mythology. We immediately add that we do not mean Christianity in its present dogmatized forms, but the earliest Christian mythology. Our contention is not based solely on reports of the birth in Nazareth attended by the shepherds and the three kings who were guided by a star, as related in the New Testament. We also do not wish to be considered an adherent of con- cepts such as those put forward by Arthur Drewes (24), who has tried to prove that there was no human individual Jesus and that Christian concept was based on an Oriental astrological construction. We base our assertion on what is called the "esoteric" tradition of Christianity as contained in the teachings of the Order of the Templars and other similar groups up to the I5th century, which had a definite tradition of Christian cosmology. Since documentation of this has never appeared in verbal form, the details must be pieced together from symbolic and pictorial representations. Many details of this cosmo- logy are in fact common knowledge, but they have never been recog- nized as cosmogenic by the millions who live with them, religiously and cultically, day in and day out. Take, for example, the most com- mon Roman Catholic prayer, the Ave Maria, which in its original Latin form is as follows: 233</page><page sequence="30">Ernest Harms Ave maria stella Dei mater alma Atqua semper virigo Felix coeli porta Summus illus Ave Gabriel ore Funda nos in pace Mutans nome Eva. According to the "official" translation of I849 in the Lyra Catho- lica, the Ave Maria reads as follows: Gentle Star of Ocean Portal of the Sky Ever Virgin Mother Of the Lord Most High. Oh, by Gabriel's Ave Utter'd long ago Eva's name reversing Stablish peace below. (64) We have here, beyond any doubt, the naive formulation of a cos- mological concept in astrological terms that are the background of all such expressions. The Virgin Mary as the "Star of Ocean," the wordplay on the name Eva (Ave), the relating of the mother of Christ to the "Mother of Man," who caused man's fall into earthly sin, point to a cosmological meaning. According to these primeval concepts, Jesus of Nazareth was incarnated as a spirit of the sun to counter the further petrification of the earth and to turn its fate back to the center of the solar system and the higher spheres of the cosmos. Up to the 15th century portions of this cosmological concept were still fairly comon, as evidenced by expressions of it in art. Albrecht Duerer, for example, in his paintings repeatedly shows the Maria stepping on the moon. Maria was thus overcoming the forces of the moon in petrification of the earth. Once aware of these cosmological features of Christian mythology one will find expressions of it everywhere, especially in early art. A study, for example, of early mosaics, such as those of the Basillicas of Ravenna, Italy, will provide further in- sight. To give more details would require a lengthy presentation not possible within the confines of this treatise. To sum up, cosmological concepts have almost always the tendency 234</page><page sequence="31">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man toward an extension of power, whether of a king, as in Egypt, or of an organization such as the Roman Church, which wants to over- power the world. This treatise has attempted to open a new road to the study of reli- gion by applying an organizing concept derived from the wide con- ceptional point of view. The German language has provided the most appropriate word to describe this concept-"Weltanschauung," a word difficult to translate, but conveying the idea of a total conception of man's outer world experience. The effort has been undertaken in the hope of finding a basic aspect for a science of religion that would bring order to and lead to a classification of the multiplicity of reli- gions and religions phenomena and perhaps provide an answer to the why of this multiplicity. Attempts with the same aim in view have of course been made from different approaches. Some have sought to find specific temporal and cultural differences or peculiarities. Classi- fication from the point of view of the structural composition of differ- ent religions may be possible. The writer, in his introduction, has mem- tioned as an illustration the study o the role of the priesthood in various religions as one way of establishing such differentiation and classifi- cation. Study of specific cult patterns might also be enlightening. Having presented our concept of the creation myth as a basis for classification we are now better equiped than we were in our intro- duction for a discussion of the reasons for and the value of the typo- logical procedure we have presented. We are aware that metaphysicians and theologians will energetically oppose our basis of classification because it applies, to the evaluation and classification of theistic worlds, aspects taken from the world of human concepts. To this we reply that even if it is assumed that God or the gods created man and his world, the creation was accomplished in a way that it could be understood by whatever powers of perception this or that human group had or has, and would satisfy the religious needs of that group. In other words, religions are made to accommo- date and to be understood by man. They contain whatever man needs to satisfy his religious needs and to permit him to make adjustments to his inner and outer world. Therefore, a religion expresses what a specific group needs to experience or exercise as its religion. The par- ticular needs of a particular human group shape the totality and the details of its religion. Religions viewed as study materials must be seen 235</page><page sequence="32">Ernest Harms as the experiences of specific groups which paint the image of their religion. We are, so to say, dealing with the images of gods and reli- gions as human beings have viewed and created them. We therefore feel that we are justified in stating, as we did in our introduction, that religions are created by man. Man's ultimate range of experience extends from his introspective psychological perception, via his total perception of the outer world, to the world created by his theistic imagination. An effort to determine the reason for the multiplicity of religions that we have here tried, in a first attempt, to classify must arrive at the answer that the reason for the variety of religions is the variety of man, whether the distinction be racial, national, geographical, or cultural, or whether historically or conceptionally determined. Whether one views things in a materialistic, ideological, biological, or psychological way is determined by the kind of mind one has, in other words, one's disposition. The famous saying of the German philosopher Fichte that one's philosophy depends on what kind of man one is, may be applied to the world of religion, so that we may say that the kind of religion a group has depends on the kind of human beings that comprise the group. Turning to the problem of classification, the writer must say that the selection of the five types he has presented is the result of a quarter of a century's occupation with comparative studies of religion. The selection, of course, has been influenced by the opinions of other leading scholars whom he has quoted throughout this treatise, such as Alex- ander (I), Bastian (7), Murray (72), Harrisson (45), Oldenberg (75), and others who have characterized the various religions they described in terms that have been made use of here, and we must emphasize that the five types we have designated will be found, individually, in the works of these scholars. There are, of course, to be found other designations which may appear to lend themselves to the establishment of other types. We have found none, however, that appear to us to have sufficient substantialization to justify its designation as a general type. In our introduction we discussed the major criterion in the selection of types of religion - centeredness. We feel that nothing need be added to that concept. There would appear to be greater justification for discussing some secondary aspects. There are certain mythologies in which the centeredness and the specific characteristic are so strongly 236</page><page sequence="33">Five basic types of theistic worlds in the religions of man 237 and definitely expressed that there can be no doubt as to our desig- ation. In the case of the Japanese (3), Nordic (78), Indian (27) (36), and Egyptian (29) mythologies cited above this seems to be the case. There are others in which the picture is not quite so clear and in connection with which one faces difficulties in establishing a final designation. There are mythologies that have such a richness of ex- pression that it is not easy to pinpoint the decisive and constant cha- racteristic. The Finnish (56) and Maori (23) mythologies are of this kind. For students of Greek culture it will not be necessary to explain why we have given so much space to the discussion of the typological problem in Greek mythology. Nevertheless, we should like to explain that the variety of opinion as to the character of Greek mythology and the possibility of showing in detail the various aspects of our typo- logical concept justified this lengthy presentation. It was the purpose of this paper to present the concept of applying typology to the classification of mythologies and religions and to propose five basic mythological types. Much detail would have to be presented to make of our typological attempt a rounded-out science of religion. We have already said that several types of mythologies can be observed in the history of some of the major religions, and the answer to the why of this is only one of many. We have not here gone into the question of when a certain type appears in the develop- ment of a major religion, or of whether the type itself seems to have undergone certain changes. It is, for example, to be observed that a one-sided development of one type may cause a reaction similar to what may be observed in the political field in human society. A rever- sal may take place, or a foreign religion may find a foothold. Finally, religions, like all factors of human science, are subject to a coming- into-being, that is to say, being-born. They develop and mature, go through an aging process, and become extinct. Discussion of these problems is left to a future presentation. REFERENCES i. Alexander, Hartley Burr.
