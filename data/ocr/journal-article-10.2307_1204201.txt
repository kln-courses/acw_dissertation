<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCHOLEM, GERSHOM. On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in Kabbalah. New York: Schocken Books, 1991. 328 pp. $30.00 (cloth). This volume contains six essays, originally published in book form as Von der Mys- tischen Gestalt der Gottheit (Zurich, 1962) and in Hebrew translation by Joseph Ben- Shlomo, Elements of the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (Jerusalem, 1976), written by the eminent scholar of Jewish mysticism Gershom Scholem. The essays included in this volume, together with five other studies published in the book, Zur Kabbalah und ihrer Symbolik (Ziirich, 1960), translated into English by Ralph Manheim, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York, 1965), and included in the aforemen- tioned Hebrew translation of Ben-Shlomo, constitute Scholem's lectures deliv- ered before the Eranos Society's annual meeting in Ascona, Switzerland, between 1950 and 1961. Most of these essays were first published as articles in the Eranos- Jahrbuch (Zurich, 1934-). These studies without question represent Scholem the historian of religion at his best. The presentation of this material to a wider audience comprising phe- nomenologists, psychologists, and historians of religion freed Scholem of the usual concern of tracing historical, philological, and textual connections. Here Scholem is interested in the world of ideas, what one may call the philosophical underpinnings of the mystical and mythical structures that informed the imagina- tion of Jewish mystics through the ages: traditions concerning the attribution of anthropomorphic shape to the deity; the dualism of good and evil in kabbalistic literature; the motif of the axis mundi, the righteous pillar of the world, in Jewish mysticism; the feminine element of divinity in Jewish religion, especially as it 655</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion evolves in theosophic kabbalah; the motif of transmigration of souls; and the con- cept of the astral body as intermediary between the physical body and soul. To be sure, Scholem's rich presentation of these basic themes in the literature of Jewish mysticism builds on his previous historical and philological work, but in the con- text of these lectures (and the written essays based thereon), he was concerned with making this material relevant to the nonspecialist as well as making the spe- cialist realize the spiritual depth of the Jewish mystical traditions. The essays in this volume attest to Scholem's profound grasp of phenomeno- logical issues in the history of Jewish mysticism in particular and the history of religions in general. Indeed, it may be said that his selection of topics reflects both his intimate knowledge of the Jewish sources as well as his reading of more general sources in phenomenology and the history of mysticism in other reli- gions, including Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, and Sufisim, to name but a few examples. Time and again the reader confronts the wide range of Scho- lem's intellectual grasp and his insatiable appetite for ideas. The broader issues inform Scholem's careful textual analyses of the Jewish mystical texts. Although Scholem is clearly interested in deep structures of religious thought (frequently embracing the domain of myth), he does not lose sight of historical context. In- deed, Scholem's phenomenological approach is well rooted in an historical sensi- bility, for, as Joseph Dan notes in the preface to this volume, Scholem was not interested in delineating "unchanging, ahistorical archetypes" but rather in dis- cussing the "dialectics of a dynamic historical development" (pp. 6-7). Yet, one must be careful of turning Scholem into a naive, empiricistic historian who fails to recognize continuities through change and the enduring power of certain foundational mythic ideas in religious consciousness. On the contrary, it is most evident from these essays, as well as from other work of Scholem, that he did accept the notion of structures of religion that must be sought in the textual remains of any community. Scholem's attitude toward mysticism as articulated in the first chapter of Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1954) is instructive: "There is no mysticism as such, there is only the mysticism of a particular reli- gious system, Christian, Islamic, Jewish mysticism and so on. That there remains a common characteristic it would be absurd to deny, and it is this element which is brought out in the comparative analysis of particular mystical experiences" (p. 6). What Scholem rejects, therefore, is the positing of an "abstract mystical reli- gion," not the possibility of common structures manifesting themselves in differ- ent religions. On the contrary, with respect to particular motifs, it is clear that Scholem maintained that different religions influenced one another in an histori- cal way or reflected basic issues that are essential to religious discourse (see, e.g., pp. 15-16, 56-59). He would have opposed the notion of an abstract timeless archetype but certainly not the presence of archetypal structures in lived religious cultures (the study on the Shekhinah, the feminine element of God, in Jewish sources is an exemplary illustration of this; see pp. 140-96). To take but one example from the many that could have been chosen from this collection of es- says, Scholem suggests that the kabbalistic treatment of the astral body, especially as it appears in zoharic literature, represents a synthesis of older Hermetic, Neo- platonic, and Zoroastrian ideas that may have been channeled to the Spanish kabbalists through Ashekenazi sources (cf. pp. 260-61), on the one hand, and Islamic sources (cf. pp. 262, 316, n. 32), on the other. This particular case illus- trates a larger methodological point: Scholem did not simply posit novel change without appreciating the fact that a tradition is often much older than its present historical manifestation. Scholem's orientation is dialectical in the true sense of 656</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the term (understood in its Hegelian valence). That is, he treats his subject mat- ters in both a diachronic and a synchronic manner. New developments emerge out of older sources that may be transmitted either orally or in written form; this point is basic to Scholem's reconstruction of the so-called origins of kabbalah in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The role of history in Scholem's phenomenology is a very subtle one. While he does not ignore historical context and the need to recognize change or innova- tion, he also consistently acknowledges the continuity of traditions, often over a long period of time (see, e.g., pp. 98-100). I would suggest that Scholem's orien- tation, as represented especially in On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead, is a kind of contextual archetypalism (a term that applies as well to Henry Corbin, another member of the Eranos Society in Scholem's time). That is, the archetypal struc- tures are linked to specific philological anchors that are passed on through oral or literary means of transmission in any given culture, although the possibility always exists that the motif will pass from one tradition to another (see, e.g., p. 278, n. 19; p. 282, n. 25). Scholem embraces the notion of archetypal thinking and in one place even suggests the possibility of applying a Jungian approach to a particular kabbalistic idea (see p. 289, n. 58). While one example is clearly not enough to collapse the distinction between the approach of Scholem and that of Jung, the fact that he does say of one kabbalistic motif that it contains "something truly archetypal, in the Jungian sense," is instructive of a larger methodological point. Scholem surely would have opposed the notion that there are timeless archetypes that are free of cultural mediation. The historian in Scholem always keeps the phenomenologist in check. ELLIOT R.
