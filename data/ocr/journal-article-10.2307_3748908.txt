<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS The Theological Frontier of Ethics. By W. G. MACLAGAN. (London: George Allen and Unwin; New York: The Macmillan Company, 1961. 202 pp. 28s.) Habituation to conceptual schemes may, Professor Maclagan observes, 'determine our reading of the facts in a way that the facts themselves in their psychological character do not compel'. This reflection may well serve as a comment and caution on his own work. The book presents 'a partial survey of the conceptual frontiers of ethics and theology', and aims at discovering whether 'the essential nature of morality is not such as to require a religious foundation'. Moral experience, in the author's view, consists of two 'moments', moral demand and moral response, the focal concepts involved being that of duty (consciousness of an absolute demand) and that of dutifulness (the willing acceptance of what duty requires). Two central chapters (III and IV) each deal with one of these, and with those theological concepts which one would expect to loom large on a horizon viewed from the standpoint of such a duty-ethic. Thus in Chapter III the theory of God as law- giver is examined and rejected as an answer to the question 'Whence the authority of the moral law?'; and a like fate is suffered by the attempt to ground the 'objectivity of values' in God. The outcome of this is not, as one might have expected, to banish the concept of God from the moral field: on the contrary, this theological concept is viewed as straddling the frontier of ethics and theology. It is in part identical with the moral law ('What, then, can we say but that [the moral law] is God ?'), but not totally, since the aspect of the divine found insepar- able from the object of moral consciousness is not and cannot be that of a personal deity, whereas the religious idea of God contains the idea of a person. Maclagan is unable to give an intellectually satisfactory account of how such disparate elements can be joined in one concept. 'We must', he writes, 'be content to assert, without comprehending, the unity of personal and impersonal natures in God.' But some may wonder what is the value of such an uncomprehending assertion. More interesting are the author's reasons for holding that the God of the moral order cannot be viewed as a person. The nerve of his argument is that in employing the language of person 'we cannot transcend anthropomorphism'. Our talk of will and understanding has positive value only in human contexts, and in these will is measured by law (or good) and understanding by its object, and not vice versa. It follows that the concept of God as a person in whose will or understanding the moral law is grounded cannot be elucidatory for morals. Those who attempt a theistic account of the moral law will be grateful for having this objection put so carefully and clearly in Chapter VI, and for being there reminded of the rele- vance at this point of the doctrine of analogy. This doctrine, as an attempt to work out the conditions under which a concept may be transferred from one realm of discourse to another without losing its positive content and degenerating into mere metaphor, is surely vital to just such an undertaking as the one under review. Yet while indicating his view that the theory is unable to justify the extended use of such terms as 'person' and 'nature' beyond the confines of human beings and their powers, except as 'a despairing "gesture of affirmation",' Maclagan avoids any conclusive criticism of 'this most difficult and debated question'. But it is clearly a crucial question, and it is a pity that he was not able to devote more than 'the space of two or three pages' to it. Why should a duty-ethic insist on retaining such terms as law, authority and 88</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS absoluteness, while denying the possible support of a theistic metaphysic? The answer here is clear. These terms are forced upon us by the facts of moral experi- ence, although this latter is sui generis and we have to be content with 'inadequate metaphor' in describing it. One may wonder just how compelling are the so-called facts which are hinted at by such metaphors, and what sort of psychological explanations of them must be viewed as not doing them justice and why. The author resolutely refuses this task of buttressing his phenomenology of moral experience against the threat of naturalistic dissolution, taking the autonomy of ethics on this side for granted. He accepts the 'consciousness of duty' with its qualities of authority, absoluteness and objectivity at its face-value; it is with moral consciousness viewed in this way that theology must come to terms. The other theological concept considered at length is that of 'constitutive grace'. Maclagan argues (Chapter IV) that the idea of grace regarded as actually opera- tive in man's will, as constitutive of an act of will, is incompatible with the basic requirements of moral response, which is, in essence 'freely dutiful willing'. What may be retained is the doctrine of environmental grace, i.e., that God in ways both external to us and within our nature aids us in fulfilling our duty, in doing what is (morally) good. What must go is the doctrine that without God's acting within a man's will he cannot do his duty, cannot will the good, 'lacks the capacity to live as he should'. This, according to Maclagan, is the doctrine of constitutive grace, and its absurdity lies in its preventing us from making the distinction vital to moral action, between what we do and what happens to us. Some theologians might think this refutation to be off-target: we do not need grace, so it might be argued, to do actions which can be valued as good by other than supernatural standards; we can by our own strength do good actions in the natural order. The doctrine of grace might be held to mean that for such actions to have also heavenly value we must be 'constituted in grace', i.e. enjoy membership of the supernatural order, which is God's free gift to men. The possibility of this further value however does not mean that the terrestrial value of such acts to and for men is not extremely important. But I suspect that the author and many others too want still a third sort of value and significance to ascribe to acts-a value for which the only correct epithet is 'moral' and one which, as they claim, is phenomenologically evident, psychologically compelling.
