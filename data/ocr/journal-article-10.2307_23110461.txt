Pp. xx + 204. $21.00. "Bare lists of words," Emerson maintains in "The Poet," "are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind," and he goes on to report that Lord Chatham would read in Bailey's Dictionary when preparing to speak in Parliament. What sort of speech, one wonders, would Lord Chatham have delivered after reading this somewhat scrambled vest-pocket dictionary compiled by William Carlos Williams? Among of green stiff</page><page sequence="2">430 Criticism, Vol. XXVII, no. 4: Book Reviews old bright broken branch come white sweet May again The reader of imaginative and excited mind has little difficulty recognizing in this bare list of words suggestions of the familiar reverdie: "come / white / sweet / May / again." He must then account for the preceding eight words —two prepositions, five adjectives, and a noun. Here, the title comes to his rescue: "The Locust Tree in Flower." From that ikon, a possible syntax: Among[the] stiff, old, broken branch[es and] bright green [leaves] of [the tree] again come sweet white [blossoms of] May. Ezra Pound was right as always when he told Williams in 1917, "The thing that saves your work is opacity, and don't you forget it." His remark applies precisely as he intended it to "The Locust Tree," for there it stands without metaphysics, without mythology, without tendentious symbolizing. But opaque, too, in a way Ezra didn't intend: the way it solicits the reader's attention to words as words (Among of?), to the poem as thing. Like the Juan Gris painting of a rose he so admired, Williams's "Locust Tree" stands in ap position to nature, emphatically separated from it. Though first published (in this version) in 1934, it would not look out of place in the landscape of Spring and All (1923), a territory colonized by the Objectivists in the early thirties and the writers of "projective" or "open" verse in the fifties. To Pound, Louis Zukofsky, Charles Olson, and Williams himself we are indebted for what we know of "The Locust Tree" as machine. They ne glected to tell us, or tell us only darkly, of the ghost in the machine. The ghost has his book at last, in David Walker's fine study. Walker brings to our attention the peculiar "transparency" of Williams's opacity. By dispensing with an identifiable speaker in "The Locust Tree," by fracturing its syntax, by omitting punctuation and even significant words, Williams invites the reader into the poem to help determine its meaning. The reader thereby usurps the role conventionally played by the persona in the dramatic monologue or lyric, becoming himself the center of dramatic interest. At the same time, he cannot help but notice the extent to which his role has been defined for him by the poet; this "double consciousness" locates him simultaneously inside the poem, as participant, and outside the poem, as voyeur. In the two chapters Walker devotes to Williams, he makes a persuasive case for the "transparent lyric" as a distinctive bridge between Symbolism and the anti-Symbolist "poetics of indeterminacy" which Marjorie Perloff has traced from Rimbaud through John Ashbery, John Cage, and David Antin. One sees with new clarity the principles underlying movements as diverse as</page><page sequence="3">Criticism, Vol. XXVII, no. 4: Book Reviews 431 Imagism, Vorticism, and Objectivism. So tactfully, so modestly does Walker develop his thesis that neither the traditional critic nor the deconstructionist is apt to take offense, and along the way he offers especially satisfying read ings of such poems as "The Sea," "The Sea-Elephant," and "Chloe." I cannot muster the same enthusiasm for the four chapters devoted to Wal lace Stevens, though these manifest the same finesse and include first-rate discussions of poems like "The Motive for Metaphor/' "Someone Puts a Pineapple Together," and "Study of Images II." Compared with Williams's more experimental poems, Stevens's are heavily armored, leaving few syn tactic chinks through which the reader can enter. Their "transparency" is therefore largely a function of their "impersonality." Not surprisingly, Walker concentrates on Stevens's later poems rather than the earlier pieces, which more often employ dramatis personae. Like determinate," "dramatic" is for Walker a relative term, and few will quarrel with his assertion that the Stevens poems he selects are relatively undramatic in the conventional sense: they do not embody the speaking voice in a fully realized persona. Yet the reader is unlikely, I think, to mis take Stevens's meditating consciousness for his own, so idiosyncratic is the diction, imagery, and syntax of the least "personal" of these poems. "The Snow Man" is a case in point: according to Walker, this poem "requires the reader to enter the snow man, to become 'nothing himself' and look out at a blank world through crystalline eyes" (p. 17). This he can do, Walker main tains, because there is no dramatized "I" to inhibit identification with the snow man. But there is such an "I," and he effectively diverts my attention from the scene's nothingness to the possibilities latent in "shagged" junipers and the sound of misery in the wind. He does so, in fact, against my better judgment, since I prefer the snow man's objectivity (though not his nothing ness) to the speaker's facile anthropomorphism. A corollary of Walker s thesis, never fully elaborated, is that critics gener ally misread the poems of Stevens and Williams from an uncritical allegiance to the "expressive" theory of literature—namely, that the work dramatizes some facet of its author's inner life. The transparent lyricist has neither a self to express (the Romantics) nor a medium (Eliot); rather, he seeks to put the reader directly in touch with the phenomenal world or the contours of thought, without interference from his own personality. Thus a Stevens poem which seems to express Stevens's personal uncertainty is actually cal culated to "establish a dialectical network, deliberately unresolved, which it is up to the reader to fulfill" (p. 76). Plausible as this sounds, it doesn't cir cumvent the expressive theory. I am persuaded merely that Stevens has de vised an oblique, stylistically ingenious way to communicate an uncertainty that was once his own. To the transparent lyric as to the conventional dra matic lyric Horace's version of the expressive theory still applies: no tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. These reservations aside, I can recommend David Walker's The Transparent Lyric both to students of the two poets whose work he discusses and to those interested in modern poetic theory. The book demonstrates how much a sen sitive critic can accomplish when armed, as Walker's preface has it, "with no more theoretical ammunition than . . . imagination and common sense" (p. ix). Add to these what Emerson calls "excitement," and one has the com</page><page sequence="4">432 Criticism, Vol. XXVII, no. 4: Book Reviews bination to be seen everywhere in this book, through Walker's transparently readable prose.
