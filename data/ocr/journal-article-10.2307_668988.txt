STEWARD, University of Illinois The Great Basin has a paucity of prehistoric artifacts and settlement sites but an abundance of rock art-pecked, scratched, rubbed, and sometimes painted figures- found on natural surfaces of granite and basalt. Except for a few figures in the south- eastern part of the area, which seem to indicate Puebloid influence, this art has no cer- tain relationship to any prehistoric culture, and its authorship and meaning are un- known to the Shoshonean-speaking peoples who occupied the Great Basin in historic times. The infinitely varied combinations of circles, concentric circles, spirals, squiggly and wavy lines, crude rectilinear elements, and simple anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic figures defy interpretation. In 1929, when the present reviewer undertook to analyze a large number of these seemingly nonsensical representations which were on record at the University of California he could do no more than break them down into recurrent elements and plot the distributions of each. Heizer and Baumhoff have done a prodigious job in carrying the study several steps further. The authors have utilized a vast amount of new material, reanalyzed the art in terms of 58 elements and seven styles, made careful field studies of the locations of many groups of petroglyphs, and suggested a general interpretation of the figures and a chronology of the styles. Most importantly, they show that the art occurs not at settlement sites but along game trails of antelope, deer, and mountain sheep where corrals, blinds, and traps could have been placed. They suggest that it was connected with a collective shaman- istic hunting ritual like the Shoshonean antelope hunt. An association of the art with hunting seems plausible, but the hypothesis of shamanistic rites confronts certain diffi- culties. The Shoshoneans had shamans only in antelope hunts, but none of the rock figures clearly represents an antelope. At least 90 percent of the animals are shown with swept-back horns and appear to be mountain sheep, which the Shoshoneans did not hunt ritually under shamans. None portray jack rabbits, which were the principal object of collective-though non-shamanistic-hunts. Another interpretation, however, comes to mind. Individual Shoshoneans had dreamed powers, many of which pertained to hunting. If hunters depicted their own supernatural powers at the sites of kills the wide diversity of element combinations within generalized styles might be expected. Perhaps, also, the art simply recorded events connected with hunts in a cursive and partly symbolic style, like the Plains Indians' pictographic records. I have always felt that there was something unShoshonean about these petroglyphs, and the authors' dating of the styles suggests different origins and therefore purposes. They tentatively place the laboriously-made geometric pit-and-groove style, which is the oldest to judge by patination, at 3,000 to 5,000 B.C. The Great Basin curvilinear style began perhaps 1,000 B.C., and the rectilinear and representational styles appeared some 1,000 to 1,500 years later when the present Shoshoneans differentiated and dis- persed within the area. To deal with this baffling art requires heroic dedication. Heizer and Baumhoff do not claim to have given us the final word, but their monumental compilations and collations constitute major steps forward.</page></plain_text>
