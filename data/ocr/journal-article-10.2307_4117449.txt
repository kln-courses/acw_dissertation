<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CUMMINGS COLLECTION OF PERUVIAN ART TheArtInstitutehouses today two collections of Peruvian Art which to- gether represent the fin- est group of such arti- facts in existence out- side of Peru. They are the Dr. Eduard Gaffron collection ofwhichparts have been shown during the past two years, and the Nathan Cummings collection recently ac- quired by the noted Chicagoan from a Buenos Aires collector. A selection from the latter is on display in Gallery L 4, some two hundred objects, mainly ceramics, and these mainly the naturalistic Mochica ware of Central Peru. Supplementing are polychrome textiles of ab- stract design and choice ceramics of the coastal Nazca culture, in which the Gaffron group excels. Both collections are here on loan. The Cummings collection (formerly known as the B. J. Wassermann collection) numbers altogether fifteen hundred items spanning per- haps two thousand years in the life of an Andean people whose chronology is little understood today. As admirable as the solidly modelled and precisely decorated vessels are, from an artistic standpoint and an antiquarian's as well, there is inherent in them a still greater value best understood by archaeologists. For herein lies the clue to a mysterious folk who were vanquished in the 16th century leaving no records of their noble past, and who were unknown to Europeans prior to their discov- ery (and quick enslavement) by Francisco Pizarro. A people grown wise in political or- ganization, in precision calculations in the building arts, in hydraulics and highway con- struction; who were elegant carvers and metal- lurgists; who could recite but not write their ancient royal history and dramatic creation myths-these three millions had indeed no written language, no calendar, no alphabet. They did not date their monuments, and their records were but bunches of knotted string (quipus), unknotted and retied when the mes- sage had been delivered, or accounts reconciled. Once fallen, it was too late. The conquista- dors lent no ear to the sages and seers of these wealthy Peruvian people who perhaps wished to relate their proud history for written rec- ord; but instead hustled all the Indians, re- gardless of rank, off to the gold mines and to the treasure troves of the aristocracy, to gather gold for bricks for King Charles. Such a collection as the Nathan Cummings, with its great breadth of coverage in the meaner materials of clay (passed over by the Spaniards as worthless), puts the reconstruc- tion of ancient Peruvian history squarely up to the archaeologist-that master sleuth of our era who writes best sellers about gods and graves and the piecing together of ancient history. It is only in recent years that these imaginative scientists of precise methodology have tackled the Peruvian story. For it re- mains the toughest tackle of them all. The two elements of inquiry upon which the archaeologist counts are missing in the case of Peru. One is a written history or at least dependable related lore, dates, and a calendar count. The other is scientific stratification made at unmolested sites-centers of cere- monial and everyday activity-entered with the sleuth's cautious approach to the unknown. Dr. Gaffron and Mr. Wassermann both bought to please the eye. And their agents exhumed and gathered objects without regard for documentation. Provenances were lost. Objects labeled by name of market place from which gathered, rather than by location of the cemetery or site where found, bring joy to the art lover and dismay to the historian. But here, in the objects now held in great respect by the Art Institute of Chicago, is a chronology of sorts. Colors and figurations 48</page><page sequence="2">give clues to mores and the passage of time. Peruvians are shown as masked and helmeted tribesmen, as participants in ritual real or imagined, as fishermen, hunters, warriors. Por- trait jugs of great fidelity show the Mochican as he looked. Highly conventionalized anthropomorphic figures come and go, early and late. Symbols combine, or disappear. White on red, red on white, black on white-these differences have important chronological meaning. The intriguing stirrup-spout jar that appears in great numbers in Mochica mounds may have featured in trading activities. So constructed that evaporating mists were caught on the horizontal tube and returned by drops to the journeyers' scant water supply, these jugs probably accompanied the highland farmer-ceramicists when they carried wools and dyes to the coastal desert fishermen-weavers, in exchange for textiles desired for burials. Coastal graves, where preservation is more perfect than in the sands of Egypt, have given up rare textiles that took years of sustained and specialized effort to fashion. The Mochica and Nazca cultures flourished in mid Peru for six hundred years, early in the Christian era. Apparently well fed, leisured people, the Mochicans enjoyed their repetitive lives. That is, until attacked by invaders from the direction of Lake Titicaca. Archaeologists put the Tiahuanacan aggression at about 1000 A.D. The sun worshipping, politically socialistic Inca next developed, to harness all of Peru in an empirical rule much admired by Karl Marx some three hundred years after the empire fell to the Spanish wiles of warfare. Thus modern history took over, to still the heartbeats of a free artistic expression of a magnificent people of many skills save only that of the scribe. We are beholden to collectors for the preservation of the key to part of an American culture of lineage extending back to- who knows? Some say to the days when the Bering Straits were solid ice, and primal man mushed across to new hunting grounds, and finally populated the whole of the Americas- to Tierra del Fuego, developing the while into highly cultivated human beings in certain regions. A handbook of the Cummings Collection prepared by Mr. Alan Sawyer, and illustrating over eighty of these handsome objects, is available at the Museum Store and will accompany the exhibition when it goes on tour.
