Tanulm?nyok Luk?cs Gy?rgyr?l {At the Crossroads of Philosophy. Papers on Georg Luk?cs), ed. by Tibor Szab? and G?bor Sz?csi), Szeged - Budapest, Szegedi Luk?cs K?r and MTA Filoz?fiai Int?zet, p. 270. "Luk?cs has always been of interest, but never so much as in Hun gary today" - so wrote Krist?f Ny?ri, Director of the Institute of Philosophy, in the foreword to the volume published recently (1998) by the institute and the Luk?cs Circle of Szeged. He continues: "Luk?cs' career has shown radical turns but no breaks - the focus of his attention remained unchanged. The core of his thought focused on spirituality, culture, and ideals against the background of the superficial and idle world of money." The authors of the volume set themselves the goal of show ing the complex relations between the Hungarian philosopher and other philosophical trends of the twentieth century. The volume con tains eleven papers on Luk?cs' philosophical, aesthetic, and political views. In his paper, Tibor Szab?, the director of the Luk?cs' Circle of Szeged and Professor of Philosophy at the Szeged University, deals with Luk?cs' long road from his early existentialism to his criticism of this same philosophical trend.1 The young Luk?cs, in Szab?'s view, shows not only that he found the philosophy of exist entialism sympathetic, but that he too could be regarded, at that stage of his career, as a philosopher concerned with problems of being, existence. Luk?cs at this time was a philosopher of the tra gic life, of fate, of the "Einzelne." Later, in the early thirties, his sympathy towards existentialism changed to criticism. It was at this point that he became convinced that between the two options of the salto mortale of capitalism and the salto vitale of revolutionary proletarianism the latter has to be chosen. For that reason he starts criticizing the "mystical-irrational" standpoints of Kierkegaard and Heidegger, continuing with a systematic criticism of existentialism between 1945 and 1950, publishing The Crisis of Bourgeois Phil osophy in 1949. He begins by refusing "Wesenschau," the method of phenomenology. His criticism of Sartre's concept is especially poin</page><page sequence="2">342 BOOK REVIEWS ted. Sartre is regarded as the theoretician of "rien," of the isolated individual mind. Luk?cs also refuses Heidegger, especially his Sein und Zeit, saying that it is permeated with anti-humanism and that his concepts of "das Mann" and "Dasein" are deprived of reality. An interesting statement by Szab? is that in this late work, the Ontology, Luk?cs introduced several elements of existentialism, such as the role of decision in human acts, of the "human factor" as an important moment of history. G?bor Sz?csi, member of the Luk?cs Circle of Szeged and of the Institute of Philosophy of Budapest, discusses the epistemological aspects of Luk?cs' criticism of logical positivism.2 Sz?csi attempts to clear up the nature of the epistemological confrontation between Luk?cs and logical positivism rooted in a realism - nominalism opposition. In Luk?cs' view, logical positivist arguments against ontology can be regarded as manifestations of sympathy with the nominalist tradition. Sz?csi tries to show, on the one hand, that the target of Luk?cs' criticism is a special conglomerate of two versions of realism, scientific and internal. On the other hand, he attempts to make clear that scientific realism, which can be regarded as the epistemological background of the radical empiricism of logical positivism, the notion of verification, and the thesis of physicalism, together form a version of ontological, or as Mach, Schlick, and Putnam call it, metaphysical realism that constitutes the epistem ological basis of Luk?cs' Marxist criticism. In Sz?csi's opinion, Luk?cs fails to distinguish between the scientific and instrumentalist versions of neo-positivist arguments against ontology and his con ception is situated by Sz?csi in the various trends of realism in the twentieth century. L?szl? Sz?kely, member of the Luk?cs Circle of Szeged and of the Institute of Philosophy of Budapest, deals with the prob lem of the ontological relevance of science in Georg Luk?cs' late Ontology? It is obvious that in Luk?cs' work, science acquires considerable ontological relevance. The Hungarian philosopher cri ticizes those modern theories which deny the supposed ontological consequences of science. In his reconstruction, the relationship between bourgeois philosophy and the sciences is ambiguous. On one side, science is important for bourgeois society and thought. On the other side, according to him, modern scientific knowledge</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 343 confirms an non-anthropomorphic, materialistic ontology of the cos mos, and this is a disturbing moment for bourgeois philosophy. He claims that the positivist and instrumentalist views of science are brilliant but false ideologies designed to find a way out of this dilemma, and to make it possible for bourgeois philosoph ers to recognize the social-practical importance of science without accepting its materialistic consequences. In this context, Cardinal Bellarmin appears to Luk?cs as a primeval and paradigmatical fig ure of positivism and instrumentalism. But, Sz?kely argues, Luk?cs' interpretation of the Galilei-Bellarmin debate is incorrect. If Luk?cs claims that Cardinal Bellarmin developed his argument against Copernicus' theory because this theory was embarassing for the Catholic Church, then this claim is clearly false, since this argu ment was more than one thousand years old and was directed not to the Copernican but to the Ptolemaic system. Although Bellarmin emphasized this argument to defend the conservative cosmology, supported then by the Church, the argument was more than mere ideology: it reflected real epistemological and technical problems concerning the relationship between mathematics and physics in classical planetary astronomy. Sz?kely concludes that the Luk?csian interpretation of Galilei-Bellarmin debate is not merely an episode in his Ontology, but is a relevant concern to the entire Luk?csian project. J?nos I. T?th, professor of Philosophy in Szeged University, writes about system theory in Luk?cs' philosophy of nature and in I. Prigogine's conception of irreversibility.4 Luk?cs conceived the irreversibility of processes as development or genesis according to the Hegelian interpretation, and he applied this view to inorganic nature. In a modern view, in Prigogine for exemple, the dissipative structures of nature have many common elements in the physical, biological and social world. Zsuzsanna Mate's purpose was to outline and comparatively approach the theories of 'catharsis' in the history of aesthetics.5 She distinguishes three periods in the theory of 'catharsis': the classical period from Plato to Nietzsche, the period of questions, Nietzsche and the young Luk?cs, and finally the weakening period in the twentieth century from S?ndor S?k and Jean-Paul Sartre to the old Luk?cs. The remarks of the old Luk?cs' theory stand at the centre of</page><page sequence="4">344 BOOK REVIEWS her paper, namely the notion of Gattungmassigkeit in Die Eigenart des ?sthetischen, and in the Ontology. Tamas T?th from the Institute of Philosophy of Budapest ana lyses the Hungarian and universal character of Luk?cs' work.6 The Hungarian philosopher was interested mainly in German and French literature (Goethe, Balzac and others), but as a Hungarian he was at the same time a representative figure of European cul ture. T?th says that "Luk?cs is a classic of Hungarian culture, but also a thinker of international horizon." Thus, T?th criticizes the conception that Luk?cs was "ein deutscher Philosoph ungar ischer Nationalit?t." In an other paper, Ferenc L. Lendvai, editor of the Hungarian Philosphical Review, analyses the same ques tion focusing on the earlier philosophical work, History and Class Consciousness.1 He argues that alienation is a central problem in the early social-philosophical thought of the Hungarian philosopher. It is very significant how S?ndor Karik?, secretary of the Luk?cs Circle of Szeged, tries to mark Luk?cs' right place in the history of Marxism.8 In his study, he aims to interpret the problem of Luk?cs' relation to Marx through an analysis of the labour concept hoping to prove that a reading of Luk?cs is not without surprises, new mean ings, and morals even today. In Karik?'s view, "studying Luk?cs has its moral: I regard his oeuvre as a natural part and inheritance from universal conceptual culture, and his relation to Marx manifests the value of paradigm. This paradigm is a lesson on how a follower can imitate his master without giving up his own autonomous way of thinking." An interesting moment in Luk?cs' life, namely his effort to obtain the habilitation at Heidelberg University, forms the centre of Julia Bendl's paper.9 A student of the young Luk?cs' life, the member of the Intitute of Philosophy in Budapest shows - on the basis of original research carried out in the Archives of the University of Heidelberg - how dificult it was for Luk?cs to make his theory of drama acceptable to a large part of the Faculty. Finally, there are two essays on the Luk?cs reception in the Anglo-American world. Tamas Demeter, member of the Institute of Philosophy in Budapest, writes about Luk?cs' influence in Anglo American historiography of philosophy (Lee Congdon and ?rp?d Kadarkay).10 P?ter Farag?, Ph.D. student at the Technical Univer</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 345 sity in Budapest, deals with the reception of Luk?cs in the sociology of knowledge, mainly with the relation between Karl Mannhein and Luk?cs.11 This volume celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the Luk?cs Circle of Szeged. The members of the Circle are scholars who direct a critical eye to Luk?cs' oeuvre. In other words, theirs is not an orthodox Circle, even though they remain convinced that Luk?cs is a "great illuminator" who despite his many mistakes was a great European thinker. All of these papers express the deep conviction that - despite the political changes in Central Europe - Luk?cs's works retain their interest and are still worth examining.
