<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michel Strickmann T H E LO N G E S T TAOIST SCRIPTURE The most imposing scriptural text in the Taoist Canon is the very first. Its full title is Wondrous Book of the Transcendent Treasure, Supreme Stanza on Limitless Salvation, but it is better known simply as the Book of Salvation [Tu-jen ching]. It is composed of sixty-one chapters (chiian), and in the current reprint of the Ming Canon, it occupies thirteen fascicles-far more than any other scripture.1 Its bulk and dominant position in the Canon combine to give the impression that the Book of Salvation is of the very first importance in the Taoist system, and scholars have sometimes taken it for the basic text of Taoism. Yet the circumstances of its composition have remained singularly obscure. The mystery that enshrouds this first scripture in the Canon seems unfortunately to have set a pattern of scholarly reaction to the Canon as a whole. The strange belief that Taoist writings are all anonymous and undatable has needlessly retarded the study of Taoism and inhibited the use of 1 HY 1 (HY refers to the number of a work in the list of the Canon's contents included in the Harvard-Yenching Index to the Taoist Canon, Tao-tsang tzu-mu yin-te [Peking, 1936; reprint ed., Taipei, 1966], pp. 1-37). Though the largest scripture in the Canon, HY 1 is not the longest book; it is surpassed in this respect by several other works, mainly compendia of rituals, but is still one of the Canon's ten largest works. Among scriptures, its closest rival is the Book of the Great Peace [T'ai-p'ing ching], HY 1093. Out of a claimed original 119 chuan, the Ming Canon preserves sixty-seven of this text (ten fascicles in the modern reprint). But strictly speaking, the present T'ai-p'ing ching comprises two separate works, the first a T'ang compilation (ch. 1-10, fasc. 746-47), the second an earlier book (the remainder of the scripture). ? 1978 by The University of Chicago.

A solution to the basic problems concerning the Book of Salvation might well open the way for responsible historical study of the Canon's contents. Since the researches of Ch'en Kuo-fu, the first chapter of the work is known to have formed part of the original corpus of Ling-pao scriptures that came into being at the very end of the fourth century. A member of the prolific Ko family of Chii-jung (Kiangsu), one Ko Ch'ao-fu, was responsible for this voluminous body of celestial literature, though he declared that the Ling-pao scriptures had earlier been revealed to his famous third-century ancestor, Ko Hsiian.2 Recently, Ofuchi Ninji has published a tentative reconstruction of the original Ling-pao corpus. Using T'ang scripture-catalogs from Tun-huang and quotations in early Taoist writings, Ofuchi has established that of the nineteen basic Ling-pao scriptures in existence at the beginning of the fifth century, sixteen are still to be found in the Canon, in states very closely resembling their pristine condition. Of the remaining three scriptures, one, and a fragment of another, are preserved in Tun-huang manuscripts.3 In the Tun-huang catalogs of Ling-pao scriptures, the Book of Salvation is number 15. Ofuchi has found that all quotations from this work in Six Dynasties and T'ang writings correspond to passages in the first chapter of the present text. He has thus confirmed that the first chapter was part of the original Ling-pao literature composed by Ko Ch'ao-fu, who is said to have transmitted the corpus to his disciples in 397.4 There was, however, no evidence in the materials studied by Ofuchi bearing on the remaining sixty chian; they are not documented in Six Dynasties or T'ang sources.5 The Book of Salvation early achieved preeminence among the Ling-pao scriptures, and a commentary was composed on it before 2 Ch'en Kuo-fu, Tao-tsang yiian-liu k'ao (first published 1949), 2d ed. (Peking, 1963), 1:66-71. Ch'en only states that the first chiian represents the original scripture; he describes the remainder as a later elaboration (p. 70). An excellent study of the legendary background and symbolic significance of the Ling-pao scriptures will be found in Max Kaltenmark's "Ling-pao; note sur un terme du taoisme religieux," Melanges publies par l'Institut des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 2:559-88 (Paris, 1960). There are also several studies of the Book of Salvation itself: L. Gauchet, "Le Tou-jen ching des Taoistes; son texte primitif et sa date probable."

Together with the Inner Book of the Yellow Court (which had formed part of the Mao Shan revelations of 364-70) it was a set text on which candidates for the Taoist priesthood were examined before being granted an official ordination certificate.7 A number of commentaries on the Book of Salvation were written during the T'ang, and three are included in a compendious annotated edition compiled in 1067.8 Thus the text maintained its importance in Sung times. In none of these commentaries, however, is there any mention of additional chapters. The object of all the commentators' efforts was the one- volume work, and thus in the second half of the eleventh century the Book of Salvation was essentially still the text in a single chapter that Ko Ch'ao-fu had produced, and in which T'ang postulants had been examined.9 Besides wondering when the sixty-one-chapter version came into being, we must inquire how it came to be placed at the head of the Canon. The first of the Canon's three major divisions is that of Perfection [Tung-chen pu], originally intended to contain the scriptures of Shang-ch'ing, the subject of the Mao Shan revela- tions.10 The Ling-pao scriptures were to be placed in the second, 6 By one Yen Tung. It is included in the annotated edition of 1067, mentioned below. 7 Institutes of T'ang [T'ang hui-yao], ch. 50, p. 867. On the Mao Shan literature, see my articles, "The Mao Shan Revelations; Taoism and the Aristocracy," to appear in T'oung Pao 63 (1977): 1-64 (Japanese translation, "Bozan ni okeru keiji; dokyo to kizoku shakai," in Dokyo no s6goteki kenkyu, ed. Sakai Tadao [Tokyo, 1977], pp. 333-69); "On the Alchemy of T'ao Hung-ching," to be published in A. Seidel and H. Welch, eds., Studies in Taoism and Chinese Religion (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1978); and Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th ed. (1974), 17:1048-49, 1053-54. 8 HY 87. This "four scholiasts" edition draws on the work of the fifth-century commentator, Yen Tung, and the T'ang authors Hsieh Yu-hsi, Li Shao-wei, and Ch'eng Hsiian-ying. Its compiler was the prolific Taoist scholar, Ch'en Ching-yuan (1025-94). 9 There is a reference in the ninth-century writings of Lu-ch'iu Fang-yuan to "the fifty-eight chiian" of scriptures pronounced by the Celestial Worthy, but the author goes on to state that "the essential message is in the Book of Salvation; the remaining fifty-seven chuan describe ritual procedures, precepts and regulations, and historical matters" (HY 393, p. 3a). It is clear that he was referring to the original Ling-pao corpus as a whole, most of which is indeed taken up with ritual directives and legislation for the religious life. 10 The standard work on the structure and history of the Canon is by Ch'en Kuo-fu (n. 2 above). The earliest proto-Canon, compiled in the fifth century, consisted of three "Caverns" (san tung): Perfection, Sublimity, and Divinity. They were intended to contain the sacred literature produced by an elite group of old Chiang-nan families from the third to fifth centuries: in descending order of prestige the Shang-ch'ing scriptures of the Mao Shan revelations (364-70), the Ling-pao scriptures (390s, but claiming a third-century revelation), and the writings of the Three High Lords (San-huang wen, third and early fourth centuries, but purporting to have been revealed in high antiquity). The San-huang texts 333</page><page sequence="4">The Longest Taoist Scripture lesser division, Sublimity [Tung-hsiian pu]. Yet not only does the first, scriptural subsection of Perfection open with an immense Ling-pao text; related Ling-pao exegetical works are also found heading several of the other generic subsections of Perfection.ll The sixty-one-chapter Book of Salvation seems to have deter- mined the present shape of the whole first division of the Canon. Though the overall structure of the Ming Canon is identical with that of its predecessors, the intentions of the compilers of the earliest Taoist collections have been obscured by a seemingly random distribution of the Canon's contents through its three major and four subsidiary divisions. A large share of responsibility for this apparent chaos must be attributed to the great Book of Salvation itself. Answers to our questions on both the origins and classification of the sixty-one-chiian Book of Salvation are to be found in a short text in the Canon, hitherto unnoticed, entitled Formulary for Transmission of Scriptures according to the Patriarchs of the Exalted Divine Empyrean.12 It opens with a condensed reference to the traditional account of the genesis of the Ling-pao scriptures ages ago, in a prior kalpa, when sound first issued from the protoplasmic Brahma-ether, itself the earliest emanation of the primordial Tao. The words of the scriptures were first pronounced by the Venerable of Primordial Commencement (Yiuan-shih t'ien-tsun) before a great assembly of transcendents. They were then bestowed upon the Most High (T'ai-shang tao-chiin), who in turn entrusted them to the August Celestial Perfected (T'ien-chen huang-jen) and a number of perfected of Shang-ch'ing. These latter were directed to apportion the text into chapters and verses, and the result was appear to have represented the old occult tradition of Chiang-nan, prior to the arrival there of the Way of the Celestial Master in the second decade of the fourth century. The other two bodies of literature reflect a synthesis of the Way of the Celestial Master-"Taoism" par excellence-with the traditional learning and practices of Chiang-nan. Each of the Three Caverns was later divided into twelve generic subsections: Scriptures, Talismans, Commentaries, etc. In the second half of the sixth century four supplements were added to the Canon to house four categories of older texts that had not been taken into account by the compilers of the Three Caverns. Thus, sections were opened for the Lao-tzu, the Book of the Great Peace, works on alchemy and pharmacology, and the literature of the Way of the Celestial Master itself. These Four Supplements (ssu fu) have no internal subdivisions. 11 HY 80 is the Book of Salvation in cloud-seal script; HY 87-95 are commen- taries on the scripture, as are HY 147 and 148. HY 219, one of the ten longest works in the Canon, is a compendium of rituals based on the text. All these books occupy positions of the greatest prominence in Perfection, where it might seem by rights that none of them should be. 12 HY 1272. 334</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions a work in sixty chian, corresponding to the sexagesimal cycle. At the head of the work was placed the Book of Salvation.13 When the editing had been completed the finished scripture was stored in the upper palace of Purple Tenuity (Tzu-wei kung) and later transmitted to the Sovereign of Jade Purity in the Divine Empyrean (Shen-hsiao yii-ch'ing), who kept it hidden in a rosy- hued chamber in his Palace of the Eastern Bourne. It was intended that it should be brought down and transmitted in the world of men only at a later age, when the flaming Sung had come to rule and the temper of Great Peace would be abroad. At that happy conjunction the sovereign of the Divine Empyrean would descend into the world to become the ruler of men. While his younger brother was elevated to govern the spirits on high, the celestial lord himself would receive heaven's mandate to rule the nations below and extend over all the earth the transforming influence of the Tao. It was after the jen-ch'en year (IX-draconian) in the period "Harmony in Government" that these destined events would come to pass.14 This jen-ch'en year corresponds to 1112, in the middle of the reign of Sung Hui-tsung, celebrated as a patron of Taoism. The emperor's penchant for Taoism is a commonplace of Chinese historiography, though the subject has never been studied closely.15 We can, however, be rather more precise about the emperor's associations with the religion, and specifically with the sixty-one-chapter Book of Salvation. For Hui-tsung himself was in a sense the founder of the Divine Empyrean, or Shen-hsiao, order of Taoism, from which comes the Formulary that we have been examining. It is of course Hui-tsung that is intended in the text's reference to a theophany. 13 Ibid., p. la. The account of how the Ling-pao scriptures issued forth from the primordial Brahma-sound and concretized out of the aboriginal Brahma-ether is found in the opening passages of the original Book of Salvation, as well as elsewhere in the Ling-pao corpus. 14 Ibid., p. lb. 15 Joseph Needham has already suggested the potential importance of such a study (Science and Civilisation in China [Cambridge, 1965], 4, pt. 2: 500-501; see also Miyakawa Hisayuki, "So kiss to d6ky6," T6kai daigaku kiy6 23 [1975]: 1-10; and my article, "The Thunder Rites of the Sung: Notes on the Shen-hsiao Order and the Southern School of Taoism" [in Japanese], Toho shukyo 46 [1975]: 15-28). Chin Chung-shu has indeed gathered considerable information from secular writings on the Taoists of Hui-tsung's reign, but his work is vitiated by a super- stitious avoidance of the numerous primary sources in the Taoist Canon, which he does not so much as mention ("Lun Pei-sung mo-nien ch'ung-shang tao-chiao," in Hsin-ya hsueh-pao 7, no. 2 [1966]: 323-414; 8, no. 1 [1967]: 187-257). The same objection may be made to the book by Sun K'o-k'uan, Sung Yuan tao-chiao chih fa-chan (Taichung, 1965). 335</page><page sequence="6">The Longest Taoist Scripture The Shen-hsiao order emerged into history in 1116, with the presentation at court of Lin Ling-su. Lin was a native of Wenchow, and it is said that before becoming a Taoist he had studied un- successfully to become a Buddhist monk.16 This may be no more than calumny, for Lin's background and early years are obscure. What is certain, though, is the effect that Lin's discourses had upon the emperor. A considerable number of priests were already in residence at court, and several court Taoists earlier had enjoyed the emperor's confidence. Yet Lin Ling-su surpassed them all in his spectacular success. He was first assigned to do editorial work on Taoist scriptures and liturgies and to assist in the compilation of the History of the Tao.17 But soon he was directing vast ritual pageants and giving monthly lectures in the palace before the assembled nobility and court officials. In a very short time, he had become one of the most prominent and powerful men in the empire. All the sources, secular, Buddhist, and Taoist, agree upon the nature of Lin's primary message, the basic doctrinal pivot of his remarkable ascendancy. He was obsessed with a region of the heavens, or beyond the heavens, called Shen-hsiao. It was central and supreme among the Nine Empyreans (chiu hsiao), and its spirit-administrators controlled the furthest reaches of space.18 16 Sung-shih 462.13a-14b; Annals of the Buddhas and Patriarchs (compiled 1269-71), Taish5 2035, vol. 49, pp. 420b-421c; Comprehensive Chronicles of the Buddhas and Patriarchs (1344), Taisho 2036, vol. 49, pp. 681a-682a. Material on Lin's career at court is also found in the other standard compilations of Sung history, e.g., Li T'ao's Hsu tzu-chih t'ung-chien ch'ang-pien shih-pu, Yang Chung- liang's Hsu tzu-chih t'ung-chien chi-shih pen-mo (ch. 127), and the late but con- venient Hsu tzu-chih t'ung-chien of Pi Yuan (ch. 92-93). There is a long and extravagantly laudatory biography of Lin in the fourteenth-century Comprehensive Mirror of Immortals (HY 296, 53.1a-16a); is has been translated by James Zimmerman in his 1975 Yale University Ph.D. thesis, "Chinese Historiography and Sung Hui-tsung," where a chapter is devoted to Lin's relations with the emperor. The basic source for the Buddhist and Taoist biographies was an account of Lin's career by the Han-lin academician Keng Yen-hsi, written probably not long after the end of northern Sung. Chao Yii-shih (1175-1231) claims to reproduce this text in his Pin-t'ui lu (1.5a-8b). 17 The History of the Tao [Tao-shih] was to be a universal history along Taoist lines. It was to include chronicles of the rulers who had achieved transcendence, from earliest times through the Five Dynasties period; twleve topical monographs on Taoist subjects; and numerous biographies of male and female immortals, chronologically arranged. Taoism under the Sung was to be dealt with in a complementary work, Institutes of the Tao [Tao-tien] (see Ch'en Kuo-fu [n. 2 above], 1:138-39). Neither book has survived, and it is not known whether or not they were ever completed. 18 The term shen-hsiao is already found in the Mao Shan revelations of 364-70: "Driving a whirlwind I dance through the Divine Empyrean / I roll back the mist, with nine suns in my train" (HY 1010, Chen-kao, "Declarations of the Perfected," 13.10b, lines 2-3). It also appears in the fifth scripture of the original Ling-pao corpus, Stanzas of the Nine Heavens on Vitalising the Spirits (HY 318, p. 7a, line 3). "Divine empyrean" and "cloudy empyrean" are familiar expressions in the secular poetry of the Six Dynasties period as well; through the T'ang, the "nine empyrean regions" seems merely to have been an alternative poetical name for the classical nine heavens. 336</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions Hence the other, older Taoist orders, that derived their authority from one or another of the lesser celestial palaces, were all logically subordinate to Shen-hsiao. What is more, Lin was able to demon- strate the relevance of his revelation to the current secular regime. In Hui-tsung he recognized the Jade Emperor's elder son, the Great Lord of Long Life, Sovereign of Shen-hsiao. He had been born upon earth in order to extend the rule of the Tao over all men. Not long after Lin's disclosure, Hui-tsung formally ac- knowledged the justice of the identification by proclaiming himself August Emperor, Lord of the Tao. By this title he was known until the end of his life.19 Lin's stay at court lasted from 1116 to 1119. It is to this period that our Formulary refers when it describes the auspicious con- junction of events as being destined to occur after the jen-ch'en year (1112). The designation of the cyclical combination jen-ch'en as the moment of messianic apocalypse had been determined long before, in the Mao Shan revelations. It was in the basic text of those revelations, the Annals of the Sage Who Is to Come, that the advent of the savior of the world, ruler of gods and men, was fixed for the sixth of the third month in a jen-ch'en year.20 This cyclical con- junction is one of "lifegiving" (hsiang-sheng: the upper component stands in a relation of production to the lower, here Water pro- ducing Wood). It is a sign associated with the Celestial Portal in the northwest, and portrays the opening of the Gate of Heaven (t'ien-men k'ai), most favorable of astrological portents. Though Lin Ling-su had arrived on the scene too late for the crucial year of commencement, he could at least situate his innovations plainly within the waxing curve of the newly born cycle of Great Peace. A new age of the world had begun, and the eternal scriptures were due to be revealed. Taoist scriptural transmission was preceded and ratified by the bestowal on the recipient of a register (lu)-an extract, as it were, from the acts of the heavenly chanceries, giving the genealogy of transmission, confirming the adept in possession of his scriptural treasure, and guaranteeing his transcendent status both in this 19 In the fourth month of 1117 Hui-tsung reprimanded members of the office of Taoist affairs for having used his full title in an official memorial; it was, he stated, to be employed only within the context of the religion. In the same month, Wenchow, Lin's place of origin, was elevated in official status (Sung-shih 21.8a). 20 HY 442, p. 4a. The eschatology of the Mao Shan revelations is discussed in the articles mentioned in n. 7 above. The Hun-yuan sheng-chi, a comprehensive chronicle of the historical apparitions of Lao-tzu, presented to the throne in 1191, significantly concludes with a lengthy extract from the messianic prophecy contained in the Annals of the Sage-immediately after its description of Hui- tsung's Taoist reign (HY 769, 9.49b-52a). 337</page><page sequence="8">The Longest Taoist Scripture world and the next. A work such as our Formulary is naturally as much concerned with the relevant registers as with the scriptures intended for transmission, and the text goes on to describe the Secret Registers of Jade Purity in Exalted Shen-hsiao, in three chuan. They had come into being at the same time as the great scripture itself. Now that the auspicious conjunction was at hand, they were to be entrusted to ministers-transcendent and officers- transcendent for revelation. These functionaries were to turn the original documents, in cosmic script, into the characters in common use among mortals. They subsequently would be responsible for identifying qualified persons on whom the registers, and then the scripture, might be bestowed. These persons would have been foreordained for reception of the scripture, and the celestial emissaries' function was to awaken them to their immortal destinies.21 Lin's penchant for identifying celestial personages at court did not stop with the emperor. He is said to have declared the true otherworldy identities of a number of other persons, members of the imperial family and high officials. What is more, he revealed himself to be an officer-transcendent named Ch'u Hui. He also introduced at court a young Taoist from Kiangsi, one Wang Wen-ch'ing. Wang was destined to continue the Shen-hsiao mis- sion after Lin's return to Wenchow in 1119. Wang's celestial affiliations were patent from the start, for his name is identical with that of the first divinity of the sexagesimal cycle, the con- junction chia-tzu.22 Thus, although the roles reserved for Lin Ling-su and his colleague in the projects of the invisible world were relatively humble, they were nonetheless indispensable. Lin and Wang were the celestial officers alluded to in the Formulary, prophets of Shen-hsiao, by whose mediation its literature and rites were transcribed and revealed to men. The Formulary next names the three grand masters of the scriptural lineage: (1) The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Com- mencement, August of the Void of Jade Purity (Ancestor: tsu- shih). (2) The Primordial August Lord of the Tao, of the Jade 21 HY 1272, p. 2a. 22 Chief of the Six Chia-regents, and leader of the whole sexagesimal host; Wang Wen-ch'ing's name is attested in Taoist sources from the early fourth century on (e.g. HY 1284, Rite of the Yellow Book, p. 12a, line 8). His advent at court is described in the text quoted by Chao Yii-shih (n. 16 above), 1.6b, where his identity with the first chia-regent is made explicit. See also HY 296, Compre- hensive Mirror of Immortals, 53.16b-17a, where Wang's biography follows that of Lin Ling-su. Wang lived from 1093 to 1153. 338</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions Palace of Shang-ch'ing (Patriarch: tsung-shih). (3) The Great Lord of Life Everlasting, Perfect Sovereign of Jade Purity in Exalted Shen-hsiao (Perfect Master: chen-shih). The emperor Hui-tsung was, of course, the third of these. His position therefore corre- sponded to that of ordination-master (tu-shih) in the usual inter- pretation of the term "three masters."23 According to this enumeration the emperor was clearly intended to function as a benevolent master of ordination, initiating all his subjects into the path by which they would achieve salvation. The Formulary proceeds to list the titles of the sixty-one chap- ters, all of which, as the text states, are included under the comprehensive rubric of the Ling-pao Book of Salvation. They correspond exactly to the chapter headings of the present sixty-one- chuan scripture. The text goes on to remark that, according to the statutes of the heaven of T'ai-wei, the secret registers of Shen- hsiao are on an equal footing with those of Shang-ch'ing. Indeed, they are the crown of Shang-ch'ing, and the sacred texts of Shen- hsiao are complementary to the great Shang-ch'ing scriptures, such as the Perfect Book of the Vault of Heaven [Ta-tung chen-ching] and its registers.24 Here we have the rationale behind the placing of the sixty-one-chuan Book of Salvation at the beginning of the Canon as the first scripture of Perfection. For its first recipients this newly revealed text was not merely another Ling-pao scrip- ture. It was in fact the culminating revelation of Shang-ch'ing and so took precedence over all the other texts of that most aristocratic of scriptural lineages. It is for this reason that the Formulary lays particular stress upon the scripture's transmission to the Most High (who reigns in Shang-ch'ing) and the editorial participation of the perfected. The reported efforts of the personnel of Shang- ch'ing, the bestowers of the original Mao Shan revelations that inaugurated, in the fourth century, a new Taoism of the intelli- gentsia, gave credence to this work's claims as the ultimate product of Shang-ch'ing revelation. Its place at the head of the Canon was thus achieved by something like divine right. The subject matter of this copious outpouring of celestial truths is remarkably unified. All sixty-one chapters bear an essentially similar message: they declare that they contain within themselves 23 Since the fifth century the Three Masters have been the Scripture-master (ching-shih), Records-master (chi-shih), and Ordination-master (tu-shih), though the term might also be used in reference to the Celestial Master (Chang Tao-ling) and his two immediate successors. 24 HY 1272, p. 4b, lines 9-10. Though the earlier history of the text is obscure, what in the Sung passed for the Ta-tung chen-ching is found in HY 6. 339</page><page sequence="10">The Longest Taoist Scripture the potential for the salvation of all mankind, living and dead. Recitation of the scripture will assure the immortality of one's ancestors and that of the reciter himself. It will also guarantee the security and prosperity of the state. The great scripture returns again and again to these fundamental themes. The basic literary device employed to this end is reiteration: perhaps the most conspicuous feature of the entire work. Reading through the expanded scripture, we see that all the supplementary twelfth- century material was firmly grounded upon the original fourth- century Book of Salvation, and the sixty new chapters show with what ingenuity the celestial redactors exploited the verbal re- sources of the basic text. Indeed, every chapter is cast in the same form as the original Book of Salvation and contains many identical or nearly identical passages and the same conclusion. Only eight chapters out of sixty-one end with different formulae.25 It is clear that the intended purpose of such a work was liturgical, not philosophical. Readings were instituted within Taoist services- and the scripture is still so used today. When, after perusing its vast extent, we reach at last the final, sixty-first chapter, entitled "Eternally Breaking the Cycle of Rebirths," it comes as no surprise to find that this section is even more closely modeled than any of the preceding upon the original Book of Salvation. After completing a full cycle of sixty chapters, we return once more to the origin-but we have now accomplished a complete recitation and are ready for a definitive cessation of mundane causality, an eternal breaking of the cycle of rebirths, and a new commencement in Great Peace. We may note the delineation of Hui-tsung's salvific role in the scriptural text itself. The original Book of Salvation mentions a "Great Lord of Long Life": Within Perfection there are gods, The Great Lord of Long Life, His Reverence, Wu-ying, The Venerable Po-yiian, The Great Unity, Director of Destinies, T'ao K'ang, surnamed "Harmonious Prolonger." .26 The T'ang commentators quoted in the comprehensive edition of 1067 all interpret the title as designating a spirit within the body. There is good authority for this, especially in view of the company he keeps; all the other spirits mentioned in this passage are out- 25 Ch. 2, 6, 10, 20, 29, 43, 57, and 60. 26 HY 1, 1.lla, lines 6-8. 340</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions standing members of the classic inner pantheon that was in existence by the fourth century. Wu-ying and Po-yiian reign in the Cavern-chamber of the Upper Entity (shang-yiian), in the head; T'ao K'ang has charge of the nethermost of the three divisions of the body, the Lower Entity, the Cinnabar Field behind the navel (Portal of Destiny, ming-men). There he oversees the union of Yin and Yang and guards the embryo of immortality.27 In the sixty-one-chian Book of Salvation one entire chapter is devoted to the Great Emperor of Long Life (Ch'ang-sheng ta-ti chiin). This chapter, 31, entitled "Life Everlasting" [Ch'ang-sheng chiu-shih], describes the Lord of Everlasting Life as a great deity of the macrocosm, dwelling in the empyrean, and attended by a numberless transcendent retinue. This numenon pronounces the chapter on eternal life to the assembled heavenly host. Placed at the center of the great sixty-one-chapter scripture, chapter 31 both reinforces its message of comprehensive salvation and in- scribes the name of its transmitting deity in the very heart of the work. Here we have the Lord of the Tao with whom Lin Ling-su identified Hui-tsung himself. It was as the Sovereign of Life Everlasting that the future emperor had descended from heaven to be born among men, rule over the nations, and make this great scripture known among his subjects. The scriptural message is simplicity itself, the simplicity of absolute conviction, and it is easy enough to see how it was put into practice under Hui-tsung's Taocratic dispensation. The sixty- one-chapter Book of Salvation is to be situated within the em- peror's program of Ling-pao liturgical reform. This had begun earlier, in 1108, with the promulgation of the Rules of the Ling-pao Ritual of the Golden Register.28 Liturgy was among the emperor's lasting concerns; he had himself composed several sequences of hymns, which were to be sung in the course of the rites-and they are still sung in Taoist services today.29 The purpose of the Rite 27 For the lords of the Cavern-chamber, see HY 421, Concealed Instructions for Ascent to Perfection-fourth-century Mao Shan texts edited and annotated by T'ao Hung-ching (456-536)-1.3b.1; 11a.9-10. The stellar Great Unity was no less at home within the inner pantheon, over which indeed he presided (1.4a.4). A description will also be found in Maspero, Le Taoisme et les religions chinoises (Paris, 1971), pp. 384-85. "T'ao K'ang, surnamed 'Harmonious Prolonger,"' is mentioned in the Inner Book of the Yellow Court, a basic Mao Shan scripture from about 365 (K. M.

Thus the distribution of a newly codified redaction of the Golden Register Rites was intended to ensure that a vast chorus of supplication in the interests of the Sung would rise from every corner of the empire toward the heavenly thrones of the anthropomorphic emanations of the Tao. Once the sixty- one-chapter Book of Salvation had been revealed, it is probable that its recitation was incorporated into the Golden Register rites.30 The greatest scholarly project under way during the years of Lin Ling-su's sojourn at court was the compilation and first complete printing of the Taoist Canon. An edict ordering the sub- mission of Taoist texts had gone out at the beginning of 1114; by 1116 much of the basic collation and editing had been com- pleted.31 A manuscript copy of the entire Canon was sent to Fuchow for engraving on blocks. Fuchow had become a center for the Three Caverns for the Golden Register Retreat), compiled by his minister, Chang Shang-ying, probably in 1108, and which includes similar hymns composed by the second and third Sung emperors, T'ai-tsung and Chen-tsung; and HY 607 (Jade-toned Rituals), where musical notation is given. Hui-tsung's hymns are also referred to in our Formulary (HY 1272, p. 5b). 30 With the demise of the empire and the disappearance of official patronage, the scripture's function in the salvation of the dead displaced its other role of assuring the protection of the state. Thus, in present-day Taiwan its recitation forms part of the mortuary Yellow Register rites. 31 Over a century before, in 1008, Chen-tsung had ordered a comprehensive inventory of Taoist writings. The catalog was duly completed in 1016 under the direction of the statesman and Taoist devotee Wang Ch'in-jo (962-1025). Yet the difficult work of classification and arrangement ultimately had to be entrusted to a specialist, Chang Chun-fang. Chang was eventually able to establish a Canon in 4,565 chuan, which was copied out and presented to the throne in 1019; however it was never printed. A valuable by-product of Chang Chiin-fang's work on the Canon was his Seven Slips from the Bookbag of the Clouds [Yiin-chi ch'i-ch'ien] (HY 1026), a comprehensive encyclopedia of Taoist learning. Hui-tsung's compilers of course had access to the already completed Canon of the preceding century, but even from the Ming Canon it is clear how many new works must have entered the collection at this time. When completed, its contents numbered 5,587 chuan. Once the engraving was done the blocks were sent up to the capital (Pien-liang, modern K'ai-feng), where they were eventually confiscated by the Chin Tartars who in time removed them to their own capital at Chung-tu (Peking). Many more texts were collected, and a Chin Taoist Canon totaling 6,455 chuan was printed, ca. 1190-91. The printing of a Yuan Taoist Canon was begun in 1237. It was based on the Chin Canon, with substantial additions, and numbered over 7,800 chuan (we may note by way of comparison that the Ming Canon of 1445 has only 5,305 chuan). During its northern sojourn under alien rulers, certain of the most characteristic texts were expunged from the Canon, doubtless including many of the more explicitly nationalistic works of Hui-tsung's reign. We know that writings by Lin Ling-su figured on the Yuan index expurgatorius of defamatory Taoist works (Ch'en [n. 2 above], 1:168). Yet Hui-tsung's Taoist Canon remained the authoritative model for all later ones. Ch'en Kuo-fu has noted that the texts of many pre-Sung works in the Ming Canon observe Sung taboos, which suggests that the Ming editions ultimately derived from Hui-tsung's printed Canon (ibid., 1:189). 342</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions large-scale religious printing projects; a privately funded engrav- ing of the Buddhist Canon had been carried out there at the Tung- ch'an Ssu from 1080 to 1104, and the engraving of another Fuchow Buddhist Canon had been under way since 1115 at the K'ai- yuan Ssu (also privately sponsored, it was completed only in 1150).32 The Taoist Canon was probably produced in the same format as the Buddhist collections: accordion-style "brahman- volumes" (fan-pen) with five or six seventeen-character columns to each page (or, more exactly, each unfolded surface). This format was maintained by subsequent printed Canons; it is that of the Ming Canon, the only one of the series to have survived. We know of the zealous activities of the governor of Fuchow, Huang Shang (1043-1129). Himself a devotee, he spurred on the collection of texts within his own jurisdiction and drafted his administrative subordinates into the work of editorial revision. The engraving of the blocks seems to have begun at last in 1117.33 The years 1116-17 were therefore a time of feverish activity on the part of Taoist scholars at the capital and in the provinces. The collection of material that had begun in 1114 seems to have accelerated in pace and increased in volume as the time for print- ing approached. Representatives of a variety of movements and organizations strove to present their lore and practices in polished literary form, so that they might stand among the monuments of the religion in the printed Canon. A great number of texts in the present Canon date from Hui-tsung's reign and owe their genesis to the emperor's patronage. Such works testify to the growth of important Taoist organizations in Kiangsi and the southeastern coastal area.34 Hui-tsung's Canon must also have featured promi- nently several works composed by the emperor himself: com- 32 Bukkyo daijii, 5:3188a. Illustrations of the various printed Buddhist Canons will be found facing p. 3190. In format and style of calligraphy, the "northern" Ming Buddhist Canon is virtually identical with the Ming Taoist Canon. It opens with an imperial preface dated 1440; the same emperor, Ying-tsung, dedicated the Ming Taoist Canon in 1445. The Fuchow Buddhist Canon of 1080-1104 differs in format from the Ming edition chiefly in having six, rather than five, columns of text on each unfolded surface. For additional information on printed editions of the Buddhist Canon, see P. Demieville, "Les 6ditions imprim6es du Canon bouddhique," in Choix d'etudes bouddhiques (Leiden, 1973), pp. 223-40. 33 A collection of rituals presented to the throne in 1116 mentions the compre- hensive gathering of Taoist texts from all over the empire, their collation, and the plans for printing (HY 1217, preface, p. la; Ch'en Kuo-fu [n. 2 above], 1:136). Hung Shang's active role in the project is attested in several sources, including the I-chien chih of Hung Mai (1123-1202): chia 6.5a. 34 The main centers in Kiangsi were Lung-hu Shan and, further south, Ko-tsao Shan and Hua-kai Shan. Lung-hu Shan's prominence as the seat of the putative heirs of Chang Tao-ling dates only from the Sung; its effective domination of southern Taoism began during the Ming. 343</page><page sequence="14">The Longest Taoist Scripture mentaries on the Lao-tzu, the Lieh-tzu, and the Book of Lao-tzu's Ascent into the West, as well as hymns for use in ritual, all of which have been preserved in the Ming Canon.35 But the most con- spicuous place must have been accorded, then as now, to the newly revealed scripture in which the emperor's high origins and illustri- ous destiny were clearly set forth. We have seen that Lin Ling-su's earliest assignment on his arrival at court in 1116 was to the edi- torial board concerned with Taoist literature. It seems likely that Lin's first work at court, if he did not arrive already supplied with the text, must have been the transcription of the integral Book of Salvation in sixty-one chapters from the writing of the empyrean regions with which he claimed such close familiarity. The scrip- ture's reported origin with the perfected of Shang-ch'ing and its role as the final unfolding of Shang-ch'ing revelation provided the rationale for its classification on a par with the Shang-ch'ing scriptures. The impending printed edition of the Canon offered the occasion to make its primacy concrete.36 We have seen that the influence of Lin's Book of Salvation is to be detected throughout the generic subsections of the first division of the Canon, in the form of commentaries and ritual elaborations. Certain of these texts are more or less contemporary with the scripture itself, dating from Hui-tsung's reign, and contain in- formation pertinent to an appreciation of the scripture's place in Hui-tsung's Taoist dispensation. Heading the fourth subsection, "Diagrams," we find the Talismans and Diagrams for the Wondrous Book of the Transcendent Treasure, Supreme Chapter on Limitless Salvation, in three chiian. It opens with a preface which, though attributed to the emperor himself, was certainly written by no mere mortal, and if Hui-tsung was its author then he spoke through his empyrean persona. This work is a commentary, with ample supplementary matter, on the first, original chapter of the scrip- ture. Its main interest lies in the explicit Shen-hsiao hermeneutic that it brings to bear on this ancient text, which has here been considerably expanded by the insertion of diagrams, talismans, incantations, hymns, and some exegesis of terms. Whereas the 35 The Lao-tzu, HY 680; Lieh-tzu, HY 731 (the emperor's commentary is also incorporated into HY 732, a collective edition); the Book of the Ascent into the West, HY 666.

The primary use of the great Prajniaparamita-sfitra in Sino-Japanese Buddhism is also liturgical. 344</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions sixty-one-chapter version is an extended series of variations on the fourth-century original, the same text is here developed in- wardly. The scripture's implications have been made explicit, the proper technical apparatus added to the revealed text, and the ancient work prepared anew for liturgical and contemplative use in the light of recently expanded knowledge. The divinely composed preface refers to the years jen-ch'en and keng-tzu, which would correspond to 1112 and 1120, "after the Emperor on High's descent into the world of men."37 At that time, the prevailing cosmic influences will be those of ninefold Yang, and the evil doctrine (hsieh-fa) will be entirely eliminated. Then the true Tao will come into operation and enlighten the multitudes. Within the body of the commentary itself, there is another allusion to the years jen-ch'en and keng-tzu, when "govern- ment will effect a transformation of all in accordance with their true nature, the secrets of heaven will be revealed, and wondrous signs will of a certainty be manifested."38 This statement is followed by two diagrams, one showing the twenty-eight lunar mansions encircling the eight empyrean regions ranged around within them and, at the very center, the Divine Empyrean, Shen-hsiao. The second diagram, on a larger scale, depicts Shen- hsiao within the other eight empyrean regions.39 The text explains how Shen-hsiao controls the primordial breaths that animate the constellations. Later on, a third diagram illustrates the circulation among the nine empyreans of the Brahma-breaths (fan-ch'i), which are mentioned in the original Book of Salvation and from which the Ling-pao scriptures issued.40 The diagram provides a graphic demonstration of the way in which these primaeval celestial emanations, responsible not only for the Ling-pao corpus but for all creation, were inextricably bound up with and regulated by the newly revealed cosmic mechanism of Shen-hsiao. Specification of the year 1120 (in addition to the pivotal jen- ch'en year, 1112) seems to suggest that this text was one of those brought forth by Wang Wen-ch'ing after Lin Ling-su's departure for Wenchow in 1119-if it was not indeed written by the em- peror himself. It was in any case intended as an interpretation of 37 HY 147, preface, p. 2b. The language of this preface, though exalted, is no more extreme than that found in the emperor's own decree announcing his divine mission (Hsi tzu-chih t'ung-chien, ch. 92 [Peking, 1957], 5:2386-87). 38 HY 147 (2.4b-5b). 39 There is a closely related diagram in HY 1209, a Shen-hsiao ritual compilation (2.18b). 40 HY 147 (3.4b-5a). This diagram is also shared with HY 1209 (2.2b). 345</page><page sequence="16">The Longest Taoist Scripture the dramatic events of Hui-tsung's reign, when the celestial lord was present in person among men revealing his long-hidden scripture and diffusing the perfect rule of the Tao. Its mention of the extirpation of the "evil doctrine" is to be understood as referring to the official measures against Buddhism, a policy in which the emperor had been encouraged and abetted by Lin Ling-su.41 It was shortly after Lin's arrival at court that the emperor initiated an active anti-Buddhist policy. Taoist priests had already been given formal precedence over Buddhist monks in a decree of 1107.42 Now, in 1117, Buddhists began to feel the full force of the Taoist pontiff's displeasure. In the second month of that year it was decreed that Shen-hsiao temples should be estab- lished throughout the empire. In them were to be installed images of the Great Sovereign, Emperor of Life Everlasting, and his younger brother, now reigning in heaven, the Sovereign of Ch'ing- hua.43 A number of existing Taoist temples therefore had their titles changed at this time-but in places where no suitable Taoist temple was available Buddhist monasteries were taken over by the secular authorities, Taoicized, and renamed.44 In an edict of the seventh month of the same year monks were exhorted to become Taoist priests of their own volition.45 From the first month of 1119 there was no longer any option before the Sangha. In a decree issued at that time, Buddhist foundations were strictly forbidden to increase or alter any of their tangible assets, buildings, or land. In view of the measures taken against Buddhism by the secular authorities during the T'ang, 41 The decree mentioned in n. 37 above explains that the emperor's descent into the world of men was motivated by his compassion for the Chinese people; he beheld them, in their quest for enlightenment, mutilating themselves in obedience to the dictates of Buddhism. 42 Hsu tzu-chih t'ung-chien, ch. 90 (Peking, 1957), 5:2302. 43 Ibid., ch. 92, p. 2386; Annals of the Buddhas and Patriarchs (n. 16 above), p. 420b. May certain of the extant portraits of Hui-tsung originally have had a ritual function of this kind? 44 Hung Mai's I-chien chih mentions the Chien-fu Ssu, largest of the six great monasteries of Jao-chou (Kiangsi), which was converted into a Shen-hsiao temple at this time; it was restored to its original function at the end of Hui- tsung's reign (ping 11, la-lb; for more on this temple, see ibid., chih-chia 10.3b- 4a). The same source also records the havoc wrought at the P'u-chao Ssu in Ssu-chou (northern Kiangsu) during its occupation by Taoists (third collection, ssu 9.1b). Additional anecdotes will be found in the Annals of the Buddhas and Patriarchs (p. 421b-c). 45 The fullest record of these decrees is contained in ch. 38 of the Hsu tzu-chih t'ung-chien ch'ang-pien shih-pu. They have been summarized by Tsukamoto Zenryu in his study of Hui-tsung's anti-Buddhist policy, "Tokun kotei to kumei docho seisaku," (originally published 1941, reprinted in Tsukamoto's collected works, Tsukamoto Zenryi chosaku shu (Tokyo, 1975), 5:79-92, 82-83. 346</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions such a move is hardly surprising and may seem to represent sound economic sense. Far more extraordinary is the drastic transforma- tion that accompanied it. For these measures were not the prelude to a wholesale persecution of the Sangha, with an enforced return to the laity of thousands of monks and nuns, as had happened under the T'ang. What transpired was rather a grandiose exercise in that classic administrative pastime, the rectification of names. As Taoist priests were called tao-shih, "scholars of the Tao," henceforth monks were to be called by the complementary title "scholars of virtue" (te-shih); they were to be known by their secu- lar names and to adopt Taoist garb and hair style. The historical Buddha was termed "Golden Immortal of the Great Awakening," Arhats styled "immortals," Bodhisattvas "great ones" (ta-shih).46 Interestingly enough, these latter equivalents were already to be found in earlier Chinese translations of Indian texts; in some ren- derings, the work of transposing alien elements into comprehensi- ble Chinese had been done so well that they were open to the charge of distortion from Buddhist purists. Hui-tsung's efforts here sug- gest an attempt to restore an earlier state of genial confusion, conducive to uncritical synthesis and assimilation. There was no question, at that late date, of destroying the alien religion by violence. A more subtle and thoroughgoing sinification could be effected simply by purging it of its more conspicuous remaining alien elements, including all the terminology that maintained its separate identity within the state. Such was the Taoist emperor's wily strategy in this belated counterattack behind the lines of the Buddhist conquest.47 The nominal eradication of the Indian religion was pursued through the terminology of the monastery and cloister (ssu and yiian), which now became kung and kuan, respectively, like the two foremost ranks of Taoist temples. The alterations extended to ritual gestures and to iconography. In ritual and daily greetings, the joined palms of the monks were to be replaced by raised fists and the kowtow, as used in Taoist ritual-and of course in secular court and tribunal procedure, as well. We should recall that Taoist 46 Sung-shih 22.1a; Hsi tzu-chih t'ung-chien, ch. 93, pp. 2406-07; Annals of the Buddhas and Patriarchs, p. 421a. 47 It is instructive to compare this transient bureaucratic policy of submerging Buddhism in the national religion with the better-known practice of feudal Japan, where in the Middle Ages a tolerant aristocracy promoted the discovery of point-by-point correspondences between the imported and native pantheons, and where ultimately a resurgence of conscious nationalism dictated a strict separation of the two religions, much to the detriment of Buddhism. 347</page><page sequence="18">The Longest Taoist Scripture rites were closely patterned on court ritual, and thus there was no essential break in continuity between the practices in use in Taoist temples and those current in the emperor's hall of audience; analogous procedures also obtained in the halls of provincial governors, prefects, and magistrates. To the discerning eye, many Buddhist practices still stood out as truly alien. In addition, the statuary of Buddhist temples was to be draped in the charac- teristic Taoist accoutrements-robe, cap, and hairpin-and all the major Bodhisattvas and patriarchs received new Chinese names. Suggestive of economic concerns intermingling with the heady nominalism, however, is the further directive that bronze vessels and images should be confiscated by the authorities. The sudden abolition of Buddhism by fiat at least settled for a time the prickly economic problem posed by the sale of blank ordination certificates. In 1108 strong measures had been decreed against speculators who hoarded certificates for their own profit. Now, with no more Buddhist ordinations in view, one aspect of this perennial difficulty might be considered solved.48 The most spectacular of the reforms were not of long duration. Lin Ling-su returned to Wenchow in the eleventh month of 1119. In the sixth month of the following year monasteries and cloisters had their original names restored, and in the ninth month the remaining travestied nomenclature was allowed to revert to its original forms. Thus the remarkable program of systematic sinifi- cation that apparently had been elaborated in Lin's fertile brain was permitted to lapse. But it is significant that, in the same sixth month of 1120 that saw the restoration of their former names to Buddhist foundations, a further decree was issued forbidding the acquisition of land by monasteries, and the printing and sale of blank ordination certificates was banned for a period of five years.49 Although the ideological warfare between the Chinese and the Indian religions seems in 1119 almost to have taken on the trap- pings of a music-hall turn, it is nonetheless clear that Hui-tsung was seriously concerned with checking the growth of Buddhism. 48 Though of course it scarcely solved the real dilemma of obtaining a comparable income for the state from other sources. Yet it appears that Taoist documents were also subject to similar manipulations. When in 1112 the prior of a large Taoist foundation near Hangchow requested funds for necessary repairs, he was given 300 blank ordination certificates to dispose of-they were presumably Taoist (HY 781, p. 1.3a). Thus, in 1119 business may really have gone on just as usual, under altered names. (On blank ordination certificates, see Tsukamoto, pp. 83-92.) 49 The ban was subsequently extended for an additional three years (Tsuka- moto, p. 91). 348</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions There was a reason for this over and beyond the obvious economic explanations. The Sung's powerful northern neighbors were alien regimes characterized by strong Buddhist piety. Though soon to be overwhelmed by the Chin, it was with the Liao kingdom that the Sung were most preoccupied, and it was in relation to them that the Chinese dynasty most forcefully asserted its national character. The state religion of the Liao was a Buddhist tantrism, with its center at Lu Shan, standing in the northeast, at the Gate of Demons.50 The buttressing of Taoism against its foreign rival was tantamount to a move in the interests of national security. Lin Ling-su's special animus against the religion is attributed by the secular and Buddhist chroniclers to resentment of the beatings inflicted on him by his master during his early, abortive career as a Buddhist novice. Whether or not there is any truth in this psychological explanation, Lin was able to devise a shrewd anti- Buddhist program that for all its extravagance was still quite practicable and humane. The necessary change of substances, of import to national defense, would be brought about by a change of names. Lin's Book of Salvation was evidently envisaged as striking a definitive blow against the "evil doctrine," a view that to us must seem tempered with both poetic justice and irony-for both the fourth-century text and its twelfth-century expansion were heavily indebted to Buddhism for their central ideas, from their birth among the Brahma-breaths to their eternal breaking of the wheel of rebirths. The Book of Salvation was itself a massive exercise in the acclimatization of Indian concepts and the recti- fication of names. The scripture therefore provided a celestial model and the semantic tactics for proceedings that became official policy in 1119. 50 Lii Shan (its full name, interestingly, was I-wu-lii shan, "Lii Shan of healers and sorcerers") in Liao-ning province, Manchuria, had been recognized as the guardian peak of the north (pei-chen) during the Han, and continuing official offerings to it in that capacity are attested from the Sui onward. The special significance it acquired during Hui-tsung's reign seems to have been responsible for the mountain's perpetuation as a name of power, emblematic of the demon's portal, among exorcists throughout south China. A description of the Northern Guardian Temple at Lii Shan is given by Murata Jir6 in his Manshu no shiseki (Tokyo, 1944), pp. 339-54. In the first quarter of the thirteenth century Lii Shan figured prominently in the genealogy of sorcerers (wu) as narrated by the Fukienese Taoist master, Po Yii-ch'an. Beginning appropriately enough with Satan himself (testimony to the pervasive Manichaean influence in southeast China at that time), Po traced the lineage of heterodox ritual from its transmission to P'an Ku, the King of the Asuras, and Skanda, down to a host of latter-day local divinities, among them the "Ninth Prince of Lii Shai" (HY 1296, Recorded Sayings of Po Yii-ch'an, 1.8b-9a; "The Thunder Rites of the Sung," p. 22). A detailed description of certain "Lii Shan" rites as currently practiced in Taiwan may be found in Liu Chih-wan, Chung-kuo min-chien hsin-yang lun-chi (Taipei, 1974), pp. 207-378. 349</page><page sequence="20">The Longest Taoist Scripture Though there may have been a slackening in the anti-Buddhist offensive after Lin left the court, the emperor did not forsake Shen-hsiao. Lin had devised and set in motion a supple spiritual contrivance that survived his own fall from favor. Shen-hsiao exegesis and ritual continued, under the technical supervision of Wang Wen-ch'ing, until the end of the reign.51 During the reign of Kao-tsung, first emperor of Southern Sung, an attempt may have been made to ban the order; members of the conservative faction at court imputed to Lin Ling-su a large share of responsi- bility for leading Hui-tsung astray and so bringing about the loss of north China.52 Yet Lin's spiritual progeny subsisted in his own city of Wenchow and spread their influence throughout nearby Chekiang and Fukien. Shen-hsiao rituals of the five thunders were of great importance in the prestigious movement that was to be known as the Southern School of Taoism.53 And despite the disas- trous conclusion of Hui-tsung's reign, Shen-hsiao Taoists continued to revere the ill-fated emperor as their founder and lord.54 It was the continuity of the Shen-hsiao lineage that preserved descriptive texts such as the Formulary, which has in turn per- mitted us to date the longest of all Taoist scriptures and determine how it came into being. The Book of Salvation in sixty-one chapters contained a comprehensive message of salvation for all loyal sub- jects of the empire. It was intended as a paean of celestial praise for the ruling house of the Sung, and most particularly for the then-reigning emperor whom it confirmed in his title of Lord of the Tao, Emperor of Life Everlasting. Moreover, when intoned by priests properly ordained according to the newly revealed protocols of Shen-hsiao, in the newly established Shen-hsiao palaces of the Tao throughout the empire, it formed a mighty incantation, 51 The Canon's very longest work, the immense ritual compendium Tao-fa hui-yuan (HY 1210), contains a substantial amount of Shen-hsiao material credited to Wang, as well as some attributed to Lin himself (ch. 198). 52 Keng Yen-hsi's account (n. 16 above) states that in 1126 Hui-tsung's son and successor, Ch'in-tsung, ordered the desecration of Lin's tomb in Wenchow (Pin-t'ui lu 1.8a). In the Annals of the Buddhas and Patriarchs this move is attributed to Kao-tsung, who is also said (by these Buddhist zealots) to have turned Lin's family home into a Buddhist temple (p. 421c). 53 Writing a century after Lin's activities, Po Yii-ch'an, the foremost master of the Southern School, remarked on the extraordinary proliferation of thunder rites in his day. Po signed himself Shen-hsiao san-li, "Unranked Official of Shen-hsiao" (HY 263, Ten Texts on the Practice of Perfection, 47.10b ff.). 54 HY 1209 (Rites of the Purple Book of the Perfect King of Jade Purity in Exalted Shen-hsiao) enjoins Shen-hsiao practitioners to observe the anniversary of the Lord of Long Life's descent into the world of men, the tenth of the tenth month (1.21a). This is the date of Hui-tsung's birth, celebrated during his reign as the T'ien-ning festival (Sung-shih 19.3a). 350</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions destined to guard the realm against its enemies. The Shen-hsiao movement soared to preeminence at a time of intolerable pressure upon the frontiers and gnawing factional stress within. It exalted the threatened imperial house and the reigning emperor, who was at one and the same time the order's founder, supreme pontiff, and object of worship. It was thus that the great Book of Salvation took its place at the head of the literature of the national religion in the printed Canon of Hui-tsung's reign, a position it has held in successive Canons ever since. Contrary to common opinion, I believe that most of the texts in the Taoist Canon can be accurately dated and put into meaningful relation with their original social context. In lifting the veil of mystery from this longest of Taoist scriptures, I hope that more scholars will respond to the challenge posed by the Canon's remaining enigmas.
