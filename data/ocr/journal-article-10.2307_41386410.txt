S. Office of Ed- ucation exists both for those people who have information and for those who want to find it. Its basic objective is to provide information on significant current docu- ments ( reports, articles, monographs, speeches, books, etc.) and to make them readily available through the ERIC Docu- ment Reproduction Service (EDRS). The basic source of information about all cur- rent accessions into the ERIC system is RESEARCH IN EDUCATION , a monthly catalogue which presents bibliographical information, abstracts, and prices. It also announces documents which are available through normal publication channels. The name "Project English" is familiar to thousands of English teachers who have attended NDEA summer institutes, and to thousands more who have read articles in the past few years in the professional jour- nals of NCTE, MLA, and IRA. Project English, officially the English Program of the U.S. Office of Education, was founded in September 1961 and authorized limited expenditure of funds by Congress under Public Law 531. J. N. Hook, the first Co- ordinator of Project English, described the program ("Project English: The First Year," PMLA LXXVII, September 1963, Part 2, 33-36) as one formed to serve all academic levels, to serve teachers of vary- ing competency, to serve students with low, average, and high ability. Since 1961 approximately twenty Curriculum Study and Demonstration Centers have been funded- many of which have developed study units and curriculum designs which are now available. The problem of making these materials available to the public, however, has beset the Curriculum Centers since their first products were completed. Project Directors have made vigorous- and often successful -attempts to interest commercial publish- ers or university presses in their wares to effect widespread distribution. Also a con- siderable number of the study units and curriculum designs were made available to institute participants through the English Institute Materials Center, sponsored by MLA and NCTE. However, the great ma- jority of classroom English teachers have not been able to obtain these materials. Some items will not be released by pub- lishers for several months, even years; some items will not be published at all; some items already have been published, but they are buried in constantly expanding publishers' catalogues. In order to ease these distribution and publicity problems, NCTE/ERIC, with the approval of its Advisory Board and the U.S. Office of Education, has recently completed a booklet describing in abstract form the materials which were produced by the Centers. Moreover, over the past several months, it has been gathering the documents themselves and processing them 764</page><page sequence="2">NCTE/ERIC 765 for inclusion in the ERIC system. All ma- terials which have been completed by the Project English Curriculum Study and Demonstration Centers at this writing are available from the ERIC Document Re- production Service (EDRS) or from com- mercial or scholarly presses. The abstracts of these materials are arranged, in the NCTE/ERIC booklet, by study center and indexed according to descriptive categories. In addition, the availability of each study unit or other kind of document is noted. This booklet, A Guide to Available Project English Materials , may be obtained without charge from NCTE/ERIC, 508 South Sixth Street, Champaign, Illinois 61820. The sup- ply is limited. Abstracts of some of these materials which are of special interest to teachers of English in the elementary school follow. (Although abstracts are not yet available for them, the University of Georgia Cur- riculum Study Center has developed ap- proximately 20 units ranging from 25 to 250 pages for a curriculum in written com- position, K-6. For further information and a price list write to the English Curriculum Study Center, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.)

UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN ТЕ 000 335 Pooley, Robert C., dir. English Language Arts in Wisconsin: A Sequential Growth Curriculum in English Language Arts for the Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve. 1968. EDRS Price: MF-$1.75 HC available for $1.75 from Publication Order Division, Department of Public Instruction, 126 Langdon Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53702. 457pp. This curriculum guide presents, in re- vised and corrected form, three guides pub- lished earlier as experimental editions: Teaching Literature in Wisconsin (1965), Teaching Speaking and Writing in Wis- consin (1966), and Teaching the English Language in Wisconsin ( 1967 ) . Three main divisions of the guide present the literature, speaking and writing, and language pro- grams, each of which contains sections for the primary, intermediate, and junior and senior high levels. Elementary- and sec- ondary-level bibliographies are included for each subject division, and an intro- duction and teaching illustrations are pro- vided for each grade-level section. The literature division contains basic and col- lateral reading lists for each of the four grade levels, and materials concerning the use of the library in the teaching of litera- ture. The division devoted to speaking and writing includes discussions of mechanics and of speech and writing development for the primary and intermediate levels. Sections for the junior and senior high levels include discussions of speech in the language arts, the development of written expression, spelling and mechanics, and student and teacher evaluation of written expression. In presenting the language pro- gram, the guide provides discussions of</page><page sequence="3">766 Elementary English concepts, the development of a classroom dialect, language patterns, vocabulary, and semantics for the elementary levels. The junior high languge section also deals with language origin and grammar, and includes materials of special interest at this level. The senior high section adds usage, dialect study, the historical development of En- glish, and materials of special interest. NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY ТЕ ООО 124 Nesper, Osanna. A Teachers Experience with Composition. 1965. EDRS Price: MF- $1.75 HC-$16.44. 409pp. This course description recounts a fourth- grade teachers experience of motivating and assisting inner-city slum children to develop composition skills and includes the three units she taught: (1) "Learning to Be Specific" and "Learning to Describe Sense Impressions," (2) "Learning to De- scribe People," and (3) "Playing with Words." Individual lessons in these units contain statements of specific aims, de- scriptions of teaching procedures, biblio- graphic citations of writing models utilized, transcriptions or summaries of teacher-class dialogues preliminary to writing, and re- prints of group- and individually-authored student compositions. A general introduc- tion by Wallace W. Douglas and the author's introductions to individual units provide the reader with guidance in under- standing the rationale of the instruction and in interpreting the student composi- tions. HUNTER- GATEWAY ENGLISH ED 015 203 Marcantante, John J. Gateway English : Identification and Image Stories (A Guide for Teachers ). 1964. EDRS Price: MF- $0.50 HC-$3.80. 95pp. The identification story is an original, or adapted, teacher-prepared tale in which students are cast, always sympathetically. The image story is written by the teacher for a class, small group, or individual in an attempt to cast each student in a positive image the student prefers. The student-cre- ated anthology is a booklet of fictional sto- ries, true narratives, or autobiographical sketches written by students and used, with their permission, as one of the reading texts. These three devices for teaching retarded readers are described and illustrated in this guide. They are offered as possible aids within a total reading program, not as the sole components of such a program. Step by step explanations of the prepara- tion, use, evaluation, and sharing of these devices are provided. The necessity for the teacher to know and understand each child is stressed, but the teacher is cau- tioned to avoid assuming the role of psy- chologist. Classroom-tested sample mate- rials are included to illustrate, for possible experimental use, materials popular with students and to encourage teachers to com- pose and adapt their own reading materials. MACMILLAN GATEWAY ENGLISH Materials developed by the Hunter Gate- way English Project can now be purchased from the Macmillan Company for estimated reading levels grades 5-7 (Level I) and grades 6-8 (Level II). Thematically or- ganized literature anthologies designed pri- marily for educationally deprived urban children are entitled: Level I-A Family Is a Way of Feeling, Stories in Song and Verse , Who Am IP, and Coping ; Level II -Striving, Creatures in Verse, Two Roads to Greatness, and A Western Sampler . In addition to the four anthologies, both teach- er and student manuals and a set of two</page><page sequence="4">NCTE/ERIC 767 recordings designed to accompany the an- thologies are available for each level.

EDRS Price: MF-$0.50 HC available from the University of Ne- braska Press, for $1.25 or from the National Council of Teachers of English for $1.25 (Stock No. 06102). 133 pp. The Nebraska Elementary English Cur- riculum is based on the premise that desire to read, understanding of one's native lan- guage, and competence in composition de- velop from a continuing exposure to litera- ture of superior quality. The sequence of literary works and analogous compositions leads the child from an apprehension of the "mythic" and anthropomorphic to an aware- ness of the realistic and analytic. An oral approach to literature is stressed. Children are encouraged not only to enjoy and understand what is read, but also to ma- nipulate language devices themselves through oral storytelling and written com- position. Literature is classified in one of nine "pseudo-genres"- folk tales, fanciful tales, animal stories, adventure stories, myths, fables, other lands and peoples, bi- ographies, and historical fiction. Each of the 70 units in the six grades contains ( 1 ) introductory materials outlining objectives of the unit and relating it to other units, (2) background materials about authors, characters, themes, and style, (3) sugges- tions for inductive teaching procedures, ( 4 ) related composition, language, and poetry exercises and assignments, (5) bibliogra- phies for students and teachers, and (6) lists of audiovisual aids. In grade one, children are introduced to literature in all "pseudo- genres" except historical fiction. Teaching procedures emphasize identification of re- petitive situation and word patterns in lit- erature and recognition of meaning in sim- ple story forms. Drawing upon what they learn from class reading and their explora- tions in language, children are then able to dramatize scenes and compose stories of their own. ED 013 807 A Curriculum for English: Grade 2, Units 13-22. 1966. EDRS Price: MF-$0.50 HC available from the University of Ne- braska Press for $1.25 and from the Na- tional Council of Teachers of English for $1.25 (Stock No. 06111). 113pp. In grade two, development of a sense of language usage and of narrative form and plot is stressed. Such classic folk tales as "Little Red Riding Hood" and "The Three Bears" point out the repetition of plot structure and language found in stories. Fun with language forms is encouraged through the reading of Just So Stories, and an understanding of the myth is fur- thered in "The Golden Touch." Three Aesop's fables are presented for simple an- alysis of common devices and patterns used in fables. Moreover, several Dr. Seuss sto- ries and two adventure tal es- Blaze and the Forest Fire and The Bears on Hemlock Mountain- help students perceive both real and fanciful views of reality. Crow Boy and Caroline and Her Kettle Named Maud illustrate how children today share univer- sal experiences and problems with children of different cultures and different times. As children become familiar with literary methods and begin to recognize rhythmic and phonological patterns in compositions, they are able to create stories of their own, using as models the literature read in class.</page><page sequence="5">768 Elementary English ED 013 810 A Curriculum for English: Grade 5, Units 45-57. 1966. EDRS Price: MF-$0.75 HC available from the University of Ne- braska Press for $1.25 or from the National Council of Teachers of English for $1.25 (Stock No. 06148). 199pp. The curriculum for grade five continues the presentation of literary techniques used to produce works of imagination. In Tall Tale America, "Rapunzel," and other fairy tales, the American and European folk traditions are compared for common stylis- tic and structural devices. A more complex use of techniques used in fanciful stories is seen in the fairy tales of C. S. Lewis and Hans Christian Andersen and in The Bidpai Fables and Jataka Tales from India. The Door in the Wall provides an introduction to the study of symbolism. Building upon previous grade-level units, the reading of five Greek myths furthers students' under- standing of mythic thought and patterns, and The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood prepares children for a later study of epic form. The relationship between subject matter and theme is seen in King of the Wind and The Island of the Blue Dolphins. Children of the Covered Wagon and This Dear Bought Land enhance children's awareness of their historical heritage. In addition, Dr. George Washington Carver, Scientist is read to study a literary type and to enable students to assess the per- sonal qualities of a character in literature.
