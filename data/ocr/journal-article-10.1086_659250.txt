      <p>For a long time, Çatalhöyük (7400–6000 BC) has stood on its own as a remarkably rich concentration of early symbolism, ritual, and art in the Neolithic Middle East. The apparently odd focus on vultures, death, bulls, and breasts has challenged archaeological interpretation. In his foreword to James Mellaart’s (1967:10) book about the site, Sir Mortimer Wheeler described a “curious and sometimes a trifle macabre artistry” that nevertheless distinguishes a site that “represents an outstanding accomplishment in the upward grade of social development.” A wide range of interpretations has been proposed (Cauvin 2000; Clark 1977; Gimbutas 1989; Lewis-Williams 2004; Mellaart 1967; Mithen 2004; Özdoğan 2002). Of course, there are other and earlier sites with art and symbolism (e.g., Jericho, Jerf el Ahmar, Nevalı Çori, Djade al-Mughara), and new discoveries are being made all the time. However, none of these has the concentration of symbolism (at least not the surviving and interpretable symbolism) found at Çatalhöyük. Today, that situation has changed. The site of Göbekli, excavated by Klaus Schmidt since 1994, has an equally or more remarkable concentration of symbolism, ritual, and art starting at an even earlier date (Pre-Pottery Neolithic [PPN] A/B, the early ninth millennium BC).</p>
      <p>It might have been the case that the discovery of Göbekli unearthed a corpus of symbolism very different from that of Çatalhöyük. After all, the sites are very different in both time and place. They are 450 km apart and in different regional traditions, in central and southeastern Turkey (Gérard and Thissen 2002). There are major differences in economy and architecture. The inhabitants of Çatalhöyük depended on domesticated cereals and pulses and domestic sheep and goats, as well as wild cattle, boars, deer, and equids, whereas all the plant and animal food resources at Göbekli were wild species. The architecture at Çatalhöyük is agglomerated individual houses of mud brick, whereas at Göbekli, the buildings are of stone, sometimes of monumental proportions. There are also major differences in the social setting of ritual and symbolism at the two sites: at Çatalhöyük, the art and symbolism occur in domestic houses, whereas at the earlier site of Göbekli, the symbolism is focused in separate “temples.” Yet in comparing Göbekli and other Neolithic sites in Turkey, such as Nevalı Çori and Çatalhöyük, we have been struck by various similarities and contrasts that we would like to explore in this paper. These similarities and differences raise general issues about the role of symbolism in the earliest settled villages or “towns,” our assumptions regarding gendered representations during this time period, and our understanding of constitutions of the human form.</p>
      <p>In this paper we discuss the interpretation of Neolithic symbolism at Göbekli and other key sites in Turkey and northern Mesopotamia (fig. 1) from the perspective of the new research being conducted at Çatalhöyük (Hodder 1996, 2000, 2005<italic>a</italic>, 2005<italic>b</italic>, 2006<italic>b</italic>, 2007<italic>b</italic>). We suggest that current data do not support the traditional ideas of fertility and matriarchy that have long been associated with discussions of the emergence of settled agricultural life. Rather, current data present a picture of animality and phallic masculinity that downplays female centrality. The Göbekli and Nevalı Çori sculptures illustrate that when Neolithic people first crafted monumental images, they chose subjects that focused on imagined beings and dangerous wild animals. We note here that many of the subjects portrayed are carnivorous, flesh-eating species: lions, leopards, foxes, boars, bears, snakes, scorpions, spiders, and raptors. For reasons we will explore below, it was such a suite of symbolism that was in the mind’s eye of the earliest settled villagers and agriculturalists in southeast Turkey, rather than symbolism based mainly on fertility and female reproduction.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Older work was based on notions of the goddess and the bull (Cauvin 2000), with its classical genealogy, but now scholars such as Mithen (2004), Kuijt (2008), Özdoğan (2001, 2002), and Verhoeven (2002) are presenting a series of new interpretations. Our aim here is to stimulate further debate about the symbolism associated with early settled villages. We aim to create a synthetic perspective that has new dimensions and brings together some of the apparently disparate themes found at a diversity of sites over a long period of time. We recognize the marked variation in the symbolism of the Neolithic of the Middle East, and we do not aim to impose a unified account. Rather we want to draw out some productive themes that seem to recur across different media and across a vast swathe of space and time.</p>
      <p>We have organized our account by focusing on three themes, starting with maleness, as we believe that it is important at the outset to move away from the female-centered narratives that have dominated so much discussion of the symbolism of the Neolithic of Anatolia and the Middle East. We then turn to the theme of wild and dangerous animals and then to the theme of piercing the flesh and the removal of animal and human heads. These three themes allow us gradually to build a social account based on notions of continuity, passing down, and duration within which the concept of “history house” plays a key role.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Neolithic Phallocentrism</title>
         <p>An historically strong theme in many discussions of Neolithic symbolism has been the centrality of the female figure to supposed concerns of early agriculturalists with fertility and fecundity (Rudebeck 2000). Such narratives stretch back to biblical accounts and pick up in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European scholarship (Hutton 1997; Meskell 1995). Frazer’s (1922) <italic>The Golden Bough</italic> was a key text and remains influential to this day. Notions of the goddess or mother goddess had a major influence on James Mellaart (1967) in his original account of Çatalhöyük. In recent times, this emphasis has been continued by Cauvin (2000) in relation to the Middle East Neolithic generally (see comments in Rollefson 2008:398, 403, 408). In a similar vein, Verhoeven (2002) imputes that “both women and bulls do seem to be related to vitality, that is, domestication, life-force and fecundity” (251). While we do not seek to replace one metanarrative with another, we do suggest that the phallocentric elements of representational schemas, monumental statues, and material culture have previously been downplayed, particularly in the Turkish Neolithic. By “phallocentrism” we refer to the privileging of maleness as a prime cultural signifier and the centrality of masculinity (both human and animal) as a source of power and authority within the material and symbolic repertoire of the Turkish Neolithic.</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, the current excavations have yielded 12,466 cattle horn cores and horn core fragments, mostly in “special” contexts, defined as installations on walls or in benches, feasting spreads (concentrations of large amounts of bone from one or a few animals, less processed than usual and in a relatively primary context) and caches. Most of the horn cores are very fragmentary and difficult to sex, but Twiss and Russell (2009) show that of the sexable specimens, 71% are male or probably male and 29% are female or probably female. Looking at the faunal assemblage more widely, Russell and Martin (2005) show that females form roughly half the assemblage in the daily contexts of deposition but only a third of the other special categories. This suggests that bulls were preferentially selected for feasts and ceremonies.</p>
         <p>The imagery of wild animals at Çatalhöyük also suggests a strong masculine presence. The wild animals depicted in two buildings in the upper levels (levels V and III in Mellaart’s levels, counted from I at the top of the site to XII at the bottom) were involved in narrative scenes involving hunting, teasing, and baiting wild bulls, wild stags, wild boars, a bear, and a stag. Many of these teased and baited animals are shown with erect penises (e.g., in F.V.1, the best-preserved building showing humans interacting with wild animals, of the 13 large quadrupeds depicted, six have a penis shown; Mellaart 1966). In one scene (fig. 2), the humans interacting with a wild stag are bearded, although in other scenes, gender is not determinable. In the figurine corpus, there are examples of phallic forms (fig. 3). Most of the figurines at Çatalhöyük are small, quickly made, discarded in middens, and of either animal or abbreviated human form without sex characteristics (Meskell et al. 2008). The largest number of figurines are zoomorphic (896), and they extend throughout the history of the site, with the majority being represented by horns (504). Given the importance of bull and wild sheep and goat horn symbolism at the site and given that we have seen that feasting deposits at Çatalhöyük are dominated by wild bulls, it is reasonable to suggest that the maleness of the figurine horns was an important feature of their use. It is clear, on the other hand, that the predominance of the female human form at Çatalhöyük has been exaggerated in much writing about the site. The famous image of a naked woman sitting on a pair of felines is an isolated find, and indeed the number of clearly female figurines is small (40 out of 1,800 so far discovered; Meskell 2007). Moreover, these examples are confined to the upper levels of the site.<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>One of the most surprising and distinctive aspects of the Göbekli data is the lack of female symbolism. As Hauptmann and Schmidt (2007) put it, “in Nevalı Çori and Göbekli Tepe, the Great Goddess remains invisible (cf. Gimbutas 1989)” (72). Female sculptures have not been found at Göbekli Tepe. The most outstanding features of the site are the T-pillars that are occasionally identified as human forms with arms and hands, sometimes with wild animals carved on their surfaces. These stone pillar–beings are arranged in approximately circular fashion around two larger pillars, with these central ones being distinctly larger than the others. The two central pillars are freestanding, whereas the pillars in the circle are connected by quarry stone walls and, inside the walls, stone benches (Schmidt 2007:74). The excavators interpret these pillars as representing stylized anthropomorphic beings of stone. T-pillars, as well as representing or being human forms, may themselves be evocations of the phallus, with an elongated shaft and a pronounced head. They are massive uprights that themselves often have images of wild male animals with penises depicted. The T-pillar shape occurs frequently at Göbekli and at different scales, including very small examples about 30 cm high carved in stone. It is also possible that some of the pillars, with their long shaft and root, resemble teeth, and bared teeth and fangs are a recurrent motif at the site (see below).</p>
         <p>In the main, the T-shaped pillars feature wild and dangerous animals with bared teeth and exaggerated jowls. Most of the wild animals shown in low relief on the pillars have the penis shown (Schmidt 2006). Some of the Göbekli examples of stone animals carved in the round and originally attached to pillars and now in the Urfa Museum also have delineated penises underneath their large stone bodies, even though such surfaces may have been obscured from view. Taken together, there is a close association between male humanlike beings (the T-pillars) and male animals, specifically in their phallic and aggressive aspects. As Verhoeven (2002) has noted, “the basic relation expressed was between humans and male wild animals” (252).</p>
         <p>Near Göbekli at the site of Yeni Mahalle (Urfa), an ithyphallic larger-than-life stone sculpture was discovered and reassembled from four large pieces (Hauptmann and Schmidt 2007). This impressive male figure is depicted naked, apart from a carved necklace or detail, with its splayed fingers pressed outward from the genital area so that the viewer’s attention is drawn immediately to the presence (or absence) of the penis. Testicles were also indicated. One interpretation is that the splayed fingers effectively cover the upright penis. Another interpretation would be that the penis is entirely missing and present only when placed into the rather shallow depression below. Possible red pigment, natural ochre staining, or some form of discoloration marks the area.</p>
         <p>While this impressive example is clearly anthropomorphic, it recalls a parallel stone figure from Adiyaman-Kilisik (found in 1965) that incorporates the T-pillar body shape with sculpted facial features on the transversal of the T (fig. 4). The arms extend to the head of the smaller body on its front side, with its own set of arms and hands. The smaller body is constituted by a penis-shaped relief, and its hands are placed above the empty hole (where a penis could have been inserted). Moving a penis in and out of this slot could have enhanced the sexual element of this phallic being, mimicking masturbation. Other interpretations might be that this combination of penis and orifice symbolizes a hermaphroditic quality, joins maleness and femaleness, or instantiates the possibilities for bodily transformation and change. Whichever interpretation one chooses, the motif of the phallic body overlain by another is striking, and, moreover, this example further substantiates the theory that the T-pillars themselves are anthropomorphic and perhaps also phallic. While the Yeni Mahalle and Adiyaman-Kilisik examples present a remarkable combination and accentuation, in many ways they recall the Egyptian Predynastic figures of the god Min (Bar-Yosef 2002; Kemp 2000), who holds his penis in one hand. We do not wish to argue for direct cultural links. Our comparison here is illustrative in purpose. In many representations, Min holds one arm up as a sign of aggression, the overall effect being one of phallic intimidation. Originating in the Middle East in prehistoric times, according to Egyptian mythology, Min was popular over the millennia as a deity concerned with violence, sexuality, and fertility (he was also associated with a deceased state and depicted in a mummiform shape). Large stone carvings from Coptos (although very different in date in the fourth millennium) look remarkably similar to the Yeni Mahalle sculpture in form and like the Adiyaman-Kilisik example in regard to the prominent hole where the penis could be slotted in and out.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The bottom part of the Yeni Mahalle statue was left in the form of a pillar, which when partially buried made it resemble an upright stela, like those at Göbekli (Hauptmann and Schmidt 2007). Hauptmann and Schmidt suggest that the Yeni Mahalle figure enables further reconstruction of other fragments from Göbekli and that a number of large stone phalluses probably originally belonged to large anthropomorphic sculptures similar to this one. Another stone sculpture from Göbekli, albeit smaller than life-size, shows an ithyphallic male with the erect penis prominently connected (Schmidt 2006). Lending weight to the idea of phallic masculinity, this completed figure consists only of carved facial features and a detailed penis, while the body is rendered simply as a block without arms or legs. Other finds from Göbekli include quite a number of stone pestles that Mithen, Finlayson, and Shaffrey (2005) have convincingly argued have phallic associations in Levantine contexts (see also Garrod 1957; Goring-Morris et al. 2008; Weinstein-Evron and Belfer-Cohen 1993). Nearby Göbekli at a limestone quarry, three reliefs have been recorded, each depicting a 1-m-long phallus with testicles, plausibly considered contemporaneous with the main site (Rollefson 2008:391).</p>
         <p>Possibly linked to this concern with phallocentrism is the depiction of snakes at Göbekli and Nevalı Çori. One highly decorated T-pillar (fig. 5) has two sets of three snake bodies down the length of one front, and snake heads appear along the sides of the pillar’s lower portion. If one accepts that this is a phallic pillar, then the writhing snake bodies could possibly have accentuated the phallicism. Schmidt (2007) interprets the snakes on this pillar as issuing from the stomach or from approximately the same position where one might expect male genitals. Some 266 T-pillars have been found at the related site of Karahan Tepe (MPPNB), some showing carved anthropomorphic arms on a pillar/torso and animal legs, and another features a snake relief like those from Göbekli (Çelik 2000:7).<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The only clearly female image at Göbekli was incised on a stone slab on a low bench, which could have been sat on, inside one of the stone circles from level II, L. 10-71 (fig. 6). Compared to the well-executed carved sculptures and pillars, this is a crude and misshapen splayed figure with minimal facial features, small drooping breasts that hang to the side of the torso, and scrawny arms and legs. Most striking, however, is the exposure of the body, the complete opening up of the naked form. Specifically, the explicit depiction of the genital region, previously unknown in the Turkish and Levantine Neolithic, is marked by an engraved hole that might be interpreted as being penetrated by a disconnected penis. On either side of the penis are incised areas that can be seen as accentuating the penis or perhaps representing emissions from the vagina. Since the splayed figure is the only female portrayal from Göbekli, was on a bench that people may have sat on, and is a passively penetrated figure, one might interpret this as not being a particularly positive rendition of women and as unlikely to be associated with notions of fertility or matriarchy.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The phallocentric focus at Çatalhöyük and Göbekli is seen at other closely related sites such as Nevalı Çori. The focus is found elsewhere in the Neolithic of Turkey, typically on a smaller scale, as demonstrated within the figurine corpus. At Mezraa Teleilat, Özdoğan (2003:517) describes some 94 phallic figurines found in the transitional layers between the PPN and Pottery Neolithic levels. The numbers of these limestone figurines greatly outnumber those of the standing or seated anthropomorphic figures from the same context and suggest a particular focus on male sexuality as denoted by the penis. Recent work in Turkey has attempted to catalogue the many hundreds of phallic figurines for the Neolithic generally (Nergis 2008). Albeit to a lesser degree, early phallic objects and imagery have also been found in the Levant in pre-Neolithic Natufian contexts. “Natufian art also had an erotic element,” seen, for example, in a calcite statuette from Ain Sakhri (Henry 1989:206). The discussion by Mithen, Finlayson, and Shaffrey (2005) of phallic imagery at Wadi Faynan (WF16) in the PPN has already been mentioned. Phallomorphic and male figurines have been noted in the Neolithic across a broad geographical region (Hansen 2007), including the Levant and Middle East (e.g., Ain Sakhri, Salibya, Dhra’, El Wad, Tepe Guran, Nahal Oren, Nemrik, Ain Ghazal, Netiv Hagdud, and Munhata) and Turkey (Göbekli, Nevalı Çori, Hallan Çemi, Cafer Höyük, Gritille Höyük, Mezraa Teleilat, and Çatalhöyük). At Nevalı Çori, more than 700 clay figures were excavated, with male examples slightly outnumbering the female ones (Morsch 2002). The number of animal figurines, a mere 30, pales in comparison (Hauptmann 2007). Importantly, phallic or male figurines are typically outnumbered by geometric, ambiguous, or zoomorphic examples in both Turkish and Levantine sites (see Kuijt and Chesson 2005, table 8.2; Meskell et al. 2008, tables 5, 6). The same could be said for explicitly female figurines. Moreover, Rollefson (2008) suggests that “male figurines also occur in the central and southern Levant, but in some cases the lack of effort to represent male genitalia explicitly may be a reflection of technological problems (for example, in the fashioning of the plaster statues at ‘Ain Ghazal)” (408). Here we note that such technological problems may also apply to showing female genitalia and breasts. The lack of clear sex characteristics on figurines may result from a lack of interest in those characteristics and an interest in other bodily zones (Nakamura and Meskell 2009) or from showing gender in ways such as posture, hair, size, or figurine fabric that are not easily interpretable as gendered today. We have concentrated here on instances where beards, penises, and breasts are shown and have found an increasing documentation of Neolithic male and phallic imagery across both visual and material culture, even if much of the Levantine evidence partakes of a smaller scale than the paintings and sculptures of Çatalhöyük and Göbekli. It would be fair to say that the character of the Turkish materials differs in style and intensity from those of the Levant, yet there are threads of common concern, as we suggest here. We do not argue that the representation of the female is insignificant in the Neolithic of the region, only that it has frequently been overemphasized at the expense of clear and sometimes predominant male imagery.</p>
         <p>The striking monumental imagery at Göbekli, Nevalı Çori, Çatalhöyük, and other Turkish sites, “(albeit on a reduced scale) appears in the central Levant at Jericho, ‘Ain Ghazal, and Nahal Hemar, an area where the plastered skull cult was characteristic of the ritual arena” (Rollefson 2008:404). In making sense of this Neolithic phallocentrism, at least in relation to Turkey, we find that another stele from Göbekli is of considerable importance and discuss it below (see fig. 7). This shows an ithyphallic headless body in association with a bird. This focus on headless bodies and birds is also found at Çatalhöyük, where it is clearly linked to the removal and passing down of skulls of the dead. At Göbekli, too, there seems to be a link between the phallus and the dead. As discussed below, links to the past will be one context in which to make sense of the phallocentrism discussed here.<fig id="fg7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>First, we wish to explore another set of linkages that derive from the frequent association already noted between the explicit display of penises and the portrayal of wild animals. What are the associations of wild animal depictions and installations at Çatalhöyük, Göbekli, and related sites?</p>

         <title>Dangerous, Wild Things</title>
         <p>A distinctive and perhaps surprising aspect of the symbolism emerging from sites such as Göbekli is the focus on wild rather than domesticated animals. At some sites, such as Göbekli, we would not expect domestic animals in the symbolism since the economies of the sites are based on wild animals only. Of course, there may have been increasingly close links between humans and animals well before genetic change was manifest (Mithen 2004). But at other sites, the focus on wild animals continues in the context of the use of clearly domesticated plants and animals. Schmidt (2006, 2007) remarks that all of the beasts depicted at Göbekli were present (though not dominant) in the site’s faunal assemblage rather than representing fantastic creatures.</p>
         <p>We have seen that at Çatalhöyük the narrative paintings show mainly wild animals. Moreover, installations in the houses featured bucrania (wild bull or wild ram and goat skulls and horns with the heads plastered). The teeth of foxes and weasels, the tusks of wild boars, the claws of bears, and the beaks of vultures were placed in protuberances on the walls. We have found a leopard claw and the talons of raptors in burials. While we have seen the preponderance of male cattle bones and horns in special deposits, we have no evidence so far that the claws, teeth, and beaks of other animals and birds were mainly from males, and we do not argue in this paper that violence and danger were associated solely with males. Our interest is more in the overall focus on parts of animals that are dangerous or piercing; there is little symbolic emphasis on femurs, humeri, molar teeth, and so on. It is also the case that dangerous or flesh-eating wild animals and birds are selected for representation. The economy at Çatalhöyük is based on domestic sheep and goats, but these hardly appear in the symbolism. Wild cattle make up 54% of all animal bones in installations and special deposits and 46% of the animal reliefs but only 15% of the faunal remains from domestic, processing, and consumption contexts. Contrast this with domestic sheep, which comprise 56% of the faunal remains and thus the bulk of meat consumption and only 19% of reliefs and 13% of installations and deposits (Russell and Meece 2006, table 14.5). Bones of wild equids do occur on the site and sometimes in special deposits (foundation or abandonment deposits in houses), and depictions of equids are shown on the walls, but they are rare. Russell and Meece note that 6%, 0%, and 1% of the paintings, reliefs, and installations, respectively, at Çatalhöyük are equids. So it is not just that wild animals are being selected for symbolic representation. There are some deer paintings, but deer antlers are rarely used as installations and never as reliefs. There is a particular focus at Çatalhöyük on both wild, dangerous, flesh-eating animals and their sharp, dangerous body parts. It is these that are predominantly brought into the site and installed or portrayed in the houses.</p>
         <p>It can certainly be argued that in Turkey and the Middle East, there was a general interest in the early Holocene in depicting everything that existed in the habitat (Mehmet Özdöğan, personal communication). Within this general frame there is a particular focus on dangerous wild animals or on the dangerous parts of wild animals from very early in the formation of settled villages (Twiss and Russell 2009). Already at Hallan Çemi in Turkey in the eleventh millennium BC, there is an aurochs skull on a wall of a public building, a row of three wild sheep skulls in a public space, and a snake carved from bone (Rosenberg 2007). New findings from the 12,000-year-old Natufian cave site, Hilazon Tachtit (Israel), have revealed the burial of an elderly woman with body parts of a range of dangerous and/or carnivorous animals, including wild boars, eagles, wild cattle, leopards, and martens, as well as a complete human foot (Grosman, Munro, and Belfer-Cohen 2008). At the pre-Neolithic Natufian site of Nahal Oren in the Levant, Noy (1991) found carved stones with incised decoration and animal heads carved on bone handles (e.g., of sickles). Carved bone, bone fragments, and bone sickle hafts representing animals (deer, horses) were also found in Kebara Cave (Garrod 1957). The sickle shafts from El Wad and Kebara are in the form of deer and goat heads (Henry 1989). Fox (<italic>Vulpes</italic> sp.) teeth are widely used as raw materials for pendants (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2002:70). In the Natufian, we see a marked rise in the numbers of raptor talons (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2002:71) and pendants of bone and canine teeth (Henry 1989).</p>
         <p>In the following PPNA (from 9500 to 8500 cal BC), wild cattle imagery is found throughout the southeast Turkey–north Levantine region (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2002). At Tell ‘Abr 3 in Syria, a series of stone slabs line the bench around the walls (Yartah 2005) in building B2. These are polished and decorated with wild animals—gazelles, panthers, aurochs—as well as with geometric designs. The panthers are spotted and highly stylized and look rather like lizards. Bucrania are deposited within a bench, but there are also bucrania on view in smaller buildings, interpreted as houses, at the site. Investigators at Jerf el Ahmar also found a building with four cattle bucrania probably suspended on the interior walls (Stordeur 2000; Yartah 2005). Two impressive stelae some 2 m high in one building seem to represent birds, possibly raptors (Stordeur et al. 2000:40). At Jerf el Ahmar, there is also serpent decoration on the stone slabs of the benches of the large circular buildings (Stordeur 2000), along with a separate depiction of a vulture (for parallel symbolism at Hallan Çemi and Nemrik 9, see Kozlowski 1992; Rosenberg and Redding 2000). In the PPNB, there continues to be a widespread symbolic focus on foxes, wild cattle, wild boars, and birds of prey (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2002:70–71).</p>
         <p>The depictions from Göbekli allow a fuller insight into some of the associations of these lists of wild animals in the Neolithic. The animals shown overlap in great part with those found at Çatalhöyük, but there are differences in emphasis. Çatalhöyük has fewer scorpions and spiders and more cattle. This difference relates to the different subsistence strategies of the two sites, with the latter site seeing the adoption of domestic cattle at least by the ensuing Chalcolithic West Mound. The cultural intensity of such motifs/genres at both sites is suggested by their appearance at multiple scales across the sites. At Çatalhöyük, the images of wild animals occur as both large painted bulls and full-sized bucrania, as well as small figurines. At Göbekli, there are large and small T-pillars, from the monumental to the handheld limestone examples and miniatures less than 5 cm high (Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe 2007:273). To date, there have been no clay figurines discovered at Göbekli.</p>
         <p>However, the Göbekli data resonate with the data from Çatalhöyük in demonstrating not only the salience of wild animals but also the hard, dangerous, pointed parts of wild animals. As already noted, at Çatalhöyük it is the tusks of wild boars; the horns of wild bulls, wild sheep, and goats; the beaks and talons of vultures and raptors; the teeth of weasels and foxes; and the claws of bears and leopards that are brought on-site and installed in walls in houses or worn as attachments on the body (Hodder 2006<italic>c</italic>). The postcranial parts of some of these animals are rarely found on-site (Russell and Martin 2005). Where postcranial elements are brought on-site, as in the case of cattle, it is the skulls and horns that are used in installations. At Göbekli, this same emphasis is seen in the sculptures showing bared teeth and fangs and the snarling heads.</p>
         <p>How can we make sense of all this? Verhoeven (2002:252) suggested that PPNB human-animal linkages were an expression of the wild, dangerous, aggressive dimensions of the domain of nature. We can turn to wider, classic discussions of the role of violent male-centered imagery. For Bataille (1986), violence in ritual creates moments of transcendence. One returns from this “other” world transformed and more able to cope with restraint in society. For Girard (1977), violent symbolic imagery is a way of managing and evacuating the violence generated inside the human community. Most archaic religions show a narrative that involves going through violence to resolution. While animals predate and fight, only humans have vengeance. There is no community unless there is something to prevent vengeance. Vengeance is overcome when a victim is found that all can fight against—then a solution has been found. The frightening god is thus good for community. The bull is made a scapegoat, and society is reformed. Bloch (1992) discusses how in ritual things are turned inside out in some “other” world “beyond.” For him, the violence and symbolic killing take the initiate beyond the transience of daily life into permanent entities such as descent groups. By leaving this life, it is possible to see oneself and others as part of something permanent and life transcending.</p>
         <p>We will return to an argument not dissimilar to Bloch’s, but we are concerned about the imposition of terms such as “violence” and “aggression” to the Neolithic imagery, and we are concerned about the relevance of off-the-shelf theoretical explanations of its social context. We would prefer to try to build more historically specific arguments for the Göbekli and Çatalhöyük material, and we believe that at least for the latter site there are now sufficient data to allow some progress in this direction.</p>
         <p>We can start with the evidence already noted from Çatalhöyük of an association between special and feasting deposits and the bones of wild bulls (Russell and Martin 2005). It is of course possible that male cattle may have been selectively culled as part of an incipient herding/management strategy of the wild cattle population, but for much of the occupation at Çatalhöyük, there appear to be equal proportions of adult males and females deposited overall. The focus on wild bulls shows up only when special and feasting deposits are considered, suggesting a consumption/deposition strategy rather than culling. Peters et al. (1999:40) have demonstrated that at Neolithic sites in southeast Turkey at which all the cattle bones are wild, such as PPNA Göbekli and EPPNB Nevalı Çori, a higher proportion of the remains are from bulls (&gt;60%), whereas at sites with early domesticated cattle, such as Gürcütepe, the ratio of males to females is 1∶5. Without contextual evidence, we cannot say whether these data from Göbekli and Nevalı Çori represent culling or consumption.</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, there is a shift in the upper levels (above level VII) from roughly equal overall proportions of male and female adult cattle to an increase in adult females (Russell and Martin 2005). It is not possible to identify male and female in younger unfused bones, so the increase in adult females may have been the product of increased culling of younger males. Russell, Martin, and Buitenhuis (2005) argued against this interpretation, as it seemed more plausible that the pattern resulted from targeting female and young groups. Male aurochsen tend to be more solitary. Their predominance in feasting deposits and in the paintings and installations seems more likely to represent animals that were harder to hunt.</p>
         <p>Bulls were preferentially selected for feasts and ceremonies at Çatalhöyük. We also see wild animals in large group activities in the paintings (in one case with all the human figures bearded). There could be a social focus on feast providing, perhaps largely involving males, and the memorialization of these events in the house and ritual symbolism. The heads, horns, teeth, claws, and so on could be taken as long-term memories of public events in which prestige was gained. They are the enduring hard bits, as well as being the distinctive elements of particular species. At Çatalhöyük, we have evidence that after a house (building 1) was abandoned, filled in with earth, and rebuilt upon, a pit was dug to retrieve a wall relief from the underlying room (Hodder 2006<italic>c</italic>:146). It also seems likely that the bucrania stacked in houses (Mellaart’s [1967] shrine 10 and in building 52 in the 4040 area; Twiss et al. 2008) were amassed over a considerable period of time. If a building is not burned on abandonment, the bull horns and other installations are often carefully removed, perhaps for reuse in later rebuildings of the house. The splayed bear figures always had their heads and hands or paws removed at closure; evidence for this was bolstered by the discovery of bones from a bear paw encased in plaster (Hodder 2006<italic>c</italic>:199). In the seventh-millennium levels at the nearby site of Pınarbaşı, Baird (2007) has identified small collections of animal bones packaged in plaster that were presumably kept and were perhaps exchanged before deposition. But at Çatalhöyük, very specific or telling parts of animals were kept and passed down from generation to generation. They are the visible, aggressive, dangerous, and ultimately durable parts.</p>
         <p>Can the same be said of Göbekli? Here there is no published evidence of the role of animals in feasting or of the passing down of animal parts. The imagery may be associated with public gatherings in the circular temples of monumental stones. Verhoeven (2002) has warned that “it seems that only a small portion of the entire (settlement) population could be assembled” (245) in the public ritual buildings at ‘Ain Ghazal, Nevalı Çori, Çayönü, and Göbekli. For the latter site, he estimates up to 20–35 people being able to assemble in the buildings at any one time. In our view, these numbers might easily be doubled or tripled, given the size of some of the Göbekli temples (the Double Pillar building is 25 m by 5 m), but even if lower figures are preferred, some unit beyond a small family or group is indicated. We shall see below that there are claims that the Göbekli temples were involved in links to the ancestral dead, but the Göbekli evidence complicates the notion that the durability of parts of animals involved in prowess and feasting was the central focus of the symbolic imagery, as this argument can hardly be put forward for snakes, spiders, and scorpions, although they can often be dangerous. The latter are unlikely candidates for feasting or for memorials of public events, even if they had totemic or some other such marking significance.</p>
         <p>While we argue that the symbolism at many sites focused on the dangerous, distinctive, and durable elements of particular beasts, we also think that other factors may have been involved in the selection of the particular animals and body parts represented. At both Göbekli and Çatalhöyük, birds are depicted. At Çatalhöyük, these are either raptors or cranelike. The overall assemblage of bird remains at Çatalhöyük is dominated by waterbirds, in particular ducks, geese, and ducklike birds such as grebes and coots (Russell and McGowan 2003). Herons and other waders are also well represented, but the art shows a focus on larger birds that eat animal or human flesh. At Göbekli, a wider range of birds is shown. They are at times difficult to identify, but again the focus seems to be on raptors, water birds, and birds with hooked beaks.</p>
         <p>Rather than, or in addition to, the focus on durability and memory construction, the focus on sharp, pointed parts of animals may relate to piercing of the flesh. The role of the equids in the symbolism at Çatalhöyük is interesting, as already noted. In the site’s faunal assemblage, three types of equids have been identified (Russell and Martin 2005): the European wild ass (<italic>Equus hydruntinus</italic>), the onager (<italic>Equus hemionus</italic>), and the horse (<italic>Equus ferus</italic>). While there are several equids shown in the paintings, they rarely occur in special deposits or installations. Herbivores such as the wild goat, wild sheep, and wild deer all have hard, pointed parts that can penetrate the flesh, whereas equids do not. While a hoof can effectively be used to protect, it does not pierce. It is thus of interest that there is considerably less symbolism surrounding equids at Çatalhöyük than surrounding the other wild herbivores (Russell and Meece 2006).</p>
         <p>We have identified a theme of piercing and manipulating the flesh, associated with male prowess and with the construction of memories. At Çatalhöyük, these objects of memories were installed in and passed down in houses that we have come to term “history houses” (Hodder and Pels 2010). In a relatively egalitarian society at Çatalhöyük, some houses became preferred locations for burial beneath the floors, and these houses were rebuilt over more generations than other houses and were more elaborate in terms of installations and fixtures (Düring 2006; Hodder 2006<italic>c</italic>). These history houses amassed objects of memory such as human remains and the hard, durable, dangerous, pointed parts of wild animals. We wish now to expand on this notion of history houses by arguing that they were closely linked to ritual knowledge about body manipulation and the piercing and remaking of the flesh.</p>

         <title>Piercing and Fleshing the Body</title>
         <p>In this paper, we outline a possible set of connections between phallic masculinity, aggressive animality, danger and durability, and, finally, the piercing and manipulation of flesh. Concerning the latter, much of our account of the ways in which human fleshed bodies were treated stems from the more detailed evidence of within-house burial from Çatalhöyük. At present, we lack complementary evidence for burial practices at Göbekli, but we will refer to some relevant imagery from the site, as well as to practices widely understood from the Middle Eastern Neolithic more generally.</p>
         <p>In building 77 at Çatalhöyük, wild bull horns set into pedestals seem to fence off or protect a burial platform in the northeastern part of the main room (fig. 8). The platform was dug into during abandonment, and traces of disturbed human bones were found; we assume that some attempt was made to retrieve human remains in the platform before the building was abandoned and then burned. Above the platform on the north wall of the room, there is a wild ram bucranium with a small niche beneath and with the horns no longer surviving. There is much that could be made of the specific association between bull horn pedestals and a burial platform. Perhaps the horns refer to an individual buried in the platform or to some ancestor of the individuals buried there. Perhaps the power of the pointed bull horns protects the dead. Perhaps both the buried humans and the bulls are ancestors. Whatever the specific interpretation, there are other examples at Çatalhöyük of a close link between humans and cattle, particularly in relation to the construction of histories and memories.<fig id="fg8" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         </p>
         <p>Recently, the most evocative materialization of this connection is demonstrated by one remarkable ceramic vessel that was assembled by Nurcan Yalman in 2007 from fragments recovered from a midden in the 4040 area of the site (fig. 9). There is a human face at both ends of the pot and a bull head on both sides. The moulded and incised human and cattle heads mutually constitute each other: the horns of the bull form the eyebrows or perhaps the hair of the human faces, while the human ears can also form those of the bull when the vessel is turned. Human and bull heads, and to a lesser extent wild sheep and goat heads, are treated in comparable ways in that they are removed from bodies and kept and sometimes plastered in order to symbolically reflesh the skull (Meskell 2008). We have already seen the plaster molding of bull skulls in order to create bucrania and other installations in houses. But what of human heads?<fig id="fg9" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>At Çatalhöyük, there is evidence for the intentional severing of heads in the mortuary data, although the removal of human heads has been demonstrated to occur after death rather than being causal (Molleson, Andrews, and Boz 2005). In the case of human bodies, only a few individuals were treated with head removal. Six (three male and three female) out of 350 skeletons so far excavated by the current project beneath the floors of houses had clear evidence of head removal, though the real proportion is probably considerably higher since most skeletons excavated have been disturbed by later additions into the same grave or platform. In two cases of headless bodies uncovered by the current excavations, cut marks were present, and the heads were probably cut off some time after initial burial (Molleson, Andrews, and Boz 2005). These examples occur in buildings 1 and 6, both good examples of history houses, as defined above, long-lived and rebuilt buildings with many burials (up to 62 burials in building 1). Other examples were also found in probable history houses. In building 60, a woman with a child in the birth canal was found without head, and in building 49, three individuals, including juveniles (L. Hager and B. Boz, personal communication), were found without heads. Individual skulls (male, female, and juvenile) have also been found in abandonment contexts or in foundation deposits (e.g., placed at the base of a supporting house post in building 17). The retention and deposition of human skulls can be argued to be involved in history building. Following removal, human skulls may well have circulated for some time before final interment in specific abandonment or foundation contexts. In 2004, the plastered skull of an adult man (sex based on cranial features) was discovered held in the arms of a woman who had been buried in a pit as part of the foundation of a new building; it is the earliest example of a plastered skull recovered from Anatolia. The facial features, but not the eyes, had been plastered and painted red, perhaps several times (based on the appearance of multiple layers of red painted plaster in a broken cross section of the plaster). These particular treatments and actions of head removal and plastering appear to be directed at certain individuals—possibly deemed as revered ancestors, both male and female—not to collectivities of people, although social groups may have witnessed, or interacted with, curated or plastered skulls.</p>
         <p>Apart from the example at Çatalhöyük, plastered skulls have been discovered at Kösk Höyük in Turkey and six Levantine sites (Bonogofsky 2005; Kuijt 2008; Verhoeven 2002), suggesting the possibility of a long-lived and shared set of bodily practices, although there are many regional and temporal gaps in our evidence that remain to be filled. In the Levant, groups of skulls occur. Bonogofsky rules out plastered skulls as evidence for links to specific ancestors on the basis of the evidence for plastered children’s skulls (e.g., at Kösk Höyük). To dispute that children could possibly be considered as ancestors in the Neolithic does not to take into account the many ritual contexts where children are revered individuals or embodiments of deities and spirits (see also Fletcher, Pearson, and Ambers 2008). The tradition of strictly biological descent from adults is probably only one, very modern, understanding of what constitutes the ancestral. Recent discoveries at PPNB Kfar HaHoresh in northern Israel have revealed the removal of both wild cattle skulls and a human skull; the latter was retrieved some time after (Goring-Morris and Horwitz 2007).</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, the removal of human heads is referred to in several wall paintings from different levels at the site that show vultures, in one case with human feet, associated with headless corpses. We now estimate that most of those inhabiting the site were buried beneath house floors, although excavations off-site in the KOPAL trench discovered disarticulated human remains mixed in with faunal remains. No evidence of vulture disarticulation has been found in the bone remains from on- or off-site, but it remains possible that some bodies were exposed. The symbolic association between death and birds is widely found in the Neolithic of Turkey and the Middle East, and there appears to have been an important and long-lasting narrative within which head removal was associated with birds, especially raptors or water birds. A deposit of vulture, eagle, and bustard wings at Zawi Chemi Shanidar (Simmons and Nadel 1998; Solecki and McGovern 1980) and stones engraved with vulture images, like those at Çatalhöyük from Jerf el Ahmar (Stordeur et al. 2000), indicate that ideas surrounding death, vultures, and skulls belong to a set of practices and preoccupations with remarkable flexibility, endurance, and sociospatial breadth.</p>
         <p>On the Göbekli pillar in figure 7, the two registers highlight the association of birds and a headless human. On the upper register, we see the repeated and stylized motifs of possible structures and plants. Beneath these motifs were carved four birdlike creatures, some having the features of raptors, the others of water birds. Three of the four have humanlike legs that extend out in front, making the creature appear to be in a sitting position. At both Çatalhöyük and Göbekli, the birds that are associated with the headless bodies have human traits or adopt a hybrid human/animal form. The fourth bird image ends in a triangular, snakelike head instead of legs. Of particular interest is the raptor with the neck detail similar to that of the Yeni Mahalle sculpture that appears to be bouncing a sphere in its feathered wing. One possible interpretation is that this sphere or skull belongs to the headless male in the lower register, again reinforcing a connection between death, birds, and a headless human state. On the lower register we see an array of dangerous animals: a scorpion, a snake, a toothy creature of unknown species, and a water bird paired with a decapitated phallic male. The male figure extends an outstretched arm, as if to stroke the bird’s neck, while his penis is also extended toward the lower portion of the neck. While the pillar is damaged in this area and the decapitated man’s legs are missing, it looks as if he is riding or directly positioned on top of the large bird.</p>
         <p>Another striking sculpture composed of four fragments uncovered in the Terrazzo building and other contexts at Nevalı Çori materializes a complex interrelationship between birds and human heads specifically. Described as a composite, free-standing totem pole, the three individuals are stacked one on top of the other, mutually constituting each other’s forms. At the top, a bird perches on two human heads whose hair is detailed in a cross-hatched pattern (Hauptmann and Schmidt 2007). Associated with these heads, two opposing bodies are crouched with their backs toward each other. Hauptmann and Schmidt (2007:67–68) suggest that “their swelled bellies and the depiction of their vulvae may represent pregnancy” and in one case “the bird seems to grasp the human head by the cheeks with both feet.” The latter instance implies a form of violence, or threat of violence, that underwrites many of these monumental projects. Another stone statue of a bird-man was found in an early phase of the Terrazzo building. The excavator interprets this as a hybrid being, a human dressed as a bird, or a bird with a human head in its mouth. In light of the prevalent skull cult documented at Nevalı Çori and other early Neolithic sites, this example—along with the human/bird pillar and the T-pillar with birds and the headless ithyphallic male—supports an interpretation of birds and human heads as a central theme of Neolithic art (Hauptmann and Schmidt 2007).</p>
         <p>The removal of heads is widely found in the Turkish and Middle Eastern Neolithic (seen at numerous sites, including Çayönü; Verhoeven 2002, table 3). It was perhaps at some times and places embedded in a narrative that involved birds and perhaps birds taking away heads. In the Çatalhöyük wall paintings referred to above, Griffon vultures (<italic>Gyps fulvus</italic>) have their beaks poised toward a number of decapitated yet fleshed human bodies. Examining the composition closely, one can see that each vulture’s beak targets the area where the head once was rather than the limbs or fleshy parts of the body. This may lend support to the idea that vultures were associated with head removal and headless bodies rather than with practices of excarnation per se. Moreover, the vultures were often painted red, and their talons were accentuated. The overall effect is of a pointy, bony, and dangerous predator.</p>
         <p>In Mellaart’s (1967) shrine VII.8, some seven vultures swoop on six disproportionately small headless humans, although the burials below the paintings all retained their skulls. Mellaart also claimed that in shrine E.VII.21, four skulls were positioned in direct association with plastered animal parts or paintings. Two skulls were “perched on the corner platform below the vulture painting,” another skull was in a basket below a bucranium on the west wall, and the fourth skull was positioned below another bucranium on the east wall (Mellaart 1967:84). Another fragmentary painting uncovered by Mellaart (1967) was interpreted by him as a human figure between two vultures “swinging a sling in vigorous motion, presumably to ward off the two vultures from the small headless corpse which lies on its left side to his right” (166). Since all that remains of this panel is the artist’s drawing rather than a photograph, we remain circumspect. Vulture skulls themselves were also inserted into the house walls at Çatalhöyük, plastered over into a lump, with the beaks protruding (Russell and McGowan 2003:445). Raptor claws were also curated and deposited, as in a grave in building 75, and another three examples have been found in building 77.</p>
         <p>Besides the narrative art at Çatalhöyük, the figurine corpus similarly reveals a connection to headlessness and may reveal resonances with bird imagery. There is an example of a carved stone figurine that may have represented a vulture or bird of prey (Mellaart 1967:183). More generally, a subset of clay figurines that we label “abbreviated” (Meskell et al. 2008) displays birdlike qualities (beaky pinched heads) that sit atop stylized or truncated human torsos. Additionally, these figurines often have two legs that protrude out in a sitting position, resembling the vulture’s human legs present in the wall painting of Mellaart’s (1967) shrine VII.21. There are also visual similarities between these abbreviated, possibly hybrid figurine forms and the depiction of the seated birds (raptors and water birds) on the Göbekli T-pillar described above. Figurines from sites such as Nemrik display raptor imagery even more strikingly (Kozlowski 2002).</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, many figurines are found without heads, and in one case there is evidence for the intentional severing of a stone figurine head (12102.X1) by cutting, probably using an obsidian blade. We have found numerous obsidian tools that show flattened and abraded edges from working stone surfaces (Karen Wright, personal communication). About a dozen clay figurines have dowel holes, suggesting that the process of removing and keeping heads could be played out in miniature. The ability to remove and replace certain heads might allow for multiple identities and potential narrativization (see Nanoglou 2006, 2008; Talalay 2004). Hamilton (1996) argued that detachable heads at Çatalhöyük “were used to portray a range of emotions, attitudes or states of being” (221). In recent analyses, Nakamura and Meskell (2006) have identified more bodies with dowel holes than heads made for attachment, which could suggest that the head is more determinative and the bodies are deemed more generic, although this may not imply a hierarchy. From the figurines, almost all of the examples with detachable heads are large female forms: 10 are female and depict breasts, two are suggestive of the female form, and one is androgynous. All but one of these examples is corpulent.</p>
         <p>One dramatic example (12401.X7; fig. 10) from Çatalhöyük plays on a possible tension between fleshed and unfleshed. The front portrays a robust female with large breasts and a stomach with the navel protruding. From the arched shoulders, very thin, almost skeletal arms with delineated fingers rest on the breasts. The back depicts an articulated skeleton with a modeled spinal column, a pelvis, and scapulae that project above shoulders. Individual ribs and vertebrae are depicted through horizontal and diagonal scoring. A dowel hole indicates that originally the piece had a separate, detachable head, and the circular depression around the dowel hole suggests that the head fit snugly into this curved space (Meskell and Nakamura 2005). It has previously been suggested that the heads of figurines themselves, especially detachable ones, came to represent real plastered skulls, with their high foreheads and smoothed, minimal facial treatment, minus mouths and detailed features (Meskell 2007). There are interesting parallels at Göbekli, specifically in the carvings of beasts with bared fangs and claws, attached to the large stone pillars described above. Several of these beasts, some still attached, others cut and removed in antiquity, have the same skeletal detail on the back while retaining a fully fleshed belly and underside. Several examples show an erect penis underneath, even when it would have been difficult to view. Like the Göbekli beasts, the Çatalhöyük figurine reveals the bony, skeletal part of the body that survives death (and interment) and explores a tension between embedded bony human parts and a shaped, fleshed, living body.<fig id="fg10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>What we might be witnessing is a concern for the processes of bodily articulation or disarticulation across the Neolithic (see also Bailey 2005; Chapman 2000; Daems and Croucher 2007; Nanoglou 2008; Talalay 2004). As Kuijt and Chesson (2005:177) have observed, the deliberate removal of figurine heads at ‘Ain Ghazal coincides with the practice of skull removal in mortuary practices. The practice of removing, circulating, and passing down of heads at Çatalhöyük is something we have observed across media from the wall paintings and burials to the figurine corpus and is part of repetitive suite of practices. For example, heads of animals in the forms of skulls (bulls, vultures, goats, wild boar jaws) were attached to walls and embedded and “refleshed” with wall plaster, and there is one unclear example of a wall painting showing a headless animal in a hunting scene. N. Russell (personal communication) has noted instances of plastered animal skulls with both plastered horn cores (suggesting more decomposition) and nonplastered horn sheaths (less decomposition). These treatments might indicate different levels of enfleshment; horn sheaths would eventually deteriorate, and it is possible that after this happened, people would then plaster and rebuild the remaining horn core to achieve a similar effect (Nakamura and Meskell 2006).</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, the context for the replastering is the house. Many of the bucrania were placed on structural pillars made of large timbers, themselves frequently replastered and embedded within the house walls. These wooden pillars also were usually retrieved at house abandonment and reused in later rebuildings of the house. These wooden pillars are not needed structurally as supporting beams, and so their inclusion in the house may have a more symbolic resonance, possibly harking back to an earlier time when they were necessary or suggesting an embodied element such as a skeleton for the house that was then plastered over.</p>
         <p>The overall symbolic concern with flesh and its removal can be related to the practical knowledge of flesh and body part manipulation that must have been involved in the human burial process. In building 49, a burial was found in a small grave adjacent to the painted northwestern platform. The head and torso were present, but the arms and legs had been removed. The perfect anatomical position and articulation of the head and torso suggested that the arms and legs had been carefully removed while the bones were still partially fleshed. Lori Hager (personal communication) has noted the extreme care and bodily knowledge that must have been involved in removing the body parts. Not only had the arms been removed but also the scapulae and clavicles—and yet not a single cut mark could be identified, suggesting an almost surgical knowledge and care. The overall bioarchaeological evidence from the site suggests that heads and other body parts were often removed before decay of the flesh, given the anatomically correct positioning of the smallest bones in the body (Andrews, Molleson, and Boz 2005).</p>
         <p>We have already referred to the cut marks found in relation to two of the bodies from which heads had been removed at Çatalhöyük. As people dug below house platforms to make new interments, they came across earlier bodies, rearranged them, and resorted them, and in building 1, there is evidence of secondary reburial of body parts. Skulls were removed and sometimes painted in red ochre, and in the case noted above, the facial features were remodeled in plaster. Daily practices at Çatalhöyük involved detailed knowledge of the human body and its flesh. However, in particular, as we have seen, some houses became repositories for more burials than others, and all the cases of headless bodies so far found can be said to be from these history houses. Groups of houses may have been associated with the houses in which people were preferentially buried and in which individuals had special knowledge of bodily manipulation. As noted above, we have little evidence for the role of burial in the temples at Göbekli, but Schmidt (2006) has proposed a mortuary function on the basis of the evidence of mortuary associations for the buildings at Jerf el Ahmar and Nevalı Çori (Hauptmann 2007; Stordeur 2000).</p>
         <p>The theme of bodily manipulation as a component of the social process of history making can be seen to link together many of the themes discussed in this paper. Manipulating human bodies involved piercing, cutting, and handling flesh. Birds are shown pecking the flesh from headless human corpses. In the symbolic repertoire of wild animals, the focus is on their claws, talons, horns, tusks, fangs, and stings that pierce or tear flesh. The sharp body parts are kept and hidden in plaster on house walls. The wild animals are often male, with erect penises, and in one case, an erect penis is associated with a headless corpse and with the bird theme. Clay figurines from Çatalhöyük also show the piercing or stabbing of animal bodies in a number of cases (Meskell 2007; Russell and Meece 2006), typically the fleshy parts of cattle, equids, and boars.</p>
         <p>What, then, of the tools involved in piercing the flesh? Many of the most finely flaked daggers from Çatalhöyük were made of flint. Two flint daggers have been found with bone handles, one depicting a boar’s head (from building 3; Stevanovic and Tringham 1998) and the other a snake (Mellaart 1967). The largest proportion of flaked stone points was made of obsidian (Carter, Conolly, and Spasojević 2005). The elaborate, bifacially flaked projectile points occur in a wide range of contexts, including graves, and they functioned as arrowheads, spear points, or knives/daggers. It is a remarkable fact that in the Middle East as a whole, elaborate, large bifacially flaked projectile points are not associated with late Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic sites. During these later stages of hunting and gathering, the focus was on light arrowheads made with small microliths (Henry 1989) and short blades in the PPNA (Bar-Yosef 1981; Gopher 1994). Bifacially flaked large points become more common in the PPNB (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2001); that is the period in which there was heavy dependence on domesticated sheep and goats and in which the symbolic elaborations around dangerous wild animals, the dead, and piercing the flesh reach their height. However, large bifacial chipped tools are most common in the seventh millennium, for example, PPNC and Pottery Neolithic Levant, just as at Çatalhöyük. These points may well have played their role in protecting domesticated flocks from wild animals; they may be herders’ tools. Some may have been used as knives to cut up domestic animals. But some points may have played a part in the confrontation of wild animals as part of social and ritual ceremonial and in the processing of human flesh; the more elaborate flint daggers with carved handles are most likely to have been involved in this way.</p>
         <p>Finally, we wish to mention another possible association of this suite of symbolic themes and practical engagements. If a key theme is indeed the piercing of animals and humans and their refleshing, then we might expect a focus on blood and its symbolic potentials. The color red is used extensively at Çatalhöyük. Lower portions of walls are often colored red, especially in relation to burial platforms, entrance ways, and thresholds. Red hands are depicted on walls. Many burials include scatterings of red ochre. Red paint was applied around the neck of a headless figurine, representing both the fleshed body and the skeletal body. Moreover, the claws of the pair of leopards in Mellaart’s (1967:119) shrine VI.B.44 were repeatedly painted red, as were the mouths, and red paint was applied onto the heads and snouts of animal installations in other houses. Taken together, we might suggest that the piercing and manipulation of human bodies, as well as the depiction of dangerous animals, was connected to the color red and possibly the representation of blood at Çatalhöyük.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>We do not wish to downplay the interesting differences in the symbolism of Çatalhöyük and Göbekli. For example, more herbivores (equids, cattle, deer) are shown in the symbolism at Çatalhöyük and fewer foxes, snakes, spiders, and scorpions. This may relate to the different subsistence strategies of the sites and the different landscapes in which various forms of wild animals dominated. Irrespective of these differences, there remains a focus on the depiction of wild, dangerous, or predatory beasts. However, there are also important social and economic changes that occurred between the two sites, particularly in relation to the increased dependence on domesticated plants and animals and the shift from public to domestic ritual. Equally, there are important changes within the sites. For example, at Çatalhöyük, the focus on animal installations in houses predominates in the earlier (pre–level V) buildings, while the focus on fleshy figurines with removable heads predominates in later (level V and above) levels. There seems to be a breakdown in the centrality of the history house themes and practices in the upper levels for reasons that remain to be explored (Düring 2006), and the same may be true of other sites in the Neolithic of the Middle East as the distinctive long-lived PPNB sites decline and transformation occurs into the Pottery Neolithic.</p>
         <p>We do not wish to downplay these regional and temporal variations. The polycentric nature of the Neolithic in the Middle East has become abundantly clear over recent decades (Gérard and Thissen 2002; Mithen 2004; Özdoğan and Başgelen 1999), but it is clear that a suite of themes involving skulls and birds of prey, wild cattle, and other dangerous animals and masculinity circulated over enormous areas of the Middle East during the period in which people settled into large villages or towns and adopted agriculture. The similarities between Çatalhöyük and Göbekli and in material culture we have drawn with other sites suggest a very long-term and very far-flung set of myths, ideas, and orientations, even if there were many local variations. These interconnections need to be set in the context of other similarities and interactions over the area in the Neolithic, especially in the PPNB: intramural burial, stone tool types, obsidian, and shell exchange.</p>
         <p>At one level, we see the similar symbolic themes as linked to the processes of settling and forming long-term villages, with all the dependencies on social structures that these villages imply. The long-termness involved delayed returns, and it was produced by the focus on constructing histories, as seen in the history houses at Çatalhöyük and the repeatedly reused and replaced temples at Göbekli. Hodder (2007<italic>a</italic>) has elsewhere described the rebuilding of houses in place as a widespread theme of history making from the Epipaleolithic to the PPNB throughout the region. At another level, the focus on history making involved daily practices of living on and over human remains, the circulation of body parts, and the cutting and remaking of flesh. There was some equivalence of human and animal heads, the latter perhaps as mementoes of significant social events at which largesse and status were built around the killing and distributing of wild animals.</p>
         <p>At Çatalhöyük, the longer-lasting history houses were preferentially involved in the obtaining and passing down of male cattle horns, resulting from feasts and other events in which dangerous wild animals were involved. They amassed more of these mementoes, and they were preferentially involved in the processing of human flesh and skeletons and the associated ritual knowledge. The manipulation of the human body was an important part of history making. If the social and ritual events, such as teasing, baiting, killing, feasting on, and passing down wild animals, often had a phallocentric focus, both males and females were equally involved in the construction of histories and were equal participants in the building of memories (as seen in the removal and circulation of human heads). At Göbekli, we can as yet say little about the social role of the symbolism, except that it again probably took place in relation to ancestry and the construction of histories in the frequently replaced and long-lived temples.</p>
         <p>There is little evidence that all this was couched in terms of a nurturing female or a mothering goddess linked to the fertility of crops. Imagery of a nurturing female is absent from Göbekli, and it is all but absent from Çatalhöyük. Equally, there is little to no symbolic focus on domesticated animals or domesticated plants at Çatalhöyük. Grain bins or pots are not decorated in the main sequence at the site. The process of domestication of different species of plants and animals was long and drawn out in the Middle East, but some genetic changes are visible in PPNA, and by the mid-PPNB, there is a full suite of domestic plants and domestic sheep, goats, and dogs available, with regional variation in terms of pig and finally cattle domestication (the latter in the seventh millennium BC). The symbolic concentrations on masculinity; wild, dangerous things; and circulating human flesh and bone in houses and buildings occurs before full domestication at Göbekli and in the Natufian and continues on coincident with the increased use of domestic animals, the increased stability and continuity of houses, and the increased focus on the creation of histories into the PPNB generally and into the Pottery Neolithic at Çatalhöyük. It seems, then, that domestication occurred in the context of societies thoroughly engaged in building histories around their manipulation of nondomestic species. The ability to kill a dangerous wild animal or a large wild bull, to use and overcome its masculinity, and to control the distribution of its meat and mementoes was as important to creating the agricultural revolution as domesticating plants and animals. The knowledge of how to pierce animal and human flesh and disarticulate and reflesh human bodies and skulls was as important to creating the long-term dependencies of agricultural societies as the storage of grain and the management of herds. An intriguing possibility that needs further exploration is that the forces that fueled more intensive use of plants and animals were social processes involving maleness, dangerous wild animals, and the piercing of human flesh.</p>
