<plain_text><page sequence="1">Research Abstracts Research in the History of Religions 1947-1948 CHARLES S. BRADEN Northwestern University The harvest in the field of the History of Religions in 1947-1948 is meager. A disproportionate share of that which has appeared has been upon Islamic sub- jects. Indeed, if the articles written by Moslems them- selves were eliminated from the list, the Islamic articles would be comparatively few. Why is this? A part of the explanation may be the inaccessibility of some magazines to the abstracter in which articles upon other fields might appear. Yet this same situation existed last year and the score was much better. It would appear that there simply has not been much activity in this particular field. There has been a wealth of material of non-research character on Indian religions in Indian periodicals, and anyone who has access to the Review of Religion, pub- lished by the Columbia University Press, can find a list of such articles in the successive numbers of that jour- nal. These may prove on occasion more valuable to the teacher of the History of Religions than some of the more technical research articles which are abstracted. It is not surprising that there has been little done on Japan because of the peculiar situation existing there; but why there should be so little on China and India is not easily explained. As European journals become more regular in their appearance in our libraries, we may hope for more articles from European scholars. Apparently not enough scholarly work is being done by American students of the History of Religions. The field definitely needs some additional stimulus to make it adequately productive. I. CHINESE RELIGIONS J. J. L. Duyvendak, "The Philosophy of Wu Wei" (Etudes Asiatique, Nos. 3/4, 1947, pp. 81-102). A study of the principle of Wu Wei or non-action in Chinese thought as it appears in Lao Tzu's, Tao Teh Ching and the writings of Chuangtzu, against a cosmo- logical background in which Wu Wei is identified with the character of the way or Tao itself, and in which Te, virtue or power is of magic potency. On its indi- vidual side, lasting vitality becomes purpose and result of the practice of Wu Wei and is quite amoral. Applied to a prince, he becomes pacifist. The amoral nature of Wu Wei leads practically, the author thinks, to the Fa-chia or School of Law. Never put into full practice, the theories of that school lie back of the policy of Chin Shih Huang-ti, who unified China in 221 B.C. and destroyed the Confucian classics. It finds its place in later Chinese society "never to force things, to allow everything to follow its own natural course, to interfere as little as possible with situations that will straighten themselves out-that is Chinese political wisdom." Robert Des Rotours, "Confucianisme et Chris- tianisme" (Sinologica, Vol. 1, pp. 231-245). After a brief discussion of Confucius, the Confucian classics, and the elevation of Confucius to the rank of deity, the author traces the attitude of Christianity toward Chinese rites regarded as religious. From the time of Father Ricci who admitted freely the practice of certain customs which he did not regard as directly con- trary to Catholic dogma, the changing attitude of the church is followed to the present. Condemned in 1742 by the Vatican, the rites were prohibited to Catholics until recently, when on the understanding that certain of the rites in connection with Confucius were not re- garded as religious, in 1939 the church greatly modified its position to permit Chinese Catholics to engage in celebrations in honor of Confucius under certain con- ditions which are given in detail. A good risumz of the attitudes of the present government toward Con- fucius appears. Incidentally, Protestant attitudes are also indicated. The West has much to learn from the Chinese, thinks the author, who finds the doctrine "du Juste Mileu" one that so-called Christian Europe greatly lacks. "Contemporary Chinese Cults," by Clarence Burton Day. Far Eastern Quarterly. Vol. 1, pp. 294-99. 1947. A report based on field work carried out by the au- thor and students at Hangkow University in China. They sought to find out at first hand what the ordinary householder wishes to obtain for himself and family through religious practices. Most frequently reported 120</page><page sequence="2">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 121 were (1) desire for protection of life and property; (2) adjustment to the natural forces of the environment; (3) peace and harmony in home life; (4) success in the struggle for a decent livelihood; but also, (5) salvation from a very definite and horrible hell and the attain- ment of heaven. Emma Louis Benignus, "Current Religious Trends in China" (Journal of Bible and Religion, Vol. XV, pp. 199-205). A brief resume of what is happening in and to the various religions in China. Confucianism still remains the dominant cultural force-in the main ra- tional and humanistic in character- ancestor worship persists except among a small minority. Buddhism, despite the apparent disrepair of many of their build- ings, still exerts a powerful influence on Chinese life. Taoism is decadent in its popular expression, and academic in its philosophic phase. Islam shows sur- prising vitality as does Christianity, being influential out of all proportion to its numbers. Roman Catholic Christianity displays unusual vigor and has a strong leadership. Suggestions are made as to what must be done if Christianity is to make an appeal to the Chinese people. Some surprising evidences of inter-faith co6peration are indicated. Charles S. Braden, "Christianity and the Non- Christian Religions in the Contemporary Era-The Re- ligions of China and Japan" (Iliff Review, Vol. V, No. 2, pp. 50-61). After a brief discussion of the three major attitudes of Christianity toward non-Christian faiths, illustrated by actual situations in the present mis- sionary activity of the churches, the author turns to survey contemporary attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese to Christianity today. Interesting inter- faith relationships appear in China, and in Japan there seems to be an open door of opportunity to Chris- tianity if its leadership is wise. II. RELIGIONS OF INDIA Edmund D. Soper, "Christianity and the Non- Christian Religions in the Contemporary Era-The Religions of India" (Iliff Review, Vol. V, No. 4, pp. 111-121). Dr. Soper bases his article chiefly on D. S. Sarma, Studies in the Renaissance of Hinduism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, and is really an extended book-review article on that important book, enriched, however, by much wise and interesting com- ment growing out of the writer's wide reading on and acquaintance with Hinduism and India-to which he has gone, after retirement from Garrett Biblical Insti- tute, for a three years' period to teach in the Leonard Theological Seminary in Jubblepore, India. III. ISLAM C. R. Avery, Jr., "Moslem Life in Turkey Today" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 185-191, 1947). A some- what popular description of Moslem life as seen chiefly in modern Istanbul after almost a quarter of a century under the modem Turkish reform government which disestablished Islam as the religion of the state. Richard N. Frye, "The Rl1e of Abu Muslim in the Abbasid Revolt" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 28-38, 1947). The author concludes, on the basis of a lengthy argument, that Abu Muslim, a missionary of the Abassids to Khurasan where the revolt against the Umayyad caliphate first achieved success, "was not pro-Iranian or anti-Muslim, but loyally pro-Abassid and a good Muslim. He was first a political man, whose objective was the overthrow of the Umayyad power, and at the beginning he probably was not too particular who helped him." He finds no evidence "that Abu Muslim himself tried to make a fusion of Islamic and Iranian beliefs." Jno. E. Merrill, "Dr. Bell's Critical Analysis of Quran" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 134-148, 1947). A lengthy summary and critical review article on Dr. Richard Bell's The Quran, Translated with a Critical Re-arrangement of the Surahs (T. &amp; T. Clark, Edin- burgh, Vol. I, 1937; Vol. II, 1939.). An excellent description of Dr. Bell's scholarly method, and a reasonable criticism thereof. Sulaiman Nadvi, "The Sovereignty of Allah" (Islamic Culture, Vol. 22, pp. 237-249, July, 1948). "None can command except God," declares the Koran; therefore, Allah alone is the real supreme master in Islam. But there are two kinds of commands of Allah: those which have been revealed as Shari'at through the holy prophet and those which are vested inherently in the creation of the universe, the so- called natural laws. These are illustrated in numerous ways from the Koran and the traditions, and the im- plications drawn for contemporary life. Abdulhak Adnan Adwar, "Islam and Western Thought in Turkey" (The Middle East Journal, Vol. 1, pp. 270-280, July, 1947). Traces the interaction be- tween Islamic and western thought in Turkey from the eleventh century until the present. After an early attempt by the conqueror of Constantinople, Mehmet, to create a true interaction of Islamic and western culture, little was done to bring them together until the 18th century, and that with little lasting result. The first extensive interaction came with the new Turk movement in 1908. Western books began to be translated into Turkish, and western philosophy and comparative religion were introduced into the Uni- versity of Istanbul. This provoked an Orthodox reaction. In 1923 the caliphate was abolished and the canon law abolished. The new republic replaced Islamic dogma with positivistic dogma, so there was still no free interaction of Islamic and western thought. As late as 1946 a committee of government consented to a discussion of the problem of the teaching of modern catechism, an event regarded by the author as of supreme significance, for within the last twenty years no such discussion has been possible in political</page><page sequence="3">122 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS or even in cultural gatherings. Does this herald the approach of a period of freedom within which western and Islamic thought may indeed freely interact one upon the other? Frank Rosenthal, "The 'Muslim Brethren' in Egypt" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 278-291, 1947). A brief description of the contents of a pamphlet Da 'watuna (Our Propaganda Aims), published by a reli- gio-political group in Egypt, the al-Ikhwan-al-Muslimun, founded by Hasan al-Banna' in 1929. Part of an attempt to acquaint the masses with the aims of the movement; "to make the organization attractive to as large a number as possible and to explain and evaluate modern political life from the point of view of popular Islam." The movement was said to have half a mil- lion sympathizers in Egypt in 1945. Interesting modern trend in Islam. Dr. Erwin G. J. Rosenthal, "Some Aspects of Is- lamic Political Thought" (Islamic Culture, Vol. 22, pp, 1-17, Jan., 1948). A study of certain aspects of Islamic political thought, including the theory of the Khilafah or Caliphate in Orthodox Islam, following the exposition of Al-Mawardi. The author discusses political theory among Moslems as seen from various points of view. He deals first with the Caliphate, following the exposition of the Orthodox Al-Mawardi. He then looks at the problem of government, whether by a Moslem ruler or not, of how to govern, here follow- ing a book by Ibn-at Tiqtaqa for "him who governs the people and directs the affairs." Averroes, or Ibn Rushd, represents the philosophical approach, which regards the ideal state as a nomocracy rather than a theocracy. He ends with a discussion of the views of Ibn Khaldun, the systematic philosopher of history, who sees the Shari'a as only one important factor in the state and its natural development. "He realized for the first time in history the principal importance of a stable economy, etc." M. Saghir Hasan Al-Musumi, "Rational Outlook as Obtained in the Thought Process of the Sahabah" (Islamic Culture, vol. 22, pp. 119-127, April, 1948). The author attempts to assess the amount of rational- ization that entered into the differences of opinion held by the Sahabah, or Companions of the Prophet, those who actually knew and associated with him during his life time, on the various fundamental theological problems, such as: the unity of God; anthropomorph- ism; the beatific vision; the irrevocable decree of Allah, etc. His method is to quote and interpret the extant sayings of the Companions on these topics. These have been of great influence in the building of Islamic jurisprudence and thought. Joseph Somogyi, "Buda in the Days of Islam" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 214-223, 1947). Hungary for four centuries was the "shield of Christianity'" against Moslem attacks upon Christian Europe. But, in 1526 Hungary was defeated and for a century and a half was under Moslem domination. This article describes Buda, the capital, (in 1872 combined with a city on the other side of the Danube to form Budapest) during the 145 years it was under Moslem rule. Few monuments of the period remain, but the famous baths and caf6s of Budapest, the author regards as a direct inheritance of the long Islamic occupation of the city. D. Van Der Meulen, "Muslim Problems Connected with an Independent Indonesia" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 292-300, 1947). The fact that Indonesia will be the greatest homogeneous independent Moslem state is seen as creating certain problems. Its masses have charged misfortunes hitherto to their governance at the hands of unbelievers. This comfort will no longer be possible. Also, full freedom will have to be given to Christian propaganda-more complete than before under western rule--if they are to be accepted into the United Nations. New methods of propaganda by Christians will arise. This freedom will result in a more active participation in public affairs by this better- educated minority. It may likewise result in restrict- ing in the name of economy the pilgrimage to Mecca, which a foreign government felt unable to curtail. This will be a serious matter for Islam. W. M. Watt, "New Paths to Islam" (International Review of Missions, Vol. 36, pp. 74-80, January, 1947). Not a research article, but a most interesting illustra- tion of syncretism in the history of religion. On various mission fronts are appearing instances of fellowship between Christians and Moslems at the religious level without attempts at conversion either way. What can be done in this area? It is suggested that in the struggle between secularism and Islamic belief in God, Christians can strengthen the hand of Moslems in their defense of their belief in God. Also, in the attack of modem criticism upon Islamic foundations, Christian- ity can help Moslems to find intellectually satisfying ways of preserving the essential values which are worth preserving, and Christianity is not likely to succeed among Moslems so long as it fails to preserve these. An interesting defense of this view of the author is presented. He insists that in so doing he is in no sense denying the ultimate aim of the Christian mission which he states as "the rebirth of all Muslims by water and the Spirit after confessing Jesus as Lord." Joachim Wach, "Spiritual Teachings in Islam: A Study" (Journal of Religion, vol. 28, pp. 263-280, October, 1948). Reacting strongly against the formal type of study of religions and the choosing out of a sacred literature "nuggets" of truth, without regard to their context, he offers here a study of a Moslem Sufi writer of the eleventh century which he thinks repre- sents "the aspirations of Moderate Sufism, whose function could be characterized as that of a leaven in the dough of the Islamic community." The study is</page><page sequence="4">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 123 of The Unveiling of the Veiled by Al Jujwiri, d. 1087- 1091, translated by R. A. Nicholson (Luzac, London 1936). No brief abstract of the book is possible here, but it will repay the student of Islamic and indeed of Christian mysticism, to consider it carefully. The points of resemblance between Sufi and Christian mysticism are numerous and striking, particularly the common emphasis on love. S. M. Zwemer, "Al Haramain: Mecca and Medina" (Moslem World, Vol. 37, pp. 7-15, 1947). The article, all but the next to the last paragraph of which was written by the author in 1900, is a description of the sacred cities, Mecca and Medina, the principal sacred sites and objects as well as the ceremonies performed by Moslem pilgrims at the various shrines. The new paragraph includes a quotation from a recent traveller across Arabia, and is introduced to show that after nearly half a century there has been little or no change in the inaccessibility of the sacred areas to non-Moslems. IV. PRIMTIvE Francis P. Magoun, Jr., "On Some Survivals of Pagan Belief in Anglo-Saxon England" (Harvard The- ological Review, Vol. 40, pp. 33-46, 1947). The mana concept seems to be clearly referred to in several pas- sages in Old English Charms and heavenly grace in Beowulf is equated by the author with Christianized personal mana. Western LaBarre, "The Aymara Indians of the Lake Titaca Plateau, Bolivia," (The American Anthro- pologist, Vol. 50, No. 1, Part 2, Memoir S 68, pp. 165- 195, 1948). Section 4 of this Memoir on the Aymara Indians is devoted to a discussion of their magic and religion. It treats in some detail of their general god concept, gods and demons, rites and worship, omens and divination, dreams... house magic, and their dances and fiestas etc. It includes an excellent bibli- ography dealing with every phase of Aymara life, in- cluding their religion. The author did extensive field work in the area.</page></plain_text>
