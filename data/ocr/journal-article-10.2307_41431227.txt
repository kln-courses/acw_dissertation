<plain_text><page sequence="1">METRIC ANALYSIS OF A FEMALE FIGURINE FROM TEPE SARAB By Hamed Vahdati Nasab* and Mandan Kazzazi** * Tarbiat Modares University ; Tehran ** Tehran University, Tehran Abstract Prehistoric human figurines in general and female figurines in particular have been of long-standing interest to archaeologists, but there has been considerable debate about their function. Although early human figurines are often viewed as a corpus, there is considerable variety in body proportions, forms and artistic styles across the vast geographical areas and temporal periods for which they are attested. Here, a metric analysis using the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) technique is used to compare a figurine from Tepe Sarab with con- temporaneous and earlier figurines from a broad geographical area. The results of this analysis indicate that there is a clear division in style and body proportions between the female figurines that are made during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods. Moreover, our results indicate that there are clear differences in style and body proportions between figurines found in Central Europe and the Near East. Keywords Tepe Sarab; female figurine; metric analysis; Upper Palaeolithic; Neolithic I. INTRODUCTION Human figurines are amongst the most evocative artefacts that have been discovered at sites dating to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic across the Old World, though they do not typically appear in great num- bers.1 Female human figurines are often referred to as mother-goddesses or Venus figurines, but these names imply a specific function and there is actually little general agreement about the possible function or func- tions of such items. The use of overarching descriptive names suggests that such figurines are parts of a broader tradition and such a view is encapsulated in Leroi-Gourhan's state- ment that: No matter where found . . . they are practically inter- changeable, apart from their proportions. The most complete figurines have the same treatment of the head, the same small arms folded over the breast or pointing towards the belly, the same low breasts drooping like sacks to far below the waist, and the same legs ending in miniscule or non-existent feet.2 The emphasis on some parts of the figurine's body, specifically those responsible for reproduction such as breasts and pelvis, has led some scholars to argue i Beck 2000; Kuijt and Chesson 2005: 123. 2 Leroi-Gourhan's 1968: 96. Iran XLIX 201 1, 1-Ю © 201 1 The British Institute of Persian Studies that they were made essentially without head and hands to emphasise the significance of the exagger- ated elements.3 It is possible that the visual similarities between prehistoric figurines could be related to their function. So far, there have been a range of different explana- tions proposed for their function, including their usage as cult figurines,4 as vehicles of magic in rituals,5 the worshipping of dead ancestors,6 items related to the abundance of food,7 items used to teach proper behav- iour8 and toys for children.9 It is often asserted that female figurines might have been made to be used as symbols of fertility,10 and Marckale11 has suggested that the belief in "Mother Earth" has been seeded in the unconsciousness of the human beings since the 3 E.g.

Kuijt and Chesson12 have suggested that the physical shape of male, female and even of animal figurines embody the social role of males, females and animals in the Neolithic societies. It is possible that the concept of woman as a symbol of fertility and growth developed into the notion of the woman as the goddess of culti- vation, domestication, and any activity related to the growth and reproduction of food on earth during the Neolithic period, and mothers might have been seen as the symbols of life.13 Nonetheless, as Voigt14 and Daems15 have both emphasised, there is unlikely to be one function that can explain all of the possible uses of human figurines across the Old World. Lesure16 has argued that it is important to consider the relevance of resemblance between contexts before presuming similarity of use and/or function. Aside from the potential function or functions of female figurines in prehistoric societies, a range of dif- ferent explanations have been put forward to explain their broad visual similarities. McDermott has sug- gested17 that the particular shape of the female figu- rines resembles a view of a pregnant female when she was observing her body from above. It has also been suggested that the body proportions and specifically the breasts of some figurines (e.g., Willendorf and Laspugue) are indicative of massive hypertrophy of the breasts.18 Gamble19 has proposed that Palaeolithic female figurines can be attributed to three major categories based on their visual features. Group A, which is also known as the classic group, and considered to be the oldest, consists of figurines of different sizes made on different types of raw materials such as lime- stone (Willendorf), serpentine (Savignano), hematite (Petřkovice), mammoth ivory (Kostenki, Brassem- pouy, Lespugue, and Gagarino), and baked clay (Dolní Vestoniče). Most of the specimens in this group are fragmentary, and some are believed to be unfinished (Gagarino). Group В female figurines are relatively 12 Kuijt and Chesson 2005: 155. 13 Marckale 1999; Mellaart 1962; Nelson 2004; Beck 2000; Voigt and Meadow 1983: 188. 14 Voigt 2001: 288-90. 15 Daems 2004. 16 Lesure 2011. 17 McDermott 1996; McCoid and McDermott 1996. 18 Harding 1976. 19 Gamble 1982. small in body size, ranging from 3.7 to 9 cm in length, their heads are not very well modelled, and they are made of stone (e.g., Sireuil, Trasimento, Enval, and Farincourt). Group С is comprised of engraved forms made on different materials and in various sizes (e.g., Laussel and Abri Pataud). The research presented here pursues two main objec- tives. First, one of the female figurines from Tepe Sarab will be examined and compared metrically with some other contemporaneous and earlier female figurines on the basis of their physical dimensions. Secondly, the possibility that there are any meaningful physical differ- ences between the female figurines made in Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods will be investigated. II. GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF TEPE SARAB The mound known as Tepe Sarab is located to the east of the modern city of Kermanshah, in north-west Iran, in the central part of the Zagros Mountains (Fig. 1). Tepe Sarab was first recognised by nearby villagers who conducted illicit excavations, but during the 1960s, as a part of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago's Prehistoric project, Robert Braidwood and his colleagues tested some of the undisturbed por- tions of the mound.20 It was subsequently inspected by researchers from the University of Toronto. The University of Toronto excavations concluded that the site was occupied around 6000 ВС.21 The University of Toronto excavations lead to the discovery of approximately 2400 clay objects.22 Although Tepe Sarab is not the only site where early human figurines have been discovered in Iran (e.g., Ganj Dareh, Ali Kosh, Tepe Guran, Yanik Tepe, Haj i Firuz, Zaghe, etc.), it has the largest quantity of human figurines of all excavated Iranian Neolithic sites. McDonald23 proposed that Tepe Sarab was probably not occupied by family groups, but Broman Morales24 has argued that due to the large variety within the clay figurines corpus, Tepe Sarab was inhabited seasonally by groups of families for some hundreds of years.25 20 Braidwood et al. 1960; Braidwood 1961. 21 Levine 1976; Levine and McDonald 1977. 22 Broman Morales 1990. 23 McDonald 1979. 24 Broman Morales 1990. 25 Broman Morales 1990.</page><page sequence="3">METRIC ANALYSIS OF A FEMALE FIGURINE FROM TEPE SARAB 3 Fig, L Geographical location of Tepe Sarah, » after Broman Morales 1990, III. SARAB FEMALE FIGURINE Of lhe 2400 clay figurines discovered at Tepe Sarah, human clay figurines are the most abundant form. These clay figurines were often well-made, reflecting a great degree of manual dexterity. Seven different categories of human figurines and five types of female figurines26 are recognisable among the Tepe Sarah human figurine corpus.27 However, because of good preservation and the issue of accessibility, only one specimen from the site is used in this study (Fig. 2). This is probably the best known figurine from the site and in this paper it will henceforth be referred to as the Sarah figurine. See also Daems 2004, figs. 5 to 11. 27 Broman Morales ll)90. The Sarah figurine was discovered alongside many other clay figurines, deep in level Sic-2a, close to the west end of the central trench in Operation L28 The Sarah figurine (currently exhibited at the Tehran National Museum) is in a seated posilion and naked. It shows no head and no arms. However, because of the specific form of the neck, it is possible that the original figurine was manufactured with a separate piece as a head, which is missing. The legs are fat and the lower part of the body is dominated by the stomach and the large breasts (Fig. 2), It has no signs of being pregnant. In general, the Sarab figurine's body has a more realis- tic form and less exaggeration when compared to other contemporaneous examples.29 2S Broman Morales 1990. 2t) Broman Morales 1990.</page><page sequence="4">4 HAMED VAHDATI NAS AB AND MANDAN KAZZAZI Fig. 2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Most previous studies of prehistoric female figurines have been non-quantitative in nature, and solely based on the visual aspects of the body features (e.g., large belly, breasts and legs, and the absence or presence of organs). Although such visual comparative analysis provides a great deal of information about the style and form of figurines, the incorporation of more in- depth quantitative approaches is an obvious avenue for future research. Computerised measurements have the potential to facilitate the use of appropriate statis- tical techniques to assess non-quantitative features. For example, while there have been claims concern- ing the similarities and dissimilarities of some of the figurines in their shape and style, it is not exactly clear how strong the resemblance between certain figurines actually is. Some female figurines are visually similar in form (e.g., Avdeevo and Serpantine), but questions about how close those similarities are remain open. There are various methods that might be used to examine similarities, including consideration of manufacturing steps, and reconstruction of elements of the life cycle of the figurines, including patterns of breakage, and also methods focused on morphological characteristics. In order to generate quantitative data for early figurines, a method using body indices and computerised measurements has been adopted here. To ensure that the analysis of the Sarab figurine could be situated in a broad geographical and chrono- logical context, a range of female figurines were selected for analysis from Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites in both Western Asia and Europe. In the original data collecting process, information from 33 female figurines was gathered, but several of those figurines lacked the body parts needed for this study, so a final data set of 22 figurines was selected for this investigation. The figurines that have been ana- lysed are listed in Table 1 and include samples from Western and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and Western Asia. In addition, some of the samples were deliberately selected in the hope that they would act as outliers in the analysis (e.g. the figurines from Upper Palaeolithic Laspugue in France and Neolithic Jomon in Japan). The analysis carried out for this research involved two steps; the first of which was the measurement of different body parts.

In this study, the height of the body is equal to the full length of the statue, from the neck to the most distal part of the body. Width and height of each breast were measured using maximum height and width. Height of chest refers to the distance between the distal part of the neck to the distal portion of the breasts, the stomach height indicates the distance between the distal por- tion of the breasts and the proximal part of the legs. In order to measure the pelvic width, the maximum width was recorded. The second step involved determining body indices. To make comparable indices and to avoid the effect of differences in sizes, the measurement of each body part was divided by the height of the sample (h in Fig. 3) (e.g., height of the left breast/ Fig. 3. Body parts used for making indices, (h: full length of the statute from the neck to the most distal part of the body, a: maximum breast width , b: maximum breast height , c: height of the chest, d: maximum pelvic width, e: stomach height, f: maximum width of leg, and g: maximum height of leg).</page><page sequence="6">6 HAMED VAHD ATI NASAB AND MANDAN KAZZAZI Fig. 4. Phylogenic tree of the female figurines. height of the body, width of the left leg/height of the body, and etc.). After measuring all the indices for the 11 dif- ferent body parts for each specimen, the matrix of morphological distances of each female figurine from the rest of the figurines was calculated using the Root Mean Square Deviation or RMSD tech- nique. Root Mean Square Deviation computes the mean of each specific attribute value, the deviation of each sample from that mean, the square of that deviation, and ultimately calculates the mean of all of the squared deviations for each sample figurine. The RMSD technique makes it possible to compare individual figurines with each of the other figurines in the sample set, and enables the calculation of the degree of similarity between the specimens based on morphology. Table 2 summarises the results of the RMSD analysis in the form of a matrix that compares each of the selected figurines. Based on the results produced by RMSD, a phylogenic tree of the female figurines was created (Fig. 4). V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The phylogenic tree shown in Figure 4 displays the relationships between the 22 figurines as implied by the RMSD analysis, where the figurines are grouped on the basis of the degree of their morphological resemblance. The samples from Laspugue (Upper Palaeolithic) in France and Jomon (Neolithic) in Japan are clear outliers as was predicted. Leaving these aside, three major clusters are observable. Clus- ter one consists of five figurines, Badarian (Egypt), Moldavia (Romania), Bilche Zolotoe (Ukraine), Lena (Greece) and Střelice (Czech Republic). All of these samples date to the Neolithic period, and, except for Badarian which comes from Egypt, are from Eastern Europe. Cluster two is represented by six figurines: Avdeevo (Russia), Serpentine (Italy), Monpazier (France), Vestonicka (Czech Republic), Laussel (France), and Willendorf (Austria). All of these samples belong to the Upper Palaeolithic, and except for Avdeevo, which</page><page sequence="7">METRIC ANALYSIS OF A FEMALE FIGURINE FROM TEPE SARAB 7 TABLE 2. Matrix of RMSD. is geographically distant from the rest of the samples, all are from Central and Western Europe. Cluster three consists of nine figurines: Malta (Malta), Hacilar 5 (Turkey), Pharsala (Greece), Durankulak (Bulgaria), Sarab (Iran), Kostenki (Rus- sia), Kashkuk (Syria), Harvat Minha (Levant), and Vidra (Romania). With the exception of Kostenki, which dates to the Upper Palaeolithic, the remainder of these examples date to the Neolithic, and they appear to come from several geographically distinct regions, including the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is notable that there appear to be degrees of similarity between the three samples from the Mediterranean (Malta, Hacilar 5 and Pharsala), but the remaining samples most resemble others that are not geographically proximate (e.g. Sarab and Durankulak, Kostenki and Kashkuk, and Harvat Minha and Vidra). Female figurines have undoubtedly been a topic of debate for which there has been no consensus. Expla- nations have fluctuated from the universalist to the variable and back,30 and it seems unlikely that a deci- sive explanation will be achieved in the near future, which is undoubtedly complicated by the relative sim- ilarity of many early figurines across vast time periods and geographical regions. While some human techno- logical innovations and cultural adaptations might be seen as being the simplest responses to factors such as environmental pressures (e.g. modifications to flint- knapping strategies in response to the shortage of raw materials, invention of the wheel), the manufacture of female figurines is unlikely to be a simple response to environmental demands. Although objects classified as female figurines might look similar to each other, there are often significant variations in shape, form, style, and materials. In spite of the range of variation, these figurines do display similar body features. By using a RMSD analysis, a selection of female figurines clustered into three groups: • Eastern Europe Neolithic (EEN) (Badarian, Moldavia, Bilche Zolotoe, Lena, Strelice) 30 E.g. Voigt 2001 ; Daems 2004; Lesure 201 1 .</page><page sequence="8">8 HAMED VAHD ATI NASAB AND MANDAN KAZZAZI • European Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) (Avdeevo, Serpentine, Monpazier, Vestonicka, Laussel, Willendorf) • Near Eastern, Mediterranean and Eastern European Neolithic (NEMEN) (Malta, Hacilar 5, Pharsala, Durankulak, Sarab, Kostenki, Kashkuk, Harvat Minha, Vidra). Although some of the samples in the clusters are not strictly related geographically, (e.g., Kostenki from Russia in Group 3), the majority of the samples com- ply with such clustering. In each cluster, there are some interesting pat- terns concerning the within group variations. Group 1 (EEN) displays a significant degree of similarity in the RMSD distances between samples (between 0.40 and 0.42), with the exception of Střelíce. Such close resemblance might be due to the close proximity of the figurines in both geography and time. Such close affinities might also be responsible for the separation of this group from other Neolithic specimens (Group 3). Close resemblance in terms of RMSD distances are also seen in Group 2 (EUP) (between 0.42 and 0.43), although there are two specimens (Laussel and Willen- dorf) that deviate from the rest of the EUP group while still clustering with the rest of the EUP specimens. The Willendorf figurine may actually be an outlier of Group 2. The widest dispersal of RMSD distances is in Group 3. While all of the samples except the one from Kostenki belong to the Neolithic period, their distances are variable (between 0.34 and 0.42). Such a large range might be indicative of the vast geographi- cal dispersal of the samples in this group. In terms of between cluster relationships, Groups 1 (EEN) and 2 (EUP) have lower RMSD distances com- pared to Group 3. It is notable that all of the samples in these two groups come from a broadly similar geo- graphical zone, despite being significantly separated by time. With one exception, the clustering shows a clear separation between the figurines of the Palaeo- lithic and Neolithic, and also provides some evidence for geographical separation as well. VI. CONCLUSIONS As noted above, this research was designed to address two main objectives: first, to investigate whether the Sarab female figurine demonstrates any similarity in form and physical dimensions to other figurines from neighbouring regions; and secondly, to examine whether there are any meaningful similarities or dif- ferences between female figurines made in Palaeo- lithic and Neolithic periods. In terms of the first question, it appears that the Sarab figurine is completely separate from the Upper Palaeolithic group (Group 2) and clusters with Group 3, which dates to the Neolithic. As demonstrated in the phylogenic tree (Fig. 4), this group is the only one that features figurines from Western Asia, and some neighbouring regions to Iran such as Turkey, Levant and Syria, and also examples from the Mediterranean. The rest of the figurines in this group all come from Eastern Europe (e.g. Greece, Bulgaria, and Russia). On the basis of the observed data, there is some possibility that geographical proximities could have been responsible for some similarities in form and physical appearance, and this may hold for the samples in Group 3, i.e. those from Western Asia, the Medi- terranean and Eastern Europe, including the Sarab figurine. There is a considerable amount of literature dealing with the dispersal of Neolithic practices and populations from Western Asia into Europe,31 so there is certainly some possibility that there was a degree of cultural interaction and connectivity between popula- tions in Western Asia and Eastern Europe in the Neo- lithic period. Whether resemblances in figurines are the result of interaction through factors like trading networks or migrations between Neolithic societies remains open for further investigation. Regarding the second question of this research, the results show much less ambiguity. There is a clear sepa- ration between the Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic specimens, and only one instance of overlap (Kostenki). It is perhaps significant that although all the Upper Palaeolithic figurines form a separate cluster (Group 2), they also show a closer proximity to Group 1 (Neo- lithic figurines from Europe) than they do with Group 3, which has some Western Asian samples. This could indicate that, aside from the appearance of a distinctly new style, form and body dimensions in the Neolithic, there might be a degree of continuity between the Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods caused by geographical proximities. More comprehensive conclu- sions related to the two questions posed here will only be possible when larger data sets are analysed. What seems inescapable in all of this is that female figurines dominate the early figurine corpus in most 31 E.g. Sokal et al. 1991; Chikhi et al. 2002.</page><page sequence="9">METRIC ANALYSIS OF A FEMALE FIGURINE FROM TEPE SARAB 9 contexts. Furthermore, most of these early figurines have exaggerated body parts that appear to be related to fertility. At the least, this seems to indicate the impor- tance of the female and fertility, but the significance and social role of that importance still remains enigmatic.
