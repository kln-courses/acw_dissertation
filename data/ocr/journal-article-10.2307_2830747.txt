<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PERSPECTIVES IN ETHOLOGY. Volume 9: Human Un- derstanding and Animal Awareness. Edited by P. P. G. Bateson and Peter H. Klopfer. Plenum Press, New York. $69.50. xv + 314 p.; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-306-43651-5. 1991. In this volume, readers are encouraged to reflect upon the issues of animal cognition, animal wel- fare, the moral status of animals, and the fre- quently debated topic of "rights" and entitlements attributed to animals. Reading all ten chapters in succession requires much patients and diligence, but it is well worth the journey. The contributing authors represent a great variety of areas of exper- tise, therefore, the reader necessarily becomes ac- quainted with the complexity of moral, legal, polit- ical, biological and sociological issues affecting research projects that utilize nonhuman animal subjects. We recommend this book to students and scholars who specifically want to acquaint them- selves with interdisciplinary perspectives directed toward understanding the changing relationship between researchers and their animal subjects. This book is designed to address the interests of those who are concerned about the welfare of their animal subjects. In addition, however, this volume contains numerous contributions dedicated to in- vestigating important hermeneutical questions pertaining to how ethologists interpret and express research data gained from observing animal be- havior. Discussions that explore, in an atypical manner, the relationship between the tendency to give anthropomorphic interpretations of data/behav- ioral events and the corresponding tendency to as- sign cognitive capabilities to the same animal sub- jects (Fisher), are of particular interest. The first three chapters discuss the complex web created by interweaving various views of animal rights and animal cognition. The remainder of the volume considers the central theme of animal awareness. These topics include contemporary in- terpretations of classical ethological studies fo- cused on animal communication (Pepperberg), learning (McConnell), play (Mitchell and Thomp- son), aggression (Lofstrom and Stallings), and bird navigation (Schmidt-Koenig and Ganzhorn). Cartmill's chapter, The Changing Image of the Hunt in Western Thought, summarizes western society's changing attitudes toward hunting, a topic dispassionately analysed in Lessley's excel- lent contribution that focuses upon legal doctrine and the human-animal relationship. The final chapter by Cabrera et al., is a technical review of circular statistics and their usage in navigation and migration studies. This contribution would be beneficial reading for those specializing in orienta- tion studies; however, it is not appropriate for the general audience to whom the rest of the volume is targeted. This book is a valuable contribution to the litera- ture since, in a single volume, the editors have managed to pull together many interdisciplinary themes inherent in the complex topic of animal rights and cognition.
