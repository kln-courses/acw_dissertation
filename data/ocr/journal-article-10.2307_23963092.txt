<plain_text><page sequence="1">God's Action God's Action in the World. By Maurice Wiles. Pp. viii + 118. London: SCM Press, 1986. Paperback Â£5.95. Professor Wiles's Bampton Lectures for 1986 have been published as they were delivered, as eight 'lecture-sermons' without augmentation: a small book though not a slight one. They are more lecture than sermon: a quiet presentation of a particular way of looking at 'the many difficult issues raised by the affirmation of God's action in the world'. His main point is that divine action is primarily 'in relation to the world as a whole rather than to particular occurrences within it' (p. 28). This deistic sort of Christianity is decidedly attractive, especially as presented here with self-critical and tentative courtesy. There is no attempt to shock anyone or to upset fellow scholars who think otherwise. Everything is balanced, patient, and gentle, with no fireworks. Where he differs from traditionalists he does so with a kind</page><page sequence="2">584 REVIEWS of regret at not being able to go all the way with them. The reasons why he cannot go all the way with any theology which affirms God's direct action in the world are always humane reasons, connected with human freedom or the problem of evil. His strongest criticism of a traditional argument is directed at the 'potter and clay' analogy for creation (p. 36). 'Paul', he says, 'is misled by it into a disastrous attempt to stifle the human sense of moral outrage at the apparent injustices in the ordering of the world.' How negative is the upshot? He affirms strongly that the doctrine of creation out of nothing 'is both philosophically and religiously essential' (p. 16), and goes on to argue persuasively that the difference between a more deistic and a more theistic picture is not as great as might be supposed. It is a difference 'between two alternative imageries . . . rather than between two substantially conflicting claims' (p. 36). The 'working model' he prefers is the experimental dramatist who gives the actors their characters and lets them work out the play (pp. 37-8). About providence, both in history and in personal life, he maintains that what is important is 'the kind of world God has created' rather than specific interventions (p. 62). 'The fashion of God's action in the world', he says, is 'making possible the emergence, both individually and corporately, of a genuinely free human recognition and response to what is God's intention in the creation of the world' (p. 103). To this reviewer, two in particular of his arguments stand out as convincing. First, the deistic minimizing of providential interven tions is, at least, a good corrective to insensitive and often moralistic assertions that whatever happens is bound to be the particular will of God. Second, the impressive linking of the doctrine of redemption with the responsibility of God for the risks of creation (p. 49) is an indispensable basis for theodicy. His doctrine of grace is on the very edge of being reductionist. The succour we can hope for seems to be all 'final succour'. The book as a whole is saved from defeatism by certain strong affirmations about the reality and character of God, and (more cautiously) about His ultimate victory. Professor Wiles is not reductionist in being willing to maintain 'that the intention of that creative work will not finally be thwarted' (p. 50). The risk in creation is 'a risk of disasters on the road (a risk that would appear to have been abundantly realized) rather than a risk of ultimate failure' (p. 51). He believes that a fulfilment of 'personal life as we now know it' beyond this present world 'can still be responsibly affirmed' (p. 52). Far from being a faithless view, Professor Wiles's theology makes large demands on faith. It is his grateful awareness of the living God which makes possible his agnosticism about particular manifesta</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 585 tions. The presence of God is ,all-pervasive' (p. 108) rather than to be found in specific events. Prayer is bringing that presence into ,special awareness' (p. 105). The sacraments are ,effective and not merely commemorative symbols' (p. 103). Professor Wiles claims that because ,the search to discern and to realize God's will' is profoundly personal, his approach is by no means depersonalizing, but rather the contrary (p. 105). Yet he admits, or rather insists, that ,God is not a person as we are' (p. 79). Should his view prevail, there would come a time when a greater measure of anthropomorphism would in its turn be a good corrective, to modify this picture of a God who does not do anything in particular, except the one act of creation, for which we are to thank Him. If one finds Professor Wiles's understanding of ,God's action' not specific enough, and yet one still feels the force of the arguments that led him to it, surely the answer must lie in a more positive Christology. Professor Wiles seems to assume that it is incumbent upon him to apply his ,non-interventionist' account of divine activity to God's action in Christ, almost as if it were a test case. He does not want to make Incarnation into an exception: and yet, surely, it is not just permissible but essential that he should do so? Without a crucial act of God which can be identified, the whole Christian faith is liable to Professor Flew's ,death by a thousand qualifications'. The argument that God cannot tinker with His world, without impairing the freedom He designed to give His creatures, stands. But the argument positively demands that we should struggle with the idea that He visited His world. A deistic view of grace and providence is a view which can less afford to sit loose to a high Christology, if it is to be able to give reason for the faith that is in us. If incarnation and resurrection are simply conspicuous examples of grace and providence ^ and then grace and providence are interpreted in a ,non-interventionist' way, then incarnation and resurrection are nothing in particular. But heaven forbid that traditionalists should fall short here of the scholarly humility of Professor Wiles and underestimate the difficulties in their own position (p. 93).
