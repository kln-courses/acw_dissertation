<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS enthusiast who wishes to know the history and background of mohiniydttam, there are other sources containing the same or more complete information. If for the dancer who wants to know what the mohiniyattam form involves as far as movement is concerned, I doubt seriously that this volume will help much. Since only padam and stotra are notated, and no attempt has been made to notate any items of pure or abstract dance, the range and quality of movement are not at all apparent. What does emerge is how closely the mudra follow kathakali mudrd and in what ways they differ, but a comparison of the mudrd would have accomplished this end with more clarity. It is impossible not to compare this book with a project undertaken a few years ago at the University of Hawaii, headed byJudy Van Zile and involving such well-known and accomplished dance analysts as Irmgard Bartenieff, Peggy Hackney, and Carl Wolz. (See Irmgard Bartenieff and others, "The Potential of Movement Analysis as a Research Tool: A Preliminary Analysis," Dance Research Journal 16, no. 1: 3-26.) This project, with a videotape to accompany the notation and publication of the results, provides a thorough analysis of the quality and kind of movement involved in mohiniyattam, concentrating on the earliest and most important item of pure dance (although it also involves passages of abhinaya): the Colkkettu. The rather primitive notation system devised by Venu and Paniker does not hold up very well when compared with the analysis achieved in the University of Hawaii project using Labanotation as well as Effort-Shape and Space-Harmony approaches. It is likely, however, that this little book will stimulate interest in mohiniyttam, a very desirable result. As mentioned earlier, the effort to coordinate in a single publication the material on mudrd from the Hastalaksanadipika and the Bdlardmabharata is commendable. Another useful facet of this book is the pub- lication of the texts (in Malayalam, in transliteration, and in translation) of several padam from the repertoire. BETTY TRUE JONES Ethnic Arts Center Santa Rosa, California THE KATHAKALI COMPLEX: ACTOR, PERFORMANCE AND STRUCTURE by Phillip B. Zarrilli. New Delhi: Abhinav Publications, 1984. xxiv + 406 pp. Rs. 800/00; $160.00 This rather massive study on kathakali technique and performance is the most exhaustive collection of material on the subject of kathakali dance drama so far published. It is clear at the outset that the author has labored diligently and long upon the subject under the guidance of his teacher and principal informant, Kalamandalam M. P. Shankaran Nambudri, to produce this extensive study. The result will be a reference for all who have a serious interest in understanding the complex structure and voluminous content of the art of kathakali. The work is arranged in seven chapters and three appendixes, with a glossary, bibliography, and index. There are more than two hundred and fifty 108</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS photographs and thirty diagrams illustrating kathakali techniques and training as well as making visual the analysis of the structure and organization of the drama and text in performance. Zarrilli speaks of the limited source materials on kathakali available in print in the recent past which could be useful to "the theatre practitioner interested in exploring new sources for experimentation or stimulation (and not intent upon a career in the local South Asian Studies Library)" (p. 6). However, the author clearly respects the necessity of at least a brief career in the South Asian Studies Library. Too few theatre people seem to be so responsible when working with traditional Indian theatre. The early articles referring to kathakali by Barba and Grotowski, cited by the author on page 6, are clearly based upon reactions and opinions drawn from brief and minor contacts and represent no serious study or understanding of kathakali, and still less of the cultural context of the art. Such observations are part of the "mystique" the author takes to task. The interest of such authors as Barba and Grotowski was of course principally in seeking inspiration in Asian theatre forms for their own creative productions. In the United States, most productions of traditional Indian theatre, or creative fusions of "East and West," have been staged as an amalgam of secondhand, or even thirdhand, hastily learned exotic gimmicks to effect an overlay of instant "Indian-ness." Rather than achieving the dynamic abstractions of traditional Indian and experimental Western theatre that with more thorough training could be produced, such productions show too clearly the lack of sustained technical discipline and the lack of determined research, preparation, and attention to detail that make professional theatre. Zarrilli warns the reader of these various "levels" which are other than the traditional art form. His respect for the tradition ofkathakali is evident as the reader progresses. The lavish illustrations, which are the most detailed and extensive so far published on the subject, are unfortunately very poorly printed. Among them are some remarkably fine visual sequences; they are printed in pale gray for the most part, however, and cry out for greater technical responsibility on the part of the printers. It is unfortunate to mar such a serious study. In Chapter 1, the author describes kathakali performances in three dif- ferent contexts: at a Kerala village temple as part of a temple festival; at Venice Beach in California in connection with a festival organized by the Hare Krsna Society of Los Angeles; and at the Trichur Regional Theatre in Kerala, sponsored by the Trichur Kathakali Club. This presentation is remarkably effective, as is his comparison, in Chapter 3, of the training of a kathakali actor and that of an actor in Western theatre. Chapter 7, "The Organization and Dynamism of the Kathakali Experience," is an especially valuable section in which the author manages to elucidate a complex subject in clear, terse language. He not only com- municates the technical realities of kathakali, but much of the vitality of the working art form. His account of the recent history of kathakali, which is a part of this chapter, is very thorough and has obviously been extensively researched. There are minor errors, which are no doubt to be expected in a work of this size and scope. On page 61, for example, we find a statement that "he [Nala] sees a swan, rather than the goose of the original." But of course the hamsa is a gander 109</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS and remains a gander in any version of the Nala story, including the kathakali version, in spite of the fact that Western translators called it a swan, probably because of the swan's greater romantic appeal in Western literature. On page 153, "Sudarsanamurthy" is referred to as "the one who is holding the disc," whereas Sudarsanamurti is rather an anthropomorphic representation of Visnu's cakra (discus). Another example of a minor error is the statement (on pp. 193-194) that the Sari Dance in Nala Caritam is performed in its entirety in first kala and then repeated in second kdla. Actually, this Sari Dance is performed in first and second kdla, but section by section, each carana being punctuated by a kalasam. There are a number of serious difficulties with transliteration. In some cases, Zarrilli evidently disregards his earlier reference to Gundert as the standard for his transliteration and gives without explanation a hybrid Anglo-Indian spelling (for example, "Malayalee" instead of Malayali, pp. 11-12). Some words such as "Mudiettu" (for Mutiyettu, p. 43) have been given a more or less phonetic spelling. Other words consistently have incorrect diacritical marks (Prahlada instead of Prahlada), while others have none at all. Even in the same word, we sometimes find that one diacritical mark is correctly in place while another is missing (such as Hiranyakasipu rather than Hiranyakasipu). These difficulties with transliteration are so numerous that it seems unlikely all of them could be printer's errors. While such flaws are certainly minor, they do detract from the book's usefulness as a work of reference. They are, however, far outweighed by the great mass of information and the technical details of structure which the author has made available to us for examination and further research. The book is unfor- tunately too highly priced for most students and many scholars, both in India at Rs. 800/00 and in the United States at a rather excessive $160.00. A paperback edition would be more to the point. CLIFFORD REIS JONES Ethnic Arts Center Santa Rosa, California 110</page></plain_text>
