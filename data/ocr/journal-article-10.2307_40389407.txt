Pre-Aksumite Art and Identity Building Andrea Manzo Published online: 26 January 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract Several sites dating to the first half of the first millennium bc in Tigray and Eritrea are characterised by the occurrence of South Arabian elements mainly evident in monumental architecture, sculpture and inscriptions. The indisputable presence of such features was at first regarded as proof of a Sabaean colonisation of the region and was also cited to explain the origin of some Semitic languages spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Investigations conducted in the 1960s and 1970s showed that the South Arabian features should be regarded as status-markers of the elite; the contemporaneous presence of elements representing the culture of the indigenous population was also stressed. In this paper, some artworks of this date will be reconsidered. It will be suggested that they are characterised by a conscious use of exogenous elements of different origins (not just Sabaean, not just South Arabian) assembled in a local and original syntax and expressing local social and symbolic messages related to the emphasis of state or group identity. Finally, a new assessment of the art will be attempted following this approach, with a tentative explanation for its rise and development. Résumé Plusieurs sites datant de la première moitié du premier millénaire av. J.-C. au Tigray et en Erythrée sont caractérisés par des éléments sud-arabiques très évidents dans l'architecture monumentale, la sculpture, et dans les inscriptions. Ces éléments ont été considérés comme les preuves tangibles d'une colonisation sabéenne qui pourrait expliquer l'origine des langues sémitiques parlées en Ethiopie et en Erythrée aujourd'hui. Des recherches menées dans les années soixante et soixante-dix ont montré que les éléments sudarabiques démarquaient plutôt le rang et statut social de l'élite, tout en soulignant le caractère local des elements représentant la culture des A.

Keywords Pre-Aksumite • Art • Identity, northern Horn of Africa • South Arabia • Nubia Introduction The meaning of this paper's somewhat cryptic title will become clear in what follows. Capra nubiana is the Linnean term for a variety of ibex, one of the most popular subjects both of South Arabian art (Antonini 1997: 155) and of Pre- Aksumite art on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa as shown, for example, in the fragment of a frieze re-used from the Great Temple at Yeha or in the decoration of the 'throne' discovered at Hawlti, a monument which is further considered below. The South Arabian traits in the art, together with the language and script, are the most impressive elements showing the existence of strong connections between the two sides of the Red Sea at this period (Conti Rossini 1928: 106, 110, 141-143, 219-221; Anfray 1990: 57-58). It was generally accepted that these connections should be attributed to the presence of South Arabians in the highlands of the northern Horn of Africa (see Fig. 1 for map of region) during the mid-first millennium bc, resulting from economic and political Sabaean expansion in the southern Red Sea area (Glaser 1895; Conti Rossini 1928: 99-102; Ricci 1984; see also Anfray 1990: 57). Recently, research at Yeha (Robin and de Maigret 1998: 778-780) has confirmed the hypothesis (for an earlier formulation see Conti Rossini 1928: 102) that the South Arabian elements were not exclusively Sabaean in origin. It was also demonstrated that the links with South Arabia pre-date the construction of the Great Temple at Yeha, which can be fixed around 700 bc, as parts of an earlier structure were re-used in its walls and foundations (Robin and de Maigret 1998: 797). Among these re-used elements, a fragment of a banat 'Ad- di pillar decorated with animal scenes - can be regarded as the most ancient document we can confidently date of Pre-Aksumite art (Antonini 2004: 73-74; Robin and de Maigret 1998: 778, Fig. 51; see Fig. 2). The banat (Ad were architectural decorations of temples and pre-date the Sabaean expansion in the Jawf under Karib'Il Watar and the formation of the Sabaean empire from 750 bc onwards (Antonini 2004: 100-101). Therefore, we can assume that the earlier structure at Yeha was built before the mid-eighth century bc. Features of Pre-Aksumite Art Despite the striking correspondence with types and styles of South Arabian art, stressed by the definition of 'South Arabian art of Ethiopia' used by J.

Archaeological sites Fig. 1 Map of the northern Horn, showing principal sites discussed in this issue (Luisa Sernicola) South Arabian features have been identified in Pre-Aksumite artworks since the beginning of its systematic study. Pirenne herself noted (ibid.: 1046-1047) that Pre- Aksumite - or 'South Arabian Ethiopian', according to her terminology - artworks were often characterised by more accurate and careful execution in comparison with Fig. 2 A re-used fragment of banat 'Ad from the Great Temple at Yeha (from Robin and de Maigret 1998: Fig. 5) £} Springer</page><page sequence="4">294 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 the corresponding South Arabian objects, as is evident, for example, in the case of incense-burner altars, and also in statues like the one from Addi Galamo (ibid.: 1046). This observation, and the fact that most of the royal inscriptions in South Arabian language discovered in the northern Horn of Africa in association with these artworks were paleographically earlier than the inscriptions of the most important Sabaean rulers, led Pirenne in one of her last articles (1989: 262-267) to express the view that South Arabian culture and even language may have arrived in South Arabia via the northern Horn of Africa. She thus reversed the direction of movement traditionally used to explain the occurrence of South Arabian cultural traits on the western side of the Red Sea. The presence of features typical of Pre-Aksumite artworks and distinguishing from South Arabian ones were also stressed by F. Anfray (1990: 58-60). 'Ethiopian' features were also noted by Pirenne (1965: 1047) in small artworks such as the bronze or copper-alloy stamps which Anfray (1990: 25-26) called 'identity marks' (marques d'identité; Fig. 3). These objects can be identified safely now as seals (Manzo 2002: 51-53). The uncertainty about their real use, as expressed by the name they were given, was resolved recently by the discovery in South Arabia of sealings bearing impressions of such objects (Manzo 2002: 51-52; Costa 1991: 41, Fig. 5). It is significant that examples of these seals found in South Arabia are characterised by a geometric shape containing letters or monograms. However, on the western side of the Red Sea, zoomorphic examples are also known. I have suggested (Manzo 2002: 54-55) that this is because identification of the owner required not only the inscription but also the distinctive shape of the object and its impression. This may indicate less developed literacy even among the administrative/elite class on the western side of the Red Sea than on the eastern one. Nevertheless, the choice in the Yeha seals of specific zoomorphic shapes among all Fig. 3 Two copper/bronze seals from Yeha (from Anfray 1990: 27). The specimen on the left is 1 1.0 cm long, that on the right, 8.7 cm £i Springer</page><page sequence="5">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 295 the possible ones cannot be considered casual and meaningless. In one case, the name on the seal was similar to that of a king recorded in the monumental royal inscriptions of a polity flourishing on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa in Pre-Aksumite times (W'RN HYWT) (Bernand et al. 1991-2000, 1: 404). Moreover, some of these seals were recovered at Yeha in tombs that have been ascribed to royal or aristocratic persons (Fattovich 1990). The shape of these seals is characterised not only by the representation of an ibex, a well-known symbol related to South Arabian deities such as Almaqah as well as to royal ritual practices such as the sacred hunt (e.g., Antonini 1997: 155; Beeston 1948), but also of the lion, a subject rare in South Arabia (Vogt 1997: 109), but - as we shall see - widespread on the western side of the Red Sea. Therefore, the choice of the lion for the shape of a seal can be considered as an additional distinctive feature of the 'South Arabian art of Ethiopia'. Actually, these features characterising Pre-Aksumite art and distinguishing it from its South Arabian counterpart which were first demonstrated by Pirenne recall the linguistic features observed in the same years by R. Schneider (1 976) and A. Drewes (1962: 97-99) in the inscriptions from Pre-Aksumite sites of the northern Horn of Africa. In this perspective, the local features noted by Pirenne on the artistic side and by Schneider and Drewes on the linguistic one were considered as traces of one or many local substrata underlying the South Arabian patina. As Fattovich demonstrated (1977, 1980: 83-86, 1982: 79, 1990: 20-22), the presence of original local cultures behind the impressive, but far from dominant South Arabian traits is also confirmed by other aspects of Pre-Aksumite material culture (e.g., the pottery), which are almost totally different from their South Arabian counterparts. These observations marked the abandonment of the hypothesis of a massive South Arabian presence on the highlands of the northern Horn of Africa and of the invasion/colonial interpretative hypothesis, although the presence of small groups or of individual South Arabians should not be excluded (Anfray 1990: 57). In the meantime, Pirenne (1965: 1047, 1967: 129-32) and Fattovich (1977, 1982: 79-81; 1990: 23-24) also emphasised the presence in Pre-Aksumite art of a component related to Egypt. This was demonstrated, for example, by study of the iconography of the sphinx (Pirenne 1965: 1047; Manzo 1994). The South Arabian sphinx is usually winged and explicitly female, clearly related to Near-Eastern and Greek/Aegean iconography, while its Pre-Aksumite counterpart is male and related also in its posture to the Egyptian tradition - most likely derived through the Kushite culture of Nubia (Fig. 4). In Egypt, the sphinx had a solar meaning. I stressed (ibid.: 132-3) that Pre-Aksumite sphinxes are always related to inscriptions mentioning some South Arabian, possibly more precisely Sabaean, deities whose solar connotation has been suggested in recent studies on South Arabian religion. In this case, therefore, we may have a solar zoomorphic symbol from the Nile valley used in the cult of solar deities bearing South Arabian names. But were these really South Arabian deities or South Arabian interpretations of local - possibly solar - ones? For the moment, this question remains unanswered. Not only the occurrence of this specific iconography, but also the popularity of feline subjects - lions, sphinxes - in Pre-Aksumite art suggests some kind of link with cultural traditions of the Nile valley. As already noted, the lion is rarely depicted in the earliest phase of South Arabian art; on the contrary, the lion and â Springer</page><page sequence="6">296 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 Fig. 4 The sphinx of Addi Kerameten (from Anfray 1990: 43), 24 cm high, 33 cm long sphinx occur widely both in the Nile-valley cultures and on Pre-Aksumite sites (Manzo 1994: 120, 127-129, 1999: 127-128). These examples thus suggest that Pre-Aksumite art was not exclusively inspired by South Arabia: Nubian elements, although less impressive, may also be detected. The explanation of these elements' occurrence may lie in a yet-unspecified shared cultural background between the Eritrean-Sudanese lowlands, parts of the Eritrean-Ethiopian highlands and regions of the Nile valley, perhaps also discernible in some shared ceramic traits such as black-topped pottery (Fattovich 1977, 1980: 77-86, 1982: 79-81, 1990: 21-22), and the widespread scraped treatment of ceramics from regional Pre-Aksumite traditions such as that of Guio Makeda (Df Andrea et al. 2008a). Nevertheless, the evidence for contacts between the highlands and the Nile valley in the first millennium bc cannot be dismissed and is supported by Nubian objects in Pre-Aksumite assemblages, such as a Nubian alabaster vessel from the Yeha cemetery and Egyptian/Nubian amulets from Hawlti and Matara (Phillips 1995). The representation of fat women - it is not important here to discuss whether they represent deities or ladies of the elite - in the famous statues from Hawlti (de Contenson 1962, 1963: 42^3, pls. XXXI, XXXIV; Fig. 5) has been regarded as possibly related to the Nile valley and to African traditions more generally (Pirenne 1965: 1047, 1967: 132: Fattovich 1977: 76, 1982: 77, 1990: 23). Their appearance should be considered a manifestation of their social rank and/or a symbol of prosperity; the conventional comparison is with representations of Meroitic queens, but perhaps also the representation of Iti, the wife of the ruler of Punt in the Punt reliefs of the Egyptian queen Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahari, should be recalled here (Conti Rossini 1928: 47, 107; Kendall 1988: 655-656). Nevertheless, the importance of the symbolism related to this subject in the local ideology may be suggested by the occurrence of small sculptures of fat females in Pre-Aksumite and Aksumite Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 297 Fig. 5 One of the female statues from Hawlti (from de de Contenson, 1963b: pl. XXXI), 0.8 m high assemblages at Matara (Anfray 1974: pl. VI, Figs. 1, 2), Hawlti (de Contenson 1963: pl. XXXVII, a, 1-3) and Adulis (Paribeni 1907: 498^99, 563-564, Fig. 27). In any case, it should be noted that the type of the sitting queen/deity like that represented at Hawlti is unknown in the contemporary statuary of Nubia and Egypt, while in South Arabia statues represented private ladies in a similar posture but, in general, with different iconography and style (Antonini 2001: 34-62) . Therefore, we can ask if the Hawlti statues may be a more direct expression of the local culture, rooted in African traditions. In this perspective, it may not be by chance that the majority of South Arabian statues are supposed to be from funerary assemblages and that they also represent male subjects (e.g., Antonini 2001). On the other hand, on the western side of the Red Sea, Pre-Aksumite anthropomorphic sculptures have been discovered only in temples or ceremonial structures and are almost exclusively female. These facts may be related to the prominent role of women in Pre-Aksumite society. This may be supported by the fact that in some Pre-Aksumite royal inscriptions the name of the king is linked with a female name, most likely that of a queen (Bernand et al. 1991-2000, 1: 67), which is unusual in South Arabia (Avanzini 2000: 208). An unprovenanced statue most likely from South Arabia in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Pirenne 1965: 1046) closely resembles our Pre-Aksumite examples from Hawlti in the attitude and rendering of the dress, as well as the general iconography. According to Pirenne, the South Arabian inscription on this Rome statue is paleographically later than one associated with the representation of a fat lady iconographically, stylistically and most likely, chronologically related to the female statues from Hawlti on another artwork, the so-called 'throne', also found at Hawlti. It is also noteworthy that the Rome statue is smaller, of lesser quality and apparently £} Springer</page><page sequence="8">298 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 later in date than the Hawlti ones. Should we consider the statue now in Rome to represent a further case of South Arabian dependence on Pre-Aksumite prototypes, as was proposed by Pirenne (1965: 1046) for some incense-burner altars? For the moment, this question remains unanswered. Nevertheless, a further confirmation of the complexity of cultural processes - not only in the Pre-Aksumite case but possibly also on the eastern side of the Red Sea - is shown by the fact that both the ladies of Hawlti and the South Arabian lady in the Museo Nazionale Romano wear typical Egyptian/Nubian pectoral necklaces (de Contenson 1963: 42; Fattovich 1990: 23; Pirenne 1965: 1046, 1967: 132). The 'throne' of Hawlti (de Contenson 1962: 68-73, Figs. 2-8, 1963: 42-43, pls. XXXII, XXXIII; Fig. 6) is in fact not a throne but a naos or sacred niche designed to house the image of a deity. In general terms, this small stone sanctuary with rounded roof is typologically related to the portable wooden shrines and cabins of the barques of Egyptian and Nubian deities (Fattovich 1990: 24; Pirenne 1967: 129-130) as well as to the Biblical Ark of the Convenant, whose ultimate Egyptian origin (see Kemp 2006: 144-147, Fig. 51) has also been suggested. Nevertheless, components of its decoration - like the frieze of crouching ibexes symmetrically arranged with the 'tree of life' in the middle - are clearly South Arabian in typology, iconography and style (cf. Breton 1997: 137; Müller 1997: 121). Other elements, such as the legs shaped like a bull's, can be ascribed either to the South Arabian tradition (Vogt 1997: 109) or to that of the Nile valley (Bonnet 1997: 104, numbers 105-106). Therefore, in this case we may have a fixed stone monument typologically related to movable Egyptian or Nubian prototypes, bearing South Arabian inscriptions and decorations, associated with representations - the fat lady - possibly of Nile valley affinity or possibly local and, in any case, rooted in northeastern African cultural traditions.

XXXII), 1.4 m high &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="9">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 299 The Hawlti naos is a further confirmation of the complexity of the processes which generated the art we are considering here. Conclusion The evidence discussed so far suggests that, under a unifying South Arabian patina, Pre-Aksumite art is characterised by different elements both exogenous - not only South Arabian but also Nubian - and endogenous. Originality is evident in the treatment of the individual components. In this respect, the accuracy in the production of typically South Arabian objects such as the stone incense-burner altars, already noted by Pirenne (1965: 1046-1047), should be recalled. Originality is also evident in the syntax, i.e., in the way the different components are combined, as in the case of the Hawlti naos, joining Nile valley, South Arabian and local elements, but also in the case of the sphinxes of Nubian/Egyptian type dedicated to South Arabian deities. Thus, to explain the title of this paper, the exogenous elements are like ingredients which are mixed and cooked according to a recipe which is typically local - the syntax - and dressed in a local sauce. This last may perhaps resemble berbere sauce which is served with injera in the most typical dish of present day Ethio-Eritrean cuisine. But while injera is made from teff, a local cereal, berbere sauce is made from chillies, whose origins lay in the Americas... Again, in this case, it is more important to understand how ingredients are put together and processed than it is to determine their ultimate origins. As noted by M. Curtis (2008: 343-344), Pre-Aksumite artworks together with inscriptions and monumental buildings occur in elite/ceremonial contexts, where it is likely that people used to meet periodically. These contexts are traditionally very effective for expressing state ideology, and the target of this transmission may be tentatively identified with members of local elites as well as with the rest of the population. As the inscriptions explicitly show, the activities characterising these sites were performed by the elite of the polity whose name - at least from a certain point onwards- was DfM7(Anfray 1991: 31). It should be emphasised that the artworks and the inscriptions are intimately related (Anfray 1991: 31): often, the artworks bear inscriptions, and, moreover, artworks and inscriptions occur at the same sites which can clearly be considered as having been devoted to ritual/cultic activities. The inscriptions and the artworks, together with monumental structures like the temples whose remains were recorded at Yeha and perhaps at Keskese, form a coherent, uniform and organic 'decorum system', i.e., a set of rules and practices defining what may be represented pictorially, displayed and possibly written down, also including indications about contexts and form (sensu Baines 1990: 20). As has been stressed (Fattovich 1990: 19 and, more recently, Curtis 2008: 342-343), such a system is a defining manifestation of a polity. A relevant element to be taken into consideration here is the uniformity of the Pre-Aksumite decorum system over a large geographic area, perhaps suggesting that it resulted from the implementation of a planned will. In this framework, at a certain point in the first half of the first millennium bc, the artworks and the decorum system that they form with the inscriptions, may have played a crucial role in a fì Springer</page><page sequence="10">300 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:291-303 strategy aimed at the construction and communication of a unitary state identity of D 'MT in a context where different identities were previously present (sensu Jones 1997: 117-118, 127). If and in what way these earlier different political identities may correspond to the locally rooted archaeological cultural traditions characterising the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa at that time (Curtis 2009; Fattovich 2009; Schmidt 2009; D' Andrea et al. 2008a) cannot yet be answered, given the debated, complex and ambiguous relationship between archaeological cultures and group identity (cf. Jones 1997: 129-135). If the artworks themselves were constructed to express and promote the identity of D 'MT9 we may think that their features in terms of subjects, iconographies and even style were not casual, but related to the ambitious programme of the ruling elite. In this perspective, new questions should be addressed in the study of Pre-Aksumite art: • Why were South Arabian and not local or Nubian elements mostly chosen? • Why was each element chosen? • Why were other potentially available elements neglected? Some of these remain unanswered and need further research, while for the first more general one, tentative solutions can be proposed. According to recent and widely accepted interpretations (see again Curtis 2008, 2009, Fattovich 2009), the occurrence of South Arabian elements in what I think was a coherent and consistent decorum system should be regarded as resulting from the adoption of South Arabian traits by a basically local elite, and can be explained by the leading political and economic role played by the kingdom of Saba in the southern Red Sea around the mid-first millennium bc. The choice of the South Arabian component as the dominant one in the construction of Pre-Aksumite art may well be related to the affirmation of the international role of D'MT in the southern Red Sea as suggested by Curtis (2008: 345) and, I add, possibly in the lesser - but not absent - interest of D'MT in the Nile basin. Actually, an interest of the elite of the D'MT in the Nile basin may be suggested not just by the few objects imported from that region discovered in Pre-Aksumite assemblages (see Phillips 1995), but also by the Kushite-Egyptian iconographie elements in the artworks. Nevertheless, if we admit that the aim of the elite was not only to affirm an international status but also to generate a common and acceptable identity for the different local groups who were - willingly or unwillingly - involved in the nation-building operation, we may also hypothesise other reasons behind this choice. For example, the use of foreign elements could be more acceptable for all groups than the use of local ones expressed only by the group which was at that moment promoting the process. Moreover, the South Arabian models not only could be efficient in affirming the international status of the new polity but also they could be accepted by the small groups or individuals of South Arabian origin who were incorporated into its composite reality. Significantly, as noted by Schneider (1973), the variegated composition of the D 'MT polity may also be reflected in the complex and articulated list of titles of its kings recorded in the inscriptions. Was this nation-building operation successful? Perhaps not, given the rarity of inscriptions mentioning D'MT (Phillipson 2009), and, we may add, the few sites where the Pre-Aksumite artworks were recorded. This may suggest that D'MT was a short-lived polity, but only future investigations will add a definitive solution to this Ö Springer</page><page sequence="11">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:29 1-303 30 1 problem. Possibly, this failure was due to problems of involving broad sectors of the population in the building of a state identity promoted by the elite and expressed by the artworks, monumental buildings and inscriptions. Finally, and again related to the complexity characterising Pre-Aksumite art, I would like to stress the occurrence of different components in an original syntax. Here, a provocative question should be addressed: was this complexity exclusive to the elite-state culture because of the historical and political situation it reflects, or did it affect the culture of the rest of the people living on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa at this time? Actually, I think that other aspects of the everyday life were characterised by a similar complexity in terms of origins as well as syntax of their components. For example, the results of recent research have demonstrated that the subsistence economy on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa was largely based on foreign domesticated plants and animals, such as emmer wheat, barley and small ungulates, whose ultimate origin lies in the Near East, together with cattle of Saharan or even, perhaps, Indian origin, and with local crops like teff (Boardman 2000; Cain 2000; D'Andréa et al. 2008b; Schmidt 2009). Thus, should we conclude that all the people living on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa in the first millennium bc were deeply affected by foreign cultural influences and that these influences were not limited to a patina on some expressions of the elite/ceremonial milieu? In this case, even if most of the components may be of foreign origin, I think the ingredients were prepared according to local taste and practice, as happens in present day Ethio-Eritrean cuisine (see e.g., Lyons and D' Andrea 2003; Lyons 2007). Perhaps a trace of this may be detected in the composition of the assemblages collected where food was prepared and consumed in terms of quantity and quality of artefacts. This kind of investigation may also show differences in the processes of food preparation and consumption among the groups living on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa, despite the fact that the staple crops and animals were almost the same in the whole region. Again, this study may throw further light on the regional but related cultures which flourished at that time in the region. This final parallel between artworks and food may seem hazardous and perhaps inappropriate, but actually it is not: food consumption and the ceremonies taking place in the structures where the artworks occur are both activities with high value in promoting group identity. People meet, reaffirm social ties and recognise shared values when they perform actions such as praying and eating together. In food, as in artworks, exogenous elements could easily become expressions and even symbols of local identity and self-representation; I think this is what happened in ancient times on the plateau of the northern Horn of Africa. In this perspective, the identification of the origin of each element in art as well as in cuisine should be regarded just as a first step towards the understanding of how and why it was used, which is researchers' ultimate aim.
