<plain_text><page sequence="1">Q/Imerican SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Volume 3 DECEMBER, 1938 Number 6 THE UNILATERAL ELEMENTS IN MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE L. L. BERNARD Washington University A S CLARK WISSLER has indicated,' there is urgent need to take the data of space-time relationships in the field of archaeology and cul- ture history and give to them a psychological analysis and interpre- tation. This will lift them from the level of earth science and history to social science. Although cultural anthropology claims status as a social science, it continues to do so mainly on the level of archaeology and culture history. I recall the somewhat aggrieved statement of an anthropologist, made some twenty years ago, that anthropology should have occupied the position as human science now held by sociology. He was correct in his general assumption that it had failed to deal with human affairs of con- temporaneous interest but he stated no theory as to its failure to adopt those means of human interpretation, the psycho-social, that are most sig- nificant in the social sciences. In the brief limits of this paper I should like to offer a few suggestions with regard to the methodology of this newer ap- proach. Primitive man, like modern man, we may suppose, observed phenomena and theorized with regard to their meaning. If he came to less acceptable conclusions, it was because his facts were less numerous and less dependable and his logic for handling the facts was less refined and trustworthy. Other- wise, his general method was the same and he had the same objective. He was endeavoring more or less consciously to project some method or system of behavior which would give him a better adjustment to nature and to man. He was striving to live more effectively in his environment. In other words, he was trying to control his world, then as now. This search for a method of control of his adjustment to his world pre- sents, as we see it in analytical retrospect, two major problems. First, the problem of the seat of control or power and, second, the problem of the 1 See E. C. Hayes (Ed.), Recent Developments in the Social Sciences, S-96, New York, I927. 771</page><page sequence="2">772 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW nature of the process of the use of this power for purposes of control. The former problem was solved tentatively by the location of the seat of control in certain Objects with Power. Man was manifestly an object with power. It was a matter of frequent experience that he achieved the objects of his desires but he was not endowed with unlimited power, for sometimes he failed. So often in fact did he fail,-and often in very crucial situations involving life and death, and other matters that were consciously of great moment to him,-that primitive men were not only conscious of their power to make things happen, but they were equally, perhaps even more strongly, conscious of the limitations upon their powers. This strong consciousness of limitations to their powers necessarily resulted in an urgent desire to overcome this inadequacy and ultimately led to the development and em- ployment of magic as a means to that end. Among modern peoples it has led to the development and instrumentalization of science and scientific technology, which are in the process of replacing magic as the means to an adequate control of environment and of an effective adjustment of man to that environment. The power that primitive man attributed in some meas- ure to himself, and of which he sought a larger measure, was not the power of scientific technology, but of magic. Certain other objects, which were not human (although early man did not draw as close distinctions in this respect as we do), were also judged to be objects possessed of this magic power to cause events to happen. These were other animals than men; plants; various inanimate objects, as we call them, although primitive man did not make this distinction; certain na- tural phenomena, like warmth, sunlight, darkness, succession of day and night and of seasons; and many more, all of which were fairly easily per- ceivable. Magic power was attributed to all of these objects on the basis of two assumptions. Either events were perceived to occur in time and space juxtaposition of these objects and things, the post hoc ergo propter hoc or contiguity associative assumption, or there was observed or assumed to be some real or fancied resemblance or other effective association between an assumed causal object with power (human or otherwise) and the object operated upon or manipulated or the effect produced by such operation. This second hypothesis may be termed the analogical assumption. There appears to be good evidence from the data of primitive life and thought that the location or assumption of a magic power capable of pro- ducing desired adjustment behavior antedates in some degree an explana- tion of the nature of that power. The former process, the attribution of power to an object, is much closer to direct sensory experience and simple perception of cause and effect and utilizes in its early stages of development at least, simple perceptions of time and space relationships. Necessary logical inference in the case is slight and the assumed technique of its opera- tion is simple and relatively direct. A completer and more analytical ex-</page><page sequence="3">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 773 planation of the nature of the magical power that causes the desired adjust- ment response, or prevents it, must, however, await the development of at least the simplest mechanisms of introspection and verbal explanation. In other words, there can be no such explanation until there is a sufficient development of language to enable the primitive thinker or philosopher to make verbal comparisons and explanations. When early man began to seek an explanation of the nature of this mys- terious power which he and other objects manifestly possessed in greater or less degree, he apparently arrived at a conception somewhat analogous to our notion of will power. He seems to have come to this interpretation by an elementary process of self-analysis which associated certain subjective or emotional tensions, that collectively we call will, with overt action in self or other objects. By inference, he transferred the observation of this experience in himself to other men and animals, and even to plants and other objects assumed to have power. Either because he saw these objects with imputed power behaving in a manner similar to his own behavior when willing, or because he associated such objects with imputed power in time or space, or by analogy, with overt action and movement in the objects sup- posed to be controlled by them, he inferred that they were also acting under the same sort of emotional stress, which we call desire or aversion, affection or dislike, and which he necessarily attributed to some active and efficient detachable inner power (mana). Thus, early man not only located the source of this power in objects, as a mysterious or magical "mana," but he came in time to develop a crude theory of the nature of this power, or "mana," as analogous to that thing that we have been accustomed to call will. To him this will power, or "mana," was an entity, a detached thing, be- cause in its exercise he experienced sensations, mainly visceral to be sure, but nevertheless sensations; and where there were sensations, he, like our- selves, naturally inferred that there was a causative object or external "thing." Being detached from the object in which it resided, this power was looked upon as a mystical force, as "mana." Later, this thing, or "mana," became a "spirit" to him and it has persisted in a quasi sense as such almost to our own time under the assumption of a guiding spirit which produces results by "act of will." Only now are we learning to analyze this "act of will" naturalistically into emotional conflict tensions and urges that arise in the process of adjustment behavior and to get rid of the con- cept of a detachable power (mana or spirit) which makes things and events happen magically. We must not lose sight of the fact that early man lacked those scientific data which would have enabled him either to explain will, which is much more easily perceived symptomatically than explained scientifically, or to recognize the fact that plants and inanimate objects or other natural phe-</page><page sequence="4">774 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW nomena have no "will" on the human analogy, because they have no sen- soriums and can have no emotional urges. To be sure, early man had made many observations of minor causal relationships operating in a purely naturalistic manner without the assumption of a mysterious driving will power, or mana, and such experiences and observations are the basic ground- work out of which and upon which science ultimately is built. But, in the absence of genuine data of physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and sociology, his observations and experiences could be interpreted, if and when consciously interpreted, only on the basis of his most immediate emotional experiences accompanying choice and action, or as will causation. He and other putative "objects with power" were, he supposed, able to cause things to happen, according to their wishes or wills. This conception of "will," or mana, is of course not the modern psychological concept of will as we hold it, but the primitive notion of will, or mana, conceived as a mysterious, detached power residing in the person, animal, or thing, able to cause the desired result. When early man came, somewhat later, to the conception of a god, this god also possessed this same mystical mana or will power and caused things to happen by acts of will or by fiat. This power was retained even in a pantheistical conception of the supernatural and in the metaphysical conception of Natural Law. This type of assumed causation by will power, or mana, is the essential element in magic.2 The essence of magic is assumed power to produce results by means of wish, will, or fiat, but there is a secondary and accessory principle in magic. This is the principle of form. Both will power, or mana, and its overt expression in action must be kept constant if the willed act is to be effective in securing its intended result. This demand for constancy of form in magic undoubtedly grows out of a feeling of anxiety for the result of the action and the patent observation that a change of desire or of pro- cedure easily produces a modification of consequences. This capacity of a change of form in the willing or the exercise of mana by the worker of magic and in its supplementary instrumentalization, to modify the results of will- ing is easily transferred by inference or observation to changes of form in the behavior of surrounding persons and things, and eventually to all other objects that have time, space, or interest associations with the causal situa- tion. Ultimately this need of stability, this fear of disruptive change in the magic bearing circumstances, may also acquire an ethical significance, requiring all associated persons to conform strictly to an elaborated system of magic as a strict personal or social obligation. Some very queer results may come from this extension of the magical significance of form to em- brace all related circumstances, such as the necessity of the African king 2 See L. L. Bernard, "Psycho-Sociological Interpretation of Magic," Publ. Amer. Social. SOC., 22:60-7I, (I928).</page><page sequence="5">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 775 mentioned by Frazer3 to sleep sitting up in his chair in order to keep the winds blowing; of the Japanese emperor to sit immovable on his throne with his crown in place in order to insure the stability of the empire; of the compulsory meticulous observance of all forms of the ritual, of prayer, of dress in current orthodox magical religious ceremonials; and other like magical requirements in primitive and modern religious and secular life sufficiently numerous to fill an encyclopaedia. It is not intended here to go into a detailed analysis of the psychology of magic. Something of this sort has been done elsewhere.4 It is merely desired to make clear these two major personality elements that inhere in magic. One of them, detached will power, or mana, goes back to the earliest forms of magic, and the other, form, which grows into ritual, is also very primitive, although apparently of somewhat later date of origin and development. The aspect of form in magic grows into great importance as ritual, which, in the character of systems of magic, develops into religious controls of a supernaturalistic character. Thus, ritual, the embodiment of ceremonial form, comes to be as important as will power, perhaps even more important, as magic becomes systematized, for form is the essence of systematization. It is, however, sufficient here to note the fact that both of these aspects of magic, will power, or mana, and form, or ritual, are personality attributes. The purpose of this paper is to trace in skeleton form the unilateral per- sistence of both of these personality forms throughout the development of supernaturalistic controls. In fact, they antedate anthropomorphic super- naturalism, and they persist after anthropomorphic supernaturalism tends to decline into relative insignificance and neglect in the theory of social control. First, then, in tracing the unilateral development of personality elements in relation to the supernatural in magic, let us examine briefly the succes- sive types of objects in which this magic power is lodged. If we omit the general object, nature, which is said by some anthropologists and observers of primitive religion to be feared by primitives, we are able to distinguish seven of these types of objects, as follows: fetishes, totems, spirits, heroes, gods, metaphysical principles or essences (finally summated by the meta- physical philosophers as Natural Law), and the social collectivity. Each of these will be considered briefly in its turn. The point to be emphasized is that each of these types of objects endowed with magical power is regarded at the time of its dominance as a control medium or device, as a carrier or embodiment of mana or will power, by means of which it exercises direction over events on the analogy of putative human willing. There is here a com- plete unilaterality of development, as far as the mystical power is con- cerned, although the imputed magic will power inherent in the control 3 The Golden Bough: The Magic Art. 4 See L. L. Bernard, op. cit.</page><page sequence="6">776 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW mechanism necessarily expresses itself with some degree of variation ac- cording to the nature of the concepts of psychical causation that are domi- nant at the time concerned. Obviously the fetish and the totem are not to be distinguished primarily by the nature of the objects that serve as the one or the other, but mainly by the person or persons each serves in the practice of magic, and second- arily by the form in which the act of will or the manifestation of power exerts itself in the one or in the other. This latter distinction is in many cases so slight as to be almost negligible. Both fetish and the totem are not only objects with power but they are also interchangeably instruments of power as exercised by another object or person, that is, means whereby the human or animal magician may achieve his own ends through magic. The fetish may perhaps more frequently serve this instrumental function than does the totem, although the totem also very often functions as an instru- ment of some worker of magic. Both fetish and totem, moreover, have in themselves such mana or power of will, on the analogy of the human will, that they are capable of producing good or evil effects on their own account. Perhaps, here again, the fetish is ordinarily the more passive of the two objects with power. Like the earliest men, the fetishes are not likely to be particularly active in producing their magic results. They are reservoirs of magic energy or of mana to be exploited by the worker of magic or medi- cine man, rather than actively concerned in working magic for themselves. As early man lacks full self-consciousness regarding his powers and is ac- customed usually to take things as they come to him, so the fetish fre- quently lacks the initiative which is often possessed by the totem. The analogy between early man and the fetish in this respect is clearly observ- able, and may be attributed to the fact that the putative power of the fetish to work magic or exercise control over events and things is merely a projection of the primitive man's consciousness of his own real or supposed powers by analogy or association into the fetish itself. Since both the supernaturalistic concepts, fetish and totem, are, as con- ceived by primitive man, human creations or conceptual generalizations rather than objective facts, they may be properly regarded as having sig- nificance only in relation to man's theory of control of adjustment through magic or the direct exercise of will. Early man sought to establish a rela- tionship with fetish and totem in order to secure ends thereby that seemed to him to be possible and desirable. These objects with power were con- ceived by him to be able to secure for him an adjustment which he valued. In return, he was willing to render the service, in the form of respect, flattery, ceremonial performance, or material aid, that he believed neces- sary and within the limits of the value of the favor conferred upon him, in order to secure the end desired. Since the fetish is generally of prior origin to the totem, it may be assumed to have less personality, but this is not</page><page sequence="7">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 777 necessarily and uniformly the case. While most fetishes are inanimate things rather than living objects, more recent forms of the fetish, especially the mascot and the spirit,' may have more personality than the older forms of the totem. In fact, any object whatever that can be regarded as possessed of will or personality power and is capable of magical manipulation in the service of man may be regarded as either a fetish or a totem by the primi- tive. Many modern persons who believe in magic also recognize or apply this psychological principle, but with a change of names. The amulet or charm are used in this same manner. Even the "watch charm," which now is regarded merely as an ornament, still usually retains the form of a fe- tishistic object or scroll or monogram or other symbolic mystery which once was firmly believed to have magical power or mana. Dogs and cats, and other animal pets, or even plants, and human well wishers, are often regarded as possessing a mystical power to bring their possessors good luck, thus continuing the character of the fetish or totem under other names. It was said above that the distinction between fetish and totem is not to be found primarily in the objects themselves functioning as such, but chiefly in the person or persons with whom they are associated. The essential defi- nition of a fetish is that it is an object of any character whatever that sustains a special magical service relation (frequently more or less passive and manipulated) to some human individual. It may be a curious stone, a bear's claw, a bone taken from a hunted animal or from a human being, a sacred mountain, a heavenly body, an animal or a plant. The essential point is that it must have mystical or personality power or mana, that is, detached will power, which is made available to some human being who has a special magical relationship to it. Although fetishes were most character- istically associated with early primitive men, they still survive in such forms as President Woodrow Wilson's "buckeye" which he carried around with him, the Negro's rabbit foot, the amulet of the superstitious, or the stock- market gambler's favorite pencil. Naturally, the fetish must be something with which the individual may establish a special magical relationship, whose manaa," or "will power," he may control. On the other hand, the totem is any object, material or immaterial, that is possessed of this magical manaa," or "will power," which has been en- listed in the service of the group, the clan or tribe, as a whole. Some of the objects that have been listed as totemic objects by those familiar with the manners and customs of primitive peoples are natural inanimate objects, such as stones of peculiar shapes or colors or location; prominent objects in the landscape or in the heavens, such as the moon and the sun; occasional 5 This shade or other self of the fetish or totem is clearly a projection by analogy upon these objects with power of the notion of primitive man that he himself is possessed of a shade, or spirit, or soul. Thus, personality in the fetish or totem develops pari pass and as a result of the idea of personality in the subject.</page><page sequence="8">778 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW man-made objects, such as a metal cooking pot, which was a matter of particular pride and value; a great variety of useful plants, including fruits, vegetables, and grass; edible or otherwise important animals, such as the grasshopper, locust, dugong, turtle, fish, chameleon, snake, python, birds, and fowls, crow, hawk, turkey, eagle, bear, fox, wolf, lion, tiger, sheep, ox, and even fabulous animals and spirits. Here we find the totem entering into the realm of imaginary objects and even of abstractions, such as the sunshine or the moonlight, aspects of the seasons, and also mental and moral qualities. I have listed these illustrations of the totem in an ascend- ing order of their evident possession of will power, or mana, on the one hand and of their abstractness of conception on the other hand, because I believe this is approximately the order in which they developed. Only the earlier peoples accepted the less animate and simpler material objects as totems, worshipping such objects as stones, caves, mountains, rivers, and the moon and the sun. But examples of the worship of abstractions and of spirits and mythical personalities comes down much later, even into our own time. Just as primitive peoples ate their totems ceremonially, or found other means of ceremonial identification with them, in order to achieve a closer magical relationship with them, even barbarian and more or less civilized peoples have been known to eat their gods, the lineal descendants of the totem, in fairly recent times. Other more abstract or "spiritual" means of identifi- cation with abstract totemic objects are even more common as modern survivals. It is not possible to enter here into an account of the origin of the con- ception of, or belief in, spirits. It is familiar to all anthropologists. Suffice it to say that a belief in spirits could not have arisen until the primitive conception of the primal personality element of will power, or mana, had expanded through experience and self-analysis into a more general notion of personality as a whole. The rudimentary concept of will power and of objects with power of will, as described above, or of mana, undoubtedly appeared long before the complex idea of an integral human personality was evident on the intellectual horizon of primitive man. The fetish and the totem were products of this earlier rudimentary concept of will-in-things or mana, just as spirits and heroes and gods were the products of the de- veloping theory of personality in a wider and completer sense. It was of course not possible for earliest man to picture himself as an integrated personality in the modern sense of the term. It may have been many hun- dreds of thousands of years after he crossed the hypothetical line between the nonhuman animals and man before he even arrived at the crude early notion of will power or mana and objects with power that has been de- scribed above. The nearest approach to such a recognition that we see among animals is that they are conditioned to fear some types of animals and to approach and even to show a low type of affection for others.</page><page sequence="9">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 779 It must have required many millenia for early man, already possessed of the notion of will power, or mana, in objects, to analyze the behavior of self and of others, with the help of expanding language concepts, until he could perceive the profiles of personality to such an extent that he could conceive of spirits. The early spirits, we know from the study of the most primitive peoples, were like the people themselves, very limited in char- acter and wholly wanting in general idealism. Like the totems and the fetishes, they helped their allies and harmed their enemies. Also, they performed these functions more subtly and efficiently and less mechanically, because they had more personality. That is, the primitive emotions of fear and anger and the lusts were being supplemented by more subtle and be- nevolent emotions and by brighter gleams of intelligence. As the personalities of man and spirits expanded, they did their work of magic ever better than before. These spirits were only abstracted and stepped-up totems. They were, in fact, at first merely the shades or other selves of the totems.6 Many of them were plant and animal spirits and some of them were spirits of places, of stones, of mountains, of heavenly bodies and the like. Such a mythology as that of Greece and Rome offers us almost innumerable examples of this spiritualizing of the old material fetishes and totems into invisible personalities. Even such a writer as Toy, who combats the idea of the transmutation of totems into spirits and gods,7 nevertheless presents a succession of data which goes far to disprove his own theory and to sub- stantiate the one set forth here.8 Budge has illustrated the same trend in his study of the Egyptian religion.9 The evidence on this point seems to the unprejudiced student to be overwhelming. The appearance of heroes dates both before and after that of spirits. There could be no heroes without an understanding of the major aspects of personality; but with the coming of such an understanding, the totem tends to merge into the hero. The hero represents, in fact, a projective idealization of the benevolent will traits which were already beginning to be realized in the spirits. He is a glorified friend or ally of the tribe, such as the friendly totem could be only as it merged into the hero with his more highly developed personality traits. He is the personification of all or much that the community would like to be or do for itself, reduced to human form and, perhaps usually, but not necessarily, attached to some actual living or deceased personality. As a myth, the hero lives in the ideals of the people 6 The Homeric account of the dead contained in the eleventh book of the Odyssey is in perfect harmony with this interpretation of the primitive man's conception of ghosts or spirits as passive and incompletely evolved personalities which could be manipulated, like fetishes, by magic workers. The same truth is illustrated by the character of the ghost or spirit of Samuel called up by the Witch of Endor at the request of Saul. See also V. D. Mac- chioro, From Orpheus to Paul, 35, I 55.

Wallis Budge, From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt, Oxford, I934.</page><page sequence="10">780 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW and usually has a human mundane base or stem. Thus, it is the hero that slays the totem, or shall we say, devours him; for the totem is swallowed up by the hero by virtue of the richer personality and the greater benevo- lence of the latter. It is not that totems do not persist after the coming of heroes, for they do; and to some extent they become rivals of the heroes, for the totems also acquire personalities. They become transformable into men and they have the souls of men in their animal or plant bodies. Even the sacred mountain or the sacred rock or river acquires anthropomorphic spirits. Formerly, mere animals or plants or stones might have more will or magical power, more mana, than men, and such nonhuman objects might be superhuman, although not necessarily supernatural. But when personality grew to be much more than bare will power, or mana, and the concept of spirits arose, the superhuman was merged with the supernatural, or the spirits, and later with the gods. Thus, the fetishes and totems gradu- ally ceased to be superhuman. They did not disappear, but they either took a very subordinate place, like our modern amulets and mascots, or they borrowed importance from men and the spirits by acquiring their forms. Hence, occurs the evolution of magical fetishistic and totemic objects into spirits, usually and increasingly possessed of human forms. When the human hero first appeared as an exceptional hunter, warrior, artificer, or magician, he still remained human; but with the coming of spirits, it was but a step to transform him into the supernatural and to make him, like the spirits, also superhuman. Thus the hero became a super- spirit, for he was the personification of extraordinary spiritual powers, with an extra allowance of both magical powers and good will. He was a spirit, because only the dead ordinarily could become exalted as heroes of this supernatural type. Not otherwise could sufficient illusions about them easily be created. This exaltation was accomplished in two ways, perhaps in three. At his death, the ghost or spirit of the hero survived and remained a local power or ghost to conjure with long after. In other cases, tradition or folk embel- lishment raised great heroes of the past into demigods and gods. Thus, Perseus and Hercules, and the ethical heroes of the later reformistic re- ligions, such as the Prophets, Dionysius, Buddha, Jesus, Paul, came into existence. In a third type of cases, a powerful political or sacerdotal per- sonage might be ritualized into divinity even in his own life time. As in the case of the Pharaohs, for example, his elevation to high office deprived him of ordinary human personality and made of him the chief functioning spir- itual personality which personified and represented the sacred institution, which persisted more or less as a folk illusion, and also the hopes and wishes of the people. In large measure, the higher priesthood was subject to this same sort of metamorphosis of the human into the divine by virtue of the ritual that divorced them from ordinary life and gave them to the institu-</page><page sequence="11">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 78I tional fellowship of the gods. This last transformation of the hero could occur only in the age of the gods. The essential thing to note here is that the personality of the hero, either as a human being or as a spirit, or later as a god, is not of a different order from that of the fetish, the totem, and the spirit, but is merely a type of magic working person with power who has grown in status and definition with the corresponding growth in power of personality analysis of his type. The saint is, of course, the hero with the highest modern development of personality in the direction of supernatural, as well as superhuman, magic working power of will, or mana. The saint is merely the theological version of the popular folk hero. The gods first come onto the stage as spirits with even more highly de- veloped personalities. Their power of will, or mana, has been still further refined and increased, especially in the direction of the benevolent emotions and intellectual analysis. In the polytheistic stage, it has also been special- ized and departmentalized, as well as increased in power and effectiveness. It is not a different sort of personality or power, but is more highly de- veloped and richer in its attributes. Even with the approach to mono- theism, through henotheism, we see merely a perfecting of personality rather than a change in kind. How marvelously personality has grown from the scant anthropomorphic attribute embodied in mana, on the analogy of the human will, that characterized the fetish, in its long development towards the richness of an idealized, projected personality of the mono- theistic deity! But magic is still the form of the power that is used at both of these extremes of supernaturalistic personality. The gods, like the fetish or the totem, disdain to employ the principles of physics or of chemistry, or of any other science, to achieve their ends. They use will or fiat, the royal instrument of the gods. Did not the gods say let there be this and that item of creation? And behold! there is was. With the coming of the gods, or rather of the greater gods, the great supreme gods, the unilateral development of personality ends. We have reached the last stage through which personality passes under the aegis of control through magic. There now begins a transformation in the theory of personality, in which it ceases to be explained in terms of magic will and is reintegrated on the basis of science. Will is no longer regarded as an iso- lated, detached, causal entity, but becomes a functioning organization of behavior, built up through the conditioning of responses. The telling of the steps taken in this transition from magical postulates to a scientific explanation of will theory is another story and cannot be undertaken in detail here, but it may be said that the transition was made, not in primi- tive, but in historic times, through a gradual replacement of theology, first by metaphysics, and later by science. The personality attributes of the gods were broken down into metaphysical essences and principles. Meta- physical pantheism replaced theology; then Natural Law supplanted</page><page sequence="12">782 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW revelation; finally, experimental methods of science were substituted for the metaphysical postulates of Natural Law. Science ultimately produced social science; and collective will or action, guided by the social sciences, assumed charge of the adjustment behavior of mankind. At least, social science offers its services in this connection. In all of this grand process, the evolution of the control over behavior so scantily summarized here, in which magic is finally replaced, or is to be replaced, by science, we find a fourfold evolution. i. A magical concept of will power, or mana, appears to facilitate and standardize the theory of the control of adjustment. 2. The concept of fiatistic will is expanded and instrumentalized by a developing analysis or understanding of personality. 3. Personality analysis develops from the emotional into the intellectual and produces a logic which reduces human behavior to metaphysical prin- ciples or essences. 4. Metaphysics gives way to science and the logic of magic and of metaphysics falls before the logic of science. Personality does not disappear with the discrediting of magic, but becomes rational with the development of a science of social psychology, by means of which supposed magical will-causation is explained in terms of the conditioning of responses. If we turn now specifically to the element of form in the personality sequence on a magical plane, we find that successive developments fall into three fairly distinguishable planes or levels of magical performance. These are the overt behavior level, the literary or symbolic language level, and the integrated logical or philosophical level. We shall take up each of these levels briefly in turn, recognizing that there is a rough correspondence between the personality type, based on the detached will power, or mana, system of causation, and the form of the magic performance. Thus, the overt behavior forms of magic performance seem to have their greatest initiation during the predominance of fetishistic and totemic magic but continue on through the development of succeeding forms of magical performance. Roughly speaking, the literary or symbolic language forms of magic performance are associated at their maximum development with the preponderance of willed control through heroes, spirits and gods, al- though the beginning is earlier and the persistence is later. The integrated logical or philosophic level begins in earnest with the gods and reaches its height during the period of eclipse of personality under the metaphysical and scientific systems of adjustment control, as expressed in terms of pan- theism, the postulates of Natural Law, and scientific sequence and coinci- dence or correlation of phenomena. That is to say, the overt behavior and the literary or symbolic language forms of magic are both closely cor- related with personality, although the literary and language forms of magic are associated with higher forms of personality than are the overt behavior forms. The integrated logical forms begin in the period of the highest personality development but they also survive personality, just as they also survive magic itself as a means of control of adjustments.</page><page sequence="13">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 783 The overt behavior forms of magical control by means of mana, or detached will power, fall into the two classes of contact and imitative magic. Mana is transmitted by touch, which may take on the form of force. Force- ful manipulation, such as a blow or a kick, or a shove, may convey will as well as momentum. Sometimes primitive peoples beat their fetishes, their totems, leaders, or even the images and living incarnations of their gods, in order strongly to impress upon them, or the spirits which they represent, their own willed attitudes or desires, much in the same way that they beat their domestic animals, their slaves, or their women for the same purpose. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the use of such physical violence for purposes of control of the behavior of other people and things is not regarded as merely an exercise of physical force, in the scientific sense of that term, but rather as a special and more violent than usual application of will power, or mana, motivation. In the minds of the per- petrators, it constitutes magical rather than mechanical method, but this process of conveying will power, or mana, by means of force is perhaps ex- ceptional rather than the general rule. The usual method of this type is by light touch, such as the laying on of hands, touching the body or the raiment; or it may even be limited to pointing at the person or object that is to be influenced. Many magic-ridden primitives object very strenuously to having strangers or enemies point at them, or even talk about them in their absence, or when they cannot hear. This aversion to being talked about still persists in fact and in its modern form it is by no means always purely a rational dislike but is frequently based on an assumption of magic. The expression, "My ears burn; somebody is talking about me," illustrates this superstitious belief in magic. The magic of similarity is more advanced and correspondingly more complicated. In its higher forms of verbal mimicry, it runs over into the literary forms of magical control. In its simplest manifestation, it consists of pantomime, in which the object whose virtue the magician wishes to possess or whose conduct he desires to influence is imitated in body move- ments. Instead of pantomime, drawing, painting, or sculpturing (making of an effigy) the object may be resorted to, supposedly with equal, or almost equally valuable, results. All of these processes may involve total mimicry, or they may be only partial in their imitativeness. Gesture is the most typical form of partial mimicry. The trait or behavior desired is indicated rather than completely described in gesture magic. Verbal magic is almost always partially imitative and largely indicative, but whatever form of overt behavior magic is used, the purpose is always the same,-to convey or to receive mana, or will power, from one object to another. The literary or symbolic language forms of magic control are not entirely separate from the preceding forms. They are simply more complicated and more highly organized or integrated verbal expressions of the same atti- tudes. They develop out of the lower forms of overt magical practice,</page><page sequence="14">784 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW largely through gesture language. Their distinctive characteristics are that they have complex, describable meanings. That is, they consist of spells, blessings, curses, and prayers or petitions for the reception of good mana, or good will, or for the avoidance of bad mana, or evil will. Spells may be laid wholly through overt contact, but more easily and effectively through overt imitative procedures or gestures, and more easily still by means of a mixture of descriptive and emotional verbal language. In either case, if they are to be distinguished from mere overt behavior magical perform- ances of the contact or imitative types, the spells must be accompanied by or consist of some sort of gestural, pantomimic, or verbal meaning expres- sion. In their highest forms, however, they are clearly verbal, and consist primarily of benedictions, curses, and petitions, as stated above. The literary or language form of magical performance has two distinctive advantages over the other forms. Their linguistic expression renders the process more easily definable and, as a result, more effectively communica- ble or transmissible. Thus, the conditioning of the requisite responses in the subject is greatly facilitated. Both of these advantages apply alike to the person or object to be influenced and to the one who wishes to acquire the magic art or magic control over another person or thing. In order that the form of the magic may be effective in its influence upon its object, it seems to be necessary both to define it and to communicate it to the object. Thus is the subject conditioned properly to respond to the suggestion which is the essential element in literary or verbal magic. The integrated logical or philosophic forms of magic grow out of and over- lap the preceding forms, at least in the more primitive developments of this higher type of magic performance. This fact is, of course, one of the evidences of the continuity or unilateralness of the development of form in magic control. There are no mutations from one form or level of magical performance to another but merely growth in complexity and in organiza- tion. The ritual, which is the lowest integrated logical form of magic, is not even philosophical, although in the course of time every ritual tends to develop a philosophical explanation or tradition. It is at first almost com- pletely overt, harking back to the overt behavior patterns of magical control through detached will power, or mana, when literary forms of magic were as yet very inadequately developed; but in time ritual adds verbal processes to pantomime, to partial mimicry, and to gesture; and ultimately it is swallowed up in the next succeeding stages of magic forms. These of course are mythologies and theologies. There is no essential difference between mythologies and theologies, except that a mythology is a dead or outmoded theology which has become largely esthetic, or a means to intel- lectual amusement, instead of a settled conviction and an obligation to magical performance. By virtue of this fact of relative power of survival, we may safely assume that the mythology, while it still remains in its</page><page sequence="15">MAGIC THEORY AND PERFORMANCE 785 original theological pattern, is more crude in form and expression and less abstractly verbalized, and in fact less verbalized altogether. In its later nontheological development, when it has lost its serious and sacred char- acter, mythology becomes a subject for art in a sense that would be im- possible for an active theology. As such, the imagination is brought to play upon it in a variety of ways which result in its fanciful and loquacious elaboration that may render it highly literary and artistic on the lighter and more fanciful side. Both mythology and theology, however, deal pri- marily with personalities, natural and supernatural, and are highly inte- grated systems developed originally for the purpose of facilitating magic control through the transmission of detached will power, or mana. When the personal will aspect of this magic control begins to drop out, the mythologies and theologies also have begun to decay. Personality and theology are as inextricably bound up as are magic and will power, or mana. In fact, the two systems parallel and supplement each other. One is not pos- sible without the other. As we have already pointed out, metaphysical categories of essences and logical principles, embodied ultimately and systematized in the form of Natural Law, replace supernaturalistic per- sonalities in accounting for human behavior and human destiny. At the same time, the magic of a detached personal will power, or mana, is re- placed by the magic of a pantheistic or universal and impersonal will. The process of analyzing this universal or metaphysical logic into its concrete specific processes leads to science, just as the process of instru- mentalizing its magic by means of mechanical and psychological processes develops practical and nonmystical technologies of mechanical and sym- bolic controls. Thus, a scientific theory and a scientific technology emerge together from the metaphysical logic that replaced theology. This scientific theory and this practical common sense technology expand ultimately to include a social science and a social technology, which in turn give rise to a theory and a technology of social control that are analogous to the physical sciences and technologies and which, like these, dispense with the magic of will power, or mana. Thus, finally, man learns to consummate his adjustments to environment more effectively without either the use of magic or the employment of objects with detached will power, or mana. The magic is replaced by naturalistic mechanical, psychic (symbolic), and social processes, and the assumed use of will power, or mana, as a means to compelling desired results through supernaturalistic agents gives way to scientific analysis of the conditioning factors involved and to their construc- tive utilization for the production of desired ends. Here, therefore, we have come to the limit of the second part of our theme, which was to trace the unilateral elements in the personality sequence of early supernaturalism, both as to will and as to form. The analysis has been brief and highly com- pressed, but it is hoped that in outline, at least, it has been not unclear.</page></plain_text>
