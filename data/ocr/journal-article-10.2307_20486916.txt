<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS THE NEW ENCYCLOPEDIA OF UNBELIEF. Edited by Tom Flynn. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2007. xii + 897 pp. $199.00 cloth. This successor to the 1985 Encyclopedia of Un belief, which was conceived and edited by the late historian of atheism Gordon Stein, arrives on the scene at a most propitious moment. In a country that has confounded scholars of religion with its widespread resurgence of conservative piety, there has been a spate of books-some individually au thored, others edited-by apostates eager to explain why they left their respective conservative folds (e.g., Babinski 1995; Hirsi Ali 2007). More conspicuous is the recent wave of books on atheism (Dawkins 2006; Dennett 2006; Harris 2004, 2006; Hitchens 2007a, 2007b), which has surprised observers by spilling over onto The New York Times bestseller lists, where it retains a presence to this day. Who are the readers who have vaulted these titles into such prominence, especially in a pop ulace that says it is far more willing to elect a gay person as president than an atheist? Accord ing to recent national surveys, as many as 9 percent of Americans-some 20 million people-identify themselves as agnostics or atheists, a proportion that is slowly but steadily growing. But so also is the num ber of books-Marshall (2007) is one of the better ones-vigorously critiquing "the new atheists," sug gesting that it is not just the large-if-seldom-heard choir that is buying and reading these works. In the midst of this ferment comes the New En cyclopedia of Unbelief. In the introduction, editor Tom Flynn identifies three reasons that this new edi tion was thought to be necessary. First, much had changed in the period of two decades since the first version was published, both in terms of religious and secular movements and in regard to their broader contexts, including the collapse of the Soviet Union and, of course, 9/11. Second, the role of religion in society had shifted noticeably worldwide, and where the Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu traditions were expanding, a disturbing trend became evident: it was the theologically literal as well as socially and doctrinally conservative viewpoints that were grow ing most rapidly, often at the expense of more the ologically moderate and scientifically sophisticated perspectives. Third, Flynn and his Editorial Advi sory Board-which, in addition to Dawkins (who wrote the Foreword) and Dennett, includes Patricia Churchland, Anthony Flew, Adolf Gruinbaum, Van Harvey, Michael Martin, Kai Nielsen, Steven Pinker, Peter Singer, J. J. C. Smart, Lionel Tiger, Ibn Warraq, and Edward 0. Wilson, among many other, similarly distinguished scholars-saw various ways that they wanted to approach the project differently, including reducing the prominence of survey articles, increas ing the number of biographical entries, and placing unbelief, especially 19th-century freethought, into the larger context of related reform movements. The result is a noticeably larger work than Stein's, one that is properly called a successor rather than a revised edition, for even though most of the original topics remain, virtually all have been reconceived and rewritten by new authors. Moreover, many essays on new topics have been added, a good number of substantial length. Of the some 500 entries, the largest number consists of biographies, most of them of persons known chiefly for their contributions as reformers: secular ists, deists, freethinkers, suffragists, feminists, cru saders, sex radicals, humanists, anarchists, abolition ists, rationalists. Some of the names are familiar Jane Addams, Felix Adler, Clarence Darrow, Fred erick Douglass, Desiderius Erasmus, James Farmer, Benjamin Franklin, Emma Goldman, Robert Inger soll, Thomas Paine, M. N. Roy, Margaret Sanger, Roger Williams-but many others are not. There are also some 50 biographies of famous writers, poets, dramatists, and cultural critics, all of whom rejected the orthodoxies of their contempo raries but only some of whom are known for champi oning the cause of reform. These persons range from Ethan Allen, Steve Allen, and Matthew Arnold, at the beginning of the alphabet, to H. G. Wells, Andrew White, and Walt Whitman near the end. Among them are psychologists Sigmund Freud, Erich Fromm, James Henry Leuba, and Wilhelm Reich. They are joined by a long list of famous philosophers, an cient to contemporary, as well as a smaller group of distinguished physical and biological scientists, including Charles Darwin, Galileo Galilei, Stephen Jay Gould, Julian Huxley, and Carl Sagan. And there are still others, ranging from the famous-Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, for example-to the obscure, such as Jean Meslier (1664-1733), a long serving Roman Catholic priest in France who left his parishioners a voluminous testament confessing to his own atheism and his contempt for the rituals he felt compelled to carry out. Persons, of course, represent the living expres sions of unbelief and its near relatives, but equally important are the formally worked-out systems of thought that these persons more or less embody. Thus at the heart of the Encyclopedia is a series of key articles clarifying and providing a history of core terminology. Among the most obvious of these are Agnosticism, Anarchism, Atheism, Determin ism, Freethought, Humanism, Mechanism, Natural ism, Rationalism, Religious Humanism, Secularism, and Skepticism. But one may also find entries on Eu praxsophy, Evidentialism, Existentialism, Nihilism, Noncognitivism, Positivism, Stoicism, and Verifica tionism. Various related movements are represented as well, including Anthroposophy, Anticlericalism, Deism, Ethical Culture, Eugenics, Gay Humanism, the Libertarian Movement, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Unitarianism, and the Women's Suffrage Movement.

Far less obvious than these named movements are ones emerging from within the religious tradi tions themselves. Thus there are articles on unbelief in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, along with related essays on spe cific individuals (e.g., Averroes in the Islamic tradi tion) and issues (e.g., women and Islam). Related to these articles in turn are some two dozen on un belief in particular countries or regions, including the western European countries as well as Africa, Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Latin America, Nepal, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There are also entries on un belief in the American, English, German, Latino, Portuguese, and Spanish literatures. Another major category of entries critically ad dresses a diversity of doctrines, issues, or phenom ena that figure importantly in the major religious tra ditions or in the collisions of these traditions with their skeptical challengers. These entries include: the Bible and Violence; Biblical Inerrancy; Birth Con trol; Blasphemy; Church, State, and Religious Free dom; Circumcision; Creationism; the Devil; Faith Healing; Heresy; Immortality; Intelligent Design Theory; Historicity of Jesus; the Law and Unbelief; Origins of Life; Miracles; Noah's Flood; Paranor mal Belief; Prayer; Reincarnation; Religion in Con flict with Science; Religious and Mystical Experi ence; Resurrection; Revelation; Ritual, Ceremony, and Unbelief; the Shroud of Turin; Speaking in Tongues; and Witchcraft. The social-scientific approaches to religion en ter into the discussion as well, albeit in only a few entries. In addition to the Freud, Leuba, Fromm, and Reich articles, there is a brief one on projec tion theory and a longer one on anthropomorphism and religion. The entry "Belief as a Psychological Phenomenon," written by a philosopher and scholar of religion, takes for granted the appropriateness of the problematical categories of belief and unbelief obviously central to this encyclopedia-and hence leaves them largely unanalyzed. Informative in its own way, this entry has little technical psychology in it. The entry "Cognitive Science and Unbelief," in contrast, lays out some important fundamental principles that all cognitive scientists will recognize; still, of the burgeoning literature on cognitive sci ence and religion, only the work of Pascal Boyer is cited. Worldwide trends in religiosity are examined in the extended essay "Demography of Unbelief," which considers the secularization hypothesis and other possible explanations for these trends, includ ing the exceptionality of the United States. There is also, finally, an article on the "Empirical Study and Neglect of Unbelief and Irreligion," an essay that, along with a summary of statistical trends, offers a broad and well-informed analysis of the problems involved in identifying genuine unbelievers in vari ous empirical studies while it also notes that persons who are affirmatively irreligious are seldom of in terest in their own right. The entry's author, cultural anthropologist Frank Pasquale, has himself engaged in research on such persons. A final category of entries to be identified here encompasses the various associations that have pro moted humanistic or secular views as well as the publications and publishers who have offered these views to a wider audience. Among the organiza tions are the American Humanist Association, the British Humanist Association, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union (a federation of some 100 humanist organizations), all three of which are alive and well today. Many such organizations have come and gone, however, just as freethinker publica tions have. Among the surviving periodicals are the American Rationalist, "from the beginning... .a low tech, volunteer operation" (p. 52); the Freethinker the longest-running British freethought journal; and the Truth Seeker, the world's oldest freethought pub lication, which in recent decades has fallen on hard times, finally lapsing into obscurity. Flynn's evenhanded imposition of the edito rial policies governing which topics were eligible for inclusion meant that the fine publication he himself edits, Free Inquiry-"the world's largest circulation English-language secular humanist mag azine" (p. iv)-is not included as an individual entry in the Encyclopedia. Likewise, denied individual entries-although in this case, too, there are scattered references to them that are noted in the appropri ate indexes-are the Council for Secular Humanism, a national organization founded by the philosopher Paul Kurtz to provide support for nonreligious per sons (it publishes Free Inquiry, for example) and the Center for Inquiry, a multicenter organization, also founded by Kurtz, dedicated to the promotion of sci ence, reason, and free inquiry in diverse arenas. Kurtz is also the founder of Prometheus Press, the pub lisher of this encyclopedia. More information about these organizations can be found on the Internet. Be cause of their ephemeral character, Internet resources related to unbelief (e.g., http://positiveatheism.org/) were also excluded from the Encyclopedia, along with such interesting but likely short-lived phenom ena as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (Henderson 2006). Interested readers, of course, can easily enough track down these things themselves. In his largely critical review of Stein's ear lier version of this encyclopedia, Johnston (1998) characterizes it as a militant work driven by ideol ogy, with writing that is sometimes shrill. Given, however, the vigorous opposition and suffering that freethinkers have faced over the centuries at the hands of dogmatists, inquisitors, and the Anthony Comstocks of the world, it is hard to imagine cre ating an encyclopedia of this sort without these qualities coming through in some measure. The diverse group of 191 contributors to the present incarnation of the encyclopedia, many of whom hold traditional academic positions, includes a good</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 331 number who are obviously more than disinterested observers of the issues and movements that they doc ument. There is no doubt a spirit of judgment in this book-conspicuous, for example, in the articles on Comstock and Creationism-as well as one of ad vocacy. But many readers will both understand and welcome that, especially at a time when conserva tive religious views are increasingly shaping events in the world in ways that many find ominous and disturbing. Some may wish at the same time that more attention was given to ways of relating to reli gious content other than literal belief and unbelief; it remains true, as Johnston says of Stein's collabora tors, that "most of the authors... .have no truck with myth" (p. 262). The entries in this encyclopedia are generally well conceived and well written, and long enough to be truly informative. Nearly all have a list of help ful references at the end. There are three special ized indexes: of organizations and institutions; of published works (nonperiodical); and of periodicals. There is also, then, a general index. In the latter, unfortunately, there is no indication of which terms constitute entries and which page numbers encom pass them. Only rarely is a second level of indexing employed, leaving an unhelpful piling-up of num bers for some terms. This reviewer, at least, would also have welcomed a comprehensive list of the ar ticles, along with a topical outline of them, such as one finds in the recent Encyclopedia of the Enlighten ment (Kors 2003)-a work, by the way, that slightly overlaps with, and helpfully complements, the one under review. These limitations aside, this is another ency clopedic work that deserves a presence not only in libraries but also on the bookshelves of scholars of religion. It will reward both purposive consulta tion and desultory reading, which together cannot but increase one's appreciation for what freethinkers have accomplished, often at considerable personal cost. One hopes that it will also stimulate social scientists of various stripes to undertake research and reflection that will enrich this volume's next reincamation. REFERENCES Babinski, E. T. ed. 1995.
