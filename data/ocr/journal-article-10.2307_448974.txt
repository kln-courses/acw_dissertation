<plain_text><page sequence="1">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy In the American States BENJAMIN RADCLIFF AND MARTIN SAIZ, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME We attempt to bridge the conceptual gap between the black politics and state politics literatures by studying the effect of racial differences in elec- toral participation on public policy. If state politics has considered whether "voters mattei' and black politics has asked whether "black elected officials matter,' we attempt to determine if "black voters matter" In particular, we ask whether, and how, the racial composition of the electorate affects state policies. Our results suggest that the greater black participation relative to that of whites, the less liberal are state policies. The implications for democratic theory and black politics are discussed. If democracy is the process through which society governs itself, then the sub- stance of democratic politics is to be found in the conflict for control over public policies that set the direction of social life. The central concern of em- pirical democratic theory is thus the study of the determinants of public poli- cy. For decades scholars have been involved in such "policy output studies" in an attempt to discover what factors cause governments to pursue their given patterns of policy (for a review, see Boyne 1985). As numerous studies demonstrate, there does in fact appear to be at least some correspondence between what the public appears to wish and the kinds of policies that governments actually produce (e.g., Page and Shapiro 1983; Wright, Erikson, and McIver 1987). Similarly, elected officials appear sensitive to relative rates of participation among social classes, such that the class bias in the electorate is reflected in policy biases (Hill and Leighley 1992). In sum, governments seem to be responsive to the wishes of the public in general, and voters in particular Whatever its many successes, the literature on policy outputs has largely failed to consider the question of race, in the sense that the population which makes demands upon government is typically treated as racially undifferentiated.

The uniform population assumption may be perfectly appropriate for the research ques- tions these authors have examined, but it tells us little about how race affects policy. Such an omission is unfortunate, in that it ignores the particular historical experience of blacks, the persistent socioeconomic disparities between blacks and whites, and the continued racial bifurcation of society (for a discussion, see, for example, Hacker 1992). The absence of attention to race is also trou- bling given that many scholars, black and white, view race as the most salient and persistent political cleavage of the contemporary era (e g. Edsall and Edsall 1991; Carmines and Stimson 1989; Jones 1972; Carmicheal and Hamilton 1967). Of course, the question of race and policy has not escaped notice outside of the state politics literature. Indeed, the principal concern in the field of black politics has been the identification of those factors which contribute to (or work against) the political empowerment of African-Americans. One ap- proach has focused on issues that impede or foster black electoral participa- tion and the election of blacks to various public offices (for a review, see Persons 1987). Similarly, scholars have also examined the impact of black mayors and city council members (e.g., Nelson 1990), black judges (e.g. Spohn 1990), and black administrators within bureaucracies (e.g., Karnig and McClain 1989). These are all perfectly legitimate and important questions that warrant at- tention. Yet, here we face the reverse of the problem with the state policy liter- ature. In the latter, we have rigorous attempts to find evidence of a generalized, systematic causal relationship between participation and policy, but with no sensitivity to race.' In the black politics literature, there is obvious attention to race, but little in the way of hard empirical evidence about how racial differ- ences in political participation affect public policies. We attempt to bridge the conceptual gap between these approaches by studying the consequences of racial differences in electoral participation on 1 The closest approximation of an effort to find systematic evidence for a linkage between black voting and policy is the small literature on the relationship between the size of the black population and the liberalism of Southern representatives in. the U.S Congress or the state legislatures. While some studies suggest that large black populations do in- deed imply more liberal legislative voting (eg., Herring 1990), others find little or no evi- dence for such a relationship (eg., Whitby 1985). 776</page><page sequence="3">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States public policies in the American states.

RACE, TURNOUT, AND PUBLIC POLICY Like most "policy output" studies, our work is grounded in the classical work of V O. Key (1949). One of Key's goals was to understand why some govern- ments are more responsive to the disadvantaged than others. Reflecting his deep belief in the promise of the democratic politics, Key posited that the elec- toral process would produce policies more responsive to the have-nots when political parties vie for advantage among voters. Clearly, Key's logic applies as much to race as to class. Political competition should make parties and candi- dates more responsive to previously disfranchised groups that present an elec- toral "market.' Disappointingly, early work did not confirm Key's expectation. Instead, it appeared that any relationships between state policy and interparty competi- tion or turnout was spurious when controlling for environmental conditions such as economic development (for a review, see Boyne, 1985). Recent evi- dence presents a more serious challenge to the environmental determinants. Wright, Erikson, and McIver (1987), for example, find that the liberalism of state policy varies directly with the liberalism of state public opinion, while controlling for socioeconomic context. In another paper (Erikson, McIver, and Wright 1989), they propose that state party apparatuses have shown the flexi- bility to move toward the ideological predispositions of the electorate, much as the "median voter" model would suggest (Downs 1957). They attribute the motivation to the rational calculations of vote-maximizing parties and politi- cians. This in turn implies that policies will tend to conform to the opinions and preferences of those social groups most likely to vote. Socioeconomic sta- tus, then, facilities (or impedes) the translation of opinion to policy via the process of turnout (Plotnick and Winters 1985). That contention is consistent with Hill and Leighley's (1992) work on the class bias in state electorates. They find that the greater the ratio of wealthy to poor voters, the lower state levels of welfare spending. Put differently, where the disadvantaged tend to vote more relative to the affluent, states spend more. In this way, their study suggests (as one might expect) that social groups which are active electorally are rewarded with public policies which favor them at the expense of groups which participate less. If so, then the obvious question is whether racial bias in the electorate also has policy consequences.2 2 This possibility is also implied by a more subtle implication of Hill and Leighley 777</page><page sequence="4">Political Research Quarterly This issue is particularly compelling when we consider that racial bias is almost completely unrelated to class bias, as evidenced by the fact the correla- tion between class bias (Hill and Leighley 1992) and our measure of mean ra- cial bias by state from 1980-90 (described below) is only .04. Thus, while the traditional difference in turnout between blacks and whites is generally regard- ed as an artifact of socioeconomic status, the fact remains that the differences in racial bias across states cannot be reduced to class. This fact is hardly sur- prising, given that the factors motivating black turnout are more complex than a simple socioeconomic explanation would imply (e.g., Walton 1985). Indeed, a great deal of evidence suggests that blacks tend to vote more than whites of comparable socioeconomic status (eg., Verba and Nie 1972; Kleppner 1982: 117). This tendency seems to have accelerated during the 1980s. Hagen (1988) demonstrates that in 1984 black turnout was about 5 percent higher than white turnout when socioeconomic status is controlled for, whereas Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) report (again, controlling for status) only a trivial difference between the races in 1972. The relative unim- portance of socioeconomic status for African-American turnout stems from the mobilization of young blacks with high levels of racial consciousness (Cavanaugh 1985) and, in general, black citizens with low levels of education and income (Jaynes and Williams 1985). If so, we see, again, that the racial mixture of the electorate need not be strongly related to the class mixture. BLACK PARTICIPATION: A RESEARCH AGENDA As the above discussion makes clear, black turnout is a distinct political varia- ble demanding attention in its own right. Any such endeavor must begin with an understanding of the historical and social context of the black experience. It would make little sense to study conventional black participation before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, given that before this time African-Americans concentrated their efforts on securing basic civil and political rights via the courts and protest. It is only when they secured these rights that blacks began to shift attention to governmental policies designed to alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment, improve education, and provide adequate health care (Hamilton (1992): policymakers are apparently sensitive to the demands of mobilized constituen- cies, even when these constituencies represent only a rather modest share of the total population. They operationalize affluence as a household income of more than $50,000 in 1984. Nationwide, 10.3 percent of households meet this criterion (in 1983, the closest year for which we could locate data). The total black population is actually slightly larger (10.8 percent of households in 1983). If public policy responds to interstate variation in the rate of electoral participation of the wealthy minority (relative to the poor) then it is not unreasonable to consider whether policy responds to variation in the electoral participation of the numerically similar African-American minority (relative to whites). 778</page><page sequence="5">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States 1986). In the process, the black political strategy consciously turned from un- conventional to more conventional participation. In this way, aggressive elec- toral mobilization is an expressly articulated political strategy of the black community as a means to the ends of political and economic power While some elements of the community have questioned the ultimate utility of this approach, the intrinsic value of electoral mobilization has not been seriously questioned. At the risk of anthropomorphism, black political behavior can thus be seen as a series of actions which are strategically and purposefully aimed at achieving a sequential series of political goals. Basic civil and political rights had to be secured prior to mobilization, which in turn was to provide the ve- hicle for further change. Black politics, we would argue, are best understood within the context of strategic choices predicated upon the development of black political power and the subsequent implementation of preferred policy outcomes. This program has been made possible by the high degree of group cohe- sion among blacks. African Americans make up the single most solid voting bloc in American politics, owing to the high level of group consciousness root- ed in black culture and the black political experience (Walton 1985). That co- hesion and solidarity can also be seen in the pattern of black public opinion. As numerous studies document, blacks tend to be considerably more suppor- tive than whites of an activist government that uses state power (and state resources) to rectify social ills (e.g., Silliam and Whitby 1989). In general, blacks are substantially more likely than whites to favor increased spending on an entire range of social services (Davis and Smith 1994), particularly on distributive and redistributive issues (such as welfare) which involve govern- mental aid for the poor and disadvantaged (e.g., Kendrick 1988; Seltzer and Smith 1985). In addition, the distinctiveness of black political views vis it vis whites appears to be consistent across social classes within the black commu- nity (e.g., Jaynes and Williams 1985). While African-Americans are thus quite supportive of policies widely identified as being liberal in character, there is some question as to the degree to which most blacks fall into conventional liberal/conservative categories. In part, this is because black preferences do not always neatly fit the liberal pat- tern; as a group they are, for example, reasonably conservative on some social issues, such as abortion. More importantly, though, most observers of black politics argue that African-Americans are more pragmatic than ideological (for a review, see Jaynes and Williams 1985). Their support of liberal policies is motivated by their goals of political and economic empowerment, and can thus be seen not so much as traditional liberal vs. conservative but more as have-nots vs. haves. Still, it remains the case that so long as we focus on 779</page><page sequence="6">Political Research Quarterly economic and fiscal issues, the collective preferences of the black community can be reasonably characterized as both (a) strongly liberal and (b) much more liberal than that of whites, regardless of socioeconomic status. Given the considerable differences between the policy preferences (and interests) of African-Americans and white Americans, we turn to an examina- tion of how these differences reproduce themselves in state policies in response to the relative rates of participation between these racial groups. Sim- ply put, does the racial composition of the electorate affect public policies? DATA AND METHOD We assess the empirical relationship between a measure of racial bias in tur- nout and quantitative indicators of state public policies. The standard data col- lection on turnout is the voting study conducted biennially by the Census Bureau as part of the Current Population Survey (series P-20). Because of the enormous size of these studies (typically more than 90,000 respondents), it is possible to decompose the data by state and race. We utilize these data to construct an index of racial bias. Our index (RACE) is the ratio of black to white turnout, multiplied by one hundred. When the index assumes the value of 100, rates of participation are equal. Larger values indicate a bias in favor of blacks, while smaller values imply a bias in favor of whites. Thus, the larger the index, the greater the participation of blacks, relative to whites.3 We include within our sample the twenty-six states in which blacks made up more than 5 percent of the population in 1990.4 There are both statistical 3 The reliance on survey data raises the problem of over- reporting. The National Election Studies solve this problem by validating reported turnout, but such is not possible with the Census Bureau data given the size of their sample. Hence, like all others utilizing these data (eg., Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980; Hill and Leighley 1992), we can do little about this problem beyond acknowledging it. Having said that, though, we would argue that over-reporting is not a significant problem for our purposes. We are concerned with the ratio of black to white turnout, b/w. Given over-reporting, we actually compute (b + x)/(w + y), where x, y represent the elevation of reported turnout for blacks and whites, respectively. Evidence suggests that blacks are somewhat more likely to over- report than whites (eg., Abramson and Claggettt 1984), so that x &gt; y Suppose that we assume (plausibly, we think) that this propensity elevates reported black turnout by about 25 percent more than white turnout. If so, then our observed race variable be- comes (b + 1.25y)/(w + y). This term will be correlated with b/w at very near unity, for empirically realistic values of b, w, and y. Accordingly, the statistical estimates report- ed below would be essentially identical to those that would occur in the absence of over- reporting. Of course, over-reporting might vary slightly from year to year or state to state, but such variation is almost certainly very modest. Hence, again, the correlation between the "true" and observed values for our race variable will be virtually 1.0. 4 The states included are: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, 780</page><page sequence="7">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States and substantive reasons for limiting attention to those states with significant black populations. The former concerns the reliability of Census estimates. Where the black population is relatively small (particularly in a state with a low total population), the survey instrument is incapable of providing satisfac- tory estimates of black turnout.5 In regard to the latter, we would argue that the black population must pass some threshold level before elected officials are likely to pay particular attention to them as a group, regardless of their level of turnout. Surely, a tiny minority is unlikely to receive group-relative con- siderations from self-interested political entrepreneurs, even if they were to turnout in disproportionate numbers. We utilize the racial bias index in two ways. First, we adopt a longitudinal approach, wherein we pool data over the six elections for each of the twenty- six states. Second, we use the mean value of the index (MEAN-RACE) over the same elections. In the former, we have a pooled time series analysis, with one observation for each state-year; in the latter, we have cross-sectional data, such that there is one observation per state We rely on two sets of dependent variables. The first, used with the pooled data, is spending in two categories for which blacks (as a group) would appear to have both different preferences and different material interests from whites (as a group). The most obvious of these is real per capita welfare spending (in constant 1982-84 dollars). More than any other single variable, welfare is thought to capture the distinctiveness of black opinion. Seltzer and Smith (1985), for example, report that in 1982 the percentage of blacks favor- ing greater welfare spending was about four times the share of whites so favor- ing. In any case, this variable has been widely used in the study of black politics, not only because of the great disparities in support for welfare be- tween races, but also because blacks (as a group) tend to rely upon such pro- grams to a greater extent than whites. Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin. The racial bias variable has a mean of 81.2 with a standard deviation of 21.1 and a range of 74.3. 5 Four states (Delaware, Kansas, Nebraska, and Nevada) which meet the 5 percent cutoff are not included in our analysis because the Census Bureau samples for those states do not contain enough black respondents to compute (and thus report) reliable black turn- out figures. This occurs whenever the number of eligible black voters is less than 75,000. We would also observe, parenthetically, that for this reason, black turnout figures are also not available for any state below the 5 percent)benchmark. Note also that changing the inclusion criterion from 5 percent of the total population to 5 percent of voting age popu- lation eliminates Massachusetts from the sample, but does not meaningfully affect the reported results. 781</page><page sequence="8">Political Research Quarterly We also examine total state spending on all activities aside from welfare (again, in constant 1982-84 dollars). Given that blacks tend to favor greater spending over a wide range of social activities, and because they tend to sup- port (and, it might be argued, have more of a stake in) an activist state, we would expect that total spending (less that for welfare) would also be related to black participation.6 Another way of testing for a relationship between the liberalism of state poli- cies and the racial bias of the electorate can be accomplished with the cross- sectional data by using a summary index of state policy liberalism as the depen- dent variable We use two such measures, one developed by Klingman and Lam- mers (1984) and the other by Erikson, Wright, and McIver (1987). Both focus on economic and fiscal issues, such as the progressivity of state taxes, and spend- ing on education and welfare Further; to the extent that these touch on other is- sues, they are largely those (such as the death penalty) that blacks tend to be more liberal on than whites (Cain and Kiewiet 1986). It is, of course, necessary to control for other influences on state spending or general policy liberalism besides the racial composition of the electorate. For both the pooled and cross-sectional analyses, we consider two variables widely used in the state politics literature to control for the socioeconomic en- vironment: per capita personal income and the percent of the population residing in urban areas.7 For the pooled data, we also include a set of dummy variables for each of the states, excepting a reference category. Including the dummies fits a separate intercept for each state By so doing, these terms serve two functions. First, they account for the pooled structure of the data by controlling for so- called "unit effects" (Stimson 1985), meaning large and sustained differences in the general, long-term level of the dependent variables (i.e., levels of state spending). In this way, the dummies also fulfill a substantive purpose, in that they control for the general level of spending for each state. Accordingly, they serve as proxies for the full range of potential factors (political culture, inter- party competition, the class bias of the electorate, the size of the black popula- tion, and so on) that might be thought to affect spending.8 6 All spending data are from various editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States (1979-1992). 7 Urbanization data were not available for 1982. To provide an estimate for this year, we used the mean of 1980 and 1984. Data are from the Statistical Abstract of the United States (1986). 8 Indeed, the dummies would be entirely redundant with any such cross-sectional vari- ables, making their inclusion in the model unnecessary. For example, if we were to in- clude the size of the black population (which we measure at the 1990 level, in that we 782</page><page sequence="9">Race, Tumout, and Public Policy in the American States For the cross-sectional data, dummy variables are obviously inappropri- ate. Here, we include (in addition to income and urbanization) a number of additional control variables, viz: (1) Sharkansky's interval (1969) operationalization of Elazar's (1966) con- cept of political culture (SHARKANSKY); (2) the Wright, Erikson, and McIver (1985) measure of state public opin- ion liberalism, as to isolate black voting from general public preferences (IDEOLOGY);9 (3) interparty competition, represented by a folded Ranney index of the period 1981-86 (Bibby et al. 1990), given that welfare spending and other state policies are often thought to be more liberal when parties compete with one another for the support of lower-status citizens (eg., Key 1949) (COMPE- TITION); (4) the percentage of state population that was Black in 1990, so as to separate the effect of Black citizenship from voting per se; and (5) a dummy variable coded one for the 11 states of the old Confederacy, and zero otherwise, to account for the particular historical circumstances of this region (SOUTH). Results Pooled Time Series Data The obvious place to begin our analysis is the simple correlations between racial bias and spending. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the race vari- able with welfare spending and total spending less welfare are, respectively, -.23 and -.28 (both significant at .05 level). Precisely the opposite of what we might expect, the results suggest that the greater black participation is relative to that of whites, the less liberal state spending tends to be. Put another way, as black turnout increases relative to that of whites, spending falls. Correlations, of course, do not separate the effect of racial bias from other factors. To control for such, and to specify the magnitude of the relationship, multivariate techniques are required. Regression models for the spending vari- ables, following the dummy variable specification discussed above, are in Ta- ble 1. As is apparent, the bias coefficients are both statistically significant and negative in sign. With adjusted R2 scores around .90, the models also seem well fitted to the data. The implication is again that the greater black turnout relative to whites, the less generous is state spending. were unable to locate time series data by state) it is necessary to omit one of the state dummy variables to avoid linear dependencies. The coefficient and standard error of the racial bias term would, in any case, be identical. 9 We have used their "weighted" data. 783</page><page sequence="10">Political Research Quarterly Table 1 RACE BIAS AND STATE SPENDING LONGITUDINAL DATA (a) (b) Welfare Total Less Welfare RACE - .430* - 2.33** (,202) (.809) INCOME .012*** .079*** (.001) (.005) URBAN -.798 53.7** (4.56) (18.2) constant 187.9 - 2034.3* (260.9) (1039.6) R2 .93 .90 adjust R2 .92 .88 N 156 156 * significant at .05 level. ** significant at .01 level. *** significant at .001 level.

Cross-Sectional Data As discussed previously, we here assess the relationship between mean race bias for 1980-1990 and two measures of total policy liberalism (Table 2). The racial bias coefficients are significant and negative in sign for both of the dependent variables.10 As with the longitudinal data, the fit of the models is quite good. The magnitude of the relationship is also reasonably pronounced. To take an example, compare states where blacks participate substantially less than whites, such as Connecticut (MEAN-RACE = 72.4), with states where black participation is roughly equal to that of whites, such as California (MEAN- 10 Statistical modeling is always subject to the criticism that the observed results could be attributed to some omitted variable. In an effort to account for such, we added three addi- tional variables: the Wright, Erikson, and McIver (1985) measure of state partisanship, so as to account for variations in policy liberalism that might follow from more Democratic voters, the Erikson, McIver, and Wright (1987) measure of an aspect of politi- cal culture complimentary to Sharkansky's (1969) measure, and the Hill and Leighley (1992) index of class bias, so as to be able to distinguish between class and racial bias. This "kitchen sink" approach lacks elegance, and consumes degrees of freedom, but it increases confidence in the results: the coefficients of interest remain significant and of the correct sign when controlling for every conceivable counter-explanation. 784</page><page sequence="11">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States Table 2 RACE BIAS AND GENERAL POLICY LIBERALISM CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA (a) (b) Wright/Erikson/Mclver Klingman/Lammers MEAN-RACE -.015* -.013** (.007) (.005) INCOME .000 .000 (.000) (.000) URBAN .013* .020** (.008) (.006) SHARKANSKY -.254* -.313 * * (.062) (.047) IDEOLOGY -4.91* -2.58* (2.00) (1.50) COMPETITION -.239 .732 (1.21) (.842) SOUTH -.452* -.311 (.255) (.191) BLACK POPULATION .024 .009 (.015) (.011) constant 3.20* 2.27* (1.34) (1.00) R2 .93 .96 adjusted R2 .90 .95 N 26 26 * significant at .05 level. ** significant at .01 level. *** significant at .001 level.

The difference of about 25 on MEAN-RACE translates, other things being equal, into about -.35 on both the Wright, Erikson, and McIver (1987) and Klingman and Lammers (1984) measures of general policy liberal- ism. Given that both variables have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the racial composition of the electorate is clearly a meaningful deter- minant of the liberalism of state policy. In sum, the data strongly and unequivocally suggest that the racial compo- sition of the electorate has important consequences for public policy, but that these consequences are opposite of those that might be predicted. Heavy turn- out among African-Americans relative to that of whites suggests more conser- vative public policies. 785</page><page sequence="12">Political Research Quarterly Diagnostics Our greatest interest was in ruling out the possibility that the results depend upon one or more unusual cases. To test, we began with an analysis of the studentized residuals. For some models there were a few mildly "suspicious" cases. However, removing these does not greatly affect the estimates." To test further for an artifact due to outliers or other atypical cases (and otherwise to assess robustness), we tested the sensitivity of the models to the exclusion of other cases. For the longitudinal models, we excluded all observations for each individual state and (separately) the cases for all states for each indivi- dual year. For the cross-sectional models, we "jack-knifed" out each state. In no case did these changes produce any dramatic differences in the esti- mates.12 Lastly, the other standard diagnostics suggested nothing untoward for any of the reported models. Plots of predicted versus actual and predicted versus the race variable were unremarkable. DISCUSSION If our findings cannot be attributed to quirks in model specification or the sample, we are compelled to accept that the inverse relationship between black participation and policy liberalism is real. On its face, the implication is that greater black turnout relative to whites is associated with opposition to the public policies favored by the black community. Statistical relationships, of course, say nothing about the direction of causality We see two possible interpretations of the evidence presented thus far. The first is that the observed relationship is a reaction to a political climate hostile to black interests. As we have seen, states with a high ratio of black to white participation tend to have more conservative policies, even when controll- ing for other economic and political factors. It is thus possible that causality runs from conservatism to high black turnout. In this view, African-Americans have turned out at greater rates than whites in conservative states in an (unsuccessful) attempt to liberalize state policy Thus, conservative policies cause blacks to use the ballot box as a method of pressing their interests, such that high black turn- out is a response to conservative policies rather than a cause of them. In particular, the inverse relationship between black participation and policy may be due to the relatively recent black mobilization in the South. The " The closest approximation to an exception is Table 2, column (a), where removing the single case (Indiana) with a moderately large studentized residual reduces the signi- ficance level of the MEAN-RACE variable to .075. 12 Together these tests required estimating a total of 110 models. In 103 of these, the racial bias term is of the correct sign and significant at the .05 level or better. In the remaining seven, the coefficient is significant at the .10 level (and again always of the correct sign). 786</page><page sequence="13">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States states of the old Confederacy traditionally have been very conservative. Fol- lowing the enfranchisement allowed by the Voting Rights Act, African- Americans have predictably endeavored to use elections as mechanisms for securing social progress. Hence, our statistical evidence on a turnout-policy linkage may simply reflect the fact that recently enfranchised blacks have mobilized in an effort to liberalize state policies they find objectionable. If this phenomenon were responsible for our results, then presumably the observed relationship between turnout and policy would evaporate if we con- fined the analysis to only non-Southern states. To test, we replicate our original findings when excluding the eleven Southern states for both the time series (Table 3) and cross-sectional (Table 4) data. Although the sample size is great- ly reduced, in each case the coefficient of the racial bias term remains signifi- cant, of the correct sign, and of the same general magnitude13 Given that our results are unchanged by the exclusion of the South, it seems improbable that they can be attributed to black mobilization in response to conservative Table 3 RACE BIAS AND STATE SPENDING LONGITUDINAL DATA EXCLUDING SOUTHERN STATES (a) (b) Welfare Total Less Welfare RACE -.462* -2.73** (.270) (1.01) INCOME .013*** .075*** (.002) (.006) URBAN 6.50 67.2 (11.4) (42.8) constant -247.0 -2809.5 (665.9) (2500.5) R2 .91 .91 adjust R2 .89 .89 N 90 90 * significant at .05 level. ** significant at .01 level. *** significant at .001 level.

Sub- stantively identical results also obtain when omitting all variables except the racial bias term and the only other obviously significant variable (SHARKANSKY). 787</page><page sequence="14">Political Research Quarterly Table 4 RACE BIAS AND GENERAL POLICY LIBERALISM CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA EXCLUDING SOUTHERN STATES (a) (b) Wright/Erikson/Mclver Klingman/Lammers MEAN-RACE -.022* -.016* (.010) (.008) INCOME .000 .000 (.000) (.001) URBAN .025 .021 (.018) (.015) SHARKANSKY -.028** -.309** (.093) (.075) IDEOLOGY -5.23 -2.75 (3.40) (2.74) COMPETITION .261 1.02 (1.57) (1.27) BLACK POPULATION .052 .006 (.031) (.025) constant 4.38* 2.58 (2.05) (1.65) R2 .90 .93 adjusted R2 .81 .87 N 15 15 * significant at .05 level. ** significant at .01 level.

A second and more straightforward possibility is that causality runs from turnout to policy, such that heavy black turnout, compared to whites, tends to produce a measurable "backlash,' such that public policies become more conservative as blacks vote at higher rates. This perverse form of responsive- ness could in turn come about in two ways. The more academically fashionable would begin with the proposition that democratic procedures should not be judged by their outputs. Pluralist 14 We also performed the analysis on only the 11 Southern states for the pooled analysis. Given the tininess of the sample, the standard errors of the race variable were quite large, such that the coefficients failed to approach significance. They were, however, always of the correct sign. 788</page><page sequence="15">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States theory, after all, does not promise that group demands will necessarily be met. It could be that African Americans have pursued poor or otherwise ill-advised political strategies. In this view, the failure of black participation to affect state policies in the way blacks would like can be attributed to blacks themselves. If so, the implication is that the African-American community would be well served by a reappraisal of its collective approach to politics. While that is certainly a plausible argument, another explanation would ap- peal to the racial conflict paradigm. In this view, political choices which underlie policy outputs "are based on the consideration of race for the purpose of main- taining dominance over blacks" (Carmicheal and Hamilton 1967). This, of course, is precisely what is meant by institutional racism. While this could be interpreted to imply that the political system is anti-black, this is not to say that white voters or policymakers are racist in their conscious intent, but only that institutions themselves function in this way. As black political demands increase, the system compensates by producing outputs that become increasingly contrary to the in- terests of the black community. However radical such a contention may appear; it is a entirely in keeping with the classic literature on racial politics. No less sober an observer than V. O. Key (1949) came to essentially the same conclusion in his analysis of Southern Politics. To be sure, the contemporary relevance of Key's interpretation remains to be seen (particularly when we move beyond the deep south to the nation), but he explicitly argues that the larger the size of the black community in any given jurisdiction, the more anti-black its public policies tend to become. More, Key (1949: 665) recognizes that the "the struggles of politics take place within an in- stitutional framework fixed by considerations of race' so as to maintain "the [po- litical] subordination of the Negro population" Clearly our results are consistent with the spirit of that position. A similar theoretical rationale for this contention can be derived from the power theory of intergroup relations (Giles and Evans 1986). As Giles and Hertz (1994: 317) put it: This approach views relationships between groups as a function of their competitive positions. . . . This competition is conceptualized as contextual- ly conditioned. In contexts where the threat posed by a minority group is high, the dominant group's response is predicted to be more hostile than in contexts where such threat is low. Again, our results are entirely consistent with this perspective. As the ratio of black to white participation increases, the subjective "threat" to white interests also increases, precipitating a "hostile reaction in the shape of policies contrary to the preferences of the minority group. Just as we have seen, the larger black turnout is relative to that of whites, the more the system compensates by enacting policies "hostile" to African-Americans. 789</page><page sequence="16">Political Research Quarterly If true, this has much to say about practical questions of black electoral mobilization. As we have argued above, black politics is very much the politics of pragmatism. The mobilization strategy is an instrumental means to the end of black empowerment. The assumption behind this strategy is that those who participate will be rewarded with policies they prefer In the American political tradition, this proposition is very close to sacred, and leads to the familiar admonition that if minorities want more out of government they should press those demands through conventional electoral channels. On their face, our results suggest the futility of this strategy, at least as far as state politics are concerned. That fact in turn has important political and theoretical consequences. As Lively (1975) suggests, participation is an act of support for the system, and as such, something that benefits society as a whole. The extension of political rights to the previously disfranchised is often conceived of as the price of so- cial peace. Hence, the extension of voting rights to eighteen-year-olds in 1972 was in part an effort to encourage the youth movement to "join the system. Similarly, the Voting Rights Act offered blacks the franchise as a way of shifting their discontent into officially sanctioned channels. Our analysis suggests the following question: how long can (or should) a minority participate through "legitimate" channels when its participation appears to be less than useless? Put differently, why should African Americans choose to press their interests through the ballot box, when their participation may actually be counter- productive? Black political participation is unlikely to produce the policy outcomes that blacks collectively tend to favor This itself is disturbing in its normative implications, but even more unsettling is the fact that our results clearly sug- gest that blacks as a group may have rational incentives to demobilize. If so, then our theoretical understanding of democratic practice may itself be in need of revision. We close with several caveats. First, and most obviously, however sugges- tive our results may be, they are hardly definitive. Further research is required to confirm and elaborate the existence of the "perverse responsiveness" we here document. At best our analysis is thus a beginning rather than an end. We would also observe that our conclusions are applicable only to the re- cent history of state politics. It remains likely that in other contexts black mobilization may have the positive consequences typically assumed. Indeed, it might be argued that the obvious place for black voters to make a difference is local rather than state government, particularly in large cities where the den- sity of the black population provides the opportunity to dominate city coun- cils and elect African-American mayors (Nelson 1990). Studies have shown, for example, that black mayors tend to reduce conflict between the African- 790</page><page sequence="17">Race, Turnout, and Public Policy in the American States American community and the police, increase the likelihood that blacks will get city jobs, and cause more city contracts to be awarded to black contractors (for a review, see Pohlmann 1993). The totality of evidence thus suggests that black mayors do respond to black voters, at least when doing so does not require a significant allocation of funds (Watson 1980). It is also virtually certain that the mere fact of enfranchising African Americans in the South provided at least some momentum for a liberaliza- tion of policies. While testing such a contention is clearly beyond the scope of the present analysis, there is again solid evidence for such an effect (e.g., Keech 1968; Herring 1990). Similarly, it is difficult to deny the importance of blacks as a core constituency of the Democratic party. This surely helps that party, at least, maintain some sensitivity to the interests of African- Americans. Finally, it may also be the case that black mobilization has important con- sequences that transcend immediate policy outputs. In particular, if the familiar arguments about the "educative" or developmental effects of participa- tion (e.g., Pateman 1970) are correct, electoral participation-and political or- ganization more generally-may have critically important consequences for individuals per se and the communities to which they belong.
