Beyrouth, Dar El-Machreq fiditeurs (Imprimerie Catholi que), 1970. This may well be the most important book on Islamic mysticism (Sufism) since the groundbreaking work of Massignon, Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane (1922), and Ritter's immensely erudite Das Meer der Seele (1955). There have, of course, been many books about Sufism, some good, and a few excellent. But</page><page sequence="2">156 REVIEWS OF BOOKS Massignon was almost uniquely equipped, by his vast learning and personal experience, to interpret authentically a genuine mysticism such as that of al-Hallaj, and to provide us with brilliant insights and sure guidelines for appreciating the non-monist Islamic mystics. The latter, I believe, are the only Sufis, poles removed from the cynical definition of mysticism as "something which begins in mist, centers in I, and ends in schism". It is evident that this reviewer has his share of what some will regard as prejudices. I prefer to think of them as con victions which to me seem solidly grounded in philosophy, psychology, and theology. In any case, it seems to me dull, and to a large extent futile, to approach or to write about mysticism and mystics in that detached manner sometimes described by the usually infelicitous phrase: "scientific and objective". If this be obscurantism, it is an obscurantism based on an inevitable obscurity, i.e. a mystery, which, in the last analysis, is truly ineffable. The last word of the preceding paragraph para doxically underlines the problem to which Father Nwyia addresses himself. Fundamentally it is a problem involving human experience and human expression on the one hand, and, on the other, divine and almost annihilating prevenience. Genuine mystical experience is indeed something which "eye hath not seen...". Why, then, should mystics or non-mystics undertake to speak or write about it? Is not this a fruitless attempt, in the words of the old backwoods preacher, "to unscrew the un scrutable" ? At any rate the attempt has been made, and it resulted in the creation of a new language. In his excellent "Introduction" Father Nwyia describes movingly the impact of his first encounter with the language of the Sufis, so "real" in comparison with an Arabic "which was closed in upon itself and the words of which hid things instead of revealing them". Happily he was led to improve his acquaint ance with the Sufis and, after publishing various studies and texts, to undertake the present significant work. For good reasons his point of departure is the Koran. But his method differs from that of Massignon and some others. The latter chose to analyse the Koran with a view to discerning in it the germs of mystic life and the possibilities which meditation on the Koran offered to a Muslim of rising to a religious life surpassing pure legalism. The danger in this method is that it may lead the non-Muslim reader to introduce subjective elements deriving from his own religious, or non-religious, tradition and experience. Of the Koran, perhaps more than of any other book, it is true to say that one will find in it what one seeks. Father Nwyia, on the contrary, has chosen to interrogate, not the Book, but Muslim readers of the Book, to find out what they discovered in it of inspiration and support for a spiritual and mystic life which, in some cases, attained great heights. In following this method he has selected authors whose works were for the most part unknown, and in most cases unedited. This gives his book a unique value, further enhanced by his sure and sympathetic use of his sources. Inspired directly by Massignon's Essai, he found in Ritter's work a negative norm in the sense that it dispensed him from redoing or restating what Ritter had already done and stated so well. And instead of following the evolution of Sufism by a study of certain major themes (as he first thought of doing), he has devoted his meticulous attention and un doubted talents to "analyzing the works of certain great mystics to discern that evolution in the progressive interiorization of the Koranic vocabu lary and its integration by an experience creating its own language". The bulk of the book consists of four long chapters. The first (pp. 19-108) is entitled "Koranic exegesis and the birth of a language". It is devoted to Muqatil b. Sulayman (d. 150/767) and his com mentary on the Koran, al-Tafsir al-kabir, which is extant in several manuscripts. Ch. ii (pp. 109-88) is entitled "Experience as a hermeneutical principle". The textual bases of this chapter are Muqatil's Kitab al-wujuh wa-l-naza'ir ("Aspects and con cordances"), and Kitab tahsil nazWir al-qur'an ("Acquisition of the Koranic concordances") of al-Tirmidhl al-Hakim (d. 285/898), and the Com mentary of Ja'far al-$adiq (d. 148/765), of which Father Nwyia had previously published a critical edition. An appendix to this chapter (pp. 188-207) contains a valuable list of the technical terms used by Ja'far and is a fine example of the kind of painstaking work recommended by Massignon. Ch. iii (pp. 209-310) is entitled "Structure and vocabulary of experience". The authors used here are Shaqlq al-Balkhi (d. 194/810) and his Adab al-Hbadat, and Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz (d. 286/899?) and five of his opuscula. The two most important are Kitab al-sifat ("Book of the attributes") and Kitab al-haqcfiq ("Book of the true meanings", i.e. of words). The latter is, where apposite, illustrated by remarks taken from al-Tirmidhi's Kitab ma'rifat al-asrar ("Book of the knowledge of secrets"). The fourth and final chapter (pp. 311-407)</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 157 is entitled "From images to symbols of experience". In it are exploited Maqamat al-qulub ("The stations of hearts") of Abu 1-Hasan al-Nuri (d. 295/907) and Kitab al-mawaqif wa-l-mukhatabat of al-Niffari (d. second half of the 4th/10th cent.), edited and translated by Arberry in 1935. Since then more manuscripts have come to light and Father Nwyia has been able to profit from the fullest of them all, Haci Mahmud, No. 2406. Since there are numerous bibliographies on Sufism, Father Nwyia confines his to the works and articles he has cited. The book concludes with three excellent indexes: citations from the Koran, proper names, and technical terms. The preceding bare outline gives no real idea of the rich material sensitively studied and perceptively commented on by Father Nwyia. A few further details may serve to indicate, still very inadequately, the principal subjects and ideas. Since everything in Islam starts from, or leads back to, the Koran, one would judge a priori that the language of Islamic mystical experience had its origin in the Koran. To verify, or disprove, this judgment the most ancient available Koranic exegesis must be examined. Father Nwyia has wisely chosen to consult Muqatil b. Sulayman, whom Massignon called "le premier grand commentateur du Coran". This choice, apart from other good reasons, was dictated by the fact that one of Muqatil's works was taken up again and criticized by al-Tirmidhi. Muqatil's reading of the Koran followed a triple method: literal, histori cal, allegorical. The "literal" reading is illustrated by an analysis of certain words which have a special importance in the technical lexicon of Islamic mysticism, such as dhikr, faqir, ghayb, haqq, etc. On the "historical" level {asbab al-nuzid: historical context of particular revelations) Muqatil remains within a fairly narrow circle from which he escapes to some extent by his third, or "allegorical", reading of the sacred texts. This third reading is amply illustrated by examples which reveal the beginnings of a spiritual interpretation and a "pluralist" language. Muqatil's Kitab al-wujuh wa- l-nazd'ir was a land mark in the history of Koranic exegesis. It is treated rather briefly, because much the same ground was covered in greater detail by al-Tirmidhi. In the latter we encounter a new principle of exegesis: religious experience, as lived during the fertile century of history which separated al-Tirmidhl from Muqatil. The work of al-Tirmidhi is "one of the oldest attempts to define Islamic religious terms on the basis of the Koranic vocabulary''. Father Nwyia gives us an excellent idea of al-Tirmidhi's work and of his method by presenting, with illuminating comments, his treatment of 23 terms. Whereas Muqatil was a "pious" Muslim, al-Tirmidhi is a mystic who reads his Koran introspectively. This introspective reading is strikingly exemplified in the Tafsir ("Commentary") of Ja'far al-$adiq, one of the oldest witnesses to Islamic spirituality and to a symbolic exegesis founded on personal experience. Ja'far was a contemporary of Muqatil, yet his relation to the Koran was different from that of Muqatil. It is the difference separating the experi mental from the imaginary. Father Nwyia illustrates the importance of Ja'far as a true and influential master of Sufism in his discerning pages, based on Ja'far's Commentary, describing the progress from imagination to experience, the jafr (significance of the isolated letters at the beginning of certain chapters of the Koran), the structure of mystical experience, and the Prophets as figures of mystical experience (Moses and shaft, or theopathic locution, and Muhammad and the vision of the heart). Personally, I found these pages, and those devoted to al-Niffari, the most significant and suggestive sections of the book. After his analysis of the vocabularies of Muqatil and al-Tirmidhi, Father Nwyia turns to a third lexicon, that of the "tongue of Sufism", Aba Sa'id al-Kharraz. At this spiritual summit "the mystic, having assimilated and made his own the Koranic language, becomes, no longer an exegete of the Koranic vocabulary, but an exegete of his own experience and of the language of this experience". An excellent introduction is provided by an illu minating exposition of a hitherto unexplored and almost unknown work of Shaqiq al-Balkhi des cribing the four "stations", or mansions (manazil), by which "the people of sincerity" (ahl al-sidq) ascend to God. Of the five opuscula of al-Kharraz utilized by Father Nwyia, I can only underline the importance of Kitab al-sifat, which is completely translated, and Kitab al-haqafiq. The latter is a lexicon in which al-Kharraz passes in review 72 words of the vocabulary of mystical experience. It is not, however, a simple technical lexicon, but "an analysis of the elements making up the experience starting from the words which symbolize these elements". Father Nwyia's presentation and analysis of al-Kharraz's pregnant vocabulary are extended and brilliant. From the study of the vocabularies of Muqatil, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Kharraz, Father Nwyia proceeds to the investigation of the images and symbols used</page><page sequence="4">158 REVIEWS OF BOOKS by certain Sufis to express what was beyond and above the limits of technical expression. Here we are in the domain of ishara (allusive language) as distinct from that of 'ibara (technical expression). It is, of course, not surprising that the higher stages of mystical experience are beyond precise formula tion in ordinary, or even technical, human language. The difference between images and symbols seems to lie mainly in the fact that the former are extrinsically related, and the latter intrinsically related, to the experience lived by the mystic. The sensitive, but audacious, al-Ndri provides examples of images in a kind of prose poem entitled Maqamat al-qulub ("The stations of the hearts": edited else where by Father Nwyia). The images used fall into three groups: images of house and citadel, images of garden and trees, and images of water and fire. The functions of fire are also attributed to light, and a final reference to the famous Light-verse of the Koran introduces us into the domain of symbolic language. Discussion of the Light-verse leads back to the basic problem of mysticism and theology, viz. " the possibility and the means which man has of knowing God and of speaking about Him". Father Nwyia acutely observes that the three intellectual attitudes of tashbih (gross anthropomorphism), tal(il (agnostic nominalism), and tanzih (abstract transcendentalism) are basically identical, and that the Islamic theolo gians really say no more than is said in the Koran. The mystics, on the other hand, do have more to say, but only by recourse to non-conceptual, symbolic discourse. In this area of symbols Father Nwyia chooses as guide "the confidant of God", al-Niffari. Why? First because al-Niffari, despite Arberry's excellent edition and translation, "est un auteur inconnu ou mal connu ou meme meconnu de ceux qui s'interessent a l'histoire de la mystique musulmane". The second reason is that al-Niffari's work is the best example of the use of symbolic language and a last great work by the last great mystic of the school which began with al-Hasan al-Basri. It is impossible here even to attempt a summary of the citations and comments presented by Father Nwyia. But I feel safe in assuring the reader that these pages devoted to al-Niffari, though difficult to read, come closer than anything I know to a revelation of the secret of genuine Sufism and an interpretation of the ultimate human language of the mystics?"a language which expresses itself beyond all anthropomorphism, because in it the word has assumed a body under the form of the symbol". The only criticism I dare offer of this splendid book is that Father Nwyia perhaps says too much, and certainly too little: too much in the sense that his work is conceived and executed on vast lines involving a necessary scamping of some details; too little in the sense that so many avenues are opened which one can only hope will be explored further by Father Nwyia and others. The great al-Ghazali reminds us that mystics are men of practice ('amal) rather than men of knowledge ('Urn), and that one can go only so far in learning Sufism from men or books. Beyond reading and study, beyond language and image, lies the ineffable secret of the symbol, the reality which can be grasped only by dhawq, fruitive personal experience. Here, also, many are called but few are chosen. We must be grateful to Father Nwyia for his precious docu mentation and penetrating analysis, and above all for leading us to a threshold and opening up vistas by his history of the genesis of a theandric language, i.e. "the history of the experience man has of his existence as one in which God reveals Himself as at once immanent and transcendent, just as He had revealed Himself in His book as at once Zahir and Batin, Hidden in His mystery and Patent in His word, which is a word borrowed from man".
