<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT THOUGHT IN TRANSLATION RODOLFO MONDOLFO: II Pensiero Antico. Storia della filosofia Greco- Romana esposta con testi scelte dalle fonti. Pp. vi+644. Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1950. Paper, L. 3000. FIRST published in 1927, this book has since passed through two Spanish editions at Buenos Aires, and on these this, the second Italian, edition has been based. Mondolfo's plan resembles the well-tried method of Ritter and Preller; he sets out the history of Greek and Greco-Roman philosophy, from the beginnings down to Proclus, in a series of extracts from original sources and the writings of the philosophers. But there are differences. The extracts are in Italian; notes and introductions are much more extensive; and there is a 6o-page synthesis at the end. It is thus intended not merely to illustrate and assist, but to provide an exposition of ancient thought which shall be 'complete in itself'. The selection of passages has been admirably done. The translations are clear, containing all those small additions which are required for explicit- ness. The themes and theses into which each philosophy is analysed follow one another in as 'togical and organic' an order as could well be expected. A</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 25 comprehensive bibliography points the way to more specialized study; and there is a useful index. The notes are very helpful, and often bring out interesting points of detail which are neglected (but ought not to be) in less general treatises, e.g. the difference between 'having a harmony' and 'being a harmony' in the treat- ment of the Pythagoreans, or the question how a 'form of evil' can receive its reality from Plato's form of good. I believe that Mondolfo might with advan- tage have increased his own contributions of this kind to replace, for example, some at least of the extracts from the doxographers, which are not always to be taken literally. A critical section on the nature of these sources is in any case a desideratum. In the case of those authors who do not need to be studied in fragments it is perhaps questionable whether the method of fragmentation provides the right approach for the student. But at least every effort has been made to keep the presentation as complete and as balanced as possible; though I have noticed a slight tendency to telescope two passages which are not really on the same subject, as the intervening matter would show if it had been sup- plied. Sticklers for chronology might object to his order of passages from Plato. They might not care to see extracts from Crito and Laws set down under the same heading. On the other hand, these documents have some remarkable resemblances; and it is right that these should not be ignored. Some minor figures, like Archelaus, have been omitted. But by way of compensation there are items which do not appear in Ritter and Preller: e.g. the section on the Sophists contains extracts for Prodicus, Antiphon, Critias, Thrasymachus, and Callicles. These help to make the picture fuller. Similarly there are extracts to cover the earlier stages of Aristotle's development. Mondolfo does more justice than has for some time been fashionable among British scholars to the conceptual content of Oriental and Greek myth, and to the 'scientific' spirit of much of the mathematics and astrology of Egyptians and Babylonians. He does not neglect the cosmic speculations and ethical doctrines of early Greek poetry or the 'mythical vesture' of much early Greek philosophy. He perhaps insists too much on the 'anthropomorphic' character of Ionian 'physics'; this is a strange feature in one who follows Burnet in finding these thinkers influenced by meteorology rather than biology. Not everyone will agree that Heraclitus taught the doctrine of cyclic universal conflagration or that he learned it from Chaldaic-Babylonian astrology; or that the 'forms' begin to move and live in Plato's Sophist; or that there is an 'evil cosmic soul' in Laws x. These are the only exceptions which I have observed throughout the book to the practice of providing sufficient warning when the preferred inter- pretations have been called into serious question.
