BENEDICT SOANS2 Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850 USA Abstract. By means of mathematical models and an experimental system we argue that density-dependent genetic feedback has the potential to regulate the amount of energy taken by a predator (parasite and herbivore) population from the prey or host population. The ex- perimental system was a simulation using the housefly, Musca domestic, with artificial re- production and prey, thereby restricting predator population feeding and adjusting it to sur- plus energy of the prey or host population. The experimental predator population, controlled by genetic feedback, was adjusted to a mean density of about 53 animals and in turn was re- moving less than the total amount of energy available from the prey population. The control predator population, regulated only by competition, fluctuated wildly about a mean density of about 147 animals, and consumed about 78% of the energy available from its prey popula- tion. Fluctuations existed in the experimental predator population, but were significantly damped compared with those in the control. These results generally complement those of earlier mathematical models, and support the idea that prey evolution can enhance predator stability and lead to a balanced supply-demand economy between predator and prey. In nature, the genetic feedback mechanism must function interdependently with other population control mechanisms, but the attempt here is to isolate the mechanism and assess its effect. Key words: Density; energy; evolution; feedback; genetics; housefly; parasites; population; predators; regulation. INTRODUCTION Fundamental among the forces leading to a "balance in nature" is the evolved supply-demand energy economy that functions among predator-prey, parasite-host, and herbivore-plant systems. Atten- tion in this paper is directed to predator-prey systems, although similar conclusions apply in all exploiter- victim systems. Elton (1927) pointed out that "the whole structure and activities of the community are dependent upon the questions of food supply" (energy). From an anthropomorphic view, it is obivous why a predator should not destroy its prey population, since in so doing it ultimately destroys itself. Thus the advantage to the predator of a balanced supply-demand economy is clear. Such arguments, however, beg the question of how such balance can evolve. All living things tend innately to increase and convert as much of their environment into themselves and their young as possible. Yet despite this evolved tendency, preda- tors, in nature, do not totally destroy their prey (Slobodkin 1961), parasites their hosts, or her- bivores their food supplies (Hairston et al. 1960). Trees and other plants generally remain green and lush and only rarely are severely injured by intense 'Manuscript received 13 August 1973; accepted 30 July 1974.

As is made clear from a wide range of examples, herbivores usually assimilate less than 20% of available energy. That prey usually give up only a small portion of their protoplasm to feeding predator populations is not surprising when it is recognized that large quantities of energy are needed for growth, main- tenance, and reproduction of the prey population. For respiration alone, Odum (1959) calculated that the percentage of gross production lost in plants ranges from 13% to 58%. The energy necessary for growth, maintenance, and reproduction of the prey population is "essential" or "capital" energy; the energy which the predator population consumes is "surplus" or "interest" (harvestable) energy. To survive, a predator population must feed only on surplus prey or interest of the prey population, as opposed to capital. Such "prudent predators" need not be explained solely through farsighted predator evolution or group selection, but are a simple con- sequence of heightened prey selection for resistance in heavily exploited populations, counterbalanced by selection against resistance as an unnecessary expendi- ture of energy when the prey is not threatened. As a referee has vigorously pointed out, this is not the only mechanism which can provide the coexistence; but we argue that it is the simplest. The importance of interactions between popula- tion densities and population genetics was emphasized by Ford (1931) and Haldane (1956), and logically extended by Pimentel (1961) in his notion that genetic change in one population can serve to regu-</page><page sequence="2">382 D.

With regard to predator-prey systems, the two basic axioms allowing for this genetic feedback mechanism seem unchallengeable: 1) Changes in the genetic constitution of a prey population will affect the growth rate of a predator dependent upon it; 2) Some evolution in prey populations will be in response to predation pressure, and hence will be affected by predator density. The following critical questions remain: i) Are these two processes commensurate in time scale and importance, so that genetic change in prey and density change in predator will interact in a mutually causative process? A critical point which the theoretical treatment demonstrates (Levin and Udovic, unpubl. manuscript) is that in systems in which evolu- tion is too rapid, no polymorphic equilibrium is possible. Rather, the prey simply fixes for resistance. On the other hand, maintenance of genetic flexibility via polymorphisms pro- vides the potential for dealing with new threats and environmental variation. Thus, short gen- eration time and rapid evolutionary response, as in phytoplankton, may result overall in inability to restrict predation. ii) If such interaction occurs, when will it be stabilizing and when destabilizing to the sys- tem? iii) How important is this interaction in relation to other interactions taking place? That is, in natural systems, can genetic feedback operate as the major limiting factor for one species; does it interact strongly with other major feedback loops, such as the one be- tween predator and prey population densities; or is it swamped by other loops, for example by evolution in the predator to overcome prey resistance? The schema for answering these questions has been first to construct model systems, mathematical and experimental, in order to demonstrate the po- tential for genetic feedback as a stabilizing force; that is, to examine it as a fundamental interaction isolated from other mechanisms. Such understand- ing of the fundamental nature of the genetic feedback loop per se is critical to an understanding of more complex systems in which it is simply one con- tributor among several. One of the goals of such model systems is to explore the robustness of the mechanism: i) How dependent is its success upon the specific forms of the relationships assumed: that is; how structurally stable is the system? ii) What is the effect of the complications of multiple alleles or multiple loci? Demonstration of the robustness of model genetic feedback systems is an essential first step in the elucidation of these questions. The second and third steps, consideration of model systems with more complex interactions and field testing of the theory, will provide the ultimate tests. To this end, the models will provide critical clues for field investiga- tion, just as the mathematical models have proved valuable for laboratory experiments. This paper provides only partial answers to these questions. MODELS The model originally suggested by Pimentel (1961) as well as that studied by Levin (1972) were single- locus, two-allele models; both demonstrated that, even in this simplest of evolutionary systems, genetic feed- back could operate to limit predation to levels far below saturation values. By itself, genetic feedback in prey regulates predators. In nature, genetic feed- back, in conjunction with direct density dependence</page><page sequence="3">Early Spring 1975 EVOLUTION OF BALANCE AMONG POPULATIONS 383 of predator dynamics, will serve to limit predator populations at levels below that to be achieved by intraspecific competitive density dependence in the predator alone. This is accomplished without the depletion of the prey population which would neces- sarily accompany regulation via prey abundance. Demonstration through mathematics alone that genetic feedback can operate does not prove, of course, that it ever does. Although the laboratory is still not nature, a great deal more confidence can be gained from laboratory demonstrations of the prin- ciple. This paper reports on one such demonstration, in which an evolving "prey" population effectively limited predator feeding pressure and numbers in dramatic contrast to the control system, in which predators fed heavily upon prey with resultant severe fluctuations in density. DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENT The greatest difficulty in laboratory demonstra- tions of genetic feedback is the choice of a prey pop- ulation with sufficiently short generation time and readable genetics. To meet this difficulty in these early experiments, we developed an artificial plant consisting of a glass vial (3 cm X 3 mm ID) filled with "sap" (0.25 M sucrose solution) as food re- source for the predator, Musca domestic. The open end of the vial was plugged with a small piece of plastic sponge. When the vial was inverted, the ani- mal was able to feed upon the sap. The resistant factors were added by introducing salt (NaCl) into the sap. Resistance in this case was quantitative and additive, with each additional re- sistant allele contributing 0.1 M of NaCl, with a maximum concentration of 0.6 M NaCl. A plant with a genetic makeup of three loci and six alleles (two per locus) was used, although the number of alleles or loci appears unlikely to be critical to the system. Indeed, the results of this paper complement the earlier one-locus mathemati- cal results. Two alleles were available to the plant at each locus: A,a at the 1st; B,b at the 2nd; C,c at the 3rd; the upper case alleles carried the resistant factor. Since resistance was additive, the 27 geno- types compacted into 7 phenotypes, the most re- sistant being AABBCC. Preliminary tests established that at maximum resistance little or no animal feeding occurred. Plant genotypes were located at random in the designated 100-plant locations in the upper part of the population cage. To isolate the genetic response in the plant from the density response, we held the plant population at constant density. This restriction does not imply that genetic effects act alone in nature; our purpose was to study the genetic response as a "fundamental interaction." For the multilocus case, consideration of the geno- typic frequencies gives way to consideration of the gametic frequencies subsequent to meiosis. Follow- ing Lewontin and Kojima (1960) and Lewontin (1964), we identify the eight gametic types gi (i= 0, . . . , 7), each with corresponding frequency xi. At each locus two states of the gene are possible: A and a, B and b, C and c; and the binary equivalent of the subscript i clearly identifies the gametic type. Thus go is abc; and g, is abC, since 1 -- 001. Simi- larly, g2 = aBc, g3 = aBC, g4 = Abc, g5 = AbC, g6 = ABc, and g7 = ABC. Then the change in xi in each generation is given (Lewontin 1964) by the formula Axi = [xi (Wi. - W) -p (xi, R) ] /W. Here, Wij = fitness of genotype formed by gi and gj, Wi = E W1jxj, and - j W = 'Y Wi .Xj Moreover, the recombination function p(xi, R) is given by 3 p (xi, R) ZRa Z (xixk- XilXn) Wju a=1 Qja Here (Lewontin 1964) Rot = one of the recombination fractions between two loci, and H = number of heterozygous loci in zygote j k. Qa {j, k, 1, m: a) gjgk and glgm can each produce gi, pos- sibly by some recombination event. b) gjgk and glgm are both heterozygous for the two loci in question, and must rep- resent the same genotype. c) gjgk is in the same linkage phase (at TABLE 2.

For our purposes, there is no linkage and so Rc,- ? for each a (the case Ra, = 0, complete linkage, would be functionally equivalent to a four-allele single locus model). Further, as mentioned, the 27 genotypes are compacted into 7 phenotypes depending only on the total number (O to 6) of resistant genes (A,B,C) inherited (Table 2). The fitness Wj of phenotype (Roman numeral) J (possessing J resistant genes) is dependent certainly upon predator densities, and to some extent as well on genotypic frequencies. This frequency dependence is largely due to prey selection by predators. In the absence of predation, however, fitnesses were assumed frequency independent, and taken to be multiplicative. That is, for N = 0, the relative fitness W. was W, = (1-S)' where S = 0.1. When N 7 0, zygotes were en- tered into the system with the preceding rela- tive proportions, which were then subjected to predation. Hence, Wj is for N #- 0 a complicated function of the gametic frequencies (and of N), and mathematical analysis cannot be performed until the forms of the functions can be specified. Generally, however, mathematical analysis of multiple locus models makes clear that, even without linkage, epistatic interactions may cause a permanent "dis- equilibrium" between loci (quasi-linkage equilib- rium (Kimura 1964)); and that such disequilibrium is a measure of the degree of epistasis. The experi- ment described showed not only that mean resistance and predator density reached equilibrium with each other, but that the predicted "disequilibrium" was also present. Computation of the particular dis- equilibrium coefficients for two loci at a time (e.g. (AB) (ab) - (Ab) (aB), where (AB) for example is the frequency of individuals with A at the first locus and B at the second), showed that these values do seem to be converging to values between -.01 and -.04: however, these data were too unsettled for more accuracy (Fig. 1, Table 3). For the particular experimental run described, starting gametic frequencies were as follows: ABC ABc AbC Abc aBC aBc abC abc x x, V vx X, -l V - x Experimental .015 .040 .040 .025 .040 .025 .025 .790 Control .000 .000 .000 .000 .000 .000 .000 1.000 These frequencies were somewhat arbitrary, but were selected so that the system was as far from equilibrium as possible. In general, convergence to equilibrium will depend upon starting frequencies and random initial fluctuations, and one experi- mental run provides little data regarding the basin of attraction of the equilibrium. It demonstrates, how- ever, that such a basin does exist. The only other such experiment, Pimentel and Soans (1971), also demonstrating convergence, is clouded by the fact that disequilibrium was effectively ignored in the paper, and thus is equivalent to the unrealistic con- dition R, - I in the mathematical model.</page><page sequence="5">Early Spring 1975 EVOLUTION OF BALANCE AMONG POPULATIONS 385 90' s0 70 o 60 50 40 30 20 10 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 NaCt (molar) FIG. 2. Percentage animal survival over a 4-day period on monocultures of the various plant genotypes. Plant death was determined by the amount of energy lost, any plant losing 50% or more of its sap being considered unable to reproduce. Again, the value assigned is arbitrary, but the effect is quantita- tive, not qualitative. The animal used in the population study was the female housefly. In preliminary experiments, about 90% of the animals lived for 4 days when fed only on the 0.25-M sugar solution; and so 4 days was designated as the generation period for the experi- ment. At low densities (&lt; 100 flies) animal survival for the 4-day period on monocultures of the various plant genotypes was as shown in Fig. 2. At the end of each 4-day generation period, each surviving ani- mal was replaced by two "offspring." Hence, for equilibrium to occur, 50% of the flies had to die each generation. Despite the highly stochastic nature of the 100-plant arrangment, this equilibrium was ap- proximately achieved in the experimental system. Over the last 10 generations of the experiment, total animal survival was 48.9%. The control plant population consisted of 100 vials filled only with 0.25-M sugar solution; no resistant genes (NaCl) were present. Because the animals could consume all the sap in each plant without affecting the reproductive survival of a genotype, more food was available to the control population than to the experimental population. The animal-plant populations were housed in cages consisting of transparent plastic boxes 13 X 25 X 36 cm. The 100 plants (vials) were inverted and placed in holes in the lid with about one-sixth of the vial at the open end extending below the lid. Thus the vial opening plugged with plastic sponge was inside the cage and the animal could feed on the sap. The cages were uniformly illuminated from above by diffuse, no-directional light. To start both the control and experimental systems, 50 newly emerged female flies of uniformly large size were introduced into each population cage. Tem- perature was maintained at about 250C (? 1.5). Humidity was maintained at 95% (? 3%) RH to limit evaporation from the sugar and salt solutions used in the plants. The control system had one variable-only animal numbers could change. In the experimental popula- tion systems, however, there were two variables: (1) the genetic makeup of the plant population and (2) animal numbers. Therefore, in the experimental system the genetic makeup of the plant populations was determined to some extent by animal numbers, and in turn affected animal numbers. The essentials were thus present for a genetic feedback mechanism to operate. RESULTS After the initial adjustment period (20 genera- tions), the mean density for the experimental animal population (from the 21st through the 45th genera- tion) was 53; whereas the mean density for those 25 for the control animal population was 147 (over- all mean 181 for 45 generations) (Fig. 3, Table 3), about three times that of the experimental popula- tion. At the higher densities of the control popula- tion, crowding effects became evident on susceptibles, and mean survival fell off. The amplitude of the fluctuations in animal num- bers was significantly less in the experimental than in the control population system (Fig. 3, Table 3). After the 21st generation, density in the experimental population ranged from a mean low of 37 to a mean high of 75 animals; in the control, the fluctua- tions ranged from a mean low of 71 to a mean high of 260. In generations 8, 14, 21, 32, 37, and 43, the control population crashed from peak densities to extreme lows in just one generation. When the control animal population was in the range &lt; 100 in which the experimental population stabilized, growth was approximately exponential, indicating the absence of direct density-dependent effects in the animal dynamics. Therefore, since stabilization in the experimental system was about 50 individuals, control must have been due almost entirely to the only other variable, prey genetics (Fig. 3). In the control system, density-dependent effects took place only at high animal densities (&gt; 200), causing precipitous crashes that were absent after generation 21 in the experimental system. The mean rate of population increase per individ- ual for the experimental system was only 1.37 com- pared to 1.62 for the control. The mean rate of population decline per individual for the experimental system was only 0.36 compared to 0.65 for the control (rate of increase [decline] per individual calculated</page><page sequence="6">386 D.

The evolution that occurred in the plant population accounted for the significant changes observed in the experimental population system. Initially, the resistant genes in the plant population had a mean frequency per locus of only 0.12; hence, the plant population consisted primarily of susceptibles.

From the 3rd to the 10th generation the number of resistant genes increased from 0.18 to 0.55 and from the 12th generation on, the frequency fluctuated with damped oscillations between 0.65 and 0.82, converging to about 0.71. There were differences between loci: locus 1 at about 0.80, locus 2 at 0.82, and locus 3 at 0.50. Joseph Felsenstein has incisively pointed out to us that for similar situations (additive phenotypes) when fitnesses are density-independent, stable polymor- phisms do not involve more than one locus, and this may well be the case even here (in the density- dependent case). Indeed, as noted later, the system may already be moving towards fixation at locus 3. The system is, however, not quite the same as a density-independent one-Fig. 5 is an evolved pat- tern-and it is not possible to say precisely to what extent the results in the density-independent case (Lewontin 1964, Singh and Lewontin 1966) are transferable. Because the plant genetic system consisted of more than one locus, a disequilibrium resulted, reached asymptotically. The measures of disequilibrium were DAB= (AB) (Ab) = (AB) (ab) - (aB) (Ab) AB (aB) (ab)- and DAC (aC) (ac) = (AC) (ac) - (aC) (Ac) and (BC) (Bc) DBC (bC) (bc) = (BC) (bc) - (bC) (Bc) where (AB), for example, is the frequency of gametes with A at one locus, B at the second. At equilibrium D = 0; but at disequilibrium 0 &lt; IDI ? 1/4 (Li 1955). The disequilibrium as measured by D roughly declined for all D's with time and was rela- tively stable after generation 30 (Fig. 1, Table 3). No D stabilized at zero, because of the epistatic selection pressures. Perhaps the meaning of the pair-wise disequilibrium coefficients becomes clearest when they are written as covariances. Identify each gamete by a triple (i, j, k), where i = 0 or 1 according to whether a or A is present, and similarly for i (and B) and k (and C). Then DAB = [(i i)(j j)], DAC [ (i - i) (k -k) and DBC: = [-i(k -k)] Here the superior bar denotes the mean.

DABC = L = [ (i- i) (j-j) (k- k) ] In general, L &lt; 1/8, but L = 0 if there is no dis- equilibrium. In our data, L oscillated about zero without clear pattern, but rarely exceeded .01 in magnitude. Introduction of (A) = i, (B) = (C) = k, DAB, DAC, DB(C, and L as new variables provides a full set of variables which serves to replace the gametic frequencies. The gametic frequencies can be recovered easily via simple formulae (Table 4). The stabilization at mean resistance of about 0.71 of the maximum resistance, corresponding to an average of 4.26 resistant alleles/plant, was in accord with calculated relative fitnesses (Fig. 5). Fitnesses were products of environmental survival ( 1 - S) J and survival of predation, where S = 0.1; and settled down to those values shown in the figure. Clearly, maximal fitness belongs to the phenotype with resis- tance level equal to 0.4, with type V phenotypes slightly favored over type III; and this accords excellently with the fact that the system stabilized at a mean resistance of 0.426, approximately the population optimum. There was no overall advan- tage to the system to maintain three segregating loci; indeed, three loci tended to increase the load by main- taining higher numbers of heterozygotes and a broader distribution of phenotypes. The system counteracted this by magnifying random drift of alleles away from the mean at critical stages (Fig. 4). For example, chance fluctuations between genera- tions 10 and 20 resulted in a higher frequency of gamete ABc than was expected.

Predator selection of prey caused a higher prey resistance to evolve than would have been necessary otherwise. With the eventual prey phenotypic con- stitution and random dispersal, expected predator survival would have been only about 25% (based on mean survival on monocultures of plant pheno- types). Predator selection of prey almost doubled predator survival to 48.9%, a result of lowered predator densities. Because the proportion of resistant genes in plants increased in the experimental system, the mean num- ber of plants surviving gradually increased from a low of about 40% to about 85% (Fig. 6).

Percentage of surviving plants in the control ( ) and experimental (------) population sys- tems at each generation. at equilibrium, a small percentage of the plants were totally consumed. Some continual selective pressure from the animal was necessary to maintain the genetically resistant makeup of the experimental plant population. In addition, the susceptible individuals provided more energy to the animal population than did the more resistant plants. Under conditions of equilibrium, the mean percentage of total energy (sap) removed from the plant population in the ex- perimental system was about 25%. At the same time, the control animal population was consuming about 78% from the control plant population. Thus, in the experimental system, the feeding pres- sure exerted by the animal on its plant population evolved from a point where surplus energy (interest) plus some essential energy (capital) was consumed to a point where feeding pressure of the animal was limited only to surplus energy. DISCUSSION In previous models, we have demonstrated that the genetic feedback mechanism alone is sufficient to control predator (parasite and herbivore) numbers feeding on prey or hosts, although it would rarely be expected to act alone in nature (Pimentel 1961, Levin 1972). This paper provides partial experi- mental verification of the predictions of these papers. The multilocus system provides a further complica- tion of the earlier scheme, but the system seems robust with respect to such complication. The results of the biological experiments demon- strated, as did the mathematical model, that predator (parasite and herbivore) population feeding may be restricted and adjusted to surplus energy of the prey or host population via the genetic feedback mecha- nism. Predator population feeding was adjusted so that it was removing less than the total amount of energy available from the prey population. The result was a well-balanced supply-demand economy between predator and prey and general stability in the predator-prey system as a whole. As in the earlier single-locus mathematical models, the genetic balance depended critically on the superiority of intermediate phenotypes. The dominant population control mechanisms in these experimental systems evolved from one of intra- specific competition initially to genetic feedback later on. It would be difficult to measure the exact amount of competition operative in the experimental systems at equilibrium; however, we estimate that such com- petition would account for only a small fraction of the mortality in the animal population, based on the observed exponential growth in the control pop- ulation at densities of &lt; 100.
