<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. A. Pugacenkova, Iskusstvo Turkmenistana - Ocerk s drevnejsih vremen do 1917 g. (The art of Turkmenistan - Features from the earliest times down to the year 1917). (Moscow, 1967, ? Iskusstvo? Publ. House, 328 pp., nume? rous illustrations, plans, etc. in the text, 158 illustrated plates). The book we are reviewing ? with a tardiness for which we beg the reader's indulgence ? is one fit for study not only by specialists in Asian art but by all those who feel that art is an indivisible unity whether we think of the many genres in which it is embodied or its extension in space and time. Ben Jonson rightly observed that ?Art hath an enemy called ignorance?; and one of the reasons for, and consequences of this is that in surveying the great traditional areas of the ? history of art ? (especially when this is treated as an academic subject), our gaze has been geographically confined; whereas today new realms of art are being revealed alike to the historiographer of universal art and to the amateur tout court. And now a book by Mrs Pugacenkova Masson provides incontestable and documented proof that one of these terrae novae is Soviet Turkmenistan. In her preface, which abounds in interesting points of view and aperqus, the authoress, to be sure, does not err when she affirms that ? at present we are living in a highly significant period: for while limits imposed by national diffe? rences are gradually being abolished, we can observe the flowing together of many individual cultures within a single international river-bed ?. Mrs Pugacenkova does not fail to stress the dyna? mic and dialectical nature of this process. While on the one hand we are beginning to discern ? a general and synthetic feature in the artistic culture of the peoples of Central Asia considered in its entirety ?, a prerequisite of such an overall vision must be the careful study of all those ? particular trends that in their long history have served to mould the peculiarities of centuries-old national cultures?. The methodology that the authoress coherently applies throughout her whole expo? sition is an organic blend of the analytical and synthetic approach; and her attention now shifts accordingly from the world-wide, or at anyrate Euroasiatic, artistic heritage to the particular contributions of individual Central Asian peoples,</page><page sequence="2">A short Essai historique sur Van du Turkme? nistan, appended in French by the authoress, aims to provide the reader untutored in Russian with a summary idea of the book's rich and intricate contents. Yet despite Mrs Pugacenkova's evident good intentions in compiling this brief and condensed resume, it seems to us but a pale shadow of the great historico-artistic world that looms up in the two hundred and odd pages of the Russian text. Clearly, the many and always instructive considerations of a methodological, stylistic and comparative nature, etc. that make the reading of the Russian text such a true in? tellectual pleasure not only for the specialist but for every lover of art and the science of art could not be accommodated in this skeletal resume in French. On the other hand, the latter will prove of greater use to anyone aiming to treat this volume largely as a historico-artistic Bilderbuch; indeed, it contains exact references to the very numerous and well-chosen illustrations. To the person in the habit of perusing Soviet historico artistic publications, these will not always prove to be new and unpublished material, though some of them are bound to excite a sense of wonder and admiration in anyone approaching this ? new ? field of Asian art, rich beyond all surmise, for the first time. Still less than the authoress can your reviewer hope, in the restricted space available to him, to give an adequate idea of the contents of this remarkable book which undoubtedly deserves the attention of ? western ? publishers and translators. We shall confine ourselves, then, to a few remarks about the main subjects dealt with therein: these are mainly related to architecture, pottery, the figurative and applied arts, etc.; and they comprise a product of the artistic activity of Turkmenians from earliest times: the weaving of artistic carpets famous the world over. As regards the span of time under review, it covers several millennia stretching from late Neolithic and Chalcolithic (about 5,000 years before our era) to the eve of the October Revolution. The task the authoress has taken on is no easy one: she has had to discern and consistently follow Ariadne's thread through this labyrinth of centuries and the artistic material accumulating therein! There is no need to point out that the only way of tracing this connecting thread is through a typological comparison between the artifacts discovered in the area in question and archaeological-artistic finds in surrounding areas: the leitfossil is, as always, pottery. The archaic ceramic art of southern Turkmenistan belongs to that ?world of painted pottery? so splendidly represented by the oldest proto-historical and historical civilisations of Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau, but not without the appearance of unmistakable local variations. Glancing at th* characteristic illustrations that are made use of (cf. plates 1-2 in particular) we must agree with Mrs Pugacenkova when she declares: ?The an? cient pottery of southern Turkmenistan is so expressive and rich in its ornamentation as to provide almost visual evidence of the main stages in chronology, and to serve as a guide to the direction in which whole archaeological cultures were tending in their process of formation and development ?. We have no hesitation in deeming the pages the authoress devotes to neolithic and chalcolithic pottery and to the symbolism of ornament as among the most interesting in the book: they are evidence of a fine sensibility at work, even with regard to that ?pre-logical? mentality (to avoid the term ?magical?) that is betrayed in this archaic, geometrical and zoomorphic ornament. It is not mere decoration but something much more vital; for it is one of the primordial forms of artistic expression as such; it is the embodi? ment of a state of mind that the authoress inter? prets as follows: ? In the imagination of these early men of the neolithic and chalcolithic age ... geometrical signs serve as an expression of the great forces of nature. They themselves ... are perceived as an incarnation of particles of these forces which, thanks to the sign born of the imagination of man, are no longer hostile but favourable towards him?. In that part of her exposition concerned with prehistoric art, Prof. Pugacenkova is never tired of heeding the semantic language of these orna? mental designs throughout the various stages of their evolution beginning with the polychrome pottery in red and brown decorated with wavy bands and ? flakes ? belonging to ? Dzejtun cul? ture ? (that important neolithic site in southern Turmenistan that has even found its way into manuals of archaeology). In the chalcolithic period the ornamental repertoire becomes enriched with fresh geometrical designs: rhombuses, triangles and chequers, etc. One ornamental motif which is a hallmark of south Turkmenistan pottery is the figure of the cross; it was not originally a ceramic motif but one borrowed from the techni? que of trellis-work and weaving mats, fabrics and so on ? one of the oldest techniques of mankind. It is a motif that recurs abundantly in the presentday Turkmenian carpet. By and large the ethnographic picture of the Turkmenian area, especially where weaving is concerned, reveals significant points of contact with early civilisation and the geometrical ornamentation which was its predominant feature. The authoress shows an unflagging interest in such survivals or the re 165</page><page sequence="3">emergence of elements of the ancestral heritage of these populations (without wishing, obviously, to lay down an unthinkable ethnic continuity between recent populations and prehistoric inha? bitants of the area in question). Many pages and illustrations in the present work are devoted to animal style ornamentation in the chalcolithic pottery of this area. The animal that early potters clearly pre area. The animal that early potters clearly pre? ferred as a motif was the wild goat. In using it for decorative purposes they concentrated on its essential features (long curved horns, etc.). There is no need to recall here that a number of eminent explorers (B.A. Litvinskij, K. Jettmar, G. Tucci) of the mythico-religious world of High Asia have found evidence that a ? goat complex? in the full sense once prevailed in these regions. Besides the wild goat, ornamental designs also reveal the silhouettes of stylised birds and quadru? peds including a kind of ?panther?. This Russian scholar also holds that the semantics of this zoomorphic representation is linked to tote mis tic concepts, and to be exact ? with the final phases in the transformation of the latter, when they become an ethnographic tradition ?. Though acknowledging the original magico-mythological role of these symbols, the authoress rightly per? ceives that in them there are already the rudi? ments of the aesthetic emancipation of the deco? rative and ornamental motif from its magical sub? stratum. It is the profane, folk art of Turkme? nistan peoples, their paintings, work of embroi? dery and intaglio and very original toys that are linked to these archaic origins. ?The spirit of the folk-tale, of legend and the apologue per? meates these panthers, these goats, these bustards whose outlines are full of a delicate feeling for form and rhythm ?. The writer of the present review of this fine work finds it no easy task to tear himself away from the many pages that this history of art de? votes to the products of potters separated from us by almost six millennia. The life of these men, anything but ? primitive ? in the pejorative sense of this adjective, is seen in the minds eye even in the passages in which the authoress describes the birth of architecture in southern Turkmenistan beginning with the neolithic conglomeration rising from the fertile soil of the aforementioned site of Dzejtun ? one minutely explored by Soviet archaeologists. The plans she reproduces and the detailed analysis of this complex that she carries out convince us that we are confronted with a first approach towards urban architecture which was later to reveal a fresh impetus in the chalco? lithic period of Geoksjur, Kara-tepe, Jassy-tepe, Anau I, etc. In the architecture of chalcolithic sites funerary constructions acquire growing im? portance: they belong to the most powerful members of the clan. The articulation of a class system is already in being. The Bronze Age in our area (3rd - 2nd millen? nium) is marked by the rise of an authentic proto-urban civilisation with large complexes of residential quarters (one of the patriarchal houses of Namazga-tepe comprises no less than thirty rooms), artisan quarters, public squares and roads. The best known sites are Namazga-tepe, Akyn tepe and Jassy-tepe, and there are others besides. Among these, Namazga-tepe reveals as many as six stratigraphical horizons that are an archaeolog? ical key to the typology and chronology of the cultures of south Turkmenistan from Chalcolithic down to the various phases of the Bronze Age. It is superfluous to point out that Mrs Pugacenkova everywhere supplies detailed technical data about the architecture of these constructions, the material used and the arrangement of rooms, etc. In addition to ornament, it is on the art of modelling in the prehistoric age that the authoress concentrates her loving interest. As in other areas of the ? primitive? world we first come across small female idols bound up with the cult of fertility and personified by figures of mother earth, etc. Male figures are rarer, and they, too, no doubt are replete with magico-religious meaning. These anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes in terracotta are stylised to the maximum, but more realistic ones have also been found (at Kara-tepe, 3rd millennium) calling to mind the anatomical features of the female body. The first half of the first millennium B.C. represents an important turning point in the historico-social vicissitudes of ancient Turkme? nistan. ? For archaeologists this is the " Iron Age for sociologists the age of the decline of patriar? chal-tribal organisation accompanied by the ma? turing and development of the ties of serfdom ?. The most important event for our area was its subjugation under the empire of the Achaeme nians. It is in this period that fortified citadels arise (such as Jaz-tepe, El'ken-tepe and others), and subsequently towns of considerable size as well (Kalaly-gyr, Kjuzeli-gyr, etc.). This period in the artistic history of Turkmenistan is dealt with by the authoress with all due breadth and her usual devotion to technical detail ? qualities that are, alas, at odds with a brief review like the present one. In any case, this period and its architectural, artistic and urban culture has been illustrated by other specialists, too, including V.M. Masson junior, in a number of important publi? cations like Srednjaja Azija i drevnij vostok (Central Asia and the Ancient East), already 166</page><page sequence="4">known to our readers (cf. EW, XV, 1965, pp. 310-315). In reading this volume it is often evident that the authoress, as well as being an art historian, is also an architect by profession (already known to our readers as such from her collaboration in restoring an outstanding monument of Samarkand art, the Ishratkhana Mausoleum - cf. EW., XVI, 1966, pp. 336-338). What she has to say about the architectural and urban structure of cities in the Parthian Empire like Merv and Nisa etc., the devolopment of urbanization, of the building craft, and even of fortification complexes in these and other centres everywhere proclaims the person well-versed in the tricks of the trade and ?accustomed to blend practice and theory. Be that as it may, owing to the many plans and illustra? tions even those who are not experts in the art of planning and constructing buildings, cities and fortresses will acquire a fairly tangible idea of art and architecture in the kingdom of the Arsacids ? a dynasty so very open to the great religious and artistic tendencies of the age. The deep influence of Hellenic art is attested by many clear plates reproducing the now well-known sculptures disco? vered ? at Nisa abose all (cf. the very fine torso of a half-naked woman, from Nisa, pi. 18); but there is no lack, even, of iconographic evidence relating to Buddhist traditions (cf. the pathetic head of the Buddha of Merv, pi. 17), or of that coming from Palmyra (cf. the famous stele of Bajt, from Vekil'-Bazar, pi. 26 and the note apper? taining by M.E. Masson, Two Taimyrene Stelae from the Merv Oasis, in EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 239-247). The surprising series of ritual rhytons from Nisa, Dionysian in subject matter, is by now known through scores of publications that have reproduced them and commented upon them. The use of the horn for drinking and ritual libations is lost in the dim beginnings of history: Mrs Pugacenkova briefly traces its artistic history that culminates, it can be said, in this happy fusion of the Hellenistic and Asiatic spirit occurring at Nisa under the auspices of the Nysigena (but we must not forget that numerous localities with this name ranging from Thrace to the land of the Aethiopes and the Nisa of the Parthians, were looked upon as birthplaces of the god and ancient centres of his cult). But apart from these signi? ficant considerations of a historico-religious order, these ivory rhytons, ornamented with friezes and scenes from Greek mythology, are artistic master? pieces documenting the high level of art and artistic feeling in ancient Parthia. The series of Parthian seals (pi. 51) is also very varied, some of them bearing Zoroastrian emblems ? another proof of that cultural and religious syncretism that makes the Arsacid period such a fascinating but also such a complex one for the historian. Besides this ?high? syncretistic culture, the authoress does not neglect the enduring cult and unceasing portrayal of popular autochthonous divinities attested by the many terracotta sta? tuettes that have come to light in the oases of Merv and Chorasmia (pis. 52-64). These tiny and mainly female idols, though linked typologically with the modelling art of the prehistorical period, are not wholly immune from the great artistic tendencies peculiar to their age, that of Greek inspiration on the one hand, and of ? steppe art ? on the other. In this latter connexion considerable interest is aroused by the group of male figurines from Merv (pis. 68-76): bearded warriors, some? times on horseback, tiny and extremely stylised idols, etc. Quite rightly, the authoress associates this type with the environment of the central Asiatic steppes ? the original homeland of the Parthians ? which gains revenge, as it were, on the non-autochthonous tendencies influenced by the more imposing high culture of the oikumene of settled populations belonging to the world at that time. The predilection of our authoress and archi? tect for castles, palaces and cult buildings leads her everywhere to employ great technical ability in describing them. Christian churches and mo? nasteries are not lacking from this vast context (at Merv and in its oasis, for instance - cf. the plans in the text, pp. 87-88), but we also find ourselves confronted with Mazdaic monuments and, above all, by those ossuaries that are repre? sentative of Mazdaism in Central Asia (those reproduced in plates 65-66, from Merv, are very interesting and artistic). Monumental paintings like those of the 6th - 7th century found in other areas of Central Asia have not yet been found in Turkmenistan; but the large painted vase from Merv (pi. 67), its motifs perhaps taken from Greek and Iranian epic themes, leads one to infer that painting also was not absent from our area during the periods of its artistic productivity. After the Arab conquest and in the wake of feudal development, urban and religious archi? tecture gains a fresh impetus, and in the last part of her work Mrs Pugacenkova is really in her element amidst countless mosques, medreses, mausoleums, caravansaries, and so on, which make this area an eldorado for those also pursuing the history of Islamic art. As always, this scholar seeks to trace the line of development of this art in Turkmenistan, distinguishing three trends: those associated with Khorassan, Khorezm and the regions of the Caspian Sea, each of which is illustrated in the book by drawings and plates. We have already mentioned the great interest 167</page><page sequence="5">shown by the authoress in the Turkmenian carpet and its history and in the prolific folk art of this area in general. Its many ornamental motifs, especially those still used in carpets, go back according to Mrs Pugacenkova, to those found in painted pottery of the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages. This is a somewhat bold yet stimulating thesis as is the whole content of this book even where the views embodied are debatable. We would not wish to close this ? unhappily inadequate ? review without referring to a very useful boon this work offers especially for those who professionally, or out of personal interest, are given over to the study of that now vast mass of Soviet specialised literature dealing with the art and culture of Central Asia. This is a small glossary of ? a number of Central Asiatic terms met with in the text referring to archi? tecture and art? that, alas, occupies but a single page (p. 205) where several more could have been filled. These terms, indeed, are largely local and mainly Turkic ones and would be sought after in vain in the usual dictionaries of the Russian language. They include items like pahsa ? beaten clay?, ganc a ? Central Asiatic variety of gypsum?, and others that have now become household words in Soviet publications devoted to Central Asia.
