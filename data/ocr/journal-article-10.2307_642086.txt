<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREECE AND ROME VOL. XVI, NO. 48 OCTOBER 1947 SOME METHODS OF RESEARCH INTO THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES By JACQUELINE CHITTENDEN T HERE are flaws in the usual methods of research into religious origins which have become apparent to the writer during several years' work on the cult of one Greek god. It has therefore seemed desirable to restate and to examine these methods so as to demonstrate the merits and the faults of each. To do so is one aim of this paper; another is an elucidation of the many important advantages of the his- torical approach, and, although it is hoped that the principles herein erected as guides to study are applicable to all ancient gods, the illustra- tions of these principles will derive very largely from Hermes, the god with whose cult and concept the writer has been most closely concerned. It would be hard to exaggerate the difficulties which beset a student when he turns to the problem of an ancient god's origin. Even a partial solution demands his utmost caution, for the easy explanation is hardly ever the right one. He must guard himself against the beguilements of the attractive theory which will very often beckon him down the wrong path. To avoid this and to enter upon his task most wisely he will meditate upon two main initial difficulties. The first one to present itself is, of course, the fact that the origin of most gods worshipped by the Greeks lies in the past far behind Homer. Therefore the student is faced with an almost total lack of literary and epigraphical material-at least which he can understand- to aid him in the search. A long period of the god's history remains unrecorded for him except, perhaps, in archaeological monuments which in any event he must interpret cautiously. The second difficulty consists in a definition. How would one define what one meant by 'the origin of a god'? What does it connote, and what elements does it include? The problem becomes clearer if, when it is stated, it is arbi- trarily divided. The student must endeavour to discover (I) the origin of a god's name, if possible, its original significance as well as its etymo- logical character; (2) the original character, function, and power of the god as envisaged by his worshippers; (3) the outward form originally 3871*48 H</page><page sequence="2">98 SOME METHODS OF RESEARCH INTO assumed by the god; (4) the time, place, and people responsible for the creation of the idea. Let it be repeated that this fourfold division is an arbitrary one, made only for purposes of clarity. Each of the four parts is not a separate problem; they are all in some way connected and interdependent. For example, the original character, function, and power of a divinity are related to the form he originally takes, provided, of course, that the latter is thought to embody the god and is not a mere attribute. The sight of a ritual agalma evokes in its worshipper certain ideas which he has of its character. Of course, a very primitive worshipper may consider the object itself to be sentient or semi-sentient; a distinct advance is made when he associates his ideas of the function and power of an agalma with a spirit which he believes to be immanent in it.' There is a similar relationship between parts I and 4 of the problem, inasmuch as a discovery of the etymology of a god's name will tell us something about the identity of the people who may first have envisaged the idea. Philology is the method which helps us here, and although we must join with Farnell2 in rebuking the over-enthusiastic philologists of the last century, their science can help the student very much indeed, provided that he does not attach too expansive a scope to the con- clusions to which it brings him. They are valuable clues and must be regarded simply as such. But let us consider what philology can do. The origin of some gods with a pre-Greek folk is occasionally revealed by their names, which are not Greek and which bear at best only a superficial relationship with that language. For example, Athena's name betrays her. The philo- logist can demonstrate that it is non-Greek, which means that it belongs to the tongue of another people.3 Therefore, we can with some confi- dence infer that the early concept of this goddess was known to the people who gave her her name. Moreover, when methods of study other than philology are applied to her cult it emerges that the name of Athena is not the only non-Greek thing about her. The careful anthropologist can detect features in her cult which are clear survivals of concepts belonging to a primitive society; the archaeologist and the historian can show that these features derive from the religious customs and concepts of the Minoans, who were a non-Greek people.4 The contribution of philology to the study of Hermes is partly illu- minating and partly confusing. The most satisfactory explanation of his I See Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, i, p. 4 f. 2 Ibid., pp. 2 ff. 3 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion, pp. 418 ff. 4 Ibid., pp. 420 ff.</page><page sequence="3">THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES 99 name, first advanced by Preller,' is that it derives from the Greek word Eppa, and this derivation suits all dialectical variants of his name. Almost certain is the interpretation of it as 'he of the stone heap'.2 Here the science of philology has contributed an answer of considerable significance because it affects the question of the god's original form. Hermes' most primitive image was in fact a heap of stones, and his name accords so well with this early feature of his cult as to be descrip- tive of it. Nevertheless, this answer brings some perplexity in its wake. Eppac is a Greek work and philology might therefore be said to proclaim Hermes to be a Greek god; but if we were to accept this conclusion as final, we should be wilfully ignoring a great mass of evidence of other kinds which points to an entirely different conclusion, namely, that the idea and worship of the god whom the Greeks called Hermes originated with a non-Greek people. And so in one respect philology has served further to obscure rather than to clarify the problem of this particular god. Yet the writer comes not so close to despair as does Farnell, who sees an almost insuperable barrier in the puzzling etymology of Hermes' name. It is not unprecedented in the long history of religion for a god's name to be changed.3 Mythological evidence, if used with caution, can be an auxiliary of some merit to the sciences of philology and anthropology, for it some- times gives interesting information about the fourth part of our problem. Legends which tell of conflicts between one divinity and another reflect racial collisions. These conflicts terminate either in a compromise or in the almost total overthrow of one god by the other; therefore they engender a reasonable suspicion that one of the parties concerned stands for the people, heroes, and divine concepts of a population conquered by invaders. The pre-Greek Hyakinthos yielded to Apollo, just as Kronos did to Zeus; still it is not always the older god who is vanquished: witness Poseidon's defeat at the hands of Athena. The most famous quarrel of this kind in which Hermes took part involved him with Apollo, a god of a people who not only invaded Greece but also came from the north. More obscure is Hermes' dispute at Tanagra with Ares, another northern invader.4 Hermes was completely victorious on this occasion, but a third legend seems to mirror the overthrow of his cult in one locality. This tale relates the hostile behaviour of Aipytos to I Griechische Mythologie, i. I, p. 385 f., note 5. 2 My forthcoming article in Hesperia, 1947 gives another interpretation. 3 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 4. 4 Pausanias ix. 22. 2; Corinna, frg. i ; cf. J. M.

Aipytos was an Arcadian hero--either he or his kinsman of the same name was buried on Hermes' most holy mountain, Kyllene, in northern Arcadia, and the name Aipytos was Hermes' cult title in the very town of Tegea.' When we turn to Poseidon we find the claim that he was the first Greek god to enter the peninsula to be well founded. Aipytos' opposition to him ended in the hero's own disaster; the cult of Hermes Aipytos remained localized at Tegea and was of limited significance even there. Students of Greek religious origins have frequently turned to the science of anthropology for help. Farnell's eulogy of this method must certainly be accepted and, with some reservations, his analysis of its claims. He asserts that it promises, not miracles, but aid within a small sphere of the inquiry. A just criticism would be that his analysis depends for accuracy upon the person who uses the method. If the student employs it imprudently he may be captivated by the beguilements mentioned above. Farnell himself and Nilsson, both cautious scholars, have applied anthropology with great skill and usually with convincing results, but there have been others who have abused it as seriously as nineteenth-century philologists abused the evidence of mythology. On account of an unwavering faith in anthropology and an unwillingness to check its results by other methods, scholars have in the past been lured into varying degrees of error regarding their conclusions on the original power and function of Hermes. It is of the utmost importance for the student to govern his application of this method, and this is one of the functions of the historical approach. The science of anthropology provides us with invaluable information about the customs, taboos, habits, activities, and livelihoods of people in various grades of society ranging from the most primitive to the most complex. It also shows (I) that certain features in primitive religion are fairly constant throughout the world, and (2) that these primitive features, particularly those of ritual, tend to outlive the society from which they sprang and to survive into advanced social stages. Therefore anthropology and its attendant study, comparative religion, has con- siderable value, but its statements must be viewed simply as instruments for interpretation, not as doctrines delivered ex cathedra. Only in this way will a student show caution and common sense if he applies the science to Greek religious origins. If a primitive characteristic is reported of a cult by a late source, literary or archaeological, it is dangerous to leap to the conclusion that the characteristic is the original one from which all others derive unless one finds evidence of earlier periods to support Iliad ii. 603 f.; Pausanias viii. 17. I; 47- 4.</page><page sequence="5">THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES ioi it. Serious mistakes can result from a failure of the historical sense. It is true that primitive aspects of religion survive, but it is equally true that these aspects may pass from one cult to another by an accidental association or juxtaposition. In some cases it is difficult to decide whether the process of survival or of transference has been at work, but if one's problem concerns religious origins, a wise rule of thumb is to value early sources and to study the background of the cult in early periods. Some illustration of the merits and faults of this method should be given. It has been demonstrated that mythology can provide hints about the identity of a people responsible for the creation of a divine idea. Anthropology can do the same. It has particular merit for the study of ritual, inasmuch as it enables the religious researcher to dis- tinguish primitive elements from later accretions. Certain features of ritual and cult observance provide him with information similar to that given by mythology and, in the case of both Kronos and Hermes, act as supporting testimony to mythology. For example, during Greek festivals of Kronos, slaves were given privileges which, in Crete, they also enjoyed throughout the Hermaia.' Anthropology draws attention to other Mediterranean ritual which is analogous, and the best explana- tion of the phenomenon is that the slaves represent a conquered popula- tion who regain their lost liberty during the festival of their own gods. A parallel to these festivals is to be found in customs prevailing in Samos. According to Plutarch,2 open theft was condoned there during the festival of Hermes Charidotes. Certainly Hermes' own thievishness, attested as early as Homer, is best explained if he was the god of a con- quered population whose members, usually oppressed, boggled not at robbing or cheating their oppressors. The case of 'Taffy' is not dis- similar. Still, the historically-minded student will not suffer this to be called conclusive proof of the pre-Hellenic origin either of Kronos or of Hermes. First, the evidence does not derive from early sources; secondly, its character is negative, not positive. The anthropological method is used most frequently for the second and third sections of our inquiry: the divinity's original form, and his original character, function, and power. Here flaws of reasoning can emerge from the wrong application of anthropology and likewise from a rooted objection to setting a historical check upon the inferences which are drawn from it. In many cases these inferences are partially justified, but when they are advanced as satisfactory and conclusive answers, they prove to be, for the reader at least, quite the reverse. So I Macrobius, Sat. i. IO. 22, who cites Philochorus and quotes Accius (i. 7. 37); for the Hermaia cf. Athenaeus xiv. 639 B. 2 Quaestiones Graecae, 55.</page><page sequence="6">o02 SOME METHODS OF RESEARCH INTO general an approach as 'Anthropology shows this to be a primitive feature of a god's cult and so it is probably the original feature' is indecisive and unsatisfactory, although possibly true. Original with whom, where, and at what time is one's query. If the reply were to be: among the races living in the Aegean area during the second or third millennia B.C., it is necessary to try to find out whether there is any evidence for the existence of such a feature among the religious ideas of these people living then in that place. Furthermore, there are instances of a flagrant abuse of the anthropo- logical method resulting in inaccurate statements. Scherer, in his article on Hermes,I on the one hand claims him as a Wind God in origin, on the other states his earliest form to be a phallus. There are many things wrong with this, quite apart from the extraordinarily wrong con- junction of Hermes with the wind. Assuming, however, that the associa- tion has some justification, which it has not, we may well ask what proof there is that the Greeks represented the wind as phallic. In the second place, Hermes was portrayed as a simple phallus only at Kyllene in Elis, and records of this cult are all late.2 It is, of course, true that anthropology proclaims such emblems to belong to a primitive stage of religious development, but it does not, on the other hand, gainsay the existence of a process by which the features of one cult pass to another, even if the features are primitive. And a single example of a primitive aspect reported by late authors will not suffice to justify so broad a statement as: 'Die ilteste Form bildlicher Darstellung, unter welcher der Gott Verehrung fand, war der Phallos, das charakteristische Abzeichen des Hermes in seiner Eigenschaft als zeugungskraiftiger und fruchtbarer Gott.'3 Indeed, almost every scholar who has written on Hermes has overlooked the fact that his phallic or fertility character is not properly attested in the early period of Greek history, a time when we should logically expect to find the clearest evidence of it if the presumption of his phallic origin were correct. But there is another and more serious error implicit in Scherer's statement, which is due perhaps to faulty phraseology. He means, I think, that an original portrayal by means of I Roscher's Lexikon der griechischen und r6mischen Mythologie, i, pp. 2342 ff. 2 Pausanias, vi. 26. 5; Hippol. Ref. Haer. v. 8; Artemid. Oneirokr. i. 45; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. vi. 20; Lucian, Zeus Trag. 42. There is no evidence that the huge agalma on Mt. Kyllene was a phallus, though numerous scholars have hastily assumed it from the sources just cited, where the authors refer only to the Elean cult; cf. A. B. Cook, Zeus, iii, p. 725, footnote 5; Pieske, RE. xi. 2, col. 2456; Preller, Griechische Mythologie, i. I, p. 388; Nilsson, Griechische Feste, p. 391, footnote (o); Immerwahr, Die Kulte und Mythen Arkadiens, pp. 76 ff. 3 Scherer, op. cit., 2391 f.</page><page sequence="7">THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES 1o3 a phallus is to be inferred for Hermes on anthropological grounds, and his opinion therefore is similar to that of Professor Murray, who infers a 'phallic stone post'.' On the other hand, if Scherer's words are taken literally he has made a historical error, because the oldest recorded cult monument of Hermes was certainly not a simple phallus nor even an ithyphallic terminal figure, but a heap of stones mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey.z In fact, the phallic aspect of the god did not emerge in either art or literature until the sixth century had advanced several decades. Moving backward into the Bronze Age we find the god who is clearly Hermes' prototype3 also represented by heaps of stones or also portrayed anthropomorphically. Sometimes illogicalities result from overlooking the connexion between the form and the character of a god. It has already been pointed out that the sight of an agalma suggests to a worshipper certain ideas of the character of the deity with whom he associates it. The relationship between form and function is logically very close, yet scholars have sometimes failed to observe it. Eitrem, for example, states that Hermes' earliest form was a heap of stones and elsewhere argues that his most primitive function concerned fertility.4 Before one accepts both these surmises as true, it is reasonable to inquire whether a stone heap, as such, ever definitely conveyed an idea of fertility to the Greeks of historical times. An examination of evidence of all kinds and from all periods reveals that such heaps conveyed several ideas to the Greeks, but not specific- ally that one, so the antecedent likelihood that their predecessors had the idea clearly formulated in their minds is considerably diminished. But here the question of stone-throwing is raised. In the Troizenian cult of Auxesia and Damia ceremonial stone-throwing is clearly fertility ritual,s but there is no evidence to prove that the custom of throwing a stone on Hermes' wayside heaps was also a fertility rite. Xanthus' explanation takes the form of an aetiological legend, but the reason given by him is quite different from that which underlies the Lithobolia at Troizen.6 If, in order to find an explanation of the custom in Hermes' case, one enters the storehouse provided by anthropology and compara- tive religion, one will find it well stocked with instances of stone-throw- ing, the motives for which are numerous and varied.7 In early historical I Five Stages of Greek Religion, p. 76 f. 2 Odyssey xvi. 471 f. 3 See my forthcoming article in Hesperia, 1947. 4 RE. viii.

Frazer, The Golden Bough, ix, pp. 8 ff.</page><page sequence="8">104 SOME METHODS OF RESEARCH INTO times the two motives of appeal for protection on the one hand and of reverence for the dead on the other may have impelled the passer-by to add a stone to Hermes' heap, but the first of these motives is probably the earlier of the two, the second operating only after Hermes became the Leader of Souls to the underworld. Be all this as it may, in time the casual traveller seems to have observed the custom automatically, that is, he threw his stone on the heap, forced by no conscious thought but by habit. It is significant that the explanatory tale related by Xanthus appears to have been invented by him, which fact suggests that as early as the fifth century the original motive had been forgotten. The views that Hermes' original character, function, and power were chthonian, phallic, or both have been widely held for a long time. The present writer, in rejecting them all, is in the lonely position of an apostate. The ultimate cause for dissent has been a strict regard for historical sequence; the conclusions that Hermes was originally a fertility god or one with chthonian associations are simple inferences based on anthropology, in spite of the fact that these features are not emphasized at any time in the god's history, nor are they clearly visible in the early historical age. The latter fact is significant. Let me elucidate: at any period one may choose to examine, Hermes' chief connexion with the underworld was that of Leader of Souls. His position in Hades was a subordinate one; here and there at more advanced periods one finds traces of a vague belief in his chthonian power, but these are clearly opinions of individuals. The belief is not frequently expressed, nor does it even include the idea of his being Supreme Lord of the Shades and the underworld. The Hermes whom Orestes invokes owes his power to Zeus, according to Aeschylus. In the fifth century and later, Hermes appears as one power of the underworld, but not the most important. Farnellz has observed this and therefore, although he tends to favour the interpretation usually advanced, his pronouncement is hesitant. Never- theless, Hermes appears only once in Homer as Leader of Souls, and it should be pointed out that he does not carry out this benevolent function in the Iliad, an epic which describes the deaths of many warriors and the departure of their souls to the underworld. They flit miserably to Hades under no guidance but their own, and so it is clear that two beliefs about the way by which the souls of the dead reached Hades were current in the ninth century, when we can assume that Homer was writing. The view just mentioned is expressed far more frequently than the other, and I am of the opinion that it is the older of the two. Hermes became the Leader of Souls because he was the Guide to the Living; Choephoroi, I ff. 2 CGS. v, pp. II ff.</page><page sequence="9">THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES 105 this expansion of his earlier function was stimulated by a change of burial customs at the end of the Bronze Age. The invading Greeks introduced cremation and a form of burial consisting in the heaping up of a mound which was surmounted by a stele. Such graves were similar in appear- ance to the heaps sacred to Hermes. Moving away from Homer and the Geometric Age, we find in the period which follows several literary references to Hermes and archaeological monuments as well, but the chthonian aspect of the god is not stressed. The long Homeric hymn to Hermes, composed towards the end of the seventh century, might almost be called the first monograph on the god. In it his concern with the under- world is barely mentioned. There is a laconic reference of less than two lines' to Hermes' role of Guide to Hades, and Hesiod says nothing at all. More conspicuous by a completer absence from the art and litera- ture of early periods is Hermes' so-called phallic aspect. Not only Homer is silent about this, but Hesiod and the hymn-writer as well. Representations of the god by means of an ithyphallic terminal figure do not begin until the sixth century, and Miss Goldman's suggestionz that this conventional image originated with the cult of Dionysus, whence it was transferred to that of Hermes, seems to me indisputable. The phallus was never so important to the cult and ritual of Hermes as it was to Dionysus and other vegetative deities. Hermes is not one of this group, having almost nothing to do with the fertility of the earth. His concern with human livelihoods was predominantly pastoral, not agri- cultural. In the pastoral scheme of things he operated as protector of sheep and goats, and this function of protection is paramount, but he was also empowered to increase the flocks.3 The transference of the phallic symbol to his cult image was therefore both easy and reasonable. More- over, his more primitive images, which were clearly heaps of stones sur- mounted by a larger stone,4 were in the very part of the country where the cults of the vegetative deities were to be found, although they also occurred very frequently in barren stretches such as rocky hill-sides and mountain-tops where the land was chiefly suitable for pasture. The ancient Greek peasant often combined the nurture of flocks with the cultivation of the soil, just as farmers do nowadays. Hesiod provides us with a good example: there is evidence of his pursuit of both livelihoods in the Works and Days and the opening lines of the Theogony. In the last paragraphs I have implied some of the functions of the historical approach. It maintains a sharp surveillance over the use of ' 572 f. 2 AJA., 1942, PP. 58 ff. 3 See Iliad xiv. 490; Theogony 444. 4 See my forthcoming article in Hesperia, 1947.</page><page sequence="10">io6 SOME METHODS OF RESEARCH INTO other methods and restrains the student from making rash inferences about religious origins from sources whose value for him is lessened by reason of the fact that they derive from late periods. Secondly, I have pointed out the need to examine the economic and social features of the early historical period as well as the visible characteristics of the deity within and with relation to that period. To be even more precise: the evidence of Homer should not be ignored; his information about reli- gious usages has been almost contemptuously pushed aside by religious researchers hitherto. Their battle-cry is: 'It is dangerous to argue from Homer's silence.' The answering challenge must be: 'Yes, but it is just as dangerous to ignore him altogether.' The sensible historian, searching for the origin of a god, will appraise him carefully at the time of his first clear and undoubted appearance. if Homer has anything to say, the historian will make an exhaustive examination of the poet, not treat his earliest authority as a Christmas pie into which he can stick his thumb and pull out a convenient plum of a passage to support a theory. Homer can be of considerable help, especially if one views him in relation to ninth-century Ionia, and is mindful that his epics are filled with Mycenaean reminiscences. There- fore it is wise, in the first place, to find out all one can about the Homeric view of the god; in the second place, to study Homeric society; in the third place, to consider the god's relationship with and importance for the characteristics of that society. In an earlier paragraph an attempt was made to define the phrase 'the origin of a god' and, by making an arbitrary classification of the elements implicit in the phrase, to simplify for the student one of his difficulties. How can Homer be of help here ? He tells us a good deal about many of the gods, but let us take Hermes as an example. What about Hermes' name ? It occurs in more than one dialectical form quite frequently, but what strikes the student most forcibly is the fact that the god is almost as frequently referred to by two epithets as by the name which is most familiar to us. Indeed, these two epithets, Diaktoros and Argeiphontes, singly or together, are alternative names for him. Secondly, we discover that he has a number of activities and functions, but that one function is stressed above all the others and that his main characteristic in the performance of it is protectiveness and help, which characteristic is so definitely his own that he possesses an epithet which is descriptive of it and which no other god possesses. This epithet is Eriounios and it, too, acts in Homer as an alternative name for Hermes. Thirdly, we learn that, in form, Hermes is usually anthropomorphic, but that he was also thought by ninth-century Ionians to be immanent in a heap of stones. He is also</page><page sequence="11">THE ORIGIN OF GREEK DEITIES 1o7 compared with a bird on one occasion. These and many other details cause one to infer much with respect to the time, place, and people of his origin, but other evidence must be examined before one can be reasonably sure.' One will decrease one's margin of error if, in addition to Homer, one carefully examines slightly later poets, such as Hesiod and the hymn- writers. The artistic material, too, should be consulted and studied for evidence, not only about the god but also for his connexion with prevail- ing beliefs and social and economic activities. This slightly later litera- ture and art bear out Homer's testimony in Hermes' case, and they also complete the picture which he has drawn of the god. To the present writer the value of this early picture for the researcher is both enormous and obvious; to discover the picture is one function of the historical approach. Yet the picture has rarely been sought which, in my opinion, accounts for the blurred focusing upon the period which is pre-Homeric. The historical method will dictate still other policies to the student. Homer and the Ionians of the ninth century were descendants of Mycenaean refugees who crossed the Aegean to escape the Dorians, and the early epics retain many Mycenaean elements. In particular the Iliad looks back on the late Bronze Age frequently to mirror it, as archaeological remains of the earlier period indicate. It is wise, therefore, to study with care the social, political, and economic features of the Greek Bronze Age so far as we can ascertain them through archaeology without a literature. Next, the religion of the Bronze Age should be studied. Much work has been done on the Minoan-Mycenaean religion in general by Sir Arthur Evans, Drs. M. P. Nilsson and A. W. Persson, who have scrutinized the numerous monuments of this early period in order to discover the prevailing religious customs as well as ideas of deity among the non- Greek Minoans, and the Mycenaeans whom they profoundly influenced. Finally, it has been demonstrated by these scholars that Minoan and Mycenaean religious features survive among the Greeks of a later time- even that some Greek deities are traceable to a Minoan prototype. Nilsson's analysis of Athena is masterly: he has shown that numerous characteristics in her personality and cult are Minoan survivals, and also that there is archaeological evidence for the cult of Athena or her proto- type in the Bronze Age. His method is sound, and one which ought to be applied by the student with respect to other deities. Being a study of survivals, it is clearly akin to the anthropological method. But, because its sphere is smaller, its answers are less vague, and if one unites the method with an examination of the early historical period, one should rarely be led into error.
