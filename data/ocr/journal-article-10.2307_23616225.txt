The key for understanding Schmitt's argument is in its corporeal social imaginary. What connects the theological structures of Christian ity with those of the contemporary social order is the corpus mysticum: the image of an embodied polis. The origin of the image is in scripture and it has been a subject of much theological speculation in the Christian tradition. The same image has a secular incarnation in the institution of the state, which is, of course, an omnipresent element in contemporary IR as well as in the everyday discourse of international relations. The article concludes with a thought on the role of political theology in the study of IR. Keywords: International Relations, political theology, symbolism, Carl Schmitt, Martin Luther INTRODUCTION The problem with most of us in the academic study of International Relations is that we choose not to see that the project we are involved in - a particular form of a cul tural tradition that we partake in by asking questions in the name of 'IR' and com ing up with educated answers too - serves a highly political purpose. We may like it or we may not, but in so doing, we can sincerely say that there is no escape from the fact that we are employed by an idol, an imaginary being of the unseen world, to legitimise a political hierarchy over human life. What am I talking about? (Or rather, who am I talking about?) The state, of course. If there is anything like an ontology in this project of ours, a fulcrum around which IR seems to turn, it is the polity of the state. We live in a world inhabited by states. I want to emphasise inhabited, because this is the image we have before us when we gaze at the world political: a society of 200 or so persons in a state of international society characterised by enmity or co-operation depending on which one of the fol lowing two thinkers you talk to: Thomas or Hugo. Perspectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="2">MIKA LUOMA-AHO What am I trying to say? Am I saying that the states of the world - like Britain, France, Germany, or, well, all of them really - are not real? This is an ontological question, one that you answer with a definition of 'real'. What states do not possess is a physical essence that would render their reality tangible for physical perception. Having said that states do have a capability to signify reality, there are people act ing in their name. We have them demarcated on maps, identified by flags, worn on sleeves and mobilised in green metal. But the state is no one in particular, not a pic ture, a flag, or a tank - all of these are symbols for something which cannot be seen, but we either believe it is there or are just ready to play along. Philosophically this is hardly a revelation: there is little novelty in the claim that the state is a question of collective belief. This has been the state of the art ever since IR opened shop. E. H. Carr writes in his The Twenty Years' Crisis that: it is difficult to see how orderly international relations can be conducted at all unless Englishmen, Frenchmen and Germans believe (however absurd the be lief may be) that 'Great Britain', 'France' and 'Germany' have moral duties to one another and a reputation to be enhanced by performing those duties. The spirit of international relations seems more likely to be improved by stimulating this belief than by decrying it. (Carr, 2001:139) Hans J. Morgenthau states the following in his Politics Among Nations: A nationlal state] as such is obviously not an empirical thing. A nation as such cannot be seen. What can be empirically observed are only the individuals who belong to a nation. [...] Therefore, when we speak in empirical terms of the power or of the foreign policy of a certain nation, we can only mean the power or the foreign policy of certain individuals who belong to the same nation. (Mor genthau, 1993:115) Ditto Kenneth N. Waltz in Man, State and War: In studying international politics it is convenient to think of states as the acting units. At the same time, it does violence to one's common sense to speak of the state, which is after all an abstraction and consequently inanimate, as acting (Waltz, 1954:175). And another contemporary neo-realist states more or less the same thing: Of course we 'realists' know that the state does not really exist. [...] Only indi viduals really exist, although I understand that certain schools of psychology Perspectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="3">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS challenge even this. Only individuals act, even though they may act on behalf of one of these collective social entities, the most important being the group. (Gilpin, 1984: 301) What we have today is, more or less, a world and a humanity divided into states, their territories and their populations. Even if this world expects us human beings to fill some of its logical gaps - like the one in which the state does not really exist - it does make perfect sense in its own sphere: that of international relations. Once you imag ine the state, believe in it or just play along, then world politics begins to make sense. What I am doing in this article is grounding our social imaginary of the state in Christian theology and - since doing just this is hardly difficult - also making these grounds relevant for the study of IR today. When we properly understand that the 'secular' concepts we use when doing IR have passed down to us from theology and see that the political purposes these concepts served in theology serve the same purposes in IR today, we have grounds for a radical re-thinking of the role and pur pose of our art. To get there we have to do two things. Firstly, we need to take Carl Schmitt's po litical theology seriously, which I will attempt to do in the following section. Sec ondly, we have to make an excursion into our social imaginary. On this excursion I will extract and analyse a peculiar form of symbolism - one that identifies in the image of a person the substance of political community - which has passed down from Christian theology to the modern theory of the state. What I am about to argue in this paper is not only that political theology is a going concern in the study of politics, but that it is especially important for IR. Bear with me as I lay out my claims. SCHMITTEAN POLITICAL THEOLOGY What do we mean by political theology? William T. Cavanaugh and Peter Scott put forward a general definition: 'analysis and criticism of political arrangements [...] from the perspective of differing interpretations of God's ways with the world' (Ca vanaugh and Scott, 2004: 3). Political theology has been a significant discourse es pecially in the context of Western Christianity, where most people identified or identifying themselves as political theologians are coming from1. Within the general framework there are different interpretations regarding the task of political theol ogy. Some see politics as a social 'sphere' with its own secular autonomy clearly dis tinct from the ecclesiastical sphere, and assign to political theology the task of holding the line between the two spheres. Others see theology as relating to mate rial society as a superstructure, and allot political theology to expose the ways in which theological discourse reproduces political and economic inequalities. Still others make no essential separation between the secular and the ecclesiastical Perspectives VoLl7,Na2 2009</page><page sequence="4">MIKA LUOMA-AHO sphere or between the social superstructure and the material base, but rather see theology and politics as similar activities: both produce metaphysical images around which communities are organised. I would argue that the political theology most relevant to IR is that of the last type. In this sense the topic has been explored in political theory, but it has unfortunately received very limited attention in IR theory. A notable exception is R. B. J. Walker, for whom the theory of international relations built on the doctrine of state sovereignty 'can be read as a very elegant specifically modern resolution of [...] philosophical problems that had once received a more theological treatment' (Walker, 1995: 320). According to Walker (ibid.: 314-315), IR is a theological dis course of'eternity' despite the extent to which it has been and is being framed in the secular terms of the Enlightenment. Another notable exception is Vendulka Kubalkova, who brings the study of IR and religion together with her notion of In ternational Political Theology OPT), which involves 'the systematic study of dis courses and relations amongst them concerning world affairs that search for - or claim to have found - a response, transcendental or secular, to the human need for meaning' (Kubalkova, 2000: 676-677). The political theologian most relevant to IR is the first of them: Carl Schmitt2. Schmitt is widely known these days; there is no reason for me to go into his life and the controversy surrounding him. Over the last few decades Schmitt scholarship has grown massive as a new generation of political and legal theorists have discovered his work, as it is now widely available in translation. Schmitt's significance to con temporary IR theory was a topic of a recent anthology titled The International Thought of Carl Schmitt (see Odysseos and Petito, 2007). Most of the attention there is paid to Schmitt's inter-war book The Concept of the Political and the post-war The Nomos of the Earth; both are highly relevant texts, of course, that address many of the international issues of our neo-Schmittean moment. There are (at least) two other texts that the theorists of IR should try reading, in my opinion: Political Theol ogy (1922) and Political Theology IP (1970). What I am offering here is a reading of Schmitt that aims to make political theology - 'the explicit attempt to relate dis course about God to the organization of bodies in space time' (Cavanaugh and Scott, 2004) - momentous for IR today. The crux of my reading is the metaphysical image that, for Schmitt, connects the political to the theological, making the pres ence of the latter endemic in the former. In Political Theology Schmitt declares that '[a]ll significant concepts of the mod ern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts not only because of their historical development [...] but also because of their systematic structure, the recognition of which is necessary for a sociological consideration of these concepts' (Schmitt, 1985: 36). Schmitt's sociology of concepts is concerned with identifying metaphysical images of reality with temporal forms of political organisation: 'estab Ferspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="5">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS lishing proof of two spiritual but at the same time substantial identities' (ibid.: 45). From this follows an interesting analysis of the concept of state sovereignty, which, for Schmitt, shares a 'spiritual but at the same time substantial' identity with belief in Cod: In the theory of the state of the seventeenth century, the monarch is identified with God and has in the state a position exactly analogous to that attributed to God in the Cartesian system of the world [...] A continuous thread runs through the metaphysical, political and sociological conceptions that postulate the sovereign as a personal unit and primeval creator. (Schmitt, 1985: 46-47) The systematic structure inherited from Christian theology serves a secular purpose because '[n]o political system can survive even a generation with only naked tech niques of holding power. To the political belongs the idea, because there is no pol itics without authority and no authority without an ethos of belief.' (Schmitt, 1996: 17) On this premise Schmitt elaborates his well known definition of the sovereign as the person who decides on the exception (Schmitt, 1985: 5; see also Hirst, 1987). The emphasis is on the person here, because Schmitt argues that '[t]o represent in an eminent sense can only be done by a person, that is, not simply a "deputy" but an authoritative person or an idea which, if represented, also becomes personified' (Schmitt, 1996: 21 ). With this he essentially subscribes to Hobbes's covenant with the leviathan: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this as sembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and au thorise all his actions in like manner. This done, the multitude so united in one person is called a commonwealth; in Latin, civitas. This is the generation of that great leviathan, or rather, to speak more reverently, of that mortal god to which we owe, under the immortal God, our peace and defence. For by this author ity, given him by every particular man in the Commonwealth, he hath the use of so much power and strength conferred on him that, by terror thereof, he is enabled to form the wills of them all, to peace at home, and mutual aid against their enemies abroad. (Hobbes, 1996: ch. xviii, capitals in original) The crux of this covenant is personification: it is made with 'this man' or 'this as sembly of men'. Schmitt argues that when we give up our right to govern ourselves, it is absolutely necessary that we give it to someone - a person in the actual or cor poreal sense of the term - who uses it for our protection at home and abroad. This is concrete sovereignty: the highest legally independent, underived power that ra Pferepectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="6">MIKA LUOMA-AHO diates from an authoritative person, or something authoritative personified, with/n a state in every state. What Schmitt refuses to accept is any attempt to substitute a person with something else, a legal abstraction or a political theory perhaps. Ab stractions and theories can do little against the enemy. (Schmitt, 1985:16-35) Schmitt's vitriol is in self-defence. The second essay in Political Theology is a de fence of concrete sovereignty against precisely such theories and abstractions. Schmitt singles out 'association theory' and monistic jurisprudence as the embodi ments of his antithesis, but what he is criticising is the early 20th century liberal no tion of a modern state. Most of Schmitt's polemic is set against Hugo Krabbe and Hans Kelsen. In his The Modern Idea of the State, Krabbe absolutely opposed the doctrine of sovereignty, the idea that political authority is a person standing outside the law. Krabbe argued that the term belonged to a political theory of the absolutist era, whereas in the Rechtsstaat positive law has gradually superseded the sovereign claim to unconditional obedience. For Krabbe the authority of the state was noth ing other than the impersonal authority of the law: '[hjence there is only one ruling power, the power of law' (Krabbe, 1922: 2). This was the revelation of the modern idea of the state: We no longer live under the dominion of persons, either natural persons or fic titious legal persons, but under the dominion of norms, of spiritual forces. [...] The old foundation which heretofore had mainly supported the life of the com munity, the personal authority of the sovereign, has been compelled to give place (or at least is more and more giving place) to another foundation which is derived from the spiritual nature of mankind. [...] These forces rule in the strictest sense of the word. Obedience can be freely rendered to these forces, for the very reason that they do proceed from the spiritual nature of mankind. (Krabbe, 1922: 8-9) Unfortunately, Krabbe writes, political theory had not taken account of this, but per sistently clung to the 'old' idea of sovereignty: 'It is indeed difficult for it to free itself from the conception of a personal power which is supported by a tradition of cen turies and from a terminology adapted to this conception' (Krabbe, 1922:10). This is also what Hans Kelsen's 'pure jurisprudence' was about - de-personifi cation of the concept of sovereignty. Kelsen identified the state with its legal order and deprived sovereignty of all relevancy to any person, physical or corporate. The state was a normative order, and the idea of the person-hood of the state could only symbolise this order, if it was needed at all. Indeed, after World War II, Kelsen relegated the idea to the historical and ideological domain of totalitarian ism: Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="7">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS Political absolutism [has] a political theory at its disposal which describes the state as an absolute entity existing independently of its subjects. According to this theory, the state is not merely a group of individuals; it is more than the sum-total of its subjects. It is a collective, and that means here a super-individ ual, body which is even more real than its members, a mystic organism and as such a supreme and super-human authority, whose visible representative or in carnation is the ruler, whether he be called the monarch, Führer or Generalis simo. It is the concept of sovereignty serving the purpose of this deification of the state which implies the worship of the ruler as a god-like being. (Kelsen, 1948: 909-910) Kelsen agreed with Schmitt in his belief that the image of the personified state had a religious origin, but he argued that this image had become antiquated along with mediaeval theology and that democratic legalism no longer needed deification. At this point in time and with his intellectual background, Schmitt was hardly in a po sition to object. What we can learn from this discussion is in the image at the centre of the debate. A king on his throne with the people at his feet is the classical image of sovereign political authority. What Kelsen argues is that we do not need this image in the mod ern state. What Schmitt argues is that even though the picture may change, it al ways tells us the same story: it does not have to be a king sitting on a throne, but the people always hurry at someone's feet. Hobbes agrees: 'subjection, command, right, and power, are accidents, not of powers, but of persons' (Hobbes, 1996: ch. xxxxii). A single person can be the highest, but so can an assembly or a majority capable of making political decisions on behalf of a people. What matters is that there is some one that represents political unity: If the formula is no longer: One God - One King, but: One God - One Peo ple, and if the political side of political theology is no longer oriented towards the single monarch but towards a people, then we turn to democracy. (Schmitt, 2008: 72) SYMBOLISM, CHRIST AND THE STATE Since this is an exercise in Symbolic Reading, it may be useful to discuss what is meant by this term. Symbolism is of course a difficult thing to pin down exactly, but I believe a simple definition is likely to suffice for our present purpose. A symbol is a tangible representation of some intangible reality. Symbols are like containers for something we understand to be 'uncontainable': words, actions, and images that bridge the gap between our limited abilities to conceive and understand, and some thing that by its nature transcends those limited abilities (Chernus, 1986: 6). For ex Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="8">MIKA LUOMA-AHO ample, a picture of'Finland' drawn on a map and the Finnish flag worn on a sleeve are tangible representations of the state of Finland. What is printed on paper or fab ric, of course, can not exhaustively express what Finland 'is', but symbols like these are all we have, all that Finland has. If I am not alone - that is, I belong to a collec tive of Finns - there is no other means but symbolism to represent this we. in other words: symbolism is the essence of political identification. In the previous section I discussed a theoretical debate concerning the possibil ity of containing political authority in the symbol of a person. Whence came such symbolism? Why do we subject ourselves to the power of personification? We can locate the urge in ourselves. Schmitt reasons that '[a]s long as the human being is anthropomorphic, that is, a being modelled on humanity, he understands himself and his social relations in such "images'" (Schmitt, 2008: 57). Leonard Barkan ar gues that 'the human body is both phylogenetically and ontogenetically one of the first and most basic entities the mind can grasp' (Barkan, 1975: 62). It seems natu ral to make sense of objects of discourse such as human motivations, goals, actions, and characteristics in our own terms. Michael Walzer emphasises that the image of the body has not been used simply as a decorative metaphor applied by a writer who has already grasped the nature of political community and wishes to convey this understanding. The image is rather as prior to theoretic understanding as it is to ar ticulation, and necessary to both. When the state is first imagined as a body politic, then a particular mode for understanding the nature of the state is made available. The image does not reinforce existing political ideas as much as it underlies them: 'It provides an elementary sense of what the political community is like, of how phys ically distinct and solitary individuals are joined together' (Walzer, 1967:194). When we imagine and represent the state as a body, we bring it into close relation with the organicist world: '[a] single vocabulary describes animal bodies and political com munities and makes the second appear almost as familiar, as natural, as well orga nized as the first' (Walzer, 1967:195). According to Charles Taylor (2004:12-13), the body politic is a typical pre-mod ern social imaginary. Pre-modern forms of society reflect an 'embedded' under standing of human life, where the polity itself is seen as God's creation. This image naturally provides a basis for an hierarchical organisation of society, where peo ple find their place in different orders of society - some of greater dignity and value than others. This is why organism and body have been powerful political metaphors in the pre-modern social order: they have been easy to employ in ar ranging functions to the orders - that the feet are below the head is how it should be. We know that bodily figurations have been employed in political discourse since the Ancients, though they are likely to have a much richer history than we can tell (see, e.g., Coker, 1910; Laird, 2005). The metaphor of the embodied polis we have Perspectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="9">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS today is, however, an artefact of the Christian civilisation. It has a biblical origin and this is where we begin. The symbol that joined the members of the early Christian community together was the body of Jesus Christ. Paul the Apostle writes that 'For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.' (Rom. 12:4-5; see also 1 Cor. 6:15,10:16-17,12:12-27, ESV.) What is the meaning of the identification of Christians becoming one in corpus ChristR For the first disciples, bodily community with Jesus did not only mean participation in his teaching, but liv ing and suffering with him in bodily community - this is literally what the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is all about. When the physical body of Christ died on the cross, its place on earth was taken by the church. For Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the church is the present Christ himself: 'While we are used to thinking of the church as an institution, we ought instead to think of it as a person with a body, although of course a person in an unique sense' (Bonhoeffer, 2003:218, emphasis in original). The sacrament of baptism incorporates a man into this body, into the new or 'second' humanity (1. Cor 15:47), in which there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither free nor slave. According to Otto Gierke (1913: 11-12), medieval political thought proceeded from the idea that not only those who shared communion, not only the church, but mankind in its totality was conceived as corpus Christi. This universalist under standing was not alien to biblical theology. Jesus, like Adam before him, was both an individual and a personification of humanity - when Adam fell, the old human ity fell; when Jesus was crucified, the new humanity was crucified. Thus, the life, death and resurrection of Jesus are events which implied all human beings. Those who had been baptised and thus had become members in the body of the Christ were different from the lot in that they were no longer in the flesh of Adam, but had won death in Christ. This is the theological context, and this is where interpretation really begins. This is also where the Roman Church has played an active role, as in the overall administration of the affairs of the universal corpus Christi. If the new humanity was one, there could only be one hierarchy, one authority, one state; and that state could be none other than the Church God himself had created. From this premise the Roman Church deduced the proposition that it was the authority of the Christ that was on the highest summit in temporal as well as ecclesiastical matters. The politi cal conclusion of this proposition was, at least for Rome, unequivocal: creation itself places temporal rulers hierarchically under the Vicar of the Christ, for were there additional heads for emperors in the body politic, we would have before us a mon strosity instead of the son of God. In his The King's Two Bodies, Ernst FJ. Kantorowicz (1957:193-232) brilliantly doc uments the history of this image in mediaeval theology and jurisprudence. Bodily Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="10">MIKA LUOMA-AHO metaphors were employed at the time to reinforce the idea of the Christian com munity as a whole as well as that of its secular parts. As the Roman Church bid for a more influential secular presence after the investiture controversy, it began to re imagine itself as a temporal body: a political and legal organism on a level with sec ular political entities, which were at this time beginning to assert their political presence vis-q-vis the Church. With this image of the corpus mysticum Christi, the Church itself secularised its symbolism and politicised the body of Jesus Christ, which resulted in that the ideologues of the nascent territorial state followed suit and also began to employ bodily metaphors. While the Roman Church was the 'perfect pro totype of an absolute and rational monarchy on a mystical basis', at the same time 'the State showed increasingly a tendency to become a quasi-church or a mystical corporation on a rational basis' (Kantorowicz, 1957:194). Deciding this struggle in favour of the territorial state, the role played by one Ger man monk, Martin Luther, was key. This is basically what Luther had to say: a Chris tian is not a humble subject of a universal hierarchy administered by the Pope in Rome, but instead belongs to two different kingdoms ruled by two separate gov ernments. The two kingdoms refer to the two overlapping spheres of Christian ex istence, and the governments to the two ways in which God governs the world (Steinmetz, 2002:115). The kingdom of God is the realm of revelation and faith. Be cause in the spiritual realm all Christians are equal, there is no need for authority in the church. The dialectical partner of the spiritual realm, the kingdom of the world, is the realm of reason and unbelief that is ruled hierarchically and 'by the sword'. This was the wedge Luther drove between the church and the state: one was not a part of the other, but both were separate and distinct and with clearly defined roles and spheres of influence. The Church had no influence in the temporal sphere. The ec clesiastical officer had no coercive authority; the state alone possessed the sword. (Whitford, 2003:180-181.) Luther sided with temporal authorities in the political encounters of his day. What Luther did was that he provided a theological apologia for the principle of non-inter vention in temporal affairs. In the polemical context this declaration undermined the au thority of the Roman Church in Germany. In his 1520 To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation Concerning the Reform of the Christian Estate, Luther demands for the pope to stick to ecclesiastical matters and to leave the 'lands' to take care of themselves: It should be decreed that no temporal matter is to be referred to Rome, but that all such cases shall be left to the temporal authority, as the Romanists them selves prescribe in that canon law of theirs, which they do not observe. It should be the pope's duty to be the most learned in the Scriptures and the holiest (not in the name only but in fact) and to regulate matters which concern the faith and holy life of Christians. He should hold the primates and archbishops to this Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="11">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS task, and help them in dealing with these matters and taking care of these re sponsibilities. This is what St. Paul teaches in I Corinthians 6:7", and he takes the Corinthians severely to task for their concern with worldly things. That such matters are dealt with in Rome causes unbearable grief in every land. It in creases the costs, and, moreover, these judges do not know the usage, laws, and customs of these lands, so that they often do violence to the facts and base their decisions on their own laws and precedents. As a result the contesting parties often suffer injustice. (Luther, 1999c: 160) With this letter, Luther told German princes that they not only can, but should de clare their 'lands' politically independent territorial states, never mind Rome. Though the treaties were signed in Westphalia a hundred years after Luther, the core prin ciples of our modern, secular international society were articulated here. For Luther Hess Waring, Martin Luther was not only a prophet or a forerunner, but 'the founder of the modern theory of the state; not that he secularised it, but he declared it to be absolutely separate and distinct from the church and the sole possessor of coercive authority and sovereign power' (Waring, 1910: 278-279). Though the Reformation can be written into the master narrative of enlightened governance, along with incidents like the Revolution in France and artefacts like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the theme you will not find in Luther is civil liberty. What you will find instead is the Pauline ethos of civil obedience. For Luther, the fourth commandment5 was the constitutional norm for all authority in the king dom of the world: For everybody must be ruled and subject to other men. So we see here again how many good works are taught in this commandment, for in it all our life is made subject to other men. That is the reason obedience is so highly praised, and all virtue and good works are included in it. (Luther, 1999a: 182) Thus, one man's political authority over another flowed directly from God, and the burden of the Christian was to submit. Luther was an advocate of civil obedience be cause he feared the chaos of anarchy more than he did the tyranny of authority (Whitford, 2003: 181). Chaos was the devil's handiwork: it always hurt the weak more than it did the powerful, the innocent more than the guilty. Luther was adamant in his view that there could never be an authority tyrannical enough to justify riot and rebellion against them: For God has appointed subjects to care for themselves as individuals, has taken the sword from them, and has put it into the hands of another. If they rebel against this, get others to join them and break loose, and take the sword, then Perspectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="12">MIKA LUOMA-AHO before Cod they are worthy of condemnation and death. Overlords, on the other hand, are appointed to be persons who exist for the sake of the commu nity, and not for themselves alone. They are to have the support of their subjects and are to bear the sword. Compared to his overlord the emperor, a prince is not a prince, but an individual who owes obedience to the emperor, as do all others, each for himself. But when he is seen in relationship to his own subjects he is as many persons as he has people under him and attached to him. So the emperor, too, when compared with God, is not an emperor, but an individual person like all others; compared with his subjects, however, he is as many times emperor as he has people under him. The same thing can be said of all other rulers. When compared to their overlord, they are not rulers at all and are stripped of all authority. When compared with their subjects, they are adorned with all authority. (Luther, 1999c: 126) This is also the image pictured on the frontispiece of Hobbes' Leviathan. Man acts in the image of God as he gives up his right of rule and joins the bodily community of his polis. Why should he do this? Because the kingdom of the world is a kingdom of evil, where 'men would devour one another, seeing that the whole world is evil and that among thousands there is scarcely a single true Christian' (Luther, 1999b: 91 ). In this world reduced to chaos, '[n]o one could support wife and child, feed himself, and serve God' (ibid.). Were it not for the wickedness of sin, there would be no need for a political order, no need for the sword in this world, in any world. In order to preserve the life and property of the law-abiding at home and to defend against enemies abroad, God has ordained a second government: the government of the state. Most of us are prob ably not sure about the 'God' part, but inherit the state nevertheless. This is why we have this symbolic image - human beings becoming one in a body politic - be cause it seems to be the only thing we got against evil, the last 'man' standing be tween it and us. We need the image of the state because we need its sword: none of us alone can boast enough power and strength to overcome the terrors of this world. The community we thus imagine is not unlike corpus Christi in that it gives our becoming one a symbolic form and identifies us as parts of a particular common wealth, as British, Finnish, French, German, or whatever else. What distinguishes the corpus mysticum of the state is that it does not embody the love of God and the promise of eternal life - no, not love but fear of the neighbour in this life.

The treaty codified the principle oí cuius regio eius religio, which essen tially meant that both Catholic and Protestant states had to tolerate each other's ex istence. Westphalia has been made an epochal signpost in international history. Andreas Osiander (2001 ) argues that the prevalent image of Westphalia is a myth utilised by the realists of IR to sacralise state sovereignty. According to Osiander, the pre-Westphalian system did not disappear overnight, but over a longer period in which the revolution in France was probably a more significant turning point. Daniel Philpott (2001: 98-99) argues that Western Europe would have seen a mod ern state system even without the reformation and the ensuing wars of religion, but the process would have taken longer than it did. Be that as it may, we now have a system of'modern' states. It is quite easy to think that the states today are secular institutions, even though we know that the history of the idea, the symbolic image of that society is of theological origin. It is easy now because of everything that has happened to our social imaginary since the pre-mod ern era, in 'modernity'. One of the things Luther and the reformation, and especially the democratic revolutions, brought about was a new, secularised embedding for temporal authority. Since the state was no longer a part of the universal hierarchy of God's cosmos, it had to come up with a new understanding of history and modes of narration for its existence in time and place - this is basically the story Taylor (2007) tells us in A Secular Age. One of the most powerful of these modes has of course been nationalism, the idea that people belong to one another in virtue of a common language, common culture, common religion, and common history. While most of these shared understandings and narratives are often pure invention, this has hardly weakened the political impact of nationalism. Even though states or nations are not 'empirical things', but rather questions of col lective belief, they still provide the starting point for doing IR today. 'States' is the con ventional answer to the following question: 'What do we see when we look at the world political?' Writing in his 1899 Philosophical Theory of the State, the British ide alist Bernard Bosanquet answered that [t]he Nation State [...] is the widest organisation which has the common expe rience necessary to found a common life. This is why it is recognised as abso lute in power over the individual, and as his representative and champion in the affairs of the world outside. It is obvious that there can be but one such ab solute power in relation to any one person; and that, so far as the world is or ganised, there must be one; and, in fact, his discharge from one allegiance can only be accepted by another. (Bosanquet, 1899: 320) We might phrase it differently today, but the 'world outside' is still a world of states. Yes, 'people talk, and within certain limits behave as if there were a world commu Ferspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="14">M1KA LUOMA-AHO nity' (Carr, 2001:147), but at this point in time, we do not have such a community, a civitas maxima to use one of Martin Wight's (1992: 40-44) terms. There are, of course, exceptions, but this is the rule: the world political is an international society or community that has states, i.e. not people, as members. This is the state of the art today. In his Social Theory of International Politics, Alexan der Wendt not only made constructivism a household approach in IR, but, by claim ing that 'states are people too', he also (re-)introduced personification of the state to IR theory. Indeed, it was the analogy between the actor-ness of human individu als in society and that of states in international society that made Wendt's (1999: ch. 5) theory social in the first place. This was a natural assumption to make because states are systematically represented in discourse as 'big people' with human capa bilities and characteristics. We hear and read about it every day: the United States is a 'bully', North Korea a 'rogue', &amp;c. Come to think of it, it is very difficult (if not nearly impossible) to communicate about international relations without para phrasing states and their relations through personifying metaphors. What does contemporary IR theory make of all this? For a realist mind like Wendt's, behind personification, there are 'real actors to which we can legitimately attribute anthropomorphic qualities like desires, beliefs and intentionality' (Wendt, 1999:197). For a narrativist like Iver Neumann (2004), states are not rea/-ly persons, but only like persons, and personification should not be more than an analogy, a comparison, a metaphor. Colin Wight, another thinker with a realist mindset, criti cises the metaphorical treatment of theoretical terms (such as the state) for allow ing the theorist an escape from ontology: 'If theoretical posits are not attempts to refer to real entities the theorist has no obligation to give an account of them' (Wight, 2004: 272). For Wight, this is a 'misdescription of the practice of science': if metaphors are not scientifically measured against reality, e.g. if we do not inquire into how like a person a state is, '[w]hy do we need the state and other political fictions when religions have always had perfectly adequate "as if" entities that have the added advantage of explaining everything?' (Wight, 2004: 273, emphasis in origi nal) This is a well-grounded question, but only if we assume that IR is not a religion, and that the polity of the state has not provided or at least attempted to provide an ad equate explanation to everything. Wight's remark is a typical example of secular IR arrogating to itself the right to define religion and its role in politics and science, pretensions of universality and claims of superiority over non-secular alternatives implied. As rightly noted by Elizabeth Shakman Hurd (2004), the demarcation of the category of 'religion' from 'politics' is a highly politicised decision that has yet to be fully accounted for in Western social theory and practice, IR included. IR is not the neutral observer it pretends to be, but is actually already implicated in reli gion by its own secularist self-perception (Laustsen and Waever, 2000). Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="15">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS To the question of whether or not states should be imagined as having person hood, Wendt replies in the affirmative: [Sjtates help bring order, and yes, even justice to the world, and if we want to have states then it is better they take the form of persons rather than something more amorphous, because this will help make their effects more politically ac countable. (Wendt, 2004: 316) For Wendt, the personified state is not a vernacular for totalitarianism, but quite the opposite: it 'provides a metaphysical basis for liberalism' (Wendt, 2004: 292). If we do not have to 'beware of organicism', as even a cursory reading of the history of bodily politics might suggest and Kelsen and Neumann (2004) certainly do, we have to read Wendt within the tradition of E. H. Carr, who introduced personification to IR - or is it rather IR to personification? Since its very beginning in the early twenti eth century, the only form of agency understood by the discipline has been anthro pomorphic, and though the content of this understanding has been revised, its form has remained intact. In his The Twenty Years' Crisis 1919-1939, E. H. Carr defended the idea of the per sonified state against its 'Utopian' critics6. For Carr, personification of the state pro vided a foundation for the creation of international law on the basis of natural law, which rendered possible the conferring of duties and rights to states in international relations - i.e. an international morality. The Utopians denounced the idea of person hood of the state, firstly, on the grounds that it was fictitious unlike living human be ings and, secondly, because it denied or took precedence to an international morality based on individuals. Despite having a liberal and progressive origin, the growth of the power and complication of the institutions of the embodied state has made its rights more conspicuous than its duties. For its critics, personification had by the early twentieth century become little more than an assertion of unlimited rights of the state over human beings, and the critics thereby saw it as an authori tarian idea to be rejected with fervour just like Krabbe and Kelsen did. (Carr, 2001 : 136-137) For Carr, the controversy over the truth or falsehood of the personified state was meaningless and misleading 'because it does not purport to be a fact, but a cate gory of thought necessary to clear thinking about international relations' (Carr, 2001:138). Person-hood of the state was certainly fictitious, but as such, it was 'a necessary fiction or hypothesis - an indispensable tool devised by the human mind for dealing with the structure of a developed society' (ibid.: 137). According to Carr, personification did not mean authoritarianism per se: like any other tool, it was always prone to misusage, and 'to decry it on the ground of the use to which it is sometimes put is no more intelligent than to abuse a tool for killing a man' Perspectives VoL 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="16">MIKA LUOMA-AHO (ibid.: 139). Personification could just as well be used for liberal purposes by em phasising the duties of the state vis-g-vis both the individual and other states. Per sonification did not mean that the modern territorial state was the only imaginable form of political organisation either, but only that as long as it was generally ac cepted as such, personification was necessary for the human mind to come to terms with it: The fiction of the the group-person, having moral rights and obligations and consequently capable of moral behaviour, is an indispensable instrument of modern society; and the most indispensable of these fictitious group-persons is the state. In particular, it does not seem possible to discuss international pol itics in other terms. (Carr, 2001: 137) It was clear to Carr that the 'spirit of international relations' seemed more likely to be improved by accepting personification than by decrying it, and in any case, the human political imagination would have to undergo a radical change before it would discover an equally convenient and effective political fiction to replace personifica tion (Carr, 2001:139). But since personification was a fiction, did this not make the international community/society fictional also? Of course, but this is of no conse quence whatsoever. According to Carr, 'we need not to regard as "unreal" a hy pothesis which is accepted in certain contexts as a guide to individual behaviour' (ibid.: 139). In other words, as long as states are the primary actors in world politics and the people acting in the name of these actors are agreed in that this should be, the hypothesis remains effective. The hypothesis on which Carr based his conception of international community provides the paradigm on which Alexander Wendt bases his Social Theory. Wendt begins with a direct analogy: 'There cannot be a states system without states any more than there can be a (human) society without people. The units make their re spective systems possible' (Wendt, 1999:194). Thus, states are people too: 'purpo sive actors with a sense of Self' (ibid.: 194). Wendt needs personification to make an assumption of the state-as-actor which draws from and develops substantially Ken neth N. Waltz's Theory of International Politics (see Waltz, 1979). According to Wendt, though the state-as-actor assumption is central to international relations, it has been in a state of neglect in IR theory (Wendt, 1999:195). Wendt also notes that it is not just academics who personify the state, but all of us: 'In our daily lives citi zens and policy-makers alike routinely treat states as if they were people, talking about them as if they had the same kinds of intentional properties that we attribute to each other' (Wendt, 1999: 195). For Wendt, as well as for Carr before him, it is through personification that the realities of the international community (Carr) or the system (Wendt) become real in the first place. Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="17">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS Whether you are a realist, a liberal, an institutionalise a Marxist, a constructivist, a behaviouralist, a feminist, a postmodernist, or something in between, the chances are that the idea of state personhood, at some fundamental level, makes sense to you: '[¡In a field in which almost everything is contested, this seems to be one thing on which almost all of us agree' (Wendt, 2004: 289). And it is not just the academics, but all of us who 'systematically personify the state'; 'this is how most of us, most of the time, think about the state in world politics' (Wendt, 2004: 289). In other words, IR continues as a disciplinary tradition that works to conserve the political ontology of states and their world politics - as long as it does not come up with something else to conserve and justify, that is. If we give up the embodied and personified state, we flush out everything or nearly everything we (thought we) knew about international relations. Or as Carr puts it: 'Personification is the cate gory of thought which expresses the continuity of institutions; and of all institutions the state is the one whose continuity it is most essential to express' (Carr, 2001 : 138). CONCLUSION What I am trying to say is that political theology is not only interesting and an im portant field in political studies - that it is worth it to read a single article about it, perhaps - but that it is especially so for IR now. The argument made in this article is that pre-modern metaphysical images of political society are replicated today when we personify the state. The premises of this argument are Schmitt's, of course, but the story continues without him. Charles Taylor's story is one of a 'long march' from an embedded to a disembedded society. A pre-modern society is one where political authority is in conceivable without God, where structures of society cannot be understood sepa rately from the divine, the higher, the numinous. According to Taylor, this imposed a certain verticality to society, which depended on the fact that it was God's creation and had its origins in 'higher time'. Thus, pre-modern authority is mediated author ity, as its 'subjects are only held together within an order that coheres through its apex, in the person of the king, through whom this order connects to higher time and the order of things' (Taylor, 2004:158). This was the ancien régime, the characteris tics of which most mediaeval regimes shared before the reformation and the demo cratic revolutions. (Taylor, 2004:187) Modern, secular societies are markedly different. The modern order no longer gives hierarchy or any structure of social differentation an ontological status. By con trast, the contemporary social imaginary sees us all as taking part in forming our po litical entity, to which all of us relate in the same way, as equal citizens. This is what Taylor means by the modern principle of horizontal society: 'We have moved from a hierarchical order of personalized links to an impersonal egalitarian one; from a ver PerspectKes Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="18">MIKA LUOMA-AHO tical of mediated access to horizontal, direct-access societies' (Taylor, 2004: 158). This is what Krabbe tried to say when he argued that we no longer live under the do minion of persons, but under the dominion of norms: 'in every field, even in that of international relations, the authority of law is growing' (Krabbe, 1922: 10). Taylor has lived to see it: This whole development reaches its culmination in our time, in the period after the Second World War, in which the notion of rights as prior to and untouch able by political structures becomes widespread - although they are now called 'human' rather than 'natural' rights - and in which this consciousness is given expression in the entrenchment of charters of rights, by which ordinary legis lation can be set aside when it violates these fundamental norms. These decla rations of rights are in a sense the clearest expression of our modern idea of a moral order underlying the political, which the political has to respect. (Taylor, 2004: 173) This is a brilliant diagnosis, and I subscribe to every single word of it. As citizens of secular modernity - say, as passport holding Britons, Finns, Frenchmen and Ger mans - we enjoy full membership privileges since it is us standing there on the hori zon; we are the ones that make up the one that is the social body. There are exceptions to this rule - there always is an exception! - but this is the pre-political foundation of liberal democratic order. But what about the political foundation? 'The political entity cannot by its very nature be universal in the sense of embracing all of humanity and the entire world', writes Schmitt, '[t]he political world is a pluriverse, not a universe' (Schmitt, 1976: 53). If the different states, religions and all the other human groupings on earth should be so unified that conflict among them would be impossible, a political foundation would no longer be required - we would need 'neither state nor kingdom nor em pire, neither republic nor monarchy, neither aristocracy nor democracy, neither pro tection nor obedience' (ibid.: 57). Although some of us have moved from a vertical to a horizontal society and have pre-political foundations of rock at home, it needs to be said - even though we know this well enough already - that this is not (yet) so in 'our' international relations. In the 'world outside' there is no political entity and we are not even the ones making up the society. Yes, the authority of law is grow ing as ever in international relations, yet the states are the ones carrying all the swords and embodying us in that international society. Political theology is an attempt to relate discourse about God to the organisation of bodies in space time (Cavanaugh and Scott, 2004). International relations is a dis course firmly embedded on an ontology of order: it is a sublime act of faith in the positive existence of a vertical society above and a pre-modern authority over man. Perspectives Vol 17, No. 2 2009</page><page sequence="19">IR AND THE SECULARISATION OF THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS What we need to do in IR is to relate the state as one of the gods. Political theology of IR is a cratological7 political theology: it is premised - for the time that remains, that is - on a radical non-autarchy of the human being in the world political and questions those who are in charge of this bystander, from the highest authority downward, in 'international relations'. What is the foundation of this authority? How is it executed? How is it legitimated? ENDNOTES 1 Daniel Philpott (2000) locates the religious roots of modern international relations in the Christian Re formation. There is, of course, political theology outside the sphere of Western Christianity (see, e.g., Khir, 2004; Ochs, 2004). 2 According to Oliver O'Donovan (1996: 4), the modern use of the term 'political theology' is generally held to begin with Schmitt's Politische Theologie (first published in 1922). For a good contextualisation of Schmitt as a political theologian, see Hollerich (2004). 3 Schmitt made a habit of writing sequels to his earlier works in his later years. Political Theology II is a re joinder to some criticism of political theology published in between Schmitt's volumes, particularly Erik Peterson's Mono the/smus als politisches Problem and Hans Blumenberg's The Legitimacy of the Modern Age. The second volume does not make new arguments inasmuch as it sheds light on the central claims of the first. What makes II important is that it testifies to Schmitt's continuing faith in the claims made in Political Theology more than 50 years after their publication. 4 To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?' Paul is trying to say here that righteous followers of Jesus are able pass judge ment on 'worldly' matters without outside intervention. The fact that some of Paul's Corinthian brethren had lawsuits against one another before 'unrighteous' Jewish arbitrators was very shameful for the whole Christian community in Corinth (Malina and Pilch, 2006: 82). 5 'Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your Cod is giving you.' (Ex. 20:12, ESV). 6 Peter Wilson (1998) gives a very useful contextualisation of Carr's arguments in the so-called First De bate. 'This is the adjective used by Wolf-Daniel Hartwich, Aleida Assmann and Jan Assmann in their afterword to The Political Theology of Paul by Jacob Taubes - a book that is, by the way, compulsory reading for any one doing anything with political theology. In contrast to Taubes' horizontal or sociological political the ology, Schmitt understands the political theology vertically, as an interpretation and a foundation of sovereignty 'as a nexus of authority, revelation, and obedience' (Taubes, 2004). According to Hartwich, Ass mann and Assmann, the difference between the horizontal-sociological and vertical-cratological political theologies stems from their religious reference: in Taubes's case, Judaism and in Schmitt's, Christianity.
