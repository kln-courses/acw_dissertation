<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTACT PERIOD PETROGLYPHS IN MACHIAS BAY, MAINE Mark Hedden The discovery of two previously unrecorded petroglyph sites in Machias Bay containing Native American representations of seventeenth century sailing vessels has enabled a more precise definition of Maine rock art from late prehistoric through the period of European contact and early historic period. The petroglyph subjects and imagery suggest the decline and increasingly marginal nature of the shaman 's traditional role between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. INTRODUCTION Three pecked petroglyph representations of seventeenth century European sailing vessels have been recorded among a total of nine Native American petroglyph sites clustered near the upper end of Machias Bay, Maine. The ship representations were executed near the highest utilized surfaces on tide-washed ledges that contain a record of petroglyph activity extending back an estimated 3000 years before present [BP] (Hedden 1 996). The ship images are directly associated with traditional Native American imagery and show the same manner of execution and the same degree of subsequent erosion and patination as the associated traditional petroglyphs. The architecture of the three single-masted ships matches the known features of small vessels used by French, English and Dutch mariners of the first third of the seventeenth century. Small vessels of this kind were used by explorers seeking good sites for settlement and fur trading opportunities in shallow harbors along the coasts of New England and the Gulf of Maine. Brief and intermittent Native American contacts with earlier voyagers of European origin may have occurred in the Gulf of Maine in the sixteenth century. Trade items of European manufacture, such as "copper and brass ornaments and kettles, iron axes, European clothing, and sailing vessels called shallops," most likely obtained from European fishing and trading vessels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, were being brought into the Gulf of Maine by native middlemen (Bourque and Whitehead 1985:327-331), but there is no record of European mariners entering Machias Bay before the first decade of the seventeenth century. By tradition the petroglyphs were made by Native American religious leaders we call shamans. The spiritual content of the petroglyphs is also supported by the nature of the signs. Sign language elements and a large cross associated with one vessel petroglyph seem to express one shaman's understanding of a major difference in belief between Christian and Native ideology. As such, the ship petroglyphs represent a unique record of the initial meetings of Native Americans with Europeans along the coast of Maine. This article presents imagery from two recently discovered petroglyph sites in Machias Bay and integrates the new material into the sequence of the Machias Bay Petroglyph Tradition already developed (Hedden 1996). The newly recorded sites provide significant links to late prehistoric and historic rock art in the Canadian Shield. To a cultural historian the sites are important because the ships and associated designs give clues to what was going on in the minds of the Native Americans, or more specifically, the shamans who made them, at the time of European contact. The sequence of changes in petroglyphs following direct contact with Europeans described below show how the role of the shaman, as expressed in their own imagery, seems to have become increasingly marginal following contact with Europeans. In Northeastern North America, there is a substantial corpus of recorded rock art, most of which can be tied to shamanistic activity within the past 2000 or 3000 years by groups who presumably spoke languages derived from the Algonkian family (Dewdney and Kidd 1962; Hedden 1996; Rajnovich 1994; Schoolcraft 1851-57; Snow 1976; Steinbring 1993; Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). We have explanations of many of the Archaeology of Eastern North America (2002) 30:1-20</page><page sequence="2">2 Archaeology of Eastern North America more esoteric signs collected and published since European contact by missionaries, traders, ethnographers and archaeologists (Mallery 1893; Hoffman 1888; Rajnovich 1994). We have the beginnings of both localized and regional sequences of rock art styles which can be integrated with archaeology towards a better understanding of how changes in shamanistic practice relate to changes in cultural situation (Hedden 1996; Rajnovich 1 994; Steinbring 1 993). The Machias Bay petroglyph tradition, while located on the eastern edge of the territory occupied by the Algonkian language family, offers an unusual opportunity to explore the entire sequence of styles covering ca. 3000 years of the late prehistoric Woodland or Ceramic period through European Contact. THE SETTING AND THE SITES Machias Bay is located in the approximate center of the historic range of Passamaquoddy /Malecite groups, originally identified in the seventeenth century by the French as the Etchemin (Bourque 1989). The two sites increase the number of rock art sites clustered around the mouth of the Machias River to nine, perhaps the largest extant concentration of prehistoric rock art along the Northeast coast. Work on the seven sites discovered earlier has led to the development of a sequence of styles within a single, uninterrupted tradition which ended after European Contact. The subjects and formal attributes can be related to shamanistic rock art in historic Algonkian territory extending north into Canada and west to the Great Lakes. The dating of the styles is based on sequences of anthropomorphic (human-like) forms on single panels, as indicated by superimpositions, differential wear and patination and by relative position on the surface, and by the relative elevations of specific anthropomorphic forms that are representative of style periods throughout each site.1 The elevations were then tied to the rate of sea-level rise in Machias Bay which gradually exposed fresh surfaces for petroglyphs by washing off glacial till while eroding images on lower surfaces. The two new sites, listed as Maine Archaeological Survey sites 62.46 and 62.47, are located on bedrock ledges composed of metamorphosed slate near a larger island in Machias Bay. Over fifty glyphs were recorded on 62.46 (Figures 1 and 2) with an additional dozen on 62.47. Stylistic traits dated through analysis of other sites in the Machias Bay petroglyph tradition indicate that no extant recorded designs from 62.46 are earlier than ca. 500 A.D., and all were found on surfaces above the normal high tide or in fairly sheltered locations subject to daily tides. All of the recorded petroglyphs at 62.47 appear to date from European contact or later. About 99% of the original glacially striated surfaces on lower lying and more exposed ledges at both sites had been severely eroded or spalled off by water, sand and frost action. No signs of prehistoric petroglyphs were noted on the few fragments of original surfaces identified on these ledges. If any existed, they have been destroyed by natural processes. The terminal date for the making of petroglyphs in Machias Bay has not been established. An absolute date is indicated by several meters of freshly exposed bedrock on higher elevations that do not contain any petroglyphs. These unpatinated surfaces are present in all the recorded sites and can be attributed to a marked increase in the rate of sea level rise, beginning in the 1870s in Machias Bay that continues unabated to the present. The erosion of glacial till from most of the unpatinated bedrock probably dates after 1870. MACHIAS BAY SHIP IMAGES There are, in fact, three representations of seventeenth century sailing vessels that have been identified in Machias Bay, including the two that are reported here for the first time. A third small petroglyph, originally published in an inaccurate illustration reproduced by Garrick Mallery (1888), was relocated during fieldwork recording of site 62.1 for the Maine State Museum in 1977. The unique features of the site 62.1</page><page sequence="3">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 3 Figure 1. View of site 62.46 looking NW. Large boulder at left served as the site datum. ship were recognized then, but analysis had to wait for a more opportune time. This ship was also recorded and published by James Whittall (1988) in a version that is more accurate than Mallery's. All three ships were executed by pecking with a hammerstone and associated on surfaces with other more traditional pecked designs. The identification of three ship representations as early seventeenth century is based on an analysis of visible features of hull and rigging, comparison of these features to a limited series of illustrations of ships dating from before and after the seventeenth century, and research for documentary evidence of European visits to the Machias Bay area. Aside from the ship representations and associated Christian crosses, there are no other identifiable subjects of European origin represented in the Machias Bay petroglyphs or that directly refer to Europeans. A study of the surface print, photographs and a cast of the ship petroglyph at site 62.46 allowed identification of a number of features in hull design and rigging (Figure 3) which tend to be found together in sailing ships between 1575 and 1630 A.D. Some of these features, such as the use of a foresail between the bowsprit and mast, are only represented on smaller ships before 1600. Some features, such as a separation between the beaked bow and the bowsprit, began earlier and continued on warships into the eighteenth century. The features initially described below are structural elements of the hull and decking which are clear and distinct. Masts and rigging are less distinct and are described in a following section. Hull Profile The main deck is visible in the center, between a poopdeck raked upward toward the stern and a smaller forecastle which is set back from the bow and beak. The beak is short and curves upward. The overall length</page><page sequence="4">4 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 2. Plan of site 62.46.</page><page sequence="5">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 5 figure 3. Petroglyph of a European sailing vessel at site 62.46, Ledge 6, Isolated Panel #4, looking south. of the ship image at the level of the main deck is 23 cm. The poopdeck extends forward from the stern a distance of 9.3 cm, or about 40% of the ship's length at the maindeck level. Over that distance, the rake of the poopdeck rises above the main deck level from 4 cm at its forward edge to 6 cm at the stern. The main mast is stepped slightly forward of amidships at 14 cm from the stern (60% of the length of the vessel at the main deck level). The forecastle, beginning 16 cm forward of the stern, rises at a slant from the main deck. The slant or bulwark covers a distance of 3 cm from the main deck level to the top of the forecastle. The top of the forecastle extends another 5 cm parallel to the plane of the main deck (i.e., it is not raked). The stern, excluding the rudder, follows a shallow curve to the waterline. The bow rises at a more acute angle forward in a continuous shallow curve to the beak. At the waterline the ship is 1 8.5 cm long, excluding an excurvate protrusion just above the waterline of the stern which we interpret as representing the rudder. Including the rudder, the overall length of the ship from cutwater to the tailing rudder edge is 21 cm. There is a gap of 2 cm between the bow (base of the beak) and the bowsprit. The bowsprit extends upward at a low angle from the upper edge of the forecastle a distance of 1 2 cm (about 50% of the total length of the ship and about 1 0.5 cm beyond the bow).</page><page sequence="6">6 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 4. Sketch of a Dutch Cromster with a sprit-sail, c. 1600 A.D. After Culver 1935. 105. Mast and Rigging The ship features a single mast. There is no indication of a mizzen mast, normally stepped in the forepart of the stern castle. The main mast rises a little forward of amidships, as described, about 30 cm above the main deck. The stays meet at a point 20 cm above the main deck. On the petroglyph, the two main stays appear to rise, respectively, from the forward end of the stern castle and from the rear of the forecastle at about the midpoint of the slant or bul- wark. Each stay measures 20 cm. The forestay from the tip of the bowsprit to the main mast measures 24 cm. At the top of the main mast there is a long triangular pennant, extending forward 6.5 cm with a width at the main mast of 2 cm. One sail seems to be set, a fore- sail or jib, attached by a line below the forestay to the tip of the bowsprit as well as to a point above the forecastle where the slanted bulwark meets the line of the upper deck. A pole or jackstaff to hold a flag rises from the stern. Other lines or rigging are less clear, but offer clues to the probable date of the ship image. A line of dots from the midpoint of the stern castle rises 21 cm in a shallow curve to a point 4 cm astern of the main mast. At this point, two series of three dots from the main mast join the line of dots from the stern castle. The upper dot series is horizontal from a point on the main mast that is 28 cm above the main deck. The lower series angles upward, like a short spar, from a point on the mast 26 cm above the deck. Taken together, the three lines of dots suggest a gaff-rigged main sail. A gaff rigged main sail is marked by a spar anchored to the main mast, controlled by upper lines from the mast with a long line (or sail edge) to the stern castle. A fourth series of more shallowly pecked dots, more distinct on the photograph than on the surface print, initiates from a point on the mast just below the main stays and curves upward towards the juncture point of the three series of dots just described. This last series may represent the upper edge of the sail. There were no dots indicating a lower edge to the sail. However, on illustrations of ships of the period, the lower edge of a single mainsail, whether held out by a gaff spar or a longer oblique sprit sail pole, is loose footed and often obscure (Fig. 4). Relating the 62.46 Ship Petroglyph to Illustrations of Ships of the Period In general, the hull profile of the petroglyph ship image is characteristic of larger sailing vessels, particularly warships and large merchantmen, from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries. However, details in the length and height of the stern castle, the profile of the stern (and rudder) and size or shape of the beak help limit the probable period of construction of the vessel represented to the last quarter of the sixteenth century through the first half of the seventeenth century. There are good matches for the superstructure in English, Dutch and Flemish galleons constructed between 1585 and 1590 (Lundstrom</page><page sequence="7">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 7 1961:1 19-125), all of which are marked by forecastles set back from the bow, curved up beaks and bowsprits which rise forward and out from the forecastle. On these large, three-masted ships, de- tails of the stern castle, hull and rigging differ from those of a single masted vessel. Perhaps the best over-all match among the illustrations in the sources consulted is a smaller ship, called the Cromster by the Dutch, with a main mast and smaller mizzen, a fore-stay sail and sprit-sails from the main and mizzen masts (Culver 1935:104-106). In this variety (Figure 4), a ship used in Eliza- Figure 5. Sketch of sails and rigging for single masted Dutch Jachts, c.l 630 A.D. After Lundstrom, 1961. 314. bethan England and the Netherlands into the beginning of the seventeenth century, the rounded hull had a sharply raked stern castle that extended forward somewhat less than half the length of the main deck. The short, turned-up beak that gave the Cromster its Dutch name (from cromsteven - a bent or crooked stem) is much closer to the beak represented in the petroglyph than to the far more elaborate beaks featured on larger ships of the period. Small and medium Dutch vessels with fore-and-aft spritsails and a forestay sail were the rule, at the end of the sixteenth century (Lundstrom 1961 : 126). Such coastal vessels required smaller crews, were the rule. These continued to be developed into the seventeenth century, evolving into single-masted swift-sailing vessels calledyac/zte, used as a scout and a dispatch boat. Before the middle of the seventeenth century, on the jachts, the fore-and-aft spritsail (Figure 5 left) had been replaced by a more easily managed gaff-rig main (Figure 5 right), a sail spread by a spar anchored to a single main mast just below the stays (Lundstrom 1961:314). The single mast, series of dots from the mast suggestive of a gaff rig, and over-all hull profile reminiscent of a Dutch Cromster suggest a probable construction date sometime after the beginning of the seventeenth century, but before the middle of the century, for a ship with the features indicated on the petroglyph at 62.46. Two Other European Ship Petroglyphs at Machias Bay Ship petroglyphs were recorded at two other sites in Machias Bay. At site 62.47, a little east of site 62.46, a fragmentary ship retains the pecked silhouette of the hull from amidships, below the mast to the stern, also delineating the single mast and parts of the rigging. Parts of the stern and deck have spalled off. Visible parts of this fragmentary petroglyph are identical to the complete image at site 62.46, and both petroglyphs may refer to the same vessel. The most significant feature of the 62.47 ship image fragment is its placement on a surface with moose images above and below, an association that indicates that petroglyphs of moose were made during the same time period. The smaller ship petroglyph at 62. 1 (Figure 6), also on a surface surrounded by moose forms, is unique in several details, including direct association with a Christian cross, elements of Algonkian symbolic language (discussed below) and structural features. The cross limits the probable country of origin to one of the Catholic kingdoms such as France, Spain or Portugal. A detailed description follows. The small ship image at 62.1 differs from the larger image at 62.46 in several significant details. The hull silhouette (9 cm long) follows the standard profile for ships of the period with a high poop and a forecastle that ends short of the beak, but the beak is quite thick with a short turn upward. No bowsprit is visible. The main mast is relatively short (6 cm) and thick (1 cm) with a single square sail connected to the deck by thin pecked lines. There is no visible mizzen mast. A short diagonal line from the stern might</page><page sequence="8">8 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 6. Petroglyph of a French (?) pinnace with a square sail, large cross and parallel arcs. Site 62.1, Area A. represent a tiller. Two well dinted parallel arcs rise upward from points below and behind the ship's hull. The arcs describe a quarter circle and enter the ship's hull at the waterline and just below the bulwark. A short distance (3 cm) in front of the bow of the ship is a large pecked cross about 1 0 cm high by 7 cm across, larger, in fact, than the ship image itself. The Christian cross, parallel arcs and the ship show sim- ilar fine, shallow pecking and patination and appear to have been made at the same time. The parallel arcs and the cross do not represent structural fea- tures of the ship and are discussed and interpreted below. In addition, there are two short grooves forward of the mast and above the square sail that suggest a long pole or spar used to spread a spritsail. However, the two short lines do not display the weathering or pecking characteristic of the main design. These short lines are probably pre-existing glacial striata and are not considered here as features of the ship represented. DOCUMENTED EUROPEAN VOYAGES TO THE MACHIAS BAY AREA A review of historical accounts of European voyages from the sixteenth through the first half of the seventeenth century shows that documented voyages to Machias Bay fall into two periods when French or English vessels are likely to have visited during the first half of the seventeenth century (Bourque and Whitehead 1985; Bradley 1985; Burrage 1914; Drisko 1904; Levermore 1912; Morison 1972; Weise 1884). The earliest may have occurred between 1604 and 1606 when Sieur de Monts, with Champlain as his lieutenant and cartographer, explored the coast from the St. Croix River southward as far as Cape Cod. They sought potential settlement locations that were more amenable than their initial (1604) wintering site at the mouth of the St. Croix River. Champlain, who was a meticulous draftsman, made charts of the coast and all suitable harbors he visited (Morison 1 972). Machias Bay is not among them, and Champlain may never have visited the upper reaches of the bay. However, de Monts and Champlain also operated independently. The petroglyph representation of a small, single-masted vessel with a square sail associated with a large Christian cross before the bow at site 62. 1 may refer to a separate visit by de Monts at about this time. Drisko ( 1 904), a local historian of Machias, states that de Monts did make a trading voyage to the mouth of the Machias River around this time, though I have yet to locate a primary source for this assertion. We have good documentation for one or more visits by early English colonial traders that would correspond to the dates ascribed to the apparent features of the ship images at sites 62.46 and 62.47.</page><page sequence="9">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 9 According to an entry in Bradford's Journal in 1630 (Bradford 1952), a former Plymouth Colony member named Isaac Allerton formed a partnership with Richard Vines, a trader established at Richmond Island in Casco Bay, to set up a trading venture east of the Penobscot River, where the Plymouth Colony had a trading post. The two entrepreneurs obtained capital and apparently a ship or ships in England. The siting of their trading post in Machias Bay amounted to a direct challenge to the French who were in the process of reasserting their claims to Acadia following a hiatus in their colonizing efforts. Machias Bay was in the area of the coast extending as far as the Penobscot River that the French claimed as a part of Acadia. Presumably the trading partners needed to go further east than the already established Plymouth Colony post at Castine (Pentagoet). The 1 630 reference in Bradford's Jo urnal suggests that preliminary scouting and trading visits may have been made to Machias before they attempted to set up a post, complete with small cannons, supplies and a truck house, somewhere within present day Machiasport. In 1633, within a few days of the post being set up, however, the personnel were surprised and captured with all their assets by the French under Charles de St. Etienne de La Tour, and the venture ended (Drisko 1904; Faulkner and Faulkner 1987). Later, de La Tour's rival in the Gulf of Maine, Charles Menou d'Aulney, attacked and took over the Plymouth Colony post at Pentagoet (Burrage 1914). The sudden end to the English trading ventures at Machias and Castine marked the beginning of bitter conflict between the French and English colonies that did not end until the final English triumph in the middle of the eighteenth century. During that time, the area of Machias was essentially a no-man's land under nominal French control, but subject to punitive raids by English colonists intended to discourage French settlement in the area and to harass their Native American allies. The Native American populations suffered a series of epidemics of European introduced diseases as well. During periods of active hostilities, those who did not flee to the Mission of St. Francis near Quebec were vulnerable to capture and enslavement, or killing (Bourque 1989). At intervals of peace through this period, the Passamaquoddy/Malecite or Etchemin, as they were then known, probably continued to utilize the Machias Bay area as they had in the past. An eyewitness account, dating from about 1 790, testifies that the seasonally dispersed groups still gathered annually in the fall along the mainland bordering the estuary of the Machias River for night-long ceremonies (Drisko 1 904). Following the end of the Revolutionary War, the Machias area was rapidly settled. The Passamaquoddy/Malecite, under terms of a treaty dictated by Massachusetts authorities in 1794, gave up all but 23,000 acres in Maine and were based on reservations further east on the St. Croix River watershed. While some Passamaquoddy families continued to live and visit in the area, the effective end of Native American petroglyph making on the four mainland sites (62. 1 , 62.6, 62.8 and 62. 1 1 ) probably occurred with the European settlement of Machiasport. The isolated situation of sites 62.46 and 62.47, however, off an island in the bay that was not attractive for settlement, may have allowed the continued visits by canoe-based Native Americans at later dates. This possibility is supported by the nature of some of the most recent petroglyphs at 62.46. EUROPEAN SHIP PETROGLYPHS AND NATIVE AMERICAN POINTS OF VIEW The technical features of the ship petroglyphs and the historical context sketched above give a basis for dating the making of the ship designs to the first half of the seventeenth century. The question that should be asked, in the context of the shaman's practice of making petroglyphs, is why were they made? Can we obtain insights about the effects on Native Americans of these early encounters? Is there a change in the nature of petroglyph designs in Machias Bay around the time of contact with Europeans? We obtained partial answers all these questions by a study of designs associated with the ship images; a review of the evidence that suggests sequential use of some surfaces, and an analysis of the changes in subjects and treatment indicated by the sequences in designs.</page><page sequence="10">1 0 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 7. Detail of Kennebec River ledge, site 69.4, showing a petroglyph of post and beam structure with parallel arcs into the gable roof. The ship image on the mainland site of 62.1 appears near the upper edge of a mas- sive ledge, exposed for about 20 meters, that has petroglyphs from its lower tip to within four meters of the present eroding shoreline. The ship image is sur- rounded by a variety of moose representations. Moose forms do not appear in Machias Bay petroglyphs before Style 6, the last period of Native American activity at the site (Hed- den 1996). The appearance of moose representations in Machias Bay petroglyphs coincides with colder, wetter conditions, leading to coastal spruce forest that is attractive to moose (Spiess 1993). The relatively few earlier game animal representations identified in the Machias Bay Petroglyph Tradition at mainland sites are smaller with narrow bodies, and some are depicted in a leaping posture typical of white-tailed deer (Hedden 1984). None of the petroglyphs that may include deer representations date later than Style 5, including a single example from site 62.46 (Ledge 1 , Panel 1 0). Moose representations are not evident in the petroglyphs before Style 6 and become dominant through the Contact period. Deer representations were completely absent from the Style 6 subject inventory. In addition to the large Christian cross and the details of sail and hull already described, the ship features two parallel arcs which rise up from behind and below the ship and enter the hull before petering out. The curve of the arcs describe a quarter circle, making an interpretation of them as anchors or sweep oars unconvincing (Whittall 1988). Alternately, however, the arcs can be read as sign language. A similar set of arcs is associated with a representation of a framed post and beam structure at Maine petroglyph site 69.4 on the Kennebec River (Figure 7). The structure at site 69.4 probably represents a chapel built at Old Point in Norridgewock for the Jesuit Father Rasles in 1 722 (see endnote 2) . Parallel arcs that rise and descend to describe a half circle above the horizon are a recognized sign in the pictography of other Algonkian groups. Among the Ojibway on the Great Lakes, such parallel arcs have been interpreted as the mountain a shaman ascends in his vision quest to receive power from a celestial or sky spirit (Hoffman 1888; Rajnovich 1994). A figure said to represent a manitou or spirit of the sky is sometimes represented at the top of the parallel arcs. The shaman completes his quest by returning to the plane of earth at the base of the arcs and shares his received powers in the service of his people. In the ship image, the Christian cross floats before the bow. The ascending arcs describe a quarter circle and end in the hull. Thus, in contrast to the rainbow half-circle of the traditional sign language motif, the arc of the 62.1 sign is incomplete and suggests that there is no return to the plane of earth, no descent from the spirit world above! Is this a wry comment on Christian dogma in Native American sign language? The maker of the petroglyph seems to have understood that the people in the ship believed that the ascent to the spirit world is only achieved through certain rites of the church and then only after physical death. The same arrangement of arcs appears at site 69.4 in a petroglyph that probably dates over a century later. Here the two arcs are connected by ladder-like rungs. The arcs end at the gable roof of the post and beam structure which, we suggest, represents Father Rasle's chapel (Fig. 7).</page><page sequence="11">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 1 1 The two larger vessel petroglyphs represented on the island sites were not directly associated with a cross or other sign language motifs. The undamaged complete ship form at 62.46, however, is associated with an inactive anthropomorph, peripherally located about 30 cm above the stern of the vessel. The simplified human figure is depicted at an oblique angle, a sign that nominally indicates sleep or death. The proximity of the sign suggests a connection to the ship image. Following conventions that are present throughout all periods of the prehistoric Machias Bay Petroglyph Tradition, the oblique figure can be read as the visionary shaman. In this convention, the inactive anthropomorph may be isolated or may be associated with a variety of other figures or game animals. The associated figures may refer to figures in visions to whom the shaman credits his powers or to the demonstrations of these powers (i.e., a successful hunt) . For example, one direct reference we have from an ethnographic source in the Great Lakes area describes the making of an historic painting or petroglyph by an Algonkian shaman (Rajnovich 1 988). The rock painting celebrated a successful conclusion to a cure and served to commemorate the aid of the spirits, believed to dwell within the rocks, which the Ojibway called Maymaygwashi. In the case of site 62.46, the desired event envisioned by the shaman and commemorated by the petroglyph may have been the (return?) visit of a trading vessel. The absence of a cross suggests the visitors were not French. The visible structural features of the ship are consistent with the period of the documented visit (or visits?) of Allerton and Vines between 1630 and 1633. THE SHIP IMAGES IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER CONTACT PERIOD PETROGLYPHS AT MACHIAS BAY A review of the prehistoric sequence of styles in the Machias Bay Petroglyph Tradition will help to clarify how the imagery and subjects in the petrogyphs changed after European contact (Hedden 1996). In a sequence of five style periods, beginning in Machias Bay an estimated 3000 years ago, anthropomorphic figures dominate the petroglyph panels. Attributes of posture, outline, interior detail, and head identify these figures as visionary shamans. Placement on a surface, size, associated figures and sign language conventions help to delineate the role of these figures, a role which changes over time. The start of Style 6 is marked by the dominance of moose representations and continues through contact with Europeans. Briefly summarized, the earliest designs, Style 1, feature paired figures. One of the pairs, a headless anthropomorph, stands on the left side of an anthropomorph with a V-shaped head. The passive posture, rudimentary arms and legs and the outlined torso of both figures is consistent with a visionary experience. The Passamaquoddy name for a shaman, rnedeau 'lin, derives from the word for something with a hollow body. The headless figure follows sign language conventions for someone dead or a spirit. The V-shaped headdress on the adjacent figure may signify horns and/or the ability to receive spirits or both. The headdress identifies the shaman, who, possessed of a head, speaks for the spirits he encounters in his vision. The next three styles are variations and developments on this basic theme depicting relationships of shaman with spiritual entities. In Style 2, shaman and spirit entity are combined in a single figure with two arms, a common outlined torso from which four legs emerge. In Style 3, the inclusion of one or more spirit entities within the shaman is signified by doubled or tripled torso lines which continue to the legs in an overall ghostlike configuration. Hands, feet or other normal human attributes are not depicted. In Style 4, the shaman figure remains passive but is elongated and may wear an elaborate headdress that suggests antlers. Associated spirit figures are now shown as separate entities. These associated spirits are reduced in size and differentiated from the shaman visionary by sign language attributes that indicate activity, such as linear feet oriented in a single direction and arms that curve and join at the hips to form an oval, a sign for a full belly and a reference to the power of the spirits to supply food through hunting success. This stylistic development appears near the middle of the 1st Millennium A.D. The distinction in size and the separation between the large passive shaman figure and the small active spirit figures suggests a subordination of at</page><page sequence="12">1 2 Archaeology of Eastern North America least some spirit entities to the will of the shaman, serving as familiars. Such spirit familiars were said to have served reputed Maine shamans into the nineteenth century (Eckstorm 1945). The size and elaborate headdress of the Style 4 shaman figures also seems to reflect an enhanced social status for the shaman. Style 5 marks the change from an entirely passive role for the shaman representations to active postures. The active postures are stylized gestures which can be interpreted as elements in a sign language vocabulary present in Algonkian rock art in Canada and which have been interpreted by native informants (Rajnovich 1994). For example, arms bent at the elbows and extended may be read as conveying gifts. One arm extended upward and/or the other downward may signify the location of the source(s) of the shaman's spiritual powers. Hands held to the ears may assert the shaman's ability to hear what goes on at great distances. Linear feet, both oriented in the same direction, indicate motion, walking, a traveler. These active gestures are accompanied by pecked out (i.e., solid) body forms, semi-naturalistic shaping of arms and legs, detailed appendages, such as hands and feet and active positions, in effect representations of a person as a normal physical presence. One figure at site 62.8 depicts a naturalistic deer with human legs and feet, possibly a shaman masquerading as a deer. These active figures largely, but not entirely, supplant the older convention of passive shaman forms. I have interpreted this introduction of active shaman forms as relating to a change or accretion in the variety of the shaman's performances (Hedden 1996). The earlier passive forms may refer to the "Shaking Tent" performance, where the shaman, while hidden from his audience, in the dark of night, behind a circular bark-covered enclosure, invokes and talks to his spirit helpers. The later active or gesturing figures may refer to the development of day time public performances along the lines of organized ceremonials involving several shamans, known historically as Midewewin among the Chippewa and Ojibway groups of the Great Lakes area along with another or variant group of shamans called Wabeno who performed only at night (Rajnovich 1994; Hoffman 1888; Dewdney 1975; Schoolcraft 1854-7). The nature of such performances among Maine Native Americans is not documented beyond vague references to all night "hullaballoos" at Machias Bay (Drisko 1904) and secret gatherings of shamans to demonstrate their powers (Speck 1920). As Styles 5 and 6 are represented at the new sites under discussion, the narrative of subsequent changes in the nature of the imagery can be followed out in examples of petroglyphs recorded at site 62.46 and 62.47. EXAMPLES OF THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS AT SITES 62.46 AND 62.47 In this section two panels are described in detail and analyzed to demonstrate the methodology followed to develop the sequence of petroglyphs. The remaining panels are summarized in Table 1. At site 62.47 Panel 3, about one-third of the fragmentary petroglyph representation of a sailing vessel has spalled off along with most of the original surface above, below and to the stern (west) side (Figure 8). Two moose forms are associated on the same panel. One is about 10 cm above the bow of the ship and the other about 25 cm below. The pecking of the ship's hull, barely one millimeter in depth, is shallower and worn smoother than the pecking of the moose forms. The depths of the pecking on the moose are deeper by an additional 1 to 2 mm. These moose forms at 62.47 are smaller in size and more rudimentary in detail than the moose representations associated with the probable French vessel on the mainland site 62.1. Field observations indicated that the moose representations at 62.47 were additions to the panel at a point in time later than the ship image. If there had been an inactive dreamer figure associated with the fragmentary ship, the figure has been lost to the extensive spalling of the original surface around the ship. Panel 1 at 62.47 (Figure 9) is another example of a surface with a sequence of use beginning with the Contact period. More than one-third of the available surface area has spalled off. Of four designs on the panel, the two that are most shallow and exhibit the most damage from spalling consist of the hindquarters and most of the body of a large quadruped, and an inactive armless human figure or dreamer. Surviving details of the quadruped (e.g., the size, shape and emphasized body outline) match large moose representa-</page><page sequence="13">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 13 Table 1.

Near the lower section of Panel 1 is a much smaller bull moose which is more deeply pecked ( 1 -2 mm) and has not suffered from spalling. On the upper part of panel is a single figure in a canoe, more deeply pecked (2 mm) and also not affected by spalling. The canoe has a snake-like shape rising from one end; and the canoe and snake are continuous. This figure may represent the most recent aboriginal use of the panel. The petroglyph seems to refer to a water-monster, such as the horned snake or Appodumken, whose victims meet with disasters during travel on water. One incised Mic'maq petroglyph at Kejumkujik Lake, Nova Scotia, probably dating from the nineteenth century, shows a scene of a figure fallen from a canoe being taken off by a horned serpent (Molyneaux 1988). Table 1 summarizes similar descriptive data from 13 panels on ledges #1, #2, #6 and #7 at site 62.46 and four separate panels on Ledge #1 at site 62.47 in which the relative wear and surface position of the</page><page sequence="14">1 4 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 8. Site 62.47, Field sketch for Panel 3, showing a fragmentary ship. petroglyphs indicates a sequence of use over a period of time. Comparison with designs associated with the ship images and moose representations at sites 62.1 and site 62.47 indicate that most of the petroglyphs on the ledge were executed during and after direct European contact in Machias Bay. Site 62.46, however, has a substantial number (n=18) of prehistoric Style 5 petroglyphs. New Subjects That Indicate Changes in the Shaman's Role The forty-one petroglyphs with discernible design features from site 62.46 and the twelve described from site 62.47, show traits that begin to appear with the development of Styles 5 and 6 at other sites in Machias Bay (62. 1 , 62. 1 1 , 62.8 and 62.23). Distinc- tive Style 5 traits integrating signifi- cant gesture into active, fully detailed anthropomorphic forms have been described earlier. As represented at site 62.46, Style 5 can be separated into two phases: an earlier phase (5a) mark- ed by elongated, finely and fully pecked-out anthropomorphs with arms extended in one or another of the ges- tures described; and a later phase (5b) with dense, sharply pecked-out complexes of figures with a shaman anthropomorph at one end and a variety of spirit (?) figures to the left of the shaman. Style 5a petroglyphs are concentrated on badly spalled or fragmentary high flat surfaces on Ledge #2 and lower flat surfaces on Ledge #7. Style 5b figures appear along the lower portions of a series of slanted panels on the east face of Ledge #1, with later Style 6 designs on the upper parts of the same surfaces. Style Period 6 at site 62.46 is divisible into three phases marked by changes in subject, techniques, relative surface wear and location on a surface in relation to other designs. The earliest phase (6a) introduces a series of new subjects, including moose representations, stylized bear tracks, a sign identified as "heart" in the Great Lakes area (Rajnovich 1994), an anthropomorph between confronted moose (at site 62.1) and seventeenth century European sailing vessels. All of these figures were executed in the same dense pecking technique featured on Style 5 figures, with overlapping dints and rounded contours. Many of the designs have suffered fragmentation from spalling of the rock surface. Passive anthropomorphs interpreted as representations of the shaman/dreamer continue; but instead of being positioned as a subject visually larger or equal to other anthropomorphs or animals (interpreted as spirit entities), they are reduced in size and peripheral to the main subject. The main subjects are usually moose forms but, in one case, the inactive anthropomorph appears above a European sailing vessel. The bear tracks and "heart" with an arm attached to the left side and angled up are new signs to the Machias Bay Petroglyph Tradition which were important elements in historic mnenomic signs associated with the Midewewin iconography around the Great Lakes</page><page sequence="15">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 15 (Rajnovich 1994; Dewdney 1975). Initially during Style 6, the moose representations are large, often outlined with elaborate de- tail of antlers and other features. Site 62. 1 has the best examples of early Style 6 moose representa- tions, all restricted to the upper west end of the Main Ledge in Area A and Area B. Area A also includes a linear anthropomorph between an elaborate bull moose and a smaller female. The config- uration suggests that the linear anthropomorph should be inter- preted as a representation of the Master of Animals, a spirit be- lieved to have control over the supply of game animals. In the Northeast, this concept was re- ported for the Montaignais in Gaspe early in the seventeenth century ( Kenton 1927). A vari- ant of the same configuration with a more elaborate central anthropomorph has also been recorded at site 62.11, a short distance from 62.1. These fig- ures, and a few abbreviated moose attributed to Phase 6b, represent the last phase of activity at site 62. 1 and site 62. 1 1 . Phase 6b is marked by a reduction in size and detail of the moose forms. Body areas tend to be pecked out with paired antler and Figure 9. Site 62.47, Field sketch for Panel 1 with moose (?) fragment &amp; visionary shaman(?) and small solidly-pecked moose. Canoe figure with a snake-like extension at one end (upper right) may represent the most recent native petroglyphs added to Panel 1 . leg features abbreviated and consolidated to single forms. Moose forms generally appear without associated anthropomorphs though an occasional peripherally located inactive anthropomorph, interpreted as a shaman/dreamer, were recorded. Phase 6c features smaller anthropomorphs with raised arms and extended legs from slightly ovoid bodies (called Maymayguashi by Ojibway) which had been pecked with a blunt hammerstone and, perhaps, rubbed, producing a dish-shaped contour (Figure 10). This phase introduced a . number of new motifs, including canoes with linear occupants, an angular horned snake and bird figures that may relate to oral traditions concerning Glooskap or other cultural heros. Phase 6c traits are similar to the latest prehistoric or historic rock paintings of the Canadian Shield and Southwestern Maine (site 21.26). At site 62.46, Style 6c petroglyphs tend to be located on the upper edges of panels on Ledge #1 where Styles 5b-6a petroglyphs appear on central or lower exposures. Style 6b and 6c designs are deeper and generally show less erosion and weathering.</page><page sequence="16">1 6 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 10a. Site 62.46, Ledge 1, Panel 7.

CONTRIBUTION OF SITES 62.46 AND 62.47 TO THE MACHIAS BAY PETROGLYPH TRADITION Site 62.46, as an isolated island or ledge location, may differ in function from two mainland petroglyph ledge sites which also have Style 5a and 5b glyphs. Several of the Style 5 glyphs at the mainland sites of 62.1 (Area C) and 62.8 (NW ledge) depict, as described above, solidly pecked out active anthropomorphs who express through significant gestures particular powers they have received, as though they were participants in a public performance. Examples cited include one anthropomorph depicted squatting with elbows resting on knees and hands to his ears, as though listening intently, a sign for extraordinary hearing. Such demonstrations of extraordinary powers may have been an important component of public performances at seasonal gatherings when several shamans were present. Whether or not the interpretation given above is accurate, it is important to note that Style 5 at site 62.46 has the solidly pecked out figures with hand/arm gestures appropriate to indicating</page><page sequence="17">Contact Period Petroglyphs in Machias Bay, Maine 1 7 the sources of their power(s), but these are not shown in active movement demonstrating the nature of their power(s), as might happen in a public performance. What we do see on the island ledges are the identifying traits of Style 5, such as solidly pecked figures, gestures, unidirectional feet, but not the public performance aspects. The absence of performance gestures may indicate that the petroglyph makers on site 62.46 remained focused on memorializing a successful spirit encounter. While site 62.46 does not offer examples of all the stylistic periods identified at other sites, the sample recorded is consistent with the sequence of styles established earlier for Machias Bay (Hedden 1996). The sample increases the variety of forms for the two most recent periods of Native American petroglyph activity in Machias Bay and enables a better definition of sub-phases in the style periods. Perhaps most significantly, the Style 6 designs at both sites suggest that the making of petroglyphs by Native Americans in Machias Bay continued through the Contact period and into the historic period, up to post-Revolutionary settlement of Machias and, perhaps, into the nineteenth century. During this time, a significant diminution in the size and detail of anthropomorphs that formerly represented the shaman/dreamer occurs. There is also a restriction in subjects associated with the dreamer, from a variety of figures that may express spiritual entities to a nearly exclusive preoccupation with moose representations. Distinct new configurations appear that may refer to historic Native American oral traditions that have been recorded in Jesuit Relations and ethnographic accounts. Circumstantial evidence for the continuation of petroglyph making through the Contact and early historic periods is established by the association of seventeenth century ships with Style 6a images and is implied by changes in other subjects represented. The isolated European ship image at 62.46 is associated with a traditional anthropomorph which may or may not be contemporary. At 62.47 a fragmentary petroglyph depicts another version of the same vessel or a similar ship. This ship image is located on a middle elevation between two associated but more complete moose representations. While this conjunction indicates the ship and moose forms belong, more or less, to the same style period, detailed analysis of the surface, execution, and relative weathering of all designs on the surface, as described in two examples above, places the abbreviated moose later (Style 6b). On the other hand, a large fragment of a moose (?) on Panel 1 at 62.47, shares identical details with Style 6a moose representations at 62.1, where a smaller ship associated with a Christian cross also appears. Smaller and less elaborate moose representations (6b) have been recorded on isolated high mainland surfaces (Site 62.1 1, 62.6). These moose forms tend to be concentrated near the highest edges of the patinated areas of exposed ledge rock. Colonial settlement in the Machias Bay area could not begin until the conflict with the French ended (1756). According to early accounts, the first settlers in Machias from Scarborough, Maine, in 1763 "supposed they were under the French flag, and the doubt was not wholly removed until the surrender of Cornwallis at the close of the Revolution.... "(Drisko 1904:4). The subsequent post-Revolutionary War influx of settlers apparently put an end to the early autumn annual gatherings of Passamaquoddies. Following the Treaty of 1 794 with the Massachusetts State government, the Passamaquoddy Nation was effectively moved into reservations along the St. Croix River. The Native American making of petroglyphs in Machias Bay probably continued through most of the eighteenth century but, given the post-Revolutionary War settlement activity, we are unsure how much longer petroglyph activity may or could have continued beyond that date. None of the mainland sites (62.1, 62.6, 62.8 and 62.1 1) show the motifs attributed to Style 6c on the island ledges of site 62.46 (for example, possible "Maymaygwayshi" figures with raised arms, canoe figures that may refer to oral traditions ), which would suggest that all Native American activity on the mainland sites was abandoned by the time of the 1 794 Treaty. However, the isolated situation of site 62.46 may have allowed some later seasonal Passamaquoddy visits to the Machias area and the island sites well into the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="18">1 8 Archaeology of Eastern North America CONCLUSIONS The changes in the character of petroglyphs at 62.46 between Styles 5b and 6 have significant and profound implications for our understanding of the impact of the European invasion on Native American societies, speaking, in particular, of those groups who continued to visit Machias Bay up to the end of the eighteenth century. Style 6 in Machias Bay is marked by diminished anthropomorphic figures, usually in linear form, and a strong, often exclusive emphasis on moose representations, The active detailed gesturing anthropomorphs we have identified with shamans in public performance are no longer depicted on the mainland petroglyph sites. In effect, following European contact, the demonstrative or performance aspect of the dreamer/shamans role disappears from petroglyph representations. During and following the period of European contact (Style 6a and 6b), possibly through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the portrayed role of the inactive (shaman/dreamer) anthropomorphs in the petroglyphs seems to be restricted to assisting in the moose hunt. In the Machias Bay area, portrayals of the visionary shaman function in association with moose representations most likely ended with the 1 794 Treaty. Some Native American use of the island sites of 62.46 and 62.47 may have continued into the early nineteenth century (Style 6c) with petroglyph subjects that suggest that the shaman/glyph maker limited his concerns to curing with the aid of spirits and, perhaps, spiritual protection from the marine hazards of canoe travel. ENDNOTES 1 The dating of the prehistoric petroglyph styles (Styles 1 through 5) is based on field observations that the petroglyphs could not have been made before the ledge surfaces had been cleared of glacial till. The till was composed of sand, gravel and large boulders and ranged from 2 to 7 meters in thickness. The ledge surfaces were cleared naturally by rising sea-level and storm-tides. The six petroglyph styles defined were based on formal attribute changes in anthropomorphic forms representing the visionary shaman and his spirit sources of power. Surfaces with Style 1 petroglyphs were found to have the lowest set of elevations and were consistently located the furthest distance from the uneroded shore. Surfaces with Style 2 were slightly higher and closer to shore and so forth. Each successive style may appear on surfaces containing earlier styles but they are either peripherally located on the surface or, in a few instances, superimposed over an earlier design. The Style 6 ship petroglyphs were placed at or near the highest ledge surfaces utilized for petroglyphs. The rate of sea-level rise, rapid during the early Holocene, slowed markedly between 3000 and 2000 years BP before resuming a higher rate in the Machias Bay area in 1 870, now estimated to be about 1 cm/yr (Belknap et al. 1 989). In the Machias Bay area, local tectonic shifts have added an unpredictable element to determining the how sea level rise at the petroglyph sites varied from the general average along the Maine coast. The relative condition of the petroglyphs themselves offers clues to the local rate of sea level rise. Petroglyphs on surfaces that were regularly covered by the daily tides seem to have suffered less from frost damage caused by spalling from ice freezing in the crevices. Thus, a fast rate of sea level rise is inferred for surfaces with Styles 1 and 2 which, where they appear, are relatively well preserved. Style 3 petroglyphs, estimated to date from about 2000 years BP, on the other hand, show the most marked signs of damage from ice-induced spalling. Examples of Styles 4 (ca. 1500 years BP) and 5 (ca. 1000 years BP) are in progressively better shape (See also Hedden 1996). 2The petroglyph ledge depicting a post and beam frame structure at site 69.4 is not far upstream from Father Rasles Jesuit mission at Old Point. In a 1 722 letter to his brother in France Father Rasles expressed his pride in his last chapel, a fine building constructed by a carpenter named Jabez Bradbury, hired from the New England colonies by the Norridgewocks (Eckstorm 1939).
