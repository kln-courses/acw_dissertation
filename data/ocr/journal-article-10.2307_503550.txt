<plain_text><page sequence="1">Silver and Lead in Prepalatial Crete KEITH BRANIGAN Dr. Renfrew has recently published a compre- hensive (but not complete) catalogue of Cycladic metalwork, including many pieces of either silver or lead,' and the present writer has presented a detailed study of Early Minoan copper and bronze working.2 As a complementary study to both of these publications it is intended to present here a discussion of the use of silver and lead in prepala- tial Crete, and to attempt to place the pattern of metallurgy in Crete in its wider Aegean context. The first two sections of the paper are concerned with the former point, while the third section-- dealing with the distribution and dating of the finds-paves the way for the fourth and fifth sec- tions which are concerned with the wider, Aegean, context of the finds and with the sources of raw materials. A catalogue of the extant silver and lead objects of prepalatial date is appended.3 The metallurgical and cultural background re- quires but a brief description. As I have shown elsewhere, copper and bronze working in Early Bronze Age Crete were relatively inventive and productive. There are good reasons for supposing that the working of copper began in the first phase of the period (EM I), and that there was a notable influx of metallurgical ideas from the eastern Medi- terranean in EM III.P At this time too the Minoan coppersmiths may have begun to seek supplies of raw materials from abroad, rather than rely on their own rather meagre supplies of copper.5 East- ern influence on Minoan culture as a whole per- haps becomes more marked from EM III onwards, in contrast to the more "Aegean" character of EM I and II culture. In the north particularly these earlier phases of the Early Bronze Age had re- vealed cultural affinities to the rest of the Aegean and to the Cyclades in particular.6 Yet throughout the Early Bronze Age Crete shows an individuality which she had possessed during most of the Neo- lithic era and which she was to maintain for most of the remainder of the Bronze Age. EARLY MINOAN ARTIFACTS OF SILVER AND LEAD The Early Minoan artifacts of silver and lead are fewer in number but generally similar in type to artifacts manufactured of these metals in the Cycla- des, Troad and on the mainland of Greece during the Early Bronze Age. Most of the objects are jewelry of one kind or another, and two small ves- sels are known. The latter are both small bowls or cups, one made of silver and found in tomb VI at Mochlos, the other made of lead and found in the cave at Trapeza.' The lead vessel from Trapeza was of the simplest design, but the silver cup from Mochlos was apparently decorated around its lower half with beading. Seven silver bangles or rings have been found in Early Bronze Age contexts in Crete, and between them they represent most of the range of similar objects found elsewhere in the Aegean. Two curl rings were found at Ayios An- doni, a simple finger-ring at Amnisos, two rings with bezels were discovered at Krasi and Mochlos (tomb XIV), and two silver bangles were associ- ated with the ring from Krasi.8 All of these were made of silver wire or a narrow, flattened strip of silver. The only two silver pins found in Early Minoan deposits, at Platanos and Porti,' were made 1 C. Renfrew, "Cycladic Metallurgy and the Aegean Early Bronze Age" AIA 71 (1967) Iff.

Two tiny spheres surmounted by crosses (not unlike an orb in appearance) found in tomb VI at Mochlos are almost certainly ear-ring pend- ants, and a similar use may be confidently postu- lated for two small items found at Krasi, one made of lead and the other of silver.'0 The silver piece is made in a form rather like a sycamore seed, with two "wings," and has a suspension hole through its head. The lead pendant takes the form of a single-axe or scraper, and may perhaps have been thought to possess talismanic qualities." In this respect it is perhaps closely related to two other small pendants of lead, found at Mochlos, which are both in the form of a double-axe."2 There may also be some relationship to the small scraper made of silver found at Trapeza,13 characteristic of north Cretan scrapers in having only one rivet.'4 The only silver bead found in Crete is a broken exam- ple from Krasi, bi-conical in shape and made from sheet silver.'" The remaining objects are all rather exceptional pieces, though not without Aegean parallels. A sil- ver dagger found at Ghalania Kharakia"6 belongs to my type LD.VIII, featuring straight edges, a straight heel with four rivets, and a high mid-rib." Its proportions show it to be a typical dagger of this type, but for the material of which it is made. Equally impressive, but with no copper parallels, is an object of uncertain purpose found at Amni- sos.8 It is made of thick silver sheet and in shape bears some resemblance to the very stylized mar- ble figurines characteristic of the eastern Aegean and the western coast of Anatolia."9 There is a hole in the centre of the "head" and another in the centre of the "stomach," possibly representative of the navel. Above and on either side of both of these holes are punched depressions. The plaque therefore has the appearance of a very schematic rendering of the human head and torso and may indeed be comparable to the marble figurines from the eastern Aegean. Nevertheless the two holes suggest that, whatever it may have represented, this piece could have been used as a decorative plaque sewn onto an item of clothing. Krasi pro- duced four thin silver discs, each perforated with two holes, and a similar object was found at Ayios Andoni, all of which were apparently intended for use in this way.20 There can be no doubt as to the intended function of a lead figurine and a frag- ment of a lead plaque reputedly found near Herak- lion.21 Evans had serious doubts as to the au- thenticity of these two pieces,22 principally because they bear a remarkable resemblance to a large ser- pentine mould found at Selendj.23 The connection cannot be disputed, nor the possibility that "some Levantine dealer may have profited by the exist- ence of the mould to cast some lead figures from it,"24 yet the appearance of a very similar figurine in Schliemann's excavations at Troy must to some extent lessen the potency of these charges.25 Both the Cretan and the Trojan examples illustrate a female figure with clear Syrian and Mesopotamian connections. The rounded face, almond eyes, and heavy, pouting lips immediately recall the typical features of the Hurrians as portrayed in the art of Syria, and to this region too we may probably ascribe the superimposed cross motif on the lead plaque.26 The ringlets of hair on the other hand point to a Mesopotamian origin, and the accom- panying male figure on the Selendj mould wears a dress which must also be traced to Mesopotamia. The final silver object in the catalogue is a small "pestle" found at Amnisos.27 As with the other objects found here, no scale is given, but to judge from the ring which appears in the same photo- graph this "pestle" is probably a silver rivet from a razor or dagger.

The somewhat similar daggers from Koumasa have not been included in the catalogue of objects because I have argued at length elsewhere that they are Italian rather than Minoan.28 Equally the cata- logue does not include any of the silver cups from the Tod treasure, nor either of the two silver ves- sels from Byblos which have previously been as- signed to a Minoan origin."29 With the exception of the small silver cup from Mochlos there is noth- ing to suggest that the Minoans of the prepalatial era were either in the habit of, or used to manu- facturing silver vessels of high quality. Technically the Tod cups would be more at home in the Cycla- des or Troad, where silver and gold vessels are more common and more sophisticated, and these areas too provide ceramic parallels to the Tod shapes, albeit in less abundance. Finally it should also be emphasized that the bulk of the silver ves- sels in the Tod treasure have no good parallels in either metal or clay in Crete, and that the treasure is dated to Ammenemes II which places it at the end of the MM Ia phase in the palaces. Thus, while not prepared to support Schachermeyr's hypothesis that the vessels are Anatolian,30 I think their Mino- an origin is by no means proven. Similarly the two silver vessels from Byblos are attributed to a Minoan source on flimsy grounds.31 The spiral decoration on the one could perhaps be indicative of an Aegean origin but is indecisive, while the "teapot" shape of the other, although paralleled in Crete in EM II and in a rather different form in EM III-MM II, is itself found in the Levant in the Early Bronze/Middle Bronze transitional period (sometimes called MB I or Intermediate)."2 A Cre- tan origin need not therefore be sought for it. The picture of Minoan silver working which would seem to emerge from this paper is at variance from that which would emerge if the Tod and Byblos vessels were identified as Cretan, and in our pres- ent state of knowledge it seems prudent to support the picture which is authenticated rather than that which might prove to be a fraud. OTHER USES OF SILVER AND LEAD IN EARLY BRONZE AGE CRETE Renfrew has drawn attention to the many exam- ples of Cycladic and Helladic pottery vessels which have been mended with lead,33 yet not a single example of this usage is known from Crete. Apart from the production of the artifacts mentioned above the only use to which lead seems to have been put was as a deliberate alloy in the manu- facture of copper objects. Seven examples of this have so far been recognized in a total of 70 Early Minoan metal objects analyzed.34 Five of these objects were "triangular" daggers and two were long daggers of a typologically early class.35 All seven objects were found in vaulted tombs in the Mesara. In the same group of 70 artifacts which were analyzed, Junghans found four which contained a significant amount of silver, probably added de- liberately to the copper.36 Two of the objects were again "triangular" daggers, while the other two were long daggers. There was one further use to which silver was put in Early Minoan Crete and that was for the manufacture of rivets. Apart from the rivets on the silver dagger from Ghalania Kha- rakia four copper daggers are extant with silver rivets in the heel."3 The use of silver for such a purely functional purpose, and indeed its use as an occasional alloy, suggests that the Minoans may perhaps have had easier access to silver than the relative paucity of silver and lead artifacts in Early Minoan Crete would lead us to assume. This is the case in the Cyclades too, although there a greater proportion of lead and silver artifacts have survived. 28 K.

It will be seen that all of the lead artifacts appear in north- ern Crete, in the area between Heraklion and Mochlos. The only appearance of lead in the Me- sara is where it is a deliberate addition to the cop- per used in the manufacture of the seven daggers discussed above. Silver finds are similarly scarce in the Mesara, the only artifacts being the two silver pins from Platanos and Porti. The only other ap- pearances of silver in the Mesara are three daggers with silver rivets and another with a significant silver content. To the east of the Mesara was found the silver dagger of type VIII. The remainder of the silver artifacts are all to be found in the same northern area as that which yielded the lead ob- jects. There is thus a clear preponderance of silver and lead artifacts in the north of Crete and in the Gulf of Mirabello. This is in marked contrast to the distribution of copper objects, about two-thirds of which are found in the south of the island.38 The dating of these silver and lead artifacts is in many instances imprecise, the associated material being a disturbed deposit covering the whole of the Early Bronze Age. There are some welcome excep- tions, however. The material in tomb VI at Moch- los, from which came the two ear-ring pendants and the silver bowl, would seem to be of EM II- EM III date, and the material in tomb II on the same site, in which were found the two lead dou- ble-axe pendants, may be assigned to the same period. Similarly the few finds made in the de- posit at Ayios Andoni suggest that the two silver coil rings and the silver disc attachment from there should also belong to the period EM II-III. Unlike most of the finds from Trapeza the lead bowl oc- curred in a small pocket of material, the latest of which is of EM III date. Finally, the silver dagger from Ghalania Kharakia is reported as having oc- curred in EM III-MM Ia associations; this is in keeping with the dating of copper examples of dag- gers of type LD.VIII.9 The remainder of the items can only be dated on typological grounds or by citing close parallels from dateable deposits. In the cave at Amnisos from which came the silver "pestle," "figurine" plaque, and a coil ring, the pottery covered the whole of the Early Minoan era and also included some LM IB sherds. Larnax fragments from this de- posit may well be of EM III or MM Ia date as elsewhere in the north in cave burials.4" The "figurine" plaque might be tentatively attributed to EM II by reason of its similarity to some of the stylized marble figurines of the eastern Aegean, but the silver rivet would appear to be too large for an Early Minoan dagger rivet,41 in so far as we can judge its size. It might however have come 38 Branigan 52. 39 Branigan 15. 40 E.g. Pyrgos. S. Xanthoudides, "Megas Protominoikos Taph- os, Pyrgos," Deltion 4 (1918) i36ff. 41 Branigan 46. KEY * SLVR ARTIFACTs.

The silver scraper from Tra- peza, found in a very mixed deposit of Minoan material, is most unlikely to be later than MM Ia42 and could be as early as EM II. In the primitive tholos at Krasi, the nine silver objects and one of lead all turned up at the "deepest levels" according to the excavator. But although this increases the probability that these items were originally associ- ated with the earlier material in the deposit, which ranges from EM I-MM Ia, we cannot be sure that this was the case. The discs with perforations are very similar indeed to gold ones found at Platanos and probably of EM III-MM Ia date,43 while the silver ring with bezel may be compared to a gold example found in Troy II.44 Finally the silver foil bead in the Krasi group is comparable to the three beads of silver from Diimmler's grave group "D" from Kapros in Amorgos.45 Renfrew does not seem to have any strong views as to the date of this group,4" but I would imagine it can most rea- sonably be ascribed to the second phase of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age. There are no clearly dateable pieces in the group but the stone figurines can hardly be much later, and the ivory plaque with concentric rings on it finds a good parallel in Troy II and in the EH II period at Lerna.47 Furthermore the greenstone spoon and beads are in keeping with the Early Bronze II tradition in the Aegean,48 and the silver bowl may be com- pared with that from(?) Euboia"4 which is deco- rated with hatched triangles of characteristic EC II and EM II type."5 Finally the sealstone, which has been something of a stumbling block in attempting to date Diimmler's group, may I suggest be recog- nized as an Aegean product of the Early Bronze II phase. Its material, greenstone, is perfectly in ac- cord with this hypothesis and so too is the super- imposed cross design cut on its base.5" The design cut around the cylinder certainly echoes Mesopo- tamian sealings of the third millennium52 but it is so simple as to be of uncertain value as a means of identifying the seal's original source. The concen- tric circles, as we have mentioned above, are found on bone plaques of the Early Bronze II period, one of which appears in this same group. Renfrew em- phasizes that the motif also commonly appears on pottery of the Keros-Syros culture.53 There is thus really very little reason to seek an eastern origin for this seal, particularly since a seal of similar form (but not decoration) has been found recently at Poliochni.4 Thus I feel that Diimmler's grave group "D," and the Krasi bead, are probably of Early Bronze II date. The other pieces in the Krasi group also support a date for the group as a whole within the period EM II-III. If an EM II-III date is accepted for the Krasi group, then the silver ring with bezel found in splendid isolation in tomb XIV at Mochlos might also be dated to this period, though such a date must be tentative. Neither of the Minoan silver pins are distinctive enough to be dated by parallels and can only be dated within the broad limits of the find associations. In the case of Porti this is EM I-MM II, and in the case of Pla- tanos EM II-MM II. Of the artifacts there remains the lead figurine and fragmentary plaque. The only basis for giving these two pieces a date is the simi- lar figurine found in Troy II by Schliemann (his "burnt city") and therefore suggesting an EM I or II date for the two items from Crete--if one ac- cepts their authenticity.55 The dating of the silver and lead artifacts can be summarized as follows. Only one object, the silver dagger from Ghalania Kharakia, is certainly of EM III or MM Ia date. All of the other objects 42 Scrapers are rare in contexts later than MM Ia, with the exception of type VI (pendant type), see Branigan 36-38. 3 Xanthoudides pl. LVWI. 44 Schliemann op.cit.

In particular the Krasi group is probably to be placed within EM II as are the lead pieces found near Heraklion and the silver "figurine" plaque from Amnisos. There is no way in which the silver scraper from Trapeza and the pins from Platanos and Porti can be dated more precisely than Early Bronze Age, but typologically they too would fit comfortably into the EM II-III bracket.56 Addi- tional evidence of the early use of lead and silver can be obtained from the daggers with silver rivets and with significant silver and lead con- tents. Of these daggers, thirteen are certainly or very probably of EM II date and the remaining two are dateable to EM III-MM Ia.57 Thus it seems that silver and lead were most commonly used in EM II and perhaps in EM III. SILVER AND LEAD IN AEGEAN METALLURGY The place which silver and lead working occu- pied in Minoan metallurgy was small compared to that of both copper and gold working. Copper artifacts of Early Bronze Age date have been found on more than thirty sites in Crete and now total about five hundred pieces.58 Items of gold jewelry occur on some fifteen Early Minoan sites, including large groups from Platanos and Mochlos59 and smaller but significant groups from Agia Triadha, Porti, and Koumasa. The total number of gold items cannot be far short of that of copper artifacts. In contrast only nine sites have produced silver or lead artifacts and their combined total is only twenty-nine items. It is clear therefore that silver and lead were either more difficult to obtain or else were less popular than copper and gold. A regional qualification might be added to this conclusion, for while copper and gold are most commonly found in the Mesara and the south of Creteeo the silver and lead artifacts are predominantly distributed in the north of the island. There is one further qualifi- cation which should be borne in mind. Silver seems to have been used for the manufacture of items of jewelry which were rarely made of either copper or gold. There is for example a very marked scarci- ty of copper rings and bangles,61 yet seven of the twenty-three silver items in the catalogue fall within this category. A similar situation exists in the case of both pendants and pins,62 while the two vessels and the figurine in the catalogue represent the only metal examples of these objects yet known in the Cretan Early Bronze Age. Thus, while the scarcity of silver and lead in Early Minoan Crete cannot be questioned, its popularity should not really be doubted for it was used for the manufac- ture of some of the most prized pieces of jewelry and personal possessions. Furthermore the bulk of the silver and lead artifacts fall within the EM II and EM III period and these metals were therefore probably worked in Crete almost as early as copper, a situation repeated in the Cyclades.63 Indeed a small bead found at Palaikastro, apparently in EM I associations, is recorded as "? silver," and this may represent the earliest silver or lead artifact known in Crete at the present time.64 In this case it would be as early as the scraps of copper from Mochlos but later than the small axe from Knossos.65 In general the place of silver and lead in Early Minoan metallurgy would appear to be similar to their place in Cycladic and Troadic metalwork- ing. The range of objects is very similar indeed, mainly items of jewelry which include a notable number of rings and bangles,66 and vessels of vari- ous shapes including small bowls like those from Mochlos and Trapeza.67 The Heraklion figurine is paralleled by examples from Troy, Antiparos and Eos,68 while the Ghalania Kharakia dagger may be compared to a silver hooked-tang spear- head from Troy.69 Even the two small lead double- axe pendants find a parallel in the silver double- 56 Branigan 41. 7 Ten of the daggers are of the "triangular" type, for the dating of which see Branigan 27.

Yet there are distinct differences between the role of silver and lead in Crete and the Cyclades and Troad. In the Troad, for exam- ple, silver is very commonly used for the manu- facture of vessels-at least ten are extant-whereas in Crete we have but the single cup from Mochlos, and that a very poor specimen alongside the jugs or depas cup from the Troad.1 In the Cyclades silver is used for diadems and lead for model boats, in contrast to the dozens of gold diadems in Crete (which had not produced a single example in sil- ver) and the several clay models of boats from the island.7" We have mentioned earlier the common use of lead to repair broken pottery vessels in the Cyclades, the Troad and on the Greek mainland, yet not a single example of this usage is yet known in Crete. The difference between Cretan use of sil- ver and lead, and that in the Cyclades and Troad was determined it seems by a single factor-namely the availability of these metals. In the Cyclades and Troad they are relatively common, in Crete they are relatively scarce. Their relationship to the other two metals used in the Early Bronze Age, gold and copper, has already been demonstrated in the case of Crete. In the Cyclades finds of silver and lead are almost as widely distributed as those of copper, and in purely numerical terms silver and lead arti- facts account for something like 40 per cent of all metal finds of the Early Bronze Age.73 This con- trasts markedly with the situation in Crete where the figure is about 3 per cent. The importance of silver and lead in the Cyclades was apparently en- hanced by the almost complete absence of gold.74 While it was relatively abundant in Crete and the Troad, and even found in some of the Early Hel- ladic sites on the Greek mainland, it was to all in- tents and purposes unknown in the Cyclades. In the Troad, where gold was as prominent a metal as it was in Crete, silver occupied a less conspicu- ous place in the pattern of metallurgy. Even here though it was notably more common than it was in Crete. All three regions, however, would seem to have blossomed out into silver and lead working at the same time, and in the same phase of cultural de- velopment, the second phase of the Early Bronze Age. The ? silver bead from Palaikastro and the cast lead found by Renfrew on the Grotta-Pelos site at Cheiromylos75 suggest that experimental work- ing with lead may have begun in the first phase of the Early Bronze Age. This is confirmed by two, small loops of lead and a mended pottery vessel found by Blegen in Troy I."7 If the bead from Palaikastro was in fact made of lead rather than silver, as could well have been the case," it might be argued that it was not until the second phase of the Early Bronze Age that Aegean metallurgists found that they could obtain silver from the lead ores by means of cupellation. The silver and lead finds from the Troad and Cyclades are placed al- most exclusively within the Early Bronze II phase, which is perhaps some confirmation for the EMII date tentatively assigned on archaeological and typological grounds to much of the Minoan as- semblage. The richness of the silver and lead finds from the Cyclades and the Troad may perhaps explain the anomalous distribution of artifacts of these metals in Crete. It will be recalled that while the north of the island was relatively unproductive of gold and copper work, and was indeed quite re- tarded in the art of copper-working,"8 the bulk of the silver and lead pieces were found in the region between Heraklion and Mochlos. This is the re- gion which directly faces the Cyclades, and it may be more than coincidence that two of the sites pro- ducing silver and lead finds are the ports of Moch- los and Amnisos, both founded in EM I. Further- more it is in this region that one finds the clearest evidence of contact with the Cycladic culture. Some of the burials at Pyrgos for example were accom- 70M. J.

The discovery of obsidian cores is not so common however, and the cores found on Pseira, not far from Mochlos where six of the catalogue entries were found, may thus have some significance in terms of the importation of "raw" obsidian.86 To the list of Cycladic elements in northern Crete we may add a marble lid from Knossos.87 Finally it is of considerable interest that the biggest group of silver and lead objects yet dis- covered in Early Minoan associations should have been found in the so-called tholos at Krasi. Typo- logically the tomb falls halfway between the Cycla- dic built-graves and the Minoan tholoi, being larger than the Cycladic graves but considerably smaller than the tholoi and built in the built-grave tech- nique. That this tomb should be regarded as an enlarged built-grave of Cycladic type rather than a primitive tholos is suggested by two considera- tions. Apart from this tomb at Krasi, the Early Minoan tholoi are found exclusively in the south of Crete in the vicinity of the Mesara.88 The dis- tribution of the tholoi therefore argue strongly against the tomb at Krasi being regarded as their prototype. Secondly Krasi is situated, as we have just seen, in what we might call the Cycladic "prov- ince" of Early Minoan Crete. The tomb at Krasi and the silver and lead objects found within it are the clearest manifestation of this "province" which we yet have. THE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS One reason why the peoples of the Cyclades used silver and lead in relative abundance is presumably because lead ores are widely distributed in the area. Renfrew refers to deposits in eight islands and says that there are others.89 Strangely the list does not include those islands where notable finds of silver and lead artifacts have been made-Naxos, Syros and Amorgos. Nevertheless there can be little doubt that the Cycladic metallurgists utilized these local sources during the Early Bronze Age, and this is perhaps confirmed by the clear signs of lead working found at Ayia Irini in Kea and Chieromy- los in Dhespotikon,"9 in each case within easy reach of galena deposits. This being so it is not unlikely that the inhabitants of northern Crete, where we have seen Cycladic contacts to be widespread, ob- tained silver and lead from the islands. Dependence on Cycladic supplies of silver and lead might well explain both the geographical and chronological limits within which the silver and lead artifacts are found in Crete. As I have demonstrated elsewhere, from EM III onward the Minoans were drawn in- creasingly into trade with the eastern Mediterrane- an, and Cycladic and other Aegean contacts became of relatively less importance."9 Nevertheless there remains the possibility that the Minoans utilized their own sources of silver and lead. Faure has recently published details of some ten localities in Crete where lead ore can be found. Two of these, Vroukhas and Ayios An- tonios, are in the northern region where the silver 79Xanthoudides op.cit. (supra n. 40) I36ff. 80 Renfrew pl. I2.

In particular they are within easy reach of Mochlos, Trapeza, Krasi and Amnisos where the bulk of the objects were found. The possibility therefore remains that the distribution of silver and lead artifacts in the north is related to the occurrence of lead ores in Crete and a general affinity with Cycladic tradi- tions in jewelry, rather than the supply of metal which might have been available in the Cyclades. Finally some consideration must be given to the contacts between Crete and the western Mediter- ranean, which would seem to become appreciable in EM III. While I agree with Renfrew that the case for Aegean influence in the western Mediter- ranean has been much overstated,92 there is never- theless sufficient evidence of contact between the two regions to allow the possibility that from EM III onward the Minoans obtained some of their metal from Italy, Sardinia or Spain.9 In my opin- ion this possibility is given considerable support by the discovery of the three silver daggers at Kouma- sa, for which I have argued an Italian origin." It may also be significant that the only Minoan silver or lead artifact of known EMIII-MMIa date is the dagger from Ghalania Kharakia, also in the south of the island. EARLY BRONZE 2 IN THE AEGEAN The small group of silver and lead objects from Early Minoan Crete are yet another manifestation of the "international spirit" of the Aegean Early Bronze 2 phase of which Renfrew has written.95 The range of objects covered is remarkably in accord with the repertoire of the Cycladic and Tro- adic silversmiths and the metal of which these ob- jects are made may very well have been imported from the Cyclades. The importance of metallurgy to the development of the prosperous Early Bronze 2 cultures of the Aegean is rightly emphasized by Renfrew, and indeed its importance goes far be- yond EB 2 and has a profound effect on the de- velopment of Minoan civilization in the second millennium B.C.96 Cycladic influence on Minoan metallurgy extends beyond the field of the silversmith, however, to the wider field of copper-working. The Cycladic weapons of the Keros-Syros culture are generally of more advanced type than the weapons of EM II, and it seems likely that it was from the Cyclades that the Minoans learnt the arts of metallurgy. If the Troad was the earliest centre of metallurgy in the Aegean, as we might reasonably suppose on current evidence," then the natural route by which the knowledge would reach Crete would be through the Cyclades. This being so the developed forms of the typical Aegean long dagger types which appear in the Keros-Syros culture of the Cyclades (my types LD.III, IV, VI and VIII; Ren- frew's types IVa, IVb, and VII) are types which were probably invented in the Cyclades. The same may be said of the axe-adze, spearheads of types Sp. I and II (Renfrew types IIb and IId), and the single-blade axe." The position occupied by the Greek mainland in the development of Aegean metallurgy is not yet clear. Metal finds of Early Helladic date are few in number and generally undistinguished. The axe-adze and other tools of EH II date from Eutresis and the spearhead of EH II date from Lerna suggest however that the paucity of metal finds may be misleading, and that Early Helladic metallurgy was technically as ad- vanced as that of the Cyclades and Crete.99 The Early Helladic weapons that have been found sug- gest that the impetus originally came from the Cyclades rather than the Troad, for the daggers fall within Renfrew's types IV and IIIc and are not characteristic of Troadic weapons.100 In particular there seems to be a strong Cycladic element in the 92 Renfrew 17, 13. There were in fact artifacts being pro- duced in Iberia which contained large amounts of tin and this was presumably of local derivation (see J. Serra i Vilaro, ElVas Campaniforme a Catalunya i les Coves Sepulcrals Eneo- litiques [19231 55, fig. 76). On the other hand tin is known in Anatolia (cf. Renfrew 13). Ryan (A Guide to the Known Minerals of Turkey [1957] 62) records eight occurrences, and Wainwright ("Early Tin in the Aegean," Antiquity 18 [1944] 59), referring to Przeworski's report, mentions seven. One of those mentioned by Ryan was worked during this century. Renfrew's case in favour of a Troadic or Anatolian origin is thus stronger than it appears. 93 Branigan op.cit. (supra n. 28). The fact that the evidence of contact is mainly to be found in the metalwork is, I think, significant. 94Ibid. 103-105. 95 Renfrew I5ff. 96 Branigan 57. 97Renfrew 14 comes to the same conclusion, with reserva- tions. Those who would lower the date of Troy I into the second half of the third millennium B.c. would not of course subscribe to this view. 98 Branigan 28-31. 99H.

The establishment of Minoan interests in Kythera in EM II however must have led to wider contacts with the mainland of Greece during the Early Bronze 2 phase than has generally been recognized. Foot amulets from Agios Kosmas and Zygouries and a bottle seal from Agios Kos- mas point very clearly indeed to direct contacts with Crete.02 The gold pendant from Zygouries finds good parallels in Crete at Platanos and Moch- los, but a silver pin from the same site is of the double-spiral variety pointing very clearly to Cycla- dic contacts too.'03 Cycladic contacts with the mainland of Greece are certainly more clearly evidenced than Minoan ones, and despite the Mi- noan interests in Kythera the most surprising fea- ture of the Early Bronze 2 phase in the Aegean is not the extensive contacts of the period but the extent to which Crete stands apart from them. The sauceboat, frying-pan, and depas cup so widely distributed across the Aegean are completely un- known in Crete.'04 Bastioned fortifications com- parable to those of the Troad, Cyclades and Greek mainland are absent in Crete. In contrast we find that the great communal tombs of Early Minoan Crete are missing from the rest of the Aegean, and to a lesser extent the same is true of sealstones, foot amulets, bull figurines, and a variety of ce- ramic types. It is only in metallurgy that the Mi- noans were really brought into close affinity with the Troad, Cyclades and mainland, and even here they showed a notable independence.'05 Few in number as they may be, the Early Minoan arti- facts of silver and lead represent one of the closest areas of contact between Crete and the rest of the Aegean during the second phase of the Early Bronze Age, and as such they deserve more at- tention than has previously been paid to them.
