At this occasion, he had the rare chance to travel through the north-eastern part of this country, called Djouf after the homonymous wadi which traverses the rugged highlands over 150 kms (cf. the sketch map). He knew that this part of the Yemen is inhabited by very xenophobic bedouin tribes like the Dahm and the Dhu Hussein who are constantly in war with one another. Being above all interested in the Arabic nomadism, he was attracted by the marginal areas of the big desert Rub Al-Khali where he hoped to find people still living their traditional nomadic way of life. Provided with a letter of recommendation addressed to a bedouin sheikh of the mighty Dahm tribe, Kortler left in January 1976 the capital Sana'a for the Rub al-Khali. During the following ten weeks, he crossed on foot or on camelback with bedouins large tracts of land which can be with high probability considered as not yet visited by any European in modern times. Almost every day, Kortler's guides drew his attention to "helalic" rock pictures and inscriptions — they are called so after a legendary pre-Islamic ruler Abu Seet El Helali by the local bedouins who name themselves his sons. Kortler realized that these petroglyphs were, for their most part, hitherto unknown prehistoric and protohistoric monuments. He therefore endeavoured to copy and to photograph most of the graffiti, sometimes even against the resistance of the bedouins. In the Rimai (Sands) which is the name given by the local bedouins to the Rub al-Khali, Kortler traversed many times the route of Abdallah Philby who travelled through this region in the late twenties on his way from Er Riadh to Hadramaut. Old bedouins narrated Kortler that Philby recorded a few "kataba" (rock inscriptions). Kortler observed that the pre-Islamic inscriptions predominated on the margins of the high lands, abruptly sloping down towards the north-east, presumably in the proximity of ancient camel tracks, whereas the rock pictures showing hunting and war scenes, bovines, horses and otriches were more numerous on the many volcanic hills of the open sandy desert. He estimat ed that there still must be thousands of undiscovered rock pictures and inscriptions in the northern Yemen. Catalogue.

On the whole slab, there are almost white recent scars, most probably where the engraved rock was hit with in tentionally pelted stones (iconoclasm?) . The rock art material collected by Kortler can be iconologically divided into the following main groups: armed camel-riders and horsemen (figs. 4, 6, 8, 9, 12-13, 16, 19, 20, 23-25, 28, 30, 31); anthropomorphs posing with arms and orants (figs. 4, 12, 17, 22, 24, 26, 32, 34, 35, 40, 41); symbols (figs. 10-12, 20, 25-27, 33, 35, 38); ibexes (figs. 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 26, 29) and bovines (figs. 5, 18, 36, 37, 39). There are also rock drawings of camels and dogs alone (figs. 10, 14,15).</page><page sequence="7">Rock Art Discoveries in the Northern Yemen 231 Chronologically, the group of the bovine representations is probably the most ancient. It shows only humpless cattle, which has been absent in the Arabian Peninsula since prehistoric times but is depicted in its rock art (Howe 1950: fig. 1, pi. IA; Anati 1968a: figs. 3, 69, 74, 76; Cervicek 1971a: pi. 1). Our examples from the northern Yemen do not belong to the schematic Ethiopian-Arabian or Dahthami style (Cervicek 1971b: 130f.;Anati 1972: 72—73) which is typical of bovine representations in Arabian and Ethiopian rock art. Their naturalistic style is reminiscent of similar bovine representations in Upper Egyptian, Nubian and Libyan rock art which bear resemblance to pottery decorations of the Nubian C-Group peoples who inhabited Lower Nubia from the end of the 3rd to mid-2nd millennia BC (Cervicek 1974: 182 -183). The cow-and-calf motif of fig. 36 recurs in Ethiopian, Eritrean, Nubian and Libyan rock art (Cervicek 1975: 50—51) as well as on the C-Group pottery (Steindorff 1935: p. 57/1, 14). The ibex, which is in our material mostly shown attacked by hunting dogs, is a widespread motif of Western and Central Asian rock art. In most cases it shows over-naturalistic horns like one variant of this motif in South Arabian decorative art dating from about the seventh century BC onwards (Doe 1971: 22, 104, pi. 7). Our fig. 29 represents an ibex with hypertrophied horns facing a dog and a horseman — datable funerary reliefs from Yemen showing horsemen go back to the first century BC (Bulliet 1975: 96, fig. 43). The smaller ibex in fig. 2 seems on the grounds of the same patina contemporary with the camel-rider on the left for which the second millenium BC can be considered as a tentative terminus a quo when the camels may have been introduced to Arabia (Doe 1971: 50). The group of anthropomorphs with feathered head-dresses posing with arms in fig. 40 (photo 8) can be dated according to the dagger with the very broad lunate pommel carried by the warrior figure bottom right; this weapon is typical of Alaça Hiiyük in Anatolia and Ur in Southern Mesopotamia in the mid-3rd millennium BC as well as of the Jebel Qara rock art in Central Arabia (Anati 1968a: 74—75, fig. 19). Similar in style are figs. 17 (photo 1), 34 (photo 7) and 35. As to the orants (figs. 4, 12, 24, 32), an analogous figure was found carved in a plinthstone for a statue dating from about 2000 BC in Bahrain (Glob 1955: 191, fig. 7) but the juxtapositions figs. 12 and 24 indicate that some of them were contemporary with the armed horsemen and camel-riders. In Central Arabia, similar orants have been dated to the late 2nd and the 1st millennia BC (Anati 1972: 156). This motif also occurs in Upper Egyptian and Nubian rock art (Cervicek 1975: 144—145) but it is characteristic of the Bronze Age rock art of Scandinavia and Siberia. The Siberian orants, which are paralleled in pottery decora tions, have been interpreted as shamans in praying posture (Okladnikov 1966: 136, fig. 43). Horsemen and camel-riders are the most common motif in our material and their characteristic featuré is the long lance, the length of which would range, proportionally to the associated animal and human figures, between 2 and 4 metres. The Greek historian Herodian reports that the Arabs in the army of the Persian Artabanus when he fought the Roman emperor Macrinus in 218 AD "forced their way by jabbing from above with their long spears" (Herodian, 4.14. 3-15.3). The use of the long lance is further attested by funerary reliefs from the Yemen dated to the third or fourth centuries AD which often show the defunct as camel-rider armed with this weapon (Grohmann 1963: 227, pl. XVIII, 1 ; Bulliet 1975: 96, fig. 43) and by Arabic poetry in which the lance is considered to be ideally a horseman's weapon despite the fact that it became a characteristic weapon of camel-riders (Schwarzlose 1886:46—47). Apart from Arabia (cf. Field 1970: pis. 1—3; Anati 1974: figs. 175, 176, 178, 179, 195, 196, 270, 271, 289, 290), this motif is frequent in Nubian rock art — corresponding lances with leaf shaped iron points, 30 cms and more long, and wooden shafts of over 2 metres in length have</page><page sequence="8">232 Pavel Íervííek and Fritz Kortler been excavated in Meroitic and Ballana cemetries (Cervicek 1973: 3, 6, chart NM7, XI). In fig. 19, the camel in the centre carries the North Arabian saddle sadád, composed of two large saddle bows shaped like inverted V's, which enabled the camel-rider for the first time to use the lance and armour and thus fully develop his military capacities (Dostal 1959: 20, 24, Fig. 5). It came into use among the Bedouins in the 3rd century AD and inaugurated the fully developed Bedouin Period of horse- and camel-riding warriors (Dostal 1958: 10, fig. 21). On the evidence of the juxtapositions in figs. 20 (photo 2) and 25 (photo 5), the symbols are at least partly contemporary with the horsemen and camel-riders. The pre-Islamic symbol assemblages like in figs. 11, 27 (photo 6) and 38 are widespread throughout Central and Southern Arabia (Anati 1968b: passim;Doe 1971: figs. 63, 64, 69, 123, 124, 128). The super impositions in figs. 12 and 20 (photo 2) show that the snake is more recent than the other symbols and the remaining graffiti. What can we learn from the discussed rock art about the history of Yemen? In the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC, there existed a cult of the humpless cattle and a cult of the ibex in the northern Yemen, the former of African, the latter of Asiatic origin. Both cults were reflected by representations of humpless bovines, sometimes with anthropomorphs adoring them, and by those of ibexes with over-naturalistic horns. They are echoed in the Sabaean religion where both the bull and the ibex were sacred animals of the supreme god 'Almaqah (Grohmann 1963: 244). In the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, representations of horse- and camel-riding warriors, paralleled in Nubian rock art, mark the change from proto- to fully developed bedouinism.
