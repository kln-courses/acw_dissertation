<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ 335 ] ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. T3 UDOLF EUCKEN, the author of the Activist philosophy, has been spoken of as a Hegelian; our object, in brief, is to inquire whether he is rightly so called. It is obvious at the outset that the question raised cannot have a yes-or-no answer, for the simple reason that there is no standard interpretation of Hegel's teaching. Hegelians of the Right might welcome Activism, and those of the Left reject it. Still the inquiry need not be fruitless ; for even if the question of the name be left open, the two philosophies will be found to show striking points of resemblance and instructive contrasts. Then the ques tion before us resolves itself into a comparison of the new with the older German idealism. One might pursue this inquiry through all the ramifications of Activism, through its particular problems and applications ; for Eucken is steeped throughout in Hegelian thought. But it may be sufficient to confine the comparison to four cardinal points—method, principle, and general conception of philosophy, and of history. In respect of method the philosophers, both being idealists, have naturally much in common. In both cases denial of the immediate is the formal starting-point, and, like Hegel, Eucken maintains that an inherent contradic tion forces thought to leave the immediate, and, indeed, that contradiction is the dynamic of the whole process of the spirit. Further, the triadic movement of thesis, anti thesis, and synthesis, so distinctively Hegelian, appears not infrequently in Eucken's argument. But a closer examination reveals a wide divergence in procedure.</page><page sequence="2">336 ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. Contradiction, as will be shown later, means one thing for Hegel, and another thing for Eucken. The latter finds the triple rhythm in many spheres of thought, but not in all ; and, again, when he leaves the immediate fact, he leaves it absolutely, and does not return to it. Hegel's method is unilinear; he takes one starting point and presses forward from it uniformly without a backward glance, and so by sheer consistency and the apparent completeness of his dialectic he produces a unique effect. Eucken employs a multiplicity of tentative starting-points, and develops his argument along many lines. He is always, so to speak, beginning afresh, and if his reasoning appears redundant and halting, that is perhaps the effect which he prefers to produce. He likes to be true to life, and the hurly-burly of life in its varied aspects is his real starting-point, the fact or set of facts whose inner contradiction impels it beyond itself. By ' life' he does not understand the facts of biology or the existence of the individual, but the working of spirit as it manifests itself in the whole of humanity, especially in civilization and culture. To this life he puts the question r "What is it that makes life possible?" His meaning is that more is implied in life than is expressed, and that it is the business of philosophy to bring this implication to full consciousness. He often puts the same question in another form, namely, "What is it that makes modern life or the present situation go impossible ? " and his answer is, " neglect of the primary presupposition or sine qua non of life." Again, besides asking this question of life in general, he asks it of the various departments of human life; that is to say, he discusses a series of philosophical problems, most of them agelong, some of them of modern origin, and his solution is in every case the same. This solution is his philosophic principle. As with Hegel, his method springs directly from the principle of his system.</page><page sequence="3">ACTIVISM AND HE GEL I A NISM. 337 However, ' system ' is hardly the word for Eucken's philosophy. Its lack of system is the first thing that strikes a reader fresh from Hegel and his deductions. Eucken hopes, indeed, that the future may see an organiza tion of life on a sound philosophical basis, but he considers that a comprehensive system of thought is neither desirable nor possible, and that the attempt to construct one led Hegel into error. He dislikes the virtuosity of Panlogism : in his view the harmony and finish of a well-rounded scheme are out of place in philosophy, and, so far from recom mending its explanation of things, indicate serious omissions. It is not that he writes without plan, but that his results make no pretence to finality or complete ness. While Hegel offers for our contemplation an artistic conspect, a panorama of timeless truth and reality, Eucken sounds a call for action in the present, opening up no more than a vista of a brighter future in the dim distance. Both philosophers are led by their methods to a transcendental principle which opposes and at the same time explains empirical existence. At first sight one might be inclined to identify the two principles. Hegel's Begriff and Eucken's Geistesleben have much in common. Both are cosmic or universal processes; both are all inclusive and not directed to anything alien from them selves ; both transcend mechanical categories, so that, in Eucken's words, "the whole can appear at individual points." Eucken says, in a phrase reminiscent of Hegel, " We look upon spiritual life as the ' coming-to-itself' of the world process."1 Again, both principles are freely creative, not at random, but in virtue of an inner necessity and dynamic, and each professes itself the measure of all things, an absolute standard of value. But here we must cry a halt to identification. There are at least three material points of divergence On the questions of personality, of the 1 Eucken, " Main Currents of Modern Thought," tr. Booth, p. 390.</page><page sequence="4">338 ACTIVISM AND HliGELIANISM. human spirit, and of logical thought, the two philosophers differ widely. To take first the concept of personality. Eucken puts it at the heart of things, and that is perhaps his most signal departure from Hegelianism. Not a few disciples of Hegel have tried to read personality into his system; but it is more than doubtful if it is there. Neither the abstract Begriff nor its realization in Geist necessarily contains it. Certainly Hegel would admit a cosmic self consciousness; but he would equally certainly reject Eucken's " world-embracing personality." Personality includes more than self-consciousness; it has room at least for self-determination and for love. Eucken is very guarded here; he is afraid of personality becoming a catchword and an excuse for vague thinking or dogmatism. Yet he puts it in the forefront of his philosophy, though from his own principles he cannot define it. He insists that it must not be confused with the subject nor with any development of the subject; the subject is a symbol of the higher personality. For Eucken a person is neither a man nor a superman. If it is an ego, it is a transcendental ego, and if that, more than a synthetical faculty or moral disposition. An essential function of personality, according to Eucken, is to overcome the opposition between our two highest generalizations, subjective and objective. To regard that distinction as ultimate involves us in intolerable contradictions; Eucken maintains that such contradictions are paralysing the modern world, and he instances the oscillation between an empty subjectivism and " soulless work." Now, Hegel's " Absolute Idea" claims to be a synthesis of subject and object, and so at first sight it resembles Eucken's " personality." But the resemblance is only superficial. The "Absolute Idea" is nothing but a summation of the lower categories. For,</page><page sequence="5">ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. 339 according to Hegel's principles, thought must come back to and rest in itself. To give the crown of the categories any new content would spoil the coherence of the whole dialectic. However, if for the sake of illustration we could imagine the same series terminating in personality, we should gain some idea of the rich content of Eucken's principle, and of the possibilities it opens up to life. But, further, this personality is only potential, until our action actualizes it; it is not something given or a secure possession, but a task and a problem: it sets a direction rather than a goal before our energies. Poten tiality is often used as an asylum of ignorance, but Eucken makes it a stimulus to endeavour, and the foundation of a belief in real progress. Is progress possible on Hegelian principles? We see there lower categories passing into higher, and call it progress ; but is that not rather due to the subject's self-deception ? Looked at objectively the human spirit is stationary, with a stereotyped set of high, low, and middle values. The minute-hand moves uniformly round the dial of Time, but ever comes back to its starting-point, and there is no small hand to register advance. But Eucken's clock has two hands, which can go forward or be set back; thus for him real progress and real retrogression are possible. He cannot with Hegel easily identify the rational and the actual. Accordingly he does not attempt to define or deduce his principle, for, as Bergson puts it, " we know things that are made, not things in the making." In passing we may note that Eucken has not a little in common with another prominent philosopher of the present day. The very name of his philosophy, Activism, would suggest Bergson's reiterated statement, " The desti nation of consciousness is action." More particularly in its later phases Bergson's thought approaches Eucken's. His Duree tends to appear as spirit, since it gives out</page><page sequence="6">340 ACTIVISM AND HEGEL1AN1SM. more than it contains, that is to say, is creative. His elusive Elan vital becomes a supra-consciousness or potential personality. He writes : " Are we not led to suppose that in this passage of consciousness through matter, consciousness is tempered like steel, and tests itself by clearly constituting personalities and preparing them, by the very effort which each of them is called upon to make, for a higher form of existence But the two principles differ also in respect of their relation to man. This second contrast is a consequence of the first. Hegel, maintaining an impersonal spirit, was under no necessity to go further than the spirit of humanity. But Eucken cannot stop there ; laying all the stress, as he does, upon personality, he cannot permit any risk of confusion between personality and the empirical individual. Human personality according to him attains only a relative independence and partial unity, and contains no absolute truth. He expressly charges Hegel with identifying human spiritual life and absolute spiritual life. Nor is this a misrepresentation. It is true Hegel often condemns the merely human, yet he falls into a more refined anthropomorphism. He condemns man at his worst, but seems content with man at his best. His denial of the sensuous existence of the individual only prepares the way for his affirmation of man in society, for the human spirit as it objectifies itself in law, morality, political life, and history, and returns to itself in art, religion, and philosophy. But with Eucken it is otherwise. For him humanity can never be an end in itself: neither amelioration of social conditions, nor raising the standard of living, nor perfecting of the individual, is of intrinsic value. He regards the spirit of man not as the treasure-house of truth, but as the porch giving access to it. Further, Eucken traces the principle of things to 1 Quoted by Balsillie, " Bergson's Philosophy," p. 169.</page><page sequence="7">ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. 341 something wider than logical thought, and to this ' something'he gives the name of 'life.' Here we have the third point of contrast. Hegel ranks the thought of thought above the thought of life, and therefore he makes thought the universal process; but can ' thought' carry the content assigned to it? It seems a strain on the legitimate use of language. Of course it is open to a creative philosopher like Hegel to expand the meaning of an ordinary word, and indeed to form his own vocabulary; but the familiar usage is apt to reassert itself. When, for instance, one hears that the truth of things is thought, the psychic function of thinking occurs to the mind, and it is hard to conceive a mere mental process as having the requisite universality and richness. Panlogism all too easily becomes intellectualism. Eucken sees this danger ^ indeed it is to him more than a danger; he considers it an actual and inevitable outcome of the Hegelian philosophy. Accordingly, though, in respect of its all pervading energy, inner purpose, and relation to history, his principle resembles the Begriff, yet he refuses to give it that name, but prefers to call it ' life.' The latter term has the required elasticity, and suggests perhaps the element of mystery that Eucken is far from denying. It is much more than a question of terminology, as appears when practical applications are made. Eucken's opinion appears to be that a denial of the immediate is not merely an act of thought,1 but involves a change in man's whole attitude to life, and that intellectual acuteness is no index to the strength of spiritual life, whether in the individual or the age. Accordingly he attempts in opposition to Hegel to disparage the effect of logical contradiction. Antinomies, he says, do not disturb the main current of our life ; it is only argument based on life that carries real conviction; not necessity of thought 1 "Main Currents," p. 41.</page><page sequence="8">342 ACTIVISM AND HEGELIAN ISM. but necessity of life impels to action ; we can tolerate a contradiction in thought : a vital contradiction is another thing. He regards the instinct of spiritual self-preservation as the main dynamic, maintaining that that instinct ■"compels man to affirm truths to which his intellectual capacity is not fully equal."1 For instance, intellect can express the relation between spirit and nature only as gradation : life, says Eucken, compels us to regard it as one of contrast. He is constantly opposing his " either— or " to Hegel's " both." He makes no attempt to reconcile spiritual and natural life ; not that he is a dualist, but because he holds that thought cannot compass any such theodicy. Life, he says, points the direction in which the reconciliation is to be sought, namely, activity, but he thinks a merely theoretical solution impossible. Perhaps he was warned by Hegel's failure here. For it must be confessed that the transition from the Absolute Idea to Nature is one of the weak points of the dialectic ; it may well be doubted whether Hegel ever passes from the thought of the thing to the thing itself. These are the chief differences between the two philosophies in respect of method and of principle. Whether in view of them Eucken is to be styled a Hegelian will be a matter of opinion; some will regard the later as a development of the earlier idealism ; others will see in Activism a complete breach with Hegelianism. But in either case the divergence is significant. The difference in philosophic principle suggests that a radical change has taken place since Hegel's time in men's conception of philosophy, of its basis, scope, and aims. Eucken has made it clear that world-life is far more important than a Welt-anschauung. Of course the quest of truth controls both conceptions of philosophy. But the truth for Hegel is the knowledge that absolute spirit 1 " Main Currents," p. 155.</page><page sequence="9">ACTIVISM AND IIEGELIANTSM. 343 has of itself something static, while Eucken aims at a truth that is a process, a becoming truth. Hence for Eucken truth is primarily a task and a problem, not a fact. In spite of Hegel's attempt to make philosophy the heart of culture, it tended in his hands to become a mere view of reason and reality, an arm-chair occupation, with little or no effect on the course of things. But for Eucken philosophy is the direct and effectual co-operation of persons in the cosmic problem. He insists that the philosopher, freed from the trammels of subjectivity, creates independent reality. He guards against an over weening conceit of human powers by laying down, as against Hegel, that this creation can be only very gradual, and that we cannot at a given moment construct a com prehensive form of reality,1 or lay down with finality the lines of spiritual development. These cautions are necessitated not only by the limitations of the acutest human intellect, but by the opposition of what Schelling called the " ideal irrational." Spiritual creations, Eucken maintains, are not ipso facio stereotyped; they have con tinually to be wrested anew from nature ; the intervention of the person is constantly needed to preserve and recreate them ; and that is philosophy. Eucken is concerned to prove that philosophy has its provenance in a wider sphere than the intellect, and we can illustrate his contention from the history of Hegelianism itself. It was a child of its age. Both the rise and decline of its influence were determined by the general conditions of life. The main stream of life brought it into prominence; but when it tried to take up an independent position in the intellect, the stream swept by, and left it high and dry. In all departments of life in the eighteenth century man had been asserting himself as against the immensity of the outside world, refusing to be 1 Eucken, "Life of the Spirit," tr. Pogson, p. 331.</page><page sequence="10">344 ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. written off as petty, or as a cog in the machine. Then came the German classical period, with its intellectual giants. There seemed to be no limits to human powers. Schiller could apostrophize man as "Herr der Natur, die deine Fesseln liebet."1 Then naturally it was asked whether man need look beyond himself and his intellect for creation of all reality. The pages of Hegel reflect this spirit: we see there a superb consciousness of creative power and haughty assurance of possessing the whole truth. But a reaction was inevitable. The general mass of mankind could not attain such an intellectual salvation: for them work in the outside world was the dominant feature of life. Then came the advance of science ; man's supreme position in the universe was questioned; to understand and subdue to human convenience the forces of nature appeared the great problem. Amidst all these movements attention was taken away from Hegel. His philosophy was not refuted, but neglected. It proved inadequate to the later situation, and fell out of touch with the times. It is probably in the field of history that Hegel's labours have proved most fruitful. He made little or no contribu tion to our store of historical material; indeed he was not seldom mistaken or misinformed as to facts. But he gave a sound basis to the science ; of the history of philosophy we can say that he made it a science,2 gave it its dignity, and made it worth while for us to study past thought systems. So it may be of use to point out what parts of his theory of history Eucken accepts, and what parts of it he qualifies. Hegel's philosophy of history may be roughly sum marized as follows :—The content of history is twofold : the universal and necessary appear side by side with 1 Schiller, " Die Kiinstler." 5 Windelband, " History of Philosophy," tr. Tufts, p. 10.</page><page sequence="11">ACTIVISM AND HEGELIANISM. 345 contingent events: to the former element the name of history properly belongs. This element is the inner purpose of the ages, itself timeless and presenting a fixed point of resistance to the stream of time. A chronicle of events is not a history: historical ideas must be reached and set forth in their necessary sequence. In unravelling this inner purpose the historian pursues the same object as does the philosopher, and their results should coincide. In almost all of this theory Eucken concurs. To both philosophers history is the text-book of philosophy. Hegel found in history the clue to his dialectic, and Eucken prefaces every discussion with a historical sketch. However, the difference in principle affects the whole course of their philosophies. Their conceptions of history diverge just as do their conceptions of philosophy. Eucken admits that reason struggles to manifest itself in history, but he denies that history is reason. He rejects Hegel's attempt to " base history upon a formula,"1 or to construct it according to a scheme of concepts. Even with allowance made for the contingent, a full knowledge of the universal would make life unreal, and would in effect give man almost unlimited powers of prophecy. Eucken's position is that if there is a key to the future, it is not in man's possession. He is alive to the fact that history repeats itself, and to the philosophical significance of that fact. He admits the power of " historical ideas," and even their recurrence in something of a sequence, but the elevation of that recurrence to a definite, calculable periodicity he regards as an extravagance of intel lectualism, due ultimately to an exaggerated view of human capacity. The very nature of history bears out this conclusion. The common idea, in which Hegel in a measure acquiesced, is that history is a definite datum : that is to say, that a 1 " Main Currents," p. 358.</page><page sequence="12">346 ACTIVISM AND HE G ELI A NISM. capable historian can ascertain for us the final truth in all essentials about a given period. Eucken points out the falsity of this idea. He maintains that the absolute history has not been and cannot be written. Not only do the constant discovery of new material and the improvements in research methods render such an achievement impro bable, but the flow of thought and life makes it impossible for two historians to approach the same period and the same historical material from the same standpoint. Accordingly, every generation has its own history of the past: there is room for a " history of history," as Eucken phrases it. Hegel made it clear that the past determines the present; Eucken shows it is equally true that the present determines the past. A constant endeavour of science is to eliminate the "personal equation" in the interests of exact calculation. A so-called scientific method of history attempts to minimize, if not totally to banish from history, what is ordinarily put down to personality. For this Hegel is largely responsible. He viewed human history as a steady progress, the general trend of which could be ascer tained, and at any rate the universal element predicted. Accordingly he attempts to dispense with personality. Impersonal spirit supplies the motive-power and the course and the goal. Movements, not men, count with Hegel — witness his attempt to construct an impersonal universal history. Eucken takes exception to this view, and bends all his efforts to refute it. To it in a large measure he traces the spiritual paralysis of the modern world. The cry for co-operation, the appeal to numerical majorities, the dearth of creative genius in most departments of culture and art, are to him symptomatic of the decline of independent personality. He complains, " We have gained the world, but we have lost the soul. "» Accordingly in his 1 Eucken, "Truth of Religion," translated by Tudor Jones, p. 66.</page><page sequence="13">ACTIVISM AND HEGEL IA NISM. 347 conception of history he emphasizes two points which Hegelianism has thrown into the background—first, the struggle for reason in history; second, the paramount importance of personality in that struggle. He contends that spiritual life or reason or truth, by whatever name we call it, does not simply unfold itself in history; that it will not develop and actualize itself without the constant intervention of the person ; that history does not make men but men history.1 The heart of Eucken's teaching and the significance of the name Activism may perhaps be expressed in a sentence. The spiritual achievements of one age are not perpetuated unless they are appropriated, assimilated, and developed in succeeding ages by the free and conscious decision of individuals, who thereby are raised above their human particularity.
