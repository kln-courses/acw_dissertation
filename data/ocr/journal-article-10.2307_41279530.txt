One gets the uncomfortable feeling while reading this study that Professor Klinkowitz does not respect or even like contemporary literature that much. By saying this I do not mean that Structuring the Void is too critical of recent American fiction, or that it is informed by post-structuralist theory to the exclusion of the literary texts themselves. I do mean, however, that Klinkowitz so enthusiastically limits American fiction's social, his- torical, and aesthetic currency that he forgets literature's unique and various cultural functions. As Lionel Trilling once said about his contemporaries, Klinkowitz neglects the critic's most important duty: to understand "what [literature] does not do so that we may know what it does do." Klinkowitz begins his study by setting the boundaries for what Susan Sontag calls "art projects": "Writers surely create something, but their fiction is no longer seen best in terms of subject or even content, but rather as a structuring act that becomes its own reality. Thus even though all material claims yield only a void, it is a structured void, with the fiction writer's acts creating a systematic web of relationships that is sustained not by what it captures or spans but rather by its own network of constructions" (2). This thesis by itself is broad enough to be unobjectionable, for certainly no critic would wish to say that writers do not structure their own unique fictional world. However, in retrospect, this opening premise predicts various problems throughout Klinkowitz's study. For one, he constantly uses the phrase "structuring the void" as a shorthand for any historical or social context that he is unable or unwilling to account for. So, what in the above the passage seems like a simple statement of artistic independence actually is something else entirely: a claim that contemporary fiction, in "structuring the void" of subject matter, is not significantly nourished by anything outside of the text's "own reality." As a result, Klinkowitz writes, "neither painter nor author need be troubled with representing content or subject, for the system takes care of that as a fully evident activity. With that estab- lished both author and reader are free to deal with the purely artistic problems of execu- tion and reception. And these are on the level of sign, the spatial context in which structuralization takes place" (176). Klinkowitz's theory is then curiously applied to writers like Grace Paley. It is wonder- ful to see Paley receive such long-overdue critical attention; but surely Klinkowitz mis- reads Paley, who has repeatedly rejected the idea there are "purely artistic problems." Klinkowitz, who is hamstrung by his theory that "postmodern fiction disavows historical time entirely, depending upon no reference to the temporal world other than as one factor among many in composition," (162) cannot admit that Paley' s remarkable short fictions are very much grounded in the history of the American left, the woman's movement, and the domestic lives of women and children, even as they eschew conventional notions of linearity and plot. Instead, intent on proving how Paley's fiction "structures the void," Klinkowitz chooses to focus on Paley's unconventional "punctuation, [which forces] the reader to insert quotations, exclamation, and question marks and so experience these lines as text (virtually collaboration in the copy editing!) rather than simply ideas" (17). In doing so, Klinkowitz takes one of our most exciting writers, and makes her seem quite pedestrian. Moreover, by ignoring Paley's various ideological leanings, Klinkowitz betrays his disdain for "ideas," and for any kind of intellectualism in contemporary writing. Klinkowitz would be right to abhor ideas unconnected to characters' lives; but in contrast, he rejects the influence of intellectualism because for him "ideas" represent something outside the writer's own creation, hence his definition of "antihierarchal" fiction: "Antihierarchal means divesting signs of anthropomorphic qualities, and also of the intellectualism that censors out supposedly extraneous information to highlight what it considers central. Traditional realists would accumulate such details as a way of indicat- ing sensibility; neorealists posit nothing beyond the work itself and what can be derived from it" (173). The term "realist" here is a smokescreen: what Klinkowitz really objects to is the notion that writers use "ideas" as part of their craft. Klinkowitz thus claims very little for art, which is just the same as claiming too much. American Studies International, October 1997, Vol. XXXV, No. 3</page><page sequence="2">103 All of this is not to say that Klinkowitz misses the mark entirely. He does a great service to critics and readers of contemporary fiction by introducing two writers - Rob Swigart and Gerald Rosen- who have been largely ignored and who are powerful practi- tioners of what Klinkowitz calls the "California comic." Structuring the Void also contains an excellent section on Kurt Vonnegut, in which Klinkowitz shows how Vonnegut's novels are informed by various political and artistic movements of the thirties and sixties. Unlike much of the study, which rejects or ignores these influences, Klinkowitz argues that Vonnegut uses a variety of cultural sensibilities - popular songs, pacifism, slapstick film comedy - to construct his own textual meaning. This chapter on Vonnegut is the study's best, not because it is grounded in history (which it is not), but because it admits that Vonnegut has used and been nourished by "history" while asserting the primacy of his own fiction. Only in this chapter does Klinkowitz suggest that art, while guided its own aesthetic sensibility, can also inherit, interpret, and make meaning. Elsewhere, he com- mends art that, "rather than rail against the banality of contemporary life.. .accepts it as an occasion for light humor" (108). Much of contemporary fiction is commendable because it, as in the case of Paley, does not merely "rail against... banality"; but neither is it complacent about its ability to make something more of the world. In contrast, one fears that Klinkowitz is not really structuring' the void, but rather is comforted by it. -Brock Clarke, Cornell University</page></plain_text>
