STUART S. MILLER INTRODUCTION HALAKHIC SOURCES FROM THE talmudic era until the present fre- quently refer to the synagogue (bet keneset) and the house of study (bet midrash) in the same context, conveying the sense that the rabbis have always regarded the bet keneset as an institution akin to the academy. In- deed, rabbinic use of the phrase, "houses of assembly [i.e., synagogues] and houses of study" (batte kenestyot u-vatte nzidrashot) is so idiomatic one can only conclude that, whenever and wherever they lived, the rabbis perceived not only the bet midrash but also the bet keneset as under their influence and jurisdiction.' Despite this well entrenched rabbinic perspective, contemporary tradi- tional synagogues display a significant degree of liturgical, architectural, and artistic variation that oftentimes does not conform to recognized ha- I wish to thank Professor Lee I. Levine, who invited me to present my prelimi- nary thoughts on this topic before a Yale University faculty forum in March 2000. Professors Steven Fine of the University of Cincinnati, Jay Berkovitz of the University of Massachusetts, and Gary Rendsburg of Cornell University read earlier drafts of this study and offered welcome criticism, which compelled me to reconsider or further augment some of my views. 1. A simple search for rlo-rm Inni Mil:o= In in the Bar Ilan Judaic Li6raly data- base reveals that the phrase was in continuous use from antiquity to the present in contexts that suggest that the two institutions were often perceived as "rab- binic." For its use in talmudic sources, see the discussion below of yMeg 3, 74a and cf. S. S.

From the tal- mudic era to our own times, the rabbis have questioned synagogue practices that clashed with or even threatened some basic halakhic princi- ples. Of particular concern to the rabbis, surprising in view of its contin- ued prevalence today, has been the use of figurative art that might be construed either as a violation of the second commandment or of Ex 20:20 .. . you shall not make any gods of silver, nor shall you make for yourselves any gods of gold").3 Drawing upon earlier talmudic sources, medieval arbiters of ha/akhah (poskiin) struggled with such questions as whether depictions of animals (and humans) in synagogues should be seen as violations of the biblical proscriptions on imagery or, at the very least, as distractions from the concentration required for prayer.4 Most famously, R. Elyakim ben Joseph of Mainz (late twelfth century) re- 2. The variety found in construction of the mekitsah separating men and women in the orthodox synagogue comes readily to mind, but so do many liturgi- cal practices that are either not sanctioned or are outright prohibited by many or even most authorities. On the meehitsah, see B. Litvin, ed., The Sanctity of the Syna- gogue: The Case for Mechitzah - Separation between Men and Women tn the Synagogue - Baded on Jewidh Lawv, Hkitoly, and Philosophy, from Sources Old and New (3rd rev. ed., Hoboken, 1987). For a discussion of the interplay of custom (minhag) and rab- binic authority where liturgy is concerned, see R. Langer, To Worship God Propeerly: Tensions between Liturgical Custom and Halakhah tn Judaism (Cincinnati, 1998). Cf. D. Sperber, Minhage Yisra'el: Meqorot Ve-Toledot (7 vols., Jerusalem, 1990-2003), I: 20-38 and II: 76-125, who discusses halakhic responses to "wrongful custom" (mtnhag ta'ut) in general and includes several examples that pertain to the syna- gogue. 3. These concerns are raised already in tannaitic sources. See Mekhilta de-Rabbi YKih,nael, Yitro 6 and 10 (end). Cf. bAZ 42b-43b and see Maimonides, Mis hneb Torah, Avodat Kokhav'ini 3: 10-11 and his Sefer Hla-Mits'vot, Lo Ta 'aseh, 6. On Mai- monides' view, see D. Kotlar, Hla-'Onianut Ve-Ha-Dat (Jerusalem/Tel Aviv, 1971), 159. J. Guttmann, "The 'Second Commandment' and the Image in Judaism," HUCA 32 (1961): 161-174, questions whether the second commandment was adhered to strictly in the time of Philo and Josephus. Tanakh, A New Translation of the the Holy Scriptures according to the Traditional Heblrew Text (Philadelphia, 1985) has been consulted for the renderings of all biblical verses cited herein. 4. See the responsum of R. Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg (c. 1215-1293), ed., Prague 610, and especially the commentary of his disciple, R. Mordecai bar Hillel Ha-Kohen, Sefer Mordecai to bAZ 44a, sec. 839-840, who also discusses the use of figurative art in prayer books. Cf. S. Baron, The Jewid Community, Its History and Structure to the American Revolution (Philadelphia, 1948), II: 136-138, and V. B. Mann, ed., Jewids Texts on the Visual Arts (Cambridge, 2000), 39-42, who discusses the mid-twelfth-century responsum of R. Ephraim of Regensberg, who permitted textiles with animal figures to be used in the synagogue. R. Meir, R. Mordecai, and later, R. Joseph Karo (see n. 7) all cite the responsum of R. Ephraim.</page><page sequence="3">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 29 garded the images of lions and snakes depicted in the stained glass win- dows in the synagogue in Cologne as prohibited and ruled that they should be removed. R. Elyakim was none too subtle in making his point. He alludes to Hezekiah's destruction of the copper serpent that Moses had made (2 Kgs 18:3-4) as a precedent. Although the children of Israel offered incense to the serpent, according to talmudic tradition they were not yet guilty of idol worship.5 Nevertheless, R. Elyakim points out, the king's action was necessary as a precautionary measure, lest the people come to perceive the serpent as an idol and transgress.6 More permissive rulings would follow,7 but the concerns, often ex- pressed in pointed terms, would persist. As recently as the twentieth cen- tury, no less a halakhic authority than R. Eliezer Waldenberg (1917-) addressed the issue and further defined which animals and under what circumstances such artwork is either permitted or prohibited. Interest- ingly, R. Waldenberg adopted a rather strict, a priori position but was more lenient in situations in which the artwork had already been intro- duced into the synagogue.8 Similarly, the erstwhile, Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, R. I. Herzog (1888-1959), strenuously argued that the placing of an image of a lion or any other creature above a synagogue ark should be avoided altogether and suggested that only images of vegetative life or of implements that once belonged to the Temple (with the exception of the cherubim!) be used to adorn the bet keneset.9 Although R. Herzog conceded that he could not issue an outright prohibition because there were a considerable number of earlier authorities who were lenient on 5. See bAZ 44a. 6. The responsa is quoted by R. Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, 'Or Zaru'a, Avodah Zarab, 203, which is discussed in Mann, ed., Jeuwis Texts on the VsualArts, 71-75, and Kotlar, Ha-'Omanut Ve-Ha-Dat, 152-155. 7. See, especially, R. Joseph Karo, Avkat Rokhel 66, who allows the use of a parokhet (curtain for the Torah ark) that included images of birds. He refers to the earlier, twelfth-century responsum of R. Ephraim of Regensburg concerning woven coverings used in the synagogue that contained images of birds and horses. See above, n. 4. Here Karo takes a more lenient view than he does with regard to sculptures of lions. Cf. Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 141:1 and see below, n. 12. Also, see S. B. Freehof, A Treasury of Respona (Philadelphia, 1963), 108- 112, Mann, ed., Jeuwih Texts on the VKual Arts, 29-30, and 50-53. 8. See Ziz 'Eliezer, pt. 3, sec. 24. 9. According to Ez 1:10, the lion, along with the eagle, ox and man, was de- picted on the divine chariot, which is the reason for its prohibition. Cf. the res- ponsum of R. David ben Solomon ibn Zimra (Ridbaz), part 4, siman 107 and the comments of Rabbi Meir Padua (Maharam), quoted by R. Karo, Avkat Rokhel 65. Also, see below, n. 12.</page><page sequence="4">30 JQR 94:1 (2004) this issue, his principled opposition is self-evident.'0 Finally, the former Sefaradi Chief Rabbi of Israel, R. Ovadiah Yosef (1920-), issued a res- ponsum on the depiction of lions on the curtain of the ark or as sculpture placed above the ark. R. Yosef urges rabbis to teach publicly that these objects are prohibited and even to tactfully convince synagogue officials (qabba'cm) to remove them." It is not surprising that R. Yosef alludes to the earlier decision of R. Elyakim. Thus, despite the strong reservations of leading authorities, figurative stained glass windows and artwork have adorned synagogues since twelfth-century Europe and continue to be found in orthodox synagogues to this day.'2 Nevertheless, that the rabbis from time to time seem to lack influence, in this instance with regard to figurative art, is no indication that they were seen as peripheral or without authority over matters per- taining to the synagogue. The existence of vibrant responsa on this and many other issues indicates that, at least since medieval times, the rabbis were regarded as active participants in the very synagogue life they cri- 10. See his Hekblh Yits4iaq, 'Orab bayyin 1 1, where R. Herzog notes the strict- ness of many of "our sages, the great [experts in] balakal'a," and of the Sefaraditn in avoiding depictions of animals in the synagogue. He further explains that such use is a defamation of the name of God (billttl ba-Senem) since "our neighbors, the sons of Ishmael" are especially strict in these matters because "it bordered on idolatrous worship, and they know that they received from us their belief in the unity [of God] and the prohibition of images in general and in the synagogue in particular." Only later in the teshttvab, does R. Herzog admit that earlier authori- ties, including Maimonides, permitted images of animals including the lion and that "we have seen such images in our holy land as well as in many synagogues in the Diaspora, even among the ultra-orthodox in Lithuania and Poland." Cf. Kotlar, Ha-'Omanut Ve-Ha-Dat, 202-203. 11. Ye/Cave/5 Da'at 3:62. This is particularly interesting in light of R. Herzog's awareness of the position of the Sefaladim. See previous note. 12. Aside from the balakhtic sources alluded to above, n. 4, which mention the ruling of R. Elyakim pertaining to the synagogue at Cologne, see R. Joseph Karo, Avkat Rokbel 63, who objects to the placement of a sculpted stone lion on the ark in a synagogue. For this and other instances where the depiction of a lion became an issue, see Kotlar, Ha-'Onanut Ve-Ha-Dat, 175-177, and 180-182. Many a lion, albeit not of stone, adorn the ark in orthodox synagogues today! Interestingly, in a response to a query concerning an "altar" in an interfaith chapel that was opened in 1952 at Cornell University, R. J. B. Soloveitchik recognizes that, ex- cept for the human form, all types of figurative art have been introduced into the synagogue. See S. Fine, "Spirituality and the Art of the Ancient Synagogue," in Divine Law and Hutman Spirituality: Tlhe Orthodox Forum, ed. L. H. Schiffman and A. Mintz, (Northvale, N.J.), forthcoming, where R. Soloveitchik's letter is dis- cussed.</page><page sequence="5">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 31 tique.13 Indeed, it was precisely the complex interplay of local custom and rabbinic interpretation that resulted in halakhic interpretation and derivation.'4 That the "rabbinate" and the halakhic process have evolved consider- ably since the talmudic era is beyond question. Still, it is somewhat sur- prising that recent studies tend to regard the rabbis of the talmudic period as a numerically insignificant and insular group that had little influence, never mind control, over their fellow Jews. The discovery of ancient syn- agogues, particularly those with mosaic floors containing pagan imagery, has only furthered the impression that what went on in the synagogue, and much else, was in reality beyond the purview of rabbinic halakhah altogether. The rabbis, far from wielding the pervasive influence imag- ined by talmudic historians until the last third of the twentieth century, are now increasingly seen as peripheral to Jewish society and culture.'5 Indisputably, the dissonance created by the ancient mosaic synagogue floors, which contain zodiacs and depictions of Helios,16 has confounded scholars for some time. Both, the traditional approach, which maintained that the mosaics were a form of ornamentation that the rabbis came to tolerate, as well as the more extreme perspective, that the pagan themes 13. Aside from the many earlier responsa discussed by Kotler (see previous note), cf. the already referred to teshuvab of R. Waldenberg, where he describes a scenario in which, "if they inquire ... to paint images in the synagogue. The teshuvah of R. Herzog specifically states that he had seen the use of images with his own eyes (Inab she-ra'iti be- 'enat). He further prohibits, because of its origins in pagan mythology, an image of a lion with wings that had been submit- ted to him for his consideration. 14. See n. 2. 15. See below, especially n. 74. 16. Zodiac mosaics have been discovered in a number of synagogues. The earliest of these is in the fourth-century synagogue at Hammat Tiberias. Helios is clearly depicted (as Sol Invictus) at the center of this zodiac (see Figure 1) as well as in the one found at Bet Alfa, which dates to the time of Justin I (518-527 C.E.). The zodiac found in the ca. fifth-century synagogue at Na'aran is not well preserved, but it does have a depiction of Helios at its center. Very little remains at the center of the ca. sixth-century synagogue at Huseifa but it too may have contained a depiction of either the sun or Helios. The ca. fifth-century synagogue at Khirbet Susiya had a zodiac that was later transformed into a geometric design. The signs of the zodiac are listed but not illustrated in a fifth-century synagogue mosaic from En Gedi. See R. Hachlili, Anctent Jew?h Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel (Leiden, 1988), 301-309 and idem, "The Zodiac in Ancient Jewish Art: Representation and Significance," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 228 (1977): 61-77.

That is, could rabbinic Jews have understood these ideas and reconciled them with monotheistic per- ceptions? Special attention will be given to -the recently discovered fifth- century synagogue mosaic from Sepphoris, which has been subjected to all sorts of programmatic readings and interpretations. A comprehensive interpretation of this mosaic will not be attempted here. Rather, attention will be focused on its most blatant pagan themes-the zodiac and espe- cially the depiction of the sun at its center. The aim is to demonstrate that the rabbis of Late Antiquity brought their own unique monotheistic perceptions to what otherwise were pagan motifs, at Sepphoris and else- where. archaeological finds and rabbinic literature, see S. Fine, "'Jewish Archaeology': Between 'Erusin and Qiddushin," AJS Perdpectimem (fall-winter 2002): 12.</page><page sequence="8">34 JQR 94:1 (2004) In so doing, this study seeks to demonstrate that a more complex and dynamic relationship between the rabbis and their neighbors is likely to have existed in antiquity, just as it did later on. To be sure, the situation in the medieval and, certainly, the modern world is substantially different. Moreover, we do not have responsa literature for the talmudic period to provide insight into the interests of the Jews among whom the rabbis lived or into their relationship with the sages. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that rabbinic interest and involvement in many aspects of community prayer and in other matters pertaining to the synagogue in- creased, particularly by the alnoi-aic period. '8 After establishing that the "rabbis" of talmudic literature and those found in inscriptional evidence ("epigraphical rabbis"), including from synagogues, were likely to have had similar callings, I attempt to demon- strate that the worldview of these sages would easily have accommodated, or even assimilated, some of the most blatant pagan motifs found in syna- gogue mosaics. Indeed, these very motifs may reflect some of the rabbis' own thinking on the cosmos, which they shared with other Jews who were familiar with the biblical polemic concerning solar worship. If this assessment is accurate, the history of "the ancient synagogue" cannot serve as evidence for the marginality of the rabbis.19 Such a read- ing misinterprets and simplifies both the role of the rabbi and that of the synagogue in Jewish life in Late Antique Eretd Idrael. While the function of the rabbi has surely changed since antiquity, the one constant that remains is that a "rabbi" is a teacher of Torah in all its senses. Syna- gogues, then as now, addressed the need for communal worship and at- tracted Jews of different backgrounds, professions, and perspectives. As we shall see, while some rabbis in Eretd Idrael in talmudic times may have preferred worshipping within the bet nzidlrad, or perhaps within syna- gogues of their own, many others were known to have frequented a local bet keneset. Their roles in these synagogues varied from ordinary worship- per to that of honored teacher. The rabbis of antiquity were evidently just one more element of a multifaceted Jewish community and society that helped shape the history of the synagogue. 18. See, for example, L. I. Levine, Tlhe Ancient Syiagogoue: Tlhe First Tlholuand Years (New Haven, Conn., 2000), 440-470, who maintains that rabbinic involve- ment increased in the third and fourth centuries. Similarly, D. Levine, "Mi Hish- tattef be-Seder Ha-Ta'anit bi-Rehovah shel 'Ir: Ta'anit ha-Tsibbur be-'Erets Yisra'el ba-Me'ah ha-Shelishit ve-ha-Revi'it," Catlhedra 94 (1999): 33-54, dis- cusses the increased role of the sages in communal fast-day ceremonies beginning with the time of R. Judah ha-Nasi. 19. The ancient synagogue should by no means, however, be viewed as a mo- nolithic institution. See discussion below.</page><page sequence="9">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 35 AMORAIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE SYNAGOGUE Two views, found in the Palestinian Talmud and assigned to third-century amoraim, reflect diametrically opposite views of the rabbis toward syna- gogues. The first appears in yMegillah 3, 74a:20 R. Hiyya and R. Yisa would be received [as boarders] in the syna- gogue [kenilhta 1. R. Immi ordered the teachers [of schoolchildren within the synagogue], "If a learned person [rr1n1: 1L72:L7&amp;1] comes to you, welcome him together with his donkeys and his clothes." R. Be- rachiah went to the synagogue of Bet Shean and saw a person washing his hands and feet at the stone bath [there]. He [R. Berachiah] said to him, "It is prohibited!" The next day he [the man] saw him [R. Be- rachiah] washing his hands and feet at the stone bath. He said to him, "Rabbi, for you it is permitted but for me it is prohibited?" [R. Berach- iah] said, "That's right!" [To which the other responded,] "Why?" He [R. Berachiah] responded, "Thus R. Joshua ben Levi said, 'Syna- gogues and batte midrashbot are for the sages [Vakbanim] and their disciples.' The view attributed here to R. Joshua ben Levi, and capitalized on by R. Berachiah, unequivocally has the bwakhami'm and their disciples (talmide- htem) appropriate the synagogue. Those who study Torah, the passage contends, are entitled to make use of the facilities belonging to the syna- gogue as well as those of the batte midrasbot. Both institutions are associ- ated with Torah, so those who devote their lives to Torah had the right to make themselves at home therein. The other view, which appears in yPeah 8, 2 lb, would have us believe that the synagogue was not so readily associated with study of Torah. At least one third-century rabbi, therefore, wvas disinclined to view the build- ing of synagogues as especially meritorious:22 20.

Hama bar Hanina and R. Hoshaya were walking among those synagogues of Lod. R. Hama bar Hanina said to R. Hos- haya, "How much money my fathers [i.e., ancestors] invested here." He replied to him, "How many souls have your fathers invested here? Were there no people studying Torah?" R. Hoshaya's reaction to the prideful boast of R. Hama bar Hanina re- flects a very different attitude than that of R. Berachiah and R. Joshua ben Levi at yMeg 3, 74a. R. Hoshaya would much rather have the masses (bene nash) invest their time in the study of Torah than in acquiring assets for the building of synagogues.23 Our appreciation of such contradictory views is made more compli- cated by the rich archaeological finds, which include, aside from the al- ready mentioned zodiacs and depictions of Helios, surprising figurative art and, especially but not exclusively in the Diaspora, inscriptional refer- ences to functionaries other than rabbis. Yet rabbis also appear in dedica- tory inscriptions, not one of whom is known to us from talmudic literature. This convenient fact has enabled S. J. D. Cohen to suggest that the title "rabbi" is merely an honorific title in these instances and, in any event, those so designated do not appear to have done much more than contribute funds to the synagogue.24 We shall return to these "epi- graphical rabbis," who, Cohen claims, had no connection to the sages of 23. See also, yShebi'it 4, 35c where R. Yonah states in the name of R. Hiyya bar R. Ashi that, in the future world, baverini will go "from strength to strength" (Ps 84:8), since they will continue to take pains to go from the bet kenzeset to the bet inidrash. This passage also emphasizes that botb the bet keneset and the bet mid- rash were places where Torah was studied. See, however, H. Lapin, "Jewish and Christian Academies in Roman Palestine: Some Preliminary Observations," in Cae,area Marituna: A Retrospective after Two Mil-lelLa, ed. A. Raban and K. G. Holum (Leiden, 1996), 509, who maintains that the passage "valorizes" the bet lntdra,'a over the synagogue. The allusion to Ps 84:8 argues against this under- standing, as does the parallel assigned to R. Levi at bMK 29a, where one goes back and forth between the bet Inidras/ and the synagogue. bBeluakhot 64a has yet another version assigned to R. Levi, this time implying that it is meritorious to go from the prayer of the synagogue to the study of Torah in the bet nidrcaib. See Aggadot Aaharsba, ad loc. Both parallels in the Bavli simply have R. Hiyya resort to Ps 84:8 to prove that the talnide bakhanuitn will have no rest in this world or the next. The end of the verse, "appearing before God in Zion," is understood as an allusion to the future world, that is, where scholars will continue to engage in stury. This part of the verse is not necessarily a specific allusion to the bet tnidrash as opposed to the synagogue, as Lapin maintains. 24. S. J. D. Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," JQR 72.1 (1981): 1-17.</page><page sequence="11">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 37 talmudic literature and exerted no real control over the synagogues to which they contributed.25 This interest in rabbinic "control" of ancient synagogues has persisted. In a more recent study, Cohen further concludes that "aside from the syna- gogue of Rehov, with a piece of the Yerusbalmt spelled out in mosaic tile on its floor, not a single synagogue excavated in the land of Israel is demon- strably rabbinic."26 T. Zahavy documents increasing interest of the rabbis in the synagogue but asserts "other social classes or professional groups controlled them [the synagogues]."27 He concludes that the dearth of rab- binic sources dealing with the synagogue per se points to "the limitation of rabbinic control and interest in synagogue administration even down through the fifth century."28 L. I. Levine, who has presented the most far- reaching study of "the ancient synagogue," concurs with this assessment. Levine argues that rabbinic involvement in synagogue matters increased during the third and fourth centuries in some respects, but overall "the rabbis were far from being in control [emphasis mine] of this institution."29 I recently suggested that "control" of the synagogue is hardly the issue and that the real question is whether and to what degree the views of the rabbis either influenced or are reflected in synagogue life. This undoubt- edly varied from place to place. The point is that the synagogue should not be seen as an institution whose form and function were monolithic.30 In some synagogues rabbis could have had a say where the liturgy and ritual were concerned without necessarily controlling or running the in- stitution.31 25.

She goes on to assert that this question is wrongly projected upon the synagogues of late antiquity and really is "asked in the light of the structure of modern Jewish communities where rabbis occupy leadership positions."</page><page sequence="12">38 JQR 94:1 (2004) It is for this reason that I have suggested that the writing of the history of "the" ancient synagogue is faulty if undue weight is given to archaeo- logical sources.32 The upwards of one hundred synagogue discoveries in Erets Israel, as important as they may be, are only part of the story. The largest of these synagogues could accommodate perhaps a couple hun- dred people and, in any event, more than one such structure is rarely ever found at a given site. Either fewer Jews than is customarily thought prayed in synagogues (or at all), or the structures that have survived are not representative of the vast majority of synagogues, which could not stand the ravages of time, and will never be discovered.33 While I have tried to show that rabbinic traditions that assign an exceedingly large number of synagogues to Second Temple Jerusalem and to other places later on should not be taken literally, it is likely that there indeed were a good number of synagogues in the larger towns of Ereta Israel. The report concerning eighteen kenilibtan at Sepphoris has been wrongly understood to mean that there was that number of synagogues in the city during the time of R. Judah Ha-Nasi. However, that Sepphoris had more than a single "Great Synagogue" by the anioraic period is evident from other rabbinic reports.34 Similarly, the tradition of thirteen synagogues at Tib- erias may be using the figure in a hyperbolic fashion, but there is every reason to believe that there were a significant number of batte keneset in this town, certainly more than the archaeological remains to date indi- cate.35 Furthermore, the sense one gets from the rabbinic evidence is that the rabbis often preferred praying "between the columns" of their batte mid- rashb and that semiprivate synagogues belonging either to individuals or to people who opted to pray together because they emanated from the same place were common.36 Many of these synagogues would have been more modest than the structures that have been found. Some may very well have resembled homes rather than more formal public gathering places. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that even the wealthiest towns could 32.

If the ancient synagogues enjoyed a long stylistic evolution, which now appears certain, there is no reason why the more simple structures associated with the Second Temple period and early centuries C.E. would have disap- peared once the more ornate batte keneset began to appear, beginning, at the earliest, in the third century. We only need to look to contemporary Jerusalem (or Brooklyn!) for variety in synagogue architecture, from houses adapted for worship to the "Great Synagogue" -with many other types in between.37 Seldom did the synagogues the rabbis attended leave much of an aesthetic impression in the literary record.38 The rabbis were substantially more interested in the substance of prayer. After all, the venue for worship was largely peripheral to the liturgy and the rituals it entailed. Nevertheless, we would expect more frequent allusions to the magnificent edifices in the towns in which the rabbis lived, especially if they were adorned with objectionable images or design. On the other hand, that the arrangement, orientation and, later on, artwork of so many of the archaeological synagogues appear to flout balakbab or, at least, presumed theological sensitivities of the rabbis does not necessarily mean that the sages or rabbinic Jews would have avoided such places alto- gether. Indeed, despite the sentiment attributed to R. Hoshaya in the passage quoted above and only a few warnings concerning the bebavr'or of the 'amme ba-'arets in their places of worship, there are remarkably few expressions of consternation toward synagogues the rabbis found objec- tionable.39 "EPIGRAPHICAL RABBIS" RECONSIDERED The issue of the identity of the rabbis who appear in synagogue inscrip- tions is obviously relevant to this discussion.40 If these rabbis were even 37. Cf. Miller, "On the Number of Synagogues in the Cities of 'Erez Israel," 66. 38. When the rabbis do comment on the magnificence of a single structure it is the double colonnade (dyplastoon) that served as a synagogue in Alexandria! See tSuk 4:6; ySuk 5, 55a-b; and bSuk 51b and the discussion in Levine, The Ancient Synagogue, 84-89, and S. Fine, This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Syna- gogue during the Greco-Roman Period (Notre Dame, 1997), 43-45. 39. It is certainly curious that the concern attributed to the first century tanna, R. Dosa ben Hyrcanus, in mAvot 3:10, pertains to the behavior of the 'amme ha- arets within their synagogues, and not to any problems the sages may have had with the structure per se. The same applies to the sentiment expressed in bShab 32a. Cf. Levine, The Ancient Synagogue, 192-193. 40. See my preliminary observations, "The Rabbis and the Non-Existent Mo- nolithic Synagogue," 61-63, which I expand upon here.</page><page sequence="14">40 JQR 94:1 (2004) remotely connected to the sages of talmudic literature, their association with synagogues containing pagan images and figurative art, might sug- gest a degree of accommodation on the part of the talmudic rabbis to seemingly threatening notions. One of Cohen's main arguments for considering the term "rabbi" in inscriptions as an honorific title is that not a single one of these "rabbis" can be securely identified with sages known to us from rabbinic sources. Moreover, he argues, their names are frequently found in contexts that suggest a high degree of Hellenization.4' Still, one inscription, which ap- pears on a lintel from Dabbura in the Golan, alludes to Rabbi Eleazar Ha-Kappar. This may or may not be the tanna by that name, but the inscription specifically refers to the bet midrasb of a person named R. Eleazar Ha-Kappar.42 With the one exception perhaps of Ben Sira 51:23, the institution known as a bet midrasb is otherwise only found in talmudic literature, where it is most frequently a place where Torah is studied and taught by rabb,?. Indeed, the phrase bet niidrasb was undoubtedly derived from the exposition of Torah that these very rabbis were known for, and which is so often introduced in rabbinic sources by the word derasb/dara.b ("to expound").43 41. S. J. D. Cohen questions whether indeed the R. Eliezer Ha-Kappar who is mentioned along with his bet midrads in an inscription from Dabbura is to be identified with the tanna by that name. See "Epigraphical Rabbis," 3 and 11, and my following note. Cohen also dismisses the possibility that inscriptions that refer to a R. Joshua ben Levi, R. Yudan bar Tryphon, and Yudan bar Simeon, refer to similarly named individuals in talmudic literature. In an addendum, he notes that he learned too late of the Golan inscription that alludes to Rabbi Abun. Cohen's reasonable criteria, however, that is, that we know the "epigraphical" rabbi's origins and the name of his offspring before making such identifications, would also make it hard to identify this R. Abun with the anmora by that name. S. Safrai, "The Holy Congregation in Jerusalem," Scr'pta Hierosolylnitana 23 (1972), 76-77, believes that an obscure talmudic sage known as R. Samuel Phregrita appears in an inscription from Jerusalem. Cf. Cohen, 6. 42. See previous note and especially D.

Eleazar of the inscription is to be identified with the tanna also known as Bar Kappara. 43.

Those syna- gogue inscriptions that can be dated are by and large later than the tannatm and amoraim of talmudic sources from Erets Israel. That would at least explain why the "rabbis" of synagogue inscriptions are unknown to talmudic sources. As for the epitaphs, especially those from Bet Shearim, there is good reason to think of them also as referring to teachers of Torah similar to those who bore the title in the Mishnah and Talmud. The clustering at Bet Shearim of inscriptions that include figures who are referred to as rabbis would suggest that this title was meant to convey something more significant than that these persons were honorable.44 These rabbis are surrounded by imagery that was presumably offensive to "rabbis," but their own tombs were not marked by Greek epigrams.45 Three of the graves have been thought to belong to known rabbinic fig- ures who were associated with the patriarchal house in the third cen- tury.46 True, their epitaphs include Greek, but then, a tannaitic source already insists that the house of Rabban Gamaliel was allowed to teach Greek to its children because of the patriarch's relationship to the Roman rulers.47 Antoratc sources reiterate this tradition and have descendants of Gamaliel emphasize the importance of knowledge of Greek.48 Hezser is surely correct that the families of the deceased rabbis could have been responsible for the language of the epitaphs and the decorations on the tombs.49 Even if the three names thought to belong to the patriarchal 44.

Would we not expect the sages of the Talmud to have expressed some consternation that "not all rabbis were Rabbis?"52 After all, these "real" rabbis gave serious import to the title "tabbi." This is already evident in a tannaitic passage, tBM 2:30, where rav is applied to various types of masters:53 Who is "his master" (ravo)? A master who teaches him Torah, but not one who teaches him a craft. And who is this master?54-A master who teaches him, and shows him the way [in Torah] at the outset. R. Meir says, "A master who imparts bokbMab, but not one who [only] teaches Scripture [niktra." R. Judah says, "Anyone from whom one gains the bulk of his [theoretical] knowledge [talnudo]." R. Yusah [Yose] says, "Anyone who enlightens one with his [knowledge of] oral Torah [mnu- nato] . " The material leading up to this passage asserts, as does mBM. 2:11, that one is to return a lost object belonging to one's master before returning a 50. For a full treatment of this frequently misunderstood passage, see Miller, "On the Number of Synagogues in the Cities of 'E,'ez Israel," 59-63. 51. L. I. Levine, The Rabbinic Class of Roman Palestine in Late Antiquity (Jerusa- lem and New York, 1989), 49 n. 32, agrees with Cohen that the epigraphical rabbis are not to be identified with the sages of the Talmud and suggests instead that some of those who appear in epitaphs at Bet Shearim were connected with patriarchal circles rather than with the rabbis responsible for talmudic literature. It should be remembered, however, that rabbinic sources present the patriarchs as rabbis who teach Torah, and play a major role in the tannaitic period, culminat- ing in the formulation of the Mishnah under R. Judah Ha-Nasi. Respect among the rabbis (despite occasional criticism) for the patriarchal house would persist well past the time of Judah Ha-Nasi. Finally, Judah himself is referred to simply as "Rabbi," which was certainly more than an honorary title where he was con- cerned. 52. To borrow a phrase from Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," 12. 53.

The Tosefta (2:30) adds that if the father also happens to be "equally his master" then his lost goods are given priority. While most manuscripts of the Mishnah read similarly, the printed editions have, instead, "if the father also happens to be a sage (hakham)," which is certainly the intention from the context.55 Although our passage acknowledges that a master could be one who imparts a craft to another, there is little interest in this type of rav. Attention is immedi- ately shifted to the rav who teaches Torah in some form or another.56 Each of the three tannaim whose opinions is presented share the view that a rav is someone who imparts Torah, whether written (mikra'), oral (mishnab), or the theoretical reasoning behind the latter (taltnud).57 Cohen rightly points out that this passage assumes that the title rav was applied even to a "master craftsman."58 What is essential, however, is that the rav is a teacl,er.59 While that might include one who imparts a craft, at least 55. Cf. Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fefhutah, Seder Nezikin (New York, 1988), 168, to lines 75-76. 56. This is especially evident in the amoraic formulations of this /araita. See yBM 2, 8d; and yHor 3, 48b. 57. Note tSot 7:21, where Prov 24:27 is understood to imply a similar classi- fication of types of Torah knowledge. For "talmud" as the reasoning behind nzishnah, see H. Albeck, Mavo'La-Talnudim (Tel Aviv, 1969), 3-4. The view at- tributed to R. Meir obviously understands bokbnmab as going beyond miktra but still "Torah." See Rashi to the parallel at bBM 33a, kol she-rov bokblnato bemennu, where he explains that bokbmab could be mikra' mijhnab, or gemara (following the usages in the passage, ad loc.). Cf. yHor 3, 48b, where bokblnab is equated with niijhnah and talmud and yHor 3, 48c where R. Samuel bar Nahman identifies hokhbnah in Pro 4:5 with nuchnah. 58. "The Rabbi in Second-Century Jewish Society," 924, where Cohen also claims that rabbi is used to designate a "brigand chieftain" at bBM 84a. This passage he is referring to is an aggadic narration of how R. Yohanan met and compelled Resh Laqish to study Torah. Alluding to his former life, Resh Laqish states, "There (among the brigands) they called me 'rabbi' and here they call me 'rabbi.' Not too much should be made of this ironic statement appearing as it does in a highly stylized Babylonian formulation. In any event, the contrast Resh Laqish draws is between the teacher of Torah he has now become to the teacher of thieves that he once was. See, however, the curious understanding of To4afot, ad loc., where it is assumed that Resh Laqish was once knowledgeable in Torah and deserved the title rabbi but had turned away from it only to return and earn the title once again under Yohanan's tutelage! 59. This is certainly the understanding of the statement attributed to Rabban Gamaliel in mAvot 1:16: "Assign yourself a rav." Interestingly, in biblical and ancient Near Eastern literature, rav often means "chief" or "master" and is usu- ally used in construct with other terms, to designate, for example, the "chief of the guard," the "chief sailor," or the "chief baker." It is likely that the term origi- nally had a less specific and dependent meaning and with time took on the more</page><page sequence="18">44 JQR 94:1 (2004) from the point of view of the rabbis, the rav who deserved respect-and the title, rav/rabt'i-was one who taught Torah in any of its forms. We might expect that rabbis who maintained this perspective and who lived or worked alongside "epigraphical rabbis" in places like Sepphoris, Hammat Gader, or Bet Shearim would have taken exception and ex- pressed their resentment! At the very least, the editors of the talmudic writings would have regarded these other "rabbis" as phonies and ex- posed them as rabbis in title only. When questions of appointments and promotion arise in rabbinic circles, other titles and means are resorted to to indicate that one had not fully earned the title of "rabbi." The assump- tion in these instances is that the individual's knowledge of Torah was insufficient.60 Are we to assume that epigraphical rabbis were devoid of Torah and never crossed paths with the sages (i.e., "rabbis") of talmudic literature? It makes more sense that many did come into contact with the talmudic sages and did not elicit their consternation precisely because they were intimately connected to their world. Admittedly, t-av/rabbi is used in (much) later parlance as a respectful way of addressing someone, but it is not clear that a similar usage of "rabbi" was customary and, more importantly, common, in Late Antiq- uity. In any event, what may have become a familiar term of respect in Hebrew and Jewish parlance, would not have been utilized in inscrip- formal usage found in rabbinic literature. Someone who "mastered" a skill or subject would eventually have been turned to as a teacber and would simply be called "rav" or "rabbi." On the use of I-av in the Tanakb and in other ancient Near Eastern documents, see H. Shanks, "Origins of the Title 'Rabbi'," which is conveniently reproduced along with his debate with S. Zeitlin over the use of "rabbi" in the New Testament, in J. Z. Dimitrovsky, ed., Exploring the Talmud (New York, 1976), 177-182. 60. See the use of the term bak/inl ("sage") in yTa'an 4, 68a, which I discuss in my, "R. Hanina bar Hama at Sepphoris, The Galilee in Late Antiquity, ed. Levine, 195. Cf. the parallel at EccIejiaftes Rahhah 7:7 which has zaken ("elder") instead of bakim and yMK 3, 81c, where zaken is similarly used with reference to Bar Kap- para, who is deprived of an appointment (with the title rabbi?) because of a prank he pulled on Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi. Evidently, teachers of Torah did not always bear the title of rabbi, nor were they expected to. Cf. the story of Levi ben Sisi at yYev 12, 13a and Genesis Rabbah 81:2 (Theodor-Albeck, 969-972). At the same time, the rabbis objected to the frivolous assigning of the title to those who did not deserve it or to those who "were appointed for money." See especially Leviti- cLI Rabbab 23:4 (= Song of Songs Rabbah 2:2) and yBik 3, 65d. Cf. the discussion of Hezser, The Soctal Strutcture of the Ra6tinic Mov'ement in Romaln Palestine, 111-112, who argues that these persons often included "rabbis" with whom other sages disagreed and not individuals who were ignorant of Torah altogether. Hezser, 255-306, also considers the evidence for stratification within the rabbinic move- ment, including the various applications of zaken.</page><page sequence="19">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 45 tions in this fashion. The written record, including talmudic literature, but especially mosaic inscriptions and epitaphs (as opposed, say, to amu- lets, where the term also appears)61 is considerably more formal (and permanent!) than the spoken. Would the term "rabbi" have been repeat- edly used in such formal contexts in an informal sense? I think not. Moreover, a number of inscriptions, both from synagogues and epi- taphs, produce alongside "rabbi" other titles that cannot possibly be con- strued as anything but formal usages. One such term is beribb6i which talmudic literature applies to persons with unparalleled knowledge of ba- lakhalh, such as R. Yose ben Halafta, the great tanna of second-century Sepphoris or R. Hoshaya "Beribbi," whose knowledge was said to have been endless and incomparable, similar to that of another great rabbi, Meir, "in his generation."62 Although it does not refer to a formal office or position, beribbi is consistently used in talmudic literature to single out extraordinary rabbis.63 The term also appears following the names of rab- bis in both Aramaic and Greek epitaphs and synagogue inscriptions.64 Even more persuasive is the designation for "priest," which also appears, alongside "rabbi," in both types of inscriptional evidence, as Hebrew kohen or Greek hierus, which could only have applied to someone of priestly descent.65 Finally, a Greek epitaph from Bet Shearim refers to 61. See J. Naveh and S. Shaked, Amulets and Magtc Bowl,: Aramatc Incantations of Late Antiquity (Jerusalem, 1985), 50-54, for an amulet from Horvat Kanaf that refers to R. Eleazar son of Esther (1), who is described as a "servant to the God of Heaven." Cf. Hezser, The Social Structure of the Rabbinic Movement tn Roman Palestine, 121-123. While the amulet per se does not make R. Eleazar a teacher, it is curious that his name is repeated several times without the title "rabbi" after it is introduced with the title. 62. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel calls Yose "beribbi," at tBer 5:2 in evident recog- nition of his balakbthc knowledge. Cf. tDemai 3:14, tSuk 2:2 and the sources men- tioned in my "The Rabbis and the Non-Existent Monolithic Synagogue," 67-68 n. 46. Traditions pertaining to the extraordinary knowledge of R. Hoshaya "Be- ribbi" are attributed to R. Yohanan in bEruv 53a. Cf. Rashi, ad loc. Others, in- cluding R. Eleazar Ha-Kappar (see nn. 41 and 42) also bear this title. For Eleazar, see bHul 5b, 84b and bAZ 43a. 63. Cf. the comments of R Yehezkel Landau, Sbe'elot U-TeshbuvotNoda'BI-Yebu- dah, mahadura' tinyana' Orab .Hayyim, 103, on the use of the title to signify distinc- tion. 64. Miller, "The Rabbis and the Non-Existent Monolithic Synagogue," 62. 65. See especially the inscription from the Khirbet Susiya synagogue, which mentions two rabbis who bear the additional titles of kohen and beribbi. One of these is also called sofer ("scribe"). Cf. the references and discussion in "The Rabbis and the Non-Existent Monolithic Synagogue," 68 n.48. Even a relative or descendant of a priest was noteworthy. See M. Schwabe and B. Lifshitz, Beth Sbe'arim II, The Greek Ilscriptiond (New Brunswick, N.J., 1974), 42-43, for an</page><page sequence="20">46 JQR 94:1 (2004) "Leontios, father of Rabbi Paregorius and Julianus palatinwi, of the gold- smiths."66 The title palatinwi designated a member of the central bureau- cracy of the Later Roman Empire, in this case perhaps a treasury official.67 Should we assume that Julianus held an official position whereas his brother, Paregorius, was merely a "rabbi"? We are left with only one possible conclusion-that the term "rabbi" in many if not most instances was used to refer to someone who taught Torah (written or oral) and had students who referred to him in this manner.68 Cohen draws too sharp a distinction when he concludes that there were "Rabbis" who were responsible for talmudic literature and others, the epigraphical "rabbis," who simply bore a nontechnical, honor- ific title. The written and material evidence should not be seen as repre- sentative of entirely distinct worlds in this instance. Indeed, Cohen admits that even among the rabbis mentioned in the Talmud there were those with diverse interests and expertises. He is also correct that there was nothing to prevent someone from referring to somebody else as "rabbi. "69 However, it would be quite incredible if the rabbis who appear in con- epitaph in which a woman is titled qrtQua, apparently the equivalent of Hebrew kohenet, which in this instance is the wife of a priest (kohen). A similar usage has been found in a pre-70, Greek epitaph from Jerusalem. See T. Ilan, "New Ossu- ary Inscriptions from Jerusalem," Scripta Claica Israelica 11 (1992): 157-159. M. Williams, "The Contribution of Jewish Inscriptions to the Study of Judaism," The Cambridge History of Judaism, ed. Horbury, Davies, and Sturdy, 80 n. 26., regards this as proof that a female cultic official, rather than a relative of a priest, cannot possibly have been intended. A female official in the Temple cult is not likely. 66. See Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," 4, and Schwabe and Lifshitz, Beth Sbe'arim II, The Greek Inscriptions, 40-41. 67. See Schwabe and Lifshitz, ibid., and cf. A. H. M. Jones, The Laterl Roman Empire, 284-602: A Social, Economi, and Administrative Survey (Norman, Okla., 1964), 572-86. 68. Cf. Hezser, The Social Structure of the Rabbinic Movelnent tn Roman Palestine, 61-62, and especially 490-91, where she discusses the boundaries of the rabbinic movement. This is not to say that other types of expertise or knowledge could not have been recognized by the assigning of the title "rabbi." The usual under- standing of rabbi as "my master," meaning in the study and teaching of Torah, may be one-sided, coming, as it does, from talmudic-rabbinic sources, but we have little else to go on. No other source clearly defines the title or assigns to it a distinct meaning. The fact that there was no control over who called whom rabbi (i.e., "my teacher") and that there were some rabbis who may have been more receptive to Hellenistic culture is not sufficient for disassociating the epigraphical rabbis from those of talmudic literature. They too were considered teachers by someone. 69.

It is equally inconceivable that only the rabbis explicitly mentioned in the Talmud had a role in its creation. Surely, there were others. Indeed, talmudic sources make this abundantly clear. True, they only assign the title "rabbi" to a few hundred named individuals.70 However, others are grouped together and are referred to collectively as rabbanan ("masters" or "our masters"). 71 Still others who taught Torah (in its many senses) and belonged to rabbinic circles are designated by collective ru- brics. These included scholars who belonged to the iletn de-ve- ("those of the house of," especially de-ve-rabbi Yannat), to the /avraya' ("associates"), and, as I have attempted to show elsewhere, to the Zippora'e, Tibera'e, and Deroma'e ("Sepphoreans," "Tiberians," and "Southerners").72 Moreover, as S. Lieberman has shown, Sifre Zuta' applies the title "rabbi" to many tannainm who are otherwise unknown in talmudic literature.73 The rabbinic movement may not have been as extensive and as ubiquitous as was once thought, but claims that it was an exclusive group that lacked any signifi- cant larger influence seem simplistic.74 If indeed, many an "epigraphical 70.

THE SEPPHORIS SYNAGOGUE MOSAIC, PSALM 19, AND THE RABBIS This is not to say that the rabbis dominated the society in which they lived. All too often, however, the evidence is approached with either-or presuppositions such as whether or not the synagogue was a rabbinic institution. A variation on this theme is also heard: whether or not some synagogues (those of En Gedi and Rehov, for example) can be designated as rabbinic, as opposed to those that arguably belonged to others (Ham- mat Tiberias, Bet Alpha). These are interesting questions, but they do not allow for nuance.75 Elsewhere I have tried to demonstrate that the picture of ritual purity life as well as worship that is emerging from archaeologi- cal sources points to widespread Jewish observance that at times is re- flective, and at other times only partially so, of the views of the rabbis.76 It is remarkably easy to point to material finds that are at odds with rabbinic halakhah. At the same time, a too facile connection with discover- ies that seemingly concur with the views of the rabbis can easily lead to the conclusion that the rabbis influenced or were responsible for a partic- ular practice or institution. The extent to which popular practice played that the rabbis competed with other "Jewish Big Men" in amnoraic times. More nuanced is the approach of H. Lapin, "Rabbis and Cities in Later Roman Pales- tine: The Literary Evidence," JJS 50.2 (1999): 187-205, who views the rabbis as an urban elite and discusses the implications of that finding for the extent of their influence. For a very different approach to the rabbis and cities, see B. Z. Rosen- feld, Mekomot Mofhavam Shel Ha-Hakhamtm Ba-Galil, 70-400: Pertferyah mul Mer- kaz, HUCA 69 (1998): 57-102. Levine, The Rabbinic Clas of Ronman Palestine in Late Antiquity, 98-133, and, especially, 192, attempts to demonstrate those areas where the rabbis had significant interactions with others. Levine rejects a romanticized view of the role of the rabbis in society. Although he sees the rabbis as an elite religious group, he also rejects the notion that they were peripheral to Jewish society. More recently, Hezser, The Social Structure of tlhe Rabbinic Movement tn Roman PaleAtine, 307-325, argues that the rabbis functioned as a "personal alli- ance system" and tries to define the their influence by resorting to network the- ory. This would appear to be a more fruitful approach. See also my "Sages and Commoners in Late Antique 'Erez Israel." 75. I am hoping to expand upon this theme in a forthcoming review of recent synagogue research to appear in JQR. 76.

Thus it might be more accurate to speak of a dynamic whereby popular practices and beliefs at times found expression in rabbinic halakhah and at other times were moderated by the rulings of the rabbis, but it is often impossible to determine with certainty which was the case. In yet other instances, popular and rabbinic practices and institutions may have had no influence whatsoever upon one another and could very well have existed, however uneasily, side by side. Still, a more likely scenario is that of a vibrant, if sometimes subtle, interplay of rabbinic and nonrabbinic culture. Talmudic literature testifies to this very phenomenon. Despite the am- biguity expressed toward "the synagogue" in the above quoted sources from the Palestinian Talmud, the rabbis, especially those of the third and fourth centuries, were very much at home in some synagogues that were not exclusively rabbinic places of worship. For example, the third-cen- tury amora, R. Yohanan, is depicted lecturing to a group that included a mc in the "Great Synagogue of Sepphoris" (keni?bta' rab6ata' de-tl'p- porin)77 Yohanan is also found by an archon absorbed in his studies before the "Synagogue of the Babylonians" at Sepphoris (kenisbta' de-Bav1a'e be- Tsipporin).78 Judah Ha-Nasi studies Torah before this synagogue, and R. Hiiyya once is in the vicinity and hears children expounding a verse there.79 The synagogue of the Babylonians is also treated as a landmark of sorts by the rabbis, who allude to it to make a halakhic point. A story involving a synagogue at Sepphoris that appears to have been associated with emigres from the Judean town of Gofnah (kenisbta' de-Gofnah de Tsipporin) is similarly referred to in order to emphasize a halakhic posi- tion.80 The rabbis obviously were comfortable with and within many a synagogue in Sepphoris. This undoubtedly was the case elsewhere as well.8' Moreover, when we turn to the later epigraphic evidence we see that individual "rabbis" who are otherwise unknown are named in syna- gogue inscriptions from Naaran and Khirbet Sussiya, both of which have 77.

Nevertheless, several other sources allude to third-century sages teaching in synagogues in Tiberias, where they appear to be</page><page sequence="24">50 JQR 94:1 (2004) zodiac remains, and Hammat Gader.82 The term beri2bbi which, I have argued also testifies to a "rabbinic" figure, is used at both Khirbet Sussiya and at Bet Alpha.83 At En Gedi, another unknown rabbi appears in a mosaic that names the signs of the zodiac.8' This is not to say that many if not most rabbis would have felt equally at home in all synagogues or that they did not prefer worshipping in their own batte keneset or batte nddrabh.85 However, if the claim made here, that is, that the rabbis of epigraphy and those of talmudic literature often functioned as "rabbis" in a similar sense, is correct, then it is legitimate to ask how these rabbis would have related to symbols that seenz to be at odds with their world. The situation at Sepphoris is particularly advanta- geous for such an inquiry. Aside from the literary references to specific synagogues that the rabbis attended at Sepphoris, there are archaeologi- cal remains of at least two others, dating to the early post-talmudic period. One of these includes a mosaic inscription with a dedication to Rabbi Yudan bar Tanhum. The somewhat later fifth-century synagogue floor with a zodiac discovered a few years ago has figures who may belong to this same family but curiously lack the title "rabbi."86 In fact, none of the names in this synagogue floor include the title "rabbi." Several frames in this later mosaic from Sepphoris do, however, sug- gest that the artist was aware of rabbinic tradition. For example, the de- piction of the first fruits (bikkkurin) in a basket from whose sides hang two birds (Figure 3) is reminiscent of mBik 3:5, which clearly alludes to the practice, in Temple times, of adorning the basket containing the seven species of fruits with young birds. yBik 3, 65d quotes a baraita' in the name of R. Yose, very possibly the second-century tanna from Sepphoris, who explains that the birds were not to be placed upon the fruits lest they soil them. The daily tamid offering is also depicted and includes not only the biblically required lamb, oil, and flour but also the two silver trumpets visitors.

Sifre Zuta' to Nms 10:10 understands "Your fixed festivals" (mo'adekhem) to be an allusion to the daily offerings at which "you shall sound trumpets (4atsots4- rot)." The midrash suggests that the reason the verse specifies that hatsots- rot were to be used for the soundings is to prohibit the use of rams' horns (shofarot) for this purpose. In its detailed account of the tamid service, the Mishnah (Tamid 7:3) expressly indicates how twvo silver trumpets, evi- dently derived from the plural form of the word in Nm 1 0:1I0, were sounded during the tamid offerings. Again the view of the rabbis appears to be reflected in the mosaic.87 87. For a discussion of these rabbinic parallels, see Z.

Weiss may be correct that the synagogue floor from Sepphoris demonstrates "the centrality of talmudic literature" for the artist or his sources. 8 The chronology of the literature and the floor would certainly support this line of reasoning. The issue to be explored here, however, is this: how would a rabbi or someone who followed the sages have related to a floor that contained both rabbinic and pagan themes? Because the Sepphoris floor juxtaposes the two themes in a way that no other ancient synagogue floor does, this question is of particular interest. Several elements of the zodiac in this mosaic suggest a concerted at- Art and Society in Late Antiquity, Journal of Roman Archaeology, 4upplneentary series, 40 (2000), 24-25. 88. Weiss, "Sepphoris Synagogue," 28.</page><page sequence="27">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 53 tempt to make pagan themes intelligible to the Jew. The signs of the zodiac and the months are clearly identified in Hebrew. The months are aligned properly with the seasons (tekufot) that are personified as females and represented by appropriate vegetation in the four corners of the square that frames the zodiac circle. The seasons are also named in both Hebrew and Greek.89 There should be little doubt that M. Avi-Yonah's calendrical understanding of the zodiac in synagogue art is correct.90 The sun at the center of the zodiac indeed generates the fertility of the agricul- tural calendar, but what is remarkable is that unlike other representations of the zodiac, this one does not depict Helios. Instead, the sun rises from a horse-drawn chariot, itself emerging from what appears to be water, with the moon and the stars in the background. (See Figure 2.) In a well-documented and insightful article, H. Mack draws parallels between this depiction in the Sepphoris mosaic and a couple of post- talmudic midra4him pertaining to Ps 19:6.91 Be-Midbar Rabbah 12:4 reads:92 "[He [King Solomon] made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon. He made its posts of silver . . ., its chariot [merkavo] of purple wool" (Song 3:9-10). This is the sun (shenews) which is situated above and rides in its chariot and illuminates the world. As it says [Ps 19:6], "[He placed in them a tent for the sun] who is like a groom coming forth from the chamber, etc." And because of the power of the sun, the rains fall, and from the power of the sun, the earth yields fruit. 89. This is in contrast to Bet Alfa, Naaran, and Hammat Tiberias, where the seasons only appear in Hebrew. The mosaic at Huseifa depicts the seasons but does not name them. The months and seasons are misaligned in the floors at Bet Alfa, Naaran and Huseifa. They do, however, properly correspond in the mosaic at Hammat Tiberias. 90. M.

This excerpt understands the "chariot of purple wool" in Song 3:10 to be an allusion to the sun, which, in Ps 19:6, emerges from its chamber and, in the following verse, travels from one end of heaven to another. The midrash also attributes fertility to the "power" of the sun. Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 6 further documents this journey of the sun:93 As it says, "It goes towards the South and turns towards the North" (Eccl 1:6). It [the sun] goes towards the South at the tekufah of Tishrei and at the tekufah of Tevet, and it turns towards the North at the tekufah of Nisan and at the tekufah of Tammuz. It stays on its course for six months in the southern corner and for six months in the northern corner ... The sun has three letters of the name [of God] on its heart and the angels lead it. Those who lead in the daytime do not lead it at night; those who lead it at night do night lead it in the daytime. And the sun (4ammah) rides in its chariot and rises crowned like a groom and "like a hero, eager to run his course." As it says (Ps 19:6), "who is like a groom coming forth from the chamber, like a hero, eager to run his course. This excerpt unequivocally demonstrates the connection of the course of the sun with the calendar. It further understands Ps 19:6 as an allusion to the daily renewal of the sun. Moreover, by impressing the name of God upon the "heart" of the sun and insisting that angels guide the chariot, the midrash emphasizes that, ultimately, it is God who mobilizes the sun and its chariot to make their daily and seasonal journeys.94 93.

Mack argues that the late midrashim reflect a much earlier tradition that purposely resisted depicting the sun as a deity.96 Those responsible for the floor at Sepphoris similarly avoided depictions of the sun as the god Helios or Sol Invictus, the invincible ruler of Rome. Mack goes so far as to suggest that the leaders of the Jewish settlement at fifth-century Sep- phoris prevailed upon the artists to avoid a depiction similar to that al- ready found at Hammat Tiberias.97 Be that as it may, Mack's main point, that there is a correlation between the mosaic at Sepphoris and rabbinic observations about the sun, appears to be correct. Scholars who have studied the zodiac panel have either seen it as part of a programmatic statement made by the entire mosaic floor or have attempted to understand it in light of prevailing notions of sun worship in the Roman Empire.98 Mack's contribution is to connect this part of the floor with rabbinic tradition, albeit late. A further examination of biblical and rabbinic attitudes toward solar worship in ancient Israel, however, would not only reinforce Mack's argument but would also shed light on the diverse perceptions of the sun within Jewish society in Late Antiq- source of their powers and vitality. See, for example, Pesikta de-Rav Kabana 12:12. Luria also notes Ex 23:20-21, where God sends an angel before the Israelites to lead them and warns them to obey him because "My Name is in him." Here the angel who bears God's name is clearly doing his bidding. There is no reason, therefore, to read into the placement of God's name upon the heart of the sun an actual identification of the sun and the deity. Interesting, too, in this regard is Slavonic Enoch 14:2, where angels return the sun's crown to God when the sun sets and retrieve the crown for the sun before sunrise. 95. See, for example, A. Ovadiah, "'Omanut ha-Pesifus be-Vatte ha-Kenesset 'Atikim be-'Erets Yisra'el," Batte Kenesset Atikim, ed. A. Oppenheimer, A. Kasher, U. Rappaport (Jerusalem, 1987), 190. G.

Cf. the assessment of these views in Mack, "Yihudo shel Galgal Ha-Mazalot," 43-45. 96. Mack, "Yihudo shel Galgal Ha-Mazalot," 48. To be sure, Pirket de-Rabbi Eliezer 6 does continue with a depiction of the sun's "face" (panim) and rays that "look" (mabitot) downward towards the earth in summer and away from the earth in winter. This, however, is the closest the passage comes to personification of the sun, and, in any event, the imagery hardly conjures up a god. 97. Mack, "Yihudo shel Galgal Ha-Mazalot," 55-56. 98.

This, in turn, would further clarify the ability (or inability) of the rabbis to relate to the depictions of the celestial sphere in the "archaeolog- ical synagogues. Sun-worship in the Roman Empire has been well documented.99 Already in the last years of the Republic and under Augustus, Apollo was exploited for political purposes. Under the Severans (193-235 C.E.), devotion to the sun became dominant at Rome. The sun god would soon be depicted with a beard similar to that of Septimius, who assumed the title t/lvwctus ("the invincible"), which was ordinarily preserved for the sun. Elagabalus, who was a priest of the sun god at Emesa, championed the deity and brought the black betyl stone, which was believed to contain its power, to Rome. There he placed the god in a chariot to transport it beyond Rome. It would remain for Aurelian to raise the sun god to predominance at Rome and for Constantine to fuse Sol Invictus with "Christ the Victorious."'100 While one need not look much deeper than earlier Roman religion for the roots of these developments, Eastern influences were largely responsi- ble for the burgeoning preoccupation with Sol Invictus in the Empire. Indeed, Tacitus notes how soldiers saluted the sun just as was the custom in Syria.'0' The rising sun and light played a major role in the myth of Mithras, which Roman soldiers helped spread. Elagabalus's name was very possibly derived from the fusion of the Greek sun god and a Syrian deity (Heliogabalus). Finally, Aurelian found his way to both Emesa and Palmyra. He not only restored the sun cult in Palmyra but also proceeded to bring his rule over East and West under the unifying, divine authority of the sun god.102 99. See, G. H. Halsberghe, The Cult of Sol Inv'ctts (Leiden, 1972), and J. Fer- guson, The Religions of the Romnan Empire (Ithaca, N.Y., 1970), 44-56. Cf. the re- view of Halsberghe by J. R.

Smith long ago collected the material evidence for sun worship among pagans in Roman Palestine and Transjordan. He further traced the origin of the phenomenon to the biblical period and identified evidence for sun worship among the "children of light" at Oumran, who, with their solar calendar, appear to have shared the view of Enoch and Jubilees that the year was ruled by the sun rather than the moon.103 More recently, L. Roussin, taking her cue from Smith's effort, reviewed the evidence for the persistence of sun worship into the centuries leading up to the period of the fifth-century Sepphoris synagogue.104 Both Smith and Roussin note the rabbis' antipathy for such worship and point to the ca. fourth century C.E. magical text, Sefer Ha-Raziln, for evidence that it nonetheless persisted.105 Smith believed that the Helios of the synagogue mosaics was seen as an angel by some Jews and concludes that the liter- ary sources reveal "what Jews less meticulous than the rabbis were doing. "106 Roussin considers the mosaic from Sepphoris and proposes a programmatic reading wherein the representation of the sun is an "ab- stract depiction of the sun god Helios." Roussin again follows Smith's lead and suggests that some worshippers actually prayed to a minor deity, even at Sepphoris.107 The views of Smith and Roussin elevate the significance of the pagan aspects of the zodiacs and the testimony of Sefer Ha-Raztinz, in which He- lios becomes a lesser deity, over the views of the rabbis.108 The Sepphoris zodiac, however, appears alongside undeniably rabbinic themes and is unusual precisely because it does not personify Helios. At least in this synagogue, there is no reason to automatically assume that a worshipper would have invoked a "minor deity." Nor, however, should we necessarily conclude that rabbis and their followers would have avoided worshipping in the synagogues at Bet Alpha or Hammat Tiberias, simply because of their demonstrative depic- Emesa and Palmyra, see Ferguson, 54 and Halsberghe, 155-158, who, neverthe- less, argues that Aurelian promoted a uniquely Roman form of the cult of Deu4 Sol Invictas. 103.

What needs to be appreciated is that the earliest of the zodiac floors, that of Hammat Tiberias, was created at the end of a pro- tracted, millennium long gestation of and (as is evident from biblical and talmudic sources) struggle with devotion to the sun. Solar worship was considered a serious and ongoing challenge to an imageless monotheism. Indeed, by the time of Josiah and soon after in the days of Ezekiel, sun worship, possibly in the form of "solar Yahwism," appears to have en- croached upon the central cult.109 This is evident from the biblical record and perhaps from some suggestive archaeological evidence. A tenth-cen- tury cultic stand from Taanach includes a depiction of a quadruped, most likely a horse, below a radiant sun, and seventh-century terracotta figu- rines found in Jerusalem have been identified by some as horses with sun discs attached to their heads.1"0 Both bring to mind the horses dedicated to the sun that Josiah removed from the entrance to the Temple (2 Kgs 109. A number of scholars have argued for a "solar Yahwism," i.e., the repre- sentation of Yahweh in solar terminology. Mark S. Smith, "The Near Eastern Background of Solar Language for Yahweh," JBL 109.1 (1990): 29-39, argues that this phenomenon had its origins in both Canaanite and Near Eastern usage of divine language and was especially prevalent in Judah during the monarchy, when solar terminology was also applied to the king in order to enhance his status. Nevertheless, Smith 23, 39, admits, that 2 Kgs 23 and Ez 8 (on both, see below) regard devotion to the sun as idolatrous. Cf. Smith's review, JBL 106.3 (1987): 513-515, of H. P. Stahli, Solare Elenzente cn JahweglauLbelz des alten Teita- Inents (OBO 66; Freiburg, 1985). Taylor, Yahwveh and the Sutn: Biblical and A'chaeo- logical Evidence for Sutn Worship in Anlcient Israel, JSOT Scpplement Series 111 (Sheffield, 1993), 255-258, goes much further in arguing for an indigenous ex- pression of solar Yahwism that was only opposed by Deuteronomist theology. The evidence for this acceptable solar Yahwism has to be read into the biblical texts and seems to me to be forced. See especially the response of S. A. Wiggins, "Yahweh: The God of Sun?" JSOT 71 (1996): 89-106. The view taken below is that Ps 19 and other biblical passages point to a sustained, internal polemic with either sun worship or the putative solar Yahwism. Ps 19 may only have come to represent this polemic once it attained its final form, but this understanding is supported, as will be shown, both by other biblical evidence as well as by later, rabbinic allusions to the Psalm. 110.

As we shall see, however, the author of Ps 19, as well as the rabbis, responded to solar deification by finding a place for the sun in their own cosmology that did not compromise their belief in an imageless and single God. Indeed, the import of the late nidrashbtin presented above can be more readily under- stood, and a stronger case made for their use in historical reconstruction of the period leading up to the Sepphoris synagogue mosaic, once the extent of the polemic articulated in the biblical and talmudic sources is realized. It is important to emphasize that this polemic must be appreciated in diachronic terms. The sages responded with midrashic exegesis of biblical passages precisely because they were picking up where the biblical writ- ers had left off. For the rabbis, perceptions of Helios and Sol Invictus in the Roman Empire were merely new expressions of an old phenomenon. Thus when mSuk 5:4 describes the water drawing ceremony at the Tem- ple on the festival of Sukkot, it relates how the procession proceeded through the eastern gate where the people would turn their faces toward the west. The Mishnah explains that this was done because "our fore- fathers who were in this place would turn thetir backs touards the Temple of the Lord and their faces towards the eadt, and they would prostrate terenselves eadtward towards the sun. But our eyes are towards the Lord."'13 The ances- tral practice alluded to by the tannaim is described in almost precisely the language (italicized here) of Ez 8:16, where it is clearly perceived as were understood as the sun and some were not, but Taylor's reservations must be considered. 111.

Biblical writers, however, bequeathed to the rabbis not only an awareness of the threat of sun worship but also an interpretive mechanism for assimi- lating the sun to their own theology. At the heart of the rabbinic under- standing is Ps 19, which is the only biblical passage to resort to "mythological personification" to depict a celestial body."51 Verse 6 is singled out in Be-Midbar Rabbah to Nm 12:4 and Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer 6, but -these midrashic excerpts make the most sense when the entire Ps is taken into account. Ps 19 immediately establishes (v.1), "The heavens declare the glory of God; His handiwork, the sky proclaims." N. Sarna has observed that the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies were thought to be situated in the "sky" (raqi'a) whereas God was believed to be in or beyond the heavens. The psalmist, therefore, carefully distinguishes between the abode of God and the sky and has the visible celestial spheres, which would in- clude the sun, acknowledge /naieha yadav, God's "handiwork."" 16 The rabbis also preserved the notion of multiple heavens, the highest of which belonged to God, with the sun located below in an altogether different hl"amayun.17 Ps 19:5 has God situate a "tent" for the sun in the sky. Two ca. fifth- century midrashic sources explicitly allude to this verse, among others, when explaining the configuration of the heavens. Pesikta' de-Rav Kabanza (Supplement 2, sec. 1) and Bereshit Rabbab, 6:17 resort to Gn 1:17 (bt-reqt'a ba-hbaInmayin) to demonstrate that the sun was placed in the "firmament of the heaven." The late third-early fourth century ainora of Caesarea, R. Abbahu, is quoted to the effect that Neh 9:6 proves that God placed His host in the altogether different "heaven of heavens" (Aheine hwa-shbam- 114. Some versions follow the Masoretic text exactly and have MriMMOn for mmlrnn . Cf. Albeck ad loc. Wiggins, "Yahweh: The God of Sun?" 103, properly argues that in Ez 8:16 the prophet is complaining that the twenty-five men who turn away from the Temple and bow toward the sun are in fact distinguishing between the God of the Temple and the sun. They do not equate the two as some have thought. Taylor's contention, that this is yet another instance of "solar Yahwism," must be rejected, especially since it largely depends on his speculative understanding of the verses that follow (17-18). See Taylor, Yahbveb and the Sul, 147-158. 115. See N. M. Sarna, "Psalm XIX and the Near Eastern Sun-God Litera- ture," 365. 116. Cf. a similar perspective at Ps 148:1-6 and see Sarna, Songs of the Heart, 77-78. 1 17. See especially the comments attributed to the second-century Palestinian tanina, R. Judah, who cites Dt 10: 14, and to the third-century Tiberian sage, Resh Laqish, at bHag 12b.</page><page sequence="35">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 61 mayim). The sun was kept in the "firmament of the heaven," sufficiently away from humans, lest it burn them. Pesikta' de-Rav Kahana further quotes Ps 19:5 and explains that the sun required both a sheath (the "tent" in v. 5) and a great journey between the firmaments, five hundred years in duration, in order to lessen the intensity of its heat and protect humans."8 The midrash continues that in the time to come, God will remove the sheath so that the sun will destroy the wicked as it follows its course from one end of heaven to the other. Beresbit Rabbab 6:17, more pointedly, first alludes to Ps 19:7, "nothing escapes Hifits sun/heat (kammato)" and explains that on the first of Tam- muz there is no shade and the heat of the sun is inescapable. At this point we are informed that the sun has a protective sheath and there is a body of water that ordinarily tempers its heat when it goes forth. Although we already have been informed that on the first of Tammuz the heat is unbearable, we now learn that the situation would actually be much worse were it not for the protective tent/sheath and water. Thus Beresbit Rabbah builds to a crescendo by emphasizing the fierceness of the sun's heat in this world and climaxes with the assertion that, in the future, God will remove the protective sheath from galgal ha-bammah ("the sphere of the sun") to destroy the wicked. The day upon which this occurs, say the third-century sages R. Yannai and R. Simeon ben Laqish, in both Pesikta' de-Rav Kahana and Bereshbit Rabbah, is "Gehinnom."'19 Evidently, Beresbit Rabbah understands Ps 19 to mean that God could use hfi sun (hammato) in protective and punitive ways. These midrahbim appear to follow the lead of Ps 19: 7, where the psalm- ist switches from the earlier use of shemesh (v. 5) to bammah and appends the third-person masculine pronominal suffix (4'ammato). Perhaps the psalmist wishes to make a point by resorting to Ibammab rather than shem- esdh, which was too reminiscent of the Canaanite and Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash.'20 On the other hand, bammah may simply have been a common form in Israelite (northern) Hebrew, in which v. 2-7 appear to 118. Cf. yBer 9, 13a. 119. For this temporal understanding of "Gehinnom," cf. the parallel in Mid- ra,jb Tebldlim 19:13. 120. So Sarna, Songs of the Heart, 81-82, argues, with reference to the Mesopo- tamian Shamash. Evidence for the worship of the sun in Canaan may be weaker than for Egypt and Mesopotamia, but it is, nonetheless, significant. Shamash was worshipped at Ugarit as Shapash. Moreover, the towns of Bet-Shemesh (e.g., Jos 15:10), En-Shemesh (Jos 15:7; 18:17), and Ir-Shemesh (Jos 19:41) undoubt- edly were so-named in remembrance of sanctuaries devoted to a sun god. See E. Lipinski, "Shemesh," K. van der Toorn, B. Becking, and P. W. van der Horst, eds., Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible (Leiden, 1999), 764-765.</page><page sequence="36">62 JQR 94:1 (2004) be written.12' Nevertheless, the preference for kaniniab in v. 7 is signifi- cant, since it enables the psalmist to take advantage of the dual meaning "heat/sun," and allows for the placement of both the sun and its qualities in the hands of God. The psalmist already asserts God's control over the sun and all the heavenly bodies in vv. 2-6, but the usage of I?amniato in 19:7 serves to further emphasize the point. The rabbis, who clearly pre- ferred the use of the term 4anunab to shemeneb in their writings, more ex- plicitly exploit the nuances of the term. 122 Thus Beresbit Rabbab 6:17 takes advantage of the dual meaning of kainmato as "HMi sun" and "its heat." The midrash seemingly understands baamniato as "its heat" when it reports that the first of Tammuz is a steamy day. However, in quickly asserting that God uses the sun to judge the wicked, the editor (at the very least) displays an appreciation of the theological point of making the sun HiJ.123 In Beresbit Rabbalb, as well as in Ps 19, the sun does God's bidding. 121. Following G. Rendsburg, apud S. Noegel, "Dialect and Politics in Isaiah 24-27,"AAu/l Orientalii 12 (1994): 183 n. 45. Interestingly, Smith, "The Near East- ern Background of Solar Language for Yahweh," 39, maintains that the depiction of Yahweh in solar terms is not attested in the northern kingdom and is "a special expression of Judaen royal theology." This would further suggest that bani,nab and shelnesb were taken as synonyms in the North and were not part of an overall polemic, as Sarna would have it. This does not, however, preclude the likelihood that the psalmist wished to take advantage of the manifold characteristics of the sun which are better conveyed by hanunab. See next note. At the same time, the redacted Ps 19 may still have had a polemical function, despite the original intention. 122. A search of the Bar Ilan Responsa database for the usage of both terms reveals that buanimab is overwhelmingly preferred in both taninaitic and alnoraic literature. Cf. J. Maier, "Die Sonne im religi6sen Denken des antiken Juden- tums" ANRW II. 19.1 (1979): 360-361, who maintains that by the second century C.E. the use of barmnnia surpassed that of sbeinesb. Sarna, "Psalm XIX and the Near Eastern Sun-god Literature," 367-368, points out the many meanings of balnlnahl, including "heat," "light," "sight" and "sun" and suggests that the psalm- ist had in mind "the all-pervasive effects of the sun's presence." Taylor, Yab(Veb and the Sun, 224-225 argues that banimab should be understood as elsewhere in the Tanakb as "sun." Accordingly, there is "continuity" with v. 2, since the baln- czab is an expression of the glory of God. Although the assertion that 4a,nnziah is simply a synonym for shemesh elsewhere in the Tanakb is important, it matters little, for our purposes, since the psalmist could still have had the various nuances alluded to here in mind, and rabbinic literature clearly understood it accordingly. 123. M. Dahood, Plabms I, 1-50 (New York, 1965, 1966), prefers vocalizing Inebemnato and understands the term as "from its [the sun's] pavilion." The word would then form an inc/iusi with "tent" in v. 5. Dahood's suggestion is perhaps even more convincing because of the use of mebuppato, which he translates as "from its bower," (JPS: "from its pavilion") in 19:6. Nevertheless, it is clear that the rabbis understood the term as referring to the sun and its heat, in accordance with the rendering of the Masoretic text. Perhaps nz/l?/n/nto is an intentional dou-</page><page sequence="37">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 63 Nor were other polemical understandings of Ps 19 lost upon the rabbis. Sarna points out that the Mesopotamian sun god, Shamash, is also de- scribed as a "warrior," much as the sun is called gibbor in v. 6.124 An extraordinary, but late, midrash, Shemot Ra//ah, alludes to the sun as Helios and resorts to this verse as proof that the sun/Helios was charac- terized as a warrior.125 Shemnot Rabbab 15 goes on to compare the might of the sun to that of the Greek kingdom (malkbut yavan) before whom all were fearful. Similarly, the midrash asserts, all fled before the Greek kingdom until Mattathias and his sons succeeded in defeating it. The Greek kingdom/Helios succumbed precisely because Mattathias and his sons had faith in God. There indeed was a greater gibbor than the sun! Interestingly, Shemot Rabbalg introduces this thought with the assertion, similar to that in Beres/1it Rabbah, that during the summer circuit (tekufat Tammuz) of the sun, all flee its heat. Once again Ps 19:7, "nothing escapes Hm "sun/heat," is produced as proof. Apparently, the point of "hammato" was not missed by the editor of Shemot Rabbab, who apparently was aware of the much earlier midrash on Ps 19:5 found in Beresbit Rabab.h126 The "circuit" of the sun is part of the polemic in Ps 19 and, again, the rabbis do not miss the point. Verse 7 has the sun arise at one end of heaven and extend its circuit (tekufato) to the other extremity. Not sur- prisingly, the Mesopotamian Shamash bore the epithet "He who tra- verses the way of heaven and earth."'127 Like the psalmist, the rabbis were ble entendre, further driving home the point that "nothing escapes" the sun which God placed in its "pavilion." Dahood, however, takes niitar to be from the root d wr, "to turn aside" and renders the entire phrase as "Never turning aside from its pavilion," which seems forced. 124. Sarna, "Psalm XIX and the Near Eastern Sun-God Literature," 366, and idem, Songs of tlhe Heart, 81. 125. Although there are differing views on the date of Sleniot Rabbab, the first part of the work (chapters 1-14) is generally dated to no later than the tenth century. The remaining chapters (15-52) may be earlier. Nahmanides (1194- 1270) was familiar with the entire work. Sbemot Rabbab is clearly from Erets Israel, as can be seen by its use of Galilean Aramaic and Greek and Latin terms. It also does not appear to be familiar with the Babylonian Talmud. See Strack and Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midlrasb, 336-337. 126. Admittedly, in both Beresbit Rabbab and Sbeniot Rabbab, lnamnzato could be taken to mean "its (the sun's) heat" and the introductory thought pertaining to tekufat Tamnmuz would still make sense. The point made here, however, is that the material that follows in both sources indicates that the rabbis understood the sun to be in God's control, very much making it "Hii sun." It is likely, therefore, that this is the point the rabbis wished to convey throughout. 127. Sarna, "Psalm XIX and the Near Eastern Sun-God Literature," 367, and ideln, Songs of the Heart, 81.

Thus tfler 6:6 insists:'28 One who sees the sun, the moon, the stars, and the constellations says, "Blessed is the one who brings about creation." The suggested belrakhah affirms that God is responsible for the creation of the universe. This may very well have been prompted by assertions to the contrary, especially that the sun had some powers of its own, as a gloss attributed to a second-century [anna implies:129 Rabbi Judah says, "One who recites a blessing over the sun-It is considered 'another way' (derekh aker et)."

While there has been considerable discussion in rabbinic sources of the intention of tektufab here, there can be no doubt that its use is premised on Ps 19:7, where it is applied to the daily "circuit" of the sun.'32 In talmudic sources, the term tekufab takes on the meaning of the sun's "turning," that is, the winter and summer solstices and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, at which point new seasons begin.133 TekuJfah would eventually be used in rabbinic literature as well as in synagogue mosaics (where the term appears at the four corners, or "turnings," of the zodiac wheel!) to designate each of the seasons.134 R. Huna, appar- ently one of the late third-century figures by that name,135 understands the tekitfab intended here as the rainy season and, therefore, limits the saying of the beraklbab to appearances of the sun after three overcast days during that period. The Bavli goes even further in making this a blessing that is only recited every twenty-eight years upon the return of the sun to its original alignment at creation.'36 Nevertheless, the thrust of our passage is clear: God is responsible for the tekufabI.

The sun does not, indeed cannot, refuse to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Instead, it cheerfully fulfills God's will! Here again, the rabbis are only amplifying the biblical polemic with pagan religion.140 Although it does not explicitly allude to Ps 19, exegetical comments assigned in Vayiqra'Rabbtah 31:9 to two ainoralin of Erets Israel, R. Levi (third century) and R. Yusta bar Shunam (fourth century) drive home a similar point, further proving that the rabbis of the talmudic period augmented the already familiar biblical polemic with pagan religion:'41 138. JPS has "eager to run," but it is clear that the rabbis understood yajsi to have the sense of rejoicing. 139. See ANET 368 line 9, and the discussion in Sarna, Sonlgs of thge Heart, 86. 140. Cf. Ps 104, where the psalmist, according to Taylor, Yahwveb alid tlhe Suuli, 229-230, "adopted and adapted an Egyptian hymnic tradition ... that included a solar understanding of the deity." Taylor contends that Atenism would have been long forgotten by the time the Psalm was written, so a polemic with Egyp- tian Atenism is not likely. He suggests instead that the psalm's "Atenistic" charac- ter allows for the possibility of a polemic w'ithtn ancient Israel over "a theologically acceptable form of solar Yahwism." See, however, the scholars cited by Wiggins, "Yahweh: The God of Sun?" 104, to refute this view and to argue that the use of solar language in this Psalm to refer to God does not mean the sun and Yahweh are to be identified. For our purposes, familiarity with Egyptian motifs in this Psalm could point to a sharper polemical response to Ra, the bringer of joy, or to indigenous associations of the sun and joy. 141. Actually, the comment assigned to R. Levi follows upon an exegesis of Ps 19: 6 attributed to another third-century sage, R. Hoshaya, son of R. Simai of Caesarea. It is also interesting to note that the comment of R. Levi also appears in the considerably later Midr-adls Telilliim to Ps 19. These enhancements of the biblical polemic obviously circulated long before they were included in MidraJh Telhilliniz.</page><page sequence="41">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 67 R.

'Mortals burn incense to us and prostrate themselves before us."' R. Yusta' bar Shunam said, "What does the Holy (One) then do to them? He sits in judgment on them and they go out and illuminate the world against their will. This is as is written [Zep 3:5], 'He issues judgment every morning, As un- failing as the light.' "142 Following the lead of medieval biblical exegetes, modern scholars have understood Ps 19 to be composed of distinct but interrelated sections. Verses 1-7 comprise a hymn to God that, as we have seen, has the heav- ens proclaim the glory of God and singles out the sun for its joy in fulfill- ing the divine purpose. Dahood is undoubtedly correct in describing this section of Ps 19 as "an adaptation to Yahwistic purposes of an ancient Canaanite hymn to the sun."'143 The remaining verses, 8-15, comprise a seemingly discrete hymn to the Torah. However, the allusions to the Torah are frequently couched in terms that are ordinarily used to describe the sun. The point of the psalmist could not be made more evident: it is the Torah of God that "revives the spirit (v. 8)," "rejoices the heart (v. 9)," and "makes the eyes light up (v. 9)," not the sun god as was believed in Mesopotamia and Egypt. 144 Moreover, the Torah is pure and just, qual- ities that were associated with the Mesopotamian Shamash and embodied by the Egyptian concept of na 'at, or "order," which was personified as the goddess Ma'at, daughter of Ra. Sarna notes the allusion to the Torah as "light" in Prov 6:23 and the fact that the entire second half of the Psalm is suffused with terminology usually reserved for solar worship.145 The psalm's overall point is that the cosmos and the Torah provide knowl- edge of God.146 142.

Sarna, Songs of the Heart, 75-76, 92.</page><page sequence="42">68 JQR 94:1 (2004) At the same time, the use of the term tentininah in v. 8 to refer to the Torah/teaching of God as "perfect," or "unblemished," suggests that the Torah, and not any of the would-be celestial gods of the first section of the psalm, serves as the "unerring ethical guide" to life.'47 Perhaps more should be made of the use of the root t/n/iln in Ps 19. The same root is resorted to in v. 14, where the psalmist pleads to be kept away from the arrogant and asserts, "then shall I be blameless ('eitain) and clear of grave offense." The biblical talninln is used, of course, with reference to both Noah and Abraham and refers to their singular devotion to the one God. Thus Noah is described as "blameless" and as one who "walked with God." Abraham is similarly urged to "walk before Me and be blameless" (Gn 17:1). Such expressions are reminiscent of similar terms used in As- syrian documents to profess perfect loyalty, as M. Weinfeld has demon- strated.'48 The use of talinliz within the Torah itself, however, already points in this direction. Dt 18, following on the heels of Dt 17: 3, with its admonition against turning to other gods and worshipping the sun and the moon, warns the Israelites about falling for the auguries, soothsayers, diviners, and other forms of sorcery of the nations upon entering the land-obvious allusions to practices that would lead them astray after other gods. Instead the Israelites are urged to be "blameless with the Lord your God" (Dt 18:13).149 Ps 19 seems to be saying that those who follow the perfect Torah will be blameless before God precisely because of the devotion thereby displayed toward Him. This devotion is an un- equivocal rejection of the pagan notions that underlie the polemic in the first half of Ps 19.150 Indeed, the "grave offense" (pes4ha' ra) that is to be avoided can be none other than idolatry, as Dahood has pointed out.'5' 147. I borrow Sarna's (84) characterization of the Torah here. 148. M. Weinfeld, "The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East," JAOS 90.2 (1970): 185-186. This understanding of Abraham as "blameless" is made more evident in Jubilees 21:2. 149. Cf. the comments of Ramban (Nahmanides) on Gn 17:1. Ramban takes other commentators to task for not perceiving the precise connotation of talinim with reference to Abraham. Tainlinz is used in the Dead Sea Scrolls to refer to the sect's devotion to God through observance of the Torah. See J. Licht, Megillat Ha-Seraklhin'z Mi-Megillot Midbar Yelhutdab (Jerusalem, 1965), 60, 190. My thanks to Professor Lawrence H. Schiffman for calling this to mny attention. 150. The eighteenth-century commentator R. David Altschuler, Metsudat David to Ps 19:8, observes that the verse implies that Torah is more perfect (so he understands "temimah") and more useful than the sun. After all, the Torah "re- vives the spirit" whereas the sun's heat can be destructive. Furthermore, the Torah "makes the eyes light up," but the sun blinds them. 151. It is synonymous with "the great sin" ((gata'alh Ia-gedolal) found at Gn 20:9 and elsewhere. See Dahood, Psalms I, 1-50, 125, where he calls attention to the similar expression, hittat Iabtt ("the great sin"), which appears in Akkadian</page><page sequence="43">"EPIGRAPHICAL" RABBIS, HELIOS, AND PSALM 19, MILLER 69 The rabbis too note these points. Earlier we saw how both Pesikta'd e- Rav Kahana and Bereshit Rabbah viewed the removal of the sheath/tent that protects the sun as a mechanism for punishing the wicked. Clearly there is an appreciation for the role the sun plays, albeit on behalf of God, in judging humankind. Again, when we turn to later midrashic collections, particularly Midrash Tehillint 19:13,152 we find the same assertion that the sun will wreak havoc on the wicked coupled with the assertion that the one who will be concealed (nistar, cf. v. 7) from His san/heat will be who- ever is preoccupied with Torah. Midrasb Tehi/lim 19:14 goes so far as to read into v. 8-10 allusions to the six orders of the Mishnah, thereby con- veying the point that the oral Torah is also included in the Torah/teaching that sustains humankind! Furthermore, MIdrasb Tebilliln 19:14 explains that the Teaching (Torah) is perfect (ternitnab) when it spews forth from the mouth of the righteous person who is tamim. The midrash adds that "the decrees of the Lord are enduring (ne 'en2nab) when they come from the mouth of one who is conscientious (ne'eman) in their observance."'153 Uncompromising devotion to God through the precepts of His Torah is certainly understood by the rabbis to be what "revives the spirit" in v. 8 and is very much the overall point of Ps 19.154 Just as Noah and Abraham were "blameless" because of their willingness to follow God, the tamtim of rabbinic tradition were those who asserted their loyalty to God by keep- ing the precepts of His perfect Torah.'55 Ps 19's influence on the rabbis is self-evident. texts from Ras Shamra and refers to adultery. Dahood notes the close association of adultery with idolatry in Israelite thought. 152. This work is particularly difficult to date, with a wide spread of suggested possibilities. That part which covers Ps 1-118 has material going back to the talmudic period, but Strack and G. Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud anld Midrash, 351, imagine "an extended period of development," which some contend would continue until the end of the geonic period. That the midrash emanates from Erez Israel is not doubted. 153. Ed. Buber: sN"Il 77V11r ninxi W?n bnnwX owr sn-w pni: bw ?n nsNir m?nw ;nn nnwr w?n bnrx 1883 bEOn nNrt1 154. See above, n. 150. 155. The rabbis applied this sense to tamim elsewhere. See especially Efther Rabbah 1:18, where the people of Media are said to have acknowledged (nzo- dayya) the Holy One Blessed be He, hence the name of their country (niadat). R. Hiyya bar Abba agrees, adding that they were indeed "blameless" (temtmtm) and that the only thing the Holy One Blessed be He had against them was that they inherited idolatry from their ancestors. Also, see Shenmot Rabbah 15:16, where the Jews in Egypt, Babylon and Media are all tamim because they remained loyal to their God.</page><page sequence="44">70 JQR 94:1 (2004) PROGRAMMATIC UNDERSTANDINGS AND THE RABBIS Many who have written about the synagogue zodiac mosaics and, most recently, about the Sepphoris floor have assumed that they represent an integrated whole with a thematic connection rather than disparate frames that are, at best, loosely connected. While Avi-Yonah and R. Hachlili contended that the zodiacs should be primarily understood as liturgical calendars,156 others have sought deeper meanings that are integrated with the larger mosaic context in which the zodiac is depicted. The most prom- inent and perhaps influential proponent of a comprehensive, symbolic meaning was E. R. Goodenough, who proposed that Helios and the char- iot represent "the divine Charioteer of hellenized Judaism, God him- self."''57 For Goodenough, the floors projected God as the ruler of the cosmos and offered the worshipper, much as astral mysticism did for pa- gans, the hope of immortality.'58 Others have also pursued symbolism as the key to understanding the message of the zodiac mosaics but do not see the necessity of postulating a Jewish mystery religion to explain them. I. Sonne, for example, pro- posed that the rabbinic notion of three "crowns," that is, of Torah, Priest- hood, and Kingdom, is expressed in the paintings from the Dura Synagogue as well as in the mosaic in the Synagogue at Bet Alpha.'59 Sonne rightly emphasized the astrological significance of the signs of the zodiac but then suggested a rather inventive interpretation according to which Israel, represented by Cancer/Moon at the top of the Bet Alpha zodiac, was triumphant over Helios, or Rome.'60 The Sepphoris floor, with themes that are consistent with views of the rabbis and its omission of the personification of Helios, prompted a reevaluation of the many views put forth earlier. Weiss and E. Netzer proposed an elaborate reading of the mosaic in which scenes depicting the visit of angels to Sarah and the Binding of Isaac are supposed to suggest to the viewer "the promise" made by God to Israel. According to Weiss and Netzer, the sun and chariot at the center of the zodiac panel 156. See above, n. 90. 157. See E. R.

Taken together with the symbols of the Tabernacle/Temple in the frames above the mosaic, which represent the future, the whole transports the worship- per from the promise made to Abraham to the future redemption of the Jews, when the Temple will be restored.'6' Goodenough also viewed the God depicted by the other zodiac mosaics as the cosmocrator, but went too far in divorcing the mosaics from rabbinic Judaism.162 Weiss and Netzer, on the other hand, claim that the eschatological interpretation they propose reflects the "religious aspirations of the Jews of the Land of Israel."'"63 Most have followed Weiss and Netzer's lead in suggesting program- matic understandings of the Sepphoris zodiac and floor.164 S. Schwartz suggests that the floor transports the viewer from an idealized world, "through the heavens, to the Temple cult and back to the reality of the synagogue."''65 Similarly, Roussin sees the mosaic as thematically con- necting the "earthly sphere" with the Temple and the seventh firmament of Sefer Ha-Razim.'66 Others have understood the Sepphoris mosaic as a response to either paganism or Christianity. B. Kiihnel sees two phases in the adaptation of the zodiac and of Helios as a mode of representing the sun in Jewish art. Accordingly, Jews quickly moved away from the more realistic depiction at Hammat Tiberias (Figure 1) to the more ab- stract personification at Bet Alpha and the Helios-less representation at Sepphoris. According to Kuihnel, the Sepphoris mosaic contains a "well thought out program" and polemic that was directed at the pagan popula- tion in the town as well as at the increasing influence of Christianity in 161.

Urbach, who very much opposed his understanding, see, most recently, Y. Stern, "Oma- nut Ha-Demut Ba-Halakhah Bi-TeKufat Ha-Mishnah Ve-Ha-Talmud," Tsiyon 61 (1996): 397-398.

Indeed, the title of a recently published volume containing many such views implies a continuous line of development of Jewish artwork containing programmatic messages.

Accordingly, the binding of Isaac, which Gn 22:2 places at a mountain in the "land of Moriah," not only represented promise but a response to Christian appropriation of the Temple Mount, the traditional site of Moriah. E. Revel-Neher goes further, suggesting that the Helios- less zodiac at Sepphoris is a response to both anthropomorphic depictions of the sun-god in paganism and Christ-Helios in Christian iconography.'67 These programmatic readings of the Sepphoris mosaic may be going too far in asserting that the motifs of the floor were aimed at others be- yond the Jewish community be they pagans or Christians.'68 Moreover, programmatic interpretations are difficult to prove and, in any event, the individual who viewed the floor (as opposed to the artist/s) might very well have been inclined to consider each frame in its own right. It is more likely, especially in light of the internal polemic with sun worship inher- ited from the biblical world by the rabbis, that the presentation on the synagogue floors was intended to make sense to an audience that already worshipped there, an audience that drew inspiration from the motifs each time it attended the synagogue. A polemic with external influences would hardly have done that. In addition, S. Fine has suggested that the motifs of the Sepphoris floor are better understood as a reflection of a number of liturgical motifs that, as J. Yahalom and others have shown, can be found in ptyyut literature.169 According to Fine, these motifs were ar- ranged on the floor in order "to complement and give visual expression to the bblcally [emphasis mine] infused prayers."'70 This would have made the floor a readily appreciable element of the liturgical service. So too would have the talmudic understanding of Ps 19, at least where the rabbis were concerned. The question I have raised is whether rabbis, 167.

Without an overarching interpretation, the rabbinic adherent or sympathizer who might have worshipped in these synagogues would have, all the more so, required a mechanism for assimilating the disparate themes of the mosaics. Ps 19 provided just that. The rabbinic understanding of this psalm, which was so obviously de- rived from the polemic implicit in the psalm itself, would have enabled the rabbis and their followers to negotiate the world of these "archaeological" synagogues. This was especially so because what they saw when they viewed these mosaics was not so much a well-worn polemic as an affir- mation of a worldview that was by now long familiar. True, the mosaics first begin to appear at the close of the anioraic period in Eret, Israel, but it is precisely then that our midrashic sources, as we have seen, become richer, building upon earlier biblical and rabbinic tra- ditions. The most vivid and pertinent midrashic evidence comes from Pes- ikta' de-Rav Kahana and Bereshbit Rabbab, two works that were written ca. the fifth century, not long after the zodiac at Hammat Tiberias was likely to have been designed. Within a century or so, mosaic carpets with depic- tions of the sun or Helios were constructed at Bet Alpha, Na'aran, and Sepphoris.'71 Meanwhile, the midrashic preoccupation with Ps 19, al- ready evident in Pewikta' de-Rav Ka/bana and Berwehit Rabbab, persisted, leading to the traditions included in the medieval collections Be-Midbar Rabbab and Pirke de-RabbH Eliezer. Sheniot Rabbab and Midrash Tehillin would further the discussion of Ps 19 and augment the notion, heard earlier in Pesikta' de-Rav Kahana and Bereshit Rabbab, that the heat of the sun was used by God for retribution of the wicked.'72 The lateness of some of these literary sources hardly matters, since they were evidently written at the conclusion of a long exegetical tradition that already under- stood Ps 19 for what it was. Y. Stern has successfully demonstrated that the rabbis only objected to images and statues that came to be worshipped and, therefore, were considered idolatrous. Figurative art like that found in the fourth-to-sixth 171. See n. 16. 172. The allusion in Beres4bit Rabbab 6:17 to a body of water that shields hu- mans from the sun's extreme heat as it goes forth is interesting in light of the fact that the mosaics at Hammat Tiberias and Sepphoris have the chariot arise from a body of water. Weiss and Netzer, Prom*ie and Redemptioti, 35-36, call attention to yAZ 3, 42c, and see the water as an allusion to the cosmocrator's rule over land and sea, which served to depict God's omnipotence. Be that as it may, GenR 6:17 would further connect the mosaic with the exegetical tradition of Ps 19.</page><page sequence="48">74 JQR 94:1 (2004) century synagogues did not pose a problem until around the seventh cen- tury, when iconoclasm took root even among the Jews.'73 Stern's argu- ment is that the sages would have had no difficulty with the zodiac mosaics, precisely because they did not in any way violate halakhalh. The argument I have made here goes further in asserting that the rabbis would have related easily to the diverse imagery of these synagogues, despite its pagan origins. This would have been especially so at Sepphoris, where the mosaic contains rabbinic themes. But it also would have been true at Hammat Tiberias, Bet Alpha, and Na'aran, where a monotheist sufficiently versed in the rabbinic exegesis of Ps 19 would not have taken offense. The Sep- phoris synagogue mosaic may display greater rabbinic influence, but there are a sufficient number of themes included in the zodiac frames of these other synagogues that lend themselves to the same interpretations of Ps 19. We have already seen how talmudic sources place the rabbis in synagogues that were not exclusively theirs. The synagogues of Erets Is- rael in Late Antiquity need not have been wholly "rabbinic" for rabbis to feel welcome. It is, of course, tempting to ask the more prevalent question: How did Jews in general react to these mosaics. Some, undoubtedly, would have had no difficulty relating to the signs of the zodiac and to the personifica- tion of Helios. After all, astrological symbols and understandings of the sun were so much a part of the surrounding culture it would have been surprising if Jews had liot somehow incorporated them into their world view.'74 That is not to say, however, that all Jews would have related to the zodiac with depictions of Helios or the sun at its center in the same way. Some worshippers may have viewed Sol Invictus at Hammat Tiber- ias as an invincible ruler who governed the heavens. Others, may indeed 173.

A Jew who worked the fields below Sepphoris for his sustenance and watched the sunrise over the Bet Netufah valley each day would have related easily to the agricultural themes of the town's fifth- century synagogue mosaic and would have seen the renewal of each day as a reflection of God's love.'76 Many Jews, at Sepphoris and elsewhere, may have concluded, like the rabbis who drew upon biblical tradition, that the four seasons (tekufot) and the months represented by the signs of the zodiac changed and provided sustenance under the watchful eye of God's sun.177 We need not speculate, however, where the rabbis are concerned. They shared the same astrological baggage and Torah of their fellow Jews, but they also drew upon a rich exegetical tradition, which they expanded upon precisely because it enabled them to make sense of the symbols and ideas of the surrounding cultures. If there were some common "program" to speak of in the zodiac mosaics, it would have been that God's Torah was the blueprint of the cosmos, much as it is in Ps 19. After all, the Torah is represented in all of the extant floors by an ark that appears in a panel situated above the zodiac and below the very place where the 175. In a forthcoming article entitled "Helios and the Zodiac in Ancient Pales- tinian Synagogues," J. Magness proposes that Helios and solar imagery in the synagogues floors really depict the archangel Metatron, who in some sources is regarded as a second deity. Rabbinic tradition, at least, strives to portray Meta- tron as an angel, as the story concerning Elisha ben Abuya in bHag 15a indicates. There Elisha's impression that Metatron might be a second "power" is dispelled. Cf. A. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven: Ear-ly Rabbinic Reports4 abontt Clristianity and Gnosticimt (Leiden, 1977), 60-73. If, indeed, Magness is correct, a rabbi who viewed one of the synagogue mosaics discussed here would have seen Metatron/ the sun/Helios as an angel, not a deity. This, of course, would not have prevented others from associating the image at the center of the zodiac with a lesser deity. I am grateful to Professor Magness for providing me with a pre-publication ver- sion of her article. 176. See closing thought below. 177.

This may point to a popular understanding of the relationship of God to the sun similar to that of the rabbis.</page><page sequence="50">76 JQR 94:1 (2004) real 'aron ha-kodesh once stood.'78 Interestingly, by early anioraic times, the rabbis included in the morning prayers a benediction acknowledging God "Who forms light and creates darkness, Who makes peace and creates all things." This unit of prayer concludes with another benediction, "Blessed art Thou Who forms the lights," and then leads to a resounding crescendo in the recitation of the Abavala Rabbab ("great love") prayer. This prayer, together with the recitation of the SheIna that follows, emphasizes that study of Torah is the ultimate expression of love of God.179 Surely it comes as no surprise that by geonic times Ahavah Rabbab included the statement "And enlighten (ha'er) our eyes with your Torah, attach our hearts to your commandments," a sentiment most certainly derived from Ps 19.180 The juxtaposition of the sun (in whichever of its representations) alongside the Torah in the mosaic synagogue floors would obviously have appealed to any "rabbi" who taught Torah in Late Antiquity, for whom it would have been comprehensible and palatable regardless of his com- fort level with figurative art. The synagogues of archaeology and the syn- agogues of the sages need not have been identical, but they were not altogether distinct either. 178. For Hammat Tiberias, see Figure 1. The Sepphoris mosaic has a depic- tion of lions above the band containing the ark. See Weiss and Netzer, Prolnmie and Rdemption, 14-16. On lions in synagogues, see above. It matters little that cultic scenes appear between the zodiac and the ark in the mosaic from Sepphoris (Weiss and Netzer, Promide and Redeinption, 14, 20-24). Several of these scenes, in fact, have accompanying verses, rooting them firmly in the biblical text. The bibli- cal world and that of the rabbis met in this floor in a rather transparent fashion. The Torah remained, however, the focal point. I knowingly resort to a bit of literary license here in my use of "holy ark" ('aron ha-kodesh), which may have been terminology more in vogue in amoraic Babylonia. See bShab 32a and cf. Fine, This Holy Place, 132-134. 179. See bBler Jlb, where third-century amorain- of Erez Israel discuss these benedictions, and see L. A.

The sunrise, which is a phenomenal experience, is interpreted by the berakhah to be a manifestation of God's love, a present act of God's, as it were, the occasion and the belrakhah together constituting a unitary experiential entity. 180.
