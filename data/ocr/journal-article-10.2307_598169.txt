<plain_text><page sequence="1">Le Origini dello Gnosticismo, Colloquio di Messina 13-18 Aprile 1966, XXXII 804 pages. Leiden: E. J. BRILL, 1967. If any lingering doubts remained as to the ex- tent and significance of the Jewish contribution to Gnosticism, the article of Alexander Bdhlig on the Jewish and Jewish Christian background of gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi should be suffi- cient to remove them once and for all. And Bbhlig is not alone. Sazagu Arai, J. Zandee, H. Ringgren, M. Mansoor, G. Jossa, J. Danielou, Y. Janssens, G. Mac Rae, R. M. Grant, all stress the Jewish, apocalyptic, Essene, rabbinic elements in Gnosti- cism. There is no article on esoteric Judaism but K. Rudolph points out learnedly that the Man- deans originate from the Jewish, Palestinian sect of the Nasorees, who in part became Christians and in part moved to Mesopotamia. The perspec- tive of gnostic studies has changed completely since I wrote my article on Christian Gnosticism and Jewish heterodoxy, also contained in the book "The Jung Codex" (1955). Syrian Christianity does not have anything to do with Gnosticism, as Klijn points out. Of course there is Gnosis in the Odes of Solomon, but that does not mean that they presuppose a consistent Gnostic myth of Iranian origin. Not even Bardesanes is a gnostic, as Drijvers shows. The former upholders of the Iranian origin of Gnosticism, the myth of the Saved Saviour, de- fend themselves ably. Widengren gives a lively description of the "Religionsgeschichtliche Schule" and its success among the followers of Bultmann, forgetting to mention that these latter, especially Ernst K5isemann, have completely abandoned the ideas of their master under the influence of Colpe's criticisms. He admits that Reitzenstein made a serious mistake when he built his enormous the- ories upon certain unpublished texts, which he held to be Iranian and which were in fact Manich- ean; Widengren also has ruefully to admit that there is no consistent evidence in Iran for the myth of the Saved Saviour. Yet he maintains that he was always right. H. Jonas has forgotten Oswald Spengler, Hei- degger and Reitzenstein and gives a fine descrip- tion of the gnostic phenomenon and its limitations. Jonas remains sceptical about the Jewish origins of Gnosticism, considering it rather as a violent re- action against Judaism. But he forgets that the Magharians, a Jewish sect, distinguished their God from the creator of the world, an angel with all the anthropomorphic features of the God of the Old Testament. This certainly was a step towards Gnosticism, as Henry Wolfson pointed out. Jews even in Palestine, Aramaic speaking Jews, were adherents of Marcion, the most violent opponent of the God of the Old Testament (Tertullian, Ad- versus Marcionem III, 12: invenies apud Hebraeos Christianos immo et Marcionitas Emmanuelem nominare, cum volunt dicere "nobiscum deus"). After all the characteristic feature of Gnosticism is the split within the Deity. This could develop in a theistic environment, just as the "werdende Gott" of German Idealism developed out of Christian pietism. The defence of Alfred Adam is less satis- factory. He maintains against all probability, that Saklas and Jaldabaoth, two titles of the gnostic demiurge, do not mean "Fool" and "Son of Chaos," as specialists of Aramaic have told us. He holds that Saklas is to be derived from Iranian "agoqar," which means "He who gives generative force"; Jaldabaoth is supposed to be the transla- tion of this term, meaning: "the reproduction of fatherly force." On these shaky foundations he builds the hypothesis that there existed in Baby-</page><page sequence="2">322 Journal of the American Oriental Society, 90.2 (1970) lonia Aramaic Wisdomschools, which are the origin of Gnosticism. Now that the hypothesis of Reitz- enstein is not supported anymore by any living scholar except Widengren, there is a real danger that Iranian influences upon Gnosticism will be neglected. In this volume Closs competently de- scribes certain aspects of early Iranian religion as pre-gnosis. No exact proofs of relations between the two are to be found in other articles. The fas- cinating possibility, that later Iranian religion and later Buddhism has been influenced by Gnosticism, is not discussed at all. Several scholars, among them Ugo Bianchi, have stressed the contribution of Greek civilisation, especially Orphism, to the formation of Gnosticism. These articles, especially those by Boyanc6 and Crakey, are very scholarly and score a point. But much remains here to be done. A Dutch scholar tries to prove that the Hymn of the Pearl is a midrash of the Parable of the Pearl in the Gospel of Thomas and a product of Syrian Christianity; the king in the hymn is God, the mother of the prince the Holy Ghost, his brother the Messiah. The prince himself is the soul, which lived in Paradise and is sent out to the world, symbolised by Egypt. The Pharaoh is the devil, the serpent concupiscence. One misses here a long and detailed article on encratism, as described by Clement of Alexandria in the third book of his Stromateis. Encratism, so very different from Gnosticism, and yet so similar, was very influential in Syria and is responsible for the Gospel of Thomas. It seems hardly believable that anybody who has read Clement on the Encra- tites still can maintain that the Gospel of Thomas is gnostic. But then the Hymn of the Pearl is not gnostic either, let alone a document of pre- christian, Parthian Gnosis. There are many good and not so good articles in this volume that have nothing to do with the ori- gins of Gnosticism. Nor are all the authors compe- tent: on page 265 we read that the Evangelium Veritatis is attributed to Menander (read Valenti- nus); on p. 289 it is said that Gnosticism (includ- ing Manicheism) is not a religion and that there- fore it is absurd to look for its origins in the religious field. Is this serious? The organiser of the Symposion and editor of the volume should have been more severe. But in other respects he has done very well; he shows a keen insight in the gnostic phenomenon and proves to be an excellent organiser. The book is well printed and magnificently published. The greatest specialists on Gnosticism of our time, Gershom Scholem and Henri-Charles Puech, were not pres- ent at the conference. G.
