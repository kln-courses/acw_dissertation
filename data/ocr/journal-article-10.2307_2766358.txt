Mr. Winter's portion of the book contains a translation of Nicolaus Steno's Prodromus and four introductory chapters on the life and work of that early "geologist." The book is splendidly illustrated with eleven plates. It reminds one somewhat of Dr. Singer's earlier Studies in the History and Method of Science, but its appeal, even among students of science history, is considerably restricted, owing to its more specialized subject matter. ALBUREY CASTELL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA The Wisdom of the Body. By WALTER B. CANNON. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. xv +312. A superior distillate, for the educated layman, of modern investigations of the complex chemical and physical factors at work in the body of man and other animals, by a master in this field. In the healthy adult man these diverse forces lead to a dynamic equilibrium or relatively steady state (e.g., the blood pressure, blood volume, heart rate, body size, body weight, etc.), called by Dr. Cannon "homeostasis." The analysis of home- ostasis is the central theme, rendered somewhat anthropomorphic by a title borrowed from the late Professor Starling. The volume, as a whole, is a model in accuracy and lucidity. But the final chapter ("Relation of Biological to Social Homeostasis") is an anticlimax, an excursion into sociological speculation. Argument by analogy may have some merit, if the conclusions lead to experimental tests; otherwise it appears to the re- viewer an infantile pastime if not a nod. This danger of nodding, even on the part of our ablest scientists, when talking too persistently to laymen, crops out but seldom in the scientific chapters of this book. But the head- ing of the Bibliography list is so worded as to make the reader think that all the discoveries and generalizations in physiology of the last hundred years have been made in the author's laboratory in Boston. This is a nod, completely contradicted by the scientific chapters. A. J.
