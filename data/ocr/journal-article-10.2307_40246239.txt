<plain_text><page sequence="1">The City in Post-Romantic Figuration PATRICIA TOBIN Anti-urbanism is a phenomenon almost as old as the city itself, and it has grown more strident as the city has increasingly become the dis- tinctive form of civilization. The city was the achieved center it was meant to be perhaps only for the Greeks, whose urban experience was, after all, of pocketsized city-states more comparable to our affluent and leisure-oriented suburbs than to the metropolises we now know. Since that time, man has managed to figure forth the city as a benef- icent space only to the extent that he has distanced himself from real cities. The unity and perfection of Saint Augustine's City of God emerges essentially through its continuing contrast with the City of the World, which remains a Babel of conflicting cultures beyond either repair or redemption; Dante can found the cities of the Inferno and Paradiso as allegories of divine order, but about the city in the mid- dest he is silent; John Bunyan's pilgrim makes due Protestant prog- ress only when he exits from the earthly City of Destruction and journeys toward the Celestial City; the philosophers of an eighteenth century devoted to empirical fact nevertheless, as Carl Becker has amply demonstrated,1 imitate these Christian narratives in their transcendent ideal of a thoroughly secularized "heavenly city;" and by the time the English Romantics lower their gaze to eye level, Blake's London is already blighting all the songs of innocence, and Wordsworth's London is minimally tolerable only when it is sleeping and he high upon Westminster Bridge. Nor have American poets and thinkers been more hospitable to the city: Hawthorne grimly advised that "all towns should be made capable of purification by fire, or de- cay, within each half-century,"2 Lincoln Steffens published the "shame" of our cities, and Lewis Mumford's preferred metaphors were those of a cancer or a neurosis. Currently, whenever the word "urban" is intoned, it is inevitably followed by the monotonous "problems" or "renewal," and on these joyless occasions it is made clear that the notion of rehabilitation is an empty piety in which no one any longer believes. If the real city has been declared unfit for life, the literary city has proven equally unfit for metaphor. It is interesting to note that al- though the Greeks gave us our first studies of metaphor, they had no ©1981 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 0010-4132/81/0300-0033/$01.70/0 33</page><page sequence="2">34 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES word available to specify "literature," quite possibly because they were inclined to experience their symbolic representations literally. The legendary royal houses of Thebes and Atreus in Golden Age tragedy must have had direct relevance for the fifth-century B.C. Greek who, firmly defined as the man of the polis, took the city's fate and fortune as his own, just as they were for his spokesmen in the tragic choruses who articulated the consensus-wisdom of the city. (TTtie Greek word for man alone and individualized, it may be recalled, was idiotes.) In early European civilization, figurative elabo- ration of the city, like medieval man himself, tended Godward in allegories of Christian salvation. It was not until the ascendance of the realistic novel in the nineteenth century that the human city could hope for a literary habitat; surely here, if anywhere, the city would receive its mimetic likeness, its iconic image, its descriptive truth. But a curious thing happened during and after the novels of Balzac, Zola, Dickens, James, and Dreiser: Almost as soon as the enormous figurai potential of the city was recognized in its variety, dispersal, and randomness did these very attributes combine to frus- trate projects of mimetic representation. The realism-contract was breeched in the moment when the plenty of city life could not be re-presented in its full and confusing detail. Thus, the novel had to settle for less than a complete fictional revelation of the city - for "a slice of life" or a "dramatic circle," for the city as scenic back- drop to psychology and plot, for cityfolk as types and stereotypes, or for the city as a reductive symbol of evil. By the end of the nine- teenth-century, the earthly city in all its fascinating complexity, having been found unsuitable for either metonymical or metaphor- ical affirmative action, was once again almost universally demonized. It would appear that the literary demonization of the city owes almost as much to the city's resistance to figurative development as it does to the difficulties of urban living (which in no manner do I wish to minimize). The point can perhaps be clarified through a con- trast between the city and the country as objects of figuration. Many have spoken of the two together, to the city's detriment; here is Emerson on the subject: The City delights the Understanding. It is made up of finites: short, sharp, mathematical lines, all calcu- lable. It is full of varieties, of successions, of contriv- ances. The Country, on the contrary, offers an unbro- ken horizon, the monotony of an endless road, of vast uniform plains, of distant mountains, the melancholy of uniform and infinite vegetation; the objects on the road are ever few and worthless, the eye is invited ever to the horizon and the clouds. It is the school of Reason.3</page><page sequence="3">TOBIN 35 The motive for going to the clouds for schooling is perfectly clear: A seamless unity in nature lends itself readily to the single analogy - personification, simile, metaphor, symbol - that the holistic poetic imagination desires. No poet of the city has ever come away from its jagged edges and bad meshes with figures so grand as Coleridge's "esemplastic force," Wordsworth's "characters of the great Apoc- alypse," or Hopkins' "news of God." The vast undifferentiation of landscape on which can be overlaid almost any imagined figure - this, as much as city-man's nostalgia for Eden, assures that our trans- cendent versions will all be pastoral. Emerson can be very specific about the problem of the city for the visionary poet: "Whilst we want cities as the center where the best things are to be found, cities degrade us by magnifying trifles. The countryman finds the town a chop-house, a barbershop. He has lost the grandeur of the horizon."4 As we have seen, the only city that meets the "grandeur of the hori- zon" is the city of allegory "where the best things are to be found" as the transcendentally ideal; within a Romantic aesthetic, the "tri- fles" of the deortitered and decentefing human city delegate it to the mere calculating operations of mechanical form and degenerate Fancy. This real fact of the city's digitalization - especially when it assumes derogatory human relevance as atomization and alienation - insures that any figures rising from such a surface will be demonic. Are there no figurai options for the city in this century, then, other than the demonic symbol? Literature, happily, always refuses to take no for an answer. For numerous authors from several na- tional literatures, the city has become an exemplary corpus delicti upon which to resurrect new figurai life. And in each case that we shall consider, - William Carlos Williams, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Julio Cortâzar, Italo Calvino - figurai fecundity is dependent upon a lib- eration from the Romantic symbol and a preference for tropes less familiar to literary use, yet nevertheless firmly established within the larger system and process of language. The familiar vocabulary of the Romantic aesthetic, with its immense over-privileging of the symbol, will therefore be predictably inadequate to the task of understanding what is truly novel in postmodern literature; we need, rather, to ap- propriate the lexicon of a discipline that locates, without valorizing, the symbol within a sign-system that includes all the other figurai possibilities. We need, in short, to make a brief raid on semiotics, before tracking the texts of the contemporary poets of the city.5 For any inquiry into the movements of figuration within literary texts and through literary history, semiotics provides a complete theory of representation; that is, it is responsive at once to the logic of the word-as-a-sign, and to its genesis and elaboration within a series of operations. Semiotics thus yields both a code and the linear program for writing and reading that code, both synchronie system</page><page sequence="4">36 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES and diachronic process. The basic unit of any sign-system emerges from a relationship between that which is signified and that which signifies; and as man learns to multiply the meanings he can assign to experience - as he progressively swerves away from lack of dif- ferentiation toward escalating significations - the relationships be- tween signified and signifier also shift. These stages in a develop- mental process, each complete in itself yet each dependent upon operations established in earlier stages, may be schematized as six ratios, divided between two distinct series of operations, the second of which repeats and internalizes the first. The first series of coding procedures, which constitute primary articulation, are common to higher mammals, the infant, and primitive man. These are the direct, immediate dyadic relationships between agent and object that do not require the triadic mediation of language. The ratios within primary articulation are signal, index, and icon. The signal is the first notice of an initial difference as an impulse or event, the first swerve away from undifferentiated noise that is basic to any information system. Index is the minimal reference assigned to this difference that occurs with the repetition of the signal; index acknowledges a correlation between two distinct scales of operations and establishes these hap- penings as elements in a code of relationship - a direct, dual relation- ship between sign and object, independent of mind or logic. The final phase of the icon produces the genesis of the sign as the outcome of the primary series. Basing itself upon the resemblance inherent in the indexical ratio, the icon produces a closed schema of representation, the first figure of the signified/signifier as the normative unit of the system. This stabilization makes of the iconic stage a bridge between pre-literate and literate man: Difference is made to signify resem- blance not only in the look-alikes of the voodoo doll and hieroglyphs, but also in our maps and diagrams, and in the assumed similitude of literary mimesis, where the analogic correspondence likewise pertains, not between image and thing but between word and thing. The secondary series, whose ratios occur within the mediation of language, defines the schemes of representation possible within a system established on difference. This is where human intention- ality formally enters the system - where man has so internalized the primary series that it is aconscious and automatic; whereby he forgets that he has been coding and "writing" the world, and makes the great leap toward decoding, interpreting, and "reading" a world that rever- berates to elements in his psychic life. The three ratios of secondary representation are symbol, sign, and allegory, each of which repeats, while it cancels and supercedes, the earlier series. Just as the signal notes the first trace of difference, so the symbol internalizes a con- ceptual figure for an existent iconic schema. (This part of the semi- otic series is beautifully exemplified by Keats's "Ode to Psyche."6)</page><page sequence="5">TOBIN 37 Just as the index takes up and defines the signal as an element within a code, so the sign liberates the symbol from both its iconic schema and its psychic concept, and situates itself within a chain of circu- lating signifiers independent of the signified (as in "signs of the times''). And just as the icon closed off the primary series of opera- tions as its first figure, so allegory is the figure that effects the ulti- mate closure on the logic and history of the entire semiotic sequence. From this terminal phase, allegory permits the system to be per- ceived as recursive, as interprétable either forward or backward. If read prospectively, from the view of writing as the goal of the sys- tem, then we may say, with Keats and with C.S. Peirce, that man's symbolization is a repetition "in a finer tone" and that dyadic rela- tions are always "degenerate;" however, with equal justification we may interpret the system, to use Williams' phrase, "against the grain" of such a progress, simply by adopting the retrospective glance of a reader who has acquired the competency to read any written system. From this belated perspective of allegory, man's representations through symbolization are but reductions of and subtractions from an original abundance - a devolutionary movement whereby we descend from an uncentered primary organism feverishly coding a plenitudinous environment which is almost all circumference, to the human psyche as a command-control center that in its decoding ac- tivity manipulates an entire universe in accordance with human desire. The authors of this study all assume this second, post- Romantic stance. Figurative innovators and competent readers, they are acutely aware of their late entrance upon the fields of literature; city dwellers all, they have first-hand experience of the anti-urbanism surfacing everywhere in an advanced civilization. Although they know, as we do, what it is to live in the shadows of catastrophic aftermath, in a world that sometimes seems post-every thing, belatedness is not for them a burden but rather the first chance for decentering the reign- ing demonic-ironic symbol and restoring the neglected figurai op- tions of index, icon, and retrospective allegory. Before analyzing these various projects of restoration, it might be instructive to consider, in contrast, a major literary work of this cen- tury that is all but paralyzed by the sense of belatedness. Our text is that central document of modernism, The Waste Land, long lauded as the definitive symbolist poem of the twentieth century (over Eliot's objection that "for me it was only the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life: it was just a piece of rhyth- mical grumbling"7 ). From our present perspective as readers, Eliot's poem is most pertinently a poetic allegory of belatedness. Its oppres- sively comprehensive footnotes serve constantly to remind its readers that we are forever-aftering, and that what we are reading are the residual shadows and echoes, the late and minor-key re-presentations,</page><page sequence="6">38 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES of the not-now and the not-here. Eliot is the archaeologist prowling about a literature in ruins - not so very unlike Walter Benjamin, who haunted the belated cities of Europe, reading their ruined artifacts as the icons that would yield a Marxist allegory of late commodity capi- talism.8 The great originals whom Eliot excavates from the past - Tiresias, Ecclesiastes, Dante, Spenser, Baudelaire, and even the Count- ess Marie - enjoy but a figurative half-life, especially in the half-light of the company they keep in the poem's present. Madame Sosostris, Stetson, Mr. Smyrna, the chess-game couple, the ladies at the pub, the typist and her lunch-hour lover - all those who are suffocating on the banality of anomie are already the tiresomely decoded signs, typical and stereotypical, of a time too belated for redemption. Eliot's best hope for restoration, for the retrieval of firstness, was aligned with the anthropological material of the poem, where he traces back from the allegorical Grail legends to indexical vegetation rites, and back from the symbolic Anglican burial service to the iconic fire-sermon of the Buddha. But ultimately these retrievals are not poetically persuasive: they are silenced by the clamoring death râle of a civilization too far gone for the resurrection of ritual or the peace of prayer. Consumed by the symbolic dead-end of be- latedness, The Waste Land remains a cortege of poetic figures, a great dead poem of the dead. It was left to Eliot's contemporary, Dr. Williams of Rutherford, to bring to the city an approximation of firstness - in Paterson, a poem conceived from the outset as an exploration of unmapped semiotic territory. Williams' description of the genesis of his poem is clearly an invitation to learn the tropes of a new poetic space: "I took the city as my 'case' to work up, to really work it up. It called for a poetry such as I did not know. ... it WôuW be itself, locally, and so like every other place in the world. For it is in that, that it be particular to its own idiom, that it lives."9 If Paterson, with its momentary blockages and its abrupt thematic shifts, pre- sents the aspect of a messy first draft or a creation-myth in progress, it is because Williams meant such rhythms to mime iconically the "idiom" of the living city that takes its chances with the fragmented and random. Instead of a particular standing in metaphorically for the universal (as, for instance, Tiresias in The Waste Land symbolizes humanity), Williams wants a universal that is merely the metonymical completion of all the particulars (as the totality of its citizens com- plexly completes "the city"). Unlike Eliot, when Williams excavates - as, for example, in Paterson's tabular account of the artisian well - the dig yields a total spectrum of shades and densities of stone, which are specified quantitatively but remain qualitatively unrecuperable for figuration. Williams, in fact, is no archaeologist: the lesson of the sub- stratum for him is that "the surface glistens, only the surface. Dig in -</page><page sequence="7">TOBIN 39 and you have a nothing, surrounded by a surface, an inverted bell sounding." In a late stage of civilization, when the impulse to rise above or delve beneath the surface for symbolic transcendence is endemic, to stay at the surface in literature is a poetically radical decision with wide-ranging effects. It means that Williams will search for the "radi- ant gist that resists the final crystallization" of the symbol, and that he will "work up" the city by resolutely working it down. In this particular poetic project, ineptitude becomes a virtue so that dis- sonance may lead to discovery. The poem begins with the poet's acknowledgement of his place in the impoverished park of poetry: To make a start out of particulars and make them general, rolling up the sum, by defective means - Sniffing the trees just another dog among a lot of Dogs. What else is there? And to do? The rest have run out - after the rabbits. Only the lame stands - on three legs. Scratch front and back. Deceive and eat. Dig a musty bone For the beginning is assuredly the end . . . Heretofore, a symbolist poetics, in its elitist assumption that lan- guage must necessarily heighten experience, had warned that liter- ature was posted property: "No Dogs Allowed at Large in This Park." Williams' primary dissembling in Paterson, whereby he undoes Ro- mantic poetics, is one of direct, unmediated, pre-linguistic relation: the poet-as-unleashed-dog has immediate knowledge of other dogs through the sense of smell, and he reciprocates by marking the trees directly with the scent of his own identity. Paterson is a surface of such markings or - to use the term from semiotics - such indexes. Within language the index enacts the direct presence to perception and cognition of a dyadic exchange, the closest human parallel to the reactions of physical force that occur between a pair of particles. In the immediacy of stimulus/response interactions, either member of the exchange may serve as the index of the other, without evoking the mediation of a symbolizing third force. With his heavy reliance upon the index, which prevails at the beginning of man's sign-systems</page><page sequence="8">40 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES and prior to humankind's secondary representations, Williams appro- priates a formal strategy of firstness that is perfectly coincident with his thematic concerns. The achievement of Paterson, then, is an artistic lying that simu- lates the devolution of experience from the symbolic to the indexi- cal. The poem's characteristic utterance is performative, exclama- tory, and imperative - the linguistic counterpart to the pointed in- dex finger or the cry as signal: "Look! Listen! Gone! A wonder!" Its typical shift of subject and tone is signaled by similar asides of a poet-dog to himself: "Poet. Are you there? .... Go home. Write. Compose .... Forget it! For God's sake, cut out that stuff." The rancid deformities of the written symbolic surface in the letters from Paterson's neurotic female correspondent, and in the false ac- cents of newspaper prose straining for elegance, and these are always juxtaposed unfavorably with iconic documentation of various kinds: the photograph from the National Geographic, city records, tran- scripts of conversations, historical scenes flatly rendered, personal letters - anything, as Ginsberg says in his letter, that might con- tribute to "a statement of fact about misery (not misery itself)." For Williams, all language is ultimately plagued by deceit, and the language of an advanced civilization offers an advanced case of the blight. Thus he prefers the unarticulated roar of the Passaic Falls, or the great falls-jumper whose body-language failed him in mid-air ("There's no mistake in Sam Patch!"), or his own imagination that is "a rubble bank disintegrating under a tropic downpour." For Wil- liams, the mental goes back to the physical, speech is but breath, and the city of Paterson is only lastly the symbolic man Paterson, but firstly the "giant in whose apertures we/ cohabit, unaware of what air supports/ us - ." In returning us to our main support sys- tem, to the breath from which we make our words, William Carlos Williams has restored the city as a site of primary experience. It is an overdue and exemplary restoration. Alain Robbe-Grillet shares with Williams the conviction that sur- face is all and that both interiority and metaphor are suspect, but when he returns the city to a site, it does not permit of even an in- dexical interaction between people and things. Rigorously, even pro- grammatically post-modern, Robbe-Grillet directs his cautionary tales to contemporary man as a warning of how he has gone wrong. The large error lies in our humanistic expectation of a connectedness be- tween man and nature, a hope that inevitably fails and gives way to the false, bourgeois tragedy of alienation and our willful imposition of a compensatory symbolization upon the neutral stuff of the world. Robbe-Grillet 's first novel, The Erasers (Les Gommes, 1953), was conceived as the nouveau roman that was to erase all traces of this perverse symbolic. The city of The Erasers is a setting remark-</page><page sequence="9">TOBIN 41 ably ill-designed for the specifications of human desire, alien at once to psychic comfort and figuration. It is a site that grudgingly satisfies only the minimal creature needs - food, sleep, communication - never the complex requirements of escalated desire. Indeed, it is this dehumanized space that anticipates those later characterizations of Robbe-Grillet's work as l'école du regard ("Man looks at the world and the world does not look back") and as chosiste ("Things are there, before being something9'). The walker in this city is Wallas, who must be disabused of any notion (presumably shared by the reader) of a humanized time and space. As a detective, skilled in tracing backwards a cohesive linear course between effect (corpse) and cause (murderer), Wallas discovers that his timepiece has stop- ped, and that there is to be no corpse in this circular horror story until he himself pulls the trigger. No more than he can construct a plausible narrative can Wallas reach a plausible destination within his fictional city. Meticulously following directions and signposts which appear to assume the right and left perpendiculars of a well- ordered urban space, Wallas is stopped again and again by an insidi- ous "Boulevard Circulaire." Nothing in The Erasers, it seems, offers itself to the completions of secondary representation. In the essays of For a New Novel (Pour un nouveau roman, 1963) Robbe-Grillet reiterates his commitment to the cleansing of a uni- verse all too contaminated by the human. The distance, separation, and cleavage so common to city-life, he argues, need not yield a suffering so raised to the heights of sublime necessity that we re- quire the consolations of symbolization. The symbol, as the essen- tial trope that reconciles man and the universe, is not innocent; it is profoundly implicated with an anthropomorphic vocabulary serv- ing the "old myths of depth" and the pathos at the "romantic heart of things." The objects in Robbe-Grillet's novels, so often appropri- ate to an urban environment, are meant to indicate a world merci- fully without qualities. In itself, fragmentation is not bad, and it may even be refreshing. However, when two corks and a little piece of wood bobbing in a canal are taken as a human face, then as a Punch and Judy doll, and finally as the legendary Sphinx, then man's dangerous, symbolic lust has falsified thingness into "evi- dence, "and interpretation follows its own trail of spurious "clues" to the "Oedipus," sprinkled liberally throughout the novel. For Robbe-Grillet, the literary prevention and cure of this interpretive delirium begins with an impartial inspection of things, the very op- posite of poetic writing. The importance of optical description in his work, as Roland Barthes noted very early,10 is that its visual rigor is so neutral that it cannot lead to the reflectiveness that prompts symbolic mediation. The word that contents itself with measuring, locating, limiting, and defining difference - in brief,</page><page sequence="10">42 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Emerson's unhappy "calculable" - opens up a "new realism," one that is not the sordid bore which naturalistic writers, for example, have made of the city. "Nothing is more fantastic, ultimately," Robbe-Grillet assures us, "than precision." As proof, he cites as the most realistic of authors, Kafka, whose literalism was so overly pre- cise that he could be critically understood only as an allegorist. If Robbe-Grillet 's city is inhospitable to his detective - after all, it makes a murderer of him - it is perhaps because Wallets misreads it very much as Kafka's critics have misread Kafka. By assuming a hidden meaning behind an apparent one, they feed their appetite for interpretation that will then force coherence and consistency upon that which is partial and inconcludable. The ultimate, nega- tive, demystifying truth of things is that locally, in their locales, things are unreceptive to man's global ambition to order the uni- verse. We are thus left with the sobering recognition that our sym- bolic systems are but closed circuits of signifieds, in which the world's signifiers do not participate. This very Otherness of the city is Julio Cortâzar's main compo- sitional resource. An alien himself, with a foot in two continents, Cortâzar has always been that "extraterritorial" wanderer between worlds and languages, superbly suited, according to George Steiner's argument,11 to carry the new word to literature. Born in Buenos Aires and a long-time resident of Paris, Cortâzar has habituated him- self to the trans- Atlantic phenomenon, the doubling of absence and presence, that is a major theme of his work. Like the other authors in the "boom" of contemporary Latin- American literature, Cortâ- zar inherits an America unplagued by the burdens of belatedness, where "almost all is yet to be written;" and this firstness of the new world seems to carry over to his transformations of the cities of the old world. Consider the affinities that the city would have for a writer who describes his preferred narrative technique as "mo- saic" (the fitting together of narrative bits into spatial designs, rather than long temporal strands), who desires his work to be "porous" (open to every kind of ambivalence and closed to tendencies of one- ness or "tremendism"), and who, 21s a jazz musician and admirer of the Surrealists, is attracted to the "arhythmia of reality, its excep- tions and its illogicalities." In times past, the literary intransigence of the city has been often due to the resistance of its multiplicity to a single, figurai imprint; however, within Cortâzar's "perspective of total fracturing," the city comes into its porous, mosaic, arhyth- mic own.12 For Cortâzar, the enabling quality of the city is an otherness that permits its figuration as the outside of humanized experience. All of his works give ample house space to these "paravisions," these views of humanity from the fracturing perspective of the Other, who is lo-</page><page sequence="11">TOBIN 43 cated at the circumference of the centered self of I/eye. The para- visionary Other sees human beings acting in ordinary and exception- al ways, but has access to no script that would decode their behavior in terms of a human thematics, psychology, or destiny; consequently, Cortazar's characters appear at once very human and distractingly non-human, in-the-flesh puppets. To write from paravisionary other- ness forces a reader "to excentrate towards a center which is none- theless inconceivable" - inconceivable because Cortâzar's untradi- tional otherness is neither transcendental nor allegorical. This is to convert Emerson's complaint - that the city promises a center and delivers merely "trifles" - into a salute to a polyvalent reality where everything is "trifles." When exocentricity, long a stubborn fact of metropolitan structures, assumes such exalted literary value, then the decentered and decentering city may be saved for positive fig- uration. The old negatives, no longer deviations from a norm, can now be retrieved for affirmation from the sumptuous margins of the exocentric vision: Nothing - except the egocentric, and now eccentric, view from the symbolic self - prevents us from perceiving negative maladjustments, misunderstandings, incoherence, and irra- tionalities as positive alchemies, osmoses, permutations, collabora- tions, and collisions of several simultaneous modes of reality. This paravisionary shift in Cortâzar's fiction at once elides any clear boundary between the real and the fantastic and allows a lit- eralization of the figurative. The process begins with an accelerating contamination of the inside by the outside, with a leakage of the un- canny into the quotidian that will culminate in flood. In Hopscotch (Rayuela, 1963) the boundary seems to hold in the first two section titles: Paris is "From This Side" and Buenos Aires is "From the Other Side." But undecidability irreversibly enters with the third section, "From Diverse Sides," which features the notebooks of an omnivor- ous literary philosopher named Morelli; according to authorial in- structions, these may be read after the preceding two parts or inter- spersed in a dictated order among the other chapters. There is a pen- alty associated, however, with choosing the linear order of the ego- centric reader: Unless the reader opts for interspersing the subtitled "expendable chapters" of Section Three, he will believe that the book ends determinately with the "paff!" of a suicide leap in the final chapter 56 of Section Two, whereas the paravisionary reader will know there are at least two alternative endings in the intermin- ably indeterminate and rotating chapters of 58-131-58-131, etc. Thematically, it is the nature and the strategies of the quest un- dertaken by the protagonist Oliveira that open all sides to the af- firmative "irrealities" of otherness. In pursuit of the "freedom of the city," and through a willed alienation or "professional abnega- tion," Oliveira hopes to reach a state of wisdom in which apparent</page><page sequence="12">44 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES disorder yields a peculiar harmony, a unity that is like the "vortex of a whirlwind." For the exocentric Oliveira, this unity must encompass both La Maga of Paris and the Argentine couple, Talia and Traveler. Reminiscent of Breton's Nadja, La Maga is like a "materialized neb- ula," lost to normal fictional characterization and lost to Oliveira in Paris; in contrast, Oliveira 's best friend Traveler is the "man of the territory . . . the ordinary man who carries five thousand years of culture in his frame." Whosoever would comprehend these highest and lowest of human frequencies cannot do so by establishing a con- trast or continuum between them; instead, one situates oneself at the vortex, where binary oppositions do not for the moment per- tain - where, for example, successful attainment looks very much like suicide. Why not conclude the quest, then, with the child-rite of hopscotch, where a pebble and a hop on one foot get you Home to Heaven, a paravisionary vortex if ever there was one? So it is that, when Talia/La Maga is standing in square three and Traveler/Oliveira in square six, from a window in the asylum high above them Oli- veira plunges to square nine. The freedom of the city is thus identi- fied as the freedom to jump to a conclusion - to convert logos to a verb, to literalize a human metaphor, to get oneself Home. Cortâzar's 62: A Model Kit (62: Modelo para armar, 1968) has its genesis in fragment #62 of Morelli's notebooks, a note toward a novel: Psychology, a word with the air of an old woman about it. A Swede is working on a chemical theory of thought. Chemistry, electromagnetism, the secret flow of living matter, everything returns strangely to evoke the idea of mana; in a like manner, on the edge of social behavior, one might suspect an interaction of a different nature, a billiard game that certain in- dividuals play or are played at, a drama with no Oedipuses, no Rastignacs, no Phaedras, an impersonal drama . . . London, Paris, and Vienna are the cities of 62, but none of them is the City. Their hotels, cafes, and museums are the watering places of a group of disenchanted, displaced Europeans and Latin Americans. These cities comprise the Zone, where these wanderers meet to com- pare notes, tell stories, and experience relationships on this side of desire, will, sympathy, and conviction. The Zone is the site of confi- dent symbolization, a comfortable area that confirms both the ex- clusive view of the self and man's narratizing power over circum- stances. The City of 62 (and Cortâzar refuses it the flaming capital letters of allegory) is neither these cities nor their Zone. It is, chill-</page><page sequence="13">TOBIN 45 ingly, on the other side, where human will has little bearing - the place of nightmare and the uncanny, the "inconceivable center" of a universe that does not order itself according to human reflection. In the Zone of real and symbolic cities, one has news of the city as a "point of unbearable reality," as a fleeting "coagulation in flight," as a sudden, dizzying massing of all the possible resonances of a pos- sible chord, as an "initial hollow" that cannot be filled in by reas- suring analogies. The uncanny, which Freud explained largely as the time-return of déjà vu, is here a vertiginous substitution and simul- taneity of all times. As might be expected of such paravisions, Cor- tâzar's puppets receive them when they are "beside themselves," when an exalted and exceptional version of each self, the paredros, has taken over from the parameters of experience. In 62 coincidence has been returned to its root meaning - not to the Latin incidere "to fall upon," suggesting a chanciness outside of normal causality, but to the more radical Greek koinos "common, to exist together, with, jointly." The constellations of coincidence range from small to large, but in any "model kit" of the universe, we are given to understand, coincidence will stand revealed as the characteristic structure and process of its reality. The implications are sinister in 62, the more so as terror coincides with innocence at the vortex. The final view of Nicole on the barge with an apparently benign old bag-lady coincides horrifically with the legend of the Viennese countess who bled her servant girls; with the scandal of Monsieur Ochs, who stuffed his infamous dolls with replicas of mutilated genitalia; with Helene's lesbian rape of the young Celia; and with the midnight rituals, possibly vampire, between a middle- aged woman tourist and a proper English schoolgirl. In a book where so much proceeds from diverse sides, it is significant that its across-sides protagonist is a translator. With paravisionary coincidence, Cortâzar has played out the re- iterated apostrophe of The Waste Land, Eliot's "Unreal city," and exposed the alogic of the "unrealness" that underwrites all the tropes in the semiotic program. Within the flow of animated matter, which primary articulation and secondary representation both overwrite, the tropes are de-realized; when any one of them surfaces again in the city, it can no longer ("After such knowledge, what forgive- ness?") be mistaken for a signified and thus find its place in a theme of description, but it is immediately taken as a signifier, a sign from the other side. Cortâzar himself views this displacement and muta- tion with equanimity, suggesting that "life is trying to change its key in and through and by them," and ahead of the process is a "trans- cendence within whose limits man is waiting." One becomes human, it would seem, by insisting less upon the centrality of human con- cerns - by the "acceptance of the pebble and Beta Centauri" - and</page><page sequence="14">46 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES by the serene conviction that otherness is the condition of the ap- pearance of not only the new man, but also the new word. Italo Calvino shrouds the literary city with a magic cloak of in- visibility, that it might shine more brilliantly as the city of allegory. From the outside of the outside, where the logic of a system may be read out of its completed history, Calvino gives us the category of "city." Continuing the postmodern assault on the middle distance, he abolishes the two poles that are required for either the indexical connections of Williams or the severed connections of Robbe-Grillet; at the phase of allegory, where aesthetic and human desires are all realized, there are no negotiations of between-ness with the real. In Invisible Cities the mimetic image is absent and the concept is all, and because "city" never has direct reference to a single real city, it can become the unit of infinitely creative possibility. In- visible Cities thus satisfies all of these definitions of it: a catalog of forms and a tribute to man's form-making powers; a dream of artis- tic liberty and a record of how men have pursued that dream; a fabu- lation of imagined cities, into which the details of real ones may be fitted, and a démystification of that fabulation in terms of semiotic process. Calvino instructs us that indeed any fact or figure will become fantasmatic when it is seen to participate in a system of coding un- familiar to us. As a complement of Borges' Chinese encyclopedia, he offers a taxonomy of cities that similarly defies our Western logic of classification. There are over fifty cities in this slim volume, each oc- cupying but a page or two, sharing equal space with other cities scat- tered throughout the book in recurring disarray. Thus Calvino's cities are classified as thin, continuous, trading, or hidden - in adjectival anarchy - or else they are conjunctively (dis)ordered in relation to sky, desire, eyes, names, the dead, and signs. By the time the reader finishes the table of contents, the cord between these cities and em- pirical cities has already been cut. But perhaps the most original allegorical strategy is the confla- tion of the metonymical and metaphorical axes of language, which occurs in Calvino's scrambled space/time accounts of his cities. Typ- ically, we are accustomed-to making a clear choice between two de- scriptive techniques for the city: the city is represented either as a spatial, synchronie, and geometric configuration - or as a temporal, diachronic, and anecdotal narrative. The typical movement of Cal- vino's writing, however, weaves space with time, system with story, and image with plot - the whole spectrum of semiotic ratios avail- able at the late stage of allegory. Here, for example, is Zaira, the city of high bastions: I could tell you how many steps make up the</page><page sequence="15">TOBIN 47 streets rising like stairways, and the degrees of the arcades' curves, and what kind of zinc scales cover the roofs; but I already know this would be the same as telling you nothing. The city does not consist of this, but of relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its past: the height of a lamppost and the distance from the ground of a hanged usurper's swaying feet; the line strung from the lamppost to the railing opposite and the festoons that decorate the course of the queen's nuptial procession; the height of that railing and the leap of the adulterer who climbed over it at dawn; the tilt of a guttering and a cat's progress along it as he slips into the same window; the firing range of a gunboat which has suddenly appeared beyond the cape and the bomb that destroys the guttering; the rips in the fishnet and the three old men seated on the dock mending nets and telling each other for the hun- dredth time the story of the gunboat of the usurper, who some say was the queen's illegitimate son, abandoned in his swaddling clothes there on the dock.13 Zaira is a city that soaks up memories but cannot itself tell them un- til someone reads all its signs at the surface: it instructs us in the privileged place of allegory at the closure of process. Calvino's other cities are also marvelous parables of semiotic states and processes. Zoe, the city with indistinguishable boundaries and unspecifiable features, exposes the source of our long enchantment with sym- bolic landscape; and the metropolis Maurilia, inhabited by a popu- lace obsessed with the postcards of an ancient and provincial Maur- ilia, uncovers the nostalgia of a city culture for the unspoiled coun- tryside. Of the subjective desire that propels our symbolizing activ- ities we learn from Despina, a border city between desert and sea, which the camel driver imagines as a gigantic ship, and the sailor, as a great camel. The inventive alternatives to literary realism are stored in the museum, of the gray-stone metropolis of Fedora, where all kinds of little Fedoras are preserved in glass globes; and all trans- cendent imaginers are served warning by the example of Perinthia, the city built by the astronomers to reflect the harmony of the firm- ament, and inhabitated now exclusively by monsters. Notions of classical time and space are shaken by Calrice, whose history turns out to be only "a given number of objects shifted within a given space;" by Berenice, where all the future and opposing Berenices</page><page sequence="16">48 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES are contained in each present instant; by Leonia, a city of increasing- ly classy garbage, whose citizens begin each day with everything new - and the more the city expels, the more it accumulates. In Invisible Cities, where construction vies with deconstruction and entropie dis- order ever threatens, the reader is always being urged to meditate upon the attractions and dangers inherent in his own symbolizing activity. The promise that symbolization holds out for completion and symmetry can never be realized within the round-dance of semi- otic figuration, given as it is to the repetitions that transform ex- haustion into renewal and disorder into new orders within the whirl of its phases. Calvino's cities are framed by interface chapters, themselves a scene of belatedness entirely appropriate to the allegorical mode. In the magnolia gardens of Kai-ping-fu the young Marco Polo brings tid- ings of his vast kingdom to the aged Genghis Khan. Marco Polo is pri- marily a mute informant. Their conversations are comprised of many pauses, spaces for the sharing of mental communications of a "zodiac of the mind's phantasms." When Polo is at his most audible in convey- ing his explorer's tales, he employs gestures as indexes and objects as icons. From the bric-a-brac arranged on a chessboard, the great Khan searches out the invisible order of cities which sustains their shapes and histories. By depriving the cities of their sensory detail, Calvino serves the allegorical enterprise of reducing them to their essence; but he is too aware of the fortunes of figuration not to include the re- cursive return built into the system. For when all the chessmen are removed and there is an empty square that looks very much like nothingness, "Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows ..." Man always begins anew to read and write his world; there is never a full stop in the interpretive endeavor. The regeneration of figures out of the exhaustion of forms - per- haps this point on the circle of figuration is as good a one as any at which to conclude this initial inquiry into the literary city. It has been filled in by a primary series of tropes and emptied out by a secondary; confined to topology, it has been freed for tropology. And just now, there are more tropes than the Romantic and modernist imaginations dreamed of in their city of the demonic symbol. For the postmodern poet of the city, there seem to be illimitable figurai options that es- chew the symbol. For Susan Sontag, for instance, "The city is neither a jungle nor the moon nor the Grand Hotel. In long shot: a cosmic smudge, a conglomerate of bleeding energies. Close up, it is a fairly legible printed circuit, a transistorized labyrinth of beastly tracks, a data-bank for asthmatic voice-prints."14 For poetic script, as well as for the camera eye, the city functions within a sign-system - one that is available for our reading and writing, coding and decoding,</page><page sequence="17">TOBIN 49 exhaustion and replenishment.

For what follows, it is difficult to specify my indebtedness, since all of my borrow- ings are tangential and my use of them is not clearly stipulated in the sources themselves. I first encountered the six-phase semiotic series in Roland Barthes, Writing Degree Zero/ Elements of Semiology, trans. Annette Lavers and Colin Smith (Boston: Beacon, 1970), pp. 35-38. Barthes proposes a classification of sign within a matrix of the five other no- tional terms used by various philosophers of language, his point being that no matter what terminology may be used, this sequence pertains. From among Barthes' selection, I chose the terms of C.S. Peirce. Especially useful were the first and third volumes of The Col- lected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, eds. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1931-1958), v. 1-8. A more informal and relaxed recounting may be found in Semiotic and Signifies: The Correspondence between Charles S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby, ed. Charles S. Hardwick (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1977), especially pp. 22-35. The semiotic series here presented seems also to correlate at every point with Harold Bloom's mapping of images, tropes, psychic defenses, and revisionary ratios; see A Map of Misreading (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975), p. 84. My most recent and most direct debt is to my Rutgers colleague, Paul Miers; see his "Avertissement: Fourfold Vortex Formulations of Differance in Derridian Cryptograms," MLN 92 (1977), 1049-1051. 6.
