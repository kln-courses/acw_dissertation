Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2010 (Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen der Deut schen Orient-Gesellschaft 131). Ausgrabungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft in Assur F: Fundgruppen, Band 3. IX + 268 Seiten, 55 Tafeln. ISBN 978-3-447 06244-2. 78,00 €. The volume is the catalogue of over 700 ivory and bone artefacts stemming from the famous excavations conducted in Assur at the beginning of the 20th century and preserved in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin. It is part of the very com mendable over-ten-years-long efforts in (re)publishing the finds and evidence from this important excavation of the German Oriental Society (Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft), i.e., the "Assur-Projekt" directed by Johannes Renger. Seen the interest of this specific material, the wide majority of projects on an cient Near Eastern sites with ivory and bone finds have provided either partial or extensive publication of this category of artefacts (think Nimrud to Ugarit). The Author too joins in this tradition with the explicit aim of covering the ivory findings from the old excavations in Assur in their entirety. While he thus fully integrates the few and isolated pieces known until now to the public, he correctly takes care to underline that finds from such an old archaeological project are not apt for carrying out modern scientific analyses, such as they have become standard nowadays (p. 2 fn. 7). Therefore, the process of determining whether a piece was ivory or bone was achieved through macroscopic optical analysis by the Author himself, since the determination with the current scientific analytical methods "could not be carried out in agreement to the conservational needs of the Museum" (p. 2 fn. 9). Where uncertainties remained the Author rightly chose to exclude these pieces from statis tical evaluation of the bulk of finds according to material. The publication is structured in four chapters. After an introduction (I) and a dis cussion of the materials, manufacture and meaning (chapter II), the main corpus of the book is developed in chapter III featuring a commented catalogue of the pieces. The work is closed by an Appendix (IV) where all concordances of the find and in ventory numbers are listed. The artefacts discussed may be attributed chronologically mainly to two periods: the Middle-Assyrian (14th to 12th century BC) and the Neo-Assyrian (9th to 7th century BC) originating both from the palatial and the residential contexts in Assur - in part also from graves. The late 3rd millennium BC and the 1st millennium BC / AD (late Early Dynastic/Akkadian and Post-Assyrian/Parthian) periods are less significantly but nonetheless attested.</page><page sequence="2">Alter Orient und Altes Testament 427 The publication presents the materials according to categories: 1. Figures sculpt ed in the round (including the female figurines from the layer G - late 3rd millenni um BC - of the Ishtar temple, carvings of the Middle and Neo-Assyrian period, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines); 2. Containers and elements of contain ers (including figurative containers, lenticular pyxes, flat containers, straight-walled containers, other elements of containers and non-determined artefacts); 3. Inlays (including figurative pieces such as the famous "VA Ass 981 frieze" as well geomet ric ones); 4. Combs; 5. Jewellery (pendants, beads and rings); 6. Needles, pins and spatulas; 7. Ribbed-Spatulas; 8. Astragalus Bones (knuckle bones); 9. Varia (includ ing seals, writing tablets, fragmentary parts, weapons and parts of tools, decorated hollow bones, disks, (spindle) whorls and buttons, pins and hinges, fragments, frag mentarily manufactured and by-products of manufacture). In a section especially dedicated to this purpose (pp. 61-64), the Author tries to achieve a precise definition of the difference between the terms 'prestige' as opposed to 'luxury', a vocabulary often used in connection with ivory. His effort is to be praised for being very learned. However, one misses the contextualisation of the extremely different examples and references drawn from disciplines as diverse as Malinowski's anthropological observations to Italian baroque. To those one could add archaeological references dealing with the relationship of diverse parts of the society to different types of artefacts and (prestige, luxury or non-luxury) goods, using for example Susan Sherrat's (1999: 185-186) evaluation of elite status as being contextual, i.e., measurable by degrees rather than by a binary yes or no (Whincop 2010: 1005) and developing terminologies such as 'non-elite', 'sub-elites' or 'substi tute-elites'.1 These help in defining much more closely the status of artefacts beyond the simple bulk counts. We feel that comparing ivory's required handicraft skills, attested frequency and distributional patterns with the ones reconstructed for wood does not necessarily point to ivory's non-prestigious status. As is well known from the cuneiform record also (precious, hard) wood was a highly desired commodity, known to have had prestige value for example in Southern Mesopotamia in the third millennium BC or early second millennium Mari. While luxury and prestige are rightly differentiated by the Author as non identical categories they should not be seen as binary (or antithetic) definitions either. In specific instances luxury may have meant prestige, the interpretation in one or the other direction being based on the role played by the single arte fact/material within the entire assemblage. Therefore, it is not clear on which basis some of the grave goods are considered by the Author to have become part of the Sherratt, Susan, 1999: "E pur si muove: pots, markets and values in the second millen nium Mediterranean".

Previous scholarship and acknowledged scientific approaches to the study of funerary contexts (e.g. Parker Pearson 1999)2 would have strengthened the Author's argument on the role and value of specific funerary goods/gifts. For prestige, of course, most relevant is the evaluation of the contextual find sit uation not the find-spot alone. That means, for example, reconstructing which part numerically and typologically of an entire assemblage the examined artefact repre sents. However, our understanding goes to the Author because this is very difficult to discuss in publications organised by "Gattungen" (categories) and not contexts, i.e., where this perspective is programmatically lacking. Precise and reliable material determination of the analysed artefacts, i.e., the dis tinction between elephant ivory and hippopotamus ivory (most likely its cheaper and much more widely available imitation or substitute) is also important in defin ing 'ivory's' luxury status. The publication would have, therefore, gained significant ly in clarity if percentages of material attribution (ivory [hippopotamus or ele phant], antler, bone) for the entire corpus and/or per period and/or find context had been listed in form of tables. As it is, it is not easy to decide which weight to attrib ute to comparisons between (e.g., p. 72) the substantially mono-phase assemblage of bone and ivory finds from Ugarit and the evidence from Assur - bulking together artefacts as disparate as late 3rd millennium (level G Ishtar temple) to Post-Assyrian Parthian period findings. These corpora seem to be very different also because in the instance of Assur only in 63% of the cases a reliable chronological attribution could be assessed and therefore a consistent degree of uncertainty in the classification persists. In fact, the significance and value of ivory and bone in the city of Assur in the two main different epochs represented, i.e., the Middle-Assyrian and the Neo Assyrian periods, need not be either identical in both periods3 nor representative of all other - at time very different - contexts, sites and cities: e.g., Nimrud to Qatna, or Bögazköy to Kujakli. Citations of external references in this book should be read carefully. For "the possibility of 'mobile artisans', who after the collapse of the Late Bronze age palace economies wandered from contractor to contractor offering their services...as al ready formulated by Childe as explanation of the diffusion of technical innovation in European prehistory.." (p. 43) the Author cites Zaccagnini 1983, 257-264. The latter, however, had expressed himself thus: "I want to stress that the passage quoted above [Odyssey 17.382-86] does not offer evidence for wandering craftsmen who constant ly moved from one place to another. I will not touch here on the old, yet still popu lar issue of itinerant artisans in ancient Near Eastern society. In my opinion there is Parker Pearson, Mike, 1999: The Archaeology of Death and Burial. Stroud: Sutton. Gubel, Eric, 2000, Multicultural and multimedial aspects of early Phoenician art, c. 1200-675 BCE, in C.Uelinger (ed.), Images as Media Sources for the cultural history of the Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean (1st millennium BCE), OBO 175, Fribourg, 185-214, p. 186 and Luciani, Marta, 2006a: "Ivoty at Qatna", in E.

To hypothesize a significant pres ence of itinerant craftsmen in the Near East and to link these movements of 'free' artisans with the spread of fundamental technologies (e.g., iron metallurgy) seems a serious historical mistake" (Zaccagnini 1983: 258).4 As the Author later writes, Zac cagnini (ibid.) and Liverani (1990)5 refer to "exchange" of artisans, the latter author defining it a form of "exchange of prestige goods" in the context of the Late Bronze palatial society. So the reader not well acquainted with the discussion may wonder why Zaccagnini and Liverani are cited to claim that "in view of the limited number of tools of the trade needed by ivory carvers [Childe's idea/thesis] is not unground ed" (p. 43). Also the statement seemingly pointing out that the evidence of Qatna's 'Lower City Palace' refers "mostly to deer antler" (p. 65) is puzzling since as clearly reada ble in publications cited by the Author himself6 (p. 39) only less than 30% of the corpus is made of deer antler and 70% of elephant ivory. And the precise corre spondence of inlay shapes with different materials as well as their selective distribu tion in the two different rooms of the 'Lower City Palace'7 all point to a non interchangeability of different materials (deer antler as opposed to ivory)8. The remarks above just stand to prove how many interesting themes may be ad dressed starting from the study here under review. The typology of this comprehensive and very thorough publication is well ordered, easy to use and to refer to for the reader.

A definition of this ca. 2,500 square meter building with over 65 rooms, featuring a clear 'reception suite' typical of throne-and-banquet halls of Levantine palaces as well as basalt orthostats and column bases, terrazzo floors and wall paintings, both of monochrome and of polychrome "Aegeanising" type, Aegean Rhyta and Cypriote pot tery, more than 50 cuneiform tablets, seal impressions and sealings, etc., as a "Hand werksareal" and not a palace (p. 39 fn. 33) seems to ignore the published evidence (Luciani 2005, 2006a and 2006b, Pfälzner 2006-2008). That - as in the case of the Ras Ibn Hani palace - some rooms may have been used as (primary or secondary) workshops, during or after the main use of the building does not immediately make the entire edifice a "Handwerksareal" but can be easily explained by the characteristic variety of activities traditionally localised in palatial buildings (Luciani 2006b).
