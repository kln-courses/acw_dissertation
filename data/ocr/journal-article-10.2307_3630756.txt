Santley Department of Anthropology, MSC 01-1040, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 Review of The Maya and Teotihuacan: Reinterpreting Early Classic Interaction, edited by Geoffrey E. Braswell. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003, xviii + 423 pp. $40.00, cloth; $24.95, paper. Since the 1930s, archaeologists have discovered startling evidence of cultural interaction between the Early Classic Maya and the great Central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. This book reports on these findings on a case-by-case basis and offers new interpretations concerning the range of those interactions. My review of this work is in two parts. First, I summarize the results reported. I then compare them with recent findings from Matacapan, a site in southern Veracruz long known to have been in contact with Teotihuacan. FROM A.C. 400 UNTIL 700, Teotihuacan was one of the largest and most important cites in North America. At the same time, it was also able to exert widespread "influence" throughout Mesoamerica. By influence is meant the occurrence of Teotihuacan-style architecture, sculpture, and portable artifacts at archaeological sites beyond the boundaries of the core Teotihuacan polity. Unraveling the character of and the reasons behind the interaction between the Maya of eastern Mesoamerica and the great Central Mexican metropolis is the subject of this book. This topic is often mentioned in the Maya archaeological literature, but until now it has not been considered in any great detail in a single volume. THE VIEW FROM THE MAYA REGION The contributors to this volume deal with a number of related issues, including the reasons for Teotihuacan involvement in different parts of the Maya area, variation in the amount and kind of interaction between the Maya and Teotihuacan, the changing character of this interaction through time and across space, and the decline of contacts with Teotihuacan. The book is organized on a case-by-case basis. The case examples come primarily from two geographic areas: highland Guatemala and Honduras and the southern Maya lowlands (Figure 1). Each study summarizes the results of a long-term research effort at a different archaeological site or region. In some cases, because of the great volume of evidence, the same site is dealt with in several chapters.

According to Braswell, the earliest models were mainly Teotihuacan-centric, with the Maya viewed as passive recipients of ideas developed originally in the Central Mexican highlands and the Maya "state" and "civilization" viewed as largely Teotihuacan- derived phenomena. Later scholars adopted an internalist perspective on the development of complexity in the Maya region. For the internalists, complex society development among the ancient Maya was not the result of Teotihuacan conquest or the diffusion of great ideas from the city; rather, Maya polities and their governing elites were major active participants in the process leading to the rise of complex society. More recently, archaeologists have argued for the abandonment of approaches that subscribe to the intemalist/externalist dichotomy. They contend that a better approach is one that views the process as the result of a variety of factors, some internal and others external. In addition, they argue that there may be variability from site to site and through time. Braswell feels that the externalist perspective is better suited for describing the early part of the process, whereas internalist models may provide a more adequate characterization for the later part of the sequence. In Chapter 2, Frederick Bove and Sonia Medrano Busto offer the first substantive case concerning contacts with Teotihuacan. Their focus is the south Pacific coast of Guatemala, in particular the region near the modern city of Escuintla. According to them, Teotihuacan interaction had two pulses. During the earlier Terminal Preclassic-Early Classic transition (A.C. 200-250), Teotihuacan materials are confined primarily to the site of Balberta. This assemblage consists mainly of cached ceramic vessels containing effigy cacao beans, Thin Orange pottery, and green obsidian from the Pachuca source in Central Mexico. Also present is obsidian from the Zaragoza source in Puebla, Mexico. This material suggests links with Central Mexico and possibly the south Gulf Coast of Mexico, but not the presence of a Teotihuacan enclave or a military colony. The Early Classic (A.C. 400-550) situation was entirely different. A new capital was established in the region at the site of Montana. Evidence of contacts with Teotihuacan is present on a number of levels. First, the Teotihuacan-inspired portable technology continues; however, it is now more diverse, containing the artifacts described earlier but also candeleros, warrior figurines, cylindrical tripod vases, and censers. Most of this material is found in domestic contexts, implying use in household rituals. Second, the orientation of the major mounds at Montana is 10-20 degrees east of north, an axis prevalent at Teotihuacan, and many mounds are large enough to have supported households who may have lived in Teotihuacan-style apartment complexes. No talud-tablero platform facades have been reported to date. For Bove and Medrano Busto, this evidence indicates that Montana and other sites nearby were physically conquered by Teotihuacan, likely in order to control the region's rich local resource base. Chapters 3 and 4, both by Geoffrey Braswell, reinterpret the archaeological record from Kaminaljuyu, a site long believed also to have been conquered by</page><page sequence="4">382 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Teotihuacan and to have supported a Teotihuacan enclave. These chapters focus on the contextual information for Central Mexican architecture and ceramics from different spatial and temporal locations at the site. The chronometric dates suggest that the Teotihuacan-style ceramics and talud-tablero architecture are not coterminous; rather, the pottery precedes the buildings and is largely known from burials and not household middens. Although green obsidian from Pachuca is fairly common in burials, it does not occur there very often in the form of fine prismatic blades, the primary object made at and exported from Teotihuacan. Braswell believes that this is not the kind of evidence one would expect if Kaminaljuyu had been conquered and colonized by Teotihuacan. In addition, he feels that it is not in keeping with models that posit Teotihuacan long-distance merchants, ports-of-trade, economic imperialism, or elite gift giving as major components describing the interaction between Central Mexico and the Valley of Guatemala. How then can we explain the presence of Teotihuacan-style pottery at sites like Kaminaljuyu? Since most of this assemblage consists of locally made copies of Central Mexican originals, imports from Teotihuacan are uncommon. Following Mayanist Joseph Ball's (1983) argument, the Maya elite manipulated exotic goods and symbols to reinforce their status vis-a-vis commoners and other elites. In some instances foreign goods met this requirement, but in others imitations of them were sufficient. In Chapter 5, Robert Sharer examines how Teotihuacan connections were used to solidify major dynastic founding events at Copan. Of particular importance are the reigns of the dynastic founder, K'inich Yaax K'uk' Mo', and his son and successor, K'inich Popol Hol, who ruled collectively from A.C. 426/427 until 472. This chapter is based on historical information from carved monuments and archaeological evidence on architectural history obtained from the excavation of three kilometers of tunnels under Copan's Central Acropolis. The dynastic founder was laid to rest under the Hunal building, a platform constructed in Central Mexican talud-tablero style. The arrival of this ruler, who was not native to Teotihuacan but likely from the southern Maya lowlands, coincided with his overthrow of the established monarch, his marriage to a royal woman from the previous ruling family, and the construction of a new royal center which involved both the public and private use of symbols of political and supernatural power derived from Teotihuacan. His son later promoted K'inich Yaax K'uk' Mo' as the founder of a new Copan dynasty but also accentuated his own authority by emphasizing his lowland Maya connections in his architecture, monuments, and textual inscriptions. Later monarchs at Copan continued K'inich Popol Hol's method of legitimization. The following three chapters discuss the archaeological record at Tikal. In Chapter 6, Maria Josefa Iglesias Ponce de Leon discusses "problematical" deposits at this archaeological site. A problematical deposit is a feature such as a pit that was intentionally constructed and then filled with household trash and other archaeological materials. Although these features occur in a variety of contexts, rarely do they contain much material of Teotihuacan origin or derivation, indicating that contacts with that city have been greatly overplayed by many</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 383 writers. In Chapter 7, Juan Pedro Laporte reviews the architectural evidence for contacts with Central Mexico. Specifically, he looks at the presence and distribution of talud-tablero platforms and Teotihuacan-style apartment complexes at the site. Laporte points out that the talud-tablero architecture at Tikal and other Maya centers predates buildings constructed in the same style at Teotihuacan, suggesting that this architectural element was widely distributed in Mesoamerica before it was in common usage in Central Mexico and that the structures called apartment complexes probably had some nonresidential function. In Chapter, 8 James Borowicz examines yet another subject matter: the various programs of iconographic representation on carved monuments and their relationship to Teotihuacan. The mode of representation reflects the nature of Maya rulership. At the beginning of the Early Classic period (ca. A.C. 250-378), Maya sovereigns were depicted on stelae in various ceremonial, ritual, and military contexts, and references to Teotihuacan were kept to a minimum. In the Maya highlands, Pacific Coast, and Valley of Oaxaca, monarchs were represented in this fashion as early as the Late Formative period (ca. 300 B.c.). The earliest monarchs at Tikal, therefore, emphasized the previous order of legitimization to the right to reign common elsewhere in the Maya region. With the ascent of Yaax Nu'n Ahyiin (Curl Nose) to the throne in A.C. 378/379, the method of legitimization changed. Although military themes were still frequently mentioned on his monuments, powerful foreign connections with the city of Teotihuacan were now emphasized. According to Borowicz, this shift in focus signifies a new way of substantiating the ruler's position of primacy in his quest for power. Whether Yaax Nu'n Ahyiin was physically a Teotihuacano or a Maya of elite standing with close ties to the very influential foreign power is still a matter of some debate. A third mode of legitimization, a variation of the first program, was initiated during the reign of his son, Siyaj Chan K'awiil (Stormy Sky), modified slightly by his grandson, K'an Ak (Kan Boar), and maintained by subsequent rulers. "The ... return to the initial program seems to indicate the fleeting nature of interaction with Teotihuacan during Yaax N'un Ahyiin's reign. The third iconographic program ... also reflects the inability of previous programs to meet the needs of a ruler in a new political environment. During his reign, military imagery and ancestor veneration were suppressed in favor of depictions of rituals related to the passage of time" (p. 233). The final five chapters are more eclectic in their orientation. Chapter 9 by David Pendergast looks at the archaeological evidence for Teotihuacan interaction from Tomb F-8/1 at Altun Ha in Belize. Although few artifacts of Teotihuacan origin or derivation occur at the site, Tomb F-8/1 contains considerable evidence of ties with Central Mexico. Much of the obsidian assemblage appears to derive from Central Mexico, although the ceramics were locally manufactured, even though some are copies of Teotihuacan vessels such as cylindrical tripod vases and cups with annular bases. The obsidian material seems to represent a specific import event related to a particular elite personage, the impact of which had only nominal long-term consequences, to judge from the very limited quantities of Teotihuacan obsidian in later deposits.</page><page sequence="6">384 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH In Chapter 10, Carmen Varela Torrecilla and Geoffrey Braswell describe the presence of Teotihuacan-style architecture and artifacts at the site of Oxkintok in the northern Maya lowlands. For them, these materials reflect participation in a pan-Mesoamerican interaction network coeval with the establishment of state- level society at the site, not the founding of an enclave from Teotihuacan. All of the case examples described thus far recount the impact of Teotihuacan at Maya sites. In Chapter 11, Karl Taube examines the archaeological record for Maya-Teotihuacan interaction in Central Mexico, using the mural paintings and ceramics from the Tetitla apartment complex at Teotihuacan. The murals depict supernaturals such as the Bearded Dragon, a creator deity known as Pawahtun, and the Tonsured Maize God. Also shown are phonetic Maya texts. Some of these are Teotihuacan-style passages that "appear as massive emblematic glyphs" (p. 311). These glyphs are also depicted on utilitarian pottery. The varied themes on the ceramics and in the paintings found in the compound suggest to Taube that Tetitla was an "international house," occupied perhaps by Maya merchants or shell procurers. The Tetitla apartment complex is one of the finest known from Teotihuacan, implying interaction between the two regions on the elite or palace level. The final two chapters are synthetic views from the outside: a counterpoint that involves generalist non-Mayanist perspectives on Teotihuacan-Maya interaction. In Chapter 12, George Cowgill offers a perspective from Teotihuacan. In his view, Teotihuacan-Maya interaction occurred in four phases. Before A.C. 200, diverse regions of Mesoamerica began interacting with Teotihuacan, a process that may be seen in ceramic homologies and imported obsidian. Between A.C. 200 and 350, the interaction begun earlier seems to have continued and intensified. Cowgill feels that Teotihuacan was now interested in cultivating individual Maya potentates as trading partners in order to gain access to tropical rainforest resources, perhaps using lowland Gulf Coast polities as intermediaries. The A.C. 300-450/500 time frame was a period of widespread intensive interaction involving some conquest and intervention by Teotihuacan but mainly dealings between political equals in both directions. The earlier part of this interaction may have involved a fleeting attempt by Teotihuacan to establish a far-flung but unstable empire. The nature and effects of this dual-directional interaction were probably highly variable. After A.C. 450/500, interaction began to wane. For Cowgill, the pattern was one of even greater deviations from Central Mexican practices than before. It is also during this phase when Maya texts from a number of sites indicate that elites made the most references to Teotihuacan, a pattern that more likely reflects connections to a distant past than bona fide political reality in Teotihuacan's last years. The book closes with Chapter 13 by Joyce Marcus. She argues that no single model seems to account for all Maya sites and that there was likely considerable variation in the nature of Teotihuacan-Maya interaction through time. Moreover, influence was probably not unilateral; rather, interaction between the Maya and Teotihuacan was bidirectional. Four general models are proposed as likely candidates describing the interrelationship: single-event interaction, multistage</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 385 interaction, simple dyadic interaction, and numerous interactions mediated by multiple sites. Marcus believes that several of these models were in operation simultaneously. Single-event interaction describes the situation at Altun Ha and Becan, whereas multistage interaction appears to have been the case at Copan, Tikal, and Kaminaljuyu. It should be apparent that I think that this is a very important book. All of the articles are of high quality, and much of the information is new. It likely will become a standard reference in Mesoamerican archaeology and more broadly in the study of complex society. However, a number of issues critical to the subject of Teotihuacan-Maya interaction are not addressed in the book. For example, with the exception of the chapters by Marcus, Sharer, and Borowicz, the various contributors make no attempt to address the character of the interaction in a systematic way. Are we dealing with single versus multiple interactions; short- versus long-term interaction; simple dyadic family versus group interaction; political, commercial, or religious interaction; symmetrical versus asymmetrical interaction; or unidirectional, dual-directional, or multidirectional interaction? Is there any patterning in the nature of interaction across the landscape and is there variation given the classes of cultural systems interacting? What changes in interaction type, if any, occurred through time, and is there any patterning in the sequence of change across space and by system class? THE VIEW FROM MATACAPAN I have been grappling with these questions at Matacapan, a large Classic period center in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico (Figure 2) (Ortiz and Santley 1998; Santley 1989; Santley and Arnold 2000; Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987). Although Matacapan was initially occupied in the Early Formative period (1400-1000 B.c.), it was later abandoned and then reoccupied in the Middle Classic (A.C. 450-650). The main zone of Classic period occupation covers 10.37 km2, but the area of higher density refuse accumulation is much smaller in size, 3.61 km2 (see Figure 2). Matacapan is situated in the most productive agricultural subregion today, which probably also accounts for its large size in the Middle Classic. A large central plaza, a complex of mounded architecture, and other archaeological features dominate downtown Matacapan. Two types of structures are present: low rectangular mounds, which probably were platforms that supported residences, and tall conical mounds that originally were the multistage bases for temples. The two largest residential platforms may have been the residences of the rulers of Matacapan, and each is paired with a temple, which is in all likelihood also a burial mound. Other platforms and temple mounds occur, and sometimes these are arranged around small secondary plazas. One of these groups, the Teotihuacan Barrio, has temple architecture that was built in talud-tablero style. Scatters of surface pottery cover the remainder of the site. Sometimes these scatters are associated with other platform mounds, but in many other cases they are not, probably because of their leveling by modern plowing.</page><page sequence="8">386 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH AMERICAN SOUTHWEST C ARI B N S.GULF OF CARIEO ANF SA.MEXICO MEXICO { XC TIN ELTAJI.OXKI ' M.'

The Tuxtlas region showing major archaeological sites A Teotihuacan "presence" at the site is indicated by several lines of evidence, including portable artifacts and civic-ceremonial and residential architecture, The architectural evidence is concentrated in the central part of the site, but Teotihuacan-style artifacts occur throughout Matacapan and are marked in their diversity. The Teotihuacan-style architecture consists of at least one talud-tablero platform and a series of substantial platforms that apparently supported large multiple-roomed residences with room groups interconnected by intervening corridors. Teotihuacan residential architectural hallmarks at Matacapan include the apartment complex plan, building orientation approximately 15.5 degrees east of north, and internment under the corners of rooms. Burials were often accompanied by bowls, plates, and tripod vases produced in Fine Buff, a local imitation of Copa Ware, a common ceramic type at Teotihuacan. These vessels are frequently represented in the burial assemblage, even during time periods when they are not prevalent in domestic middens. The temple platforms of Mound 2 were built using the talud-tablero format, but the talud-tablero ratio is about 1:1, which is not within the range of from 1:6 to 1:2.5 that is more common at Teotihuacan. Mound 2's orientation is also about 15 degrees east of north, and the presence of similarly sized temple platforms in central Matacapan suggests that other buildings were constructed using the same design.</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 387 Many classes of portable artifacts at Matacapan were apparently inspired or influenced by Teotihuacan originals. Included here are cylindrical tripod vessels with hollow cutout supports, which compare favorably with similar types at Teotihuacan; floreros (often with small nubbin supports); single- and double- chambered candeleros; Thin Orange bowls; braceros with anthropomorphic rims; solid mold-made figurines with rectangular heads and elaborate headdresses; metates having talud-tablero tripod supports; Teotihuacan-style incensarios; and green obsidian from Pachuca (Figure 3). Except for the Pachuca obsidian, most of these materials were produced locally and are not imports from Teotihuacan or Central Mexico. These materials have been recovered from middens in and around elite residential mounds (Mounds 3, 18, and 22), nonelite contexts (Mound 61), and specialized ceramics production areas (Mound 61, Area 138, and Comoapan); in other words, these artifacts have been found in every part of the site we have intensively investigated to date. Originally, I had thought that these materials were confined to the Teotihuacan Barrio, that part of the site where Mound 2 is located. We now know that they occur not only throughout Matacapan but also at many smaller sites in the countryside around the main center. The presence of this portable technology suggests activities associated with ritual and food preparation and consumption. To judge from the frequency of these materials, these activities were not very commonplace; that is, most ritual and ceramic vessel use involved types produced in local style. The Teotihuacan-style assemblage, however, is consistently present in the complex of archaeological material at Matacapan. This assemblage implies the presence of foreigners from Teotihuacan who resided at Matacapan but who commonly used artifacts made in local style. It is also possible that this presence involved persons who merely claimed to be Teotihuacanos but who were ethnically local Tuxtlecos. If there were persons from Teotihuacan, this outsider presence may have involved only adult males, but females from Central Mexico may have also been present at the beginning of the Classic period. Future phosphate oxygen-isotope analysis of the skeletal remains should resolve this issue. The talud-tablero platforms indicate the presence of temples erected in Teotihuacan style. This architecture occurs in downtown Matacapan not far from the Main Plaza, the site's principal political, religious, and economic facility. I believe that buildings such as Mound 1 and Mound 2, structures that were constructed in foreign style, reflect the existence of an important central institution that emphasized Matacapan's ethnic ancestry and the site's important later foreign ties. This, combined with the presence of persons who used Teotihuacan-style culinary and ritual artifacts, suggests that foreigners from Central Mexico established Matacapan as an enclave sometime during the Early Classic period. Abner Cohen (1969) has observed this enclave-founding process in Yoruba towns in detail, and my perusal of the ethnographic record suggests that foreigner ethnic identity is often expressed in community-wide religious institutions and on the household level in behavior associated with personal ideology and dietary habits (Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987).</page><page sequence="10">388 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Mound 2 Figurines Figurines 'ViV QD Gr cD Ecc Tts) Tripod Supports Tripod Vessels Candeleros Figure 3. Teotihuacan-style materials from Matacapan</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 389 This influence continued for several centuries afterwards, and some of it was still present following the decline of Teotihuacan as a center of macroregional or global import. The fact that the incidence of Teotihuacan influence at Matacapan corresponds with increases in the amount of obsidian imported shows that greater access to long-distance exchange networks was an important byproduct of the contact and enclave establishment process in southern Veracruz. Matacapan was a very powerful Middle Classic site, exercising firm control over the Tuxtlas and areas beyond. Except for the site of Montana on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, no Maya site seems to have supported an enclave of comparable scale and duration. The Maya data indicate that contacts with Central Mexico were generally short- term and often confined to interrelations between elite personages. Some of these interactions were very likely real, while others were probably contrived or entirely fictive. Teotihuacan-style materials also occur at other sites in the Tuxtlas. In the late Early Classic (A.C. 300-450), candeleros and vessels with hollow tripod supports occur at only three sites besides Matacapan, and these are all located near that main center (Santley and Arnold 1996). The number of other sites with these materials rises to eleven in the early Middle Classic (A.C. 450-550). These settlements include both large and small centers as well as smaller villages and hamlets, and they occur throughout the Tuxtlas, not simply in the area around Matacapan (Santley and Arnold 1996). These data indicate a greater penetration of the Teotihuacan lifestyle into the countryside than we previously thought (Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987). The pattern in late Middle Classic times (A.C. 550- 650) is very much the same, though the number of sites with this material drops to nine. A major falloff occurs in the early Late Classic (A.C. 650-800); only two sites besides Matacapan have Teotihuacan-style material, and both are situated close to the top-ranking center, indicating a major contraction in Teotihuacan influence regionally, despite the fact that many sites were still occupied throughout the area. This pattern dovetails nicely with the temporal trend in the frequency of these materials at Matacapan. Teotihuacan-style materials disappear entirely in the succeeding late Late Classic period (A.C. 800-1000). Does this patterning in the amount of Teotihuacan influence at Matacapan have any correspondences with the volume of lithic material imported to the Tuxtlas via long-distance exchange? I have argued that Teotihuacan, heading a cartel of producers, was the principal conveyor of obsidian goods long distances during the Middle Classic (Santley 1983). Obsidian comprises the vast majority of all lithics used in the Tuxtlas prehistorically, and because the nearest sources upon which the region relied are more than 250 km distant, all of this trade was long- distance. Most of the obsidian used in the Tuxtlas came from the Zaragoza source near the border between central Veracruz and Puebla, but some also was imported from deposits directly dominated by the Teotihuacan polity, particularly green obsidian from the Pachuca source in Hidalgo (Santley et al. 2001). Substantial quantities of obsidian were channeled to the Tuxtlas in the Classic period. The total amount of obsidian imported was only about 217 kg per year in the late Early Classic; however, the volume of import later increased to 7.6 and then</page><page sequence="12">390 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 19.7 metric tons in the Middle Classic, followed by a decline to 7.6 metric tons in the early Late Classic (Santley and Arnold 2000). At its peak, this trade annually would have required the services of nearly eight hundred burden-bearers, assuming that each carried a load of 25 kg. These changes in consumption were primarily a function of two factors: variation in the number of consumers and differences in the per capita rate of usage, both of which increased from Early to Middle Classic times and then declined in the Late Classic. The annual total amount imported was simply the product of the annual weight of obsidian used per capita times the population per phase times the average weight of the blades discarded away from residential sites (see Santley, Kneebone, and Kerley 1985, Santley and Arnold 2000, and Santley and Barrett 2002 for a fuller explanation of the procedures behind these estimates). The incidence of green obsidian consumption through time patterns similarly, although the totals are far lower. Most of this obsidian was exchanged as prepared macro cores, but some was traded as blocks, fully processed polyhedral cores, and sometimes prismatic blades. Many of the cores were likely distributed through the main market at Matacapan before dissemination to households for manufacture into tools. We do not know who was physically responsible for this long-distance trade; however, because its incidence corresponds with the amount of Teotihuacan influence at Matacapan and other sites in the Tuxtlas, I suspect that its exchange was actually managed by Teotihuacanos, their agents, or other persons claiming close Teotihuacan affiliations. The distribution of green obsidian from the Pachuca source provides additional information on the pattern of Teotihuacan influence in time and space. The general pattern follows that for Zaragoza obsidian from central Veracruz, but the amounts consumed annually in the Tuxtlas were much smaller. In the late Early Classic, only 12 kg of green obsidian were imported to the Tuxtlas. The annual total later increased dramatically to 464 kg and then to 2.6 metric tons in the Middle Classic. This increase was followed by a great decline to only 45 kg per year in the early Late Classic. Most of this obsidian entered the Tuxtlas as prismatic blades, a very energetically inefficient trading strategy given the costs involved in moving basic goods long distances using foot transport, but some of the trade also involved fully prepared polyhedral cores. During the Middle Classic period, green obsidian accounts for 13 percent of all material; however, in the central part of the site it comprises 46 percent of the assemblage from high-status contexts. The incidence of this material decreases substantially with distance from the Main Plaza. Persons of lower rank at Matacapan therefore appear to have had access to significantly smaller quantities of obsidian from Central Mexico. The frequency of Pachuca obsidian at other large centers such as Teotepec is about the same. Small centers consumed only about half as much green material as large centers, with small sites (villages and hamlets) having even less of this obsidian. The amount of green obsidian consumed thus appears to have been a function of social status, as well as of the political position of sites in the regional settlement hierarchy. Green obsidian is also present in neighboring areas such as La Mixtequilla and the Hueyapan region, but it rarely comprises much more than 2 percent of the Middle Classic</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 391 assemblages there. La Mixtequilla and the Hueyapan region are areas where Teotihuacan-style artifacts also occur, but not to the same extent or frequency as at Matacapan. The spatial distribution of green obsidian from the south Gulf Coast of Veracruz would consequently appear to have been very Tuxtlas-centric, a focus that accords well with the evidence available for Teotihuacan influence in the same regions. IMPLICATIONS What does this patterning mean as far as Teotihuacan influence on the south Gulf Coast is concerned? First, the evidence at hand indicates that Matacapan supported a Teotihuacan enclave. That enclave was established in the late Early Classic and endured well into the eighth century A.C. Enclave identification is suggested by the presence of Teotihuacan-style temple architecture in the downtown part of the site, indicating a central institution with Teotihuacan associations, and portable ritual-ceremonial and food preparation and consumption gear, most of which was locally produced. At its beginning, the enclave probably involved a founding population of both adult males and females, perhaps supplemented with some children, which was set up at Matacapan, located in a previously largely unoccupied part of the Tuxtlas. Following its establishment, the population of the region increased from about 1,700 to around 53,000, suggesting that the enclave attracted literally tens of thousands of immigrants (Santley and Arnold 1996). Many of these immigrants likely came from the south Gulf Coast, but some of them may have come from Central Mexico and perhaps even from Teotihuacan. The reasons for the establishment of an enclave were probably economic. Matacapan is situated near high-quality sources of igneous rock for manos and metates that were widely traded in southern Veracruz. The surrounding region also contains large deposits of ceramic clays that were used in substantial quantities for fine-paste pottery. This pottery was manufactured in a large-scale and internally differentiated ceramics production industry, and it was distributed to neighboring areas such as La Mixtequilla and the Hueyapan region as well as Teotihuacan, Oaxaca, and perhaps the Maya region. Many late Middle and early Late Classic ceramic figurines show females involved in cotton textile production. These goods, too, may have been channeled into the export market. Finally, Matacapan is located equidistant between Central Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula and could have functioned as a convenient stopover and provisioning point for caravans hauling goods overland to and from both regions. At the time of the enclave establishment, its inhabitants used comparatively few Teotihuacan-style artifacts. These materials increased substantially in quantity as the site and regional population grew in size but later decreased greatly as Teotihuacan's political and economic status in Mesoamerica waned. Teotihuacan probably was not as interested in adjacent areas like La Mixtequilla and the Hueyapan region because they contained few resources to which Teotihuacan merchants wanted access in quantity.</page><page sequence="14">392 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The Teotihuacan presence in the Tuxtlas apparently required large quantities of obsidian to meet its domestic needs. The specific uses of this material are unknown at present. Some of the assemblage consists of prismatic blades that have heavy use-wear, but other blades display no or very limited edge damage. Obsidian was therefore probably used for a variety of heavy-duty cutting activities such as hide scraping, as well as for a number of fine-cutting tasks like butchering wild game and auto-sacrifice. Because many of the tools produced by the stone knappers are missing (i.e., they are not present in the assemblages from domestic household contexts), they were likely used in association with activities conducted off-site (Santley and Barrett 2002). This off-site assemblage may have amounted to 85 percent or more of all of the tools used. Therefore, a very low-density scatter of spent tools and evidence of their production and resharpening likely surround archaeological residential sites. Green obsidian from Central Mexico loomed prominently in the Tuxtlas' lithic economy. As noted above, its frequency of occurrence was status-dependent, with elites at Matacapan receiving much more of this material than persons of lower status. Matacapan, in turn, used more green obsidian than small centers during the Middle Classic, with farmers living in small villages and hamlets getting the smallest proportion of all. I do not know the behavioral significance of this fact, but it may have something to do with the Teotihuacan elite at Matacapan reinforcing their ethnic identity through a medium that was genuinely from Central Mexico. For example, elite bloodletting and human sacrifice may have required Teotihuacan originals for successful ceremony completion, not substitutes produced in other obsidians or lithic media. In turn, the presence of the same material in lower-status contexts at Matacapan and at other sites throughout the Tuxtlas may reflect gift giving by the top-ranking elite to solidify political and social linkages aimed at greater inclusion of the non-Central Mexican Tuxtleco population in the Teotihuacan "world." The total amount of green obsidian present increased as other Teotihuacan-style materials rose in quantity, but it dropped significantly as Teotihuacan lost its political clout and no longer was the preeminent economic power in Mesoamerica during the Late Classic period. The observations on obsidian assemblage composition just presented pertain to Teotihuacan "identities": that is, objects produced in and later imported from the city (Ball 1983). This conclusion is possible because the point of origin of obsidian has been established by chemical analysis. Archaeological analysis is much more difficult when we are dealing with "homologies": that is, local copies of foreign originals. In Mesoamerica, foreign stylistic affiliation is generally established using the following diffusionist conventions: the criterion of temporal priority, the criterion of numeric abundance, and the criterion of physical likeness. Much of the research that I have conducted at Matacapan is based on these assumptions, and so is that by other archaeologists elsewhere in Mesoamerica. The criterion of temporal priority submits that the location where a trait was first developed is its place of origin. It was generally held that talud-tablero platforms were first found in the Basin of Mexico, probably at Teotihuacan or one of its immediate dependencies; therefore, they were probably originally invented</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 393 there, very likely at Teotihuacan. It is now apparent, however, that this type of platform occurs earlier in Puebla and in the Maya lowlands, as several contributors in The Maya and Teotihuacan point out. The criterion of numeric abundance rests on the assumption that the location where a trait is the most common is likely the place of original development. For example, archaeologists have contended that the cylindrical tripod vessel is a Teotihuacan hallmark because more vessels of this type occur at the city and at sites in its immediate countryside than elsewhere in Mesoamerica. However, several archaeologists writing in The Maya and Teotihuacan have recently shown that these vessels are also very common in southern Veracruz and Tabasco, where they actually may occur earlier than comparable vessels in Central Mexico. Finally, the criterion of physical likeness stipulates that an observed similarity between two objects is in fact real. For example, everyone agrees that a talud- tablero platform has a sloping batter at the base with a rectangular panel placed on top and that it a characteristic of Teotihuacan architecture, but how do we know that this form is distinctively associated with Teotihuacan? As several of the authors in The Maya and Teotihuacan lament, the talud-tablero ratio at Middle Classic sites in Mesoamerica varies considerably, even at its presumed place of origin, Teotihuacan. Archaeologists often invoke the criteria of temporal priority and numeric abundance as bases for specifying the point of origin for material goods. Where they run into trouble is with the criterion of physical likeness. For example, the cylindrical tripod bowl with hollow tripod feet is generally considered a Teotihuacan diagnostic, developed and used in the city in great numbers in the Middle Classic. Many of these vessels have cutout feet showing the stylized face of the deity Tlaloc. These vessels were produced in a number of wares, and their form is typically squat: that is, they are wider than tall. Frequently as well, they are highly decorated, incised with human figures or covered with anthropomorphic fresco paintings produced in Central Mexican style. Friezes of small appliqu6 faces at the base of the exterior wall are also commonplace. A large number of similar vessels have been found in burials at the Mound A-B temple complex at the Maya site of Kaminaljuyu in highland Guatemala. These vessels also have tripod supports, but in form they are tall thin vessels, not the short squat bowls so common at Teotihuacan. This vaselike shape is widely distributed in the Maya region, but not at Teotihuacan. Moreover, many of the Kaminaljuyu vessels are decorated with paintings of personages rendered in Maya style. The cylindrical tripod vessels from Matacapan are different still. These vessels were generally produced in Fine Buff, a local imitation of Teotihuacan Copa Ware. The vessels have a height-to-width ratio close to 1:1; however, their walls are usually undecorated. Many have cutout supports, sometimes with stylized faces of Tlaloc, but their distal ends are tapered, not quadrangular as they are at Teotihuacan. All of these vessels are said to have been produced in Teotihuacan style, be they from Central Mexico or elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Clearly there is a problem here, and the problem is that the term "Teotihuacan style" incorporates a significant amount of formal variation. The same is true for the talud-tablero facade of platforms. When scholars</page><page sequence="16">394 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH think of a talud-tablero facade, they visualize an architectural form with a sloping base, the talud, and a rectangular panel, the tablero, built on top. The front of the platform has two of these elements, as a frontal stairway flanked by balustrades runs up the center of the platform. Sometimes the interior of the tablero is painted or covered with sculpture, but it may be left undecorated. There also is considerable variability in the height of the talud relative to the tablero: the talud-tablero ratio. To many archaeologists, the 1:1 ratio appears to be the preferred form. It is not, however, for at Teotihuacan there is no single statistic; rather, the ratio ranges from 1:1.3 to 1:2.5, but values as low as 1:1.3 have been reported. At Matacapan and Kaminaljuyu, the ratio averages around 1:1; Tikal has ratios from 1:1 to 1:2, with one example of 2:1; the ratio at Tepeapulco is 1:1.3; the Copan ratio is 1:2.7; and the Oxkintok and Dzibilchaltun ratios range from 1:1.2 to 1:2.5. Obviously this ratio varies greatly, even at Teotihuacan, the presumed place of origin of the style. As George Cowgill points out in his chapter, some of this variation is due to floor resurfacing in front of the platform, which reduces the height of the talud. In other instances, the variation may be due to engineering concerns; that is, certain types of underlying fill may not support a very tall tablero. In other cases, it may be wholly stylistic. It should be apparent that again there is a problem, and that problem is that we do not know whether a talud-tablero building is Teotihuacan in origin, derivation, or inspiration. When the subject matter involves identities, stylistic similarity is not a major concern because point of origin can be generally established unambiguously, in the case of obsidian by using some form of chemical analysis (e.g., INAA, or Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis). On the other hand, claims of a stylistic sort that involve homologies cannot be evaluated in this way. One possible solution to the problem with homologies is to prepare tabulations of the materials possibly indicative of Teotihuacan influence on site-to-site and subsite-to-subsite bases. This is the tactic that I adopted when I initially considered Teotihuacan influence and the obsidian trade on the Mesoamerican level. Here I defined three classes of influence-enclaves, interactive nodes, and receiver nodes-looking at Teotihuacan-style architecture, sculpture, and artifacts. This approach does not remedy the stylistic dilemma just discussed, but it does provide a starting point for quantitative analysis. Related to the problem of stylistic variability is a process that Abner Cohen (1969) calls homogenization. This is a process that often occurs in enclaves when the inhabitants come from different parts of a homeland where customs vary. With homogenization, variation is minimized, and similarities from all parts of the homeland are emphasized. Technically, then, the style of homeland materials might be different from that of the enclave or in other types of situations where there are foreign presences or outsider influence is involved. The study of quantitative variables such as the talud-tablero ratio and the height-to-width ratio of cylindrical tripod vessels from site to site or subsite to subsite might be very useful in this regard. Another valuable kind of research would involve the systematic study of human skeletons from Maya sites exhibiting Teotihuacan influence using oxygen-</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW ARTICLE: TEOTIHUACAN IN THE MAYA REGION 395 isotope or strontium-isotope analysis to pinpoint whether foreigners are present, their social and economic status, and their place of origin (White et al. 2000). A final kind of inquiry would be work of the type we have conducted on obsidian in the Tuxtlas in conjunction with the types of studies other archaeologists have undertaken. An aspect of this research might involve a focus on so-called foreign pottery whose place of manufacture can also be established by mineralogical and trace element analyses. From reading The Maya and Teotihuacan, it appears that the kinds of research just described are not commonly undertaken in Mesoamerica. I am confident, however, that they will become major new lines of inquiry in the not too distant future. REFERENCES CITED Ball, Joseph W. 1983.
