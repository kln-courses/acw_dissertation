<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEWS New York Richard Serra and Kenneth Noland Richard Serra's recent sculpture at the Pace Gallery (15th September to 14th October) and selected Kenneth Noland paintings from 1958 to 1989 at Salander- O'Reilly (4th October to 15th November) provided not only excellent displays of each artist's current concerns but also a fasci- nating paragone. How differently the works addressed the viewer was apparent through their respective installations. In Salander- O'Reilly's new and elegant Upper East Side premises, Noland's meticulous abstrac- tions appeared altogether at home. On leaving the elevator at Pace, however, the visitor at once confronted a spartan en- vironment whose limits were being tested by the massive objects within. It was a space of thresholds where all the plane surfaces had been forced to interact, some- times simply by their inertia alone, with the presences which were wedged, stood and propped against them. In short, Serra had characteristically made the erstwhile commercial arena into a 'site'. By com- parison, even the largest ofNoland's images exploit the containment and focus which is a hallmark of the easel picture. A similar contrast could be felt in the ap- parent timespan of the two shows. Although Salander-O'Reilly's was a virtual retro- spective, it remained compact whereas the three Serra pieces (Sessha Sesshd is in fact in two parts) were calculatedly diverse and open-ended. Since the controversy sur- rounding Tilted arc and its removal from Manhattan's Federal Plaza last year, Serra's stereotype has been of some technocratic Vulcan foisting brutal industrial monoliths upon a hapless populace. Certainly gravity is still his fundamental interest and in a statement for the accompanying catalogue he discourses upon what it is hard to resist calling 'the unbearable heaviness of being' according to which he regards the 'his- tory of sculpture as a history of weight'.1' Nothing could be less inert or stolid than the complex echoes between the three wings, each containing one work, of the Pace installation. Sesshd Sessha blocked both ends of the leftward side room. Its twin 75. Morning span, by Kenneth Noland. 1964. Acrylic. 262.1 by 392.4 cm. (Exh. Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, New York). panels are the very antithesis of sculpture and, with their delicate and cloudy surface patterns, resemble aJules Olitski painting cast in steel. Such solidity as they have is not actually intrinsic (insofar as we cannot even see the thickness of the steel) but is instead sensed as the volume of the corner which they obscure. As if to answer this denial of mass, Sternpost (Fig.74) material- ised the axes of the room at the far end of the gallery like some monumentalised Tatlin counter-relief. A precarious tilt emphasised its thrust through three dimensions and between these extremes the central 'T' of Blackmun and Brennan stretched outwards, a Samson to the entire ensemble (Fig.76). Both the title and anthropomorphic as- pect of Blackmun and Brennan express some- thing ofSerra's wider beliefs. His opposition to art as an institutional commodity is well documented and in its reference to two Supreme Court Justices whom he admires, this work has already been taken for a surrogate figure straining to hold back repressive forces. The trouble is that this evokes precisely the romantic mythology which Serra's exploration of raw and ab- stract material facts has sought to deny. Not surprisingly, therefore, the dialectic came to a head in the eight large black and white graphics shown simultaneously at Leo Castelli.2 Drawn or, rather, built up in oil stick so heavy that they become dark bas-reliefs, these rectangles bear such 74. 74.

Never- theless, Serra is at his strongest when he does not force the balance between concepts and things. Instead at Pace he proved how much can be said in a vocabulary that needs few terms other than gravity, balance, dynamism and their opposites. One went to Salander-O'Reilly with the concern that just such rigorous formal means as Serra's would have pushed Noland's less combative pictorial world into the boredom which overtook the out- put of his teacher Joseph Albers. This was not so, although to find Noland still working with the same geometric configu- rations and colour fields as he used during the 1960s came as a slight shock, which the substantial, well-illustrated catalogue hardly alleviated by reprinting the usual canon of modernist criticism, including ex- cerpts from Greenberg and Michael Fried.3 From their and, in truth, Noland's perspec- tive, the past two decades in which figu- ration and symbolism have returned to painting might never have happened. Or as Noland puts it in a forthcoming book, 'Things in a picture can't remind you too much of anything else.' Yet a majority of the Salander-O'Reilly canvases succeeded against the odds. From the first, Noland possessed a more steely vision than, say, Olitski, and it gave the 66</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS necessary edge to his day-glo palette. The chevron Morning span (1964, Fig.75) beamed out with an astonishing, electric vitality. An eye for the exact equilibrium between chromatic intensity and the area or format which best allows it to resonate has been his other forte. It was probably this instinct which led him to the extremes of horizontal compositions like Via gleam (1968). These images of rarefied tones have tremendous poise but they could be taken no further. Painterliness was the antidote. Returning to the chevron motif in the mid- 1980s, Noland also modulated his spectrum towards the most unlikely choices of shock- ing pink, magenta and cerulean. In the Doors series, begun in 1988, the buttery swathes of acrylic (and few major artists still use it nowadays) are layered over doors as supports with plexiglass wedges attached which seem to trap coloured light. What redeems them from being glitzy con- fections is a technical mastery which holds the luxuriance in check. If, on the evidence of this show, a steadfast formalism makes Noland a blinkered artist, he remains a consummate painter. DAVID ANFAM 'Richard Serra: Sculpture 1987-1989. Statement by Richard Serra.
