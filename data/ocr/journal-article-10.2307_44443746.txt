Dr. Lastres' 3 volume History of Peruvian Medicine forms Volume V of a collaborative History of the University of San Marcos. The History of Medicine is divided into The Pre-Inca and Inca period, The Colonial Era, and The Republic. This first volume is based on the most important sources in Spanish records and those of Peruvians such as Garcilaso de la Vega, Huaman Poma de Ayala, and Cristobal de Molina. Ceramics and folklore provide the remainder, since the Quechuas and Aymaras lacked a written language. This is not a political history, but a history of biological data relating to medicine, curative art, and folklore. Military chroniclers, missionaries, and naturalists in describing the Indian, never discussed his customs, his attitude to magic, the work of the Healers and their miraculous cures. Pre-Inca cultures were well advanced as indicated by such relics as bridges, irrigation canals, and aqueducts. They had tribal and community organizations on which the Incas later based their socialized Empire. This Inca Empire ex- tended from Ecuador to Peru and Chile, Bolivia, and Tucuman in Argentina. All these have identical invocations to Viracocha, the Creator, who had a shrine at Pachacamac on the coast and another in Andean Cuzco. With them illness was a result of sin, to be cured by confession and purification taking place at both the local level and at the great annual feast called Citua at Cuzco. This was a sort of collective prophylaxis against illness, with ceremonial rites at flood time, assuming that corporal ills accompanied change of seasons. The people bathed themselves and their arms in rivers which eventually flow into the sea. The priests scattered cornmeal over thresholds to protect the houses. Flocks were sacrificed and their blood, mixed with cornmeal, was eaten as a sacrament to purify the people internally. They must abstain from salt and hot peppers and remain continent. They prayed for health, prosperity, fertility, and security, with special prayers to Sun, Moon, Thunder, Lightning for the Inca, their Lord. Ceramic relics of most value are anthropomorphic water jars. These represent deformities, skin diseases, and punitive mutilations of lips, noses and feet. Arti- ficial deformation of the cranium by bandaging an infant's head up to its third year was much older than any recorded history in Peru. Ears and nose were pierced for large rings as part of the ceremonial in a child's growth, with special rites at puberty. Phallic symbols are profusely represented in their art. Love philtres and aphrodisiacs were used. They had a horror of incest, and specific degrees of consanguinity for marriage were regulated by law. Burial mounds disclose embalmed bodies covered with richly colored em- broidered cloths and surrounded by personal effects. The cult of the dead was founded in animistic beliefs in the influence of the spirits of the departed over the living. Mummies of past Incas were carried in procession at Cuzco at the great religious festivals. Prayers were chanted to Viracocha for the repose of the soul and that the body might not decay. To prevent decay they removed entrails and embalmed the body with bituminous balsams. In the dry coastal plain or the cold Andes, bodies were preserved several hundred years.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 189 The Mago or Medicine Man belonged to a definite caste with transmitted formulas, rites, and training. There were hierarchies of priests to invoke various deities for healing and to act as confessors; there were diviners who diagnosed by entrails of sacrificed animals or by heaps of scattered corn. There were also poisoners and illegal practitioners. Surgery was instinctive: immobilization of fractured bones, plastering flesh wounds, use of plants as astringents. Trephining of the skull was the most impor- tant deliberate surgery, and excites the interest of the anthropologist and the surgeon for a demonstration of skilled technique. Circular openings were usually accomplished by boring a chain of holes with a file and then breaking the bridges between them. The square openings were produced by straight cuts with the knife sloped so that the cut was beveled. This was to avoid breaking through the dura mater. Instruments used were of obsidian or bronze. The reasons for trephining are uncertain: perhaps to remedy an injury to the skull, but more likely as a means of relieving demonic ills such as dizziness and mental disturbance. The Indians described symptoms rather than diseases. They considered epi- demics a punishment for the collective sins of the people. Malaria, described as chills and fever, existed long before the Conquest; exanthematic typhus followed wars and the putrefaction of unburied dead. Mumps and goitre and verruga were endemic. Respiratory diseases have terms in their vocabulary. Pellagra also existed, due to a too exclusive diet of maize. The American origin of syphilis is still contested, but long bones and skulls found in pre-Columbian mounds have lesions that might be luetic. X-ray examination verifies this for long bones. There are Quechua and Aymara legends of venereal disease with characteristics of syphilis. Anesthesia was induced with strong potions of chicha, a fermented maize beverage. Analgesics and hypnotics, such as coca and the daturas, were used by the Indian to make him forget harsh reality as well as to deaden pain. Coca was restricted to the Inca and nobles till after the Conquest. It diminishes hunger and fatigue and its leaves mixed with lime have been chewed from a very ancient period. Obstetrics was practiced by magic. Prayers and sacrifices for successful delivery were offered to rainbow, moon, and tribal totem. Both man and wife must fast and confess to eliminate sins which might anger the gods. There were no mid- wives. Wizards used incantations or passed special amulets over the body of the woman, who usually returned to her duties promptly after parturition. Infants were nursed thrice daily, and the mother must not cohabit while nursing. Specific herb concoctions stimulated the flow of milk, and special ceremonials announced weaning. Herbalists knew the therapeutic and poisonous uses of numberless plants. Itinerant peddlers sold herbs, animal fats, and amulets. The SO or more known medicinal plants included astringents, diaphoretics, purgatives, sedatives, and aphrodisiacs. Oral tradition favors the pre-Columbian knowledge of the curative value of chinchona, the fever-bark, for intermittent fever. Natives concealed this use from the Spanish due to hostility. Indians of Loxa in Ecuador used it macerated in hot water or chicha as early as 1378. The Mago used superstitition added to herb remedies, carrying a stock of finger</page><page sequence="3">190 BOOK REVIEWS nails, hair, bones, and teeth. Drugs presumably had no intrinsic properties, only the presence of a spirit that infused them. However, the Healer continued to use certain drugs that had previously proved effective. They used some minerals: gold for epilepsy, silver for contusions, arsenic for ulcers, copper for boils. Animal products included doves' hearts, condor's blood, and various animal fats. Their bezoar stone came from the tapir, and they used a llama's placenta in childbirth. Hygiene was incidental. Ceremonial bathing was for purification from sin rather than physical cleanliness. However, among the social laws of the Incas was a regulation requiring the very poor to pay as tax a measured amount of lice, which was apparently a primitive method of combatting the spread of typhus. Psychotherapy, combined with potent drugs, was responsible for some miraculous cures. Hypnosis was produced by dancing and music; then the Mago apparently extracted harmful objects from the body of the patient, who viewing them on being waked, was cured. The primitive mentality was readily susceptible to suggestion. Georgianna Simmons Gittinger</page></plain_text>
